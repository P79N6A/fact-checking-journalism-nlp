      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight, from a rather cold and snowy Davos. See you in the morning for full coverage of Day 1. GW Here\u2019s the key message from Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s speech to WEF tonight, as he collected his Crystal Award. \u201cTo disfigure a woman by throwing acid on her face is one of the crudest acts of subjugation imaginable. At the source of it lies the view that a woman does not have the right to assert her choice,. We need to open access for each and every one with a true sense of ourselves, not as more powerful or less privileged but as equals.\u201d Rukh Khan\u2019s non-profit Meer Foundation provides support to female victims of acid attacks and major burn injuries through medical treatment and legal aid. The dancing is over, and I\u2019ve hotfooted it across from the Congress Centre to hear from Global Himalayan Expedition, an Indian social enterprise. GHE have a good story to tell too - they\u2019ve using solar panels and \u2018decentralized microgrids\u2019 to bring power to remote communities in India. We\u2019re watching a video now, about how a village who relied on kerosene lamps now have modern LED lighting. GHE\u2019s Jaideep Bansal, who is one of WEF\u2019s \u2018global shapers\u2019, explains that the children in the village used to trek three miles to school. Now they have an internet connection -- no sooner were they online then they were checking out their own region on Wikipedia. Inspiring stuff. More details here. Elton John\u2019s attack on inequality will, rightly, provoke reminders that he is himself fabulously wealthy - with an estimated \u00a3290m in the bank. But that\u2019s what happens when you shift a quarter of a billion records over a glittering career. And in his defence, the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF) has raised more than $400 million (according to WEF). From inequality to...ballet! WEF delegates are now enjoying a performance led by La Scala\u2019s principal dancer \u00e9toile Roberto Bolle, which I\u2019m told \u201cfuses the work of Antonio Vivaldi and Astor Piazzolla to explore the fine line between chaos and harmony in our relationship with nature.\u201d Finally, Sir Elton John receives his Crystal Award from the World Economic Foundation, for his philanthropic work. Sir Elton explains that he became a philanthropist because he had \u201clost who he had become\u201d, adding: \u201cI wanted to reconnect, i wanted to be a decent person\u201d. Sir Elton talks about the battle against HIV/AIDS - it was a death sentence 25 years ago, he says, but there are now millions of people on life-saving medicine. The musician ends by challenging delegates at Davos to deliver on their mission to improve the state of the world, adding; The world needs to be changed - the inequality in the world is, to be honest, disgraceful. Now, Bollywood star Shar Rukr Khan gives a moving speech about the strength of women, such as those who have suffered acid attacks, and children who are overcoming suffering. Collecting her WEF crystal award, Cate Blanchett tells the audience that we must rebuild the \u2018shared bonds\u2019 between people if we are to tackle the refugee crisis. The Australian actor laments the lack of empathy and compassion. She explains that if we can drop the \u2018loaded label\u2019 of the word \u2018refugee\u2019 it is earlier to see the person behind it. It is \u201cvery very easy\u201d to turn your back on those in need, if you don\u2019t think of them as fellow human being, Blanchett says, adding: Once you\u2019ve born witness you cannot turn away. Pope Francis has sent a message to the World Economic Forum, and it\u2019s a stern warning that capitalism is failing to serve the people. The message is being read by Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson. In it, the Pope says there is a \u201cmoral imperative\u201d to create the conditions needed to allow everyone to live in a dignified manner He\u2019s urges delegates at WEF to build a better foundation for a just society, that can restore dignity to \u201cthose who cannot dream of a better world\u201d. Pope Francis warns of \u201cgrowing fragmentation between states and institutions\u201d, with new actors emerging, and new economic competition and regional trade agreements. In a damning verdict on the world today, the Pope warns that \u201can ambition for profit at all costs\u201d is driving future fragmentation and individualism, rather than inclusiveness. He says: The recurring financial instabilities have brought new problems and serious challenges that governments must confront, such as the growth of unemployment, the increase in various forms of poverty, the widening of the socio-economic gap and new forms of slavery, often rooted in situations of conflict, migration and various social problems. Ordinary people risk being treated as mere cogs in a machine to be exploited, the Pope continues, adding: Whenever a human life no longer proves useful for that machine, it is discarded with few qualms. He also warns that artificial intelligence and robots must be used for the service of humanity, rather than to undermine it. Economic freedom must not prevail over the freedom of men and women, and their rights, the Pope says, declaring: We cannot remain silent in the face of the suffering of millions of people whose dignity is wounded, nor can we continue to move forward as if the spread of poverty and injustice has no cause. He concludes by wishing WEF his best wishes for a successful meeting, and invokes \u2018the divine blessings of wisdom and strength\u201d on those attending. Given the state of the world, I think they may need it.. Klaus Schwab welcomes delegates to the 48th World Economic Forum. He calls WEF the \u201cforemost multi-stakeholder group in the world\u201d. This year\u2019s delegates include politicians, business leaders, the heads of international organisations, charities and trade unions, plus the new generation of young global leaders. The point behind WEF is is that governments, businesses and civil society cannot solve the world\u2019s problems alone. He reminds us that WEF\u2019s ambition is to \u201cImprove the state of the world\u201d, and urges delegates to follow three rules: respect human dignity and diversity serve the community be a trustee of the next generation Delegates are flooding into the main Congress Hall at the World Economic Forum, as founder Klaus Schwab prepares to open this year\u2019s event. Despite the disruption caused by today\u2019s snow, the cavernous space is pretty packed. That may be thanks to the lure of celebrity. Schwab is going to hand over three crystal awards: Cate Blanchett, for her leadership in raising awareness of the refugee crisis Sir Elton John, for his leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS Shah Rukh Khan, for his leadership in championing children\u2019s and women\u2019s rights in India Just in: Nine out of ten business leaders in Britain are upbeat about the growth prospects for their companies this year despite uncertainty about the impact of Brexit. That\u2019s according to consultancy firm PwC, which has just released its annual survey of chief executives at a press event in Davos. PwC found that optimism about the health of the global economy was boosting confidence; 36% of business leaders expected the global economy to strengthen in 2018, up from 17% in 2017. But, the number of UK business leaders who describe themselves as \u2018very confident\u2019 has dipped to 34% from 41% last year. PwC also uncovered signs that British businesses are reining in their hiring plans. The number of UK business leaders expecting to increase headcount has fallen slightly to 54% from 63% last year, while 15% expect to reduce headcount, compared to 10% in 2017 In a disappointing development, global flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by 16% in 2017. That\u2019s according to a new report from UNCTAD - the United Nation\u2019s arm for trade, investment and development issues. UNCTAD reports that FDI shank to $1.52 trillion last year, down from $1.81 trillion in 2016. That indicates that companies cut back on spending on new factories and the like. FDI flows into Europe shrank by 27%, while in US it slumped by a third. UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi says FDI spending is on a \u201cbumpy road\u201d, adding: \u201cWhile FDI in developing countries remained at a level similar to the previous year, more investment in sectors that can contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals is still badly needed. Promoting FDI for sustainable development remains a challenge.\u201d As a measure of economic success, GDP has plenty of critics. It\u2019s too blunt, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between building atom bombs or orphanages, or take account of environmental damage or economic inequality. So, the World Economic Forum has just launched a new metric of national economic performance as an alternative to GDP. It\u2019s called the inclusive development index, and it attempts to do a better job of evaluating countries, by focusing on living standards, and whether policymakers are doing a good job of \u2018future-proofing their economies.\u2019 The index is based on growth and development; inclusion; and intergenerational equity, tracking metrics like GDP per capita; labour productivity; employment; and healthy life expectancy. So how does Britain do on this measure? Not very well, basically. The UK comes just 21st, some way behind Germany (12th), Canada (17th) and France (18th). But the other three G7 nations did even worse, with the US coming 23rd, Japan 24th and Italy just 27th. Norway, Iceland, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Denmark filled the first five places. The Treasury have sent a short response to today\u2019s IMF forecasts: \u201cWe are building a Britain that is fit for the future by improving skills, backing innovation and investing in infrastructure to deliver a stronger economy and guarantee a better future for the next generation.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction to the latest IMF forecasts: Although the IMF has raised its forecast for global growth, the UK has missed out. The Fund has cut its forecast for UK growth in 2019 to 1.5%, down from 1.6% previously. Although that\u2019s a small move, it\u2019s notable that other countries have seen their projected growth revised UP. For example, Germany\u2019s predicted growth has been raised from 1.5% to 2%, while the US is now on track for 2.5% growth next year. The IMF expects the global economy to expand by 3.9% this year, which highlights how the UK will lag behind. The IMF also expects UK GDP to increase by 1.5% this year, below its long-term trend, and much slower than the US\u2019s projected growth of 2.7% in 2018. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, pins the blame firmly on the government: McDonnell (who is due in Davos later this week) says: \u201cThe IMF report out today confirms what others have been saying \u2013 the UK economy is not growing as fast as many other advanced economies. It further exposes the effect of the last seven years of Tory economic failure. \u201cPhilip Hammond should drop his plans to continue the austerity policies that have weakened our economy. We urgently need a change of direction from the Chancellor. There is no excuse for a \u2018more of the same\u2019 approach. \u201cThe next Labour government will provide the serious investment our country needs, underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule, to build a high wage, high skill economy for the many not the few.\u201d Outside the IMF\u2019s press conference, the weather at Davos is decidedly wintery. Delegates are stepping off the train into a flurry of monster snowflakes, there are huge snowdrifts everywhere, and the roads are jammed in all directions. As usual, the whole resort has been taken over by the WEF circus, with security guards controlling the traffic and guards on the perimeter of the Congress Hall. On that note, I\u2019ll hand over to Graeme Wearden in Davos. Here is a link to the opening remarks by Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, at the World Economic Outlook press conference: Meanwhile US markets have opened lower, as investors concentrate more on the US government shutdown than the IMF\u2019s raised forecasts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 35 points or 0.13% while the S&amp;P 500 is off 0.06% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.01% lower. Final question: will China continue to play a bigger role [in the global economy]? Obstfeld: There is no question China is a major player. Chinese growth is incredibly important to world growth. It is important for China to support the multilateral system. It will require further steps from China, to open its own economy to imports and work on a range of issues. China\u2019s role is critical. Question on whether growth is even a worthwhile pursuit if not everyone benefits. Obstfeld says GDP doesn\u2019t measure the distribution of rewards [from growth]. You could do that but it would be a value judgement, and economists have struggled with this for centuries. How do you measure overall utility? You have to keep GDP as an anchor and where it does not get at all the social or welfare issues you want, you have to supplement it with other data. It will never be possible to have one number to summarise the totality of the happiness of people in the worlkd, but GDP is a key concept and we\u2019ll keep looking at it. Question on bitcoin and systemic risk. We don\u2019t like to comment on specific cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology in general, we see possible advantages. It\u2019s an interesting development. [But] cryptocurrencies offer risks, regulators need to watch them carefully. Do you expect US growth to become a drag on global growth after 2020? Obstfeld: The tax bill and its impact is complex, lot of uncertainty around our forecast. A lot of the impact is explicitly temporary. Could be a surge of investment in near term, when it stops could be some payback. But some [of the measures] are not temporary. So some potential for payback in US growth [could] result in slower import growth in the US which would affect trading partners. How big those effect would be is hard to predict. What role does China play now compared to ten years ago? How about the Federal Reserve? Obstfeld: China carried out large fiscal stimulus at time of crisis. Even though its growth rate has come down, it is still a major source of growth. there are challenges which the leadership has recognised in terms of strengthening financial regulations... the relationship between local and federal budgets. We see China as a strong driver of global growth going forward. As for the Fed we expect them to make data dependent decisions to achieve full employment and stable prices. Question on the risks facing the global economy. Obstfeld says, It is hard to identify one risk, policymakers need to think broadly and for the long term, not just the next political cycle. The next recession may be closer than we think and the ammunition to combat it will be less than previously, he says. On to the questions. The current upturn was not by chance, says Obstfeld, it owed much to accommodative macro economic polices. Our view is the current upturn is not likely to be a new normal. Advanced economies are leading the upswing, but will return to growth rates below pre-crisis levels. Demographic change and low productivity present challenges. The two biggest national economies driving growth, China and the US, are predicted to see lower growth in future. Easy financial conditions have also left a legacy of debt. There is less good news in Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa (in terms of growth). Voters in many countries have soured on political entities, with a turn to more nationalistic tendencies and this would harm longer term growth prospects. The overarching risk at the moment is complacency. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, says countries have to ask themselves three questions: how can we raise our economic efficiencies over the long term; how can we avoid this upturn ending in new slowdown; and how can we be sure we have the tools to counter the next downturn. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde says we should be encouraged by global growth but should not be complacent. There are too many people left out of the economic growth, she says. Also, this is mostly a cyclical recovery. And without continuous reforms, aging populations, low productivity etc will continue to weigh. There are uncertainties ahead. There is a troubling increase in debt across a number of countries. You may say it is for the IMF to see these risks, but what we see in the medium term does give us grounds for worry. She says now is a perfect opportunity for world leaders to repair their roof (as in repair the roof while the sun is shining.) We think policymakers should make the difficult structural and fiscal reforms needed. Boost long term growth, pay down debt where it is too high. Growth needs to be more inclusive, not only across countries but within countries. This requires training for workers at risk of being displaced by new technologies. We need new opportunities for young people, and for women. We need robust global co-operation if we are to tackle shared problems (tax evasion, climate change, corruption etc). The IMF is holding a press conference on the world economic outlook which can be viewed here. The global economy will grow faster than expected this year and next as Donald Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts provide a short-term shot in the arm, despite fears over rising inequality and overheating financial markets, the International Monetary Fund has said. Launching its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) report at the annual Davos gathering of the global elite in Switzerland this week, the IMF upgraded its growth forecast for the world economy by 0.2 percentage points to 3.9% for both 2018 and 2019. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said Trump\u2019s tax cuts, passed into law at the end of last year, should encourage businesses to invest in additional economic output \u2013 which should provide a positive, albeit short-lived, boost for the US and its trade partners. However, he said there are risks on the horizon from a potential sharp drop in markets after the recent surge in equity valuations. He also warned world leaders gathering at the Swiss ski resort in the Alps that they would need to tackle inequality and boost the resilience of their economies, or face a downturn that will \u201ccome sooner and be harder to fight\u201d than expected. \u201cPolitical leaders and policymakers must stay mindful that the present economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long,\u201d he added. The IMF\u2019s upgrade comes amid a synchronised global upswing, as the economies of the US, eurozone and Asia recover from the depths of the 2008 financial crisis a decade ago. However, the current economic sweet spot has been helped by central banks around the world keeping interest rates low and pumping billions of dollars into their economies through quantitative easing. Our full story is here: The view from the train on the way to the World Economic Forum in Davos, as seen by Graeme Wearden and Larry Elliott: Still with Greece, and ahead of the eurogroup meeting, the country\u2019s officials are expressing confidence that a new loan disbursement of up to \u20ac6.7bn will be granted. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Greek officials are calling today\u2019s eurogroup the beginning of the end of Greece\u2019s nine-year ordeal under international supervision. Even though some demanded reforms are still pending, insiders are not anticipating especially tough words from euro area finance ministers when they meet under Mario Centeno for the first time this afternoon. \u201cI am 99 per cent sure they are going to give us the green light for the next [bailout] instalment,\u201d MEP Stelios Koulouglou told the Guardian. \u201cWe are expecting soft stuff.\u201d Koulouglou, who represents the governing leftwing Syriza party in the European parliament, said disbursement would not only conclude the debt-stricken country\u2019s third compliance review but pave the way to the end of international supervision under its \u20ac86bn third bailout programme. \u201cAfter this there is a fourth, and last, review but it won\u2019t be at all as gruelling and then we will be at the end.\u201d Briefing reporters at 2 PM local time, the government spokesman, Dimitris Tzannakopoulos, said after today\u2019s euro group Athens would enter \u201cthe last stretch\u201d before officially exiting the programme in August. The government expected the bailout tranche to be \u20ac6.7bn \u201con the recommendation of the euro working group\u201d which advises eurozone finance ministers. \u201cOf that amount \u20ac5.7bn will be given [to Greece] by mid-February upon completion of technical prior actions [reforms] without a new meeting of the eurogroup,\u201d he said. There was good news for Greece and Spain from a couple of ratings agencies late on Friday, giving a lift to their bond prices today. Reuters reports: Spain\u2019s borrowing costs fell to six-week lows and short-dated bond yields in Greece tumbled on Monday, after ratings upgrades for the two southern euro zone states provided further evidence of a turnaround for the bloc\u2019s peripheral economies. Fitch upgraded Spain\u2019s credit rating to \u201cA-\u201d with a stable outlook late on Friday, citing a broad-based economic recovery and limited impact on the economy from Catalonia\u2019s independence bid. It was Spain\u2019s first \u201cA\u201d rating from one of the top three ratings agencies since the euro zone debt crisis. S&amp;P Global Ratings, releasing its review on Greece after Friday\u2019s market close, lifted Greek long-term, foreign currency ratings for the first time in two years on improvements in the finances and fiscal outlook for the debt-laden nation . \u201cThe fact that it is the first ratings upgrade in two years is a political win for government and the euro zone,\u201d said Patrick O\u2018Donnell, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London, referring to the Greek upgrade. The US government shutdown may be having little impact so far on global equity markets, but it has pushed the already weak dollar even lower. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling heavily flirted with $1.39 as it climbed 0.2%, while the euro crept back across $1.225 after rising by the same amount. Against each other, however, neither currency could gain the upper hand, with the pound effectively flat the wrong side of \u20ac1.134. Despite cable lurking around its post-Brexit peak, the FTSE managed to overcome its initial wobble this Monday, nudging back above 7730 \u2013 roughly 70 points off its all-time highs \u2013 as the day went on. The DAX, meanwhile, remained in the ball-park of its own record intraday high, sitting flat around 30 or so points away from 13500 \u2013 the latest news surrounding a possible German coalition between the CDU and SPD could only keep the index from dipping in the red, rather than propel it to fresh highs. Greece is edging closer to an exit from its bailout programme: The world faces a massive and urgent need to reskill millions of workers whose jobs will be eliminated by technological change in the next few years. A new report from the World Economic Forum shows that employees across the economy risk suffer falling incomes or unemployment as the 4th industrial revolution disrupts the workplace. To avoid this fate, millions of people need to be helped into new roles - probably into a whole new career path. Without reskilling, only 2% of workers have an \u2018optimal\u2019 chance of a rewarding new role, WEF says. But with proper investment in training, they reckon 95% of the most threatened workers could end up in \u2018good-quality, higher-wage work\u2019 in industries that are creating, not slashing, jobs. The report has analysed employment data to find \u2018good fits\u2019 for staff whose current jobs are at risk. For example, assembly line workers could retrain in construction, and metal fabricators could move into pipelaying. In old media, printers could swap their presses for tractors and become farm or ranch managers. Worrying, women will suffer the most if we don\u2019t get this right. Female employees currently carry out 57% of the 1.4 million US jobs expected to be disrupted by technology by 2026, such as secretarial and administrative roles. They also have fewer escape routes. Without reskilling, on average, at-risk women have only 12 job transition options, while at-risk men have 22 options. With reskilling, women have 49 options, while men have 80 options. Last year, WEF warned that 5 million jobs across 15 advanced economies would be disrupted by 2020. This new report is based on data from America\u2019s Labour market, but its conclusions feel relevant to a wider audience. Here\u2019s WEF\u2019s advice for those looking nervously at the future of work: For individuals, particularly those under risk of displacement, simply to remain employed will require engaging in lifelong learning and regular reskilling. Additionally, for all workers, continuous learning will not only be key to securing employment but also to building stable, fulfilling careers and seizing rewarding job transition opportunities. For employers, relying solely on new workers entering the labour market with the right ready-made skills will no longer be sufficient. And while predicting the exact nature of the demand for skills is impossible, recent research from the World Economic Forum reveals that across a wide range of scenarios, investment in workforce reskilling and human capital development is a \u2018no-regret action\u2019\u2014that is, it will be a beneficial investment even in the absence of skills shortages. For policy-makers, fostering continuous reskilling and lifelong learning across the economy will be critical in order to maintain a labour force with the tools needed to fuel inclusive economic growth and to ensure that companies can find workers with the skills needed to help them succeed and contribute their full potential to the economy and society. Time for a market update. The FTSE 100 has recovered some of its poise after its early dip, and is now up around 0.07%. Germany\u2019s Dax is virtually unchanged, while France\u2019s Cac has slipped by a marginal 0.04%. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Stock markets in Europe are a mixed bag this morning as investors access the political landscape. The shutdown of the US government hasn\u2019t spooked investors as there was a similar muted reaction the last time it happened in 2013, but nor has it given traders a reason to buy into the market. In Germany the SPD have agreed to begin formal talks with Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU. This is a step in the right direction for German politics and traders will be watching it closely. In the wake of the collapse of Carillion, rival companies have been successful in their contingency plans to keep projects going, says ratings agency Moody\u2019s. But they could face having to sign new contracts on less favourable terms, it adds in a new report: Project companies are satisfactorily implementing contingency plans to avoid an impact on services or cash flows after the liquidation of British construction and services firm Carillion. However, moderate credit deterioration is possible because some project companies will need to sign new contracts with alternative subcontractors, potentially with less favourable terms or pricing... \u201cProjects continue to provide contracted services despite Carillion\u2019s liquidation,\u201d said Kunal Govindia, a Moody\u2019s Assistant Vice President and co-author of the report. \u201cHowever, if replacement subcontractors are procured it could lead to an increase in operating costs, although there are mitigating factors.\u201d Staff wages, supplier invoices and other facilities management (FM) costs are ultimately paid out of the offtaker unitary payment and there is no reliance on Carillion having sufficient cash. Currently, project companies are continuing to observe the contractual payment mechanics. As part of their contingency planning, project companies had engaged with possible replacement subcontractors. Moody\u2019s expects that new subcontractors will join the various projects over the coming months. However, there is no guarantee that the new contract will be on the same terms and pricing. Project companies could potentially face increased FM costs without an accompanying increase in revenue. Two factors mitigate this risk. Firstly, soft FM services are benchmarked periodically and cost increases are passed to offtakers. Secondly, projects are resilient to FM cost increases, as demonstrated by generally adequate cost increase sensitivities. Meanwhile Kier has said around 200 Carillion employees working on HS2 and the Highways England smart motorway schemes have been offered the chance to join the company. We\u2019ve seen a number of companies jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon (step forward Long Island Iced Tea) and seeing their shares soar. And it hasn\u2019t peaked yet, it seems: A rather downbeat survey on UK household finances from IHS Markit: You would imagine stock markets would be rather edgy at the prospect of a US government shutdown. But apparently not. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 53 points on Friday, and the futures are indicating a small decline at today\u2019s open of around 44 points. And the long term impact on US markets seems limited: A new report on the growing gap between rich and poor is timely in the run up to the Davos meeting. Larry Elliott writes: The development charity Oxfam has called for action to tackle the growing gap between rich and poor as it launched a new report showing that 42 people hold as much wealth as the 3.7 billion who make up the poorest half of the world\u2019s population. In a report published on Monday to coincide with the gathering of some of the world\u2019s richest people at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Oxfam said billionaires had been created at a record rate of one every two days over the past 12 months, at a time when the bottom 50% of the world\u2019s population had seen no increase in wealth. It added that 82% of the global wealth generated in 2017 went to the most wealthy 1%. The charity said it was \u201cunacceptable and unsustainable\u201d for a tiny minority to accumulate so much wealth while hundreds of millions of people struggled on poverty pay. It called on world leaders to turn rhetoric about inequality into policies to tackle tax evasion and boost the pay of workers. Our full report is here: And here\u2019s Larry\u2019s reality check ahead of the meeting: And finally, a rundown of the hot topics in the chilly Alps: Ahead of the latest World Economic Outlook, Lord Jim O\u2019Neill - the former Conservative treasury minister and remain supporter - is optimistic about the outlook for the UK. In an interview with BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed, Lord O\u2019Neill said the UK was benefiting from better than expected global growth, and forecasts are likely to be upgraded, dwarfing the more gloomy predictions about the effects of Brexit. But O\u2019Neill, who is on the board of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said the question was, how much better would Britain be doing without the uncertainty of its future relationship with the EU. He said: I certainly wouldn\u2019t have thought the UK economy would be as robust as it currently seems. That is because some parts of the country, led by the North West [of England], are actually doing way better than people seem to realise or appreciate. As well as this crucial fact, the rest of the world is also doing way better than many people would have thought a year ago, so it makes it easier for the UK. A recent assessment suggested growth in the UK could be on average 3% lower by 2030 than it would have been if Britain remained in the single market and customs union. O\u2019Neill said: If that\u2019s the worst that Brexit will deliver, then I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Now, my own view is if we go for a really hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit, we\u2019ll probably suffer more than that 3%. But if it is only 3%, what\u2019s going on with the rest of the world - helping us - and with productivity improving, that will easily dwarf a 3% hit over 13 years, easily. He admitted the stronger performance could mean he and many economist had been too pessimistic about the effects of the Brexit vote: I\u2019m almost embarrassed to accept that it might sound like that. Because of course in principle I share the views of many that Brexit is a really weird thing for the UK to impose on itself from an economic perspective. And maybe this [better global growth] means the country\u2019s going to be able to cope with Brexit better than certainly somebody like me might have thought some time ago. But I would quickly add at the same time, I have felt for a good couple of years, as important as Brexit is, it isn\u2019t the most important thing facing Britain\u2019s future. Brexiteers are going to be like the cat with the cream. They\u2019re like \u2018there you go, told you so\u2019, which of course is ridiculous. He said major sectors of the economy closely linked to the EU, such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, were still facing significant threats if the UK does leave the customs union and the single market. Bookmakers\u2019 shares are showing losses on reports that the UK government is planning to cut the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals from \u00a3100 to \u00a32. It said in October it would reduce the stake to between \u00a350 and \u00a32, to tackle the \u201ccrack cocaine of high street gambling.\u201d A consultation period ends on Tuesday. William Hill is down 13%, Ladbrokes Coral has lost 12% and Paddy Power Betfair has fallen 2.6%. Analyst Alistair Ross at Investec said: A DCMS official apparently indicated that while no formal decision has been made, \u00a32 is \u2018highly likely\u2019. However Matthew Hancock, the new Secretary of State, has only just been appointed (9 January), and we think it is unlikely that a final decision on FOBT staking limits has actually been made. We also note that the FOBT consultation only closes tomorrow, and suspect speculation on the final outcome is premature. As expected it has been an uncertain start to the week for European markets. The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.13%, while France\u2019s Cac is down 0.1%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has lost 0.33% but Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 0.3%. More on the German coalition talks. Here\u2019s ING economist Carsten Brzeski: Given the very detailed informative talks in January, the official coalition talks should not take too long - if all parties stick to the desired results. However, the SPD delegate pushed the party leaders to renegotiate details of the informative talks regarding the healthcare system, the labour market and immigration, increasing pressure on the SPD to bring some new political achievements from the forthcoming talks. The willingness of the CDU to really re-open some of the most controversial issues seems to be very limited. ... However, once there is an official coalition agreement, all SPD party members, more than 440,000, will get the chance to vote for or against it. Compared with today\u2019s party congress, this party members\u2019 vote will be a much tougher nut to crack. And here\u2019s our latest report on the talks: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a fairly quiet start to the week at the moment but it is the quiet before the storm. Later today the Davos shindig kicks off, with the great and the good putting the world to rights. One highlight, if that is the right word, is Donald Trump\u2019s scheduled appearance on Friday, assuming it goes ahead in the midst of the US government shutdown. Also this week come the latest policy meetings from the Bank of Japan - which surprised the market by announcing an unexpected slowdown in its bond buying programme - and the European Central Bank. UK unemployment figures and UK and US GDP numbers will also be closely watched. But back to today, and ahead of the official start of the Davos meeting (the World Economic Forum to give it the proper name) comes the latest assessment of the global outlook from the IMF. Not everyone is taken with Davos though. UBS\u2019s Paul Donovan says: The data calendar is pretty empty today. This leaves markets at the mercy of media coverage of events at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Significant policy announcements are unlikely, but Davos does give journalists an opportunity to pontificate while wearing silly hats. It also gives locals in Davos the opportunity to rent out their premises to attendees and move out for the duration, as Rupert Neate reports: Markets are likely to open in a mixed fashion, as investors take on board not only the US government shutdown, but the news from Germany that it came a step closer over the weekend to ending its political stalement and forming a coalition goverment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Having seen the US government shutdown confirmed after last week\u2019s US close there might be a case for suggesting that stocks may well be adversely affected. This seems unlikely in the long run given that the shutdown, at least in the short term, is likely to be fairly limited in nature, given that by and large economic data from across the globe continues to show a fairly robust level of economic activity. Furthermore, dysfunctional US politics isn\u2019t really anything new, in fact dysfunctional politics appears to be becoming the norm, not only in the US, but the world over, even if in Germany we do appear to be starting to make progress on the formation of a new government after the German SPD party membership granted permission for the party leaders to begin new coalition talks with Angela Merkel. Despite this progress, and before we hang out the bunting, there still remains some way to go before any form of agreement starts to evolve into a workable arrangement between the various parties. Here is IG\u2019s forecasts for the market open: Also on the agenda today, eurozone finance ministers will discuss the improvement in the Greek economy in the first eurogroup meeting hosted by new president Mario Centeno.

To avoid this fate, millions of people need to be helped into new roles - probably into a whole new career path.</p> <p>Without reskilling, only 2% of workers have an \u2018optimal\u2019 chance of a rewarding new role, WEF says. But with proper investment in training, they reckon 95% of the most threatened workers could end up in \u2018good-quality, higher-wage work\u2019 in industries that are creating, not slashing, jobs.</p> <p>The report has analysed employment data to find \u2018good fits\u2019 for staff whose current jobs are at risk. For example, assembly line workers could retrain in construction, and metal fabricators could move into pipelaying. In old media, printers could swap their presses for tractors and become farm or ranch managers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9c447b2a539c5ae9de551d7df098edc5df59d3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9c447b2a539c5ae9de551d7df098edc5df59d3e/0_98_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From print worker to farmer?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From print worker to farmer?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christinne Muschi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Worrying, women will suffer the most if we don\u2019t get this right.

Without reskilling, on average, at-risk women have only 12 job transition options, while at-risk men have 22 options. With reskilling, women have 49 options, while men have 80 options.</p> <p>Last year, WEF warned that 5 million jobs across 15 advanced economies would be disrupted by 2020.</p> <p>This new report is based on data from America\u2019s Labour market, but its conclusions feel relevant to a wider audience.</p> <p>Here\u2019s WEF\u2019s advice for those looking nervously at the future of work:</p> <ul> <li> For individuals, particularly those under risk of displacement, simply to remain employed will require engaging in lifelong learning and regular reskilling. Additionally, for all workers, continuous learning will not only be key to securing employment but also to building stable, fulfilling careers and seizing rewarding job transition opportunities.<br></li> <li>For employers, relying solely on new workers entering the labour market with the right ready-made skills will no longer be sufficient. And while predicting the exact nature of the demand for skills is impossible, recent research from the World Economic Forum reveals that across a wide range of scenarios, investment in workforce reskilling and human capital development is a \u2018no-regret action\u2019\u2014that is, it will be a beneficial investment even in the absence of skills shortages.<br></li> <li>For policy-makers, fostering continuous reskilling and lifelong learning across the economy will be critical in order to maintain a labour force with the tools needed to fuel inclusive economic growth and to ensure that companies can find workers with the skills needed to help them succeed and contribute their full potential to the economy and society.<br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-22T12:31:57.154Z\">at 12.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a65c8dae4b0ff81ba72697f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-22T11:23:07.955Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a market update.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has recovered some of its poise after its early dip, and is now up around 0.07%.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s Dax is virtually unchanged, while France\u2019s Cac has slipped by a marginal 0.04%.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I certainly wouldn\u2019t have thought the UK economy would be as robust as it currently seems. That is because some parts of the country, led by the North West [of England], are actually doing way better than people seem to realise or appreciate.</p> <p>As well as this crucial fact, the rest of the world is also doing way better than many people would have thought a year ago, so it makes it easier for the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>A recent assessment suggested growth in the UK could be on average 3% lower by 2030 than it would have been if Britain remained in the single market and customs union. O\u2019Neill said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If that\u2019s the worst that Brexit will deliver, then I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Now, my own view is if we go for a really hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit, we\u2019ll probably suffer more than that 3%.</p> <p>But if it is only 3%, what\u2019s going on with the rest of the world - helping us - and with productivity improving, that will easily dwarf a 3% hit over 13 years, easily.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ed0652b66ab065f8ae3c58be976e465df77f24e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ed0652b66ab065f8ae3c58be976e465df77f24e/0_132_5220_3132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord O\u2019Neill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord O\u2019Neill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pilar Olivares/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He admitted the stronger performance could mean he and many economist had been too pessimistic about the effects of the Brexit vote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m almost embarrassed to accept that it might sound like that. Because of course in principle I share the views of many that Brexit is a really weird thing for the UK to impose on itself from an economic perspective.</p> <p>And maybe this [better global growth] means the country\u2019s going to be able to cope with Brexit better than certainly somebody like me might have thought some time ago.</p> <p>But I would quickly add at the same time, I have felt for a good couple of years, as important as Brexit is, it isn\u2019t the most important thing facing Britain\u2019s future.</p> <p>Brexiteers are going to be like the cat with the cream.

      "bodyText": "Nine out of 10 business leaders in Britain are upbeat about the growth prospects for their companies over the coming year despite uncertainty about the impact of Brexit, the consultancy firm PwC has reported. In its annual survey of chief executives to mark the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, PwC found that optimism about the health of the global economy was boosting confidence. The report said 36% of business leaders expected the global economy to strengthen in 2018, more than double the 17% who forecast an improvement during 2017 in last year\u2019s survey. Almost 200 UK executives were questioned as part of PwC\u2019s survey of the business mood in 85 countries, with 88% saying they were optimistic about their organisation\u2019s growth prospects for the next 12 months, broadly in line with the global figure of 87%. Kevin Ellis, the chairman and senior partner of PwC, said: \u201cRobust confidence levels among UK CEOs points to resilience in uncertain times, but this is tempered by a big dose of realism about the challenges ahead. Brexit uncertainty, regulation, availability of skills and cyber are key concerns but business leaders remain confident they can navigate through them.\u201d The report shows that UK boardrooms are braced for robots and artificial intelligence to transform the way they do business over the next five years, with 69% of executives expecting disruption from technological change. Ellis said: \u201cDisruption from emerging technology is now a fact of life and business leaders are considering how the fourth industrial revolution will impact their operations and employees. \u201cAt the same time, they also have the day-to-day demands of managing costs and growing their businesses. How UK businesses respond to these short- and long-term opportunities and challenges will determine their own and the UK\u2019s future success.\u201d In a separate report, the World Economic Forum said the UK came 21st in its new measure of economic performance designed to be an alternative to gross domestic product. Norway, Iceland, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Denmark filled the first five places in the WEF\u2019s inclusive development index, an annual assessment that measures how 103 countries perform on 11 dimensions of economic progress in addition to GDP. Britain was ranked fourth of the G7 industrial nations \u2013 behind Germany (12th), Canada (17th) and France (18th) but ahead of the US (23rd), Japan (24th) and Italy (27th). The WEF said a new performance measure was badly needed. \u201cDecades of prioritising economic growth over social equity has led to historically high levels of wealth and income inequality and caused governments to miss out on a virtuous circle in which growth is strengthened by being shared more widely and generated without unduly straining the environment or burdening future generations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The collapse of Carillion (Report, 22 January), following the BHS and Sports Direct scandals, indicates a systemic problem with UK corporate governance. The fate of large corporations is a public concern and only wholesale reform will ensure company boards prioritise long-term value creation over short-term profit. Under current company law, there is no positive obligation on directors to take steps to prevent serious impacts on employees, suppliers, customers, the community or the environment. Rather than tinkering, as proposed in its response to corporate governance green paper, consultation, the government should reform the Companies Act to create an obligation of this kind. An obvious way of strengthening corporate decision-making to take into account the interests of wider stakeholders is to put worker representatives on boards. The government must now reconsider its decision not to move ahead with this proposal. At present directors are rarely held to account. Only individual accountability will address this problem. Presiding over serious corporate failings should be a grounds for directors\u2019 disqualification. Marilyn Croser Director, Corporate Responsibility Coalition \u2022 The Guardian has provided excellent cover on the Carillion chaos. However, I do not believe you are properly reading the runes. Carillion\u2019s financial problems have been well-known in the city and no doubt with senior civil servants for over a year. I believe in these circumstances the government had no choice but to continue supporting the Carillion Ponzi scheme. Let us speculate what the fallout would have been if Carillion had gone bust in the run-up to the general election in June 2017. This would have cost the Tories their overall majority, even with the support of the DUP. To me it is no coincidence that Richard Howson resigned as CEO in mid-July 2017, shortly after the election. William Rae Mccrindle Chairman, McCrindle Group, West Kilbride, Ayrshire \u2022 I have been involved in bidding for and delivering small contracts in the charitable and not-for-profit sectors. The waste of resources at this level was shameful. Large outsourcing contracts must be massively worse. Bid preparation extracts enormous, unrewarded investment from unsuccessful bidders. Once awarded, at each link in the contracting chain routinely around 30% of the contract budget may be allocated to \u201ccentral costs\u201d, for delivery negotiation, feasibility studies, budget oversight and detailed quality assurance. A few layers in a contracting chain and 60% of the original budget could fall into this bureaucratic pit. Add the ludicrous salaries of top private-sector employees and the profit required by investors, and it is a wonder hospitals, schools or roads ever get built, buildings get cleaned or prisons get managed. Unsurprisingly, the salaries of frontline workers are pared back. Liz McGrath Former chief executive, Learning South West and former chair of Home-Start Bridgwater, Watchet, Someret \u2022 The real losers in this affair are the subcontractors who are owed four months\u2019 money by Carillion \u2013 and their employees. If Theresa May is really keen to govern for everyone, she could introduce sustainable procurement rules that require companies with government contracts to pay invoices within 30 days. Or is it an essential part of the business model and the others would go bust too? Ben Twist Edinburgh \u2022 Larry Elliott argues (18 January) that \u201cCarillion\u2019s problem was not that its profits were too high but that they were too low when things started to go wrong\u201d. That depends when you think the problems started. Until last year, Carillion was using its substantial annual profits to pay out a relatively high dividend every year (costing \u00a382.7m in 2016). In the investment world it was known as a high-yielding income play, which bolstered the share price on which the bonuses of its top executives were based. At the same time, Carillion had to use some of its profits to service large debts, which were incurred mainly to make acquisitions. In 2016, this cost a further \u00a339.6m in interest and fees to the banks. If Carillion\u2019s management had done less empire-building, they would have had less debt and could have sustained the dividend without hitting cash problems. As it was, the only way to have stayed out of trouble would have been to cut or scrap the dividend. But that would have hit the share price \u2013 and their bonuses. There seems no question that Carillion had, over many years, been extracting substantial profit from public sector contracts. The problem was that nearly all of it drained out of the business in dividends, interest and bonuses. This in turn points to a broader point: the Tories claim that cutting corporation tax from 28% to 17% of profits will lead to an increase in investment. The Carillion example illustrates why that isn\u2019t working.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is stripping out a layer of management from its stores in a move that puts up to 1,700 jobs at risk, in the latest effort by the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain to cut costs by \u00a31.5bn. The company said it wouldremove people managers, who handle recruitment and other personnel matters, compliance managers, responsible for health and safety, and customer experience managers, who oversee service in 226 of Tesco\u2019s largest stores. Their responsibilities will be shifted to 900 new roles, which will handle matters such as human resources across multiple stores and in Tesco\u2019s distribution network. The latest wave of job cuts are part of a plan to slash \u00a31.5bn from Tesco\u2019s cost base. It comes after up to 1,200 head office jobs were cut last summer. The supermarket\u2019s Cardiff call centre closes this month, with a loss of 1,100 jobs. Speaking about the latest round of cuts, Matt Davies, chief executive of Tesco\u2019s UK and Ireland business, said: \u201cThese changes remove complexity and will deliver a simpler, more helpful experience for colleagues and customers. We recognise these are difficult changes to make, but they are necessary to ensure our business remains competitive and set up for the future. \u201cWe hope to retain as many colleagues as possible in the new roles we have created and in the vacancies we currently have available.\u201d Pauline Foulkes, national officer for the shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw, said the changes were \u201ca further upheaval for Tesco managers\u201d. She said the union would be entering talks with the supermarket chain in an attempt to minimise redundancies and help its members stay employed in a suitable role within the business if that was what they wanted. Supermarket chains are having to rethink their businesses amid aggressive competition from Aldi and Lidl as well as a switch to shopping online and in small local stores. Costs are rising with the national living wage increasing to \u00a37.83 an hour in April after going from \u00a37.20 to \u00a37.50 last year. Business rate changes and the apprenticeship levy have also added to costs. Food price inflation has benefited the supermarkets in some ways over the past 18 months, helping them to deliver sales increases. But they have also had to absorb some commodity price increases partly driven by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote, as cash-strapped consumers shop around to keep costs down. In his first year in charge, the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, axed nearly 5,000 head office and UK store management jobs. More than 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 48 underperforming Tesco stores, and 3,000 put at risk when the chain cut night shifts in some supermarkets. Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Waitrose and Asda have also cut jobs as all the big grocers try to keep costs down. In October, Sainsbury\u2019s announced plans to eliminate 2,000 store and back-office roles as the supermarket chain looks to cut costs by \u00a3500m. Thousands of Asda workers at 18 underperforming stores also faced redundancy or a reduction in their working hours last summer. Tesco\u2019s latest round of cuts comes after it chalked up underlying growth of 1.9% over Christmas. Lewis said the chain had enjoyed \u201cphenomenal\u201d growth in food but non-food sales were disappointing and City investors complained the business had not delivered the \u201cslam dunk\u201d expected. Tesco blamed the disappointing performance on disruption caused by the collapse of the grocery distribution firm Palmer &amp; Harvey, which supplied cigarettes and other tobacco products to its stores, as well as poor sales of TVs and other non-food items. British consumers spent an extra \u00a31bn on groceries this Christmas as they shrugged off concerns about the economy to increase sales by 3.8%, slightly ahead of inflation. Aldi and Lidl both increased sales by a combined 16.8% in the three months to 31 December as they drew in 1m more shoppers, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel, while the big four supermarkets all lost market share.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, is to cut production at its Halewood plant as it blamed faltering sales after the Brexit vote and a tax crackdown on diesel vehicles. JLR said uncertainty around Brexit and the future of diesel cars had weakened demand. Its sales in Britain and Europe were flat in 2017 and the firm said it it expects tough conditions to continue. In a statement, JLR said it was planning production cuts at the Halewood plant, in Liverpool, which builds three Range Rover models and employs around 6,000 people. JLR said the cuts would take place in the second quarter of 2018. \u201cOngoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit is being felt by customers at home and in Europe,\u201d the company said on Monday. \u201cConcern around the future of petrol and diesel engines \u2013 and general global economic and political uncertainty \u2013 and it\u2019s clear to see why the industry is seeing an impact on car sales. \u201cFollowing a review of planned volumes, we are planning to make some temporary adjustments to the production schedule at Halewood in Q2.\u201d Britain will increase the amount of vehicle excise duty paid by almost everyone buying a new diesel car from April, which will likely hit Jaguar Land Rover. Diesel accounts for around 90% of JLR\u2019s UK sales. The news came as Vauxhall\u2019s owners, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, told trade union leaders that they do not want to close the Ellesmere Port factory, as speculation mounts over the site\u2019s long-term future. Fears for the future of the Vauxhall factory on the Wirral had been exacerbated after the French owners announced more job cuts earlier this month. Talks took place in Paris on Monday between Carlos Tavares, PSA\u2019s chief executive, and Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite. Unite had warned that PSA sales would be \u201cfinished for good\u201d in the UK if Ellesmere Port closed. Vauxhall also makes the Vivaro van at a plant in Luton. Vauxhall employs around 4,500 people at Ellesmere Port and Luton but over the past three months has announced plans to cut 650 jobs in the Wirral. McCluskey said the meeting was helpful and that PSA had signalled it wanted to keep the plants open. He said: \u201cWe had a frank exchange and are now clear on our respective positions. \u201cCarlos Tavares repeated his desire not to close UK plants, which is reassuring. \u201cOn behalf of Unite, I repeated our determination to safeguard the UK plants and if needs be our willingness to disrupt PSA\u2019s UK market share if the company fails to support this loyal workforce. \u201cI remain optimistic, however, that we can work constructively with PSA, albeit with the uncertainty and confusion caused by Brexit being a consideration for the company.\u201d McCluskey said that he would be seeking a meeting with the business secretary, Greg Clark, to press the government to create a more favourable climate for PSA investment. Manufacturers fear Brexit could yet impose higher costs and delays on production. PSA bought Vauxhall and Opel last year from General Motors. Although PSA pledged to safeguard jobs when the takeover was first announced, in October the new owner announced plans for 400 redundancies at the Wirral plant, which produces the Astra car. Earlier this month, PSA said it would require 250 more jobs to be cut in its recovery plan. Tavares said he wanted Unite\u2019s support to \u201crebuild the industrial footprint\u201d of Vauxhall. In a statement, PSA said the meeting had established \u201ca frank and constructive dialogue in order to study how to regain the competitiveness of the Vauxhall manufacturing sites in the UK\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The global economy will grow faster than expected this year and next as Donald Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts provide a short-term shot in the arm, despite fears over rising inequality and overheating financial markets, the International Monetary Fund has said. Launching its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) report at the annual Davos gathering of the global political and business elite in Switzerland this week, the IMF upgraded its growth forecast for the world economy by 0.2 percentage points to 3.9% for both 2018 and 2019. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said there were encouraging signs a decade on from the financial crisis, although she warned that too many people were being left out of the recovery. Lagarde also warned global leaders against complacency despite the boom in growth, employing the words of John F Kennedy \u2013 also used by former British chancellor George Osborne \u2013 that the \u201ctime to repair the roof is when the sun is shining\u201d. She said a fifth of emerging and developing countries had seen income per head decline in 2017, and argued for countries to retrain workers displaced by technologies and globalisation. \u201cWe are quite upbeat for immediate future, but what we\u2019re seeing in the more medium term gives us ground for worry,\u201d she added. Despite the global recovery, the International Labour Organisation said not enough new jobs were being created to match the growth in the number of workers. According to the UN agency, the global unemployment rate is expected to fall only slightly to 5.5% this year, from 5.6% in 2017 - although the number of people out of work is expected to stay about the same, at more than 192 million. The ILO also said progress made to curb vulnerable employment had essentially stalled since 2012, and was set to get worse, with an estimated 1.4 billion people in precarious work. \u201cThe global economy is still not creating enough jobs,\u201d said ILO director general Guy Ryder. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, passed into law at the end of last year, should encourage businesses to invest in additional economic output \u2013 which the IMF said should provide a positive, albeit short-lived, boost for the US and its trade partners. But it also said there were risks on the horizon from a potential sharp drop in markets after the recent surge in equity valuations. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, warned leaders gathering at the Swiss ski resort that the next economic downturn could \u201ccome sooner and be harder to fight\u201d than expected. \u201cPolitical leaders and policymakers must stay mindful that the present economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long,\u201d he added. The IMF\u2019s upgrade comes amid a synchronised global upswing as the economies of the US, the eurozone and Asia recover from the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. However, the current economic sweet spot has been helped by central banks around the world keeping interest rates low and pumping billions of dollars into their economies via quantitative easing. Obstfeld said the conditions were not the \u201cnew normal\u201d and might fade. A sharp rise in inflation could come about as a result of growth in developed nations, while central banks could unsettle financial markets by putting up interest rates more quickly than anticipated. The US president is due to address the ranks of politicians and billionaires on Friday. His tax cuts have been labelled by critics as a gift for rich people, with the fear that bumper corporate profits could simply be used to line the pockets of wealthy shareholders rather than be reinvested in greater production capacity and higher wages for workers. Much of the IMF upgrade to the global growth outlook comes as a result of the US tax changes, with the fund anticipating that the US economy can now expand at about half a percentage point more than it thought in October. US growth is forecast to accelerate from 2.3% in 2017 to 2.7% this year, before falling back to 2.5% in 2019. The IMF said that effects of the cut would begin to fade from 2022, as temporary spending incentives for firms began to expire. It also revised up its growth estimate for the eurozone, though it said it still anticipated the rate of expansion to fall from 2.4% in 2017 to about 2.2% this year and 2% in 2019. While the world economy benefits from a global upswing, the IMF held its outlook for growth in the UK, forecasting the rate of GDP expansion to moderate from 1.7% in 2017 to 1.5% this year. It also lowered its forecast for 2019 from 1.6% by 0.1 percentage points to the same level as 2018.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has lifted its forecasts for global growth, saying momentum is building in global economic activity and Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts in the US are likely to stimulate activity further. It says the growth momentum is expected to carry into 2018 and 2019, and it has revised upwards its global growth forecasts by 0.2 percentage points for both years, from 3.7% to 3.9%. But it has warned that extreme weather events \u2013 such as droughts in Australia, and hurricanes in the Atlantic \u2013 pose a significant risk to its positive forecasts, saying \u201crecurrent, potent climate events\u201d impose \u201cdevastating humanitarian costs and economic losses\u201d on affected regions. It has also warned growing financial vulnerabilities could derail its forecasts, as could increasing trade barriers flowing from poorly executed trade renegotiations between the UK and the rest of the EU, and between the US, Canada and Mexico. It says Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts are expected to stimulate activity, with the short-term impact in the US mostly driven by the investment response to the tax policy changes. It estimates the effect on US growth of the tax cuts will be positive through 2020, accumulating to 1.2% through that year, with a range of uncertainty around its central scenario. But it also warns the effect of the cuts will probably wear off quickly \u2013 before detracting from growth \u201cfor a few years from 2022 onwards\u201d. The IMF released an update of its World Economic Outlook on Tuesday. It came a day after Oxfam Australia released a report showing the level of wealth held by Australia\u2019s richest 1% grew to 23% in 2017, up from 22% the year before, with the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 70% of Australians combined. The report, Growing Gulf Between Work and Wealth, shows the wealth share held by the top 1% in Australia has been growing almost continuously over the past two decades, and income inequality has steadily climbed too, despite some fluctuations. The IMF says the pick-up in global growth last year was broad-based, with 120 countries \u2013 accounting for three quarters of world GDP \u2013 experiencing stronger growth in year-on-year terms, making it the broadest synchronised global growth surge since 2010. It says global economic output is estimated to have grown by 3.7% in 2017, which is 0.1 percentage points faster than projected in October, and 0.5 percentage points higher than projected in 2016. It has told policymakers that the current cyclical upswing provides an \u201cideal opportunity\u201d for reforms. \u201cShared priorities across all economies include implementing structural reforms to boost potential output and making growth more inclusive,\u201d the IMF update says. \u201cIn an environment of financial market optimism, ensuring financial resilience is imperative. \u201cWeak inflation suggests that slack remains in many advanced economies and monetary policy should continue to remain accommodative. \u201cHowever, the improved growth momentum means that fiscal policy should increasingly be designed with an eye on medium-term goals \u2013 ensuring fiscal sustainability and bolstering potential output. \u201cMultilateral cooperation remains vital for securing the global recovery.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "After a terrible year for jobs in 2016, the employment sector rebounded in 2017 with one of the best years on record. Not only did the unemployment rate fall to a five-year low, employment grew by more in one year than it has for nearly a quarter of a century. And in more good news, after full-time employment actually went backwards in 2016, last year saw a record growth of full-time jobs. In his first press conference for the year, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, was not surprisingly in a chipper mood. In 2017, employment grew by 393,000 (in trend terms) \u2013 the biggest ever calendar year growth in a nominal sense (which given population growth doesn\u2019t mean all that much). The 3.3% increase is the best since 1994. Best of all it was across genders: 2.7% more men were employed \u2013 the best growth since 2010 \u2013 while women\u2019s employment exploded by 4% \u2013 the best since 1995: It is a growth that accords with a view I have held for some time, namely, that while the government might be lagging in the polls, the economic and, especially, employment picture very much suggests the Coalition is in a solid position to be re-elected. The strong employment growth was also observed across the nation \u2013 only Northern Territory saw a decline. Queensland and New South Wales led the way, with even Western Australia seeing solid growth after four very lean years: It all meant that while our unemployment rate remains well above that achieved during the peak of the mining boom, at 5.4%, it is as good now as it has been since the start of 2013: The issue bubbling under all the good news about employment has of course been underemployment. But even here, while it remains high, it has fallen from the record levels that were reached at the start of 2017: And such falls in underemployment are not surprising given last year was really about full-time employment. In 2017, full-time employment growth of 3.9% was the highest calendar year growth on record \u2013 stretching all the way back to 1967: It came about because full-time employment grew strongly for both men and women. Of the 321,000 new full-time employment positions, 161,000 were women and 160,000 were men. That\u2019s unusual given there are around 2.2 million more men employed full-time. And it goes to the changing nature of our economy. For men, the big gain in work came in the construction industry. While that is not a shock given that industry is the largest employer of men in the nation, the 108,000 new positions created in 2017 for men in construction made up 61% of all new male employment. Of those jobs, a big chunk was in heavy and civil engineering construction \u2013 the benefit of the expansion of public infrastructure projects around the country. For women, the big driver of work was healthcare and social assistance \u2013 with an equal number for work in hospitals and childcare, and another sizeable number for aged care work. And while only 52% of women working in the healthcare industry work full-time, in 2017 nearly 90% of the newly employed women in that industry were employed full-time. It all adds up to prime aged workers (aged 25-64) being almost as likely to be working full-time now than ever before. Since the GFC, the hit to full-time work has mostly been felt by the youth \u2013 in 2008, over 36% of those aged 15-24 worked full-time, now it is just 26%: But while at the end of 2016, the percentage of those aged 25-64 working full-time had fallen to 55.9% (well below the mining boom peak of 57.4%), in the past year the surge of work has meant more people in that age bracket are employed full-time than any time in the past nine years: And while we are unlikely to ever again see the levels of male full-time employment that occurred during the mining boom, where nearly 76% of men aged 25-64 worked full-time (currently it is 73.4%), the increase in women working full-time shows no sign of slowing: At the end of last year, 41.3% of women aged 25-64 worked full-time, compared to 39% 10 years ago \u2013 the equivalent of an extra 145,000 women working full-time now than would have been had the level remained steady. And all of these good numbers also means that Tony Abbott\u2019s prediction prior to the 2013 election of creating 1m jobs in five years looks set to come to fruition. Since September 2013, 949,000 extra people have been employed. Something would have to go seriously wrong in the next nine months for an extra 51,000 new positions not to be created. It\u2019s all good news, and is a very good sign of the health of the economy. It also means the government will feel it has a strong case to make about its economic management as it shifts into pre-election mode. For the ALP, the focus will remain on underemployment and low wages growth. If those two should improve (a big if), expect the treasurer to become even more chipper in press conferences this year.",

      "bodyText": "Outspoken federal MP Bob Katter has questioned why two Queensland councils are paying $34m to build an airport to service a massive Adani coalmine, saying there is an \u201cunpleasant odour\u201d to the deal. In October Townsville and Rockhampton councils announced they would spend $18.5m and $15.5m respectively on an airport, hundreds of kilometres away from either city, at the Carmichael coalmine, as part of a funding deal with Adani. Parts of the deal are now subject to an investigation by Queensland\u2019s local government department, and last week the Guardian revealed that despite previously claiming they were paying to own the airport, the two councils will merely lease it from Adani. Now Katter has weighed in. The Katter\u2019s Australian party MP represents the seat of Kennedy in Queensland\u2019s far north. He said the fact the councils were being asked to pay for the airport raised questions about the mine\u2019s viability. \u201cI did not believe the news item when I heard it, that ratepayers of Townsville were going to be building an airport 200 to 300km away for a foreign corporation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the foreign corporation needs $18.5m, then I think we can safely assume the project is in real trouble.\u201d Townsville council has argued the financial contribution to the airport was necessary to secure 900 jobs for the city as one of Adani\u2019s fly-in, fly-out (fifo) hubs and the location for the company\u2019s headquarters. But the council has refused to release the terms of the deal with Adani, and Katter questioned how the agreement will guarantee job numbers. \u201cWe have written a letter to the council, asking specifically whether they have secured any agreement in writing with respect to jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cHave they asked the Adani corporation how many jobs they will control? How many will be controlled by contractors? \u201cHave they had a legal opinion of what their chances would be enforcing a contract against one of the bigger corporations on Earth? Why does Mr Adani need $18m off the Townsville city council for a project when he is purportedly outlaying $6,000m?\u201d The Guardian has previously asked the council whether the terms of the deal restrict Adani from flying in workers from airports outside of Rockhampton or Townsville such as Brisbane, but did not get a direct response. Instead, a spokesman for Townsville council said there were \u201cconditions in place to make sure the fifo jobs, and positions in Adani\u2019s headquarters, go to people living in Townsville\u201d. \u201cThere are also protections to ensure council doesn\u2019t spend money on the airstrip if the mine does not go ahead,\u201d a Townsville council spokesman said. \u201cTownsville ratepayers will not be financially penalised if the mine does not proceed.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More small businesses are to be given access to the financial ombudsman to complain about their banks under plans put forward by the City watchdog after scandals at Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it wanted to give as many as 160,000 more companies access to the ombudsman service, which until now has handled relatively small complaints on behalf of consumers and the smallest of firms. The ombudsman solved 336,381 complaints last year, with compensation awarded to one in six customers who had problems with a financial firm. Under the new rules, companies with fewer than 50 employees, turnover of less than \u00a36.5m and assets of up to \u00a35m would be given access. The development follows the scandal at majority state-owned RBS, where there were accusations that its global restructuring group had systemically mistreated small firms. Companies also suffered at the hands of a fraudulent loans scam linked to the Reading branch of HBOS, now part of Lloyds. Only the smallest firms, with fewer than 10 staff and revenues of less than \u00a32m, currently have the ability to make complaints. Many companies which are slightly larger still lack the financial firepower to take on the big banks in the courts.

      "bodyText": "The government could face a high court showdown with bookmakers over fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), amid industry dismay at suggestions that ministers have decided to cut maximum bets on the machines to \u00a32. The stock market value of some of the UK\u2019s biggest bookmakers slumped by more than \u00a3660m on Monday, following reports that new digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) secretary, Matt Hancock, favours tough curbs on the lucrative but controversial machines. Bookmakers have previously ruled out launching a judicial review of the department\u2019s decision, regardless of the outcome, due to the difficulty in proving the process was flawed. However, industry figures believe the government may have unwittingly opened the door to a legal challenge by appearing to take a decision before Tuesday, when a 12-week evidence-gathering period is due to end. One senior figure at a major bookmaker said: \u201cIf it looks like they\u2019ve ignored a lot of evidence and made up their mind there\u2019s a risk [of a judicial review] from someone in the industry. \u201cIf it\u2019s a disaster-case scenario, there must be someone who\u2019ll say we\u2019ve got nothing to lose.\u201d A source at another high-street bookmaker said: \u201cIt [a judicial review] is always a last resort but a departmental briefing has to be a major concern just days before the consultation closes.\u201d A departmental head at a third bookmaker said his firm could not afford to fund a legal challenge, but added: \u201cWhether in the larger scale of things we\u2019re approached to join an industry group is a different matter.\u201d Bookies gained more than half of their revenues from FOBTs last year, pulling in \u00a31.8bn from machines that allow gamblers to stake \u00a3100 every 20 seconds on digital casino games such as roulette. Campaigners against FOBTs claim they are particularly addictive, clustered in deprived areas, and allow gamblers to rack up huge losses. But in a statement to the stock market, Ladbrokes said a cut to \u00a32 would \u201cfail to adequately address any issue of problem gambling\u201d and have \u201cserious consequences\u201d for the survival of high-street bookmakers and the horse-racing industry, which is part-funded by a levy on bookies\u2019 profits. The bookmaker is in the midst of a takeover by the online gaming specialist GVC, with the value of the deal directly linked to the outcome of the review. An 8% fall in Ladbrokes\u2019 share price on Monday took its stock market value down \u00a3281m to just above \u00a33.1bn, indicating investors now think a cut to \u00a32 is more likely than it was. GVC\u2019s stock also declined, falling 4%. William Hill fell nearly 12%, cutting its stock market value by \u00a3347m. The DCMS insisted no decision on stakes had yet been taken. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted: \u2022This article was amended on 22 January 2018 to correct the headline. The total value of major bookmakers had at one point slumped by \u00a3800m, not solely at Ladbrokes.",

      "bodyText": "Dixons Carphone has said that higher iPhone sales lifted its revenues over the Christmas period, as it confirmed a change in leadership and a steep drop in full-year profits. The chief executive, Sebastian James, is leaving to run Boots and in April will hand over to Alex Baldock, currently boss of the online retailer Shop Direct. The finance director, Humphrey Singer, is also leaving. Dixons, which owns Carphone Warehouse and Currys PC World, posted 3% growth in like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland for the 10 weeks to 6 January, meeting City expectations. Group like-for-like sales beat forecasts with a 6% gain due to strong growth in Greece and Scandinavia. However, full-year profits will be down sharply from last year after a tough first half, as more expensive handsets deterred consumers from upgrading their phones. The group forecasts between \u00a3365m and \u00a3385m for the full year, down from \u00a3501m. The new iPhone X has been selling well along with big TVs, games, Dyson Supersonic hairdryers and voice-control devices. The retailer said it did better during Black Friday week than in its Boxing Day sale, mirroring the performance of other retailers. Profit margins fell slightly because it sold more large TVs and white goods, which are more expensive to deliver than smaller items. James said: \u201cThe consumer [business] is OK in the UK. We have seen this year a pattern of winners and losers and I\u2019m very happy that we are in the winners camp.\u201d He said Dixons was working hard on refocusing its mobile business. It is in negotiations on leasing deals to help customers who do not want to buy a phone outright. James played down the prospect of widespread store closures, saying: \u201cWe need a large store estate.\u201d The company has nearly 700 standalone shops in the UK. Dixons is rolling out \u201cgaming bunkers\u201d \u2013 it currently has two in Britain and more abroad \u2013 where customers can play games. James said: \u201cFor the remainder of this [financial] year we have an early Easter, a new Samsung phone and the first week or two of our World Cup promotion to look forward to.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The leader of Britain\u2019s biggest business lobby group is to call for a \u201cjobs first\u201d Brexit transition deal to be negotiated within 70 days. In a speech on Monday, Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, will also call for Theresa May\u2019s government to show greater urgency in Brexit talks to give clarity to companies that will otherwise need to trigger alternative plans, including moving jobs and investment offshore. She will say that a no-deal scenario would be an act of \u201cgreat economic self-harm\u201d, by imposing billions of pounds of costs on UK goods sold to the EU and vice versa, and existing trade deals between the EU and Canada and the EU Norway would not be the best solution for Britain. \u201cEconomics and prosperity must be put ahead of politics and red lines,\u201d she will say, according to excerpts of the speech released on Sunday. Fairbairn, speaking on ITV\u2019s Peston On Sunday, warned the prime minister that the UK must stay inside a comprehensive customs union with the European Union to maintain strong trade links with its biggest markets after Brexit. May ruled out remaining a member of the European single market and customs union a year ago, saying Britain wanted the freedom to negotiate its own trade deals. Liam Fox, the trade minister, has argued that businesses should turn their attention from the EU to the US and faster growing markets in the far east, South America and Africa. Fairbairn said Britain\u2019s businesses valued the certainty of existing free trade in Europe above and beyond possible future trade deals elsewhere. \u201cLooking at this hard choice around customs union or not, the value of our frictionless trade within the European Union is worth more than having the potentially unknown value of trade deals in other parts of the world,\u201d she told Peston On Sunday. Business leaders are known to be spooked by the hard line taken by France and Germany in recent weeks over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the UK, especially as so many large companies rely on imports of equipment and parts from the continent. In a meeting with May last week, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, stressed that the UK would need to pay to gain access to EU markets and must agree to abide rules laid down in Brussels. The British government said it had already made good progress in Brexit talks, with agreements in a range of issues such as citizen\u2019s rights and the financial settlement, and it was confident it could negotiate a bespoke trade deal. \u201cThe EU has said they will offer their most ambitious free trade approach and we are confident of negotiating a deep and special economic partnership that includes a good deal for financial services \u2013 that will be in the EU\u2019s best interests, as well as ours,\u201d a Department for Exiting the European Union spokeswoman said. \u201cBut, as the prime minister has already made clear, we will be leaving the single market and the customs union after EU exit day.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unions representing Bangladeshi textile workers have reached a landmark $2.3m settlement with a multinational apparel brand after it was accused of delays in remedying life-threatening hazards at its factories. The settlement was agreed after a two-year arbitration process under the legally binding Bangladesh Accord for Fire and Building Safety. The accord was set up in the wake of the fatal collapse of the Rana Plaza textile factory complex in 2013, which killed 1,135 people in what is considered the world\u2019s worst textile industrial disaster. Many of the world\u2019s largest brands, including Adidas, H&amp;M, Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, Top Shop and Uniqlo are signatories to the accord. There is no evidence that any of these brands is the company involved in the settlement. The brand, which cannot be named under the terms of the settlement, has agreed to pay $2m to fix issues at more than 150 garment factories in Bangladesh. A further $300,000 will be paid to the two unions that brought the case, IndustriALL Global Union and UNI Global Union, to fund their joint \u201csupply chain worker support fund\u201d, an initiative that supports union-backed efforts to improve pay and conditions for workers in global supply chains. Christy Hoffman, UNI Global Union\u2019s deputy general secretary called the settlement \u201cground breaking\u201d. \u201cThis proves the validity of the arbitration process. It\u2019s a turning point for business and human rights,\u201d she said. The case, heard at the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague, was brought after the unions complained that basic safety features at the factories, such as the presence of locked gates, structural faults and a lack of fire doors and sprinkler systems, had not been addressed despite pledges to the contrary. The case\u2019s filing in October 2016 did, however, spur action. One factory went from a remediation rate of 56% in October 2016 to more than 90% in October 2017. But other factories supplying the brand continued to lag far behind and serious structural and fire safety issues were left unresolved. IndustriALL\u2019s general secretary, Valter Sanches, said: \u201cThis settlement shows that the Bangladesh Accord works. It is proof that legally binding mechanisms can hold multinational companies to account. We are glad that the brand in question is now taking seriously its responsibility for the safety of its supplier factories in Bangladesh. Their financial commitment serves as an example for other brands to follow.\u201d This is the second arbitration case to be settled under the accord. In December 2017, IndustriALL and UNI reached another agreement with a brand using more than 200 factories in Bangladesh. However, that settlement was reached under an even tighter confidentiality agreement and even the amount of the settlement was kept under wraps. Accord inspectors have so far carried out inspections on more than 1,800 factories supplying more than 200 brands and identified over 118,500 fire, electrical and structural hazards. A 2016 report by the Asia Floor Wage Alliance found little progress had been made to improve labour conditions for garment workers since the Rana Plaza disaster. Child labour remains rampant and protests over pay and conditions have led to strikes in Bangladesh, which ranks behind only China as a supplier of clothes to western countries. But Hoffman said that despite remaining issues the accord agreement has had a significant impact. Some 83% of workplace dangers identified in the accord\u2019s original round of inspections have now been addressed. \u201cThere has been a significant level of change,\u201d said Hoffman. \u201cHowever, we are pushing for 100% and we want to make sure that the funds are there for us to get over the finishing line.\u201d The collapse of the Rana Plaza complex, which supplied clothes to retailers including Benetton, Primark and Walmart, triggered a global outcry over the treatment of workers in Bangladesh. A second accord agreement was signed in June of this year. It goes into effect when the original agreement expires in May 2018 and extends the accord\u2019s protections until 31 May 2021.",
