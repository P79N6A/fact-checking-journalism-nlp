    "webTitle": "House prices rising in every region in England \u2013 Land Registry", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House prices in every region of England rose in September, according to official data published on Monday which reignited the debate about the prospects of a new house price bubble. The Land Registry data showed that even before the government accelerated the second phase of its Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, prices had increased 3.4% in a year on average, and were higher than in September 2012 in all English regions. However, prices in Wales were down by 1.7% year on year and fell by 0.4% in September. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"There is a mounting danger that house prices could really take off over the coming months, especially if already significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is lifted appreciably further by the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, which will take full effect in January.\" Overall house prices in England and Wales continued to rise in September, increasing by 1.5% over the month to an average of \u00a3167,063, according to the Land Registry. This remained below the peak reached in November 2007, when average prices hit \u00a3181,839. There was also a jump in the number of homes sold for more than \u00a31m. The data, which does not include newbuild homes or those which have not changed hands since 1995 \u2013 but unlike other indices does include cash sales \u2013 covers the period before the launch of the second part of the government's controversial Help to Buy scheme earlier this month. The scheme gives a taxpayer-backed guarantee to lenders offering 95% mortgages that are open to first-time buyers and home movers on newbuild homes worth up to \u00a3600,000. Critics have argued it will further fuel an already rising market. But the Land Registry showed discrepancies among the regions and within the regions. London's housing market experienced the greatest annual price increase in September, of 9.3%, and while all the English regions showed growth, some boroughs experienced falls. Hartlepool, for instance, recorded the greatest annual price fall, of 9%, while even within London there were variations. Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics, said he was still doubtful that the boom in house prices seen in some areas of the capital would spread to other parts of the country. \"House prices are already elevated, real earnings are falling and although mortgage lending is beginning to recover, there is no evidence banks are desperate to expand their mortgage books,\" he said. \"That said, by stoking up expectations of a house price boom, the Help to Buy scheme does represent an upside risk to prices. And if prices rise without a surge in mortgage lending, the Bank of England will be less willing, and able, to use their new powers to take the heat out of the market.\" The latest snapshot of the market shows that over the past 12 months, prices have increased by 3.4% on average, and are higher than in September 2012 in all English regions. In Wales, however, prices are down by 1.7% year-on-year and fell by 0.4% in September. The Land Registry figures show that house sales increased by more than 15% in the early summer, with an average of 62,034 a month between April and July, compared with 53,698 in the same period the previous year. The number of properties sold for more than \u00a31m in July was up by a third on the previous year at 1,143, of which 801 were in London. The imbalance of demand for homes and properties on the market in some areas has been one factor driving up prices, and in London, where there are large numbers of would-be buyers, the Land Registry said prices were up by 9.3% annually and by 1.9% over the month. The monthly rise was larger in the north-east of England, which recorded a 2.7% increase; however, annually prices were up by just 1.3% to an average of \u00a3101,262. In London, the average price of a home is now \u00a3393,462, the Land Registry said. However, prices and price inflation range widely across the capital. In Hackney, prices were up by 12.8% year on year, and by 1.2% in September, to an average of \u00a3474,202, while in Newham they fell by 2.5% over the year and 0.3% over the month to an average of \u00a3225,738. In the UK's most expensive borough, Kensington &amp; Chelsea, prices rose by 7.5% over the past 12 months to an average of \u00a31.16m. Outside London, prices are still plummeting in some parts of the country. In Hartlepool they dropped by 2.1% over the month and were down 9% on the previous year, to an average of \u00a376,597, while in Torfaen in south Wales prices dropped by 2.8% in September and by 6.9% over the year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Libor rigging scandal could be reignited on Tuesday when Dutch mutual Rabobank is expected to become the fifth financial institution to be hit with a huge fine for attempting to rig the benchmark interest rate. The bank is thought to be facing fines of more than \u00a3600m from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, who are continuing their investigations into alleged manipulation of the key interest rate. London's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and regulators in the US are thought to be poised to levy larger than expected penalties on Rabobank, a co-operative-style institution whose roots lie in financing agriculture and which escaped the financial crisis without a taxpayer bailout. The bank has been warning that it faced a fine for Libor rigging since the summer when it revealed it had made a provision of an undisclosed sum in preparation for the regulatory action. The Libor scandal was first exposed in June 2012, when Barclays was fined \u00a3290m for its role in attempting to manipulate the rate; its top management was subsequently forced out. Since then Royal Bank of Scotland, Swiss bank UBS and the money broker Icap have been fined. UBS received the highest penalty of \u00a3940m. Rabobank said last week that details of its punishment were getting closer to publication. \"Various authorities have almost completed their investigation into Rabobank's role in the Libor and Euribor setting process,\" the bank said. \"Rabobank expects to be able to enter into settlements with these authorities within the next two weeks. Rabobank is not yet in a position to comment on possible settlement amounts.\" When it took a provision for Libor, it said it had been named as defendant in civil litigation in the US and that it would defend itself against any such claims. At the time of the fine against Barclays City regulators said they were investigating seven other potential cases, which appears to indicate there are still three outstanding.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Look east along the river Thames from central London and the legacy of Paul Reichmann, the property developer who has died aged 83, rears up in full view. As the driving force behind the Canary Wharf complex that rose on what were once desolate docklands, Reichmann left an indelible mark on the capital. With its landmark tower topped by a blinking pyramid that attracted the ire of the Prince of Wales, Canary Wharf tore at hundreds of years of history by shifting the centre of gravity of London's financial centre. Reichmann was arguably one of the first to understand that the east was where London's future lay. But Reichmann's ambition wrought even wider change on the capital; the soaring towers of the office complex helped to break London's long-standing aversion to skyscrapers. Its skyline is changing, not least in the traditionally conservative Square Mile, now embracing buildings including Norman Foster's Gherkin, the Heron Tower and Richard Rogers's nearly completed \"Cheesegrater\". Reichmann, who lived in Canada from 1956, was one of the world's foremost property developers. His former company Olympia &amp; York is widely credited with helping to transform his adopted home of Toronto into a world-class city. The business also developed the World Financial Centre in New York, but the most ambitious project of them all was Canary Wharf, a scheme he originallywanted to call City of London East. In an oft-cited statistic, the Reichmann family was, at its peak, worth more than the entire population of New Zealand. Forbes magazine ranked them the fourth richest family in the world in 1991, worth $12.8bn. Reichmann, though, was far from the brash property tycoon of popular imagination. He lived relatively modestly, in what was described as a comfortable home in Toronto, and drove an old Cadillac. Interviewers would note his sombre dark suits, his slouching 6ft frame and his soft voice. He would shuffle around the office in stockinged feet. An orthodox Jew, he wore his hair slicked back, a beard and yarmulke. His staff knew him affectionately as \"Mr Paul\" and one former colleague described him as having \"an incredibly powerful intellect\". He was a reluctant interviewee. The writer Anthony Bianco, who produced a book on the family's history, described Reichmann as \"a capitalist daredevil in the guise of an undertaker\". Reichmann is also noted for losing the family fortune when Olympia &amp; York collapsed in the early 1990s under the weight of massive debt. But he was nothing if not tenacious. He bought Canary Wharf back and floated it on the London Stock Exchange before getting out for good in 2004. Although his wealth would never again scale the dizzying heights of the 1980s, his branch of the Reichmann family was estimated to have got back over the $1bn mark. The third of five children, he was born in Vienna but his family fled Austria at the beginning of the second world war to a temporary home in Morocco. His Hungarian father, Samuel, had worked as a poultry farmer: after leaving Vienna, he became a currency trader. His mother Ren\u00e9e took in piecework to finance a scheme to get food to Nazi death-camp inmates via the Red Cross and secured visas for 1,200 Jews. Many of their relatives died; of the couple's 19 brothers and sisters, only four survived. Reichmann and his family were well known for their philanthropy, particular in furthering their religion. With his brothers, Paul created and supported a network of schools, synagogues and kollelim, centres of Jewish learning. He remained devoutly religious during his life and those who knew him often attributed his success to his faith. The Reichmanns would send workers home early on Fridays to observe the sabbath and built an automatic lift in their mother's Toronto home so that she would not need to press a button and break sabbath rules. He was engaged to Lea Feldman from the age of 15, and married her in 1955 in Montreux. He attended various Jewish schools, including one in Israel and another in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. He ran a Jewish educational institute in Casablanca and his parents hoped that he would become a teacher. Instead, Reichmann fell into property. He would tell the story of how his family, by then settled in Canada, decided it needed a new warehouse for its Toronto tile company. He balked at the lowest tender of $125,000 for construction. He got it built instead for $70,000, selling a year later for a $34,000 profit. He co-founded Olympia &amp; York with his brothers Albert and Ralph in 1958. Starting a property business in Toronto in the late 1950s was well timed. The city underwent a huge boom as it became a financial centre in the following decades and the Reichmann family rode the wave. Their flagship was the 72-storey First Canadian Place, the nation's tallest building, built in 1975. One of Olympia &amp; York's most astute bets was to invest heavily in New York in the late 1970s, when the city was on its knees, only to realise massive profits years later. Reichmann rarely took holidays and claimed not to suffer from stress because he enjoyed his work. Canary Wharf was not Reichmann's idea. The credit instead goes to a Texan banker, G Ware Travelstead. But in the early 1980s the City, steeped in tradition, was not receptive and he eventually knocked on the door of Olympia &amp; York. Reichmann inspected the mostly derelict site, formed by a loop in the Thames, and did his own research among London's financial community. \"I had 29 meetings with business leaders in London to see if such a project made sense,\" he told the National Post newspaper. \"I did not ask them if they would move to Canary Wharf. The answer would have been no. My main question was: are you happy with your operating premises or do you see the need to do something dramatic? What I detected was the great majority were very unhappy with their premises, but their attitude was that they had no choice.\" Reichmann befriended the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who agreed to provide generous tax benefits to make the scheme financially viable. He was determined to make Canary Wharf work. \"An opportunity to do something like Canary Wharf happens once in a lifetime,\" he said. In the early years, many derided the development as a white elephant, a towering folly looming over London that lacked character and, more importantly, decent transport links. If workers remained sniffy about the Docklands Light Railway, the Jubilee line underground extension in 1999 changed the game entirely. The banks Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse First Boston, HSBC and Citigroup, and the Financial Services Authority became tenants. Barclays was the last clearing bank to leave Lombard Street for Canary Wharf, in 2005. Much of Fleet Street decamped east, including the Telegraph, the Mirror and the Independent, although of these only the Mirror remains. But it was far from smooth sailing for Reichmann. In the early 90s, there was a property crash that toppled Olympia &amp; York. The company had also diversified into other businesses in the late 1980s, and borrowed heavily to do so, which Reichmann later admitted was a mistake. Banks started to question the company's crumbling finances. He sought help from Thatcher's successor, John Major, asking him to relocate government offices to the development. Major refused. In May 1992, the firm missed a critical $17m bond payment. By the middle of that month it had filed for bankruptcy and Canary Wharf was placed in administration. The banks were unusually swift to cut off the flow of cash, angered because Reichmann had kept assuring them that all was well. Olympia &amp; York's finances were famously complex and opaque to outsiders. In one apocryphal story, bankers at Salomon Brothers complained that they were refused access to the books when they were underwriting a $1bn bond. Reichmann eventually relented. The bankers were herded into a room where documents had been taped to a table and they were given a short time to memorise what they could. The brothers went their separate ways after the collapse. Paul Reichmann, his critics said, did not know when to play it safe and always wanted to best himself with bigger and bigger projects. According to Bianco, his biggest failing was that \"he couldn't bear to part with his buildings\". Reichmann did not dodge the blame. \"At Olympia &amp; York I was the guilty party,\" he told the Sunday Times. \"People who try to cover up mistakes by blaming other people are showing weakness.\" But the crash failed to destroy Reichmann's formidable reputation in the property market: or his determination to see Canary Wharf through to success. In 1995, he pulled together a consortium of investors including Wall Street banks, the Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal and the American media mogul Larry Tisch for a \u00a3800m bid to buy Canary Wharf back from the creditors. As the property market recovered and Canary Wharf continued to attract new tenants, Reichmann floated the business in 1999. Vindication was in sight. But there was another slump in property values. He finally lost control of the business in 2004 during an ugly takeover battle. The company was acquired by Songbird Estates, a consortium led by the American investment bank Morgan Stanley, and Reichmann shortly afterwards sold his remaining shares, ending a 20-year involvement with the project. Retirement was never foremost in his mind. He seemed puzzled when asked why he was still working well into his 70s. He only passed the chief executive job of his private property company, Reichmann International, to his fourth child, Barry, when he was 74. Reichmann is survived by Lea and their five children. \u2022 Paul Reichmann, property developer, born 27 September 1930 ; died 25 October 2013",

    "webTitle": "Auditors must rotate, urges Olympus whistleblower Michael Woodford", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Michael Woodford, the former Olympus president turned whistleblower, has attacked the decision of the Competition Commission not to seek automatic rotation of company auditors. Woodford, who sounded the alarm in 2011 over a \u00a31.1bn fraud at the Japanese camera and optical instruments company, says a mandatory change is needed to prevent similar scandals at other companies. In his book Exposure: Inside the Olympus Scandal, Woodford revealed how the close relationship between Olympus and its audit firm KPMG over many years had reduced the likelihood of fraud coming come to light. \"You should rotate every 10 years,\" he told the Guardian. \"You should let people know there's going to be another partner coming in and it would lead to more conservatism. So I believe in compulsory rotation of auditors.\" Woodford, a leading witness in a Serious Fraud Office prosecution of Olympus and its UK subsidiary, Gyrus, which started last month, dismisses fears that large companies will not be able to move their audit work between the Big Four of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, EY and KPMG. \"I don't agree with the opinion that there will be problems finding another capable auditor. Some companies are deliberately changing their auditors, to demonstrate good governance. \"I disagree with the decision because four is better than one, and if you allow an auditing relationship to go year after year, common sense tells you that cannot be ideal. You get a degree of comfort by working with the same people, and ultimately with both parties endorsing a decision which other people may take a view on. There's a huge amount of lobbying against it by the auditing practices, saying it would cost whatever.\" The commission has said there should be a compulsory tender of the audit every 10 years, but no obligation for the auditor to change, despite a call from leading shareholders for a mandatory rotation. Instead, the commission called for more audit work to be overseen by the Financial Reporting Council or the government, more nuanced audit reports and an expanded role for audit committees. Woodford, who has maintained a vigorous media profile since he was fired by Olympus soon after he spoke out, is also calling for better protection for whistleblowers. Having joined the Commission on Whistleblowing set up by charity Public Concern at Work, he says: \"You may need legislation or a code of practice, requiring corporations to show they have whistleblowing lines. It would mean you could set up a whistleblowing line where it reports externally to a law firm or the best person internally, such as the chairman of the audit committee, or the chairman.\" An effective whistleblowing line should be separated from the executive of an organisation, says Woodford. What shaped his experience was the determination of the Olympus directors at first to deny the fraud existed before firing him and launching an aggressive public campaign to discredit him. \"You should filter out minor complaints, but if you have a serious issue where you think criminality may have been perpetrated, or an issue that is wholly against the public interest \u2026 and you feel uncomfortable raising it with your line report, then you should do this.\" Woodford says that the greatest hurdle for whistleblowers is often the fear of being victimised. \"If you're making allegations and it's criminal, then at some point you cannot remain anonymous, and this is why companies are uncomfortable, because it creates the situation of what do I do with this person?\" Woodford recognises that he was in a better position than many whistleblowers because he was in the most senior position at Olympus. \"It also helped that the amounts were large, so it was newsworthy and I could get the focus of the world's media on this issue,\" he adds. But at the beginning, few in the media would take him seriously, especially in Japan. \"It's easy in retrospect, but in those months the story seemed so extraordinary and journalists were very careful and very cautious and the Japanese media was acting like the press office of Olympus. I had to appoint lawyers in Washington, London and Tokyo and started running out of cash because I spent over \u00a31m on lawyers in 12 weeks.\" He has since received \u00a310m from the company. Woodford dismisses the idea that many will not speak out against wrongdoing because of a \"climate of fear\". He describes it as \"a nice tidy expression\", but adds: \"If you're working in a corporation, do you feel less fearful than you would have 20 years ago? Because of employment tribunals and because of the legislative framework \u2026 I don't think it's as bad compared to when I started working.\" Woodford is equally forthright on the issue of wilful ignorance at the top of organisations. \"If you're a senior officer of an institution in the public or private sector a different set of rules apply: you've got fiduciary duties to manage in a way that's protective of stakeholders' interests,\" he says. \"I think moving from paying big fines to [making] officers liable to custodial sentences would be a good thing. There is this feeling \u2026 people [are] turning a blind eye or not exploring.\"",

      "body": "<p>Michael Woodford, the former Olympus president turned whistleblower, has attacked the decision of the Competition Commission not to seek automatic rotation of company auditors.</p> <p>Woodford, who sounded the alarm in 2011 over a \u00a31.1bn fraud at the Japanese camera and optical instruments company, says a mandatory change is needed to prevent similar scandals at other companies.</p> <p>In his book Exposure: Inside the Olympus Scandal, Woodford revealed how the close relationship between Olympus and its audit firm KPMG over many years had reduced the likelihood of fraud coming come to light.</p> <p>\"You should rotate every 10 years,\" he told the Guardian. \"You should let people know there's going to be another partner coming in and it would lead to more conservatism. So I believe in compulsory rotation of auditors.\"</p> <p>Woodford, a leading witness in a Serious Fraud Office prosecution of Olympus and its UK subsidiary, Gyrus, which started last month, dismisses fears that large companies will not be able to move their audit work between the Big Four of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, EY and KPMG. \"I don't agree with the opinion that there will be problems finding another capable auditor. Some companies are deliberately changing their auditors, to demonstrate good governance.</p> <p>\"I disagree with the decision because four is better than one, and if you allow an auditing relationship to go year after year, common sense tells you that cannot be ideal. You get a degree of comfort by working with the same people, and ultimately with both parties endorsing a decision which other people may take a view on. There's a huge amount of lobbying against it by the auditing practices, saying it would cost whatever.\"</p> <p>The commission has said there should be a compulsory tender of the audit every 10 years, but no obligation for the auditor to change, despite a call from leading shareholders for a mandatory rotation. Instead, the commission called for more audit work to be overseen by the Financial Reporting Council or the government, more nuanced audit reports and an expanded role for audit committees.</p> <p>Woodford, who has maintained a vigorous media profile since he was fired by Olympus soon after he spoke out, is also calling for better protection for whistleblowers. Having joined the Commission on Whistleblowing set up by charity Public Concern at Work, he says: \"You may need legislation or a code of practice, requiring corporations to show they have whistleblowing lines. It would mean you could set up a whistleblowing line where it reports externally to a law firm or the best person internally, such as the chairman of the audit committee, or the chairman.\"</p> <p>An effective whistleblowing line should be separated from the executive of an organisation, says Woodford. What shaped his experience was the determination of the Olympus directors at first to deny the fraud existed before firing him and launching an aggressive public campaign to discredit him. \"You should filter out minor complaints, but if you have a serious issue where you think criminality may have been perpetrated, or an issue that is wholly against the public interest \u2026 and you feel uncomfortable raising it with your line report, then you should do this.\"</p> <p>Woodford says that the greatest hurdle for whistleblowers is often the fear of being victimised. \"If you're making allegations and it's criminal, then at some point you cannot remain anonymous, and this is why companies are uncomfortable, because it creates the situation of what do I do with this person?\"</p> <p>Woodford recognises that he was in a better position than many whistleblowers because he was in the most senior position at Olympus. \"It also helped that the amounts were large, so it was newsworthy and I could get the focus of the world's media on this issue,\" he adds.</p> <p>But at the beginning, few in the media would take him seriously, especially in Japan. \"It's easy in retrospect, but in those months the story seemed so extraordinary and journalists were very careful and very cautious and the Japanese media was acting like the press office of Olympus.

To be sure, a complete shutdown of the country would have an impact on national output, as was illustrated by the blizzards in December 2010. They had a material impact on gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of that year because the disruption was widespread and protracted. But that's not going to be the case this time. Firstly, the storm passed quickly and the Met Office gave plenty of warning that the bad weather was coming so people planned to work from home. Secondly, many workers were off anyway because of school half-term holidays. Thirdly, many of those who had an unexpected day off will have spent money in shops and restaurants. Finally, the fact that the bad weather came in October \u2013 the first month of the fourth quarter of 2013 \u2013 means there will be plenty of time to make up for lost output. There will have been some loss of output as a result of the bad weather, but at the most it will have shaved 0.1 points off GDP in the fourth quarter, and probably less than that. Two other factors are likely to have a bigger impact. The first is the slowdown in the global economy, with the political impasse in the United States and the weaker growth in India and China putting the brake on export growth. The second is evidence from the CBI's distributive trades survey that consumers paused for breath in October after spending freely in the previous three months. With real incomes under pressure due to prices rising more rapidly than wages, it was to be expected that households would at some point exercise some caution. Consumers are probably holding back now in order to be able to have a splurge at Christmas. But at this early stage, growth may struggle to match the 0.8% expansion seen in the third quarter.",

However, this is not as bad as it seems with the unseasonably warm weather likely having played a strong role. Indeed, retailers remain upbeat with more orders being placed with suppliers and anticipated sales for November looking strong. October has been far warmer than usual and as such demand for Autumn/winter clothing has been very weak. As temperatures drop we should see demand for these items strengthen. In any case consumer confidence continues to strengthen while the pick-up in the housing market appears to be supporting furniture and carpet sales which apparently did well in October according to the report.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>&#xa0;Richard Lowe at Barclays </strong>thinks retailers can expect a good Christmas:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While today\u2019s results appear modest when compared to the previous months of growth, this should be viewed as a blip rather than a major concern. The high street will now be firmly focused on Christmas, the single most important time in the trading calendar. Following a good Christmas last year, retailers are expecting another success.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight&#xa0;</strong>suggests that GDP growth could slow down.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The October CBI distributive trades survey indicates that&#xa0;consumers are taking at least a temporary breather in their spending after spending at a robust rate during the third quarter.The survey fuels suspicion that GDP growth is likely to moderate in the fourth quarter from the robust 0.8% quarter-on-quarter expansion seen in the third quarter.With purchasing power currently being limited by consumer price inflation running well above earnings growth, it is likely that many people are feeling the need to rein in their spending at least temporarily, particularly if they want to build up their funds for spending over the Christmas period.</p> <p>The key question is whether this is just consumers taking a breather before Christmas or the beginning of a significant period of consumer retrenchment? Retailers themselves seem to believe it is a temporary blip in consumer spending as a relatively healthy balance of +23% expect sales to be up year-on-year in November.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GrahamtRuddick/statuses/394784458206748673\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Retail sales data from CBI suggests recovery stalled. +2pc of retailers reported rise in sales last month, way below expectations of +31pc</p>&mdash; Graham Ruddick (@GrahamtRuddick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrahamtRuddick/statuses/394784458206748673\">October 28, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/statuses/394789889545228288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>CBI Retail sales survey comes in at +2, way below +33 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and +34 recorded in September - just a blip?</p>&mdash; Danny Blanchflower (@D_Blanchflower) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/statuses/394789889545228288\">October 28, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T11:44:35.606Z\">at 11.44am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-526e453ee4b0ac030bfe3a14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T11:14:56.200Z\">11.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">High street sales weaken</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After Friday's growth numbers showing that the UK economy was picking up speed, another set of figures suggest that high street sales lost momentum in October.</p> <p>From Katie Allen</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Retail sales growth this month was much weaker than the City had been expecting, according to the latest sector survey from the CBI.<br>The business group says the main balance on its report came in at +2, way below +33 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and +34 recorded in September.<br>The balance, which is the difference between the percentage of retailers reporting an increase and those reporting a decrease, was the weakest since June and breaks a three-month run of strong sales growth.<br>The CBI said grocers were among the worst affected.&#xa0;<br>Orders growth, however, held up in October and orders are expected to rise modestly again next month, it added.<br><strong>Barry Williams, from Asda and chair of the CBI\u2019s survey panel</strong>, said:<br>\u201cAlthough the high street recovery stalled this month, there is optimism that it was just a blip on the previous run of three months\u2019 growth.<br>\u201cRetailers expect sales to pick up next month and are upping orders with their suppliers.<br>\u201cIt\u2019s also encouraging to see that signs are pointing towards increased consumer confidence - backed up by continuing growth in certain areas such as furniture and carpets; recreational goods; footwear and leather - all did particularly well in October.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>More details <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2013/10/high-street-sales-stall-but-growth-expected-to-return-cbi/\">here</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T11:15:45.074Z\">at 11.15am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-526e41f0e4b0714062679302\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T10:57:46.616Z\">10.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Competition for UK jobs eases</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A glimmer of good news for job seekers from the jobs website Adzuna this morning.

It reports that competition for jobs fell to two-year low in September, with 1.9 jobseekers per vacancy, down from 2.3 in September 2012.<br>The site says its total number of advertised UK job vacancies rose 3.3% year-on-year in September to 710,859, the highest in two years.<br>However, the site echoes other reports of the continuing squeeze on living standards. The average advertised salary was up 0.6% on August, but still down 0.3% year-on-year. It also says the outlook is tough for graduates, with more than 50 graduates competing for every entry level job, and graduate salaries down 3.4% year-on-year.<br>Andrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna, comments: \u201cThe labour market is turning a corner... employers are opening up new vacancies, as they invest in more staff to meet growing demand, fuelled by increased consumer spending. This has had a knock-on effect for job hunters. The relentless competition for new vacancies is beginning to ease, and there are more roles to choose from.\u201d<br>The job site says its data suggests there is still very much a north-side divide in the UK jobs market.

Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow to cover all the latesst developments. European markets have had a relatively calm day despite the stormy weather outside. Investors are sitting on their hands ahead of this week's US Federal Reserve meeting. Economists believe the Fed is likely to keep its $85bn a month bond buying programme on track, but they will be looking out for any hints about an end to the QE which has supported markets for months. Most observers believe that after the recent US government shutdown and some indifferent economic data, there will be no tapering this year. Here are the closing scores: \u2022 The FTSE 100 edged up 4.48 points or 0.07% at 6725.82 \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.03% at 8983.12 \u2022 France's Cac has closed 0.38% lower at 4256.23 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB finished 0.24% lower at 18,829.42 \u2022 Spain's Ibex is off 0.81% at 9736.2 Meanwhile on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.02% or 3.8 points. Greece, Portugal and Spain will all achieve modest economic growth next year, according to a Reuters poll of 31 economists, but this will do little to make up for recent declines or their double digit unemployment rates. The survey said that apart from Greece, government efforts to cut their budget deficits would proceed more slowly than the IMF expected in this month's world economic outlook. Reuters said the survey forecasts were broadly in line with the last poll in August. Stevie Deans, the Unite union official at the centre of the Grangemouth dispute, has resigned from his job at the plant. PA reports: Deans was investigated by the company following his involvement in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in the Falkirk constituency. Grangemouth owner Ineos said in a statement: \"The company has conducted a thorough investigation into Mr Deans' activities over the last 18 months and made Mr Deans aware of these findings last week. \"Mr Deans requested an additional five days prior to the final disciplinary hearing to allow him time to provide any further relevant information. \"The company was due to meet with Mr Deans again tomorrow but has now received his resignation.\" Ineos threatened to close the petrochemical side of the business but changed its mind after the Unite union accepted changes to pay, pensions and other terms and conditions. Here are more details on the comments made by the Bank of England's David Miles. He warned that a rapid rise in interest rates before unemployment had fallen by a meaningful amount would damage the UK economy. Speaking in a BBC radio interview he said (quote courtesy Reuters): What we're going to do is not to increase interest rates...as soon as we get a little bit of good news on the economy, such as we've had over the last six months, because I think that would be a pretty catastrophic strategy. Miles, a dovish element on the Bank's monetary policy committee, said the impact of the storm on fourth quarter GDP would probably only be a \"blip.\" More from the Bank of England, this time David Miles: Still with Ireland, the Trokia of lenders (the European Commission, IMF and European Central Bank) has issued its latest report after July's visit to Dublin. It said: The mission found that programme implementation remains robust overall, even though domestic vulnerabilities and external risks remain important and will require on-going commitment from the authorities to reforms under the programme and beyond. The most important challenges highlighted concern the large government deficit and high public debt, the substantial level of non-performing loans on banks' balance sheets and the high level of unemployment. The document contains the updated programme documents in the annex. The completion of the 11th review prepares the release of \u20ac2.3bn from the EFSF, \u20ac0.8bn from the IMF, and a combined \u20ac0.25bn from Sweden and Denmark. This will bring the total amount authorised for disbursement under the programme to 97.9% of the overall international assistance of \u20ac67.5bn. The full report is available here. Willie Walsh looks like he might be getting even busier. The chief executive of British Airways and Iberia owner International Airlines Group is set to be named as chairman of Ireland's debt management agency. According to Reuters: \"Willie Walsh is an ideal candidate for the role... given his position as a global business leader, his extensive experience of corporate change, and his equity and financial market experience,\" Finance Minister Michael Noonan said in a statement. Ireland, due to complete an \u20ac85bn bailout in December, has decided not to issue any more bonds this year as it has enough cash on hand. An IAG spokeswoman told Reuters the appointment would have no impact on his role at the company. More quantitative easing talk from the Bank of England: In truth Spencer Dale, who is the Bank's chief economist, had suggested this as a possibility a couple of weeks ago, conversely also raising the prospect that interest rates might rise sooner than expected. Larry Elliott's story from the time is here: Interest rates may rise next year, says Bank of England chief economist Dale was speaking today at an invitation-only book launch for policy website Vox EU. Another poor set of figures from the US. The Dallas Fed manufacturing index of general business activity came in at 3.6 in October, compared to 12.8 the previous month and expectations of around 10. Another data surprise from the U.S: the index of pending home sales fell 5.6% in September, a much bigger drop than economists had forecast, far exceeding the 1.6% decrease recorded in August. According to Bloomberg, this is the biggest drop for three years. With a government shutdown in full swing, people decided it was not a good time to be moving house... With that I'm passing over to Nick Fletcher... Thanks for all your comments so far. JR Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup president, has warned that Spanish banks still need close monitoring. Dijsselbloem is looking at the conditions under which the EU bailout fund will inject capital direct to banks. Here is what he told the Dutch Parliament about Spain, via snaps from Reuters RTRS - EUROGROUP'S DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS SPANISH BANKING SECTOR STILL NEEDS CLOSE MONITORING RTRS - EUROGROUP HEAD DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS SPANISH RECOVERY ON TRACK BUT WEAK ECONOMY IS PRESSURING BANKS Traders on Wall Street seem to have given a collective yawn to the U.S industrial output data (13.24) - the markets have hardly moved. Dow Jones: down 0.1% at 15,554 points S&amp;P500: down 0.02% at 1,759 points Nasdaq:down 0.02% at 3,942 points Here is a breakdown of the Federal Reserve U.S industrial production data Manufacturing production was up 0.1%, after a 0.5% fall in August. Mining was up 0.2%, while utilities shot up 4.4% after five months of decline. This was another tranche of data that was delayed during the U.S government shutdown. You can read the Federal Reserve summary here Hot from the wires, U.S industrial production recorded its largest increase in 7 months in September, exceeding economists' expectations. Industrial output rose 0.6% in September, ahead of the 0.4% that economists polled by Reuters had forecast. Many jobs created in the last few years are temporary, part-time, or the result of people opting to be their own boss. This appears to be the conclusion of the Office for National Statistics - and the upshot of a dispute over statistics between the ONS and Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Williamson thinks that the ONS has overstated employment growth in the private sector for the last three years. He says: \"Business survey data points to far weaker job creation than suggested by the Office for National Statistics over the past three years. The data go some way to explain the 'productivity puzzle' and brings productivity growth more closely into line with that experienced by the UK's peers.\" This blog by Katie Allen on the productivity puzzle recaps Markit's argument in full. Now the ONS has issued a defence of its data. However, having looked carefully at it, and without knowing the full details of the methods involved in the production of the report\u2019s figures, our initial view is that the report does not bring into question the accuracy of the official employment figures, based on the Labour Force Survey (LFS). Official speak, for 'we still think we are right'. But more interesting is the ONS's analysis of where the growth in the labour market has come from, which contrasts their survey with work done by Markit: First, our understanding is that the business surveys may not pick up in full some groups where employment has been growing rapidly in recent times. Some of these were referred to in the report but others may also be relevant. The ONS statistics contain the full effect of changes in the number of self-employed, temporary and part-time workers whereas it seems likely that the business surveys will do so only in part , if at all. (My highlights) The FTSE 100 index of leading shares is slightly down, losing early gains that saw it hit five-year highs. Continental markets are also down, including Germany's DAX, which hit a record high this morning. FTSE 100: -0.21% at 6,707 points CAC 40: -0.7% at 4,240 points DAX : -0.2% at 8,960 points IBEX33: -1% at 9,717 points Observers are putting the falls down to profit-taking, as investors seek to take their gains. David Jones at trading house IG sees a weather-related reason for thin volumes of trade in London this morning. It has been an unsurprisingly quiet session so far today with the FTSE barely able to muster a 20-point range. The pre-emptive action taken by various train companies ahead of the expected stormy weather has meant a somewhat deserted City of London this morning, and this is being reflected in volumes so far. The price of gold is hovering near five-week highs on lingering doubts about the health of the world economy. Spot gold was worth $1,348.44 in the early hours of Monday, after gaining almost 3% last week. The price of gold has dropped by almost 20% since the start of the year, but has been creeping back up again, as traders count on the Federal Reserve sticking to its stimulus plan - a sign that the health of global recovery is far from assured. Cash registers on the high street were ringing out less often in September (see 11.14), but economists seem unconcerned. James Knightley at ING Bank blames the warm weather for the dip in sales: The UK\u2019s CBI retail sales survey has collapsed in October with just a net 2% of retailers seeing higher sales on twelve months ago, down from a 15 month high of 34% in September. However, this is not as bad as it seems with the unseasonably warm weather likely having played a strong role. Indeed, retailers remain upbeat with more orders being placed with suppliers and anticipated sales for November looking strong. October has been far warmer than usual and as such demand for Autumn/winter clothing has been very weak. As temperatures drop we should see demand for these items strengthen. In any case consumer confidence continues to strengthen while the pick-up in the housing market appears to be supporting furniture and carpet sales which apparently did well in October according to the report. Richard Lowe at Barclays thinks retailers can expect a good Christmas: While today\u2019s results appear modest when compared to the previous months of growth, this should be viewed as a blip rather than a major concern. The high street will now be firmly focused on Christmas, the single most important time in the trading calendar. Following a good Christmas last year, retailers are expecting another success. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight suggests that GDP growth could slow down. The October CBI distributive trades survey indicates that consumers are taking at least a temporary breather in their spending after spending at a robust rate during the third quarter.The survey fuels suspicion that GDP growth is likely to moderate in the fourth quarter from the robust 0.8% quarter-on-quarter expansion seen in the third quarter.With purchasing power currently being limited by consumer price inflation running well above earnings growth, it is likely that many people are feeling the need to rein in their spending at least temporarily, particularly if they want to build up their funds for spending over the Christmas period. The key question is whether this is just consumers taking a breather before Christmas or the beginning of a significant period of consumer retrenchment? Retailers themselves seem to believe it is a temporary blip in consumer spending as a relatively healthy balance of +23% expect sales to be up year-on-year in November. After Friday's growth numbers showing that the UK economy was picking up speed, another set of figures suggest that high street sales lost momentum in October. From Katie Allen Retail sales growth this month was much weaker than the City had been expecting, according to the latest sector survey from the CBI. The business group says the main balance on its report came in at +2, way below +33 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and +34 recorded in September. The balance, which is the difference between the percentage of retailers reporting an increase and those reporting a decrease, was the weakest since June and breaks a three-month run of strong sales growth. The CBI said grocers were among the worst affected. Orders growth, however, held up in October and orders are expected to rise modestly again next month, it added. Barry Williams, from Asda and chair of the CBI\u2019s survey panel, said: \u201cAlthough the high street recovery stalled this month, there is optimism that it was just a blip on the previous run of three months\u2019 growth. \u201cRetailers expect sales to pick up next month and are upping orders with their suppliers. \u201cIt\u2019s also encouraging to see that signs are pointing towards increased consumer confidence - backed up by continuing growth in certain areas such as furniture and carpets; recreational goods; footwear and leather - all did particularly well in October.\u201d More details here A glimmer of good news for job seekers from the jobs website Adzuna this morning. Competition for vacancies in the UK has fallen to a two-year low, although it remains pretty tough, with more than 50 graduates chasing every entry-level position. The Guardian's economics reporter Katie Allen also points out that the squeeze on living standards continues. Here is her report: There is some upbeat news for jobseekers in the UK from the jobs website Adzuna this morning. It reports that competition for jobs fell to two-year low in September, with 1.9 jobseekers per vacancy, down from 2.3 in September 2012. The site says its total number of advertised UK job vacancies rose 3.3% year-on-year in September to 710,859, the highest in two years. However, the site echoes other reports of the continuing squeeze on living standards. The average advertised salary was up 0.6% on August, but still down 0.3% year-on-year. It also says the outlook is tough for graduates, with more than 50 graduates competing for every entry level job, and graduate salaries down 3.4% year-on-year. Andrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna, comments: \u201cThe labour market is turning a corner... employers are opening up new vacancies, as they invest in more staff to meet growing demand, fuelled by increased consumer spending. This has had a knock-on effect for job hunters. The relentless competition for new vacancies is beginning to ease, and there are more roles to choose from.\u201d The job site says its data suggests there is still very much a north-side divide in the UK jobs market. Nine of the top ten cities to find a job were in the South of England. Cambridge was the easiest place to find a job for the first time this month, with more than three advertised vacancies per jobseeker. In Salford there are 35.9 jobseekers per vacancy, in Sunderland there are 31.06 jobseekers per vacancy, and in Hull there are 25.36 jobseekers per vacancy, says Adzuna. Still, salaries in the North East of England have risen 1.7% year-on-year to \u00a328,083 p.a., the biggest increase of any UK region, it added. European markets are up, while Germany\u2019s DAX hit a record high this morning.The FTSE is flat, although Michael Hewson of CMC Markets is expecting one of the best October stock market performances in years, storm or no storm. The last time we had a massive storm in October in 1987, the stock market dropped sharply. While one could speculate as to whether history could repeat itself, it seems unlikely when you have the Federal Reserve sitting in the background, and it is the Fed which is likely to be the focus of attention this week. We have retail sales figures from the CBI at 11am. I\u2019ll be following all the latest throughout the day Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Like the trains and the buses in the south east of the UK, a delayed start to the liveblog this morning, but now we are up and running. No one story is dominating the business news agenda, so once again we are watching the U.S Federal Reserve and its massive bond-buying programme. With Fed officials starting their two-day meeting tomorrow, the consensus is that they are unlikely to announce a shift in monetary policy.",

At an annual conference for American hotel owners, InterContinental said third quarter US revenue per available room rose 3.5% but the September figure was just 1.6%, due to the timing of certain holidays. It said current trading gave it confidence for the rest of the year. Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> Third quarter trading is a bit below expectations with Americas revenue per available room up 3.7% and within that US 3.5%. However September was weak at 2.1% in Americas and within that the US 1.6%. The culprit was Holiday Inn which was down 0.9% reflecting slower group business. Current trading trends give the group confidence for the rest of the year but we think revenue expectations may edge back a bit for the fourth quarter in both Americas and Greater China. Consensus forecasts are for $660m earnings before interest and tax and we think these may edge back. We reiterate our hold recommendation. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 4.48 points higher at 6725.82, but volumes were thin thanks to the combined effects of travel disruption thanks to the stormy weather and the half term break. Investors were also reluctant to dip into the market ahead of this week's US Federal Reserve meeting, with the central bank widely expected to maintain its $85bn a month bond buying programme. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote> It is difficult to draw too many conclusions from such a disjointed day of trading, with the City's desks only half full for most of the day, but you suspect this will not be the case tomorrow. Tomorrow should offer traders the ability to chew through the after-market Apple figures and the sizable impact they will play on the Nasdaq and US investor sentiment. <br> Closer to home we will also see exactly where Lloyds stand after the inevitable political rhetoric over its demise and subsequent re-emergence from under the government's wing. In mainland Europe we have the reporting figures of UBS and Deutsche Bank to look forward to. </blockquote> <p><strong>Aggreko</strong> was the day's biggest riser in the leading index, up 91p at \u00a316.08 after the temporary power supply group said three month trading had been in line with expectations. Its local business should see revenues and margins ahead of the previous year, but power projects slightly lower. Traders said short sellers were being squeezed by the positive statement.</p> <p>Insurers seemed relatively unfazed by the overnight storms, with <strong>RSA Insurance</strong> up 0.4p at 127.24p, <strong>Legal and General</strong> losing just 0.9p to 212p and <strong>Aviva</strong> off 2.8p at 435.8p. Hari Sivakumaran at Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> It very early to say what the financial impact of the storm will be for UK insurers. We would note that the storm had been forecast well in advance and that preparations had been made prior to its arrival, which we expect will limit the potential damage it inflicts. <br> We would be surprised if the storm added more than 1-2 points to combined operating ratios. If significant flooding were to arise then we would expect the cost to become greater.  Year to date the UK weather losses have been benign and we expect will be contained within adverse weather budgets.  UK insurers likely to be impacted are Aviva, Direct Line, esure, Legal &amp; General and RSA. </blockquote> <p>Security group <strong>G4S </strong>ended 1.3p lower at 257.2p after it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/28/g4s-rejects-charterhouse-offer-cash-transportation-arm\" title=\"\">rejected a \u00a31.55bn bid from private equity group Charterhouse for its cash solutions business</a>.</p> <p>Retail shares were mixed after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/28/uk-retailers-sharp-slowdown-sales-cbi\" title=\"\">a surprisingly weak high street survey for October from the CBI</a>, where main sales balance came in at +2, down sharply from September's +34 and much lower than the +33 forecast. Many analysts said the result could be a blip, due to warmer than usual weather during the month hitting autumn clothing sales. Despite hopes of a pickup in sales in the run-up to Christmas, <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer </strong>slipped 0.8p to 475p but <strong>Next</strong> added 10p to \u00a352.15 and <strong>Dixons Retail </strong>rose 0.69p to 48.03p.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Shire</strong> rose 38p to \u00a328.14 as analysts issued positive recommendations in the wake of last week's trading update. In a buy note Goldman Sachs said:</p> <blockquote> Post Shire's strong third quarter and earnings upgrade, we revise our Shire earnings per share estimates for 2013 by around 3% and 2014-2018 by 7%-10%. Our new estimates now imply a five year (2012-17) earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 16.5% versus 14%. Importantly, we continue to view Shire as a top line growth story, with revenue forecast to grow around 6% over the next five years on an organic basis. Consequently, despite the [recent] 9% share price move, we still view Shire as being significantly under valued in the context of its growth outlook. We believe consensus estimates do not reflect any optionality on Shire's ability to add to its robust organic growth outlook via M&amp;A, business development. <br> </blockquote> <p>Citigroup was also upbeat, raising its target price from \u00a329 to \u00a332, although it did add:</p> <blockquote> With no near-term uptick in [skin substitute] Dermagraft revenues evident, we wonder why Shire does not divest this asset, or even stop manufacture and promotion of the product altogether.

Overall the FTSE 100 finished 4.48 points higher at 6725.82, but volumes were thin thanks to the combined effects of travel disruption thanks to the stormy weather and the half term break. Investors were also reluctant to dip into the market ahead of this week's US Federal Reserve meeting, with the central bank widely expected to maintain its $85bn a month bond buying programme. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said: It is difficult to draw too many conclusions from such a disjointed day of trading, with the City's desks only half full for most of the day, but you suspect this will not be the case tomorrow. Tomorrow should offer traders the ability to chew through the after-market Apple figures and the sizable impact they will play on the Nasdaq and US investor sentiment. Closer to home we will also see exactly where Lloyds stand after the inevitable political rhetoric over its demise and subsequent re-emergence from under the government's wing. In mainland Europe we have the reporting figures of UBS and Deutsche Bank to look forward to. Aggreko was the day's biggest riser in the leading index, up 91p at \u00a316.08 after the temporary power supply group said three month trading had been in line with expectations. Its local business should see revenues and margins ahead of the previous year, but power projects slightly lower. Traders said short sellers were being squeezed by the positive statement. Insurers seemed relatively unfazed by the overnight storms, with RSA Insurance up 0.4p at 127.24p, Legal and General losing just 0.9p to 212p and Aviva off 2.8p at 435.8p. Hari Sivakumaran at Oriel Securities said: It very early to say what the financial impact of the storm will be for UK insurers. We would note that the storm had been forecast well in advance and that preparations had been made prior to its arrival, which we expect will limit the potential damage it inflicts. We would be surprised if the storm added more than 1-2 points to combined operating ratios. If significant flooding were to arise then we would expect the cost to become greater. Year to date the UK weather losses have been benign and we expect will be contained within adverse weather budgets. UK insurers likely to be impacted are Aviva, Direct Line, esure, Legal &amp; General and RSA. Security group G4S ended 1.3p lower at 257.2p after it rejected a \u00a31.55bn bid from private equity group Charterhouse for its cash solutions business. Retail shares were mixed after a surprisingly weak high street survey for October from the CBI, where main sales balance came in at +2, down sharply from September's +34 and much lower than the +33 forecast. Many analysts said the result could be a blip, due to warmer than usual weather during the month hitting autumn clothing sales. Despite hopes of a pickup in sales in the run-up to Christmas, Marks &amp; Spencer slipped 0.8p to 475p but Next added 10p to \u00a352.15 and Dixons Retail rose 0.69p to 48.03p. Elsewhere Shire rose 38p to \u00a328.14 as analysts issued positive recommendations in the wake of last week's trading update. In a buy note Goldman Sachs said: Post Shire's strong third quarter and earnings upgrade, we revise our Shire earnings per share estimates for 2013 by around 3% and 2014-2018 by 7%-10%. Our new estimates now imply a five year (2012-17) earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 16.5% versus 14%. Importantly, we continue to view Shire as a top line growth story, with revenue forecast to grow around 6% over the next five years on an organic basis. Consequently, despite the [recent] 9% share price move, we still view Shire as being significantly under valued in the context of its growth outlook. We believe consensus estimates do not reflect any optionality on Shire's ability to add to its robust organic growth outlook via M&amp;A, business development. Citigroup was also upbeat, raising its target price from \u00a329 to \u00a332, although it did add: With no near-term uptick in [skin substitute] Dermagraft revenues evident, we wonder why Shire does not divest this asset, or even stop manufacture and promotion of the product altogether. The regenerative medicines division lost around $90mn the first half of 2013, with additional losses recorded in third quarter. Dermagraft sales declined by around 50% in the first nine months of 2013. But Vodafone fell 1.25p to 225.5p after Michael Clark of income fund Fidelity MoneyBuilder sold its stake in the mobile phone group. Tullow Oil slid 21.5p to 957p after it temporarily suspended drilling operations in northern Kenya following demonstrations by local communities regarding concerns around employment in Turkana county. Cairn Energy closed 2.1p lower at 278.9p as it agreed with US group Kosmos Energy and the Moroccan National Oil Company to take a 20% stake in an exploration block in the Atlantic. Drilling on the Cap Boujdour site off Morocco is due to start in the second half of 2014. Finally Royal Mail fell 8.5p to 546.5p.",

The offer comes as the company attempts to rebuild its reputation following the London Olympics security shambles, when it failed to provide sufficient numbers of staff to guard the Games. Former G4S chief executive Nick Buckles survived the initial fallout from the Olympics contract, which ultimately cost G4S \u00a388m, but quit in May in the wake of a profit warning. He had worked at the company for 28 years, and left with a total financial package of around \u00a316m, including pension and shares. G4S, along with rival Serco, was also accused earlier in the year of overcharging the taxpayer for electronically tagging criminals who were dead, in prison or never tagged in the first place. News of the approach from Charterhouse came as it emerged a South African prison run by G4S was under investigation for allegedly using forced injections and electric shock treatment to subdue inmates. The latest allegations relating to Mangaung Correctional Centre near Bloemfontein follow a year-long investigation by the Wits Justice Project, part of the University of Witwatersrand journalism department.

In particular, we believe that the UK cash business will start to improve due to the turnaround strategy enacted this year and the whole of the cash division will benefit as interest rates rise, so G4S could be selling at the bottom of the cycle.\" New chief executive Ashley Almanza, who joined G4S as chief financial officer just three weeks before Buckles' departure was announced, said in August the company would divest a number of non-core businesses. He said the company was working on systems and processes to improve efficiency and risk management, and would be restructuring a number of businesses to make them more competitive and able to deliver improved margins. G4S had a turnover of around \u00a37.3bn in 2012, excluding the Olympics contract, with operations in more than 120 countries and more than 620,000 staff. The biggest part of the group is the provision of security solutions, including manned security for companies, which accounted for 59% of turnover in 2012. Government secure solutions, including work in the care and justice sectors and border protection, is the second largest part of the group at 23% of turnover in 2012, followed by cash solutions at 18%. Charterhouse did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Retailers suffered a sharp slowdown in sales this month, according to an industry survey that has cast doubt on the pace of the wider UK economic recovery. After a strong run of growth, sales ground to a halt at the start of October and came in well below City forecasts, the CBI business group said. The main sales balance in its monthly survey came in at +2, down sharply from +34 recorded in September and much lower than +33 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. The balance, which is the difference between the percentage of retailers reporting an increase and those reporting a decrease in sales, was the weakest since June and breaks a three-month run of strong sales growth. Some economists said the slowdown underlined the pressures on households as lacklustre pay growth fails to match rises in living costs. If consumer demand remains weak, economic growth in the final three months of the year may fail to match the 0.8% reported for the third quarter in official figures last week. But the CBI and other analysts said there were signs sales would soon bounce back. In particular, the business group emphasised that a majority of retailers were placing bigger orders with their suppliers. Barry Williams, from Asda and chair of the CBI's survey panel, said: \"Although the high street recovery stalled this month, there is optimism that it was just a blip on the previous run of three months' growth. Retailers expect sales to pick up next month.\" For October, most sub-sectors saw sales growth slow, the CBI said. In particular, grocers saw the first year-on-year fall in sales volumes in eight months but there were some areas that enjoyed stronger trade. \"Signs are pointing towards increased consumer confidence \u2013 backed up by continuing growth in certain areas such as furniture and carpets; recreational goods; footwear and leather \u2013 all did particularly well in October,\" added Williams. James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets suggested the surprise collapse in this month's sales balance was weather related. \"October has been far warmer than usual and as such demand for autumn/winter clothing has been very weak. As temperatures drop we should see demand for these items strengthen. In any case consumer confidence continues to strengthen while the pickup in the housing market appears to be supporting furniture and carpet sales,\" he said. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the survey underlined the pressure on consumers, who are \"taking at least a temporary breather\". \"The survey fuels suspicion that GDP growth is likely to moderate in the fourth quarter from the robust 0.8% quarter-on-quarter expansion seen in the third quarter. \"With purchasing power currently being limited by consumer price inflation running well above earnings growth, it is likely that many people are feeling the need to rein in their spending at least temporarily, particularly if they want to build up their funds for spending over the Christmas period.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Further evidence that confidence is returning to the housing market will emerge on Monday when a survey by the UK's biggest mortgage lender shows seven in 10 Britons expect house prices to rise in the coming months. The level is the highest registered by Halifax since it started its quarterly survey in 2011 and comes amid controversy about whether the chancellor's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme is creating conditions for a new bubble. A week ago, estate agent Rightmove found that house prices were rising fastest in London, where asking prices had risen by an average of 10%, while the rest of the UK recorded a 2.8% month on month rise. Halifax found that in September in a number of English regions more people thought it was a good time to sell than regarded it as a bad time to sell. Those regions included the south-east, east, south-west, north-east and West Midlands, as well as London. In June, the last time the survey was carried out, most respondents in all regions thought it a bad time to sell. Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said regional disparities still existed, with people in Scotland, the north-west and the east Midlands the least positive about the prospects of selling in the next 12 months. Across the country, fewer than 50% of people surveyed thought it a good time to sell, and many more saw it as a good time to buy. \"The significant improvement in sentiment towards selling a home could help to boost the supply of properties available for sale on the market, which will help ease any upwards pressure on house prices. It could also help to increase levels of housing market activity from their still historically low levels,\" said Ellis. The Halifax study coincided with the latest survey from housing analyst Hometrack, where director of research Richard Donnell dismissed talk of a housing bubble. \"Talk of a national housing bubble is overdone but any weakening in demand, against the backdrop of tight supply, will result in a slowdown in house price growth,\" he said. Sale prices showed a steady but unspectacular 0.5% increase in October after the same rise in September, said Hometrack. Donnell said a frenzy of activity in London and fears that prices will soar \"could start to impact on market sentiment and the willingness of buyers to pay higher prices\". Asking prices tracked by Rightmove have often outstripped final selling prices and, according to some critics, exaggerate the extent of house price inflation, at least in the short term. Policymakers at the Treasury and the Bank of England are known to be relaxed about the claims that a house price bubble is developing, preferring to believe that banks and other lenders will turn down mortgage applications that are unsustainable and likely to result in repossession should there be another crash. Adding to the sense that London is a special case, some analysts have stressed that a majority of purchases in the capital involve overseas investors, cash buyers or corporate interests without recourse to a mortgage loan. Hometrack said that without a steep rise in housebuilding, the market would continue to tighten and push up prices. The supply of homes for sale fell by 1.6% in October following a 0.3% decline in September. It said the proportion of asking prices being achieved rose to 95.2%, close to the all-time high of 95.7% seen in June 2007. Donnellsaid: \"A chronic lack of supply is driving price growth. Longer sales periods are likely to be a combination of a reducing quality in the stock of homes for sale and increasing buyer sensitivity in the face of strong price rises and widespread debate over a housing bubble\".",

      "bodyText": "Just one in eight top roles in the City are held by women, according to a new survey which found that those women who do reach senior positions are in jobs that are traditionally lower paid. The survey, by recruitment firm Astbury Marsden, found that while the number of women at managing director level had doubled in a year, only 12% of these positions just outside the boardroom were held by women. The company found that the overall percentage of women working in the City was now 20% compared with 18% in 2012. But the survey noted that women tended to have non-client facing, non-fee earning jobs, such as human resources \u2013 where women hold 60% of the roles \u2013 and internal audit. In the roles offering bigger pay cheques, such as corporate broking and private equity, women hold 19% and 25% of the jobs respectively, according to the survey. Mark Cameron, chief operating officer at Astbury Marsden, said the research showed that women were reaching higher levels of seniority. \"However, there is also the question as to why the women have a much lower overall representation in some of the higher paid areas of financial services such as positions in corporate broking and stockbroking or positions in private equity,\" Cameron said.",
