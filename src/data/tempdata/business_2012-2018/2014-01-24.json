      "bodyText": "A series of political scandals and accusations of mismanagement in some of the world's major developing economies triggered turmoil on international stock exchanges on Friday. The FTSE 100 fell more than 100 points, or 1.6%, and the US Dow Jones dropped 1.2% as traders reacted to concerns that Argentina, Turkey, South Africa and several vulnerable Central American nations might be on the brink of a currency crisis. Political instability in Ukraine and the nose-diving Venezuelan economy added to the nervous atmosphere on exchanges, which have spent the last few weeks galloping ahead on the back of stronger growth forecasts in the US, UK and Japan. Central banks waded into the markets in an effort to stabilise currencies that were rapidly depreciating in an emerging markets selloff. In the wake of the collapse of the Argentine peso, which kickstarted the latest wave of selling, the Turkish lira hit record lows despite spending an estimated \u00a31bn to prop up the currency's value during the day. The rouble and the rand languished at levels not seen since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Some analysts blamed profligate government spending and corruption for the turmoil affecting some countries. Turkey is in the grip of a corruption investigation that has come close to the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while Ukraine's president, Viktor Yanukovych, is facing violent protests that have spread from the capital, Kiev. Others blamed weakening demand for raw materials as the Chinese economy slows. The US recovery, which will attract investor funds previously parked in developing countries to earn a bigger return, is another destabilising factor. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \"European markets fell flat on their faces as the emerging market currency rout continued, with the Argentine peso, Indian rupee, Turkish lira and South African rand all among the worst decliners, as economic growth concerns start to spread beyond China. \"With expectations rising that the Fed will continue to taper [quantitative easing] next week, de-risking is continuing to see capital flow into safer havens with gold, the Japanese yen and the US dollar the main gainers,\" he said. In Turkey, the central bank has refused to raise interest rates, even though the lira has fallen almost 9% this month, raising fears of mounting inflation and an exodus of investors. Despite a fire sale of about $1.65bn (\u00a31bn) to calm investors' nerves, a move that removed almost a 10th of its reserves, the lira dropped almost 2%. RBS analysts said: \"The [Turkish central bank] simply does not have enough firepower to fight the pressure against the lira. It has now exhausted its 'no hike' toolkit and its next major policy action will have to be a straightforward increase in the lending rate.\" The lira is only one of many currencies feeling the heat from investor worries. Central banks believed to have intervened to defend their currencies include India, Taiwan and Malaysia. Russia propped up the rouble after $350m in hard currency sales. Countries that have relied on huge inflows of investor funds over recent years also suffered in the jittery atmosphere. The rupee, the Brazilian real, the rouble and the rand all fell by more than 1% against the dollar. The Russian currency also hit a record low to the euro. Investors have withdrawn about $4bn from emerging market stock exchanges so far this year. Argentina's peso saw its worst one-day trading session since the country's 2002 financial crisis. The central bank said it had decided to loosen strict foreign exchange controls, abandoning its long-standing policy of supporting the currency through interventions.",

The Bank of England governor indicated to Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight that interest rates wouldn't rise in the near future, despite unemployment falling to near the BoE's 7% threshold for considering a rise.</p> <p>Carney is giving a speech at Davos just after midday. He seems to have stolen his own thunder by going on the telly the night before but let's see what he says.</p> <p>Here's what CMC Markets' Michael Hewson makes of Carney's interview:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last night\u2019s comments shouldn\u2019t really have been a surprise given&#xa0;comments he made in November last year \u201cone could imagine a scenario where the unemployment threshold is reached and that the best policy for the MPC at that period of time is to keep rates at current levels because the trade-off between output and inflation is attractive,\u201d he said. With inflation now at 2% the Bank is clearly playing that trade-off.</p> </blockquote> <p>Away from the glamour of Davos,&#xa0;<b>Martin Weale</b>, an external member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, has been checking out the local economy in Suffolk.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.eadt.co.uk/business/suffolk_no_early_rise_in_interest_rates_on_the_cards_says_mpc_member_martin_weale_1_3237989\">The East Anglian Daily Times reports</a>&#xa0;that Weale, who voted against Carney's forward guidance plan, doesn't want the MPC to revise its criteria for considering a rate rise. There are no quotes from Weale in the story but this is what the paper reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\ufeffThere have been suggestions the MPC should now lower the 7% threshold to, perhaps, 6.5%, but Mr Weale said he did not believe this would achieve the core aim of Forward Guidance, that of creating greater certainty, as any new threshold could also quickly be overtaken by events.&#xa0;However, he said the MPC had been clear all along that the unemployment rate was only one of many factors which would shape any decision to raise interest rates and, with wage increases still well below inflation, there was scope for rates to remain at their current level for a while yet.</p> </blockquote> <p>Interesting stuff, especially after Carney's interview and fellow MPC member&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/23/interest-rate-rise-undermine-recovery-mpc-paul-fisherhttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/23/interest-rate-rise-bank-of-england\">Paul Fisher's speech yesterday</a>&#xa0;when he said he couldn't see an \"immediate need\" to increase rates.

Consumer volumes fell as people held off posting big items made more expensive by the size-based pricing.</p> <p>Here's what chief executive Moya Greene said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We remained the nation's number one parcel delivery company, handling 115 million parcels in the month of December alone. That's significantly more than any other carrier in the UK parcel market.

      "bodyText": "And that's all for tonight from us - thanks for reading and commenting (always appreciated). GW Earlier today, David Cameron was outlining the importance of the post 2015 development goals at Davos. Oxfam have just responded, criticising the goals for failing to include a target to cut inequality -- the key theme of this year's Davos. Emma Seery, Oxfam senior policy adviser, said: \"We welcome the PM's push for global goals to tackle corruption and promote democracy. But this week's Davos discussions have revealed the absence of a target to reduce inequality to be a gaping hole at the heart of the current post-2015 proposal.\" Draghi's final comment on the eurozone stress tests might send a shiver through weaker banks -- \ufeff\"Shedding light on banks' balance sheets should help them raise capital in the market. And of course banks that should go, should go.\" Argentina's currency woes have reawakened fears of problems in emerging markets and sent investors scurrying for cover, writes Nick Fletcher. With stock markets at or near record highs, the news was enough to bring out the profit takers. So the closing scores were as follows: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 109.54 points or 1.62% lower at 6663.74, its worst week since June last year \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 2.48% at 9392.02 \u2022 France's Cac closed 2.79% lower at 4161.47 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 2.3% down at 19,358.99 \u2022 Spain's Ibex fell 3.64% to 9868.9 As for Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 188 points or 1.18%. Draghi continues that he does not have any expectations on the outcome of the Asset Quality Review -- but shedding light on their balance sheets should help them raise capital. A long question about Europe's banks, and the part that politics will play in the upcoming Asset Quality Review for the eurozone banking sector: Draghi: there has been a return of confidence into the banking sector. Banks have been issuing bonds in significant amounts for some months, and the difference between what financial firms and non-financial firms pay to borrow has contracted to zero. So, its a more confident environment. And once we announced the AQR, some regulators made sure banks would reclassify their loans as non-performing, and provisions against them, or raise capital, or deleverage. This situation is \"dramatically better than a year ago\". So why are we doing this, Draghi continues -- we need a monetary policy that lets us achieve our goal of price stability. High fragmentation in the eurozone banking sector (ie, banks in the periphery paying more for credit than in the core) makes that process harder, he explains. The AQR should further rebuild confidence. Germany is the only country with lower youth unemployment rate since the crisis started, and inflation is below your target of close to, but below 2% -- only seven have inflation at 1% or higher, says Hildebrand. You've said you stand ready to act, Mario -- could you tell us what parts of your arsenal would be most effective if you were called to fight low inflation? Draghi agrees that eurozone inflation is below target, and will remain below for some time. But he doesn't see deflation in the eurozone -- not defined as broad-based falls in prices across the eurozone. Medium-term inflation expectations are firmly anchored at 2%, he adds. And core inflation is being pulled down by the rates of the four 'programme countries' -- that is probably partly due to the internal rebalancing. In that case, it's a temporary effect. (this all sounds rather like an ECB press conference) Draghi is now arguing that countries did the easiest thing when they entered fiscal consolidation programmes under a crisis: namely raising taxes \"in a part of the world where taxes are already high\", with little progress on cutting government expenditure and huge cuts in capital expenditure. So now we have to make these fiscal consolidation programmes more growth-friendly - less taxes, less government expenditure, more expenditure on infrastructure. We should also give a medium-term perspective to this fiscal consolidation, which seems to have been successful as a way to go in the UK, for example, he adds. Draghi also cites youth unemployment as an example that labour markets must be reformed. Philipp Hildebrand says there has been tremendous readjustment in peripheral euro countries in recent years. But then he cites an OECD report into which countries have made the most reforms -- Germany comes last, while countries who have been through a reform programme are at the top. Is the crisis over in the periphery? And should we be worried that in two years there will be a crisis in the core? Draghi replies that Germany is last because it made these reforms 10 years ago. But all countries need structural reforms. Draghi agrees that countries such as Greece have made good progress on structural reforms. But other peripheral countries have not done as much. Also have some core countries who need to reform - that's not because they did it 10 years ago, but because they've not done it. No country is named -- but France (sick man or not) must be on the list. Draghi said European leaders also deserve credit for the eurozone recovery, citing the commitment taken in summer 2012 to develop banking union. I said something else in London (in the whatever it takes speech) that has not been well reported, he adds, that the markets were \"vastly underestimating the amount of political commitment\" that European countries has put into making the euro a success. The bottom line is this, says Mario Draghi: \ufeff We are seeing the beginning of a recovery that is still weak, still fragile, and still uneven. Still based on exports, but there are signs of a recovery in domestic demand. But unemployment is still far too high, and risks remain to the downside. Philipp Hildebrand of BlackRock, who is chairing the session, tells Draghi that Larry Summers recently compared him to Churchill: Never in the history of financial markets have so few words and even less action done so much for so many. Draghi agrees that stock prices have risen sharply since he pledged to do whatever it takes to save the euro, while bond yields (borrowing costs) have fallen. Risks have decreased all across the board, for core countries and those in the periphery, Draghi adds. And there are signs that the recovery is finally reaching the real economy, with encouraging surveys. But the hard data is not so good. Mario Draghi is being introduced at Davos now, as among the best experienced, best educated central bankers in the world. He has guided us through the biggest financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression, says Klaus Schwab. It's being streamed here. French finance minister has condemned \"foolish\" claims that France is now the sick man of Europe as \"caricature and prejudice\", insisting that Paris is determined to improve its economy. Pierre Moscovici told reporters at Davos that when he looks at the performances between Great Britain and France since 2008, \"I'd prefer to be French\". \ufeffWe are the same level of production [GDP] as in 2008 - it's not too great, but it's better than Great Britain. Moscovici added that while Great Britain appears to have a better dynamism today, that may be because \"the situation before was not so fine\", continuing: If being the sick man of Europe is being the 5th economy in the world, with GDP higher than Great Britain, the second economy in Europe, with capacities for education, for innovation, for investment, for creation, well, it's good to be sick. Moscovici said that \"I know that we have problems\", citing the need to create more jobs, fight unemployment, raise competitiveness and cut the public debt (which France's own state auditor fears is dangerously high at over 93% of GDP). adding: \ufeffBut I make a difference between bashing - bashing is the \"foolish idea\" that we are the sick man of Europe, that we are a vanishing country, that we are falling down. This makes no sense at all. We are a solid country. \ufeffMy job is to solve problems, but it's also to fight against caricatures and prejudices. Saying France is a sick man is a caricature and a prejudice. saying France needs to improve its economy is the truth, and it's exactly what we're doing. John Kerry insisted that president Assad must step down - there can be no chance of peace in Syria otherwise. And he expressed deep concern about the terrorism threat in the region,saying that Syria is the world's greatest single magnet for Jihad and terror. But military action is not the solution to the conflict, he added. Just been in a press conference with French finance minister Pierre Moscovici ( of which more in a moment!). John Kerry is giving his set-piece speech now -- expressing solidarity with the people of Ukraine, and warning that the hard work with Iran starts now: We'll have details shortly, but in the meantime here are the key points: Sir Martin Sorrell, the boss of the WPP advertising group, has told David Cameron that he'd be a \"shoo-in\" to return to Downing Street in 2015, if he dropped his pledge for a referendum on Britain's place in Europe. Speaking at the CBI's lunch for business leaders, Sorrell said there would be a \"very good economic backdrop \" next year, with growth of 2.5% per year, perhaps higher. But Cameron risks blowing that advantage by putting the UK's place in the EU in doubt, Sorrell warned, saying that the business community believes Britain should stay part of Europe. While the Labour Party is \"taking politics to the left\", Sorrell said, Ed Miliband does believe Britain should remain in the EU. He declared: \ufeff\"If the Conservative Party said it was against a referendum after the election, it would be a shoo-in\" (quotes via Larry Elliott who was at the lunch) There's also plenty of reaction to David Cameron's speech calling on UK companies to bring manufacturing home under the banner Reshore UK. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said the government needed to work more closely with the EU, which may not be music to his ears: First and foremost, the UK must provide a competitive cost base, skills in sufficient numbers and certainty about the returns over the lifetime of those investments if we are to secure the benefits of this trend. The Prime Minister set out some of what the government is doing to achieve this but there is still work to be done. Not least in our engagement with Europe. His focus on a pro-business, pro-growth agenda in Europe is welcome, the UK needs to ensure it keeps that agenda on track to make greater levels of re-shoring back to Europe and the UK a reality. Neil Rami, head of Business Birmingham, the city\u2019s inward investment agency, welcomed the speech but brought up some other bugbears for the PM \u2013 immigration restrictions and high energy costs: Re-shoring can help forge the new economy, creating jobs and cutting our trade deficit. We have seen that in Birmingham with Jaguar Land Rover, who will open a \u00a3500m factory in Wolverhampton next month with 1,400 staff. The launch of Reshore UK is a very welcome step. It shows we are serious about bringing business back to these shores and will help reverse the trend of production and jobs being sent abroad. Restrictive regulations \u2013 such as visa regulation and commercial regulations \u2013 and high energy costs are big barriers which need to be pulled down. SF Our economics team have been taking a closer look at the coalition's claims that UK take-home pay is rising for most people. Here's what they say: The government numbers are old and cover April 2012 to April 2013. After then, pay growth fell considerably. The latest official data put it at 0.9%, down from 1.4% a year earlier. The numbers do not cover the self-employed, whose numbers have grown due to redundancies and cuts to hours in the downturn. There are 500,000 more self-employed than before the crisis. At least one real take-home pay survey suggests pay still falling for many workers and for many it is down more than 7% since the start of the recession. The government's view is not a complete analysis of how well-off people feel as it doesn't cover benefits changes and therefore not their disposable income. Scott Corfe, an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr), said: \ufeff\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the figures relate to 2012 to 2013. It was really in 2013 that we saw pay growth start to fall quite sharply. Earnings growth fell in 2013. I think the picture would be very different if you looked at 2013-14. I think it would be worse.\u201d ONS data on average weekly earnings \u2013 not the data used by the government in its analysis \u2013 cover a much more recent period and show earnings growth failing to come even close to keeping pace with inflation. Inflation has come down to be back at its target of 2% in December from 2.1% in November. That was still double the pace of average earnings growth, which was 0.9% in September to November 2013, down sharply from earnings growth of 1.4% a year earlier. Cebr\u2019s Corfe compiles a monthly take-home pay report for the salary processing company VocaLink. Its latest numbers this week showed workers in the public sector and manufacturing continued to see their take-home pay fall in real terms. The squeeze was the toughest for public sector workers who are \u00a323 a month worse off than a year earlier in real terms, according to VocaLink, which processes salary payments for much of the British workforce. Some experts do believe pay patterns are improving. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit Williamson said Markit\u2019s monthly household finances index showed some pick up in people\u2019s total pay but he questioned whether hourly pay was actually rising: I think pay is up more than the official data is showing at the moment and we will even start to see those numbers start to improve in 2014. We are definitely hearing that people are earning more \u2013 not necessarily their pay rates but they are taking home more pay because they are getting more hours and little bonuses. SF Anna Maria Corazza Bild, the Swedish MEP who challenged David Cameron on immigration this morning, has warned that the PM is \"playing with fire\" Speaking to Jill Treanor, she warned that: This rhetoric has consequences... A Romanian and a Belgian in Britain is not a migrant. A British passport holder who was born in Rome, Bild said Cameron appeared to be saying the UK wanted to remain in the EU under renegotiated terms, one of which was the restriction of movement. Reaction to Mark Carney's speech is streaming in. The CBI approves and says business needs more time before rates start to rise: CBI director general John Cridland said this: \ufeffThere are increasing signs that the economy is back on track and the investment cycle now needs to turn. This should boost productivity and go hand-in-hand with the growing number of jobs. With slack in the labour market and inflationary pressures easing, but productivity not yet rising, business will welcome the Governor\u2019s comments on interest rates. Interest rates should remain low to help sustain the recovery. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight points out that MPC members have been out on manoeuvres in a \"communications offensive\" to make sure the \"no rate rise\" message sticks: MPC members Paul Fisher, Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale have all stressed in speeches and newspaper articles over the last couple of days that interest rates could stay at 0.50% for some considerable time after the unemployment rate gets down to 7.0% and lower... While it is not clear yet how the Bank of England will update its forward guidance policy, it looks like strong communication will be a major part of the bank\u2019s efforts to limit interest rate hike expectations given the high visibility of MPC members in recent days. And here, via Twitter, is some insight from the Telegraph's cartoon investment banker Alex Masterley: SF No time for a Q&amp;A with president Rousseff, so Klaus Schwab thanks her for the speech, saying her words on foreign investment should have reassured the room. We hope you and your government score as many goals as possible, he concludes. President Rousseff said \"I invites you all to join us\" in increasing Brazil's foreign investment, and then adds that she also invites delegates to the upcoming World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. Rousseff ends by insisting that Brazil is \"poised and ready for the upcoming World Cup\" (despite concerns that stadiums will not be ready in time). Football, she says, can be a powerful weapon to fight discrimination. We have our arms wide open to welcome visitors from all over the world. Rousseff welcomes the \"historic deal reached\" at the World Trade Association recently. And she argues again that countries such as Brazil need not be hurt by the Federal Reserve tapering, saying: \ufeffA new world economic growth cycle is now under gestation. As the crisis recedes, we will certainly see emerging markets see new attention. With a long-term strategy focused on fostering investment, on education, and on increased productivity we hope to come out of the current business crisis even better off. She says Brazil wants to encourage more foreign investment partnerships -\"We have always welcomed foreign investment\". President Rousseff explains how Brazil will continue to work with private-sector firms - both from Brazil and overseas. We have held five highway auctions, transferring over 4,000 km to private sector hands. Concession deals for 6 airports granted to consortiums led by large private corporations We will obtain $28bn through the life of these partnerships, We will authorise new privately run ports in 2014, she pledges. \ufeffBrazil is a country that is as vast as a continent, so we need a proper railway system, especially for grain and ore outflow, and for container transport. We'll hold our first auction for one stretch of railway in 2014, she says. We do not compromise on inflation, she continues. Inflation remains under control in Brazil, Rousseff continues, and we are purposefully aiming for the mid-point in our inflation target. Dilma Rousseff moves onto the issue of last year's protests in Brazil - saying they were actually an important part of the country's journey. Citizens have a better understanding of their rights, and have new demands, she says. Some of these new Brazilian citizens were in last June's demonstrations out on the streets. Those demonstrations were an \"inseparable part of our process of building democracy and fostering social change\". \"My administration did not crack down on those demonstrations. On the contrary we heard and we understood the voices of the street,\" she says. Those protesters wanted more rights , argues Rousseff, saying once people have experienced democracy, social inclusion and quality of life they want more. Brazil's transformation in recent years has pushed millions more up to the middle classs. We have created 4.5m new jobs in the last few years, and we are creating a mass consumer market. 45% have a computer 55% have an automatic washing machine 17% have a freezer 8% have a flatscreen TV This clearly shows the size of the consumer demand still to be met, she insists Dilma Rousseff rattles through the economic history of the last few years, and then argues that the recovery in the developed economies does not mean the the emerging markets will necessarily suffer. Emerging economies will still play a strategic role -- we still offer the best opportunities for growth, and deep reserves of natural resources. To assume emerging economics will be less-dynamic in the future an over-hasty conclusion, she argues. Developed economies suffered most from the crisis, so as they emerge from the crisis they should stimulate more growth across the global economy. This is a big speech for the Brazilian president - she will want to reassure business leaders that Brazil remains a good place to invest. Klaus Schwab is introducing president Rousseff, praising her efforts on fighting social inclusion*, and welcoming her very cordially to the snow of Davos. * - no mention of the protests in Brazil last year, unsurprisingly Swiss cow bells are ringing in the congress hall, because it's time for Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, to give a special address. They're ringing a bit quieter now, though -- after the bell-toller was told to shush so French finance minister Pierre Moscovici could give a TV interview. Rousseff's speech will be broadcast here. A clip of David Cameron's appearance at Davos this morning: Bono has just launched a scathing attack on companies who are fighting demands for more disclosure about their activities. Sitting alongside David Cameron on the Development Goals panel (highlights start here), the rock star said: \u201cSome of the criminals around here not wearing ski masks, they are wearing skis\u201d. A campaigner against poverty, Bono referred to the \u201cevil twins\u201d that the business community needs to tackle \u2013 opacity in the extractive industry and the ability of companies to hide their assets in companies registered in secretive tax havens. US companies are now required to disclose how much they pay for mining rights \u2013 a move being restricted by some of them \u2013 while the EU is also taking steps to force companies to show their beneficial owners. Bono cited the legal battle from the American Petroleum Industry to resist having to disclose payments to foreign governments (details here). (via Jill Treanor) Amusing moment on the Development Goals panel -- starting when Prudential boss Tidjane Thiam argued that the key to development goals is to unlock private sector assets. We can invest easier than politicians, who need to get things through parliament, he argues. Prudential could put 10% of its $800bn assets into Africa. Thaim claims: \ufeffWhat is missing is a pipeline of projects, of bankable investments opportunities. We want to invest. Nigeria's finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala responds smartly: We can give you bankable investments.... Amid laughter, the moderator steps in saying \"Davos is a place for doing deals\" -- tell him how you going to make Nigeria the place for his investments. They're there, she insists. \"Tidjane just has to persuade his board\". And Jasmine Whitbread, CEO of Save The Children, says it's also important to make as much progress on the 2015 goals over the next 700 days. About half of them have been achieved, but the second half will be harder. David Cameron smiles when the panel moderator congratulates him on including almost every major issue facing the world in the post-2015 development Agenda -- from climate change to gender equality. But shouldn't we leave a few out, to make progress on the rest? Cameron replies that you can't tackle poverty without including these issues (there are 12 goals in total). He says he's particularly pleased that the panel added goals on corruption and governance for the first time -- this is a key factor in poverty today, he says. As Cameron puts it: Why is North Korea poor and South Korea rich. It's not the weather, it's not the part of the world the're living in, it's to do with the institutions under which they live and the governments running those countries. Cameron adds that his big worry is not that there are too many goals, but that \"we end up with nothing\" if policymakers keep talking about these goals instead of addressing them. Nigeria's finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala agrees that the goals are important - saying the panel could easily have had 20. Elsewhere in Davos -- a star panel is discussing how to implement the goals for development and fighting poverty after 2015. It includes Nigeria's finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Bono, David Cameron, and Prudential CEO Tidjane Thaim. It's being streamed here. More details of Mark Carney's comments on UK monetary policy, and reaction to it: Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, is telling business leaders and journalists right now that the UK economy has not yet reached 'escape velocity' . Carney also says that the Bank will update its forward guidance on future interest rate rises (now unemployment is close to its 7% target much sooner than expected). From the lunch, Larry Elliott reports that Carney pledged that the degree of stimulus would \u201cremain exceptional for some time.\u201d Carney added: \u201cThat should help reassure British business that the path of interest rates will be consistent with a sustained recovery \u2013 that is, with escape velocity.\u201d The Bank has been surprised by the recent performance of the economy, having predicted last August that it could be early 2016 before the jobless rate hit 7%. \u201cA few quarters of above-trend growth driven by household spending represent a good start, but they aren\u2019t sufficient\u201d, Carney said as he discussed the prospects for permanent exit from the deepest recession of the post-war era. \u201cIt will take sustained growth, more balanced demand and a recovery in the supply side for advanced economies to break free into a more normal universe.\u201d And on forward guidance - his first big move as governor - Carney said: \ufeff\u201cThe MPC will consider a range of options to update our guidance, recognising both what we have learned about the behaviour of aggregate supply in the economy as well as the more benign inflation outlook.\u201d Other highlights from Wolfgang Schauble's session- he said France was, and remains, a strong country. And he backed David Cameron's point this morning, that Europe needs treaty change to improve the institutional structure of the eurozone. Mats Persson of the Open Europe think tank suggests that means closer controls on other country's budgets. Speaking of woods - Larry Summers attack on George Osborne's fiscal programme this morning didn't go down well with conservative party officials: Larry Elliott has written about the Osborne-Summers spat here: US secretary of state John Kerry is due to address Davos at 5.15pm -- ahead of the speech, senator John McCain has apparently warned that America's influence on world affairs is weakening. Isa Soares of CNN has the quote: Early this morning, we mentioned George Soros's concerns about the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Syria - an issue Kerry will surely cover in his speech. Wolfgang Schauble also touched on the issue of immigration, saying that one cause of the political instability in Greece is the flow of migrants from Africa. He says Europe must show solidarity with Greece, and develop new ways to handle migration. On Greece, Wolfgang Schauble admitted that he would not have fancied implementing such a tough austerity programme in Germany What the Greek population has had to bear is incredible. They have made progress, but they are not out of the woods, Schauble said. Back in Davos, finance minister Wolfgang Schauble has been on stage discussing the outlook for Germany, and beyond. Schauble points to the progress made in the eurozone, declaring: \ufeffWe are no longer the main source of concern for the financial markets. We are not completely out of it.... but we've come far. Has the crisis come to an end? No, no, no there are more efforts to be deployed. Schauble also claimed that Europe's recession would have been much worse without the \"driving force\" of the German economy (critics might suggest that without Germany, the euro would have been weaker and the ECB could have delivered more unconventional policies) At Davos, David Cameron mentioned Hornby as a company that has brought some manufacturing back to the UK. But the company is still suffering supply chain problems with the factories who make its products in China. Lack of supply in the last few months of 2013 will send annual sales below expectations and last year's result, the train set, Corgi car and Airfix maker warned. Along with the falling value of currency held to buy the products, the delays will cause a \u00a31m annual loss. Hornby has been reporting these problems on and off since 2010 so surely there's a case for pleasing the PM and bringing all manufacturing back so management can just hop in the car to check everything's running smoothly. City AM's pun-laden interpretation is below. SF Markets are digesting Mark Carney's comments on forward guidance overnight at Davos. The Bank of England governor indicated to Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight that interest rates wouldn't rise in the near future, despite unemployment falling to near the BoE's 7% threshold for considering a rise. Carney is giving a speech at Davos just after midday. He seems to have stolen his own thunder by going on the telly the night before but let's see what he says. Here's what CMC Markets' Michael Hewson makes of Carney's interview: Last night\u2019s comments shouldn\u2019t really have been a surprise given comments he made in November last year \u201cone could imagine a scenario where the unemployment threshold is reached and that the best policy for the MPC at that period of time is to keep rates at current levels because the trade-off between output and inflation is attractive,\u201d he said. With inflation now at 2% the Bank is clearly playing that trade-off. Away from the glamour of Davos, Martin Weale, an external member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, has been checking out the local economy in Suffolk. The East Anglian Daily Times reports that Weale, who voted against Carney's forward guidance plan, doesn't want the MPC to revise its criteria for considering a rate rise. There are no quotes from Weale in the story but this is what the paper reports: \ufeffThere have been suggestions the MPC should now lower the 7% threshold to, perhaps, 6.5%, but Mr Weale said he did not believe this would achieve the core aim of Forward Guidance, that of creating greater certainty, as any new threshold could also quickly be overtaken by events. However, he said the MPC had been clear all along that the unemployment rate was only one of many factors which would shape any decision to raise interest rates and, with wage increases still well below inflation, there was scope for rates to remain at their current level for a while yet. Interesting stuff, especially after Carney's interview and fellow MPC member Paul Fisher's speech yesterday when he said he couldn't see an \"immediate need\" to increase rates. MPC members are free to express their individual views \u2013 or is this a coordinated message to the market? SF Back in the UK, the big company story is Royal Mail's trading statement covering Christmas. It's the first time the group has reported this all-important period since it floated last year. The overall message is that everything's in line with expectations and Royal Mail is on track for its full-year targets. Investors are a bit underwhelmed: after rising early on, the shares are down 0.5%, in line with the market, at 584.5p. That's still almost 80% up on October's 330p flotation price. In the nine months to the end of December, like-for-like revenue was up 2% and parcels made up 51% of revenue. Parcels are important for Royal Mail because that's where the growth is, fuelled by people buying online, while letter sales are falling as we switch to email and, more recently, social media. In UK parcels, revenue was up 8% as Royal Mail charged more for bigger items but volumes were flat. Consumer volumes fell as people held off posting big items made more expensive by the size-based pricing. Here's what chief executive Moya Greene said: We remained the nation's number one parcel delivery company, handling 115 million parcels in the month of December alone. That's significantly more than any other carrier in the UK parcel market. GLS, our ground-based European parcels business, has performed well and is exploiting the growth opportunities in the Eurozone. Our financial performance to date is in line with our expectations and gives us confidence that we will deliver against our key value drivers for the full year. SF To recap, the British PM has told world leaders and business men and women that the UK, and Europe, can reshore jobs back home, and declared that shale gas energy help drive the recovery. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos (highlights start here), David Cameron said it was wrong to think European countries are in terminal decline because of globalisation, saying: Whether it's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision - the East wins while the West loses; and the workers lose while the machines win. I don't believe it has to be this way. \"Of course, we shouldn't be starry-eyed about globalisation - it presents huge challenges as our economies and societies try to adapt - but neither should we take this pessimistic view. Britain, he declared, can be the Reshore Nation. He wants European countries to step up to the challenges, by reducing regulatory burden on firms and reforming labour markets. Cameron also insisted that Europe must embrace shale gas, and learn from the US: \ufeffThere is no doubt that when it comes to re-shoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas. And during a lively Q&amp;A session, Cameron said he backed the living wage, but only for those organisations who can afford it; and defended his position on immigration from new EU member states. And that's the end of the session. The final question is a corker -- with a top executive from the Hinduja Group telling Cameron that he's been coming to Davos for 25 years, and seen leaders from the days of Edward Heath. The British, I know, are the best brains in the world. This is my experience, I don't know what the rest of the world thinks about it.... So why not focus your poverty programmes on Africa to get more progress? Cameron thanks the compliment paid to his fellow countrymen. He won't take the compliment personally, as: \ufeffI work with a lot of people who are a lot brighter than I am, and I see that every day. Cameron says he's proud that his government sticks to his promise of paying 0.7% of GDP in aid. Aid can do an enormous amount, fighting disease and helping people out of poverty. But it also gives us an opportunity to make arguments about the other things that hold countries back, says Cameron. Countries who made the jump from poverty to success are those who include people in development, he says. We need to be franker and tougher in fighting corruption, enforcing the rule of law, backing democratic institutions -- what he dubs The Golden Thread that runs through development. A Lufthansa executive asks Cameron how he'll change his economic policies if Scotland quits the Union and Britain quits the EU. Cameron says Scotland and the rest of Britain are stronger and safer together, and the message is getting through, And on Europe, the PM says: \ufeffI'm confident we'll have a successful renegotiation and a successful referendum. The eurozone needs change, he says. Not a single currency in the world that can cope without common fiscal policy, banking union, and the current treaties don't allow it. We can seize the opportunity to reshape our relationship with EU. Excellent, Cameron takes a question from Frances Grady of the TUC. She welcomes Cameron's suggestion that Reshoring could bring back well-paid jobs - is he backing the TUC living wage campaign? Cameron replies that if we get our economic policy right, our labour market right, if there is flexibility, then we can return jobs at all levels of pay. We've made 4 new private sector jobs for each public sector one lost. Employers who can afford a living wage should pay it, Cameron says, and pays tribute to Boris Johnson for implementing it at City Hall. I want people paid more, but we need to show we are succeeding with productivity and output. If you implement the living wage across the country, then you could cost jobs not make them. I support it, but people should pay it when they can afford it, and around the country you are seeing people like councils offering it. Cameron says he welcomes widening the EU to more members, alongside the new measures on migratory reforms. Right, onto questions, and a Swedish MEP asks Cameron to justify his recent comments on migration. And she also asks him to tell his colleagues in the European parliament to be more constructive to make progress. You are a key player - you would achieve smarter regulation if you work with us, rather than undermine us. Cameron says one of Britain's roles in the world is to speak clearly on things it agrees with, and disagrees with. He defends his European Parliament MEPs for doing a good job fighting regulation. And on immigration -- The right to move within European Union and apply for jobs is an important freedom which he supports. But, It should not be a right to move to claim benefits. I make absolutely no apology for tightening UK welfare system so it can't be abused. When Britain allowed new members to the EU in 2004 without a transition period, 1.5m people moved here. The biggest migration in recent history, says Cameron I say with future accessions, we need new transitional controls, longer transitional periods. And he points out that the situation changes when you are looking at countries with very different GDP levels, than those with similar ones. He dubs his position \"Practical good Conservative common sense, and that's something the EU needs a lot of\". A few laughs in the room. Now onto another popular issue for Cameron - fracking. Done properly, he argues, shale gas can deliver affordable energy with less environmental damage than many other sources. And he warns that the EC is still proposing too much regulation, despite recent changes. If Europe puts too much burden on shale industry, then producers will go elsewhere and Europe will be dry. Don't hold back on telling governments what they need to do, he urges business people in the world. What do we need to get reshoring to work? Cameron outlines some predictable themes -- cutting red tape, reducing burden on companies, and also reforming labour markets. He cites a big investment deal in Spain which was achieved after the Spanish unions agreed to recast working conditions. Cameron says he's not claiming that there are a finite number of jobs in the world; and he's not suggesting that UK firms will turn their back on the world. I'm not saying we are going on a race to the bottom , says Cameron, insisting that reshoring can create permanent, high quality jobs. Europe has an opportunity to accelerate this trend of jobs coming back home. Cameron also says that Europe must never sell the right enshrined in liberal democracy, saying he tells bosses in Davos to check how often a country's government loses court cases before deciding if it's safe to invest there. Sadly in Britain it's far too often, he adds, but that shows we respect the rule of law. Cameron cites several factors driving US companies back 'onshore'. Pay, especially executive pay, has risen in countries such as China, and a shorter supply chain helps firms get products into the shops fast. He also claims that the US push into shale fracking has also encouraged firms back into America. The UK can do the same, he says: \ufeffThere is a chance for Britain to become the Reshore Nation. But now, there's an opportunity for jobs that have gone abroad in recent years to come home, Cameron says, reversing the recent trend. Surveys show this is happening already in some industries, he says. He cites several firms who have moved manufacturing back home, such as trainmaker Hornby and the Raspberry Pi computer firm. Cameron hails inward investment, such as India with Jaguar Landrover and China with our new nuclear deal at Hinkley In a time of austerity, we chose to keep investing in science. We cut corporation tax, especially those for firms investing in the UK. Britian is open, pionerring, innovative, and ready for your investment, says the PM. Cameron outlines the UK's economic programme, key points include: Controlling debts Getting welfare and immigration under control improving schools for young people to help them get jobs Better infrastructure and lower taxes for businesses Cameron points out that the IMF has raised its growth forecasts, and unemployment is down again, because the UK is focusing on its strengths. The key challenge is how do European countries tackle globalisation, says Cameron. For years, critics have been saying that Europe is in terminal decline, from the twin threats of developing nations and emerging technologies. That's wrong, he says. Need to get fundamentals of our economies back -- tackle our debts, make our economies competitive, we can succeed and sell goods around the world. Get it right and jobs that have been sent around the globe can come home, says Cameron. Cameron starts by joking that he's been through the seven-year itch at Davos, and decided to stick with the relationship in year eight. Right, David Cameron is now on stage -- it's his eighth Davos in a row. It is being streamed live here. After a standing ovation, the Israeli president is presented with a special cowbell - a signature of Davos - rather than a mere medal. WEF founder Klaus Schwab said Peres is being recognised for \"Tolling the bell of peace and harmony\". Peres promptly grasps the bell and gives it a good ring now, saying he wants to go around the Middle East ringing it as a call to peace. Shimon Peres describes himself as a dissatisfied optimist, as he contrasts the vision of what can be done with the reality today. And he exalts those in the room to devote themselves to work, not to entertainment. The greatest interest and the greatest entertainment, is in working. Do it right, and you'll be happier than you'd think, he concludes. Shimon Peres is giving a captivating speech on the future, explaining how aid to the developing world must change because much of the money goes to the rich not the poor. And how technology, such as small, cheap computers, will bring massive changes to the developing world. I'll try to get the whole text later.... Terrorists are flooding into Syria, says Peres, and Iran must share the blame for the situation, Peres continues, for sending Hezbollah into the country. He's arguing that the future for the Middle East must lie with young people across the region. The current crisis in the Middle East is tearing the region to pieces -- there is no coherent country today, say Peres. And on Syria, he says that \"all the elements in Syria are not elements for solutions, but are elements for confrontation\". We need a new element - made of two parts, the younger generation and science. Now Shimon Peres is receiving a special Spirit of Davos award. Asked about Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's speech yesterday, when he didn't include Israel in the group of countries which it recognised and wanted to build closer ties. We got a smile - it's nice, but it's not an answer, says Peres. While Iran's willingness to open up is a positive, the refusal to recognise Israel is a negative. For us Iran is not an enemy, we don't want to fight, Peres continues. It's wrong to spend so much money on military systems. He cites South Africa's exclusion from the global community over apartheid as proof that countries will change their ways under pressure. Some reaction to the clash between Osborne and Summers: The session's now over -- David Cameron will be on stage in the Congress Hall soon. Does the quality of the new jobs in the UK matter? Aren't lots of them estate agents? That's a bit harsh on estate agents, Osborne replies. Manufacturing jobs are rising, for perhaps the first time in his lifetime, and we can now consider raising the minimum wage because the economy is stronger. What does George Osborne think of the 'scribblers' in the media who have written overnight that forward guidance is a significant failure? \"I completely reject that forward guidance is a failure\", Osborne replies. The bank of England has provided clear communicatoins, supportive monetary policy,which has - alongsid the govenrment's efforts - delivered very strong data in the UNited Kingdom. Our unemployment recovery is the equivalent of 500,000 or 600,000 new jobs in the US. I cannot see strong unemployment data as a failure of monetary policy, Osborne continues. When is it time to dampen the animal spirits in the UK housing market, Osborne is asked? That's one for the Bank of England, says the chancellor, saying it has already tightened mortgage approvals and removed mortgage lending from its Funding for lending scheme. One of the lessons of the crisis is you need to bring all these tools into the central bank -- monetary policy more than just interest rates. Our macroprudential policy is one of the best in the world, he adds. Osborne defends himself saying: We did have a much bigger fall in GDP [than in the US], and the impact of the crisis was even harder because our banking sector was a larger share of the economy than in America. The great recession in the UK had an even greater effect - and we were one of the worse effected of any of the Western economies. Summers isn't impressed, saying that \"the deeper the valley you're in, the more rapidly you're able to grow. But we have a shared interest in emphasising our points of agreement, despite the best efffots of our moderators, Summers jokes. And that common ground includes the importance of stimulating demand through increased investment. This is turning into a ding-dong battle between Larry Summers and George Osborne, with the former US treasury secretary criticising the UK's fiscal consolidation approach. Summers says he and Osborne are in complete agreement on importance of stimulating private investment, and very much in agreement in the importance of public investment. But then he points to the US context - the right investment strategies are win-win-win - you grow the economy, they grow the tax base, collect more revenue and substantially pay for themselves. Look, we'll fix Kennedy Airport one day -- let's do it now and avoid a future fiscal burden. I see less need to impose cuts on people who are vulnerable in the US context than the chancellor sees in the European context. And then he claims Osborne is wrong to use the eurozone debt crisis. Those rising borrowing costs were due to the specific nature of the eurozone currency -- Summers says, such as the fixed exchange rate and no individual central banks. And while he's gratified to see growth in the UK now, it would have done better to follow the American approach. It's several years since the US exceeded its peak GDP before the crisis -- that still hasn't happened in the UK. Are businesses reluctant to spend because they don't believe you'll stay in office to complete your plan?  Osborne says he has a vested interest in remaining in office to complete the job. And he points to projects such as the new nuclear programme at Hinkley, and plans for fracking, to show that the UK government is \"are prepared to take difficult decisions\" that will let infrastructure spending flow. Now a question for George Osborne on the minimum wage -- are firms profiting on the back of welfare? (because tax credit are topping up smaller pay packets)? Why, when we're almost at the Bank of England's threshold, do we not see confidence from business sector to invest? Osborne responds to Larry Summers comments , saying that he agrees there is an infrastructure deficit - we should be spending more on transport infrastructure and science. But there is no \"free lunch\" - you need to take tough decisions elsewhere in your budgets, in areas such as welfare spending. Without a credible fiscal policy, as many other countries learned in this crisis, you don't have a credible monetary policy and your market rates go up. So while infrastructure spending is need, you need to make \"hard choices\" as finance minister as how to pay for it. And after the \"near-death\" experience of the euro, businesses have been sitting on their cash, Osborne added. Back to Japan's central bank governor Kuroda -- how will you unwind your massive bond-buying programme? Inflation is only halfway to our 2% target, he replies, so it's not time to stop our stimulus yet. We are carefully watching how the Fed is handling its normalisation process. The Fed has handled the situation pretty well he says -- without causing disruption in the markets. We will handle our normalisation process carefully, and not cause a negative market reaction, he pledges. Geoff Cutmore points out that the Fed only did well on it's second go at tapering its bond-buying programme. Swiss central bank Thomas Jordan remains a critic of forward guidance on monetary policy - saying too much detail can confuse the markets. Asked about the impact of US tapering, Brazil central bank governor Alexandre Tombini says that it will be a net positive in the long term, despite short-term problems. Larry Summers also pointed out that the US is spending much less on life sciences than before the crisis. Some instant reaction: Summers then outlines his fears over secular stagnation -- saying we're have effectively been no new jobs created in the US since the crisis began. Will there be a new debt ceiling fight? We will not see the kind of brinkmanship we saw before, Summers says. He then argues passionately for an increase in government spending to create more growth and drive down unemployment. If we can borrow at 3% for 30 years, and unemployment in construction in in double digits, \" If this isn't the moment to fix Kennedy airport, when will it come?\"  Summers says that while its funny on one level, in other ways it's not: It's tragic that we are bequeathing our children a deficit in the form of massive deferred maintenance on our infrastructure. That looks like overt criticism of George Osborne's deficit reduction plan. Now Larry Summers, former US treasury secretary, is asked whether the huge monetary stimulus programmes did any good. He says they helped avoid a repeat of the Great Depression. The last four years have been nothing like the 1929-1933 period - that's a tribute to the decisions taken by president Obama and in other countries around the world, says Summers. If you had known at the start of the crisis how bad it would be, people would have expected much more protectionism than we've seen, adding: \ufeffI give credit to our British friends for the London summit in March 2009 where that principle was established. That's a tribute to Gordon Brown, the former UK PM, who organised that summit. Onto Japan's central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda -- should we be concerned that the looming sales tax hike will scupper the Japanese recovery? Kuroda argues that it will not, as monetary policy has taken account of the looming sales tax rise. Japan's economy is growing at 3% - so even after the sales tax takes place, in 2 stages, the economy will still grow at 1% to 1.5% percent, which is well over Japan's medium term trend, Kuroda says. But could it be reversed if it does cause problems? Kuroda says that it's natural to expect households to spend more before the tax rise occurs, and then spend less afterwards. So, no knee-jerk reaction. So are you sleeping more easily, chancellor? Osborne replies that: There's a huge amount to be done to fix the damage done by the great recession, and to avoid the mistakes of the past. Cutmore asks George Osborne to comment on Mark Carney's interview last night where he said interest rates would not rise anytime soon in the UK, even though the unemployment rate is near the 7% threshold in Carney's forward guidance. I'm not his boss, for one thing, says Osborne, and he can't comment on monetary policy -- that's the MPC's job. The fact we're discussing exiting stimulus is a sign of success, it's a sign of an economy taking off. We are only having this discussion because the recovery is underway, unemployment is falling, says Osborne. However the job is not done, it's not even half-done, Osborne adds -- we need to work on ways of moving to a situation where businesses provide more investment to stimulate the economy. And the Bank of England have tools to prevent a housing bubble. Haruhiko Kuroda is the man sharpening the tips of Japanese prime minister Abe's arrows, Cutmore adds. Introducing the panel, CNBC's Geoff Cutmore jokes that George Osborne picked Mark Carney to run the Bank of England because he realised you need a foreign manager to get success. And look, the economy is growing and unemployment is falling. OK, the first session on the future of monetary policy is starting now. It's being streamed live here. If you've not already enjoyed it, do check out Larry and Jill's report of a session yesterday at Davos on meditation, led by US actress Goldie Hawn. \ufeffTwo bits of advice are being offered to those gazing at their difficult thoughts. Do not try to hide away from the problem and equally do not try to explode it like a time bomb. Much better to let it melt away \u2013 \"slowly melting like the frost under the morning sun\". And breathe ... Goldie Hawn and a monk teach meditation to the elite In Davos, Chile's finance minister is insisting that his country can ride out any turmoil from neighbours, such as Argentina's currency crisis. The BBC's Alice Baxter has the details: Something different from George Soros this year, at his traditional dinner at the WEF last night (reports Larry Elliott) Normally, the Davos faithful flock to hear what the legendary financier thinks will be the next global currency to tank. This year, though, Soros used his dinner to focus exclusively on the humanitarian crisis in Syria, where the civil war has caused untold suffering. Soros said: \"International governance has failed.\" \"We can't ignore the victims. The attention of the global community is lacking in Syria. It is a human catastrophe of the first order.\" Soros said international public opinion could affect the behaviour of the Assad regime, which he accused of pursuing a policy of \"surrender or starve\". Yesterday's speech by Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has caused a political storm back home -- the opposition Labor party are furious that it included criticism of its fiscal policy while in office. As Katharine Murphy explains: Labor had delivered a stimulus package during the global financial crisis, and kept spending, because the then government had a philosophy of \u201cspending its way to prosperity\u201d, the prime minister argued. The new Coalition government in Canberra was pro-market and small government. There is a convention in Australian politics that domestic issues stay at home when leaders embark on overseas visits, and Labor on Friday argued Abbott would be better placed to respect it. Tony Abbott \u2018embarrassing\u2019 in Davos, says Bill Shorten Hello from Davos, Switzerland, where day three of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There's a packed list of speakers today -- kicking off with a debate on the future of monetary policy in under an hour, at 9am Swiss time (8am GMT). UK chancellor George Osborne, Japan's finance minister central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda, Brazil's Alexandre Tombini, Swiss central bank chairman Thomas Jordan, and professor Larry Summers are all on the panel. Hopefully they'll give views on the alarming tumble in the Argentinian peso's value this week. That's followed by David Cameron's special address (10.30am Swiss time). Al Gore, Ban Ki-moon, and Bill Gates are all on a panel discussing growth and development at 11am. At 12, Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's finance minister, discusses the outlook for Germany. And in the afternoon we get special addresses from Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff (2.15pm), US secretary of state John Kerry (5.15pm) and ECB president Mario Draghi (6pm).",

      "bodyText": "Millions of mobile phone subscribers will be handed contracts locking them into annual price rises after O2, the second largest British operator, changed its terms and conditions despite new rules designed to protect consumers. From Thursday, all customers were supposed to be able to leave their phone or broadband provider without penalty if their tariff was increased midway through a fixed-term contract, after a crackdown by the telecoms watchdog Ofcom. But the regulator's victory on behalf of households squeezed by the rising cost of living appears to have been shortlived. Hours after the new rules came into force, O2 announced a 2.7% price hike and a clause in its contracts under which customers will forfeit the right to walk away. Critics said that if other operators follow suit, Ofcom's reform will have succeeded only in locking yearly inflation in for consumers. The Ofcom rules applied only to new contracts, which meant that anyone on an existing deal could already face price rises. O2's move means that all of its customers on pay-monthly bundles will see costs go up. Consumer group Which? described O2's announcement as \"disappointing news\". Ofcom was persuaded to act on the issue after Which? lodged a formal complaint and 60,000 people backed its campaign for fixed contracts without loopholes. A total of 10 companies, including Vodafone, BT, Sky and Virgin Media, had put up prices having offered a \"fixed-price deal\" when customers took out the contract. O2 is increasing prices for its 8 million monthly consumer contract customers as soon as 1 March, in line with the retail prices index (RPI), which stood at 2.7% in December. According to the explanation on O2's website: \"An increase of this kind does not entitle you to end your agreement mid-contract. As set out above, our terms for customers signing up both pre- and post- 23 January allow us to apply a price increase to reflect RPI.\" With new smartphone deals typically running for 24 months, customers are likely to face two prices hikes during their contract. In the past, O2 has only changed tariffs mid-contract once before \u2013 with a 3.2% rise in February 2013. The new contract suggests a rise is now guaranteed once a year. \"We will increase your Monthly Subscription Charges during March 2014 and from 2015, and each year thereafter, during April, we will increase or decrease your Monthly Subscription Charges by the RPI Rate and we will publish on our Website the relevant RPI Rate as soon as it becomes available (an \"RPI Change\"). If we do this more often and/or by more than RPI then you'll have the right to end this Agreement under paragraph 5.4.\" Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: \"We'll be keeping a close eye on other operators to make sure they follow the rules and give customers clear information about contracts at the point of sale. Unfortunately our mystery shopping research shows this doesn't always happen when people buy mobile phones.\" Ofcom said the terms were legal so long as they were clearly flagged at the point of sale. A spokeswoman said: \"If a provider were to introduce increases beyond the price or prices a customer agreed to at point of sale, they would have the right to exit that contract without penalty. Ofcom will conduct research, such as mystery shopping, to assess the transparency of contractual information given to customers by providers at the point of sale\". If operators breach Ofcom's conditions, they can be punished by a fine of up to 10% of turnover. A spokesperson for O2 said its sales people would make shoppers aware of the new terms before they signed. He added: \"Price increases are never welcome but inflation has an impact on our costs. For most of our customers it will mean an additional charge of less than 60p on their monthly subscription.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More people sending Christmas cards and higher revenue from parcels helped Royal Mail achieve solid business over the first Christmas since the company floated on the stock market. The group said underlying sales for the nine months to the end of December rose 2%, helped by strong parcel demand and a rise in stamped mail over the month. Parcel volumes were flat over the nine months but rose during December. Parcels are important for Royal Mail because it is an area of the business that has been benefiting from the growth in online shopping, while letter sales are falling because of increased use of email and social media. In UK parcels, revenue was up 8% over the nine months as Royal Mail charged more for bigger items. Although consumer volumes fell as people held off posting big items made more expensive by the size-based pricing, sales to businesses rose. The company also blamed lack of parcel volume growth on wary business customers going elsewhere during a now settled dispute with the CWU union. Like-for-like letter sales fell 3% over the nine-month period but stamped mail, mainly Christmas cards, was up in December. The company said it was trading in line with its own expectations and was on track for its full-year targets. Royal Mail floated on the stock market in October in the biggest privatisation for many years. The sale has been criticised as short-changing the taxpayer after the shares surged far beyond the float price. Royal Mail shares rose in early trading but closed 15p lower at 573p following the figures \u2013 a 74% premium on the 330p float price. The share price performance since the flotation continues to prompt accusations that it was sold too cheaply. The chief executive, Moya Greene, said: \"We remained the nation's number one parcel delivery company, handling 115m parcels in the month of December alone. That's significantly more than any other carrier in the UK parcel market. \"Our financial performance to date is in line with our expectations and gives us confidence that we will deliver against our key value drivers for the full year.\" Greene could be in line for an increase in her \u00a31.5m-a-year salary after the company's chairman, Donald Brydon, suggested earlier this week that she was underpaid for the boss of a FTSE 100 company. However, the government indicated that it might block any large increases in executive pay. Analysts were generally positive about prospects for the business. John Lawson at Investec said: \"Royal Mail has made a good start as a listed entity and the statement indicated that the underlying trading trends are largely as we expected. Christmas is always a challenging period for the group and without any major weather hindrance Royal Mail has successfully navigated this peak season. Stay with it.\" Gert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon said: \"Following a strong share price performance, we have downgraded our recommendation from buy to hold. While we continue to see longer-term upside potential in the share price, especially if we assume that the dividend payout ratio is likely to increase, in the near term we expect the shares to tread water. We maintain our target price of 570p.\"",

They said that our public debt was unsustainable. They pointed to our supposed psyche of resignation as a symptom of relative decline.</p> <p>But now such voices are rarely heard. Japan's economy has swung from negative to positive growth and is on the verge of breaking free from chronic deflation.

And that is because we have overcome the notion that certain reforms could never be carried out. I have maintained that I am willing to act like a drill bit, strong enough to break through the solid rock of vested interests. And so we have.</p> <p>For example, we will completely liberalise Japan's electricity market. By the time the Olympians arrive in six years, the power sector will be fully competitive, with electricity generation separated from distribution.</p> <p>We will also foster medical care as an industry. Japan is on the forefront of regenerative medicine, and we will make it possible to generate stem cells at private-sector labs. And I have just proposed additional reforms, because we also need large-scale health-care providers in the form of holding companies, much like America's Mayo Clinic.</p> <p>Moreover, we are eliminating the \"rice production adjustment\" system, which has been in place for more than 40 years. Barriers to private companies' entry into the agricultural sector will be removed, and farmers will be allowed to grow the crops they want, without official control over supply and demand.</p> <p>Soon, our deregulation package will be set in motion. Over the next two years, in designated areas, no vested interests will remain impervious. For example, in Japanese cities aspiring to world-class status, limits on floor space will become a thing of the past. We will soon see high-quality housing, business complexes, and zero-emissions towns appearing, one after another.</p> <p>Likewise, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will remain a central pillar of my economic policies, and we will press ahead with the Japan-European Union Economic Partnership Agreement. As a result, Japan's economy will become even more deeply integrated into global flows of knowledge, trade, and investment. Companies and people from abroad will find Japan among the most business-friendly places in the world.</p> <p>Japan's management of public funds \u2013 such as the Government Pension Investment Fund, which now holds about $1.2 trillion \u2013 will also undergo far-reaching change. We will press ahead with reforms, including a review of the GPIF's portfolio, to ensure that public funds contribute to growth-nurturing investments.</p> <p>We must also make our corporate taxes internationally competitive. In April, the tax rate on companies will fall by 2.4 percentage points. And we will put in place tax incentives aimed at encouraging companies to use their cash for capital investment, research and investment, and wage increases.</p> <p>At the same time, we will reform labour-market rules that tie workers to old industries. New industries require innovative and creative human resources, and we will redirect our subsidies so that workers without meaningful employment in declining industries can move on and find rewarding work in rising sectors.</p> <p>Of course, given that Japan's population is rapidly aging, and the number of children is falling, investors find themselves asking an obvious question: \"Where will Japan find the innovative and creative human resources that it needs?\"</p> <p>Arianna Huffington once quipped that if Lehman Brothers had been \"Lehman Brothers and Sisters,\" the firm would have survived. Japan's corporate culture is even more male-dominated \u2013 a world of pinstripes and button-downs.</p> <p>I was greatly encouraged when Hillary Clinton told me that Japan's GDP could be 16% larger if women participated in the labour market at the same rate as men. Indeed, Japan's female labour force is the economy's most underused resource.</p> <p>Japan must become a place where women shine. By 2020, we want women to occupy 30% of leading management positions \u2013 a goal that presupposes a more flexible working environment, as well as support from foreign workers to take over domestic and personal services.</p> <p>A major impetus for change will come in the form of legal reforms, to be introduced at the next parliamentary session, that will increase the number of external directors on corporate boards. Next month, we will also propose a stewardship code that will enable institutional investors to play a greater role in corporate governance.</p> <p>I am confident that the combined effect of these reforms will enable Japan to double its inward direct investment by 2020, rebooting the entire country and changing its economic landscape dramatically.</p> <p>But there is still much to do. Soon, three years will have passed since the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami struck northeastern Japan on 11 March 2011, causing the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. While the recovery is far from complete, the love and compassion reflected in the world's response touched us deeply, as has the survivors' spirit of perseverance and mutual aid to overcome hardship.</p> <p>It is in the same spirit that Japan is now set to contribute even more positively to world peace and development. In our age, no single country can preserve peace by itself. None of us alone can solve the challenges that the world faces without helping one another.</p> <p>In Cambodia, for example, a Japanese-built hospital for mothers and newborns has helped to reduce the country's infant-mortality rate. In the Philippines, Japan's Self-Defense Forces mounted a major relief effort after the devastating typhoon in November. And our servicemen and women based in Djibouti remain on high alert against piracy, protecting ships from around the world.</p> <p>Japan is surrounded by neighbours with unlimited possibilities: China, South Korea, the ASEAN countries, India, Russia, and, across the Pacific Rim, the TPP partner countries. Indeed, with Asia becoming the engine driving the world economy, the need to achieve lasting peace and prosperity has never been greater, because the global knock-on effect of any threat to regional stability would be enormous.</p> <p>The foundation underpinning prosperity is freedom of movement for people and goods. On sea-lanes, in air space, and now in outer space and cyber space, freedom of movement must remain secure. The only way to maintain these indispensable public goods is by rigorously upholding the rule of law and promoting fundamental values like freedom, human rights, and democracy.</p> <p>There is no alternative. Asia's growth dividend must not be wasted on military expansion. We must use it to invest in innovation and human capital, which will further boost growth in the region. As is true elsewhere, trust among Asian countries is crucial for their peace and prosperity, and this can be achieved only through dialogue and adherence to international law, not through force or intimidation.</p> <p>In order to create a region of trust and order, I would like to appeal to Asia and the world. To prevent unchecked military expansion in Asia, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/22/japan-china-military-buildup\" title=\"\">defence budgets should be made completely transparent, with verifiable public disclosure</a>. Moreover, Asian governments should create a mechanism for crisis management and strong communication channels among our armed forces. We must also establish rules that promote behaviour based on international maritime law.</p> <p>Only then can we achieve lasting growth and prosperity in Asia, enabling all of us in the region to realise our great potential.</p> <p>Japan has pledged that it will never again wage war, and we have never stopped working for a world that is at peace. It is my fervent hope that Japan's economic revival, with its promise of increased global and regional prosperity, will help to bring such a world closer.</p> <p>\u2022 Shinzo Abe is Prime Minister of Japan</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2014.</p>",

Indeed, Japan's female labour force is the economy's most underused resource. Japan must become a place where women shine. By 2020, we want women to occupy 30% of leading management positions \u2013 a goal that presupposes a more flexible working environment, as well as support from foreign workers to take over domestic and personal services. A major impetus for change will come in the form of legal reforms, to be introduced at the next parliamentary session, that will increase the number of external directors on corporate boards. Next month, we will also propose a stewardship code that will enable institutional investors to play a greater role in corporate governance. I am confident that the combined effect of these reforms will enable Japan to double its inward direct investment by 2020, rebooting the entire country and changing its economic landscape dramatically. But there is still much to do. Soon, three years will have passed since the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami struck northeastern Japan on 11 March 2011, causing the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. While the recovery is far from complete, the love and compassion reflected in the world's response touched us deeply, as has the survivors' spirit of perseverance and mutual aid to overcome hardship. It is in the same spirit that Japan is now set to contribute even more positively to world peace and development. In our age, no single country can preserve peace by itself. None of us alone can solve the challenges that the world faces without helping one another. In Cambodia, for example, a Japanese-built hospital for mothers and newborns has helped to reduce the country's infant-mortality rate. In the Philippines, Japan's Self-Defense Forces mounted a major relief effort after the devastating typhoon in November. And our servicemen and women based in Djibouti remain on high alert against piracy, protecting ships from around the world. Japan is surrounded by neighbours with unlimited possibilities: China, South Korea, the ASEAN countries, India, Russia, and, across the Pacific Rim, the TPP partner countries. Indeed, with Asia becoming the engine driving the world economy, the need to achieve lasting peace and prosperity has never been greater, because the global knock-on effect of any threat to regional stability would be enormous. The foundation underpinning prosperity is freedom of movement for people and goods. On sea-lanes, in air space, and now in outer space and cyber space, freedom of movement must remain secure. The only way to maintain these indispensable public goods is by rigorously upholding the rule of law and promoting fundamental values like freedom, human rights, and democracy. There is no alternative. Asia's growth dividend must not be wasted on military expansion. We must use it to invest in innovation and human capital, which will further boost growth in the region. As is true elsewhere, trust among Asian countries is crucial for their peace and prosperity, and this can be achieved only through dialogue and adherence to international law, not through force or intimidation. In order to create a region of trust and order, I would like to appeal to Asia and the world. To prevent unchecked military expansion in Asia, defence budgets should be made completely transparent, with verifiable public disclosure. Moreover, Asian governments should create a mechanism for crisis management and strong communication channels among our armed forces. We must also establish rules that promote behaviour based on international maritime law. Only then can we achieve lasting growth and prosperity in Asia, enabling all of us in the region to realise our great potential. Japan has pledged that it will never again wage war, and we have never stopped working for a world that is at peace. It is my fervent hope that Japan's economic revival, with its promise of increased global and regional prosperity, will help to bring such a world closer. \u2022 Shinzo Abe is Prime Minister of Japan Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2014.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At the heart of the debate over pay and living standards there should be a simple question: is pay going up faster than prices? As the government has highlighted, the answer is anything but simple. Taking the figures for weekly pay published every month by the Office for National Statistics makes the job relatively easy. At the last measure in November, wages were rising by 0.9% and inflation, according the international standard Consumer Prices Index (CPI), was 2.1%. That's a steep fall in real incomes on the year before and reflects a trend going back to the financial crisis of deteriorating living standards. The government says this analysis fails to account for income tax cuts and that a better understanding of real pay and disposable incomes can be seen if the figure is calculated after tax and not based on gross pay. The analysis looks at the working population broken down into 10 income groups and says all but one are better off after after tax and after taking inflation into account. First on the list of criticisms is the government's view that this presents a picture of an improving situation. It does not. The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) from the ONS is already eight months out of date. Since it was calculated, wage growth has been falling. ASHE is an annualised calculation of monthly figures that some labour market economists believe is flawed. There are lots of seasonal adjustments and statistical quirks that divorce the annual figure from its weekly cousin. Setting aside those criticisms, it judged that salaries rose 2.2% from the previous year's total of 1.5%. Since then a separate weekly pay figure has dropped from 1.4% to 0.9% \u2013 giving a clue that employers are not rewarding workers as they once were. Then there is the judgment that CPI is a poor measure of inflation in Britain because it excludes housing costs, which distort outgoings in the UK more than other country. The Retail Prices Index is arguably a better measure of inflation, says Ken Mulkearn of Income Data Services and is still the mainstay of wage negotiations for that reason. RPI was 2.9% in April 2013, compared to a CPI rise of 2.4%. Only the poorest two deciles in the government breakdown beat the RPI figure for April 2012 to April 2013. Another problem for the government comes from the decision to complicate the picture and yet not include changes to other taxes and benefits. Why just income tax? If the idea is to paint an impressionistic vision of rising disposable incomes, then Labour's view that cuts in tax credits and child benefit, which disappeared in January 2013, are also relevant. Disposable income is a knotty problem with many variables and no government is going to give even an impression of how different income groups stand. For one, the latest ONS figures show incomes are rising after a dramatic increase in hours worked. So some people are feeling better off because they are working longer days, not after a decent, inflation-busting pay rise. There has also been a large shift into self employment, with 500,000 more people working for themselves since 2008. The self-employed, who are not included in the government's analysis, can offset their expenses against their income and adopt all kinds of legitimate strategies to achieve a profit figure. It may not give a good guide to their disposable income and standard of living. The government's figures also focus on a particular element of ASHE that tracks the pay of people who've been in employment for more than a year. Pay rises for this group averaged 3.1% compared to the overall 2.2% ASHE pay hike. Mulkearn points out that the difference is acounted for by generally lower-paid people moving to jobs with fewer hours or lower pay. They drag down the average. This would tend to support the government's stance that the majority of workers improved their after-tax income in the year to last April, but only if the other factors are ignored.",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron's hardline immigration policy came under fire on Friday at the World Economic Forum as the prime minister was forced to defend restrictions on new entrants to the UK. Using a setpiece speech to put the case for re-shoring jobs to the UK from overseas, the prime minster also set himself on a collision course with environmental protesters by outlining the importance of developing shale gas in the UK. A member of the audience in Davos \u2013 Swedish MEP Anna Maria Corazza Bildt \u2013 was applauded as she asked for her British counterparts to be more co-operative in the European parliament and questioned Cameron about Britain's restrictions on immigrants to the UK. He said he made \"absolutely no apology\" for changes to the British benefits system. \"The right to move in Europe and apply for jobs in other European countries is an important freedom in the Europe Union \u2026 [but] it is right to move to go and work and not a right to go and claim benefits,\" he said. He pointed to the flow of 1.5 million people into the UK when eight new members joined the EU in 2004 \u2013 \"the largest migratory movement in recent British history\". Cameron is trying to avoid a row with his own MPs by preparing to make changes to the law to make it difficult for future governments to allow unlimited migration from future EU member states. Since the start of 2014, new migrant jobseekers from the EU have had to wait three months before they receive jobseeker's allowance. The focus of his speech was that Britain was open for business, setting out the case for secure energy policy, the UK court system and freedom of the media. He urged the EU to avoid \"burdensome, unjustified and premature\" regulations on fracking after the controversy caused by French oil firm Total investing in exploiting shale gas in the UK. It is banned from such activities in France. Cheap and affordable energy would encourage re-shoring, he said, as he set out the benefits of shale gas to the US. \"There is no doubt that when it comes to re-shoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas, which is flooring US energy prices, with billions of dollars of energy cost savings predicted over the next decade,\" said Cameron. \"If this is done properly shale gas can have lower emissions than normal gas,\" he said in an attempt to head off criticism that the fracking process can be harmful to the environment and local living conditions. \"Look at what shale gas has done for America \u2013 for American firms and American jobs,\" Cameron said, pointing to a million more jobs and half a trillion dollars of GDP each year to 2030.

David Dooks, statistics director at the BBA, said the figures provided more evidence of \"a more active housing market\", stimulated by growing consumer confidence and government support schemes such as Help to Buy. The BBA said first-time buyers were benefiting from government initiatives, helping the overall chain of house buyers. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest sign of a strengthening housing market would \"fuel concern that we are on the way to a new housing bubble\". He is forecasting an 8% increase in house prices in 2014, with gains across the UK. Bank of England governor Mark Carney acknowledged on Thursday night that there were some concerns at Threadneedle Street about the housing market. \"We worry about the momentum that has picked up in the housing market, that's without question,\" he told the BBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos. In November the Bank acted on those concerns by refocusing its Funding for Lending scheme away from mortgage lending and exclusively on lending to businesses. The BBA data showed that lending to businesses dropped by \u00a3650m in December, smaller than the \u00a32.032bn fall in November. Britons meanwhile spent \u00a395.5bn on credit cards in 2013, 11% more than in 2012, but annual growth towards the year-end slowed. Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that rents increased by 1% across Britain in the 12 months to December, a slight fall on November's figure of 1.1%. Rents rose by 1% in England, 1.2% in Wales and 1.3% in Scotland, and were up across all English regions. London led the charge, with a 1.6% rise in prices. The figures cover rents in the private sector and unlike other indices are based on continuing tenancies rather than newly advertised properties.

After the Great Moderation and the Great Recession, there are several reasons why it will be years before any superlatives are attached to this recovery.\"</p> <p>Carney said the overall debt burdens of advanced countries had increased since the crisis, the global economy remained unbalanced and confidence remained fragile.</p> <p>But he said policymakers had avoided the mistakes made during the 1930s and there was a chance that a new wave of innovations would lead to a new era of growth, following the pattern of the post-second world war boom.</p> <p>\"Protectionism is being resisted, banks recapitalised, and the global financial system rebuilt. In parallel, monetary policy is highly accommodative,\" he said.</p> <p>\"As the global economy gains momentum, staying the course on these policies will be decisive to achieving escape velocity. The United Kingdom is at the centre of these decisions.\"</p> <p>Carney admitted that unemployment had fallen faster than predicted since August when, the Bank set a 7% jobless rate as the threshold for considering higher interest rates.</p> <p>\"The latest data show that more than a quarter of a million jobs were created in a three-month period \u2013 the biggest increase since records began in 1971. As a result, unemployment seems to be falling at a pace that will reach our 7% threshold materially earlier than we had expected.\"</p> <p>Many City economists expect unemployment to hit 7% within the next couple of months, but Carney said this would not lead to rates being raised from 0.5%, where they have been since early 2009.</p> <p>\"Crucially, unemployment remains above the level that is likely to be consistent with maintaining inflation at the target in the medium term. It is not just that nearly three-quarters of a million more people are out of work than before the crisis; another three-quarters of a million more people are involuntarily working part-time.\"</p> <p>Giving a clear signal that he favoured amending forward guidance to take account of the improving labour market, the governor said: \"It now seems likely that the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation in the medium term is somewhat lower than the MPC assessed back in August.</p> <p>\"In part that is because rates of transition into jobs, even for those who have been unemployed for more than a year, have been sustained at high rates, minimising the extent of skill atrophy. In addition, other measures of slack in the labour market, such as involuntary part-time working, remain high.</p> <p>\"This suggests that, even though unemployment is falling faster than expected, the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider moving away from the emergency setting of monetary policy. It is widely recognised that our 7% threshold is not a trigger for raising Bank rate.\"</p> <p>Carney said that when the Bank announced forward guidance it made clear that the 7% unemployment threshold was not an interest-rate trigger.</p> <p>\"The MPC will consider a range of options to update our guidance, recognising both what we have learned about the behaviour of aggregate supply in the economy as well as the more benign inflation outlook.\"</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney insisted on Friday that Britain's economy remains well short of achieving \"escape velocity\" from recession as the Bank of England governor said policy would remain on an emergency setting for some time to come. In a speech to UK business leaders in Davos, Carney said the Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee would look at its forward guidance strategy following the sharper than expected fall in unemployment in recent months. But he hinted that he currently favoured updating rather than ditching his flagship policy initiative and pledged that the degree of stimulus would \"remain exceptional for some time\". Carney added: \"That should help reassure British business that the path of interest rates will be consistent with a sustained recovery \u2013 that is, with escape velocity.\" The Bank has been surprised by the recent performance of the economy, having predicted last August that it could be early 2016 before the jobless rate hit 7%. \"A few quarters of above-trend growth driven by household spending represent a good start, but they aren't sufficient\", Carney said as he discussed the prospects for permanent exit from the deepest recession of the post-war era. \"It will take sustained growth, more balanced demand and a recovery in the supply side for advanced economies to break free into a more normal universe.\" The governor said there had been encouraging signs, with the UK and the US leading the way among developed countries and the eurozone at last showing signs of life. \"None of this is to suggest that current levels of economic activity are acceptable or that the world economy is no longer under strain. After the Great Moderation and the Great Recession, there are several reasons why it will be years before any superlatives are attached to this recovery.\" Carney said the overall debt burdens of advanced countries had increased since the crisis, the global economy remained unbalanced and confidence remained fragile. But he said policymakers had avoided the mistakes made during the 1930s and there was a chance that a new wave of innovations would lead to a new era of growth, following the pattern of the post-second world war boom. \"Protectionism is being resisted, banks recapitalised, and the global financial system rebuilt. In parallel, monetary policy is highly accommodative,\" he said. \"As the global economy gains momentum, staying the course on these policies will be decisive to achieving escape velocity. The United Kingdom is at the centre of these decisions.\" Carney admitted that unemployment had fallen faster than predicted since August when, the Bank set a 7% jobless rate as the threshold for considering higher interest rates. \"The latest data show that more than a quarter of a million jobs were created in a three-month period \u2013 the biggest increase since records began in 1971. As a result, unemployment seems to be falling at a pace that will reach our 7% threshold materially earlier than we had expected.\" Many City economists expect unemployment to hit 7% within the next couple of months, but Carney said this would not lead to rates being raised from 0.5%, where they have been since early 2009. \"Crucially, unemployment remains above the level that is likely to be consistent with maintaining inflation at the target in the medium term. It is not just that nearly three-quarters of a million more people are out of work than before the crisis; another three-quarters of a million more people are involuntarily working part-time.\" Giving a clear signal that he favoured amending forward guidance to take account of the improving labour market, the governor said: \"It now seems likely that the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation in the medium term is somewhat lower than the MPC assessed back in August. \"In part that is because rates of transition into jobs, even for those who have been unemployed for more than a year, have been sustained at high rates, minimising the extent of skill atrophy. In addition, other measures of slack in the labour market, such as involuntary part-time working, remain high. \"This suggests that, even though unemployment is falling faster than expected, the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider moving away from the emergency setting of monetary policy. It is widely recognised that our 7% threshold is not a trigger for raising Bank rate.\" Carney said that when the Bank announced forward guidance it made clear that the 7% unemployment threshold was not an interest-rate trigger. \"The MPC will consider a range of options to update our guidance, recognising both what we have learned about the behaviour of aggregate supply in the economy as well as the more benign inflation outlook.\"",

At the start of 2014, the financial gurus looked into their crystal balls and said that for the first time since the crash of 2008 they were more worried about emerging markets than the dull old west. There was some difference of opinion about where the sell-off would start. Some said Turkey, some said Indonesia, some thought history would repeat itself with Thailand being the first domino to fall, as it was in 1997. Few picked on Argentina, perhaps because the second-biggest economy in South America has appeared to be highly vulnerable for some time. Yet attention is now focused on Buenos Aires after the steepest fall in the peso since the crisis of 2002. That was the cue for a rapid search for safe havens, such as the dollar, as investors decided to dump all the other emerging market currencies. A mood that was already jittery as a result of concern about the impact of the gradual withdrawal of tapering by the Federal Reserve turned nasty very quickly. The trigger for the run on the peso was the decision by Argentina's central bank to stop intervening in the markets to defend the currency. The policy was proving extremely costly, draining Argentina of its foreign currency reserves. With high inflation already a problem, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner's government has been trying to prevent a fall in the value of the peso from pushing up the cost of living by raising the cost of imports. The government even imposed restrictions on online shopping this week in response to capital flight and a ballooning balance of payments problem. That policy is now in tatters. Just like the Bank of England in September 1992, Argentina has decided enough is enough and stopped intervening before the central bank is cleaned out completely. So what happens now? In Argentina, there is the prospect of capital flight, a sharp fall in the peso and higher inflation. In emerging markets more generally there is the prospect of contagion. Brazil, as Argentina's neighbour and a country already identified as one of the fragile five emerging markets (India, Indonesia, Turkey and South Africa are the others), looks most vulnerable. For the global economy, Argentina can be read one of two ways. Either it is a sign that the financial crisis of 2008 has a sting in the tail. Or it is the start of a new one.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England governor: interest rate rise not on the agenda", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An early increase in borrowing costs was ruled out by the governor of the Bank of England as he insisted that this week's faster than expected fall in unemployment will not lead to an automatic interest rate rise that might choke off the recovery. All but burying his \"forward guidance\" policy of linking an interest rate rise to a fall in the rate of unemployment to 7%, Mark Carney vowed to keep borrowing costs at their record low of 0.5% for the time being. He was speaking a day after it emerged that the unemployment rate fell to 7.1%. Interviewed on BBC's Newsnight, Carney rejected the idea that plunging unemployment was a headache for the Bank. \"If our forecast is going to be wrong it's better to be wrong in that direction,\" he said. Carney also said that when the Bank decided to raise interest rates for the first time since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, the moves would be gradual. Economists have warned that a rise to around 3% in the interest rate would lead to huge increases in mortgage costs and a wave of repossessions, as well as damage business. Downing Street and the Treasury have been looking nervously at the politically unpredictable consequences of repeated small interest rate rises before the general election in May 2015. Although the Treasury maintains that an interest rate rise would help savers and be a sign of an economy returning to normality, No 10 is more ambivalent. Downing Street feels assured that Carney is a practical Bank governor driven by the state of the real economy, unlike his more academic predecessor Mervyn King. The governor said the Bank's monetary policy committee would be looking at all aspects of the labour market and not just the unemployment rate. The MPC had used the 7% figure to enshrine the idea that joblessness would have to fall considerably before he would \"even begin to think about\" raising borrowing costs. Some City analysts are expecting Carney to announce in the next few months that he will lower the threshold at which the Bank would consider raising interest rates to an unemployment level of 6.5%. The governor said that would be decided by the MPC but added that it was \"really about overall conditions in the whole labour market\", where productivity remains poor and many people working part-time still want full-time jobs. Carney said the economy was \"coming off a low base\" and output was still below the levels when the economy dropped into its deepest recession since the second world war. \"The worst of the crisis is behind us but the financial system is not functioning as well as it could,\" he said. \"Uncertainty among households and businesses is still preventing investment.\" No 10 remains convinced that a year of growth, so long as it does not tip into over-heating, will ensure Labour's stubborn opinion poll lead is worn down into 2015. Although David Cameron urged voters to be patient on living standards, his aides believe average incomes, once tax changes are taken into account, are already starting to rise above prices. In a speech to business people in Davos, Switzerland, the prime minister will try to present his most optimistic long-term vision of the UK economy for many years , saying Britain can become \"the re-shore nation\" with businesses bringing production back to the UK, encouraged by cheaper energy costs and the lure of shorter customer chains. Cameron will hold out the example of the United States where collapsing energy costs owing to fracking have led businesses to relocate back to the US. He will say: \"There is no doubt that when it comes to reshoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas which is flooring US energy prices with billions of dollars of energy cost savings predicted over the next decade. \"I believe these trends have the ability to be a fresh driver of growth in Europe too. I want Britain to seize these opportunities. I think there is a chance for Britain to become the Reshore Nation.\" Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"The Tory-led government came to office promising an export-led recovery but the UK's trade deficit is growing. Any help for manufacturers is welcome after three damaging years of flatlining and in a month where factory orders have fallen back. \"But after so many government schemes have failed to deliver for business, manufacturers will want to see what this one offers in practice.\" Cameron's hopes for a boom built on fracking are not shared by the energy department, which is much more ambivalent about the ability of Britain \u2013 for geological, political and environmental reasons \u2013 to match the US fracking boom, at least not for more than a decade. The prime minister will try to rebut internal critics tired of the Tory party's negativity by striking a more optimistic note. He will say: \"For years the west has been written off. People say we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can't make anything any more. \"Whether it's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision \u2013 the east wins while the west loses, and the workers lose while the machines win. I don't believe it has to be this way. If we make the right decisions, we may also see more of what has been a small but discernible trend where some jobs that were once offshored are coming back from east to west.\" To back the rhetoric, UK Trade &amp; Investment will join forces with the Manufacturing Advisory Service to launch Reshore UK, a service to help companies bring production back to Britain.",

They go for the cheapest available. It is definitely in the mix of what they use,\u201d she said. \u201cI am deeply concerned fruit with dangerous lead levels could be served in hospitals, aged care homes or prisons and also concerned that if we lose our last fruit processor Australian customers may also no longer have a choice to buy Australian tinned fruit.\u201d SPC is the last major fruit processing operation in Australia. It has taken fruit from more than 100 fruit growers around the Victorian city of Shepparton, in Stone\u2019s electorate, although this number has been reduced in recent years. After cabinet first considered the proposed grant last year, the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, appointed a panel to report back on the company\u2019s long-term sustainability. It comprised the Telstra chair, Catherine Livingstone, a former Reserve Bank board member, Dick Warburton, and the former Labor government industry minister Greg Combet. Its report to Macfarlane has not been made public. Stone said some state governments had been informed of the test results. Labor\u2019s funding pledge was made on condition that SPC Ardmona and Coca-Cola Amatil agreed to maintain operations until 2020 and that the money could not be used to provide for redundancies, executive bonuses, payment of dividends or paying down existing debt. It would also have to pay back the money if it closed its Shepparton facility before an agreed date. Increased lead levels in food are particularly dangerous for young children and pregnant women.",
