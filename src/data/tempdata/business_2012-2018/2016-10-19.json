      "bodyText": "Uncertainty caused by the UK\u2019s Brexit vote has caused a slowdown in construction growth over the summer, according to the latest report from surveyors. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that while 19% more chartered surveyors reported that construction workloads in the UK had risen, rather than fallen in the third quarter, this was the lowest reading in just over three years. House building for private homes continued to expand, with 27% more surveyors reporting an increased workload than a fall, but in private commercial development fewer surveyors had seen increases in work than in quarter two. Rics said financial constraints, anecdotally linked to the decision to leave the EU, had been cited by 69% of respondents as the most significant barrier to growth in the third quarter of the year. Planning and regulatory delays were the next most substantial factor, named by 55% of respondents as problems. In London and the south-east of England, Rics reported a \u201csharp moderation in growth\u201d as a result of a slowdown in activity in the commercial sector. It added that workloads have stayed \u201cbroadly flat\u201d in Scotland for a second quarter. Jeremy Blackburn, Rics UK head of policy, said: \u201cIt seems that when it comes to private housing, we are indeed the builders. The government\u2019s commitment to this critical sector has clearly had a positive impact on growth.\u201d Those surveyed seemed optimistic that construction would pick up, with 49% more surveyors saying they expected a rise in workloads over the next year than a fall. On average, they expected activity to rise by 2.5% over the next 12 months. Expectations for employment growth had also improved with 35% more respondents forecasting a rise rather than a fall \u2013 about double the proportion in quarter two. However, workload and employment expectations were still lower than before the spring, and anecdotal evidence from surveyors suggested that the Brexit vote had made them concerned about their workoads. Simon Rubinsohn, Rics\u2019 chief economist, said: \u201cThe picture painted by the Q3 survey is one of subdued growth, and although expectations have improved following the immediate shock of the vote to leave the EU, anecdotal evidence from respondents suggests that much uncertainty still remains on the outlook for the year ahead.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ahead of next week\u2019s latest inflation figures, the new governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, gave his first speech on the topic of inflation and monetary policy. And while he remains concerned about entrenched low inflation, there seems little likelihood of lower interest rates in the near future. Australia, like many other nations, is experiencing very low inflation growth. Because major economies throughout the world are intricately linked, high or low levels of inflation invariably occur at the same time across all nations: Inflation across the OECD has for most of the last 20 years been relatively low, however most nations are currently experienced levels of inflation that are even below their 20 year average: That doesn\u2019t mean we are purely hostage to international forces, but they certainly play a role. Lowe highlighted this in his speech when he spoke of the reasons for our current low rate of inflation growth. He noted that the fall in oil prices over the past two years has seen \u201cthe price of petrol in Australia has declined by around 20%\u201d over the past two years. That alone \u201chas lowered the year-ended rate of headline inflation by almost 0.4 percentage points over each of these years\u201d. House prices by contrast increased the inflation rate by almost 0.4 percentage points: Given that Australia\u2019s national income is also very dependent upon commodity prices, the decline in oil and iron ore and (prior to the middle of the year) coal prices has seen our national income also struggle to grow. But the greater interconnectedness of Australia with the rest of the world is also reflected in greater competition \u2013 and with that comes competition not just for lower prices, but also over labour costs. Lowe noted that \u201cincreased competition has forced existing retailers to find efficiencies to lower their cost bases and, in turn, their prices.\u201d One major factor according to Lowe, is the increase in underemployment compared to unemployment (something I have recently noted) and that \u201cthat many of the people finding work recently have been employed in part-time jobs and report that they would like to work more hours\u201d. So combine low prices from abroad, increased competitiveness and an increase in the spare capacity of the employment sector and we have our current low inflation level. It is worth noting that the current low level of inflation is not completely unusual. The RBA targets inflation between 2% and 3%, and while it has now been nearly two years since it was within that range, for two and a half years in the late 1990s inflation was also below 2%: But there are a few differences between now and then. One of the most obvious is that our economy is growing a lot slower than it was then. From September 1997 to December 1999, Australian GDP grew annually, on average, by 4.6% compared to just 2.6% in the period since December 2014 when inflation has been below 2%. More marked is the difference between the growth of nominal GDP. Back then nominal GDP was regularly growing faster than 5%, whereas it is now four years since Australia experienced that level of growth: The other big difference is the level of interest rates. In December 1998, when the RBA cut rates to \u201coffer some additional support to growth through the adoption of a more accommodative monetary policy stance\u201d, it was cutting the cash rate from 5% to 4.75%: At that time, the \u201creal cash rate\u201d was 3.25% (ie the cash rate was 3.35% point above the inflation rate). At the moment, the cash rate of 1.5% is just 0.5 percentage points above the CPI and remains 0.5 percentage points below the bottom of the RBA inflation target band of 2%. It\u2019s one of the reasons why, even though Lowe is concerned about entrenched low inflation expectations, that interest rates are unlikely to be cut, even if the next inflation figure out next week shows inflation to be below 2%. Another reason is that Lowe is somewhat bullish that things are improving. He believes the bottom has likely been reached on low wages growth, and also that \u201cdomestic demand is expected to strengthen gradually\u201d coupled with improvement in commodity prices. As a result, the market has pretty much given up on the likelihood of another rate cut, whereas a month ago there looked to be around an 80% chance of another cut by this time next year: Lowe\u2019s speech also suggests a pretty smooth transition from the governorship of Glenn Stevens. Stevens, towards the end of his term, was rather clear about the declining ability of lower interest rates to stimulate growth. Since Lowe has taken over, he has suggested both in his speech this week and his appearance before the House of Representatives economics committee, that he agrees with this position. We have interest rates now at record lows, but unless something unexpected occurs, it would seem the RBA is not about to break that record any time soon.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "MPs' debate about Sir Philip Green's knighthood is premature", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green is clearly desperate to keep his gong. The Topshop tycoon would not be telling ITV viewers about his \u201chorrible, horrible, horrible\u201d summer, or recounting his heart trouble, if the knighthood didn\u2019t matter. We assumed as much, which is why the interview was mostly interesting for what Green, on the eve of a parliamentary debate about BHS and whether or not he should lose his knighthood, did not say about the mess at BHS. First, he did not indicate clearly when he thinks agreement will be reached with the Pensions Regulator. Instead he said: \u201cI am hopeful that we have some light in the tunnel to a solution,\u201d which has been his vague line for many months. The regulator\u2019s account was blunter: \u201cWe are yet to receive a comprehensive and credible written proposal and have made clear what we require.\u201d Second, Green did not say if BHS pensioners will receive the pensions they expected. He said he wants to get to a position where the Pensions Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-wide rescue scheme, is not required. But since the PPF rules mean basic-level pensioners must suffer 10% haircuts, BHS retirees could still take a hit. If such an outcome is in Green\u2019s mind, it would be better if he was frank. Those MPs who have followed this saga closely may also have been annoyed by Green\u2019s insistence on quoting a figure of \u00a3600m for what his family \u201cput back\u201d into BHS after taking \u00a3300m in dividends in the early years of ownership. His \u201cput back\u201d number includes \u00a3350m of \u201cinvestment\u201d that may cover the everyday costs of running a chain of department stores. A more useful figure in this context is net investment after depreciation: it was negative in 10 out of 14 years of ownership by the Green family, the select committee\u2019s report showed, quoting BHS accounts. Add it all up, and one suspects Green\u2019s plea for mercy will achieve little. It is odds-on that MPs will recommend that the knighthood be annulled, assuming the speaker allows a vote. Yet the attempt to put pressure on the honours forfeiture committee feels as if it has come too soon. Yes, Green is an unsympathetic character, his answers can be slippery and his attempts to shift blame onto his advisers are irritating. Yes, the sale of BHS to a thrice bankrupt individual whose outfit was described as a \u201cshambles\u201d by the two select committees was legal but shocking \u2013 or, as Green now admits, a mistake. And, yes, the delay in \u201csorting\u201d the pension deficit, which is Green\u2019s declared ambition, has become tiresome. If he had acted firmly when he owned the business, the funding position might not have deteriorated so severely. Yet, at the end of the process with the Pensions Regulator, Green will be presented with a bill and be expected to pay. If he refuses, the knighthood should be removed \u2013 no question. But if he pays up, what are the grounds for degonging? Green, albeit after faffing around for ages, would have met the demands of a regulator that enjoys the support of parliament. It would be better if MPs set a deadline for Green to do the right thing for BHS pensioners and then returned to the question of the knighthood. There\u2019s no need to kick the can any further down the runway Change is coming, Theresa May told us many times a few weeks ago. Only up to a point at Heathrow, it seems. Like her predecessors, May senses trouble on the runway. At a push, we could agree that is an advance on the previous indecision if the government will next week indicate a preference for a third runway at Heathrow. But retreating from a parliamentary vote on expansion until winter 2017-18 is feeble. The couple of Tory MPs who would resign their seats will presumably still be in a resigning mood a year from now. This column has always argued that Gatwick is the logical option for a new runway (it would be cheaper and more likely to happen) but Heathrow is a respectable choice from a political perspective since it had the backing of the Airports Commission, the body David Cameron formed to kick the can down the road and avoid his \u201cno ifs, not buts\u201d rejection of a third runway. Sir Howard Davies, as chair of that commission, is not a disinterested party but he is right when he says May should put expansion at Heathrow to a vote in the Commons without delay.

      "body": "<p>Sir Philip Green is clearly desperate to keep his gong. The Topshop tycoon would not be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-is-sad-and-very-very-sorry-to-bhs-workers-video\">telling ITV viewers</a> about his \u201chorrible, horrible, horrible\u201d summer, or recounting his heart trouble, if the knighthood didn\u2019t matter. We assumed as much, which is why the interview was mostly interesting for what Green, on the eve of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/sir-philip-green-criticises-mps-report-bhs-collapse\">parliamentary debate about BHS</a> and whether or not he should lose his knighthood, did not say about the mess at BHS.</p> <p>First, he did not indicate clearly when he thinks agreement will be reached with the Pensions Regulator. Instead he said: \u201cI am hopeful that we have some light in the tunnel to a solution,\u201d which has been his vague line for many months. The regulator\u2019s account was blunter: \u201cWe are yet to receive a comprehensive and credible written proposal and have made clear what we require.\u201d</p> <p>Second, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green\">Green</a> did not say if BHS pensioners will receive the pensions they expected. He said he wants to get to a position where the Pensions Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-wide rescue scheme, is not required. But since the PPF rules mean basic-level pensioners must suffer 10% haircuts, BHS retirees could still take a hit. If such an outcome is in Green\u2019s mind, it would be better if he was frank.</p> <p>Those MPs who have followed this saga closely may also have been annoyed by Green\u2019s insistence on quoting a figure of \u00a3600m for what his family \u201cput back\u201d into BHS after taking \u00a3300m in dividends in the early years of ownership. His \u201cput back\u201d number includes \u00a3350m of \u201cinvestment\u201d that may cover the everyday costs of running a chain of department stores. A more useful figure in this context is net investment after depreciation: it was negative in 10 out of 14 years of ownership by the Green family, the select committee\u2019s report showed, quoting BHS accounts.</p> <p>Add it all up, and one suspects Green\u2019s plea for mercy will achieve little. It is odds-on that MPs will recommend that the knighthood be annulled, assuming the speaker allows a vote.</p> <p>Yet the attempt to put pressure on the honours forfeiture committee feels as if it has come too soon. Yes, Green is an unsympathetic character, his answers can be slippery and his attempts to shift blame onto his advisers are irritating. Yes, the sale of BHS to a thrice bankrupt individual whose outfit was described as a \u201cshambles\u201d by the two select committees was legal but shocking \u2013 or, as Green now admits, a mistake. And, yes, the delay in \u201csorting\u201d the pension deficit, which is Green\u2019s declared ambition, has become tiresome. If he had acted firmly when he owned the business, the funding position might not have deteriorated so severely.</p> <p>Yet, at the end of the process with the Pensions Regulator, Green will be presented with a bill and be expected to pay. If he refuses, the knighthood should be removed \u2013 no question. But if he pays up, what are the grounds for degonging? Green, albeit after faffing around for ages, would have met the demands of a regulator that enjoys the support of parliament. It would be better if MPs set a deadline for Green to do the right thing for BHS pensioners and then returned to the question of the knighthood.</p> <h2>There\u2019s no need to kick the can any further down the runway</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"235d77c1c844542a33cbcf54da4c6ac72ae19025\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/235d77c1c844542a33cbcf54da4c6ac72ae19025/0_903_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s impression of proposed Gatwick expansion by architect planner Sir Terry Farrell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist\u2019s impression of proposed Gatwick expansion by architect planner Sir Terry Farrell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gatwick Airport/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Change is coming, Theresa May told us many times a few weeks ago.

Unveiling the plan to 65,000 staff on the eve of its annual meeting, chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said the \u201caspirational goal\u201d for more gender diversity would make the Anglo-Australian business more accountable. The bonuses of the most senior staff are to be partly linked to achieving a 3% increase in the female staff each year. Some 17% of staff are female. Mackenzie told staff: \u201cI\u2019ve heard the concerns: some employees think inclusion and diversity is not an area where we can make significant progress; some think women don\u2019t want to work in the mining industry, and some male employees have concerns they may be discriminated against, or that they may be overlooked for a promotion. These points have all been raised with me. \u201cSo let me say this \u2013 the path to create a more inclusive and diverse workplace will be challenging as significant change often is. It will require us to make inclusion and diversity a greater priority. It will demand that we question our own biases when we make decisions, that we make our workplaces more flexible and that we challenge dated stereotypes about jobs in the resources industry.\u201d He said there had been unconscious bias in the industry and that women had been disadvantaged. In the company\u2019s \u201cmost inclusive and diverse sites\u201d performance is 15% higher, he said. The annual meeting, being held in London, is likely to be the scene of protests by Brazilians affected by the collapse of BHP Billiton\u2019s Samarco dam a year ago, which killed at least 19 people and devastated the local environment. Representatives of the local community in Brazil\u2019s Minas Gerais region, as well as people affected by projects in Colombia and Indonesia, are expected to present a list of demands to the company. The Fund\u00e3o dam owned by Samarco \u2013 a joint venture between BHP and Brazilian firm Vale \u2013 collapsed on 5 November last year. Protesters, including a Franciscan monk and a farmer from Minas Gerais, will stage a re-enactment of the disaster before presenting a list of demands calling on BHP to do more to make up for the damage. A spokesperson for BHP said: \u201cThe annual meeting is an opportunity for shareholders to ask us about a wide range of issues and we look forward to answering their questions.\u201d Regarding Samarco, the spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we cannot bring back the lives that were lost, we continue to focus on ensuring that the families and communities affected by the tragedy are supported.\u201d",

A paper co-authored by Andy Haldane, Threadneedle Street\u2019s chief economist, said there was evidence the surprise announcement of additional bond buying had reduced long-term borrowing costs for the government and business, raised share prices and boosted exports through a lower exchange rate for the pound. QE has come under scrutiny in recent weeks as a result of comments by the prime minister in her Conservative conference speech about the bad \u201cside effects\u201d of the policy and Hague\u2019s assertion that a scheme introduced in emergency conditions in 2009 had become \u201cunpopular and counter-productive.\u201d The Bank said its analysis of QE \u2013 both in the UK and in other parts of the world \u2013 had yielded three key results. First, the purchase of assets by central banks had a \u201csignificant\u201d impact when they were explicitly used as a tool of monetary policy. Second, the impact varied over time and depended on how the economy and the financial markets were faring. Finally, the impact of QE had strong cross-border effects, with evidence that the actions of the US Federal Reserve had an influence on the UK economy as large as that on the American economy. The Bank said the comprehensive package announced by its monetary policy committee on 4 August to dampen the shock of the EU referendum result provided a \u201cclean case study of the impact QE might have on financial markets and the various asset market channels in operation. \u201cThe effects on the yield curve, equity prices, corporate bond spreads and the exchange rate were all large and significant, consistent with a material loosening of credit conditions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It was not a convincing performance, but European stock markets managed to end the day in positive territory. There was the usual nervousness - Brexit, US interest rates - with the added bonus of some caution ahead of the final US presidential debate later and the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate and QE decision on Thursday. UK jobs figures came in strong enough to suggest that the Bank of England may hold off on cutting interest rates next month, while supportive comments from chancellor Philip Hammond about the Bank\u2019s independence and the future of finance companies in the City post-Brexit also gave some support to shares. A jump in the oil price following a surprise drop in US crude stocks helped sentiment too. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 21.86 points or 0.31% higher at 7021.92, having earlier fallen as low as 6975 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.13% to 10,645.68 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.25% to 4520.30 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.46% to 17,044.34 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.96% at 8950.1 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.14% to 593.02 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.42%. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 2.3% at $52.89, but the pound has edged 0.18% lower against the dollar to $1.2274. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with UK unemployment, and IHS Markit thinks unemployment could continue to rise: And now for the big autumn blockbuster: QE: The Story So Far. The Bank of England has just issued a 73 page working paper, which MPC member Andy Haldane will be discussing later at Cass Business School, on the effects of quantitative easing. Interesting of course, in the light of prime minister Theresa May\u2019s criticism of the effects of monetary policy in her Tory party conference speech. Here\u2019s the blurb from the Bank: In the past decade or so, a number of central banks have purchased assets financed by the creation of central bank reserves as a tool for loosening monetary policy \u2013 a policy often known as \u2018quantitative easing\u2019 or \u2018QE\u2019. The first half of the paper reviews the international evidence on the impact on financial markets and economic activity of this policy. It finds that these central bank balance sheet expansions had a discernible and significant impact on financial markets and the economy. The second half of the paper provides new empirical analysis on the macroeconomic impact of central bank balance sheet expansions, across time and countries. It finds three key results. First, it is only when central bank balance sheet expansions are used as a monetary policy tool that they have a significant macro-economic impact. Second, there is evidence for the US that the effectiveness of QE may vary over time, depending on the state of the economy and liquidity of the financial system. And third, QE can have strong spill-over effects cross-border, acting mainly via financial channels. For example, the impact of US QE on UK economic activity may be as large as the impact on US economic activity. The full report can be found here\u201d Staff working paper 624: QE: the story so far The rise in the oil price - to its highest since July 2015 - is giving a lift to the FTSE 100 as trading heads towards the close. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE appears to be following oil prices higher this afternoon, with initial selling giving way to gains into the close. Fears that earnings forecasts were too high have been shown, thus far, to be unproven, with the result that equities have been able to rally once again. This afternoon\u2019s sharp drawdown in crude inventories will be welcomed by oil bulls, with a reduction of 5.2 million barrels confounding market expectations of a second consecutive weekly rise. Lower inventories do not always translate into lower production, yet a smaller amount of oil sloshing about is surely likely to improve the supply and demand dynamic, hence the outperformance of WTI over Brent. The FTSE 100 is currently up around 25 points at 7025, after earlier falling as low as 6975. Oil prices are on the rise after new US figures showed a surprise drop in crude stockpiles last week, compared to expectations of an increase. The Energy Information Administration said US crude stocks fell by 5.2m barrels, when analysts had been forecasting a 2.7m rise. The news of increased demand has seen Brent crude climb 2.6% to $53.05 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has jumped 3.2% to $51.93. Earlier crude received some support from renewed hopes that producers would take measures to reduce output, but some were sceptical. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih saying many nations are willing to joint the OPEC production cut was taken with a pinch of salt. Philip Hammond\u2019s comments are giving some support to the UK markets, according to Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index: Hammond\u2019s testimony to the Treasury Committee has, so far, helped to support the pound and UK stocks this afternoon, although they haven\u2019t ignited a major wave of buying of UK assets either. The markets seem comfortable, rather than ecstatic, about his comments including confirmation that the Bank of England will remain independent, and that no conclusion has yet been reached on the exact Brexit deal that will be sought by the UK government. He admitted that there are different opinions in the cabinet over how to approach Brexit, however Hammond and May are reportedly close, so his view could suggest that May\u2019s own view is less severe than she put across at her Party conference. Although the pound has fallen back from its intra-daily highs versus the dollar at 1.2332, Hammond\u2019s comments seem to support the pound/dollar around the 1.23 level. We believe that, on balance, his comments that nothing is set in stone regarding Brexit, is more market-friendly than the \u201chard\u201d Brexit rhetoric that has come from Number 10 in recent weeks. Although Hammond is not giving anything away at this stage of his testimony, it gives the markets a glimmer of hope that the UK may not target a \u201chard\u201d brexit. His opening comments did mention that the current government will bring down net migration to the UK, however, he hasn\u2019t linked this to throwing out access to the EU single market or customs union. This is significant, as it is a softer approach from what the market had perceived from PM Theresa May\u2019s comments at the Tory Party conference at the start of this month. Hammond said the government will not pursue the policies outlined by former Chancellor George Osborne in April, which included a further cut to corporation tax, however this was to be expected. Regarding the economic impact from Brexit, the Chancellor said that he would examine the fiscal and economic impact of all Brexit options. From a \u201cRemainer\u2019s\u201d perspective, this seems like a more sensible approach to leaving the European Union, compared to some of the extreme approaches that appeared to disregard the economic impact in favour of reducing immigration. Although Hammond is giving nothing away, his comments may sooth some economic concerns regarding the Brexit process. Overall, his comments so far seem to be supportive of the current recovery in the pound and FTSE 100. But whether or not these gains can be sustained, could depend on this evening\u2019s final US Presidential debate. A win for Clinton could sew up the race for her, which could be a short-term positive for the buck, but may limit further sterling gains. Away from the UK, and US stock markets have struggled for direction in early trading, ahead of the final presidential debate later. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 opened a couple of points higher. But Nasdaq dipped at the open after chip maker Intel issued a disappointing update. Earlier US housing starts fell to a one and a half year low in September, down 9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.05m units. Analysts had expected a rise form 1.15m to 1.18m units. On trade deals outside the EU, Hammond says it would not be appropriate to enter into substantive trade talks with a third country until Article 50 is triggered. On Brexit, Hammond is asked by chair Andrew Tyrie if we are leaving the customs union. Hammond says there are discussions taking place, and no conclusions have been reached on the precise arrangements. But this will be a negotiation between two sovereign entities, he says we should not be constrained by existing structures. In that case we must be leaving the customs union? We haven\u2019t made an decision, repeats Hammond. Hammond is being quizzed on monetary policy, and says it is the responsibility of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee and there are no plans to change this. This follows prime minister Theresa May\u2019s comments at the Tory party conference which were taken as an attack on the Bank. As a reminder, chancellor Philip Hammond is about to give evidence to the Treasury select committee. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be following events in detail in the politics live blog: And there is a live feed from Parliament TV here. Over in the markets, the pound continues to hold steady against both the dollar and the euro, as the latest data suggests the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates in November: We flagged up earlier (10.28am) that half the new jobs gained by women in the last year were part-time. Women also bore the brunt of layoffs in June-August; some 23,000 joined the unemployment total, pushing the female unemployment total up to 765,000. And many of those in work are finding life tough, according to Carole Easton, Young Women\u2019s Trust Chief Executive. She says: \u201cToday\u2019s statistics show that the employment rate for young women has increased from 60.5 per cent to 62.4 per cent. While the small increase is welcome, those that do have jobs often find them insecure and low-paid. \u201cThe Young Women\u2019s Trust annual survey found that more than a quarter of young people in work are worried about not having enough paid hours and 39 per cent of young women struggle to make their cash last until the end of the month. More than one in five young people have been paid less than the minimum wage. Almost four in ten young people in work are worried about their job security. \u201cThe majority of young people we spoke to told us they are worried about their future. This is why Young Women\u2019s Trust is calling for a reduction in the use of zero hours contracts and for young people to be paid the National Living Wage.\u201d Our economics editor Larry Elliott fears Britain is heading for its second wage squeeze in a decade: During and after the recession of 2008-09, workers sacrificed pay in order to hold on to their jobs, even when sharply higher oil prices meant wages were not keeping pace with inflation. Another squeeze on living standards is now in prospect courtesy of the recovery in the cost of crude and the fall in the value of the pound. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s analysis on today\u2019s labour market report. Here\u2019s the official government response, from employment Minister Damian Hinds: \u201cOnce again it\u2019s great news for Britain as the employment rate remains at a record high, with more than 31.8 million men and women in work. But there\u2019s more to do, particularly when it comes to supporting young people into employment. We want to build a solid base for the future; that\u2019s why today I have announced the rollout of our Jobcentre Plus Support for Schools scheme in England, which will give tens of thousands of young people help in taking their first steps into the world of work.\u201d [ends] This scheme will give 12-18 year olds advice on writing a CV and preparing for interviews. ITV has more details: Jobcentre staff to offer pupils \u2018soft skill\u2019 training The opposition Labour party, though, are concerned that the unemployment total rose by 10,000, and that wages may be squeezed. Debbie Abrahams MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, says: \u201cWhen taken with the wide regional and gender differences in employment rates, and inflation rising, there is a real risk to the living standards of British people under this failing Tory Government. Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the CBI, says that the UK labour market looks \u201cresilient\u201d, with the unemployment rate at an 11-year low of 4.9%. He also agrees that wages aren\u2019t growing fast enough, and wants Theresa May\u2019s government to help. \u201cPay growth is still lacklustre though, emphasising the need for new partnerships between business and the Government that brings a laser-like focus to improving productivity. This is the only route to sustainable, long-term improvements in pay growth.\u201d Another handy chart from the Resolution Foundation: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, also fears a pay squeeze is looming: Pay still appears to be unresponsive to what is a fairly tight labour market, meaning rising inflation will take its toll on living standards. While the unions worry about pay and inflation, small business leaders are fretting about how they\u2019ll keep their firms growing in the current uncertain climate. Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), hopes that chancellor Philip Hammond will lend a hand in next month\u2019s Autumn Statement: \u201cAs more people enter the Labour market and look for work, it will be more important than ever for the Government to support small businesses to keep creating jobs. \u201cSmall businesses are resilient but face significant challenges from faltering levels of confidence and higher costs from policy changes like the National Living Wage. As the Autumn Statement approaches, it is crucial the Government doesn\u2019t place extra burdens on business, prioritises long-term investment, enterprise policy and innovation, and reaffirms the commitment to permanently increase business rate relief. Sam Hill of RBC Capital Markets also fears a wage squeeze next year, echoing the TUC\u2019s concerns. He believes earnings are unlikely to keep pace with inflation, especially if the economy slows sharply: Against the expectation of a material slowdown in economic growth in 2017, it seems unlikely that wage growth will break above the \u201ctwo-point-something\u201d range it has roughly resided in since early 2015. After yesterday\u2019s news of a faster-than-expected jump in CPI inflation to 1.0% y/y, and the high probability of further upward pricing pressure to come, the main theme of this week\u2019s economic data is the emerging trend of a squeeze on living standards One important theme for the UK economy in 2017 is likely to be the headwinds faced by the household sector in trying to maintain their recent robust rates of real-terms consumption growth. The TUC are worried that workers are heading for a wage squeeze, if pay doesn\u2019t pick up to match rising prices. Today\u2019s figures show that average earnings grew by 2.3% in the June-to-August quarter (see here), but that doesn\u2019t include the impact of inflation. In real terms, regular pay for employees in Great Britain increased by 1.7%, because inflation was 0.6% in August. This chart from the ONS shows how real wage growth peaked in summer 2015, but has fallen back since: We learned yesterday that inflation jumped to 1% in September, and many economists believe it will soon rise over 2%. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady fears that pay packets are going to be eroded by the rising cost of living. Pay growth remains weak by historical standards, and inflation is getting higher. The worry is that families are heading towards another fall in living standards. \u201cWorking people must not be left to pay the price of Brexit through lower wages and higher inflation. The Chancellor must use the Autumn Statement to protect growth and create well-paid work by investing in the construction of roads, railways and homes. And he must protect the living standards of the lowest paid workers by increasing the minimum wage.\u201d Matt Whittaker, Chief Economist at the Resolution Foundation, also fears a pay squeeze: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show that in contrast to the volatility for Sterling, the Brexit vote hasn\u2019t had any immediate impact on the UK labour market, which remains strong and resilient on jobs but disappointing on productivity and pay. \u201cHowever, yesterday\u2019s jump in inflation sounds a warning that unless we see significant step up in pay settlements soon we risk being on course for a fresh pay squeeze next year, having barely recovered from the last one.\u201d This chart, from Resolution, shows how real wages were squeezed for several years after the financial crisis: [Confession: Real wages haven\u2019t actually fallen, as my headline briefly claimed. Apologies for the confusion] David Cheetham, market analyst at XTB.com, points out that today\u2019s data covers the period before the government announced it would trigger the process of leaving the EU in March 2017. Therefore recent issues surrounding a \u201chard\u201d Brexit will not be fairly reflected and any optimism should be carefully checked, with the re-emergence of concerns in recent weeks due to the plummeting value of sterling occurring in a period after which this morning\u2019s release focuses on. The Department for Work and Pensions tweets: There\u2019s no sign of a major Brexit effect on the labour market, says John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC. But, the impact of the EU referendum may show up over the next year. Hawksworth says: \u201cToday\u2019s labour market data suggests some moderation in jobs growth since the EU referendum, but the unemployment rate remains broadly flat so there is no sign yet of major detrimental effects from the Brexit vote. \u201cSpecifically, total employment rose by over 100,000 in the three months to August compared to the previous three months, which is a healthy increase but somewhat slower than the average rate of quarterly jobs growth seen over the past year as a whole. The number of people unemployed also rose by 10,000 over this period, but this reflected growth in the active labour force, so the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.9%. The more timely but less comprehensive unemployment claimant count measure also showed no material change between August and September. \u201cBut it will take time for companies to adjust their hiring plans to the Brexit vote, so we could see some further slowdown in jobs growth over the next year. Here\u2019s the breakdown between full-time and part-time jobs: The number of part-time workers has risen by 198,000 over the last year, to 8.58 million people. Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at The Work Foundation, says this may be a concern. \u201cThere are continued employment gains with people still joining the labour market out of inactivity - though unemployment is slightly up. Most of the employment gains are in part-time employment. This may reflect in part the rise of the gig economy, and is certainly worth monitoring over future months owing to the impact on job security. Concern swelled over the summer over conditions at companies such as Uber and Deliveroo - whose workers went on strike in protest at new pay plans. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, isn\u2019t worried that unemployment rose by 10,000 in the three months to August, to 1.66 million. \u201cThe small rise of 10,000 in UK unemployment in the three months to August is disappointing news but should not be viewed as a \u2018canary in the coalmine\u2019 for any future adverse effect of the Brexit vote. Brexit may yet lead to a weaker jobs market but these latest figure are generally still very strong This chart shows how Britain\u2019s jobless rate is at its lowest for a decade, at just 4.9%. The claimant count rose by 700 people -- but remains historically low. It\u2019s usually a good signal if companies are cutting jobs. Around 560,000 new jobs were created in the last year -- many in the construction sector: But the public sector continues to shrink. It\u2019s been falling steadily since March 2010, There were 5.33 million people employed in the public sector in June 2016, which is the lowest since comparable records began in 1999 And the number of workers from other EU countries rose by 238,000 over the 12 months to June, to 2.23 million. But the number of non-UK nationals from outside the EU working in the UK were little changed at 1.21 million. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway reckons it\u2019s a decent report: But economist Sean Richards is concerned that the unemployment total rose by 10,000 during the quarter. Rupert Seggins believes the labour market remains robust, despite sharp regional differences: The jobs data has driven the pound up by 0.3%, hitting $1.233 for the first time in over a week. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: The UK\u2019s economic data released today has confirmed that the labour market is not showing any sign of weakness \u2013 at least not for now. This has supported the currency which is trading sharply higher. Here are the key points from today\u2019s jobs report (which is online here) There were 31.81 million people in work, 106,000 more than for March to May 2016 and 560,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 23.23 million people working full-time, 362,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 8.58 million people working part-time, 198,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 74.5%, the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.66 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 10,000 more than for March to May 2016 but 118,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 891,000 unemployed men, 12,000 fewer than for March to May 2016 and 81,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 765,000 unemployed women, 23,000 more than for March to May 2016 but 37,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate was 4.9%, unchanged compared with March to May 2016 but down from 5.4% for a year earlier. The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labour force (those in work plus those unemployed) that were unemployed. There were 8.81 million people aged from 16 to 64 who were economically inactive (not working and not seeking or available to work), 65,000 fewer than for March to May 2016 and 231,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The inactivity rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were economically inactive) was 21.5%, the joint lowest since comparable records began in 1971. Regular pay grew by 2.3% in the June-August quarter, up from 2.2% a month ago. That\u2019s better than economists had expected. If you include bonuses, pay also rose by 2.3% - down from 2.4%. Britain\u2019s employment rate is now 74.5% -- the joint highest in over 40 years. And at 4.9%, the jobless rate is at a near 11-year low. Breaking: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has come in at 4.9% in the three months to August. That\u2019s unchanged from last month, suggesting that June\u2019s Brexit vote hasn\u2019t yet hit the labour market. The number of people finding new jobs has swelled by 106,000 in the quarter. That\u2019s slower than in previous quarters (when around 170,000 new jobs were created) but better than expected. And the number of people signing on for unemployment benefits has risen in September, but only by 700 citizens. That\u2019s less than the City feared. More to follow.... Nearly time for the UK unemployment report! Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, predicts that unemployment and wage data will probably be pretty steady. There still is a visible relationship between wage growth and unemployment but it takes a big fall in the latter to get a small rise in the former these days. More likely, is that while the effect of Brexit in the labour market comes (much) later, we get no real clues from these figures. Economists are warning that China\u2019s economy is slowing, even though Beijing met forecasts by posting growth of 6.7% this morning (as flagged in the opening post). China expert Marcus Wright flags up that the building sector is cooling: Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit also points out that China\u2019s housing boom is driving growth, for now... The pound is bobbing just below $1.23 this morning, as the City await the jobs report. And the FTSE 100 has shed 7 points, dragged down by Travis Perkins after it announced its branch closure plan. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says traders are keen to see if UK wage growth has picked up. The headline unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 4.9% for the fourth month in a row \u2013 more pressing will be the wage growth and jobless claims data. The former (when bonuses are included) is expected to sit steady at 2.3%, a figure that could soon be overtaken by inflation given the jump seen yesterday; the latter, meanwhile, is set to climb to 3.4k new claimants across September, the highest addition since May. Laird\u2019s share prices looks like the north face of the Eiger this morning, after that profits warning: Upmarket estate agent Foxtons continues to suffer from the slowdown in London property since the EU referendum. It reported that sales revenue in the last quarter slumped by a third to \u00a312.2m, from \u00a318.5m last year, and blamed: \u201ca continuation of reduced activity in the London property sales market\u201d. Foxtons has previously blamed the EU referendum for dampening demand for houses in London. But, it\u2019s still optimistic about the \u201clong term fundamentals of the London property market\u201d, and has opened seven new branches in the capital this year. So, no escape from those garish minis.... More gloom. Shares in UK electronics firm Laird have almost halved in value, after it hit the City with a profits warning. It is blaming problems at its \u2018performance materials\u2019 division, whose products protect electronic components from heat and electromagnetic interference. Its two biggest customers are Apple and Samsung. CEO Tony Quinlan, chief executive, said: \u201cWe are very disappointed by these adverse developments in the mobile devices market for our Performance Materials division. It now expects to post profits of \u00a350m this year, down from \u00a373.1m last year, and well shy of the \u00a370m which City analysts had pencilled in. According to Laird, it has suffered from a \u201cslower production ramp\u201d \u2013 which I think means its customers haven\u2019t been buying as many components as it expected. Pricing and margin pressures are also very tough, it adds. That may be sign that the smartphone market is cooling. Samsung\u2019s decision to scrap its Galaxy Note 7 may also be hurting Laird. Former CEO David Lockwood quit unexpectedly in August, prompting some brokers to warn that Laird wouldn\u2019t hit its financial forecasts for this year. They\u2019ve been proved right. Britain\u2019s biggest building supplies group, Travis Perkins, has sent a shiver through the sector by announcing plans to shut stores and cut up to 600 jobs. The company is closing 10 distribution and fabrication centres, and 30 branches across its business, having suffered a fall in sales of plumbing and heating products. It warned that the UK outlook was \u2018uncertain\u2019, and said it suffered from volatile demand in July and softer market conditions in August and September. As well as running builders\u2019 merchants, Travis Perkins also owns the Wickes DIY chain. John Carter, chief executive, warned that: It is still too early to predict customer demand in 2017 with certainty and we will continue to monitor our lead indicators closely. Given this uncertainty we will be closing over 30 branches and making further efficiency driven changes in the supply chain, resulting in an exceptional charge of \u00a340-50 million this year. Shares have dropped by 5.5% in early trading, to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Has the Brexit vote cooled Britain\u2019s labour market, or are firms still shrugging off June\u2019s historic referendum? We find out this morning, when the latest unemployment figures are released, covering the period immediately after this summer\u2019s vote. Economists predict that the UK jobless rate remained at just 4.9% in the June-August quarter, with another 70,000 people finding work. But they also expect wage growth to remain subdued at 2.1%, or 2.3% if you chuck in bonuses too. With inflation hitting 1% yesterday, people\u2019s real wages could soon be squeezed. And they also fear that the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose by 3,200 in September, following a 2,400 jump in August. The figures will be eagerly awaited by those who welcome Brexit, and those who fear the consequences of leaving the EU. Until now, firms have stood up to the uncertainty quite well. But the prospect of leaving the single market in 2017 may have a cooling effect soon. Especially as Theresa May has been warned that quitting the EU customs union could wipe out 4.5% of GDP, and bog down Britain\u2019s ports. Also on the agenda: Chinese growth figures, released early today, have shown that its GDP expanded by 6.7% in the last quarter. That\u2019s bang-in-line with estimates (not for the first time), and should reassure investors that China hasn\u2019t suffered a hard landing (yet anyway). Construction helped to drive growth, with real estate investment jumping by 7.1% over the last year and infrastructure spending up by 19.4%. The services sector grew by 7.6%. However, China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics warned that the transition to a consumer-driven economy is challenging, saying: \u201cWe must be aware that economic development is still in a critical period of transformation, with old growth drivers to be replaced by new ones,. With unstable and uncertain domestic and external factors, the foundation for continued economic growth is not solid enough.\u201d So we\u2019ll see how analysts react to that. Also...consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser, building materials group Travis Perkins, electronics group Laird, and confectionary maker Hotel Chocolat are all reporting financial results. And at 6pm, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane is giving a speech at the Cass Busines School. It will cover a new staff paper, also being released at 4pm today, called \u201cQE \u2013 the story so far\u201d. That will be worth checking, given the prime minister\u2019s recent criticism of quantitative easing. We may not get the text of Haldane\u2019s speech, though....",

Interesting of course, in the light of prime minister Theresa May\u2019s criticism of the effects of monetary policy in her Tory party conference speech. Here\u2019s the blurb from the Bank:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the past decade or so, a number of central banks have purchased assets financed by the creation of central bank reserves as a tool for loosening monetary policy \u2013 a policy often known as \u2018quantitative easing\u2019 or \u2018QE\u2019.</p> <p>The first half of the paper reviews the international evidence on the impact on financial markets and economic activity of this policy. It finds that these central bank balance sheet expansions had a discernible and significant impact on financial markets and the economy.</p> <p>The second half of the paper provides new empirical analysis on the macroeconomic impact of central bank balance sheet expansions, across time and countries.</p> <p>It finds three key results. First, it is only when central bank balance sheet expansions are used as a monetary policy tool that they have a significant macro-economic impact. Second, there is evidence for the US that the effectiveness of QE may vary over time, depending on the state of the economy and liquidity of the financial system. And third, QE can have strong spill-over effects cross-border, acting mainly via financial channels. For example, the impact of US QE on UK economic activity may be as large as the impact on US economic activity. </p> </blockquote> <p>The full report can be found here\u201d</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Pages/workingpapers/2016/swp624.aspx\">Staff working paper 624: QE: the story so far</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T15:39:55.879Z\">at 4.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58078da2e4b0cd26ff71ec3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T15:15:00.643Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The rise in the oil price - to its highest since July 2015 - is giving a lift to the FTSE 100 as trading heads towards the close. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The FTSE appears to be following oil prices higher this afternoon, with initial selling giving way to gains into the close. Fears that earnings forecasts were too high have been shown, thus far, to be unproven, with the result that equities have been able to rally once again. This afternoon\u2019s sharp drawdown in crude inventories will be welcomed by oil bulls, with a reduction of 5.2 million barrels confounding market expectations of a second consecutive weekly rise. Lower inventories do not always translate into lower production, yet a smaller amount of oil sloshing about is surely likely to improve the supply and demand dynamic, hence the outperformance of WTI over Brent.</p> </blockquote> <p>The FTSE 100 is currently up around 25 points at 7025, after earlier falling as low as 6975.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T15:58:32.834Z\">at 4.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58078b3ce4b005f21833b136\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T15:07:33.318Z\">4.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Oil price rises on fall in US crude stocks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices are on the rise after new US figures showed a surprise drop in crude stockpiles last week, compared to expectations of an increase.</p> <p>The Energy Information Administration said US crude stocks fell by 5.2m barrels, when analysts had been forecasting a 2.7m rise.</p> <p>The news of increased demand has seen Brent crude climb 2.6% to $53.05 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has jumped 3.2% to $51.93.</p> <p>Earlier crude received some support from renewed hopes that producers would take measures to reduce output, but some were sceptical.

The markets seem comfortable, rather than ecstatic, about his comments including confirmation that the Bank of England will remain independent, and that no conclusion has yet been reached on the exact Brexit deal that will be sought by the UK government. He admitted that there are different opinions in the cabinet over how to approach Brexit, however Hammond and May are reportedly close, so his view could suggest that May\u2019s own view is less severe than she put across at her Party conference.</p> <p>Although the pound has fallen back from its intra-daily highs versus the dollar at 1.2332, Hammond\u2019s comments seem to support the pound/dollar around the 1.23 level. We believe that, on balance, his comments that nothing is set in stone regarding Brexit, is more market-friendly than the \u201chard\u201d Brexit rhetoric that has come from Number 10 in recent weeks.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efd30c7ed0ebcbfd8f7b3ca45d22b57edee5e309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efd30c7ed0ebcbfd8f7b3ca45d22b57edee5e309/4_1_647_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond at the Treasury Committee\" width=\"500\" height=\"278\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Hammond at the Treasury Committee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parliament TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Although Hammond is not giving anything away at this stage of his testimony, it gives the markets a glimmer of hope that the UK may not target a \u201chard\u201d brexit. His opening comments did mention that the current government will bring down net migration to the UK, however, he hasn\u2019t linked this to throwing out access to the EU single market or customs union. This is significant, as it is a softer approach from what the market had perceived from PM Theresa May\u2019s comments at the Tory Party conference at the start of this month.<br></p> <p>Hammond said the government will not pursue the policies outlined by former Chancellor George Osborne in April, which included a further cut to corporation tax, however this was to be expected. Regarding the economic impact from Brexit, the Chancellor said that he would examine the fiscal and economic impact of all Brexit options. From a \u201cRemainer\u2019s\u201d perspective, this seems like a more sensible approach to leaving the European Union, compared to some of the extreme approaches that appeared to disregard the economic impact in favour of reducing immigration.</p> <p>Although Hammond is giving nothing away, his comments may sooth some economic concerns regarding the Brexit process. Overall, his comments so far seem to be supportive of the current recovery in the pound and FTSE 100. But whether or not these gains can be sustained, could depend on this evening\u2019s final US Presidential debate. A win for Clinton could sew up the race for her, which could be a short-term positive for the buck, but may limit further sterling gains.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58077889e4b055209adaf280\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T13:49:28.197Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens mixed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Away from the UK, and US stock markets have struggled for direction in early trading, ahead of the final presidential debate later.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 opened a couple of points higher.

      "bodyText": "Sir Howard Davies, chair of the Airports Commission, has called for a parliamentary vote on airport expansion to be held without delay and reiterated the commission\u2019s preference for a third runway at Heathrow. Speaking at the property conference MIPIM UK in London, Davies also said \u201cthe froth has gone off the London property market\u201d. He said he saw no reason why the House of Commons vote on airport expansion should not go ahead straight away. Theresa May has been accused of \u201cdither and delay\u201d by Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, after putting off the vote for another year, amid worries about resignations of Conservative MPs. \u201cI\u2019m very nervous about a situation which says: \u2018We can\u2019t do something because people will protest.\u2019 We have a democracy in this country,\u201d Davies told investors and developers gathered at the Olympia conference centre. \u201cWe should put it to the House of Commons and see what the vote is, and not take the view that we can\u2019t build an economically rational thing in an environmentally sensible way just because a few people will argue about it. That doesn\u2019t seem to be a sensible way of making policy.\u201d Davies added: \u201cThe arguments point very closely towards Heathrow and post Brexit even more so.\u201d About 70% of tourism at Gatwick airport is outbound while at Heathrow it is the opposite, with 70% of tourism inbound, he said, and Heathrow is the airport that links Britain to markets outside Europe. He was confident that the air pollution issue could be handled, and that the noise issue could be \u201csignificantly mitigated\u201d. The Airports Commission examined three options in a report published last year: a third runway at Heathrow, which was the preferred choice, the extension of an existing runway at Heathrow, or the building of a second runway at Gatwick. Davies, who also chairs Royal Bank of Scotland, said he had heard in his meetings with bankers that a number of banks were preparing to move operations elsewhere in Europe due to fears they could lose access to the single market. \u201cThe London property market may not be quite so buoyant if we had some downsizing of the City,\u201d he warned. Citing a recent report, he said: \u201cIf we have a messy compromise, we could have a 15% fall [in house prices] and in London rather more than that.\u201d The financier Guy Hands, the founder of buyout firm Terra Firma, challenged the notion that the eurozone could claim London\u2019s financial crown, saying US banks were more likely to relocate to New York than Frankfurt or Paris. \u201cIf the financial services business moves out of London, it will move out of Europe and it will affect Europe very negatively indeed,\u201d he said at the same event. Hands, who had favoured the UK remaining in the EU, said Britain now needed to accept hard Brexit and get on with it. Freedom from Brussels was an opportunity to cut taxation and regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s not the referendum that matters, it\u2019s how Britain chooses to go forward.\u201d Hands stressed that \u201cnobody has any real idea of what\u2019s going to happen\u201d to the property market. He did point to Britain\u2019s \u201cchronic housing shortage,\u201d estimated at about 1.2m homes. \u201cIt\u2019s the fundamental problem of social deprivation. Will Brexit change that housing shortage? I don\u2019t think it will.\u201d Addressing the wider economic impact of Brexit, Davies predicted a further rise in inflation, which hit 1% last month, after the referendum sparked a sharp decline in the value of sterling. He also anticipated slower economic growth in the long term, but noted the degree of the slowdown depended on the nature of Brexit. He was doubtful that the weaker pound would boost British exports of goods, noting that \u201cour goods exports are not particularly price sensitive\u201d and that businesses would take a hit from the higher cost of imported materials.",

Ministers were also warned at the Brexit committee that if leaving the customs union meant enhanced border checks, it could clog up Britain\u2019s ports.</p> <p>Many Brexiters assume leaving the customs union is an inevitable result of leaving the EU.

      "bodyText": "Labour MPs are to press the chancellor on the risks of Britain leaving the EU customs union, after the Guardian revealed Whitehall estimates showing it could knock 4.5% off GDP. Philip Hammond, who sees it as part of his role to warn his cabinet colleagues about the risks of Brexit, is to appear before the cross-party Treasury select committee on Wednesday afternoon. Labour MP Helen Goodman, who sits on the committee, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very important that the government has a clear-sighted analysis of the benefits of the customs union, as opposed to treaties with third countries, before deciding on its negotiating strategy. I hope the chancellor will be able to share his thinking with us.\u201d Trade flows and foreign investment would also be hit hard by leaving the customs union, according to figures calculated for the Guardian on the same basis as those prepared by civil servants for the government\u2019s Brexit committee. The pro-EU thinktank Open Britain used the same studies \u2013 by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, the Treasury and the London School of Economics \u2013 to suggest trade could decline by almost 12% and foreign investment by 10%, or more than \u00a34bn, if Britain left the customs union. Foreign investment tends to improve productivity \u2013 a key target for government policy \u2013 so a decline alarms economists. Ministers were also warned at the Brexit committee that if leaving the customs union meant enhanced border checks, it could clog up Britain\u2019s ports. Many Brexiters assume leaving the customs union is an inevitable result of leaving the EU. But the paper, which the Guardian understands was prepared jointly by the Treasury, International Trade and Brexit departments, points out that it would have significant economic costs, even if Britain pursued a Norway-style agreement which would allow it to stay in the European Economic Area. Joe Carberry, of Open Britain, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s own figures show that even under the best case scenario there would be a hit to GDP, trade and investment.\u201d He added: \u201cIf pre-referendum analysis is going to be dismissed, post-referendum analysis should be conducted and published for scrutiny.\u201d Labour also questioned the suggestion made at the Brexirt committee meeting by the secretary for international trade, Liam Fox: that third countries might be willing to continue trading with Britain on existing terms, while new deals were being drawn up. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said: \u201cPolicy decisions cannot be based upon private \u2018gentleman\u2019s agreements\u2019 made off the record by foreign politicians who may or may not still be in office when we need to call them in. \u201cPeople need to know their jobs are being protected and businesses need clarity about the basis of future trade. This government is offering neither.\u201d The paper on the customs union warned ministers that to stand still in trade terms after a withdrawal from the bloc, the UK would need to grow trade with its 10 largest partners outside the EU by 37% by 2030. Fergus McReynolds, EU director of manufacturers\u2019 group the EEF, said: \u201cWhilst the UK is a member of the customs union, manufacturers in the UK have traded with EU partners without experiencing the delays and burden of comprehensive customs controls. In considering the UK future relationship with the EU, the potentially damaging cost implications of delays at these cross-border controls and additional administrative burdens must be fully considered.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Barratt Developments, one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, is engulfed in a corruption scandal after one of its top executives was arrested on suspicion of bribery following an investigation into the awarding of contracts to suppliers. Alastair Baird, Barratt\u2019s regional managing director for London, was arrested on Wednesday by the Metropolitan police after the housebuilder handed over the findings of an internal investigation. He has been suspended from his job at the FTSE 100 company following the arrest. A former Barratt London employee, who has not been named, has also been arrested. The Met confirmed it was investigating \u201ca number of allegations of corruption concerning a public limited company\u201d and that the allegations \u201crelated to irregularities in the tendering process\u201d. The probe is being led by officers in the Met\u2019s complex fraud team, which is part of its Falcon (fraud and linked crime online) division. The Met confirmed it had arrested a 52-year-old man at an address in south Wales on suspicion of bribery and taken him to a police station in the region. A 47-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of bribery in east London and taken to a local police station. The Met said that investigations were ongoing. In a stock market statement, Barratt said it had launched the investigation in August 2015 after an internal audit found \u201cpossible misconduct in the process for awarding and managing certain material and subcontract supply contracts in the London region\u201d. The findings of the investigation were handed to police in April. Barratt said its internal investigation had led to civil legal action against an employee who was dismissed in February, although it did not confirm if this was the same individual who was arrested. Baird has worked for Barratt for 29 years and led the London business, which accounts for more than one in 10 homes built by the company, for the last five years. Barratt\u2019s website describes Baird as a \u201cdynamic leader with a reputation for delivering successful high-value, complex and award-winning urban regeneration scheme\u201d. It adds: \u201cHe is renowned for his superb relationships with key public and private sector stakeholders and his outstanding grasp of the construction and financial issues that underpin successful development.\u201d The chief executive of Barratt, David Thomas, said the housebuilder had \u201cacted decisively\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are committed to meeting the highest ethical standards in all aspects of our business. We have acted decisively, launching our own thorough and comprehensive investigation and referring the matter to the Metropolitan police.\u201d Since the internal inquiry, Barratt said it had appointed an accountancy firm to review its tendering and procurement processes in London. It has now adopted \u201cadditional controls\u201d. The company said its London business had a different procurement process from the rest of the company because of the \u201cnon-standard and one-off nature of London construction projects\u201d. Barratt said Gary Ennis, the head of its southern division, would take control of its London business on a temporary basis. Thomas added: \u201cI am confident that Gary Ennis and the London board will ensure that Barratt London continues to deliver successfully, and remains a trusted, valued partner to its stakeholders. We will continue to co-operate fully with the Metropolitan police and to conduct our own investigation into these matters. We will take whatever action is required to ensure our values and standards are upheld.\u201d Barratt London employs more than 650 people and, according to the company\u2019s website, in the last three years Baird has acquired land to build more than 6,000 homes and which has gross development value \u2013 the potential value of the property after development \u2013 of \u00a33.5bn. Barratt said it did not expect the investigation to have a \u201cmaterial adverse financial effect\u201d. Shares in the company rose 2% on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s labour market was strong in the months leading up to the seismic decision to leave the European Union. Employment was at a record high. There were plenty of vacancies for job seekers. The unemployment rate was below 5%. Fears of an immediate post-referendum shock have so far not been realised. Employment is still rising. There are more than 700,000 job vacancies. The unemployment rate remains below 5%. Some in the remain camp believe Brexit is the biggest policy blunder since Suez in 1956, but it would be hard to draw that conclusion from the labour market data. Employment was up by 106,000 in the three months to August, almost but not quite sufficient to soak up the 116,000 increase in the supply of labour. Despite a 10,000 increase in unemployment, influenced by public sector cuts, the jobless rate was steady at 4.9%. There is nothing in the figures from the Office for National Statistics to suggest that the economy has fallen off a cliff. Indeed, they make a fresh rate cut from the Bank of England next month less likely. It is, though, much too early to sound the all-clear. The quarterly increase in employment was certainly bigger than the financial markets were expecting, but was still smaller than the increases seen earlier in 2016. What\u2019s more, firms will take time to make their post-Brexit plans and there have been some hints \u2013 from the Bank of England\u2019s agents and from the British Chambers of Commerce \u2013 that fewer people will be hired over the coming months. Even a gentle rise in unemployment over the coming months will have an impact on pay. The latest ONS release shows that regular pay in the three months to August was 2.3% higher than in the same three months of 2015. But if workers have only been able to secure wage rises of just over 2% in a year when employment has risen by half a million, it is hard to see why pay awards should be any more generous during a period of heightened post-Brexit uncertainty. During and after the recession of 2008-09, workers sacrificed pay in order to hold on to their jobs, even when sharply higher oil prices meant wages were not keeping pace with inflation.

      "bodyText": "BT shares are among the day\u2019s biggest fallers after two downgrades from analysts and a government comment suggested a break-up of the business was still possible. Regulator Ofcom said in July it would not recommend that BT should sell its Openreach division, which owns the fibre and copper wires which run from local exchanges to homes and businesses, but that it should be run as a legally separate company. But at a broadband conference, minister for digital policy Matt Hancock was asked if BT should be split up to help improve the country\u2019s broadband connections. As reported by Reuters he said \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d and added that no one would get in the way of getting fast fibre-based connectivity. Meanwhile Deutsche Bank issued a sell note on the business and cut its target price by 25p to 345p. It said: BT shares have under-performed year to date and are arguably no longer expensive versus peers. However we view the risk of deteriorating operational newsflow as high, especially in the second half as Virgin Media\u2019s network expansion programme gains momentum, Sky enters the mobile arena, and Vodafone makes deeper in-roads into consumer fixed. Throw in Brexit, macro-economic trends, pension risk and higher capex risk (BT spends less than peers) and we prefer to see BT at a deeper discount to its European peers, which are on balance seeing improving rather than deteriorating operating trends. UBS reduced its target price with a neutral rating, and also pointed to the pension deficit as a concern: Our underlying estimates are broadly unchanged and in-line with consensus estimates. Our price target is trimmed from 425p to 400p, with a 34p cut driven by a widening pension deficit offset by marginal upgrades elsewhere. On regulation, Ofcom has already stated it is not inclined to structurally separate Openreach and will allow BT to decide the financial envelope of the unit going forward. Nevertheless, Ofcom stated structural separation remains an option if there is no resolution on legal separation/corporate governance of Openreach. Separately, the pension deficit for BT is large and growing. On competition, our main concern is rising competition from the Project Lightning footprint rollout by Virgin Media as well as the risk of an EBITDA step down should Liberty Global and Vodafone undertake a broader deal. We estimate the BT pension deficit on an actuarial basis now stands at \u00a314.2bn (versus the \u00a310.0bn disclosed by the Trustees as at June 2015). While a widening of the deficit may seem counterintuitive given the recent rise in gilt yields, yields are still notably lower than June 2015 and inflation assumptions have moved higher recently too. In terms of sensitivities, and at current levels, every 10bp increase on gilt yields is a \u00a3800-900m reduction on the liability and every 10bp increase in the inflation assumption is a near \u00a3700m increase in the liability. After netting off tax at 20% (the tax rate falls to 17% post 2020), the net deficit value in our sum of the parts for BT rises to \u00a311.4bn versus \u00a38.0bn before and leads to a 34p reduction in our [target]. Our pension payment profile in our cash flow forecast is unchanged (-\u00a3255m in 2017 rising to -\u00a3700m per annum thereafter) and the next review by the Trustees is due by March 2018. BT is currently 4.6p or 1.2% lower at 380.05p.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s buoyant jobs market brushed off the Brexit vote in August to maintain its record employment rate of 74.5%, the same as the previous quarter, to take the total number of people with a job to just below 32 million. But analysts said that more than half the 106,000 rise in employment was among part-time workers, reversing a boom in full-time jobs in 2015 and most of this year. A rise in wages, excluding bonuses, to 2.3%, from 2.1% in July, was also played down by business groups, which warned that workers were likely to come under pressure from rising inflation eating into their disposable incomes. The Confederation of British Industry said pay growth remained lacklustre and was under pressure from an inflation rate that hit 1% in September and could rise above 2% next year. The CBI urged ministers to focus their efforts on supporting industry to raise productivity and increase wages, to offset the effects of rising prices. As the debate hots up over the form Britain\u2019s exit from the EU will take, the squeeze on incomes and slowing jobs growth is expected to put the Treasury on the back foot. The strong labour market, which employs more people than at any time since records began in 1971, is considered one of the government\u2019s main achievements. A permanent decline in jobs growth would put pressure on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to introduce more incentives in next month\u2019s autumn statement. The employment minister, Damian Hinds, said the jobs market remained robust after recording a high number of vacancies, rising wages and another month of jobs growth. \u201cIt\u2019s great news for Britain, as the employment rate remains at a record high with more than 31.8 million men and women in work,\u201d he said. The British Chambers of Commerce said the rise in employment was welcome, before warning against complacency after recent surveys of employers showed that businesses had scaled back investment and new hiring. Mike Spicer, the BCC\u2019s director of economics, said it was also important to note that there was the first rise in unemployment for a while and that the rise in employment was smaller than it had been in recent quarters. \u201cThe post-referendum labour-market picture is unlikely to fully emerge for some time, but our own survey data suggests that businesses have lowered their expectations over hiring more staff, and investing,\u201d he said. Echoing the CBI\u2019s message, Spicer added: \u201cNext month\u2019s autumn statement is a great chance for the government to pull out all the stops to support business confidence \u2013 and firms will repay that backing with investment, hiring, training and export growth.\u201d Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the unemployment rate was steady at 4.9%, its lowest since 2005, and jobs vacancies showed no sign of disappearing after the number stayed at 750,000 from July. But employment growth slowed from the 173,000 rise in the three months to July to 106,000 in August. A rise in the number of people unemployed also indicated that employers were becoming wary of holding on to staff in the more uncertain period following the Brexit vote. A total of 24,000 joined the unemployment register in August from July, compared with a previous quarter-on-quarter rise of 10,000. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s interest-rate-setting committee, said the rise in unemployment showed cracks were appearing in the labour market data. He said the rise in wages had also failed to push take home pay above its pre-crash peak once inflation was taken into account. Real total pay of \u00a3364 a week was still 7.7% below the level seen in February 2007, when it stood at \u00a3386, said Blanchflower. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Global Insight, struck a similar tone, saying: \u201c[Business] surveys have also indicated a waning in the hiring trend, and suggest that we\u2019re likely to see a more severe weakening of the official labour market data in coming months. \u201cThe REC recruitment industry survey shows the number of people placed in permanent jobs by agencies has slowed markedly in recent months, down to levels that are consistent with unemployment rising, albeit rebounding somewhat in September from the low seen in July. \u201cSimilarly, PMI [purchasing managers\u2019 index] survey data indicate that employment growth remains stunted compared with earlier in the year, amid widespread anxiety about committing to new hires, given the uncertain political and economic outlook,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are pausing for breath after China\u2019s economy grew in line with expectations, and ahead of the final US presidential debate. Disappointing results from Travis Perkins and Reckitt Benckiser have helped undermine any gains the market might have been contemplating, so the FTSE 100 is down 15.50 points at 6984.56. Unemployment and average earnings figures have had little impact so far. Travis Perkins is the biggest FTSE 100 faller, down just over 5% at \u00a314.10 as the builders merchants group warned on 2016 profits and said it would close 30 branches putting 600 jobs at risk. But Reckitt is close behind, falling 250p to \u00a370.77. The Dettol to Nurofen to Durex business reported a bigger than expected slowdown in third quarter like for like sales growth, up just 2% compared to expectations of a 2.8% rise. Including currency movements reported sales rose 17% as the slump in the pound boosted overseas revenues. But it reported disappointing sales in Europe and North America, especially for new Scholl products, and continuing weakness in Russia. Its Korean business fell back after its handling of a scandal involving the death of 92 people. The company said if the performance in the fourth quarter was the same as the third, it would not make its full year targets. It would not comment on the impact of sterling\u2019s fall on pricing in the UK. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The group\u2019s image has been seriously damaged in Korea after it recently accepted a RB product was responsible for spate of fatal lung problems. The inevitable slowdown there was enough to dent group sales. Having already set aside \u00a3300m for the issue, investors will hope that there are no further charges to come in relation to the tragic episode. Declining sales in Korea might have been expected, but today\u2019s results also confirm weaker trends in other areas. While the disappointing performance from the latest Scholl products may not be the end of the world, the group will hope for improvements in the future. But Burberry is 31p better at \u00a314.34 after positive analyst comment after its falls after Tuesday\u2019s update. Barclays raised its target price from \u00a313.50 to \u00a314.50, saying: Expectations were running high coming into the figures following LVMH results last week - so in line figures have been met with some disappointment with the stock down high single-digits. We have raised both the EPS and price target by 7% based on 19 times 2017 calendar PE. UBS was also positive, issuing a buy note: Although expectations on Burberry had been high into the quarter, we believe that the share price weakness (-7%) was an overreaction given in line figures and no change to consensus pretax profit excluding foreign exchange. Our buy rating on Burberry is based on our view that the share price does not reflect the true value of the retail productivity improvements and cost savings plan laid out at the strategy update on 18th May. We believe that the return to positive like for like of +2% in the second quarter should give confidence in this longer term potential. Additionally we were positively surprised that cost control measures will now come in above expectations for both the full year and the first half so offsetting the downgrade in wholesale guidance. Mining companies are also generally higher after the Chinese GDP figures reassured investors about the country\u2019s economic outlook. Anglo American has added 25.5p to \u00a310.55 and Rio Tinto has risen 2p to 2617.5p. But BHP Billiton has slipped 5p to \u00a312.07 as it met analysts expectations for iron ore and petroleum production, but disappointed on coal. Among the mid-caps Apple-supplier Laird has slumped nearly 50% to 160.8p after a shock profit warning. Analyst Nick James at Numis said: Laird has warned that 2016 profit will be around 36% short of our expectations, with pretax profit now expected to be around \u00a350m (Num \u00a377m). This is despite an incremental foreign exchange tailwind of around \u00a35m to pretax profit since we cut estimates at the interims. The huge shortfall is attributed to the Performance Materials division, where volumes, pricing and margins at Apple appear to be well short of expectations. Given recent Apple supply chain data is suggesting solid end demand for iPhone7, the issues appear to be Laird specific. We cut earnings per share by 36% in 2016 to 14.3p from 22.2p and by 39% in 2017 to 15.5p from 25.5p. Sentiment and confidence in forecasts will clearly be significantly dented and we place recommendation under review. Net debt should still be within covenants at year end (Num 3.2 times versus covenant at 3.5 times), although the balance sheet also now comes into focus.",

      "bodyText": "A leading MP in the investigation into the collapse of BHS believes there is little Sir Philip Green can do to justify keeping his knighthood. Frank Field, the co-chair of the parliamentary inquiry into the retailer\u2019s demise, was speaking before Thursday\u2019s House of Commons debate on whether Green should be stripped of his knighthood. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 in 2015 to investors led by a former bankrupt, Dominic Chappell. The administrators were called in in April this year, later leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a \u00a3571m pension black hole. Field told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe key thing was coming up with a generous pension settlement, but he\u2019s never done so. The flavour of this would change if he put concrete proposals which insured that the pensioners were better off than they are now, heading for the pension protection fund, that would help. \u201cWhether in fact \u2013 given the views now in the country which might be expressed on Thursday in the House of Commons - it\u2019s possible to save his knighthood is clearly another matter.\u201d It is understood that the debate will not automatically lead to a vote among MPs, but will be subject to the Speaker\u2019s approval. If MPs did vote to strip Green of his prestigious title, it would be \u201cpersuasive\u201d only. The forfeiture committee makes its decisions independently although the prime minister could make a recommendation. Field and Green have repeatedly clashed through the course of the parliamentary investigation into the well-known high street retailer. In a report concluding the investigation, MPs accused Green of \u201cplundering\u201d BHS, systematically taking money out of the business, leaving it on the brink of collapse and the pension fund in deficit. Green, however, said the report contained factual and legal errors and claims he did everything possible to keep the business from going going under. He said on Tuesday that he was \u201csad and very sorry\u201d for the hardship caused by the collapse of BHS and said he was in \u201cvery strong dialogue\u201d with the pensions regulator to find a solution to the pensions black hole.",

      "bodyText": "Members of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors \u2013 who between them own approximately 10% of the average ASX200 company \u2013 will start voting against sitting company directors whose boards are full of men. The policy was developed by the council in collaboration with its members, and will see companies which have not taken steps to address their lack of female directors by 2017 face votes against sitting directors. ACSI\u2019s policy is reaching 30% women on ASX200 boards by 2017. Council CEO Louise Davidson told Guardian Australia that members were \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to backing the policy. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking to boards about the lack of women for a long time, probably for the past five years,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019re backing that talk with action and a policy that advises members about the election of directors to boards that have shown little improvement in their female representation or which have no women represented on them at all.\u201d A letter sent by the council to its members reads, \u201c... where the council believes that a company has demonstrated no progress in either changing the make-up of its board, or in presenting a clear plan to achieve that 30% target, it will begin recommending that its members oppose the re-election of existing directors\u201d. The council is now speaking to other companies and encouraging them to implement similar policies, Davidson said. \u201cWe are not the only organisation to see the value in increased board diversity but in the face of multiple campaigns, some boards are just not getting the message and are now seriously out of step with their peers,\u201d she said. Seventeen ASX200 companies still have no women on their boards, and 63 have just one female director. Meanwhile, 57 companies have reached or exceeded the 30% target and another 52 have 25%-29% female representation on their boards. The council\u2019s move follows an announcement last month from the minister for women, Michaelia Cash, that the government had set a target of women holding 50% of government board positions overall. It marked the most ambitious target the government had set for female representation on boards, with the previous target set at 40%. The proportion of female government board directors hit 40.5% at the end of June, prompting the revised target. A white paper from UN Women found that men were not being appointed to boards more frequently because they were more qualified than women but because of a flawed process of merit which saw a range of biases discriminate against women and other diverse groups. The paper was backed by a report released in August by Chief Executive Women and Male Champions of Change which cited research which found the more an organisation described itself as a meritocracy, the greater the bias from managers towards men over equally-qualified women. \u201cMany studies confirm that we are drawn to those who think, look and act like us,\u201d the report found. \u201cThis is a problem for women working in male-dominated environments where there are deeply held beliefs and norms about who is suitable for leadership. Research has found that gender bias persists in many organisations, and even more so in self-labelled \u2018meritocracies\u2019.\u201d",

Meanwhile, 57 companies have reached or exceeded the 30% target and another 52 have 25%-29% female representation on their boards.</p> <p>The council\u2019s move follows <a href=\"http://the https://www.theguardian.com.au/story/4196060/minister-for-women-michaelia-cash-oversees-department-with-lowest-female-representation-on-government-boards/\">an announcement last month</a> from the minister for women, Michaelia Cash, that the government had set a target of women holding 50% of government board positions overall. </p> <p>It marked the most ambitious target the government had set for female representation on boards, with the previous target set at 40%. The proportion of female government board directors hit 40.5% at the end of June, prompting the revised target.<br></p> <p>A <a href=\"https://unwomen.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Re-thinking-Merit-Whitepaper.pdf\">white paper </a>from UN Women found that men were not being appointed to boards more frequently because they were more qualified than women but because of a flawed process of merit which saw a range of biases discriminate against women and other diverse groups.</p> <p>The paper was backed by a report released in August by Chief Executive Women and Male Champions of Change which cited research which found the more an organisation described itself as a meritocracy, the greater the bias from managers towards men over equally-qualified women.</p> <p>\u201cMany studies confirm that we are drawn to those who think, look and act like us,\u201d the report found.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is a problem for women working in male-dominated environments where there are deeply held beliefs and norms about who is suitable for leadership.
