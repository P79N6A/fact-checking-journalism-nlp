      "bodyText": "Financial markets have a lot of faith in Mario Draghi. Too much faith, in all likelihood. They rallied last summer when the president of the European Central Bank said he would do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro. And they rallied on Thursday when the ECB cut interest rates to 0.5%. Bond yields fell across the eurozone, hitting record lows in France and dropping below 10% in Greece. Stock markets liked the news, too. But did the news warrant the upbeat response? Not really. Let's be clear, the reduction in the cost of borrowing for the eurozone was welcome. It was also signalled in advance, long overdue, and the bare minimum that the ECB could have delivered when recession is deepening quarter by quarter and Japanese-style deflation appears to be just around the corner. Draghi hinted that the ECB might consider negative deposit rates, which would mean that banks would have to pay for the privilege of parking money at Europe's central bank. That threat, it is hoped, will encourage banks to lend rather than hoard their cash. And he said the ECB would consult with the European Investment Bank and the European commission about the possibility of measures that could boost credit flows to small- and medium-sized companies. By no stretch of the imagination does this amount to a rescue plan for a eurozone facing a second calendar year of declining output and with unemployment at a record 12.1% and rising. The Bank of England had its Funding for Lending Scheme in place by the middle of 2012; the ECB is still at the drawing board stage. This is perhaps not surprising. The ECB is a conservative institution, although it has become less so under Draghi's stewardship. Its freedom of action is constrained by Germany's insistence that the problems of the troubled countries of the eurozone are caused by the lack of structural reform, and not insufficient demand. It was clear from Draghi's press conference that the decision was not unanimous and it did not take a genius to surmise that Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, was a dissenting voice. So why are markets so chipper? We can rule out the idea that the ECB's rate cut will prompt a recovery in output. (Although it may help, at the margin, to underpin consumer and business confidence.) The decline in Greek bond yields suggests that the markets believe the risks of a break-up of the single currency have markedly diminished since Draghi issued his \"whatever it takes\" reassurance in July 2012. The immediate threat to monetary union is certainly diminished, but it is a heroic assumption \u2013 given the deepening slump, the recurrent sovereign debt crises and the structural differences between rich and poor countries \u2013 to imagine that the risk of break-up has disappeared altogether. No, what we are really witnessing here is a touching belief in the ability and willingness of central banks to prevent investors suffering losses. In the early part of the last decade there was something known as the Greenspan put: every time Wall Street was in trouble, the chairman of the Federal Reserve would ride to the rescue with a cut in interest rates. In 2013 we have the Bernanke put, the King put and now the Draghi put. Bad economic news is treated by the markets as good economic news, because they believe lower interest rates or more quantitative easing will follow. Eventually one of two things happens: the recovery actually does arrive. Or reality sets in.",

    "webTitle": "Bob Diamond: I wasn't in banking for the money", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond, the former boss of Barclays who made \u00a398m in six years, has insisted he never worked for money and that his vast rewards were merely the result of his hard work. Speaking for the first time since he was ousted by the bank nine months ago in the wake of the Libor rate-rigging scandal, Diamond also questioned whether the Bank of England's governor, Sir Mervyn King, had the authority to force him out of his job last July, days after the bank was fined \u00a3290m for rigging Libor. \"This is going to sound arrogant as hell but I never did anything for money. I never set money as a goal. It was a result,\" Diamond said in an interview with the New York Times magazine to be published on Sunday. The banker known as Red, after his initials, was at the centre of a row over his \u00a32.7m bonus for 2012 in the months before he quit. The bank was faced with a shareholder rebellion in protest at his proposed payout. Diamond eventually accepted tweaks to the deal in an attempt to head off a major revolt. Once branded \"the unacceptable face of banking\" by Lord Mandelson, he told the New York Times, which published pictures of him travelling on the New York subway, that he was not money-motivated, and that he did not have a flash car or any of the other trappings of wealth. Diamond said he only had an old Jeep at his holiday home in Nantucket, near Cape Cod. He also has homes in Beaver Creek, the ski resort in Colorado, and a \u00a325m penthouse apartment on the 40th floor of 15 Central Park West, a New York complex that is also home to pop star Sting and the Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein. He bought the apartment under the name Novgorod to avoid his identity being revealed. Since giving evidence to the Treasury select committee the day after his resignation, Diamond has said little in public, apart from giving the occasional lecture at Yale. However, he reveals that he wants to get back into banking, working with big companies. In the interview, Diamond recalled how the then Barclays chairman Marcus Agius arrived at his London home on a Monday evening in July to tell him that King wanted him out. \"My first reaction, which is still my reaction today, is, he [King] doesn't have the authority to do that!\" Diamond said. The 61-year-old American-born banker said he discussed the matter with his wife, Jennifer, with whom he has three children, and concluded that the best thing he could do for Barclays was \"step aside and shut up\". To underline his claim that he had not worked for money, Diamond, who is also a British citizen, said he had set up a family charity, which supports education projects, after he had started to make money. \"If you look at how Jennifer and I and our three kids have lived our lives, as soon as we had any money at all, we created a family foundation \u2026 I think Jennifer and I have always had a great home for our kids. We really like to take vacations with them, so those are good. But we don't have a boat, we don't have fancy cars. I think we have lived well, but it hasn't been about accumulation or anything like that.\" Shortly after he quit, his daughter Nell tweeted her support, saying: \"George Osborne and Ed Miliband you can go ahead and #HMD [hold my dick]\". Diamond said she had called him to say she had done \"something really bad, I think I'm in trouble\", to which he said he replied: \"Sweetie, I love you. That's so nice. I think we're probably all in trouble.\" He told the New York Times that he did not know much about Libor. \"Do you want the truth? Up until all of this, I didn't even know the mechanics of how Libor was set. If you asked me who at Barclays submitted the rate every day, I wouldn't be able to tell you. I bet you if you asked any chief executive of any bank on the street, they would give you the same answer.\" Days after Diamond took the top job at Barclays, in January 2011, he stoked anger when he told MPs that the time for bankers to show remorse for the near-collapse of the banking system was over. In the interview he admitted that he had underestimated how he had been perceived in the UK, but insisted that leaving had been \"very positive and kind of liberating\". \"Do I think I was tone-deaf to the American thing?\" he said. \"Probably. I think that the anger against banks and bankers, particularly in the UK, was deeper than I realised.\"",

It was a result,\" Diamond said <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/magazine/robert-diamonds-next-life.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">in an interview with the New York Times</a> magazine to be published on Sunday.</p> <p>The banker known as Red, after his initials, was at the centre of a row over his \u00a32.7m bonus for 2012 in the months before he quit. The bank was faced with a shareholder rebellion in protest at his proposed payout. Diamond eventually accepted tweaks to the deal in an attempt to head off a major revolt.</p> <p>Once branded \"the unacceptable face of banking\" by Lord Mandelson, he told the New York Times, which published pictures of him travelling on the New York subway, that he was not money-motivated, and that he did not have a flash car or any of the other trappings of wealth. Diamond said he only had an old Jeep at his holiday home in Nantucket, near Cape Cod. He also has homes in Beaver Creek, the ski resort in Colorado, and a \u00a325m penthouse apartment on the 40th floor of 15 Central Park West, a New York complex that is also home to pop star Sting and the Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein. He bought the apartment under the name Novgorod to avoid his identity being revealed.</p> <p>Since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/04/libor-bob-diamond\" title=\"\">giving evidence to the Treasury select committee</a> the day after his resignation, Diamond has said little in public, apart from giving the occasional lecture at Yale. However, he reveals that he wants to get back into banking, working with big companies.</p> <p>In the interview, Diamond recalled how the then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/02/barclays-chairman-marcus-agius-resigns\" title=\"\">Barclays chairman Marcus Agius</a> arrived at his London home on a Monday evening in July to tell him that King wanted him out.</p> <p>\"My first reaction, which is still my reaction today, is, he [King] doesn't have the authority to do that!\" Diamond said.</p> <p>The 61-year-old American-born banker said he discussed the matter with his wife, Jennifer, with whom he has three children, and concluded that the best thing he could do for Barclays was \"step aside and shut up\".</p> <p>To underline his claim that he had not worked for money, Diamond, who is also a British citizen, said he had set up a family charity, which supports education projects, after he had started to make money. \"If you look at how Jennifer and I and our three kids have lived our lives, as soon as we had any money at all, we created a family foundation \u2026 I think Jennifer and I have always had a great home for our kids. We really like to take vacations with them, so those are good. But we don't have a boat, we don't have fancy cars. I think we have lived well, but it hasn't been about accumulation or anything like that.\"</p> <p>Shortly after he quit, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/03/bob-diamonds-daughter-tweets\" title=\"\">his daughter Nell tweeted her support</a>, saying: \"George Osborne and Ed Miliband you can go ahead and #HMD [hold my dick]\". Diamond said she had called him to say she had done \"something really bad, I think I'm in trouble\", to which he said he replied: \"Sweetie, I love you. That's so nice. I think we're probably all in trouble.\"</p> <p>He told the New York Times that he did not know much about Libor. \"Do you want the truth? Up until all of this, I didn't even know the mechanics of how Libor was set. If you asked me who at Barclays submitted the rate every day, I wouldn't be able to tell you. I bet you if you asked any chief executive of any bank on the street, they would give you the same answer.\"</p> <p>Days after Diamond took the top job at Barclays, in January 2011, he stoked anger when he told MPs that the time for bankers to show remorse for the near-collapse of the banking system was over. In the interview he admitted that he had underestimated how he had been perceived in the UK, but insisted that leaving had been \"very positive and kind of liberating\".</p> <p>\"Do I think I was tone-deaf to the American thing?\" he said. \"Probably. I think that the anger against banks and bankers, particularly in the UK, was deeper than I realised.\"</p>",

The FSA advertised this week for a replacement for Rooker (who is stepping down in July at the end of his four-year contract. Smith informed the FSA he was looking for a new job in May last year, when it took steps to avoid any perception \"of improper influence or advantage\". Three members of the FSA executive started monitoring his actions to ensure he was continuing to \"work in the public interest and was not engaged in areas of business where that might be a potential for a perceived conflict of interest regarding a future employer\". He told the FSA he had received a job offer from Tesco in July 2012 and was asked by the board to step back from his responsibilities in August 2012. Smith continuing receiving \u00a3140,000 salary until he left in October. He also received a performance bonus of \u00a312,500 in July 2012. Tesco said: \"Tim Smith was appointed to his role as group technical director at Tesco in accordance with the rules set out by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. Tim Smith is fully aware of these rules and has abided by them throughout his time at Tesco.\"",

    "webTitle": "Eurozone interest rates cut to a record low of 0.5%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has delivered an emergency quarter-point cut in interest rates \u2013 but its president, Mario Draghi, has cautioned governments in the recession-hit eurozone against \"unravelling\" their austerity policies. The ECB's governing council on Wednesday announced the first cut in borrowing costs since July 2012, reducing interest rates to a record low of 0.5%. The bank's policy meeting in Bratislava came to its decision against a backdrop of weak economic data, including unemployment across the 17 member countries of the single currency hitting a record high of more than 12%. The euro fell more than 1% against the dollar to $1.304 in the wake of Draghi's comments. The ECB president also suggested that the ECB would consider imposing a negative interest rate on deposits held at the central bank, to prevent banks parking money at the ECB instead of lending it out to companies. The ECB's deposit rate already stands at zero. Explaining the bank's decision to cut rates in his regular press conference, Draghi pointed out that GDP across the eurozone has now declined for five consecutive quarters, and that \"weak economic sentiment has extended into spring of this year\". However, Draghi urged policymakers to keep faith with austerity amid a fierce debate in Europe about whether crisis-hit countries should be allowed to ease up on their drastic deficit-reduction plans. \"In order to bring debt ratios back on a downward path, euro area countries should not unravel their efforts to reduce government budget deficits and continue, where needed, to take legislative action or otherwise promptly implement structural reforms, in such a way as to mutually reinforce fiscal sustainability and economic growth potential,\" he said. David Brown of New View Economics said: \"The ECB rate cut is no surprise as it was well flagged by Draghi at last month's meeting. Is it enough? No. The marginal effect of the cut is very limited, but at least it should have some symbolic rallying effect on economic confidence\". However, the ECB dashed hopes that it would announce a detailed set of policies to unblock lending to small businesses, which are often unable to access bank lending at affordable rates, particularly in the eurozone's bailed-out peripheral economies. Instead, Draghi said he would \"start consultations with other European institutions on initiatives to promote a functioning market for asset-backed securities collateralised by loans to non-financial corporations.\" That might allow banks to bundle up loans to small businesses and exchange them for more liquid assets with the ECB \u2013 but Draghi gave few details of how such a scheme might work. He also refused to say whether the rate decision had been unanimous, insisting instead that there had been a strong consensus in favour of a cut. ECB-watchers took that as a signal that there may have been some dissenters, perhaps including Bundesbank governor Jens Weidmann. German chancellor Angela Merkel, who is running for re-election in September, recently cast doubt on the need for a reduction in rates, saying German savers would benefit from a higher rate instead. But the ECB has become increasingly concerned about a credit crunch in some of the eurozone's struggling peripheral states, with funding for firms drying up. Draghi said he was \"frustrated\" that banks were not lending more, adding that the ECB could only use the tools it has available. \"We can't just throw money out of helicopters. We have to go via the banking system,\" he said, in a reference to the famous comment by the economist Milton Friedman \u2013 recently picked up by US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke \u2013 that in if central banks really wanted to deal with deflation they could drop bundles of banknotes out of a helicopter. A fall in inflation, to 1.2%, in April \u2013 well below the ECB's ceiling of 2% \u2013 helped make room for Thursday's reduction in borrowing costs. Howard Archer of consultancy IHS Global Insight said: \"The ECB's decision to cut interest rates to 0.5% had looked ever more inevitable as latest data and survey evidence pointed to ongoing and widespread economic weakness across the eurozone as well as below-target and receding inflation.\" Financial markets had been betting on a rate cut since the ECB's last meeting in April, when Draghi used his regular press conference to promise that he would be \"closely monitoring\" economic developments. He repeated the phrase, often seen as code for a forthcoming rate cut, at Thursday's briefing, apparently leaving the door open for a fresh reduction if the economic outlook deteriorates in the coming months. German output Factory activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy and the world's second biggest exporter after China, fell for the second month in March \u2013 and at a faster pace. The worsening situation, following a slump in demand for industrial goods in China and declining car sales across the eurozone, also hit France, Italy and Spain, cutting output and undermining their prospects for growth. German industrial bellwether Siemens said demand would remain weak for the rest of the year, hitting profits. The company, which makes products ranging from fast trains and gas turbines to hearing aids, would need to write off some sales, reflecting a slowdown in China, weak demand from a fragile US economy and a eurozone mired in recession. Markit's eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to a four-month low of 46.7 last month from March's 46.8. New business for factories, which recovered strongly after the banking crash, has fallen for nearly two years, with the orders coming in at 45.4, just a notch above March's 45.3. A figure blow 50 indicates contraction. Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, said: \"There is nothing here to suggest that manufacturing will turn the corner and stabilise any time soon, putting greater onus on policymakers to act quickly to reinvigorate growth.\"",

No companies have so far suffered a defeat at an AGM in 2013, in contrast to last year's shareholder spring when a record number of remuneration reports where voted down in protests against inflated pay. \"Companies have changed their approach this year and the quid pro quo is that shareholders are less likely to oppose them,\" Powdrill said. \"But there are still a lot of problems out there.\" Inmarsat said in a statement: \"The remuneration committee has noted the vote against the remuneration report. Taking into account the company's performance and following extensive and on-going engagement with shareholders, the Remcom believes it has correctly aligned remuneration of the executive directors with the interests of shareholders.\"",

    "webTitle": "Shell chief Peter Voser stands down as oil company posts profit rise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Peter Voser, the chief executive and architect of Shell's recent financial success, has unexpectedly announced plans to stand down, less than four years into the job. The move came as the Anglo-Dutch oil group unveiled a 4% increase, to $8bn (\u00a35bn), in its first quarter profits and raised the dividend a further 5% to 45 cents per share. 54-year old Voser said he wanted a \"change of lifestyle\" and to spend more time with his family. He is scheduled to retire from Shell in the first half of next year with a pension pot worth almost $20m. There was immediate speculation he may be lined up for the job of chairman at Swiss pharmacuetical group Roche, where he is already a non-executive director. Meanwhile current chief financial officer, Simon Henry, said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment on whether he would try to follow Voser's path from finance to the top job. If Henry takes over he would be the first British boss of Shell since Philip Watts left in 2004 in the wake of a scandal over the wrong booking of oil reserves. Voser, 54, has spent almost 25 years in total at Royal Dutch Shell, having left in the middle of his career there only to return later. On Thursday he said: \"After such an exciting executive career I feel it is time for a change in my lifestyle and I am looking forward to have more time available for my family and private life,\" he said. Shell's chairman, Jorma Ollila, said Voser's reign over the past four years had been \"impressive\", reorganising the company, delivering growth, and developing a clear forward strategy with a strong portfolio of new options. Analysts generally agreed. Peter Hutton, energy analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note that the quarerly results were \"solid\" and he was full of praise for the outgoing chief executive. \"Peter Voser leaves Shell in a much stronger position than when he arrived. The company still needs to steer through LNG optionality to bring greater clarity, in our view, but he has brought real focus to the business. The testament to a strong legacy will be a smooth transition to his successor. Neill Morton at Investec Securities added that Voser's exit was a surprise: \"He is only 54 years old and Shell is portraying this is as a lifestyle choice.\" Shell also reported revenues of $115bn in the first three months of 2013, roughly as much as the cost of running the NHS until the end of the year. The $115bn revenues recorded by Shell were lower than the almost $120bn for the same quarter of 2012, although that was restated for accounting reasons. Oil and gas production rose 2% to 3.5m barrels of oil equivalents \u2013 but that was excluding the impact of divestments, production sharing agreements and security problems onshore Nigeria. Voser said the company had also spent $1.2bn buying back its shares in the last quarter. The company has benefited from strong crude prices, although the global price of oil has in recent days fallen through the $100 a barrel level. This was exacerbated by weak manufacturing data from the US and China, prompting fears of a downturn in the global economy. On a media conference call, Henry said the company was well placed for the recent fall in prices. \"We also think there are quite few players in the market, quite a few companies, who actually have bet the farm on 64.2 pounds-plus oil prices. We don't,\" he said. \"We're structured around a lower oil price so it is not bad for us,\" he added. Henry indicated that the lower oil prices might drive down asset values and give opportunities for takeovers. Shell has periodically been linked with a purchase of BP whose share price has continued to lag because of fallout from the US Gulf oil blowout. But Simon said: \"We dont look at larger companies because they come with a smorgasbord of assets that we don't want ... [we are] more focused on smaller companies.\" Shell said it was pressing ahead with shale drilling from China to Argentina but was not currently thinking about fracking in Britain or Europe.",

    "webTitle": "Mario Draghi urges no let-up in austerity reforms after eurozone rate cut - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That's all for today, as Mario Draghi and crew head back to Frankfurt after a lively, and significant, meeting in Bratislava. As my colleague Heather Stewart writes: The European Central Bank has delivered an emergency quarter-point cut in interest rates but its president Mario Draghi cautioned governments in the recession-hit eurozone against \"unravelling\" their austerity policies . The ECB's governing council announced the first cut in borrowing costs since July 2012, reducing interest rates to a record low of 0.5%.The bank's policy meeting in Bratislava made its decision against a backdrop of weak economic data including unemployment across the 17 member countries of the single currency hitting a record high of more than 12% The euro fell more than 1% against the dollar to $1.304 in the wake of Draghi's comments. The ECB president also suggested that the ECB would consider imposing a negative interest rate on deposits held at the central bank, to prevent banks parking money at the ECB instead of lending it out to firms. The ECB's deposit rate already stands at zero. Explaining the bank's decision to cut rates in his regular press conference, Draghi pointed out that GDP across the eurozone has now declined for five consecutive quarters, and, \"weak economic sentiment has extended into spring of this year\". However, Draghi urged policymakers to keep faith with austerity amid a fierce debate in Europe about whether crisis-hit countries should be allowed to ease up on their drastic deficit-reduction plans. \"In order to bring debt ratios back on a downward path, euro area countries should not unravel their efforts to reduce government budget deficits and continue, where needed, to take legislative action or otherwise promptly implement structural reforms, in such a way as to mutually reinforce fiscal sustainability and economic growth potential,\" he said. Heather's full story is online here. And you can follow full highlights of the press conference from 1.30pm In other news... \u2022 The Italian prime minister, Enrico Letta, has called for more action on youth unemployment (see 12pm) \u2022 Eurozone manufacturing output has fallen again, driven by a drop in production in Germany (see 9.31am).. \u2022 But Germany's slump has slowed (see 9.45am). \u2022 And in Germany, the Neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party was blocked from using Syntagma Square for its 'Greeks only' food handouts (see 10.27am). I'll be back tomorrow for another day of rolling eurozone developments, and the excitement of the monthly US jobs data. Until then, thank you and goodnight! European sovereign bonds have rallied pretty strongly today, pushing down bond yields deeper into 'safe haven' territory. Here's a selection of 10-year bond yields: \u2022 Germany: 1.16% \u2022 France: 1.65% \u2022 UK: 1.62% \u2022 Italy: 3.76% \u2022 Spain 4.03% \u2022 Greece: 10.2% (having dipped below 10% earlier) I wonder if these low bond yields were on Mario Draghi's mind earlier today, when he urged eurozone governments not to abandon their fiscal plans. Will such low borrowing costs embolden leaders in Italy and Madrid to push back harder against Brussels this summer? Europe's stock markets finished the day in mixed mood, although there's a decent little rally on Wall Street this afternoon. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 9 points at 6460, + 0.15% \u2022 German DAX: up 48 points at 7961, + 0.6% \u2022 French CAC: up 2 points at 3858, + 0.05% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 12 points at 8406, -0.15% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 19 points at 16748, - 0.12% And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones is currently up 111 points at 14812, +0.78%, after General Motors and other big companies announced higher profits. Forgot to mention this earlier, but the ECB announced this afternoon that it is prepared to accept Cyprus's sovereign debt as collateral in its refinancing operations (the statement is here). That is part of Cyprus's 'rehabilitation' now that its bailout programme has been agreed. Pawel Swidlicki of Open Europe, though, suspects trouble: Here's Michael Hewson of CMC Markets on the ECB rate decision, and press conference: The admission that the governing council was keeping an open mind on negative deposit rates, in spite of the risks, was not expected... and precipitated a sharp sell-off in the euro currency, and a little bit of choppiness in equity markets. Any expectation of some non-standard measures to help kick start lending to small businesses was left disappointed with only a nod to a continued discussion about any conclusions as to how to help SME lending. While Draghi expressed his concerns about the weak economic outlook, he was keen to impress on other EU countries that they should continue to press on with the currently agreed reform programs in remarks clearly aimed at the governments in France and Italy. The euro continues to slide, now down 1% or 1.3 cents against the US dollar at $1.304. Greek bonds have risen in value today to the point where its 10-year bond yields dipped below the 10% mark this afternoon. Quite a recovery - given these bonds were trading at yields around 30% last June, even after Greece wrote of a substantial chunk of its debts (the vertical line last March): The recovery reflects the perception that Greece is no longer at risk of plunging out of the eurozone anytime soon (the chatter these days is about Cyprus, Italy or even Germany quitting - for one reason or another). And some analysts do see encouraging signs in the Greek economy. The economy is still contracting, but after five years of recession there is hope that GDP will start growing in 2014. At some point, the theory goes, the fiscal rebalancing (with its painful wage and benefit reductions and tough cuts to government spending) must translate into a more competitive economy. Even within the single currency. As covered at 9.45am, the slump in Greece's factory sector slowed down last month. And yesterday, it began its privatisation programme by selling a \u20ac652m stake in a betting firm. That's not as much as Athens had hoped - but it's a start..... Mario Draghi has been signing the new \u20ac5 note for a group of young people, all born since the euro was created, while the European anthem rang out. Draghi was in ebullient mood, calling euro notes: ...the most visible and tangible symbol of European integration, used from one end of the continent to the other. Just don't try taking too many out of Cyprus at once. Draghi added: The children who are here today are growing up in a continent of peace. They belong to the \u201ceuro generation\u201d \u2013 they have only known one currency. And the Telegraph's Bruno Waterfield kindly provides a photo: As promised earlier - here's a link to the statement from Mario Draghi this afternoon. Mario Draghi's suggestion that the ECB could charge banks who want to leave money with it has sent traders dashing into French and Belgian government bonds: The ECB is now showing off its new \u20ac5 notes... but Charles Forelle of the WSJ would rather hear Draghi answer a question on Cyprus's capital controls: The press conference is over with NO mention of the situation in Cyprus -- no questions about the fiasco of its original bailout, or the ongoing capital controls, unprecedented in the (short) history of the eurozone. The final question harks back to Pope Francis's tweet about how unemployment is caused by a \"self-centred mindset bent on profit at any cost\" (see 12.16pm). Is the ECB frustrated that joblessness in the eurozone is at record highs? \"We are frustrated, yes\", says Mario Draghi, who explains that the ECB has to work its powers through the financial system We can't just throw money out of helicoptors. We have to go via the banking system. The traditional question from Ireland, on whether there's any progress on its push to restructure its promissary notes, is met with the traditional answer - no. Draghi denies that the ECB and Germany have clashed, following Angela Merkel's recent comments that eurozone interest rates would be rather higher if they were aimed at the German economy. ECB independence is dear to all, and especially, I would say, to German citizens The ECB president points out that every member of the eurozone has its own business cycle: They are not synchronous and they differ very much across the euro area. So the monetary policy measures which can benefit in some may not benefit in others. One of the challenges of running a single currency.... Draghi gives a bit more details on how the ECB will help small firms get credit -- another of the decisions taken today. Dubbed the ABS programme, the ECB's governing council has: \"decided to start consultations with other European institutions on initiatives to promote a functioning market for asset-backed securities collateralised by loans to non-financial corporations. But, but... didn't the practice of bundling loans into new securities that were then sold on to other banks actually help to cause the crisis, asks one journalist? Draghi denies that the ECB would be encouraging banks to make dodgy loans. Instead, he suggests that lending conditions are actually improving, as the rejection rate for small firms seeking loans is dropping. Economist Frederik Ducrozet sums up Draghi's comments about whether there was unanimous support for today's decisions: That's another reason the euro has fallen, of course. The euro took a dive against the US dollar following Mario Draghi's comments about the possibility of negative eurozone interest rates for commercial banks (see 2.15pm). It has dropped more than a cent to as low as $1.308. Crumbs - Mario Draghi suggests that Europe could implement negative interest rates. Not for the man in the street, but for banks who want to lodge money with it. The ECB's deposit facility rate was left at 0.0% today. But asked whether it could be cut further, Draghi says that the ECB has an \"open mind\". It would have unintended consequences, he says, but nothing that the ECB couldn't deal with. (there's a great blog post on negative interest rates here, by Frances Coppola - The strange world of negative interest rates). Draghi has given a strong hint that today's decision to cut interest rates was not unanimous. He tells the press conference that: There was a very strong pervading consensus towards an interest rate cut, within that the consensus was towards a 25-bais point cut. Draghi's comments about taxes in Europe being too high has caused a stir: Michael Steen of the Financial Times asks Draghi whether today's decision is \"too little too late\", given the weak state of the eurozone economy, Draghi denies the charge, claiming that the ECB has been \"extraordinarily accomodative\". He points to rising stock markets and falling bond yields as signs that the ECB has been making decent progress. Steen also asks Draghi to elaborate on his comments about how governments should not \"unravel\" their progress on deficit reduction (see 1.48pm). Is this his contribution to the growth-vs-austerity debate? Draghi responds by reminding us of how the crisis began -- with governments with deficit/GDP ratios which were too high, which meant they were losing the confidnce fo the financial markets. We tackled those tail risks, Draghi insists (pointing to his OMT programme which could be used to buy peripheral government debt if needed). We are only \"left with the memory\" of those days of dangerous bond yields. And there is no question that fiscal consolidation is contractionary in the short term, Draghi says. \"Taxes were already too high in some countries\", so obviously raising them higher would hit demand. And countries need credibility, he continues -- so they should not abandon the progress they have made in reducing their deficits and making structural reforms. In Summary: Draghi is arguing that countries cannot simply abandon their plans for deficit reduction and embark on a borrowing spree to fuel growth. Onto the Q&amp;A -- and the honour of the first question goes to a local journalist, who asks if Mario Draghi could imagine rates being cut below their new record low. Draghi doesn't give a terribly straight answer in English - but explains that the ECB is watching the data, and \"stands ready to act\" if needed. He also points to the ECB's decision to maintain its refinancing operations until July 2014 -- we shouldn't underestimate the importance of this commitment, he claims. Draghi's final prepared remarks focus on government deficits -- he says it is crucial that eurozone governments do not \"unravel\" the progress made in reducing their borrowing needs. That sounds like an intervention into the ongoing austerity-vs-growth row. Draghi is arguing that governments must focus on structural reforms, to ensure long-term growth. Draghi is rattling through the ECB's official statement - it'll be online in a few minutes. The section on economic outlook is worth flagging up now: Overall labour market conditions remain weak ... weak economic sentiment has extended into the string of this year ... euro area export growth should benefit from a recovcery in global demand ... the improvements in financial markets since last summer should work their way through to the real economy... euro are economic activity should stabilise and recover gradually in the second half of the year. The risks ... continued to be on the downside. (grabbed from Reuters) As expected, Draghi also reminds governments that they need to take advantage of the current stable markets and make structural reforms (this is one of his favourite themes) Thirdly, the ECB has decided to begin discussions on how more support can be given to smaller firms through collateralising SME loans (hopefully we should get more details on this in the Q&amp;A) The ECB is closely monitoring money market conditions, Draghi says, and has decided to continue its \"main refinancing operations\" until at least July 2014. Draghi says that today's interest rate cut should help the eurozone economy recover \"later in the year\". Draghi begins by pointing to the weakness of the eurozone economy. He says that the monetary and loan environment remains subdued, and that weak economic sentiment has extended into the spring. Monetary policy will be accomodative for as long as needed, he add. The ECB press conference begins with Mario Draghi telling reporters that a number of decisions have been taken, including new decision on credit availability. He also revealed that European Commissioner Olli Rehn attended today's meeting, You can watch the ECB press conference on this webcast (although it's a little slow to load right now). It's also been transmitted live on Bloomberg TV. Alice Ross, the FT's currency correspondent, points out that Draghi's views on inflation will be interesting: The consumer prices index fell sharply to 1.2% last month, from 1.7%. In the ECB's world, price stability means an inflation rate close to, but below, 2%. Alice has also summarised the immediate reaction to the rate cut over on the FT's site (registration required). David Brown, of New View Economics, suggests today's rate cut is more symbolic than of real practical help: The ECB rate cut is no surprise as it was well flagged by Draghi at last month's meeting. Is it enough? No. The marginal effect of the cut is very limited, but at least it should have some symbolic rallying effect on economic confidence. My colleague Heather Stewart writes: Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has delivered an emergency quarter-point cut in interest rates in a bid to kickstart the recession-hit eurozone economy. After holding its policy meeting in Bratislava on Thursday, the ECB's governing council announced that it would reduce interest rates by a quarter-point, to 0.5%. It is the first cut since July 2012, shortly before Draghi promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the single currency and calmed markets in what became known as the \"Draghi put\". Heather's full news story is here: Eurozone interest rates cut to 0.5% Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees that the ECB's big challenge now is to get credit flowing to small firms in the eurozone: It seems unlikely that the ECB will take interest rates any lower than 0.50%, so attention is likely to increasingly focus on how the ECB can help facilitate getting more credit through to smaller and medium-sized companies in countries where they are finding it hard to get bank credit. Lorcan Roche Kelly, Trend Macrolytics's chief Europe strategist, makes a very good point (as usual): Cutting the European Central Bank's marginal lending facility rate*from 1.5% to 1% could reduce the cost of taking emergency liquidity assistance from the ECB. * - what the ECB charges banks to borrow from it Now attention turns to the ECB's press conference in Bratislava in 30 minutes time. Sony Kapoor of the Redefine thinktank hopes president Mario Draghi will announce extra stimulus measures (such as the extra borrowing help for small firms explained at 11.22am) Draghi, though, is also fond of reminding politicians that monetary policy can only do so much: The ECB rate cut was generally expected (and well-flagged), as you'll know if you're been reading the blog this morning. With eurozone inflation falling to 1.2%, well below the target of just under 2%, the governing council had every reason to cut rates to stimulate demand in the face of a pretty rubbish economic outlook. There's no dramatic reaction in the financial markets. After an early wobble, the euro has actually risen slightly to $1.32. The ECB's statement is online here. As well as cutting its main refinancing rate from 0.75% to 0.5%, the ECB voted to leave its deposit rate (what it charged banks to leave cash with it) at 0.0%. The marginal lending facility (what it costs banks to borrow from the ECB) is also cut to 1%, down from 1.5%. The European Central Bank has voted to cut interest rates by 0.25% to 0.5%. More to follow! Just five minutes to go until the ECB announces its monetary policy decisions, following today's meeting in Bratislava. The financial markets are pretty calm -- the euro is down 0.18 cents at $1.316. And the FTSE 100 is down 10 points at 6441. City pundits and analysts are speculating about what the ECB might announce this afternoon. Here's a couple of sensible suggestions: And a couple of more frivolous ideas for what the ECB might call a new scheme to help small firms: The Pope tweets: Yesterday Pope Francis spoke about the unemployment crisis during his weekly address in St Peter's Square (more details here). Italy's new prime minister, Enrico Letta, rounded off his mini-tour of Europe this morning by calling for new measures to address eurozone youth unemployment. On a visit to Brussels, Letta said politicians and officials need to make progress on the issue at next month's EU summit: We would ask above all that the fight against youth unemployment should be the most important, most concrete message to come out of the June European Council. The eurozone youth jobless rate hit a new record high of 24% last month, fuelling fears about a lost generation and social unrest. The ECB's governing council faces a tricky dilemma today. There are plenty of reasons to ease monetary policy (this morning's weak manufacturing data is just the latest), which is why a rate cut is pencilled in. But that alone will not a) cheer the markets, and b) (more importantly) provide much of a stimulatory boost to the eurozone. Firms who are struggling to stay afloat in Italy or Spain, for example, are not suddenly going to take out expansionary loans on the back of a quarter-point rate cut. And banks with unrecognised bad debts in the vault aren't going to suddenly stop hoarding capital either. As Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at ING, puts it: Data released since the April rate-setting meeting have provided further evidence that more monetary action could be needed in the euro zone... But as long as the transmission mechanism is not working, a rate cut could simply go up in smoke. Which is why several City anaysts believe Draghi may announce new measures to help small firms who do want to borrow. Other options in the toolkit include full-blown quantitative easing (don't get your hopes up) or 'verbal' intervention -- basically Draghi telling us all how long he thinks rates might stay at current levels. It is worth remembering that Draghi has already stabilised the eurozone and dragged down peripheral bond yields in his tenure as ECB president. That recovery, though, has still not made its way to the streets, homes and offices of the euro area, Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale sums it up (typically) well: The bottom line on the ECB today is that the real world is a different place from the fantasy world of markets. And the ECB has done a far, far better job of curing the market world than the real one. That is to say, we have a steady currency, tight spreads, low yields, and equity markets that are up on the year. Now, Mario, you need to tackle the real world's woes of recession, impending deflation, and catastrophic unemployment. And that is far, far harder... Re-Define's Sony Kapoor agrees that a rate cut is not enough: While Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities reckons the ECB will leave rates unchanged, as it hasn't finished preparing the unconventional measures it wants to deploy alongside it: The rationale is simple...a rate cut will do nothing to help the distressed peripheral economies (or indeed Germany), given the monetary transmission mechanism remains severely impaired...as such the ECB needs to find some further 'unconventional measures' to try and enhance the efficacy of a refi rate cut, and comments from various ECB officials (above all Constancio and Asmussen) last week made it clear that the process of coming up with such measures is by no means complete. France has sold \u20ac4bn of 10-year debt at a record low yield of 1.81%, as the bond market bubble continues to drive borrowing costs lower. Traders bid for twice as much debt as Paris had on offer - which helped to drive down the bond's interest rate to its all-time low. The French economy may be struggling, but that isn't deterring investors who are hungry for yield (especially as Central Banks maintain such loose monetary policy). Away from economic data....the mayor of Athens has declared a victory for democracy after banning the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party from handing out free food in Syntagma Square. Golden Dawn was barred from using Syntagma for its regular food handouts to the needy today. Mayor Giorgos Kaminis took the decision amid growing alarm over its \"Greeks only\" policy \u2013 in line with its virulent anti-immigrant views. Kaminis told Skai TV. Syntagma Square will never be used again by anyone to hand out goods, This square belongs to the city\u2019s residents. Only the municipality can decide how it is used. Greece's Kathimerini reports that riot police blocked Golden Dawn from accessing Syntagma this morning. Instead, the party apparently distributed its food at its own headquarters. Golden Dawn's food handouts have helped to build the party's popularity among Greeks suffering through its lengthening recession. It is vowing to continue the food handouts: As Helena Smith wrote last night: Pledging to defy a ban by the capital's mayor, the extremists said they would go ahead with the handout of traditional Orthodox Easter fare, including lamb and eggs, to Greeks afflicted by draconian austerity. \"It is food that is aimed for the thousands of Greek families blighted by the genocidal policies of the memorandum,\" said the party, referring to the loan agreement Athens has signed with international creditors to keep the debt-crippled country afloat. The neo-fascist organisation said the event was aimed solely at those Greeks who could not afford to enjoy Easter because of budget cuts and record levels of unemployment. \"Priority will be given to families with three or more children,\" it said in a statement. \"We remind the mayor that in Greece we still have a democracy.\" Heartening news from Britain's construction sector: it clawed its way back towards growth in April, with a monthly PMI of 49.4 (up from 47.2). Construction has been dragging UK GDP down in recent months -- at this rate, it might actually help the UK grow this quarter.... Amid the gloom of Europe's strinking manufacturing base, Greece's factory sector actually posted its best monthly data in 21 months. At 45, Greece's manufacturing PMI still showed a contraction, but it's a significantly better result than March's 42.1. Markits report showed a smaller fall in new orders than previously, and a slowdown in the rate at which firms cut jobs. Greece won't have turned the corner until new orders start to rise and firms begin rehiring. Markit warned that the sector will still drag on the Greek economy for several months. But it could be a glimmer of hope.... Europe's economic downturn has worsened, with manufacturing output sliding to a four-month low in April. The decline was mainly due to shrinking activity in Germany. But while Europe's biggest economy had a worryingly weak month, there were encouraging signs in Greece (more to follow). Markit's final manufacturing PMI survey for the eurozone came in at 46.7, which is a slightly more painful contraction than March's 46.8. Here are the key numbers: Germany: 48.1, down from March's 49 [anything below 50=shrinking output] France: 44.4, up from March's 44.0 Italy: 45.5, up from 44.5 Spain: 44.7, up from 44.2 Greece: 45.0, up from 42.1 The OECD has given Italian prime minister Enrico Letta a reminder of the challenge he faces, by slashing its economic projections for Italy. It cut its forecast for Italy 2013 GDP to -1.5% from 1.0% (in line with the IMF's latest projection). The OECD also hiked Italy 2013 Debt/GDP Forecast To 131.5% from 130.4%, and its 2014 prediction to 134.2% From 132.2%. Reminder: Greece's austerity package is designed to drag its debt/GDP ratio down to 120% by 2020 -- seen by the IMF as a key measure of debt sustainability. Spain's manufacturing sector has now been shrinking for two years, according to a new survey showing the Spanish downturn continued last month. Markit's monthly manufacturing PMI (a measure of activity across the sector) came in at 44.7; slightly better than March's 44.2, but still showing a steep decline. Markit's Andrew Harker warned that there was \"nothing in the survey\" to suggest an end to the slump. Another signal to the ECB that economic activity in the periphery is shrinking. Guy Johnson, Bloomberg's man in Bratislava, reports that president Draghi has been whisked in for the meeting: The euro has dropped a little this morning, as a rate cut looks increasingly likely (but not everyone believes the ECB governing council will do it) - currently down 0.2% at $1.315. Many European traders are catching up after yesterday's May Day holiday: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone financial crisis and across the world economy. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, takes centre-stage again today as the ECB gathers for its monthly meeting. With the eurozone economy shrinking, inflation dropping and unemployment at record highs, there's a strong expectation that the ECB will heed the danger signs and cut eurozone interest rates - trimming the main refinancing rate from 0.75% to 0.5%. But some economists are hoping for more decisive action from Draghi -- such as new measures to stimulate bank lending to Europe's small businesses. The ECB has decamped to Slovakia, Bratislava for today's meeting. We get the decision at 12.45 BST, but followed by the closely-watched press conference at 1.30pm BST. We shouldn't pretend that a small cut in interest rates will cure the patient, though. As Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics points out: The possible announcement of policies to stimulate bank lending, particularly to SMEs and in the region\u2019s periphery, might be more helpful. But even this would leave the ECB lagging behind other central banks. So, we'll see. I'll be watching the events in Bratislata, along with other developments around the eurozone and beyond....",

And banks with unrecognised bad debts in the vault aren't going to suddenly stop hoarding capital either.</p> <p>As <strong>Carsten Brzeski</strong>, senior economist at <strong>ING</strong>, puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Data released since the April rate-setting meeting have provided further evidence that more monetary action could be needed in the euro zone...</p> <p>But as long as the transmission mechanism is not working, a rate cut could simply go up in smoke.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which is why several City anaysts believe Draghi may announce new measures to help small firms who <strong>do </strong>want to borrow.</p> <p>Other options in the toolkit include full-blown quantitative easing (<em>don't get your hopes up</em>) or 'verbal' intervention -- basically Draghi telling us all how long he thinks rates might stay at current levels.</p> <p>It is worth remembering that Draghi has already stabilised the eurozone and dragged down peripheral bond yields in his tenure as ECB president. That recovery, though, has still not made its way to the streets, homes and offices of the euro area,</p> <p><strong>Kit Juckes</strong> of <strong>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </strong>sums it up (typically) well:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bottom line on the ECB today is that the real world is a different place from the fantasy world of markets. And the ECB has done a far, far better job of curing the market world than the real one.</p> <p>That is to say, we have a steady currency, tight spreads, low yields, and equity markets that are up on the year. Now, Mario, you need to tackle the real world's woes of recession, impending deflation, and catastrophic unemployment.

The enterprise received the medium-level financial award of \u00a330,000 from Santander's Social Enterprise Development Award programme. \"We get access to great advice and state-of-the-art training that we'd have to pay a lot of money for,\" says Powers. \"The business planning help has been great, as have the webinars, and we are working on a job plan for the intern that Santander is funding.\" Ben Allen, founder of The Oomph, which runs fitness classes for older people, says Ernst &amp; Young's Accelerator programme for social enterprises has helped him to franchise the business in Hong Kong. Social Enterprise UK, the sector's membership organisation, works with a number of corporates on their programmes and seems impressed with the offerings. Charlie Wigglesworth, head of business development, says: \"There has been a bit of cynicism. People ask, 'What can this massive company really do for me?' They say they want actual business rather than what they feel will just be some free advice,\" he says. \"We think the best ones offer financial help, advice and the opportunities to trade and be introduced to new clients. But we're generally very happy with what these firms are providing.\" Perhaps the latest offering from Telefonica, due to launch next month, signals a different direction for corporate social enterprise programmes. The telecoms giant is proposing a different programme in number of ways, not least because it is backed by government funding. The company has linked up UnLtd, the foundation for social entrepreneurs, with Wayra \u2013 it's tech start up incubator \u2013 to create a growth hub for 30 tech social enterprise startups (in three cohorts of 10). Dan Lehner, head of ventures at UnLtd, is excited about the potential of the programme. \"Each company will get eight months' office space and state-of-the-art equipment, as well as access to a huge range of events, guest mentors and advisers,\" says Lehner. \"Telefonica has 300 million customers globally. Combine this with UnLtd's experience of working with social entrepreneurs and I think this is a winning prospects.\" Lehner also believes this opens the door for companies in other sectors such as hospitality, construction, travel, retail and more to provide similar incubation spaces in the coming years. Watch this space to see if they take up the challenge. Deloitte Social Innovation Pioneers About 15-20 winners in the second round of Deloitte's programme will be selected this month. Thirty winners were chosen last year, and the company intends to work with some of these on an ongoing basis. Successful applicants will need to have two years of trading accounts. They will not receive money, but will get regular workshops, tailored advice and access to Deloitte's business and client networks to ensure they are investment ready and to support their growth plans. There is also the opportunity to become part of the company's supply chain. Wayra/UnLtd social enterprise tech incubator This month, UnLtd (social enterprise support network) and Wayra (Telefonica's global tech startup incubator) will put out call for 10 social enterprise technology start-ups to spend eight months, based rent-free, at Wayra's central London office. The scheme is backed by the government's \u00a310m Social Incubator Fund, and will take on three cohorts of 10 startups, each of which will receive \u00a340,000 as an equity investment, for a 10% share of the business. Any profits will be recycled into the social enterprise sector. To be eligible, a social enterprise must be under two years old and not have received more than \u00a3100,000 of investment so far. After eight months' incubation \u2013 including access to events and mentoring schemes \u2013 the team will help the ventures pitch for follow-on funding. Santander Social Enterprise Development Awards On 3 June, the second year of Santander's Social Enterprise Development Awards (SSEDA) will open.
