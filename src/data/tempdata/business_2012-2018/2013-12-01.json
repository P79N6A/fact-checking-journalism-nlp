    "webTitle": "Bali talks are make or break for World Trade Organisation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Globalisation is in retreat. Countries are becoming less reliant on each other. They show a willingness to use currency manipulation as an economic tool. Surreptitious protectionism is being deployed. For the most part these developments are happening below the radar, which is why it has been possible to ignore them. That will not be the case this week when trade ministers from 159 countries meet in Bali in the hopes of salvaging something from 12 years of so far fruitless talks. Bali matters. At stake is not just the future of the World Trade Organisation, but the way and for whom the global economy is governed. There is everything to play for when the WTO ministerial meeting begins on Tuesday. Trade ministers have travelled far and wide in search of a deal. In 1999, talks called to launch a new round in Seattle were the story of bad blood at the negotiating table and riots on the streets. It took a burst of international solidarity after 9/11 to launch the talks in Doha two years later. Cancun in 2003 saw a further setback as a group of the leading developing countries made it clear that they were not prepared to accept the usual stitch-up organised by the US and the European Union. Now it is make or break time. When the talks began in 2001 the talk was of opening up new fronts in trade liberalisation, cutting tariffs and tearing down protectionist barriers in services and agriculture just as they had been progressively in manufacturing in the decades after the second world war. All that's left now of the original agenda is a proposal to cut trade red tape and root out corruption at borders, coupled with the promise of easier access to western markets for the world's least developed nations. But even the low-hanging fruit is proving hard to pick. Developing countries say they will need time and money to improve their customs practices, while western nations say that without a trade facilitation deal they will not sign off on better access to their markets for exports from the poorest countries. A bigger problem may be India's insistence that it be allowed to stockpile subsidised grain to ensure food security. The Americans are unhappy about providing an open-ended commitment. The package on the table would have little real impact on the global economy. On the other hand, failure this week would be a disaster for the WTO, which might continue as the court where trade disputes are settled but would cease to exist as a forum for serious trade liberalisation talks. Already, the bigger global players are seeking to cut their own side deals, seeing that as easier than the tortuous process of getting agreement at the WTO. Washington and Brussels almost certainly underestimate the time and effort it will take to forge their transatlantic trade partnership, but frustration with the WTO process means that's where the political energy already is. A big fat zero in Bali could easily result in the EU and the US giving up on multilateral negotiations completely. So how did it come to this? Well, let's start by turning the clock back to Geneva in December 1993, when Peter Sutherland, the then head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, ended the Uruguay round of trade liberalisation talks. It was four years after the end of the cold war, two years since the collapse of the Soviet Union. China and India were opening their economies up and Russia was being given free-market shock treatment. It was the high noon of liberalisation. Even so, completing the Uruguay round was no picnic. It took seven years and was only brought to a conclusion after the G7 took a hand at its 1993 summit in Tokyo. Few though would have suspected that the world would still be waiting for a successor to the Uruguay round two decades later. There was no desire to launch another round immediately, and the priority by the end of the 1990s was to secure China's entry into the WTO, something that coincided with the launch of the Doha round in November 2001. But since then, there have been a number of developments that have made it much harder to secure an agreement. The first is the impact of the financial crisis and the recession that followed. This has made countries more inward-looking and cautious about opening up their markets to foreign competition. A second has been rising energy prices, which have pushed up the cost of transporting goods around the world and made offshoring less attractive. A third has been the growing prosperity of China, where labour costs are still low in comparison with those in the west but not as low as they were a decade ago. James Carrick, economist at Legal &amp; General, says: \"Since 2006, the ratio of global imports to production has moved sideways. In other words, a product bought today is using the same proportion of domestic and foreign components as a product bought six years ago. This is in sharp contrast to the prior two decades of globalisation, when more and more of the goods we bought were made overseas. \"The pause in import penetration has not just happened in weak economies like the UK and the euro area, but has been most pronounced in China \u2013 the strongest economy \u2013 as well as the relatively robust US.\" Carrick says closer integration of economies in the 1990s was associated with cheaper imports into the west from China and other emerging economies, so a stalling of globalisation can be expected to lead to higher global inflation. The stalling may not be temporary. Technological trends suggest the world will become more integrated; political trends point in the opposite direction. In the west, globalisation is not associated with cheaper imports but with manufacturing jobs being lost to offshoring and service sector jobs threatened by cheap migrant labour. Few voters will be impressed by warnings from business groups that failure in Bali will mean throwing away the possibility of a $1tn boost to the global economy. That's only partly because the $1tn figure is made up; it's also because the public now associates increased integration with falling wages and job insecurity. Precedent suggests that if there is a $1tn boost to the global economy on offer, the benefits will accrue to capital as higher profits rather than to labour in the form of higher pay or lower prices. Free trade is seen as a racket dominated by a particular class interest. Unless that changes and the fruits are more equitably shared, the WTO will continue to stumble from crisis to crisis and globalisation will remain a dirty word.",

It was four years after the end of the cold war, two years since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>China and India were opening their economies up and Russia was being given free-market shock treatment. It was the high noon of liberalisation. Even so, completing the Uruguay round was no picnic. It took seven years and was only brought to a conclusion after the G7 took a hand at its 1993 summit in Tokyo. Few though would have suspected that the world would still be waiting for a successor to the Uruguay round two decades later.</p> <p>There was no desire to launch another round immediately, and the priority by the end of the 1990s was to secure China's entry into the WTO, something that coincided with <a href=\"http://www.globalissues.org/article/296/wto-meeting-in-doha-qatar-2001\" title=\"\">the launch of the Doha round in November 2001</a>. But since then, there have been a number of developments that have made it much harder to secure an agreement. The first is the impact of the financial crisis and the recession that followed. This has made countries more inward-looking and cautious about opening up their markets to foreign competition.</p> <p>A second has been rising energy prices, which have pushed up the cost of transporting goods around the world and made offshoring less attractive. A third has been the growing prosperity of China, where labour costs are still low in comparison with those in the west but not as low as they were a decade ago.</p> <p>James Carrick, economist at Legal &amp; General, says: \"Since 2006, the ratio of global imports to production has moved sideways. In other words, a product bought today is using the same proportion of domestic and foreign components as a product bought six years ago. This is in sharp contrast to the prior two decades of globalisation, when more and more of the goods we bought were made overseas.</p> <p>\"The pause in import penetration has not just happened in weak economies like the UK and the euro area, but has been most pronounced in China \u2013 the strongest economy \u2013 as well as the relatively robust US.\" Carrick says closer integration of economies in the 1990s was associated with cheaper imports into the west from China and other emerging economies, so a stalling of globalisation can be expected to lead to higher global inflation.</p> <p>The stalling may not be temporary. Technological trends suggest the world will become more integrated; political trends point in the opposite direction. In the west, globalisation is not associated with cheaper imports but with manufacturing jobs being lost to offshoring and service sector jobs threatened by cheap migrant labour. Few voters will be impressed by warnings from business groups that failure in Bali will mean throwing away the possibility of a $1tn boost to the global economy.</p> <p>That's only partly because the $1tn figure is made up; it's also because the public now associates increased integration with falling wages and job insecurity. Precedent suggests that if there is a $1tn boost to the global economy on offer, the benefits will accrue to capital as higher profits rather than to labour in the form of higher pay or lower prices.</p> <p>Free trade is seen as a racket dominated by a particular class interest. Unless that changes and the fruits are more equitably shared, the WTO will continue to stumble from crisis to crisis and globalisation will remain a dirty word.</p>",

This month's 6% drop makes 2013 a terrible year for gold, and is set to mark the end of a 13-year boom. Gold is heading for its first annual fall since 2000 after shedding a quarter of its value this year. Things were so different in September 2011, when it hit a record price of $1,921 an ounce, a gain of more than 550% in just over a decade. Investors had piled in during the financial crisis: the price of gold traditionally rises when assets such as shares, bonds and cash are threatened. Gold maintained its allure as central banks pumped money into their economies, raising fears of runaway inflation. But then the easing of fears for the eurozone, and signs of economic recovery in the US and other economies, steadied nerves. There were few starker signs of the reversal of gold's fortunes than the news that Britain's second-biggest pawnbroker was melting down stock to raise money. Last week Albemarle &amp; Bond admitted it was smelting jewellery to sell for quick cash in order to stay within its lending limits. As recently as 2011 the company went on a gold-fuelled expansion spree and declared \"the age of the pawnbroker\". More famous players have also been caught out. The gold fund of John Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made billions betting against the US housing market, is down 63% this year. The key to the fall is the improving US economy and the response of the Federal Reserve. Gold's troubles began when the Fed said it would ease off its bond purchase programme amid encouraging news on jobs and growth. With less need to keep money tied up in gold, which pays no interest or dividend, the markets turned \"risk-on\": investors scrambled for new shares in Royal Mail and other flotations, and US shares are at all-time highs. Georgette Boele at Dutch bank ABN Amro said: \"The gold bubble has burst and \u2026 more of gold's previous supportive drivers are about to push the precious metal much lower. As such we expect additional large sell-offs.\" In India, traditionally the world's biggest consumer of gold, the government has imposed punishing duty on gold purchases which has led to mass recycling of some of the 20,000 tonnes of gold stashed in Indian homes.

The vow boss Michael O'Leary made to mend his ways, or to \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/20/ryanair-image-change-which-survey\" title=\"\">stop unnecessarily pissing people off</a>\", is bearing fruit. Like Scrooge banging on the Cratchetts' door with a turkey, the airline is, in a small but significant change, letting passengers bring a second small carry-on bag \u2013 not least for gifts from the airport shop. But what were the visions of doom that spooked the Irish Ebenezer, and how is he changing course?</p> <p>Musing on the ghosts of aviation past might lead O'Leary to a happy early scene recalled by Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG. In his Aer Lingus days, Walsh's employees watched and scratched their heads at Ryanair's swift turnaround of aircraft at Dublin airport \u2013 an operation perfected like clockwork in half the time other carriers were managing. Ryanair transformed aviation with its cost-cutting, eliminating overheads and pulling in customers with fares rivals struggled to match. Baggage was discouraged and seating unreserved, to make the whole process as swift and cheap as possible. Fines for forgotten boarding cards seemed punitive but had their logic, as did a website designed to deter third parties from booking up blocks of cheap fares.

      "bodyText": "Passengers checking in on Ryanair flights on Sunday will be the first to experience a modern-day seasonal redemption. The vow boss Michael O'Leary made to mend his ways, or to \"stop unnecessarily pissing people off\", is bearing fruit. Like Scrooge banging on the Cratchetts' door with a turkey, the airline is, in a small but significant change, letting passengers bring a second small carry-on bag \u2013 not least for gifts from the airport shop. But what were the visions of doom that spooked the Irish Ebenezer, and how is he changing course? Musing on the ghosts of aviation past might lead O'Leary to a happy early scene recalled by Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG. In his Aer Lingus days, Walsh's employees watched and scratched their heads at Ryanair's swift turnaround of aircraft at Dublin airport \u2013 an operation perfected like clockwork in half the time other carriers were managing. Ryanair transformed aviation with its cost-cutting, eliminating overheads and pulling in customers with fares rivals struggled to match. Baggage was discouraged and seating unreserved, to make the whole process as swift and cheap as possible. Fines for forgotten boarding cards seemed punitive but had their logic, as did a website designed to deter third parties from booking up blocks of cheap fares. Unfortunately, the cold logic ended up alienating many of the potential customers O'Leary wanted to attract. It wouldn't require the ghost of aviation present to suggest that not all is rosy for Ryanair, with two profit warnings between August and October. O'Leary, who has banked enormous wealth as a major shareholder, will have noticed a \u00a330m hit when shares tumbled.

      "bodyText": "When the 2011 tsunami hit Japan's Fukushima plant, causing one of the world's worst nuclear disasters, it set off a chain reaction of research into nuclear safety on the other side of the world. As Dr Tom Scott of Bristol University watched footage of Japanese workers risking their lives to measure radiation at the plant, he thought there had to be a safer way. And so the airborne radiation monitoring system was born: a flying machine the size of a bathmat that can be controlled from anywhere in the world, avoiding the need to send people in to contaminated sites. In the event of an accident, his \"hexacopter\" machines, which are still at the prototype stage, would \"automatically go up like an intelligent crowd of angry bees\", says Scott. But that cannot happen until the machines manage to fly out of the lab and into full production. Showing the hexacopter, and videos of it in action, to potential investors at a conference in London, Scott said: \"We are really good at what we do: what we want now is to attract people who have the experience to spin out the company.\" Keen to get back to the lab, he and his team are looking for someone to manage the business. \"They will be guiding everything: relationships with customers, negotiations for licensing and leasing, recruiting, accountancy, marketing \u2013 and bringing in phenomenal contacts.\" Another company on the hunt for investors is Mountain Trike, founded by engineering graduates from Bath University. It makes an all-terrain wheelchair that can tackle sand, snow and mud. Putting it through its paces on a somewhat less demanding plush carpet, commercial director Ed Elias told a crowd of potential investors how it has the shock-absorbers, wheels and powertrain of a mountain bike, controlled by levers to prevent users getting muddy hands. About 70 Mountain Trike wheelchairs have already been sold, but the company is looking for \u00a3250,000 from angel investors to help it crack the US market. British universities are more preoccupied than ever with turning their best research into commercial companies. Traditionally, British scientists have excelled in the lab, but are less good at turning their ideas into money-spinning businesses. As one familiar lament goes, while the world wide web was created by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee at the Cern laboratory in Geneva, it was the whizzkids of Silicon Valley who spun the idea into the commercial gold of Google, Facebook and Twitter. \"We need to harness the intellectual horsepower in our universities,\" says Sir John Parker, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, who believes a cultural shift is under way. \"We are not where Silicon Valley is yet, but I believe we are heading in the right direction.\" In a time of austerity, universities are being asked to do more to boost economic growth. In a government-commissioned report published last month, Sir Andrew Witty, boss of pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline, said: \"This country leads the world in many cutting-edge technologies and inventions. But too often we fail to turn these great ideas into successful companies that create jobs.\" Witty wants to see a \u00a31bn fund to help researchers at Britain's universities get their ideas to market. The fact that the report was commissioned at all is another sign of the coalition's conversion to industrial policy. These days government ministers sprinkle their speeches with jargon such as \"arrow project\", \"catapult centre\" and \"the eight great technologies\". The coalition also chose to preserve Labour's Technology Strategy Board, an organisation that doles out public money to promising companies. Somehow, the UK has ended up with an industrial policy. \"It is one of the great surprises of the past few years,\" said Andy Westwood, a former Labour adviser and chief executive of GuildHE, a higher education lobby group. After the crash, Labour was reluctant to use the term \"industrial policy\", he said, \"but now all three parties happily trot around that phrase\". The problem, says Westwood, is that 30 years of free-market philosophy have left the UK trailing behind rivals such as Germany that have spent years nurturing their manufacturing sectors: \"We have slowly dismantled the infrastructure over three decades. You cannot just pull a lever and get it all back overnight.\" With institutional investors focused on property and the stock market, would-be entrepreneurs find it hard to raise capital. Graham Harrison of Setsquared, a collaboration between five English universities, says researchers are caught between angel investors \u2013 wealthy individuals who might invest up to \u00a3125,000 \u2013 and venture capital funds that are not interested in deals worth less than \u00a310m. \"Companies looking for half a million fall between two stools.\" Setsquared has helped new companies raise \u00a31bn over the past 10 years. One beneficiary is Jacob Marsh, 24, who founded his company while at university. Seeing the popularity of Raspberry Pi, the credit-card sized computers that have acquired cult status among programming hobbyists, Marsh hit on the idea of making cases for them. Initially he used 3D printers, but within a few days was overwhelmed with orders. SetSquared helped him find a factory to make the cases, which now retail for about \u00a36 (ModMyPi.com). \"Part of our success was that we were able to get the product to market so fast, and we could do that because we had the support.\" But not everyone finds the ivory tower conducive to enterprise. Daniel Murray, a marine biologist, decided to leave academia to create his water-purification business. \"A lot of professors are really set in their ways and don't do blue-sky thinking any more,\" he said. Last year he set up Industrial Phycology, which is trialling a water treatment process for Wessex Water. It uses algae to remove phosphates from waste water, in a process that should help utilities comply with EU rules aimed at reducing water pollution, as well as generating a byproduct that can be used for bioenergy. Murray has already been talking to investors in India \u2013 a big step for someone who hadn't even thought of starting his own company a year ago. The public sector could be the key to a strong industrial policy, according to Westwood. The UK has huge strengths in the creative industries and life sciences: these could be used along with, say, the BBC and the NHS to \"develop a sensible policy to support jobs\". In this way the public purse \u2013 from the NHS drugs and technology budget to high-speed rail projects \u2013 could be used to support British tech start-ups. \"Even when cash is limited,\" he said, \"you can still join some of the dots more cleverly.\"",
