      "bodyText": "Economists are always looking for new ways to measure growth. There has been the \"lipstick index\", for instance, to track splurges on little luxuries in lean times and the scrutiny of dry cleaner turnover to gauge disposable incomes. Now the Bank of England has outlined how it tries to keep up with global growth thanks to a range of measures, from survey results to more offbeat indicators such as Suez Canal traffic and global air freight data. Its experience suggests a mix of direct indicators, such as the OECD composite leading indicator \u2013 a basket of economic data \u2013 and indirect indicators, like that freight data, worked best in the post-2008 crisis era. Since 2010, however, models based on just the export orders index from JPMorgan's global manufacturing PMI survey have produced the smallest errors, says Kate Stratford of the Bank's international economic analysis division. Why does this guessing game matter? Firstly, because policymakers need a sense of worldwide demand while they await the official global GDP and trade data. Those GDP and trade numbers have a significant lag and in many countries, for example, official first quarter GDP numbers are not out till May. Secondly, the global picture \"is an important driver of UK activity\", influencing demand for exports but also confidence and spending decisions, according to Stratford. And so her team provides Bank policymakers with a global \"nowcast\", or a best guess of the current pace of quarterly growth of world GDP and trade. \"Nowcasting is especially important when there are large shocks hitting the world economy, as this can give an early steer on how large the real-economy impacts of such shocks are likely to be,\" she writes in the Bank's quarterly bulletin.So economists take note: ditch the glamour of lipsticks and laundered coats for that export orders index.",

    "webTitle": "Government kicks off Lloyds sale", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government on Monday began to sell off its stake in Lloyds Banking Group in a move that marks a significant step in returning the bailed out bank to the private sector five years after the financial crisis began. The announcement was made just after the stock market closed when the banks advising the government started to approach major investors about buying chunks of the 4.2bn shares \u2013 currently valued at \u00a33.3bn \u2013 being sold. About 6% of shares in the group are being sold, which would reduce the government's stake from 38.7% to 32.7%. The timing, in the midst of the Liberal Democrat party conference, means the Lloyds shares will be sold ahead of the \u00a33bn privatisation of Royal Mail, although the size of the stake being sold is smaller than some City analysts had expected. After conducting a daily analysis of the Lloyds' share price throughout the summer, UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body set up to look after the stakes in the bailed out banks, advised George Osborne earlier on Monday afternoon that it is now time to kickstart the privatisation. Osborne said on Monday night: \"Five years ago the previous government used taxpayers' money to bail out the banks and I've been absolutely determined to get that money back for taxpayers so we can pay down debt. Today we have started to do that and it is another step in the long journey to repair what went so badly wrong in the British economy.\" The exact price at which the shares are sold was expected to be announced on Tuesday, as the fifth anniversary approaches of the rescue of HBOS by Lloyds TSB to create the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group. The bank was eventually bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayer money. The government is expected to be able to claim it has made a profit \u2013 albeit a small one \u2013 on the sale which has been the subject of much speculation since the chancellor's Mansion House speech in June when he signalled preparations for the privatisation of Lloyds but played down the prospect of a quick sale of bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland. In that speech, Osborne signalled that after a sale of Lloyds shares to major institutions, retail investors would be given the chance to buy shares. This option has not been ruled out, and the Policy Exchange thinktank is recommending a sale of the remaining stake through a mass distribution to taxpayers. Since the speech, major investors have been sounded out by UKFI and its advisers about buying the shares and have already signalled their willingness to buy the stock, which has rallied sharply \u2013 in part helped by the government's housing schemes, which have bolstered the mortgage market. \"We want to get the best value for the taxpayer, maximise support for the economy and restore them to private ownership. The government will only conclude a sale if these objectives are met,\" a Treasury spokesman said. But Chris Leslie, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said Osborne was continuing to duck \"serious reform of our banking sector\". \"It's vital that taxpayers get their money back and this must be the prime consideration in the sale of the government's stakes in the banks. And as Labour has consistently said any profits from the sale should be used to repay the national debt,\" Leslie said. The shares closed on Monday night at 77.3p \u2013 above the 73.6p average price at which the government spent \u00a320bn buying the stake. The shares are likely to be sold at a slight discount to that price but still higher than the average price at which they were bought and well above the 61p stated in the national accounts. The 61p level represents the average price at which the shares were trading on the days the government bought the shares, rather than the actual price paid. The government had already indicated it regards 61p as its benchmark for the sale and this is the price to which it has linked the \u00a31.5m bonus of the chief executive of Lloyds, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio. He can receive his bonus if a third of its stake is sold above 61p. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said the sale \"reflects the hard work undertaken over the last two years to make Lloyds a safe and profitable bank that is focused on supporting the UK economy\". UKFI \u2013 which also announced that James Leigh-Pemberton, son of former Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton, is to be its new boss \u2013 said it would not place any more shares for 90 days. Paras Anand, head of European equities at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said the placing was \"a clear sign of confidence that the bank is well on the road to recovery\". RBS sale must wait The launch of the Lloyds shares sale puts its prospects in stark contrast to those of Royal Bank of Scotland, the other financial institution rescued with taxpayer money. While Lloyds embarks on its path back into private hands, a sale of RBS \u2013 which is 81%-owned by the taxpayer \u2013 is clearly further away. Its share price is still well below the level where taxpayers stepped in and George Osborne has commissioned a review by investment bankers at Rothschild into whether it should be broken up into a good bank and a bad bank. The rescued bank's boss Stephen Hester resigned in June in a move intended to speed up a sell-off of the taxpayer stake, bought for \u00a345bn in 2008 and 2009 to stop the Edinburgh-based bank collapsing. RBS managementrs have said it could be ready for sale from the middle of 2014 \u2013 or even earlier. But the Rothschild review process delays any potential privatisation and the chancellor has said selling the government's stake is \"some way off\". The results of the Rothschild review are expected later this month and in the meantime support for a split has been growing.Shares in RBS closed at 366.5p last night, a level that represents a \u00a312bn loss on the money ploughed in by the taxpayer, at an average price of around 500p.

      "bodyText": "Barclays revealed on Monday that it is contesting a \u00a350m fine by the City regulator, which claims the bank behaved \"recklessly\" in the controversial 2008 fundraisings that allowed it to avoid a taxpayer bailout. As Barclays formally launched a \u00a36bn cash call and admitted its investment banking earnings were \"significantly\" lower than a year ago, the bank provided more details about the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and Serious Fraud Office into the way it disclosed details of fees to the Middle Eastern investors who backed its two fundraisings at the height of the financial crisis five years ago. There was no statement from the FCA on Monday, but Barclays said the regulator intended to levy one of its largest ever fines of \u00a350m, only a year after Barclays incurred what was then a record fine of \u00a359.5m for rigging Libor. That fine has since been surpassed by Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS, also for manipulating the key interest rate. According to the new information provided by Barclays, the FCA has concluded that the bank should have disclosed more details about the fees due to Qatar Holdings, which amounted to \u00a3322m over five years. Barclays, which is contesting the allegations, cites a \"formal warning\" notice from the FCA which has warned the bank that it \"acted recklessly\" in the way it disclosed the information about the fees and in so doing breached some of the rules governing the way shares are listed on the stock exchange. According to Barclays, the existence of the \"advisory services agreement\" in June 2008 was disclosed but not the advisory services agreement in October 2008. The FCA's warning notice asserted that while Barclays believed at the time that there should be at least some value from the agreements, their primary purpose was to make additional payments for the participation of the Qatar state's investment arm in the capital raisings. \"While the warning notices consider that Barclays and Barclays Bank believed at the time that there should be at least some unspecified and undetermined value to be derived from the agreements, they state that the primary purpose of the agreements was not to obtain advisory services but to make additional payments, which would not be disclosed, for the Qatari participation in the capital raisings,\" the bank said.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Five years after the financial crisis, America's super-rich have recovered all their losses to see their wealth reach an all-time high. According to Forbes magazine the 400 wealthiest Americans are worth a record $2.02 trillion (\u00a31.4tn), up from $1.7tn in 2012, a collective fortune slightly bigger than Russia's economy. In another sign of fizziness at the top of the economy, the cost to enter the billionaires' club has also gone up to levels not seen since the 2008 crash. In 2013, an aspiring plutocrat needs at least $1.3bn to make the Forbes list \u2013 the highest since just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent stock markets plummeting. Bill Gates has been named as the richest American for the 20th year in a row, with a personal fortune of $72bn. The computer entrepreneur turned philanthropist recovered his position as the world's richest man in May, when he overtook mobile phone tycoon Carlos Slim, who had held the top spot for the previous four years. Gates, the university drop-outwho founded Microsoft and has given away $28bn since 1994, saw his fortune grow by $6bn since 2012, partly helped by a rise in Microsoft's stock price since August. In second place is Warren Buffett, the investor feted for his shrewdness, who recently bought Heinz. Buffett, with a fortune of $58.5bn, was one of the biggest gainers in 2013, which helped him retain his place on the list. The outspoken founder of software company Oracle, Larry Ellison, takes third place with a $41bn fortune. The richest woman in the US, and the world, is Christy Walton, who inherited a retail fortune when her husband died in 2005. Walton is estimated to be worth $35.4bn, thanks to her shares in the world's largest supermarket Walmart, which has annual sales of $466bn and employs 2.2 million people worldwide \u2013 a workforce bigger than the population of Slovenia. She shares the Walmart fortune with her brother-in law Jim and sister in law Alice, who take sixth and seventh place on the list, with around $33bn each. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg edged into the top 20 after his personal fortune doubled to $19bnas the tech company's stock price revived over the summer, following a wobbly stock market debut in 2012. But the social media tycoon is not the youngest on the list. That title belongs to his former dorm mate and Facebook co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz, 29, just a few days younger than Zuckerberg. Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York who made a fortune with the eponymous news and data company, retains his place as America's richest politician. Bloomberg, worth $31bn and America's 10th richest individual, is due to stand down as mayor in December. According to Forbes, one in 10 of the top 400 richest Americans are foreign-born. These include George Soros, the Hungarian-born investor, who 'broke the Bank of England' during the sterling crisis in 1992 and was wrongly pronounced dead by Reuters earlier this year. Others include Ukranian-born serial investor and London dweller Len Blavatnik ($17.8bn); Russian-born Google co-founder Sergey Brin ($24bn) and the Australian-born media tycoon Rupert Murdoch ($13.bn). Forbes reported that 34 people had slipped out of the rich list, including oilman T Boone Pickens, who lost his shirt investing in wind power at a time of falling gas prices, cutting his fortune to $950m, while AOL founder Steve Case saw his fortune fall to $1.2bn as an investment in LivingSocial, a rival to online discount website Groupon, turned sour.",

The Bank of Japan has Sayuri Shirai as one of the nine members of its Policy Board. But surprisingly, it is in Russia that a female head of a central bank is to be found. Elvira Nabiullina took office in June of this year after her appointment by President Putin \u2013 not a man known for his feminist views.</p> <p>When asked about being one of the few female central bankers in the world Dr Yellen said \"I really think this is something we're going to see increase over time, and it's time for that to happen.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Let's hope it starts with her being appointed as the world's most powerful central banker.

Ms Yellen, whose chances of taking the Chairmanship will appear to have improved with Prof Summers' withdrawal, may be of a generally 'dovish' disposition.</p> <p>But she has not dissented from the Bernanke schedule nor has she released any public comment recently about economic growth or unemployment that suggests she might look with favour on a more accommodative policy-course than the FOMC consensus currently approves.</p> </blockquote> <p>There remains the mystery of why President Obama has appeared reluctant to nominate Yellen already.

The economy remains fragile. And unemployment is still far too high.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Draghi</strong>&#xa0;is reminding his audience of German small business owners that the eurozone faced\" difficult circumstances\" a year ago, with \"severe tensions in financial markets\" as investors feared the break-up of the euro.</p> <p>That threat has receded, he said, but Europe remains too weak:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My main message is that we have made significant progress on the first step, stabilising the euro area. But there is still work to do to transform this achievement into higher growth and employment. Strengthening the euro area through sustainable policies, higher competitiveness and stronger common institutions is therefore our priority for today.</p> </blockquote> <p>The speech contained some familiar themes -- unemployment remains too high, and banking union remains incomplete.</p> <p>On competitiveness, Draghi actually hails the drop in wages in some eurozone countries:&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One way to regain competitiveness quickly is to address the numerator in unit labour costs \u2013 nominal wages. Another, longer-term approach is to increase the denominator \u2013 to achieve higher productivity. In my view, in the euro area today we need both.</p> <p>On the first count, there are already some encouraging signs of rebalancing in the euro area in terms of cost competitiveness. Thanks in part to the structural reforms introduced in several countries, relative costs are adjusting where they had become misaligned in the past.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 - <em>presumably the title is a reference&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=sly%20and%20the%20family%20stone%20a%20family%20affair&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC0QtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNdiRhzTsSnk&amp;ei=mLw2UtS8GajF7AaIxYGQCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYuJQ18g5k2lG0c4AoRcgnnHIE6w&amp;sig2=nvWFiDEF0KkB7alCqiFwGA&amp;bvm=bv.52164340,d.ZGU\">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, following Mark Carney's decision to name-check young UK singer-songwriter Jake Bugg last month.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5236bae1e4b0cbc84ec2c0fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T08:04:38.447Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Berlin, European central bank president Mario Draghi has begun giving a speech - here's the wire snaps off the Reuters terminal....</p> <p><strong>16-Sep-2013 09:00 - ECB'S DRAGHI - EURO ZONE ECONOMY REMAINS FRAGILE, UNEMPLOYMENT FAR TOO HIGH </strong></p> <p><strong>16-Sep-2013 09:00 - ECB'S DRAGHI - GIVEN SUBDUED INFLATION OUTLOOK, EXPECT KEY INTEREST RATES TO REMAIN AT CURRENT OR LOWER LEVELS FOR EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME </strong></p> <p><strong>16-Sep-2013 09:00 - ECB'S DRAGHI - BANKING UNION SHOULD HELP SPEED UP THE REPAIR OF BANKS - THAT IS IF, AS I HOPE, WE END UP WITH A STRONG SINGLE RESOLUTION MECHANISM&#xa0;</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T08:04:45.689Z\">at 9.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5236b781e4b00fa1bc127c71\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-16T07:56:03.415Z\">8.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Kit Juckes</strong> of<strong>&#xa0;Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale&#xa0;</strong>dubs today's market action the \"Larry Rally\", and&#xa0;puts&#xa0;his finger firmly on the causes of the buoyant financial markets -- easy money.&#xa0;</p> <p>From his morning note to clients:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Five (long) years on from Lehman\u2019s collapse, and while the global economy is still struggling to find its feet, financial markets are riding high.

      "bodyText": "What was touted as a speech marking the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis became more of an all-purpose speech on everything the president is dealing with nowadays. First a briefing on the Navy Yard shooting, then an update on Syria negotiations, followed by a few words about those crazy September days of five years ago. From there he listed executive actions and legislative measures ranging from mortgage refinancing programs to Dodd-Frank (especially the CFPB) to Obamacare. If there was a single purpose to these remarks, it was to reinforce his postures leading up to congressional spending and debt ceiling debates. He is willing to negotiate on spending cuts for extraneous items, and believes the sequester must be replaced, but he sees no need to further gut spending on things like education or research. And, of course, he will not negotiate away his signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act. Most importantly, he reiterated that he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling. The speech is over. From Speaker Boehner's spokesperson, in what we expect to be the first of many similar reactions from Republicans: \"Are some of these folks so beholden to one extreme wing of their party that they're willing to tank the entire economy?\" \"I will not negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States.\" On Obamacare, and Republican threats to tie its undoing to upcoming budget and debt ceiling measures: \"The candidate who called for repeal lost.\" \"I cannot remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it doesn't get 100% of what it wants. That's never happened before. But that's what's happening now.\" On the debt ceiling: Congress must pass a budget without threatening a shutdown or \"even worse, threatening not to pay the country's bills.\" \"Our economy's not growing as fast as it should and we're not creating as many jobs as we should because the sequester's in place... It's irresponsible to keep it in place.\" He turns to Congress, and what it must focus on in upcoming federal spending battles. \"Government is gonna have a critical role\" in shaping the course of growth in the coming years, and opportunities \"for this generation and future generations.\" Now some attacks: \"At the moment, Republicans don't seem focused on how to grow the economy and the middle class.\" Their current plans would \"do the opposite.\" He notes the recent decline in deficits. Now he is ticking off some accomplishments from his White House. \"If you add it all up, over the past 3.5 years,\" our economy is looking up. \"What this ll means is we've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis\" and begun to lay a new foundation for growth. \"And we should be proud of that, and on this five year anniversary we should take note of how far we've come.\" \"But... we are not yet where we want to be... We need to grow faster, we need better paying jobs, we need more broad-based prosperity, we need more ladders for people who are poor but want to get into the middle class.\" He ticks off statistics for the inequality in recent income growths . Now he is onto the financial crisis.\"It was five years ago this week that the financial crisis rocked Wall Street and sent an economy that was already in a recession into a tailspin.\" \"By the time I took office, the economy was shrinking by an annualized rate of 8%... it also laid bare the long erosion of the middle class\" that has worked \"harder and harder just to keep up.\" Most people don't recall the day Lehman went down, he says - they remember the day they got a pink slip. President Obama is beginning now. He first has a few words about the Navy Yard shooting, the cause for the speech delay - memorializing the victims and promising to help with the investigation. Just a few minutes now... The speech was scheduled to begin at 11:40. As of now, President Obama's economic speech is still on - despite a mass shooting (and ongoing criminal scene) a mile or so away from the White House at the Navy Yard. Here's the White House's preview of the president's speech: [T]he President will deliver remarks in the South Court Auditorium at the White House to mark the five-year anniversary of the financial crisis, discuss the progress we have made to grow the economy and create 7.5 million private sector jobs, and highlight the work we still need to do to strengthen the middle class and those fighting to get into it. He will continue to highlight his better bargain for the middle class, and warn against more self-inflicted wounds from Washington. He will be joined on-stage and in the audience by people who have benefited from his economic recovery proposals over the last five years including small business owners, construction workers, homeowners, consumers and tax cut recipients. It is unclear how or if this morning's shootings will change his presentation. And I'm handing over to my colleague Jim Newell in the US, to cover President Obama's speech on the US economy five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. GW Time for a summary of events so far today, ahead of President Obama's speech on the US economy (details) \u2022 World stock markets have rallied on the news last night that Larry Summers has ruled himself out of the race to replace Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve. European stock markets hit their highest levels since 2008, and Germany's DAX is on track for its record close (latest prices). Wall Street also opened higher. The rally was driven by predictions that Janet Yellen, current Fed vice-chair, will replace Bernanke. Yellen is seen as a more dovish replacement than Summers, and less likely to aggressively slow America's stimulus programme. City economists say Yellen is a highly qualified replacement, and UK bookmakers reckon she's odds-on to claim the prize. \u2022 Summers ruled himself out last night, startling many analysts, in a blow to President Obama's plans. \u2022 Greece has been hit by protests, at the start of a week of industrial action. The country's schoolteachers began a five-day strike this morning, with thousands marching past the Athens parliament (photos here). \u2022 Greek teachers told our correspondent that planned job cuts go too far. \u2022 There were also clashes between school guards and riot police in Athens. Several people were hospitalised after police used tear gas to break up protests at a government ministry. \u2022 Europe's top central banker, Mario Draghi, warned that the region's recovery remained 'fragile'. The head of the European Central Bank also told German business leaders that politicians must push on with implementing economic reforms. \u2022 Greece slid deeper into deflation, with prices falling by 1% year-on-year. \u2022 Barclays admitted it faces a \u00a350m fine over the way it raised funds from Qatari investors in 2008. The bank is fighting the charges. World stock markets continue to show solid gains today. Europe's stocks remain at five-year highs, with the German DAX on track for its highest close here. Here's a snapshot of Europe's stock markets, as the trading day heads for the close. The waves of green electronic ink shows how markets from London to Athens are higher: Michael Hewson, senior markets analyst at CMC Markets in the City, says shares are rising on a \"Summers breeze\" -- relief that former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers won't replace Ben Bernanke at the Fed. Hewson explains: European markets surged today on the back of reduced Syrian tensions, as well as the \u201cYellen put\u201d as Larry Summers the front runner to replace outgoing Fed chairman Ben Bernanke pulled his candidacy for the post due to concerns that the confirmation process would be acrimonious and could be damaging to the US administration. Janet Yellen is widely perceived as being the heir to Bernanke\u2019s legacy and the continuity she would bring to US monetary policy, as opposed to the uncertainty that would surround a Larry Summers candidacy. While markets are celebrating now there is a danger that in thinking that Yellen is a shoo-in, the US president in being thwarted in his desire for Summers could well overlook Yellen in preference to an alternative candidate. There had been widespread speculation that a Summers announcement could well have taken place this week, which would have removed some of the uncertainty surrounding Bernanke\u2019s replacement. Unless Yellen is confirmed quickly then attention will inevitably shift to how robust the current rally is if the President doesn\u2019t ratify the appointment quickly. Heads-up: President Obama is due to give a speech to mark the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers (on 15 September 2008). The speech will take place in the Rose Garden of the White House. President Obama will be joined by \"people that have benefited from his economic recovery proposals over the last five years,\" the White House said in a statement. That will include \"small business owners, construction workers, homeowners, consumers and tax cut recipients (USA Today reports). The speech comes as Obama limbers up for another tussle with Republicans over budget cuts. Yesterday, he insisted that Congress must raise the US debt ceiling again. America could hit its legal limit on borrowings in October, and some opponents in Washington are pushing for changes to his healthcare reforms in return for lifting the debt ceiling again. Encouraging economic news from America: US industrial output rose by 0.4% in August, driven by automobile production. That's the biggest monthly rise in six months, as America's factories bounced back after July (when production was unchanged). Manufacturing production rose 0.7%. Brett Ryan, US. economist at Deutsche Bank, explained that the figures may indicate a pick-up in global demand. Companies have to increase production in order to keep up with demand You have an elevated level of unfilled orders, so that bodes well for production. (quotes via Bloomberg) Today's markets rally continues to be driven by the prospect of the dovish Janet Yellen becoming the next chair of the Federal Reserve (she's the odds-on favourite - see here) Louise Cooper, analyst at CooperCity, believes Yellen would do a fine job, and also bring some much-needed gender balance to central banking. She writes: I am a big fan of the immense intellect that is Dr Yellen. In its 100 years, the Fed has never been led by a woman and President Obama could make history with the choice of Dr Yellen. She is married to the economist George Akerlof who has won a Nobel Prize. She is the female half of a serious power couple. With a PhD in economics from Yale University and a previous career as Professor of economics at University of California at Berkeley, she has academic credentials aplenty. No one can doubt her immense intelligence but critics have questioned her gravitas although to me this is secret sexism - just because she does not act like a man she is unsuitable for the job. Clearly not. But the fact Yellen is even being considered is a feat in itself as central banking is still an old boy\u2019s club, Cooper adds: The new Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney may have assuaged feminists with his choice of Jane Austen for the ten pound note, but his Monetary Policy Committee is female free. Out of the six members of the Executive Board at the European Central Bank, none have double X chromosomes either. And not one women heads up a central bank in any of the 28 EU member states. The Bank of Japan has Sayuri Shirai as one of the nine members of its Policy Board. But surprisingly, it is in Russia that a female head of a central bank is to be found. Elvira Nabiullina took office in June of this year after her appointment by President Putin \u2013 not a man known for his feminist views. When asked about being one of the few female central bankers in the world Dr Yellen said \"I really think this is something we're going to see increase over time, and it's time for that to happen.\" Let's hope it starts with her being appointed as the world's most powerful central banker. A good place to start. Wall Street is open, and traders are joining in the market rally driven by Larry Summers' withdrawal from the race for the Federal Reserve chair last night (see opening post). Reports this morning that France, Britain and the United States have agree to seek a \"strong and robust\" UN resolution over Syria's chemical weapons (see our Middle East liveblog) is also pushing markets up. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 153 points, or almost 1%, to 15527. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are also up (round-up to follow). Meanwhile in Glasgow, business secretary Vince Cable has launched a no-holds-barred attack on his Conservative colleagues in Britain's coalition government. As my colleague Andrew Sparrow reports, Cable told the Liberal Democrat party conference that Tory policies were \"nasty\", \"ugly\", \"ludicrous\" and \"deeply opportunistic\". More here. We now have photos of today's march by Greek teachers in Athens (this is separate from the scuffles between riot police and school guards we reported on at 10.58am). They confirm that the march was well-attended, which suggests Greece could be heading into an autumn of discontent (check out Helena Smith's dispatch from Athens for the details) Some lunchtime fun: the Wall Street Journal has created an interactive which lets you build a German coalition government (something Germany's politicians will probably be wrestling with in a week's time). It's here: The Koalitionsautomat: the German Coalition Builder Helpfully, it explains which potential combinations are and aren't likely, and why.... Ireland's finance minister has hinted that the Irish economy is growing again, just days before new GDP data shows whether its recession is actually over. Reuters has the details: Evidence points to Ireland's economy having returned to growth in the second quarter after disappointing data earlier in the year, Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on Monday. But Ireland must make sufficient cuts in next year's budget, due next month, to ensure a return to a primary surplus,Noonan told reporters at a party meeting southwest of Dublin. \"All the anecdotal evidence would suggest an economy turning to growth,\" Noonan said when asked about official figures for the second quarter due on Thursday. It's official: Barclays is braced for a \u00a350m fine over its 2008 fundraising from Qatari investors, although it isn't backing down over the issue either. The admission comes in its \u00a35.9bn rights issue prospectus, which just hit the wires. Here's its full prospectus. The potential fine refers to certain \"advisory services agreements\" taken out between Barclays and Qatar, over which the Financial Conduct Authority filed \"Warning Notices\" against the bank last Friday. As my colleague Jill Treanor flags up, Barclays is fighting the possible fine. And here's the key section of the prospectus: The Warning Notices conclude that Barclays and Barclays Bank were in breach of certain disclosure-related Listing Rules and Barclays was also in breach of Listing Principle 3 (the requirement to act with integrity towards holders and potential holders of the Company\u2019s shares). In this regard, the FCA considers that Barclays and Barclays Bank acted recklessly. The financial penalty in the Warning Notices against the Group is \u00a350 million. However, Barclays and Barclays Bank continue to contest the findings. The Serious Fraud Office is investigating the same agreements. Its investigation is at an earlier stage and the Group has received and continues to respond to requests for further information. The DOJ and the SEC are undertaking an investigation into whether the Group\u2019s relationships with third parties who assist Barclays to win or retain business are compliant with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They are also investigating the agreements referred to above including the two advisory services agreements. The US Federal Reserve has requested to be kept informed of these matters. It is not possible to estimate the full impact on the Group if the final conclusion of these matters is adverse. Heads-up: Barclays has told investors that income at its investment banking arm in July and August was \"significantly below\" the levels seen a year ago,. The weaker performance wiped 5% off its total income for the first eight months of this year. The news comes as it releases its much-anticipated rights issue prospectus (Barclays is raising \u00a36bn to improve its capital reserves). Here's the announcement (which, unlike last week's one, does not include any rogue links to Idaho cattle ranches). The Bank of England is touring the UK, holding roadshows to promote its plan to replace Britain's paper banknotes with plastic alternatives. They're in Gateshead today, having kicked off in the refined environs of Oxford on Friday - where my colleague Katie Allen watched events unfold. She writes: Stephen Barratt, an accountant from Oxford, is unimpressed. He rubs the polymer dummy between his fingers with a look of disgust. \"It's the feel. I can see the practical advantages but paper is much nicer. I don't like them personally \u2026 The fact paper notes age is actually quite nice,\" he says. More than 650 people handle the notes before the day is out. Questions range from the environmental impact to washability. Justin Gunson, a 29-year-old magician, is keen to see how the notes handle as well as other possible professional challenges. \"As a magician you want to know if you can mark them, if you can use fake ones.\" The Bank has more than a dozen roadshows planned (unless local conjurers relieve them of the prototypes first). More here: British shoppers get to grips with Bank of England's polymer notes Back to Greece, and Greek unions say that more than 40,000 civil servants took part in the central Athens demonstration today. Participation in strike action is reckoned to be 95% - a very high figure given that strikers lose their salaries when they walk off the job. Angeliki Fatourou of the OLME union (which represents workers in education) told our correspondent Helena Smith that: It's been a huge success. And indicative of what the government and troika can expect in the coming weeks and months ahead. As flagged up earlier, Greece's Troika of international lenders return to Athens next week..... A quick markets update. European stock markets remain buoyant following Larry Summers' decision to withdraw from the race to succeed Ben Bernanke as head of the Federal Reserve. \u2022 FTSEurofirst 300: up 9.5 points at 1259, a new five-year high \u2022 FTSE 100: up 59 points at 6643, a five-week high \u2022 German DAX: up 103 points at 8613, an all-time high \u2022 French CAC: up 32 points at 4146, highest since February 2011 Some financial analysts reckon that the market reaction is overblown. After all, Ben Bernanke has already outlined the conditions under which the Fed would slow its stimulus programme. Would Janet Yellen really be a dramatically different prospect to Summers? Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities thinks not. Here's his reasoning: The markets should not assume that other candidates to lead the Fed will deviate far from the timetable for 'tapering' QE3 that Mr Bernanke has outlined. Ms Yellen, whose chances of taking the Chairmanship will appear to have improved with Prof Summers' withdrawal, may be of a generally 'dovish' disposition. But she has not dissented from the Bernanke schedule nor has she released any public comment recently about economic growth or unemployment that suggests she might look with favour on a more accommodative policy-course than the FOMC consensus currently approves. There remains the mystery of why President Obama has appeared reluctant to nominate Yellen already. Lewis adds: Dark rumours of personal frictions during the Clinton Administration abound but, politically, a Yellen appointment would probably be the easiest course for the President to pursue. He could at least count on most of the Democrats in the Senate being on his side. Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith reports that passions are on the rise as striking workers, starting with teachers, kick off a week of industrial action in the debt-stricken country. She also confirms that several people were taken to hospital after riot police used tear gas this morning. After a slow-motion summer, Greek unions are back in action organising protests and walk-outs with a vengeance. Outrage over government plans to pare back the bloated public sector boiled over at 7 AM this morning when a week of strikes got off the ground with police firing tear gas at demonstrating school guards amassed outside the administrative reform ministry. Three protestors were subsequently rushed to hospital suffering respiratory problems. The decision of authorities to resort to using toxic chemicals so early in the day appears only to have reinforced the resolve of unions in both the public and private sector to step up action against the reforms now being asked of Greece by the EU and IMF. \u201cIt\u2019s just made us more mad,\u201d said Angeliki Fatourou, a leading member of the secondary school teachers union OLME which kicked off five-day rolling strikes today. \u201cPlease note that we will not rest easily. This will be the mother of strikes and teachers will lead the way.\u201d As Helena writes, thousands of teachers, from both secondary and primary sectors, are marching towards the parliament building in Syntagma square in a massive display of opposition over reforms that will see some 12,500 civil servants being transferred to a mobility scheme, widely seen as shorthand for dismissal, by the end of the year. \"The cuts really are the last straw,\" said Fatourou insisting that most public schools no longer had enough money to pay heating, electricity or water bills. ADEDY, the umbrella group representing civil servants nationwide, has also called on its 42 federations to go on strike later this week. The 48-hour walkout, Wednesday and Thursday, comes ahead of crucial meetings Friday and Saturday that will decide whether industrial action will continue across the public sector. \u201cAt the moment different sectors are backing the idea of strike action with varying degrees of intensity,\u201d ADEDY\u2019s Tania Karayiannis told me this morning. \u201cBut that is expected to change. Greeks in both the public and private sector have been pushed to the absolute brink. This will be a very hot week that should be seen as a prelude to a very hot winter,\u201d she said. Visiting inspectors representing Greece's international creditors will almost certainly be given a baptism of fire when they arrived in Athens to begin what will be the most crucial review, yet, of the Greek economy next Monday. This video clip appears to show those reported clashes outside Greece's Ministry of Administrative Reforms between school guards and riot police this morning (see 10.56am onwards): That's via the Keep Talking Greece website, which reports that demonstrators held a sit-down protest in the middle of the road outside the ministry, prompting riot police to move them. And here's a photo of teachers on strike in Crete: Greek schoolteachers have gathered in force in the city of Thessaloniki for today's walkout, as these tweets from local resident Antonis Gazakis show: That's via university lecturer Spyros Gkelis. He also flags up that there is reportedly a high turnout across the country from Greece's school teachers for today's strike. Over in Greece, a week of industrial action has begun with schoolteachers downing tools, and reports of clashes between school guards and riot police in Athens. Greek secondary school teachers launched a five-day strike this morning, in protest at the government's plans to cut thousands of jobs, and transfer staff to its unpopular 'mobility scheme' [from where employees can be forced to take a new job or be laid off]. It's likely to be the first in a series of 'rolling' strikes. According to local reports, Greek police fired teargas to disperse school guards who tried to enter the Administrative Reforms ministry in central Athens this morning, as the walkout got underway. One police official told Reuters: About 60 to 70 school guards tried to enter the building to occupy it and were pushed back by police. School guards are responsible for patroling educational premises, and also operate road crossings for pupils. Here's Associated Press's early take: Riot police have scuffled with striking school guards outside a ministry in central Athens, as labor unions gear up for a series of public sector strikes over job cuts. Local media report Monday at least two demonstrators were transported to hospitals suffering from breathing problems after police used small amounts of pepper spray in an attempt to move protesters away from the Administrative Reform Ministry. Greece's government has pledged to ax thousands of public sector jobs in an effort to meet conditions of its international bailout. The country has been depending on rescue loans from the International Monetary Fund and other European countries that use the euro currency since May 2010. Today's walkout is the prelude to a major 48-hour walkout, starting on Wednesday, called by Greece's main unions. Janet Yellen is the odds-on favourite to succeed Ben Bernanke this morning. A shoe-in, really, at just 1-8 with Paddy Power (so you'd get \u00a39 back for every \u00a38 you risked.) Tim Geithner, outgoing Treasury secretary, is an 8-1 shout, as is former Fed vice-chairman Donald Kohn. Stanley Fischer, who just stepped down from running Israel's central bank, is a 40-1 outsider. More details here. Larry Summers decision not to run for the Federal Reserve chair (see opening post onwards), is going to trigger a rally on Wall Street later today. Traders are calling the Dow Jones industrial average up by over 1%, as US investors give the thumbs up to the prospect of a more dovish Fed chair (although we still don't know who is going to actually replace Bernanke, of course) European stocks remain at five-year highs, and the US dollar is still down around 0.5% on the currency markets. Summers' decision could give the US economy a small boost , tweets economic policy analyst Alan Tonelson: Eurozone inflation fell to just 1.3% (annual basis) last month, data just released from Eurostat confirmed. That's a drop from July's reading of 1.6% (for the consumer prices index), further away from the European Central Bank's target of just below 2%. That shows there's no pressure on the ECB to raise rates, or change its commitment to leave them at present levels, or lower, for an extended period. The data confirmed that Greece remains in deflationary territory, with prices falling by 1.0% year-on year. Bulgaria (-0.7%) and Latvia (-0.1%) also showed the lowest rates. The highest eurozone inflation figures were seen in Estonia (3.6%), the Netherlands (2.8%) and Romania (2.6%), with the UK also reporting inflation of 2.8% last month. This may please Mario Draghi -- as the ECB chief began his speech, Italy reported that its trade surplus has widened Imports fell 0.3% year-on-year in July, while exports jumped by 3.0% compared with July 2012 - the first rise in exports in three months. This pushed the Italian trade surplus up to \u20ac5.948bn, up from \u20ac4.733bn a year ago. In another welcome sign of rebalancing, exports to non-EU countries were up by 3.5% (full details here) Draghi is also warning that eurozone governments must not slacken off the pace of reform - a familiar refrain for the ECB chief: Thanks to their consolidation efforts so far, the primary fiscal deficit for the euro area has fallen from 3.5% of GDP in 2009 to around 0.5% in 2012. This is projected to turn into a primary surplus from 2014 onwards. This improvement in public finances has helped send a signal to investors that government debt levels will stabilise and then fall in the future. This has been crucial in reassuring markets about debt sustainability. But the average public debt level in the euro area is still very high, at around 95% of GDP. This means that consolidation efforts need to be maintained in the years to come. Mario Draghi's Berlin speech is now online at the ECB's web site: click here It's called \u201cEurope and the Euro \u2013 A Family Affair\u201d*, and the key theme is that Europe needs growth to underpin its delicate recovery. As Draghi puts it: The recovery is only in its infancy. The economy remains fragile. And unemployment is still far too high. Draghi is reminding his audience of German small business owners that the eurozone faced\" difficult circumstances\" a year ago, with \"severe tensions in financial markets\" as investors feared the break-up of the euro. That threat has receded, he said, but Europe remains too weak: My main message is that we have made significant progress on the first step, stabilising the euro area. But there is still work to do to transform this achievement into higher growth and employment. Strengthening the euro area through sustainable policies, higher competitiveness and stronger common institutions is therefore our priority for today. The speech contained some familiar themes -- unemployment remains too high, and banking union remains incomplete. On competitiveness, Draghi actually hails the drop in wages in some eurozone countries: One way to regain competitiveness quickly is to address the numerator in unit labour costs \u2013 nominal wages. Another, longer-term approach is to increase the denominator \u2013 to achieve higher productivity. In my view, in the euro area today we need both. On the first count, there are already some encouraging signs of rebalancing in the euro area in terms of cost competitiveness. Thanks in part to the structural reforms introduced in several countries, relative costs are adjusting where they had become misaligned in the past. \u2022 - presumably the title is a reference Sly and the Family Stone, following Mark Carney's decision to name-check young UK singer-songwriter Jake Bugg last month. Over in Berlin, European central bank president Mario Draghi has begun giving a speech - here's the wire snaps off the Reuters terminal.... 16-Sep-2013 09:00 - ECB'S DRAGHI - EURO ZONE ECONOMY REMAINS FRAGILE, UNEMPLOYMENT FAR TOO HIGH 16-Sep-2013 09:00 - ECB'S DRAGHI - GIVEN SUBDUED INFLATION OUTLOOK, EXPECT KEY INTEREST RATES TO REMAIN AT CURRENT OR LOWER LEVELS FOR EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME 16-Sep-2013 09:00 - ECB'S DRAGHI - BANKING UNION SHOULD HELP SPEED UP THE REPAIR OF BANKS - THAT IS IF, AS I HOPE, WE END UP WITH A STRONG SINGLE RESOLUTION MECHANISM Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale dubs today's market action the \"Larry Rally\", and puts his finger firmly on the causes of the buoyant financial markets -- easy money. From his morning note to clients: Five (long) years on from Lehman\u2019s collapse, and while the global economy is still struggling to find its feet, financial markets are riding high. This morning\u2019s catalyst may be Larry Summers\u2019 decision to withdraw from consideration for the Fed Chairmanship, but the real driver is easy monetary policy. Of course. June saw a huge market blood-letting as \u2018tapering\u2019 was priced in, and the period since then has seen outflows from emerging markets and bond funds slow, markets calm down. The issue is how long the risk party can last as talk of tapering becomes reality and before the focus switches firmly to when and how fast the Federal Reserve actually tightens policy. The Fed's monetary policy committee meets on Wednesday night, so we might not have long to wait..... Britain's borrowing costs have dropped this morning, following Larry Summers' decision. The yield on 10-year gilts has dropped to 2.86% , from 2.91% on Friday night, as traders rush to buy UK debt (pushing up the price, and thus lowering the interest rate on the bond). US Treasuries have also strengthened, driving down yields on America's 10-year bonds by a chunky 8 basis points to 2.812%, from 2.9% on Friday. The message from the markets is clear -- they expect a less hawkish Fed chair than Summers.... Germany's DAX index hit a new record high this morning -- nudging 8,601 points in the opening minutes of trading. The FTSeurofirst 300 index of Europe's biggest companies has just hit a new five year high, driven by the prospect of the dovish Janet Yellen becoming the next Fed chair. It has jumped 0.58% to 1,260.35, a level not seen since June 2008 -- three months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Here's the details of the European markets this morning, following Asia's rally (see 7.51am) Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains that recent progress in Syria is also boosting the markets - along with the first election results from Germany (of which more shortly.....) Investors are reacting positively to news that the more hawkish Larry Summers has withdrawn from the race to be the next Fed chair in Jan (not enough support from Obama\u2019s Democrats), paving the way for the more accommodative vice-chair Janet Yellen. Markets are not worried about tapering per se, rather the speed of it, seeing Yellen reduce bond buying more slowly and leave rates lower for longer. Sentiment is also helped by news of deal between US &amp; Russia over Syria\u2019s chemical weapons surrender. German Chancellor Merkel\u2019s sister party won the Bavarian election which bodes well for her to keep her position in next week\u2019s general election. Europe's stock markets are open, and the news that Larry Summers won't be the next Fed chair is pushing shares higher. The prospect of an \" even more dovish chairman at the helm of the world\u2019s most pivotal central bank\" than Ben Bernanke, as Chris Weston of IG puts it, is giving markets a lift. The FTSE 100 jumped 1% at the start,and is now up 50 points at 6633. Italy's FTSE MIB has also gained 1%, with other indexes jumping at least 0.8%. So why the rally? It's all about Janet Yellen, the new favourite to replace Bernanke. As Weston explains, Yellen could potentially have quit the Fed altogether if Summers got the top job, depriving the Fed of one of its most dovish members: Life with Larry Summers at the helm would have potentially been very different from life under Ben Bernanke; it\u2019s these uncertainties that keep markets held back. In theory if Larry Summers had got the job, we could easily have seen Janet Yellen step down from the Fed and return to academia, which would have had negative ramifications on the composition of the Fed in Q2 2014, with the board not just losing a key note dove, but also its last voting female. This has now changed, and while we know Donald Kohn has been interviewed, if Janet Yellen doesn\u2019t get the job there could be an outcry given a large number of democrats and certainly market participants have been campaigning for her appointment. Larry Summers' withdrawal may be good news for investors who don't want America's stimulus programme to end, but it's a blow to President Obama. As our Washington bureau chief, Dan Roberts, explained last night: Barack Obama's hopes of a smooth transition of power at the US Federal Reserve were dealt a significant blow on Sunday night when Larry Summers unexpectedly pulled out of the running to replace Ben Bernanke when he stands down in January. Summers, a former Treasury secretary under President Clinton, had been frontrunner to take charge of US monetary policy during a crucial phase in the economic recovery but is understood to have been deterred by the prospect of bumpy Senate confirmation hearings. Despite an impeccable track record as an economist and policymaker, Summers remains widely associated with the period of laissez-faire economic policy-making that led up to the banking crash and his decision to step aside on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the crisis shows how raw the politics remain in Washington.

Here's an agenda: \u2022 Mario Draghi gives speech in Berlin - from 10am CET (9am BST). Details \u2022 Eurozone inflation data for August: 11am CET (10am BST) \u2022 Troika begin review of Portugal's bailout programme - all day \u2022 Greek teachers strike over austerity cutbacks - all day \u2022 Italian trade data - 10am CET (9am BST) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. European stock markets are set to rally this morning following the surprise news last night that Larry Summers, former US Treasury secretary, has withdrawn from the race to become the next chairman of the US Federal Reserve. The former US Treasury secretary threw in the towel yesterday, seemingly daunted by the prospect of a bruising fight with Congress. The move throws the race to succeed Ben Bernanke wide open, with the Fed on the very brink of deciding whether to begin slowing its huge monetary stimulus programme. The new front-runner appears to be Janet Yellen, Fed vice-chair since 2010 - a popular choice with Democrats and many in the financial markets and the media. As well as having helped guided Fed policy through the crisis, Yellen is credited with a rare knack of reading economic trends -- including predicting in 2009 that the recovery would be \"frustratingly slow\". Economists and analysts believe Yellen is more likely than Summers to maintain a robust stimulus programme, meaning more easy money for Wall Street and the City. Summers' withdrawal has already hit the dollar, driving sterling to its highest level since January. The pound is up by 0.8 cents this morning, to $1.59.5. Emerging markets have rallied overnight, with Thailand's stock market up almost 3% and India up 1%. European stocks are expected to surge too, while bond yields should probably slide -- on the prospect of the Fed buying even more US debt than under Larry Summers. IG is calling the FTSE 100 up 72 points at 6655, the DAX up 131 points at 8640, and the CAC up 57 points at 4171. I'll be tracking all the news through the day, as usual....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rebel Democrats on Monday threw their weight behind a growing campaign for Janet Yellen to take over the US Federal Reserve, as their successful revolt against White House pick Larry Summers emboldened those calling for tougher policy toward Wall Street. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of four banking committee members who helped force Summers, a former Citigroup adviser, to withdraw from the race on Sunday, said the development should give President Barack Obama a chance to rethink his strategy, which has been criticised for being too accommodating toward banking interests. \"I don't think it's any secret that Larry was not my first choice,\" said Warren. \"I think the president is taking his time, he's thinking through this and we're having a good and thoughtful discussion, which is a good thing to have in Washington.\" Summers was treasury secretary under President Clinton. He is seen by his opponents as being heavily implicated in the lax regulatory environment which helped caused the banking crash. On the fifth anniversay of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the race to succeed the current Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, has become a symbol of the political battle in Washington over how to rein in the power of financial interests. Yellen, who is currently vice chair of the Federal Reserve, is seen as much less close to Wall Street than Summers. She is also favoured by those who would like to see more women in Obama's inner circle. \"Janet Yellen, I hope, will make a terrific Federal Reserve chair,\" said Warren, in an interview on MSNBC. \"I hope she's nominated. She has great experience, she has great judgment. I think she would make a terrific federal reserve chair. The president will make his decision but I hope that happens.\" Paradoxically, US financial markets rose on the news that Summers had withdrawn his candidacy; Summers had been expected to oppose fresh economic stimulus if he made it through the Senate confirmation process. Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at broker BTIG, said investors were betting that Yellen would look more favorably on the continuation of the Fed's massive financial stimulus programme, known as quantitative easing (QE). Yellen has backed Bernanke in his plans to extend the $85bn-a-month bond-buying programme that is aimed at stimulating the economy and keeping interest rates down. Summers had been perceived as being more critical. The Fed meets this week and Bernanke will hold a press conference on Wednesday, at which he is expected to be pressed on his own plans, the future of QE and likely successors. \"The irony is that Summers is not being dropped because he was in favor of tightening monetary policy,\" said Greenhaus. \"He is being dropped because of his perceived bias towards deregulation. The funny thing is we don't know where Yellen stands on bank regulatory policy and that's going to be just as important as monetary policy in the coming years.\" Liberals in Washington welcomed Summers' shock departure from the race, which is the latest congressional setback for an Obama administration that is rapidly losing support even from its own party. \"Larry Summers' past decisions to deregulate Wall Street and do the bidding of corporate America have made the lives of millions of Americans more acrimonious. He would have been an awful Fed chair,\" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \"President Obama should appoint someone to lead the Fed who has not accepted millions in payments from Wall Street, and who will prioritize an economy that works for the little guy above further enrichment for the big guy.\" The whispering campaign against Summers echoed a Senate backlash last year, at Obama's attempt to nominate Susan Rice as secretary of state, and comes as his failure to secure congressional backing for military strikes against Syria risks further weakening his political capital in Washington. Writing to Obama to explain his decision to pull out, Summers acknowledged that he would have faced a bumpy ride from the Senate. \"This is a complex moment in our national life,\" he wrote. \"I have reluctantly concluded than any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and would not serve the interests of the Federal Reserve, the Administration, or ultimately, the interests of the nation's ongoing economic recovery. \"I look forward to continuing to support your efforts to strengthen our national economy by creating a broad-based prosperity and to reform our financial system so that no president ever again faces what you and your economic team faced upon taking office in 2009.\"",

      "body": "<p>Is President Obama the victim of bad economic advice?</p> <p>The evidence points to \"yes\". The president's economic initiatives \u2013 food stamps, manufacturing, infrastructure, raising the debt ceiling, appointing a new chairman of the Federal Reserve \u2013 have mostly ended in either neglect or shambles. After five years, the Obama Administration's stated intentions to improve the fortunes of the middle class, boost manufacturing, reduce income inequality, and promote the recovery of the economy have come up severely short.</p> <p>Despite this, the president believes he is negotiating his economic agenda with Congress from a position of strength, and almost every speech includes some self-congratulatory note about how far the economy has come. </p> <p>Most recently, when answering the withdrawal letter of Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary and Harvard president who was an unofficially named candidate for chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president claimed that Summers was instrumental to turning the current economy into what the rest of us must have missed: <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/09/15/obama-statement-on-lawrence-summers/\">a world of butterflies and unicorns</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Larry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because of his expertise, wisdom, and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today.</p> </blockquote> <p>The kind of progress we are seeing today? The mind boggles: what progress is that?</p> <p>Here's the litany of failure: the president has not pushed through any major stimulus bill since 2009, and most of that was <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904716604576544500632493510.html\">pork-barrel junk</a>. Manufacturing is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/24/us-manufacturing-troubled-promise-reshoring\">weak and weakening</a>; the employment gap between the rich and the poor is the <a href=\"http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/09/16/employment-gap-between-rich-poor-widest-on-record/#.UjcNi-DzRlY.twitter\">widest on record</a>; the economic recovery is actually more like an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/29/economic-recovery-not-real\">extended stagnation</a> with 12 million people unemployed; the housing \"recovery\" will be stalled as long as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2013/sep/13/high-mortgage-interest-rates-economic-recovery\">incomes are low and house prices are high</a>; and quantitative easing as a stimulus, while a heroic independent effort by the Federal Reserve, is past its due date and is no longer improving the country's fortunes<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/06/bad-economic-stimulus-quantitative-easing\"> beyond the stock market</a>.</p> <p>Shall we continue? We don't have a food stamp bill even though 49 million Americans<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/10/obama-syria-what-about-sequester\"> lack regular access to food</a>. Goldman Sachs analysts have said the sequester is taking a toll on stubbornly growing unemployment: \"since sequestration took effect in March, federal job losses have been somewhat more pronounced,\" they wrote last week; and another debt ceiling controversy \u2013 the third of Obama's presidency \u2013 looms in only a few weeks with the potential to hurt what meager economic growth we can still cling to.</p> <p>The president could not be more wrong or misleading in the way in which he presents our economic progress. One can perfectly understand <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/scary-thought-on-labor-day-weekend-obamas-economic-team-think-they-are-doing-a-good-job\">economist Dean Baker's horror </a>when he realized, back in August, that Obama's economic team believes it is doing a good job. </p> <p>It's time to end the delusion that this White House has accomplished even a fraction of what it should be doing to help the economy. It should have been focusing all its efforts on employment, perhaps by boosting job-retraining programs, providing tax incentives for employers or supporting a comprehensive infrastructure effort. Instead, the administration is falling victim to political distractions and lack of follow-through and wasting its meager political capital on the wrong fights.</p> <p>The latest example is the<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/09/15/full-text-of-summers-letter-withdrawing-from-fed-consideration/\"> debacle around Larry Summers</a>. The week leading up to his exit was a rough one, as no fewer than three important senators \u2013 Jeff Merkley, Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester \u2013 openly stated that they would not vote for Summers when his name came in front of the Senate Banking Committee. Another member of the committee, Elizabeth Warren, was opposed to Summers as well, and two other senators \u2013 Dianne Feinstein and Dick Durbin \u2013 signed a letter begging Obama to choose someone else.</p> <p>Given the ferocity of the opposition, the main surprise today is not why Summers is pulling his name from consideration, but how his candidacy ever got this far. The usually genteel (or at least passive-aggressive) profession of economics is not one given to activism. Yet, when Summers' name came up, the White House was inundated with petitions: 20 senators <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/11/news/economy/economists-yellen-fed/index.html\">opposing his nomination this summer</a>, 300 economists (300!) <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/11/news/economy/economists-yellen-fed/index.html\">uniting against him</a>. Wherever the president turned, it would have been abundantly clear to him that tying his fortunes to Summers would have been akin to tying two rocks together to see if they float. Instead, Obama listened to his \"<a href=\"http://blogs.rollcall.com/hawkings/biggest-threat-to-u-s-economy-is-congress-bernanke/\">trusted economic advisers</a>\", who have again, as they have for years, failed to read the room correctly. </p> <p>The president's economic team has changed over the past few years, but currently consists of chief economic adviser Gene Sperling, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, Jason Furman at the Council of Economic Advisers and Office of Management and Budget director Sylvia Matthews Burwell. Fill another mug for Tim Geithner (who has left government but apparently is deputized to help Obama pick the new chair of the Federal Reserve) and several others. The assumption, at least going by the gossip from \"senior administration officials\" is that the team, which has worked together since the Clinton years more or less, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-28/summers-pick-fits-obama-s-preference-for-beaten-path.html?cmpid=hpbv\">supported Summers to get the band together again</a>. </p> <p>The idea, apparently, was that with a sufficient quorum, this merry band of (mostly) brothers could, through the magic of their sheer collected brilliance and perhaps a few incantations, recreate the booming economic magic of the Clinton years in the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Apparently the addition of Janet Yellen, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/16/janet-yellen-called-the-housing-bust-and-has-been-mostly-right-on-jobs-does-she-have-what-it-takes-to-lead-the-fed/\">an eminently qualified woman</a> \u2013 who, by the way, also worked with that Clinton team \u2013 would ruin the special magic of this team. Perhaps, with her <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/16/janet-yellen-called-the-housing-bust-and-has-been-mostly-right-on-jobs-does-she-have-what-it-takes-to-lead-the-fed/\">correct calls on housing and the economy</a>, she would interfere with the paralysis around fiscal policy and the budget that has plagued the White House for the past few years.

      "bodyText": "Is President Obama the victim of bad economic advice? The evidence points to \"yes\". The president's economic initiatives \u2013 food stamps, manufacturing, infrastructure, raising the debt ceiling, appointing a new chairman of the Federal Reserve \u2013 have mostly ended in either neglect or shambles. After five years, the Obama Administration's stated intentions to improve the fortunes of the middle class, boost manufacturing, reduce income inequality, and promote the recovery of the economy have come up severely short. Despite this, the president believes he is negotiating his economic agenda with Congress from a position of strength, and almost every speech includes some self-congratulatory note about how far the economy has come. Most recently, when answering the withdrawal letter of Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary and Harvard president who was an unofficially named candidate for chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president claimed that Summers was instrumental to turning the current economy into what the rest of us must have missed: a world of butterflies and unicorns: Larry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because of his expertise, wisdom, and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today. The kind of progress we are seeing today? The mind boggles: what progress is that? Here's the litany of failure: the president has not pushed through any major stimulus bill since 2009, and most of that was pork-barrel junk. Manufacturing is weak and weakening; the employment gap between the rich and the poor is the widest on record; the economic recovery is actually more like an extended stagnation with 12 million people unemployed; the housing \"recovery\" will be stalled as long as incomes are low and house prices are high; and quantitative easing as a stimulus, while a heroic independent effort by the Federal Reserve, is past its due date and is no longer improving the country's fortunes beyond the stock market. Shall we continue? We don't have a food stamp bill even though 49 million Americans lack regular access to food. Goldman Sachs analysts have said the sequester is taking a toll on stubbornly growing unemployment: \"since sequestration took effect in March, federal job losses have been somewhat more pronounced,\" they wrote last week; and another debt ceiling controversy \u2013 the third of Obama's presidency \u2013 looms in only a few weeks with the potential to hurt what meager economic growth we can still cling to. The president could not be more wrong or misleading in the way in which he presents our economic progress. One can perfectly understand economist Dean Baker's horror when he realized, back in August, that Obama's economic team believes it is doing a good job. It's time to end the delusion that this White House has accomplished even a fraction of what it should be doing to help the economy. It should have been focusing all its efforts on employment, perhaps by boosting job-retraining programs, providing tax incentives for employers or supporting a comprehensive infrastructure effort. Instead, the administration is falling victim to political distractions and lack of follow-through and wasting its meager political capital on the wrong fights. The latest example is the debacle around Larry Summers. The week leading up to his exit was a rough one, as no fewer than three important senators \u2013 Jeff Merkley, Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester \u2013 openly stated that they would not vote for Summers when his name came in front of the Senate Banking Committee. Another member of the committee, Elizabeth Warren, was opposed to Summers as well, and two other senators \u2013 Dianne Feinstein and Dick Durbin \u2013 signed a letter begging Obama to choose someone else. Given the ferocity of the opposition, the main surprise today is not why Summers is pulling his name from consideration, but how his candidacy ever got this far. The usually genteel (or at least passive-aggressive) profession of economics is not one given to activism. Yet, when Summers' name came up, the White House was inundated with petitions: 20 senators opposing his nomination this summer, 300 economists (300!) uniting against him. Wherever the president turned, it would have been abundantly clear to him that tying his fortunes to Summers would have been akin to tying two rocks together to see if they float. Instead, Obama listened to his \"trusted economic advisers\", who have again, as they have for years, failed to read the room correctly. The president's economic team has changed over the past few years, but currently consists of chief economic adviser Gene Sperling, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, Jason Furman at the Council of Economic Advisers and Office of Management and Budget director Sylvia Matthews Burwell. Fill another mug for Tim Geithner (who has left government but apparently is deputized to help Obama pick the new chair of the Federal Reserve) and several others. The assumption, at least going by the gossip from \"senior administration officials\" is that the team, which has worked together since the Clinton years more or less, supported Summers to get the band together again. The idea, apparently, was that with a sufficient quorum, this merry band of (mostly) brothers could, through the magic of their sheer collected brilliance and perhaps a few incantations, recreate the booming economic magic of the Clinton years in the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Apparently the addition of Janet Yellen, an eminently qualified woman \u2013 who, by the way, also worked with that Clinton team \u2013 would ruin the special magic of this team. Perhaps, with her correct calls on housing and the economy, she would interfere with the paralysis around fiscal policy and the budget that has plagued the White House for the past few years. Yellen, like Bernanke, would be no newcomer to picking up the slack left by a dysfunctional relationship between Congress and the president. That Obama economic team, like it or not, is in for more changes. As of this weekend (only 24 hours before Summers withdrew) Sperling, his biggest supporter, has said he will leave the administration. Even if Yellen does win the Fed job, that doesn't solve Obama's larger problem of having steered the economic conversation in the wrong direction for months. He has locked himself in a bubble in which he bases his relationship with his economic advisers on \"trust\" (code for familiarity) even when their advice is at odds with the ample evidence from the real world. To shut out the opposition to Summers, the president had to have been wearing earplugs. How closed is his economic circle? How well do they fit the profile of honest brokers about our economic situation? Loyalty is a great thing. But that kind of trust is clearly not working for Obama. Maybe he should stop relying on those he knows, and rely instead on those who know what they're doing.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Tony Abbott is on shaky ground when he holds up the typical household budget as an example for government", 
      "body": "<p>It is perhaps the most common <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22live+within%22+site%3Awww.tonyabbott.com.au&amp;oq=%22live+within%22+site%3Awww.tonyabbott.com.au&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.7492j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=%22live+within+its+means%22+site:www.tonyabbott.com.au&amp;start=0\">economic adage</a> used by Tony Abbott \u2013 that a government must live within its means, just like every household.</p> <p>Recently, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/11/what-if-a-typical-family-spent-like-the-federal-government-itd-be-a-very-weird-family/\">the Washington Post</a> examined what the average household would look like if it were the US government. So let\u2019s do it for the Australian context, because it rather highlights how the whole \u201cthe government should be like a household\u201d analogy is weak.</p> <p>The latest household income and income distribution data from <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6523.0Main+Features22011-12?OpenDocument\">the ABS</a> has the gross median household income at $75,000. We could use the median equivalised (after tax) income, but that is about $73,000 for a family of three and $86,000 for a family of four, so let\u2019s keep it simple and say this average household (call them the Murrays) earn $75,000 a year.</p> <p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2013/PEFO-2013\">income this year</a> is about $369bn and its expenses are $399bn, for a deficit of $30bn.</p> <p>This would mean the Murrays would spend $81,100 a year and put about $6,100 on their credit card. And, given the gross debt held by the Australian government is currently $275bn, that would mean the Murrays have $55,900 in debt.</p> <p>The problem for those thinking the government should be more like households is that the current average household debt in Australia, according to <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/business/breaking-news/australian-debt-high-but-still-safe/story-e6frfkur-1226685077555\">the Melbourne Institute,</a> is $151,488. The Reserve Bank estimates that the ratio of <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/chart-pack/household-sector.html\">household debt to disposable income is 147%.</a> If the Australian government were like the average Australian household, its debt would be almost double the size \u2013 about $542bn.</p> <p>So the analogy is breaking down already, but let\u2019s go further \u2013 how would the Murrays spend their $75,000?</p> <p>For a start they\u2019d spend $4,151 a year on defence. Unfortunately, it is not just to build a big fence; they\u2019re also <a href=\"http://parliamentflagpost.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/australias-military-involvement-in.html\">paying to send one of their sons to Afghanistan</a> to help their uncle Samuel. The son has now been there since 2001 and the Murrays have spent about $1,500 keeping him there.</p> <p>The good thing is they have built some submarines in the backyard to put in the moat that surrounds their house.</p> <p>The Murrays now spend $5,600 a year on education \u2013 or about 7.5%. Given the typical household spends only <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6530.0Main+Features12009-10?OpenDocument\">about 2.5% of its income on education,</a> this is certainly a jump. But mostly this is because the Murrays now have children in kindergarten, primary school, high school, university and TAFE college, all at the same time.</p> <p>The Murray family is also pretty sick, so they now spend $12,170, or 16.2%, on health compared to the usual household spend of 5.3% on medical care and expenses. But the average household normally spends 16.5% of their income on food and non-alcoholic drinks, so if we include that as health it looks like it\u2019s not too bad a trade-off.</p> <p>But the Murrays now spend $26,000 towards redistributing their income to the rest of the family. $10,300 of that is going to Grandma and Grandpa \u2013 good thing though is they had been putting money into a jar all their working life, which is helping pay for that.</p> <p>The big problem is a few in the family aren\u2019t working so they get $1,800 a year (2.4%) to help keep them afloat while they look for work. And 6.4% of the Murray\u2019s income goes towards those in the family with a disability \u2013 which isn\u2019t even included in the health bill.</p> <p>And $6,580 (8.8%) of the $75,000 is going to help out with raising the kids \u2013 childcare support and other \u201cfamily benefits\u201d.</p> <p>The Murrays now give $1,203 a year to foreigners for aid. That works out at 1.6%, which would make them slightly more generous than the average household, which gives away 1% of yearly expenditure to charity.</p> <p>Rather annoyingly, the Murrays now have no idea what the weather will be tomorrow, so they need to fund a bureau of meteorology to the tune of $66 a year.</p> <p>One good thing is the Murrays get to spend less on cars and fuel. They now only spend 3.5% on such things, whereas most homes in Australia spend about 15.6% of their expenditure buying cars, petrol and public transport. Luckily for the Murrays, their in-laws, Mr and Ms States, spend money on public transport. Unfortunately, the Murrays give them $9,600 a year (13%), so I guess they\u2019re chipping in for that as well.</p> <p>The Murrays do spend less on their home now. Only 2.2% goes toward their house and urban area development. Most households usually spend 18% on housing costs, like rent or mortgage payments and insurance and repairs.</p> <p>They\u2019re not having that much fun anymore though.

      "bodyText": "It is perhaps the most common economic adage used by Tony Abbott \u2013 that a government must live within its means, just like every household. Recently, the Washington Post examined what the average household would look like if it were the US government. So let\u2019s do it for the Australian context, because it rather highlights how the whole \u201cthe government should be like a household\u201d analogy is weak. The latest household income and income distribution data from the ABS has the gross median household income at $75,000. We could use the median equivalised (after tax) income, but that is about $73,000 for a family of three and $86,000 for a family of four, so let\u2019s keep it simple and say this average household (call them the Murrays) earn $75,000 a year. The government\u2019s income this year is about $369bn and its expenses are $399bn, for a deficit of $30bn. This would mean the Murrays would spend $81,100 a year and put about $6,100 on their credit card. And, given the gross debt held by the Australian government is currently $275bn, that would mean the Murrays have $55,900 in debt. The problem for those thinking the government should be more like households is that the current average household debt in Australia, according to the Melbourne Institute, is $151,488. The Reserve Bank estimates that the ratio of household debt to disposable income is 147%. If the Australian government were like the average Australian household, its debt would be almost double the size \u2013 about $542bn. So the analogy is breaking down already, but let\u2019s go further \u2013 how would the Murrays spend their $75,000? For a start they\u2019d spend $4,151 a year on defence. Unfortunately, it is not just to build a big fence; they\u2019re also paying to send one of their sons to Afghanistan to help their uncle Samuel. The son has now been there since 2001 and the Murrays have spent about $1,500 keeping him there. The good thing is they have built some submarines in the backyard to put in the moat that surrounds their house. The Murrays now spend $5,600 a year on education \u2013 or about 7.5%. Given the typical household spends only about 2.5% of its income on education, this is certainly a jump. But mostly this is because the Murrays now have children in kindergarten, primary school, high school, university and TAFE college, all at the same time. The Murray family is also pretty sick, so they now spend $12,170, or 16.2%, on health compared to the usual household spend of 5.3% on medical care and expenses. But the average household normally spends 16.5% of their income on food and non-alcoholic drinks, so if we include that as health it looks like it\u2019s not too bad a trade-off. But the Murrays now spend $26,000 towards redistributing their income to the rest of the family. $10,300 of that is going to Grandma and Grandpa \u2013 good thing though is they had been putting money into a jar all their working life, which is helping pay for that. The big problem is a few in the family aren\u2019t working so they get $1,800 a year (2.4%) to help keep them afloat while they look for work. And 6.4% of the Murray\u2019s income goes towards those in the family with a disability \u2013 which isn\u2019t even included in the health bill. And $6,580 (8.8%) of the $75,000 is going to help out with raising the kids \u2013 childcare support and other \u201cfamily benefits\u201d. The Murrays now give $1,203 a year to foreigners for aid. That works out at 1.6%, which would make them slightly more generous than the average household, which gives away 1% of yearly expenditure to charity. Rather annoyingly, the Murrays now have no idea what the weather will be tomorrow, so they need to fund a bureau of meteorology to the tune of $66 a year. One good thing is the Murrays get to spend less on cars and fuel. They now only spend 3.5% on such things, whereas most homes in Australia spend about 15.6% of their expenditure buying cars, petrol and public transport. Luckily for the Murrays, their in-laws, Mr and Ms States, spend money on public transport. Unfortunately, the Murrays give them $9,600 a year (13%), so I guess they\u2019re chipping in for that as well. The Murrays do spend less on their home now. Only 2.2% goes toward their house and urban area development. Most households usually spend 18% on housing costs, like rent or mortgage payments and insurance and repairs. They\u2019re not having that much fun anymore though. The usual household spends 13% on entertainment. But the Murrays now only spend $696 a year, or less than 1%, on recreation. They spend $169 a year on ABC and SBS, so at least they\u2019ve got two TV channels to watch. But the really great thing for the Murrays is they now print their own money. And bizarrely, even though for the past six years they have been spending more money than they\u2019ve earned, people all over the world still are willing to lend to them at cheap rates. So the Murrays can take out a 10-year loan for 3.86% \u2013 rather a bit below the 5.95% the average household has to pay for a mortgage. It\u2019s almost like people now think the Murrays will live forever and never die leaving debts unpaid! It also means that the Murray\u2019s debt repayments are only about 3% of their income. They love this because the RBA currently estimates the ratio of interest payments to household income is about 9.5%. So, bizarrely, the Australian government is actually better at living within its means than the typical household. Part of the reason is the ability to print its own money. This sounds great until you realise if you were to spend like the average household \u2013 i.e. lots of money on fun things and also on spiffying up the already nice McMansion \u2013 very quickly its money would become worthless. The Australian government might not be technically living within its means, but the last thing we should want is for it to start mimicking the typical household.",
