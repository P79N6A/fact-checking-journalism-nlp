      "bodyText": "Forget about the Christmas nut roast \u2013 those who don\u2019t eat meat are going to be spoilt for choice on 25 December as Britain\u2019s supermarkets roll out their biggest range of festive vegan and vegetarian food to date. Treats on offer include the first mince pies to be given the Vegan Society seal of approval, a vegan version of the Christmas classic Baileys, turmeric-spiced cauliflower wellington and mountains of new dairy-free cheeses. As the popular \u201cflexitarian\u201d trend continues to sweep the UK, major retailers such as Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer are hoping that even occasional carnivores might consider swapping their traditional turkey for an exotic vegan or vegetarian centrepiece. Flexitarianism has been one of the most striking food trends of 2017, with one in three people trying to reduce their meat intake. According to the Vegan Society, more than half of UK adults are now adopting \u201cvegan-buying behaviour\u201d, while the number of full-time vegans in the UK has grown four-fold in the past 10 years. Tesco has taken its commitment to meat- and dairy-free produce particularly seriously. It has hired the American chef and self-proclaimed \u201cplant pusher\u201d Derek Sarno \u2013 the former global executive chef for Whole Foods Market \u2013 as its \u201cdirector of plant-based innovation\u201d. Sarno has overseen the supermarket\u2019s biggest ever vegan and vegetarian Christmas offering this year, which has double the number of festive centrepieces compared with last year, including, for the first time, two vegan dinners \u2013 turmeric-spiced cauliflower wellington and, for those who cannot let go of their nut roast, a pecan and peanut roast with maple-roasted carrot and parsnip. As well as sprucing up Tesco\u2019s Christmas food, Sarno is working with suppliers, farmers and chefs on developing new plant-based foods that will go on sale over the coming year. \u201cThese are changing times and vegetable dishes have now become centrepiece heroes in their own right on dinner tables up and down the country,\u201d said Sarno. \u201cThis year, with the quality of vegetarian and vegan food now so good, there may even be squabbles across the dinner table over who gets what.\u201d Marks &amp; Spencer is showcasing more meat-free Christmas dinner main courses than meat-based ones, after its vegetarian range sold out in record time last year. The M&amp;S team has been inspired by chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi, Robin Gill and Deborah Madison, an American cookery teacher and chef who hails the use of pulses and beans. The retailer says it saw its biggest year for sales of vegetarian dishes last Christmas, while its Food to Order veggie dish sales were up 40% on 2015, and its butternut and sweet potato rosti became its bestselling vegetarian product ever. \u201cChristmas veg no longer needs to be over-cooked carrots and sprouts or a tasteless nut roast,\u201d said Helena Fleming, M&amp;S vegetarian meals product developer. \u201cIt\u2019s now as important as the turkey and pigs in blankets. The rise of the \u2018veggivore\u2019 and \u2018flexitarian\u2019 means that, as a country, we\u2019re experimenting more with new vegetables and we\u2019re less afraid to try something different.\u201d Asda is behind the first Vegan Society-approved mince pies and it predicts 18m will be eaten this Christmas. \u201cRetailers have picked up on the fact that labelling a product as vegan attracts many other people, proving that it\u2019s not just vegans who love vegan food,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the Vegan Society. \u201cThis year we have been impressed by the increasing number of festive products that are available to vegans. Most major supermarkets have created a selection of plant-based options, from advent calendars to vegan roasts.\u201d Last year, online grocer Ocado enjoyed a staggering 1,678% increase in sales within its \u201cvegan\u201d category on the year before. With the meat-free trend predicted to reach Christmas dinner tables this year, it is introducing a range of vegetarian and vegan centrepieces, including \u201cTofurkey\u201d roll, vegetarian nut roast and Christmas butternut squash stuffed with luxurious vegan mince. Next month, Ocado will trumpet the launch of the largest vegan food range of any UK supermarket, listing more than 90 new products, including a vegan egg replacer, soy-based tempeh, and jackfruit, a vegan substitute for pulled pork when marinated. Vegan cheeseboards include a Christmas platter from the Greek manufacturer Violife that is made up of three vegan cheese blocks \u2013 blu, cranberry after dinner and mature. It is selling out fast in Ocado and Sainsbury\u2019s and will be followed by a vegan feta next year. Finally, for those who fancy a tipple, the vegan version of Baileys Irish Cream, called Baileys Almande and made with almond milk, was recently launched in the US and can now be snapped up in the UK through Whole Foods Markets and thegoodnessproject.co.uk. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Much has been made of the extraordinary backflip this week by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, on the issue of a banking royal commission \u2013 from two weeks ago when he was telling Channel Nine\u2019s Karl Stefanovic that a royal commission \u201cdoesn\u2019t do anything other than write a report\u201d, to this week announcing one. But of course this isn\u2019t really a banking royal commission \u2013 it is instead a royal commission whose own framers see little need for it. It has been given just one year \u2013 a year less than was given to the trade union royal commission \u2013 and with terms of reference that are poorly focused, and which you could be excused for believing are designed to produce little change to our financial system. It is the weirdest announcement for a royal commission that I can recall. First there was the extraordinary fact that Turnbull announced the royal commission the very day the banks \u2013 the ones supposedly being investigated \u2013 asked him to set one up and even rather helpfully provided some advice on the terms of reference. And when announcing the commission, Turnbull barely gave any reason for doing so. Of course, were he to do so, he would be implicitly admitting that he was aware of concerns about the banking sector that were large and systemic enough to warrant a royal commission but that he had held off on calling for one. So instead of outlining the concerns about the banking industry, he talked about its concerns. He argued: \u201cwe have got to stop the banks and our financial services sector being used as a political football\u201d and that \u201cthe chief executives and chairman of the big four banks have written to us, asking the government to step in, end the uncertainty and ensure an orderly process that addresses the concerns\u201d. What those concerns were was not stated \u2013 which is a bit odd given that is generally the point of a royal commission. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, even described the royal commission as \u201cregrettable\u201d \u2013 not because of any alleged actions by the banking system but because \u201cpolitics is doing damage to our banking and financial system\u201d. The two men could hardly have done more to express a hope that the royal commission would not actually find any wrongdoing. And given that the draft terms of reference explicitly state that \u201cthe Commission is not required to inquire into, and may not make recommendations in relation to macro-prudential policy, regulation or oversight\u201d, there seems to be little desire for any practical outcome either. The terms of reference state that macro-prudential policy \u201cis policy and regulation, including as to the structure, role and purpose of financial regulators, that is concerned with containing systemic risk, which can have widespread implications for the financial system as a whole, beyond simply the banking system\u201d. So we have a royal commission into the financial system that \u201cmay not make recommendations\u201d into policy that can \u201chave widespread implication for the financial system\u201d. Sir Humphrey Appleby would be proud. Of course, as Katharine Murphy has noted, the only reason the prime minister announced this commission was because if he had not done so, enough National party MPs would have crossed the floor next week and voted for one \u2013 one that would probably not have had such a vague purpose in its terms of reference. And it is already clear the government\u2019s main desire out of this commission is for it to be as little as possible about the banks and instead all about the superannuation industry \u2013 specifically the industry super funds. The third point in the terms of reference asks the commission to inquire into \u201cthe use by a financial services entity of superannuation members\u2019 retirement savings for any purpose that does not meet community standards and expectations or is otherwise not in the best interest of members\u201d. That is a direct shot at industry super funds and claims they are used to benefit unions. Conservatives always have an issue with organisations set up by unions for the benefit of workers, that actually deliver those benefits. And industry super funds have consistently delivered results \u2013 annoyingly better results than retail super funds. The latest figures from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) show that the five-year annualised rate of return for retail funds is 7.5% compared with 9.8% for industry funds. Perhaps the commission could ask why that is the case. The banks have begun to agitate that the commission willprobably result in higher interest rates. This is something Martin Farrer noted as a possible outcome, should the commission suggest tighter lending standards. While that would probably cross the line into \u201cmacroprudential policy\u201d territory, it might not be much of a concern. The Australian Banking Association also suggests the commission will lead to higher interest rates because reputational risk might cause foreign lenders to charge more for Australian banks to borrow money from them. It\u2019s always been a bit of an odd argument that we shouldn\u2019t have a royal commission into the banking sector because it might make investors question the reputation of our financial system. As it is, the worry about high interest remains beholden to much more mundane economic and financial tangibles \u2013 such as rising US interest rates and the improving performance of our own economy. This week, the latest private capital expenditure figures were released, showing that for the first time since 2012, new private investment was greater than in the preceding year. While mining investment continues to fall (albeit by smaller amounts), the non-mining sector is more than making up for the slack. It means the end of the mining boom is now having little overall impact on the economy. This is good news before next week\u2019s release of the September quarter GDP figures. As the royal commission is designed to be a political fix, it will probably have only a small impact on the economy. One handy outcome for banks and the government will be that they can blame it if higher interest rates occur. The market still sees little sign of another rate rise for at least a year, and the reality is the government would like interest rates to go up, because for that to happen the economy would have to be humming along nicely.",

This is something <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/01/australias-banks-deserve-a-kicking-but-we-might-get-more-than-we-bargained-for\">Martin Farrer noted</a> as a possible outcome, should the commission suggest tighter lending standards. While that would probably cross the line into \u201cmacroprudential policy\u201d territory, it might not be much of a concern. </p> <p>The Australian Banking Association also <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/bank-royal-commission-will-lead-to-higher-interest-rates-anna-bligh-20171129-gzvne4\">suggests the commission will lead to higher interest rates</a> because reputational risk might cause foreign lenders to charge more for Australian banks to borrow money from them. </p> <p>It\u2019s always been a bit of an odd argument that we shouldn\u2019t have a royal commission into the banking sector because it might make investors question the reputation of our financial system.</p> <p>As it is, the worry about high interest remains beholden to much more mundane economic and financial tangibles \u2013 such as rising US interest rates and the improving performance of our own economy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/30/peter-dutton-says-royal-commission-a-chance-to-investigate-union-links-to-super-funds\">Peter Dutton says royal commission a chance to investigate union links to super funds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This week, the latest private capital expenditure figures were released, showing that for the first time since 2012, new private investment was greater than in the preceding year. While mining investment continues to fall (albeit by smaller amounts), the non-mining sector is more than making up for the slack. </p> <p>It means the end of the mining boom is now having little overall impact on the economy. </p> <p>This is good news before next week\u2019s release of the September quarter GDP figures. </p> <p>As the royal commission is designed to be a political fix, it will probably have only a small impact on the economy. One handy outcome for banks and the government will be that they can blame it if higher interest rates occur.</p> <p>The market <a href=\"http://www.asx.com.au/prices/targetratetracker.htm\">still sees little sign</a> of another rate rise for at least a year, and the reality is the government would like interest rates to go up, because for that to happen the economy would have to be humming along nicely.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The numbers in the US alone are astonishing: more than 53,000 people over 12 months; an average of 146 a day. This is the death toll from opioid overdoses last year, many of them from widely prescribed painkillers, such as tramadol, codeine and oxycodone. Donald Trump has declared America\u2019s opioid problem a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d as it spiralled into the deadliest drug epidemic in US history. Now the pharmaceutical industry, which has been heavily criticised for its role in the crisis, is seeking to address a disaster it helped create. Two companies are offering new monthly treatments for those hooked on powerful painkillers, with one approved by the US regulator last week. London-listed Indivior, which was spun out of Reckitt Benckiser in 2014, has developed a medication that is injected into the belly fat once a month \u2013 the world\u2019s first monthly treatment for opioid addiction. Sublocade contains buprenorphine, which was developed by Reckitt in Hull and takes away cravings without giving a high. The new medication, which is set to hit the US market early next year, is designed to create a steady state in the patient without withdrawal symptoms (nausea, itching, the shakes), thereby reducing the chance of relapse while receiving counselling and support. Indivior is also in talks with regulators in the UK, Australia, Canada, Sweden and Germany about having Sublocade approved. Paul Cuddon, analyst at stockbroker Numis, said: \u201cSadly, it is not a perfect cure, but does appear to significantly increase the abstinence rate in hard-to-treat patients. Coupled with psychosocial support and better awareness of the dangers of prescribing opioids, this epidemic can be brought under control.\u201d Elsewhere in the industry, another injectable treatment that can be given weekly or monthly has been developed by Swedish firm Camurus and licensed to private-equity-owned Braeburn Pharmaceuticals of the US. The advisory panel for the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended approval for some of the proposed doses, asking for more data on the higher doses. The regulator\u2019s decision is due in mid-January. Braeburn says the medication can suppress patient withdrawals within an hour after the first dose. Indivior and Braeburn are trying to tackle a massive problem. Almost 12 million adults misused opioids in the US last year and more than 2.5 million were diagnosed with opioid-use disorder; yet only 1.1 million received treatment. In England, the number of patients admitted to hospital for overdosing on opioid painkillers doubled in the past decade, to 11,660 last year. Opioid prescriptions doubled to 24 million in 2016, according to NHS Digital figures. The Indivior and Braeburn drugs are an opportunity for the drug industry to atone for its aggressive push of opioids as the go-to medication for pain. It is facing a wave of litigation: a county in New York state has sued Purdue Pharma, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Teva and Endo over their marketing of opioids. At least 30 lawsuits have been filed against doctors, pharmacists and drug wholesalers in West Virginia alone, which has the highest overdose death rate in the nation (and the second-highest unemployment rate). Opioid overdoses have become the leading cause of death in Americans under 50 \u2013 four people are dying from them every hour. At the root of the crisis are overprescriptions of opioid painkillers \u2013 drugs derived directly from the opium poppy or made synthetically \u2013 for anything from cancer to severe back pain, arthritis and sports injuries. Aside from the human cost, the cost to the US economy was estimated at $504bn in 2015, and since then the crisis has worsened. Shaun Thaxter, Indivior\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis is not the stereotyped, old-fashioned, out-of-date image of an injecting heroin user living on the street \u2013 we are talking about normal people from all levels of society.\u201d More than 34,000 people died in the US in 2016 after overdosing on synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and tramadol (almost 20,000 deaths), or natural and semi-synthetic painkillers including morphine, codeine and oxycodone (over 14,500 deaths). There were also more than 15,500 heroin and 3,400 methadone deaths, according to provisional government figures. Fentanyl, a painkiller developed as a patch for cancer patients that is nearly 100 times stronger than morphine, has become one of the biggest killers. It is the drug that killed singer Prince; it is easy to make illicitly and cheap to buy on the street. Street heroin is increasingly laced with fentanyl. Shipped over from China, the synthetic opioid\u2019s apt street names are Drop Dead and Murder 8 \u2013 a single pill can kill. In Britain, at least 88 deaths have been linked to fentanyl since last December, up from 58 in 2016 and 34 in 2015. Victims include 18-year-old skateboarder Robert Fraser from Kent, who died last November. His mother, who has joined a near-1,000 strong Facebook group called Fentanyl Victims \u2013 We Remember, said she had never heard of fentanyl until she read the toxicology report. Harry Shapiro, director of UK charity DrugWise, has been calling on the UK government to set up a helpline. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a public health issue hidden in plain sight. It\u2019s got to run into hundreds of thousands of people. There are millions of prescriptions being written. We are swallowing an awful lot of these pills. It\u2019s an issue for primary healthcare professionals [GPs] as much as for treatments down the line.\u201d However, cost could also be an issue. Sublocade will cost $1,580 per monthly dose. The new medication is expected to become a blockbuster; analysts at Jefferies are forecasting peak sales of $1.3bn by 2025. America\u2019s opioid crisis dates back to the 1990s, when healthcare organisations encouraged doctors to treat post-operative pain more aggressively. But then drug companies, led by the Sackler family\u2019s firm Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, embarked on an aggressive push of opioid painkillers for all kinds of chronic pain, enticing doctors with freebies and all-expenses-paid trips. Opioid pills were soon sold in vast quantities through barely regulated treatment centres, which became known as \u201cpill mills\u201d. Many more pharma companies will need to follow Indivior\u2019s example if the industry is to silence its critics. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Bitcoin is the fastest-growing asset in the world this year, but the virtual currency does not appear to have many users in London\u2019s tech district. It has been more than a month since bitcoin was used to buy a flat white or craft beer sold at the Old Shoreditch Station, according to the hospitality manager at the east London bar. Louis Chauvin admits he cannot find the iPad that is used by staff for processing bitcoin payments, as he resumes serving customers queueing to pay with their contactless bank cards. Although the establishment sits in the capital\u2019s buzzing tech hub, and is advertised online as one of the few retailers in London accepting the hipster-cum-computer nerds\u2019 currency, as few as 20 people have asked to pay with it in the two years he has worked there. Over the same period, the value of a single bitcoin has rocketed from around $300 to more than $11,000 this week. On Friday, the currency was trading at $10,700. Chauvin says bitcoin\u2019s increasing value \u2013 and media coverage \u2013 has not escaped customers. More people have come in asking how it works, thinking of using it in their own shop, rather than actually paying with it, he says, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s cool, it attracts some people. But for now it\u2019s niche.\u201d Bitcoin is a digital currency, also known as a cryptocurrency, that emerged after the financial crisis and is not underpinned by a central bank. It allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods for goods and services \u2013 an idea that has evidently caught the imagination of some investors, because its price has surged by more than 900% in 2017. Bitcoin \u2013 created by \u201cminers\u201d who use high-powered computers to solve complex mathematical problems \u2013 must be stored online using a digital wallet, and can be bought or sold using exchanges such as Bitstamp, Bithumb and Kraken. But as bitcoin hits the stratosphere, there are fears an economic bubble is forming as it becomes treated less like a currency and more like a store of value, open for speculators making ever increasing bets on how far it can rise. Central bankers, who had to step in when the subprime mortgage bubble burst, have also warned of its dangers. Economists have compared bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise with past bubbles, such as the tulip mania of the 17th century and the dotcom bubble that began in the late 90s with the Nasdaq index in New York and burst in 2000. Both examples foreshadow a painful collapse for a currency that has no intrinsic value to those who hold it beyond that ascribed to it by a community of owners. Should they realise the emperor has no clothes en masse, there could be a rude awakening. Oliver White at Fathom Financial Consulting wrote that bitcoin \u201ccertainly fits the criterion\u201d for a bubble asset. Using data stretching back to 2013, Fathom\u2019s economists compared the price of bitcoin with its historical average and plotted that against other mainstream assets - such as shares and bonds. They found the current value of bitcoin running at six times its average price since 2013. The cryptocurrency has yo-yoed with extreme volatility over the period \u2013 over the past week, the price has leapt to as high as $11,379 and plunged to $9,146 before rebounding to $10,700. Bitcoin disciples argue its price will rise further, viewing volatility as a necessary bump on the path to even higher valuations. Fans even coined a term to describe their tactic of holding on for dear life \u2013 Hodl. A deliberate mistyped neologism - up there with noob, to mean newbie \u2013 adding to the pantheon of computer slang. There are some rational reasons to keep calm and carrying on hodling. Serious investors are just getting interested in a market that has so far been dominated by crypto nerds and retail investors. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is introducing bitcoin derivatives \u2013 a form of bet on the future value of the currency \u2013 which will let hedge funds into the market before Christmas. Commentators also point out that tech stocks in the dotcom crash were worth $2.9tn before collapsing in 2000, whereas the market cap of bitcoin currently stands at $170bn, which could signal there is more room for the bubble to grow. The libertarian dream of bitcoin\u2019s creators is of a currency existing outside the traditional world of finance. But the bigger bitcoin grows and the more conventional institutions such as the CME get involved, the more chance there is of investors losing money and for regulators to intervene. Global financial leaders such as JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs\u2019s Lloyd Blankfein have warned that the currency is ripe for use by fraudsters. Ajit Tripathi of accountancy firm PwC says bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise and its creation myth have attracted more buyers. The currency is said to have been created by a mysterious figure called Satoshi Nakamoto, although there is no proof this is actually a real person. The absence of any government or bank standing behind the currency also fuels its appeal to those unhappy with the financial system after the credit crunch. \u201cBubbles are driven by sentiment and stories, and bitcoin has a great story with a lot of mystery and spectacle to it,\u201d Tripathi says. \u201cIs bitcoin at $40,000 by the middle of next year unthinkable? It\u2019s not \u2013 but is there a logical and rational explanation for why it should be, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Back in east London at the Old Street roundabout, known as \u201cSilicon Roundabout\u201d for its proximity to so many tech startups, Ben Page-Phillips says he fears a collapse in bitcoin\u2019s value.

Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption \u2013&nbsp;or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Louis Chauvin admits he cannot find the iPad that is used by staff for processing bitcoin payments, as he resumes serving customers queueing to pay with their contactless bank cards.

On Friday, the currency was trading at $10,700. </p> \n<p>Chauvin says bitcoin\u2019s increasing value \u2013 and media coverage \u2013 has not escaped customers. More people have come in asking how it works, thinking of using it in their own shop, rather than actually paying with it, he says, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s cool, it attracts some people.

Central bankers, who had to step in when the subprime mortgage bubble burst, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/29/bitcoin-world-economy-bank-of-england-jon-cunliffe-price\">have also warned of its dangers</a>.</p> \n<p>Economists have compared bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise with past bubbles, <a data-gu-preview=\"true\" href=\"https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/5a21525aa1bc53061d927335\">such as the tulip mania of the 17th century </a>and the dotcom bubble that began in the late 90s with the Nasdaq index in New York and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/dec/30/internetnews.business\">burst in 2000</a>. Both examples foreshadow a painful collapse for a currency that has no intrinsic value to those who hold it beyond that ascribed to it by a community of owners. Should they realise the emperor has no clothes en masse, there could be a rude awakening. </p> \n<p>Oliver White at Fathom Financial Consulting wrote that bitcoin \u201ccertainly fits the criterion\u201d for a bubble asset. Using data stretching back to 2013, Fathom\u2019s economists compared the price of bitcoin with its historical average and plotted that against other mainstream assets - such as shares and bonds. They found the current value of bitcoin running at six times its average price since 2013. The cryptocurrency has yo-yoed with extreme volatility over the period \u2013 over the past week, the price has leapt to as high as $11,379 and plunged to $9,146 before rebounding to $10,700.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/02/bitcoin-bubble-the-warnings-from-history\">Bitcoin bubble?

The libertarian dream of bitcoin\u2019s creators is of a currency existing outside the traditional world of finance.

Speculators bought and sold bulbs, pushing up prices, while more people rushed in to the market after hearing about all the money being made. Prices skyrocketed to unsustainable levels, before crashing spectacularly as demand dried up. South Sea bubble Sir Isaac Newton was among those thought to have lost heavily from investing in the South Sea Company, which had the monopoly rights for trade between Britain and South America in the early 18th century. Investors bought shares on the expectation of profits, but prices rose far beyond the gains on offer. Britain was at war with Spain for control of South America, and little profit was made, prompting the shares to collapse. Dotcom bubble The arrival of scores of new internet companies to the stock market, including the New York-based Nasdaq exchange, created a buzz in the late 1990s that led to excessive speculation. Many new firms were able to win huge valuations as public companies, even though they generated very little or no profit whatsoever. Selling at the top of the market in early 2000 triggered panic, while the sources of funding for companies with little profit-making ability dried up, further exacerbating their decline and the market crash. Subprime mortgage crisis Banks irresponsibly lent to US households who couldn\u2019t really afford the mortgages they were being sold, egged on by the massive returns to be made by packaging the loans into bonds by their investment banking arms. When the number of households fallings into arrears on their mortgages began to rise, investors began to realise the scale of the bad assets pumped into financial markets, triggering the collapse of the banking system in 2008.",
