      "bodyText": "It's a happy holiday for the financial world. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has turned down the throttle on quantitative easing and calm has prevailed. As the Fed said, monthly purchases of assets will be reduced from $85bn to $75bn (\u00a346bn), stock markets rose and bond markets helpfully went sideways. The baby-steps nature of the Fed's action was one reason. Another was the assurance that interest rates will stay at next to nothing for ages \u2013 or \"well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6.5%\". It's a long way from the terrors of the summer, when markets worried that even a modest reduction in the dosage of printed money would cause the recovery to falter. A lot of jobs have been added since then, and the US economic data is strong. So confidence in a self-sustaining recovery is more robust than in the weeks when a shutdown in Washington was leading the financial news. All the same, the route to the exit from quantitative easing looks hellishly tricky. The undertaking itself can be deemed a success in the sense that a great global depression may have been averted. And, if the recovery continues to be strong, there's no problem. Janet Yellen, Bernanke's successor, would be able to accelerate the tapering of quantitative easing and be applauded. But what if \u2013 next May, say \u2013 the Fed's monthly habit is down to $45bn, but the employment numbers are softening, growth in the US is weakening and the housing market is faltering? What would be the correct response? In theory, it might be time to hit the accelerator again, perhaps returning to $65bn-a-month. But an about-turn \u2013 halfway through a taper programme \u2013 would send an incredibly weak message. The Fed would stand accused of misjudging the underlying strength of the recovery. Sceptics of quantitative easing would have a field-day, arguing that another increase in an ineffective medicine would be the very worst prescription. Credibility, then, rests on the single premise that the US recovery will continue to be strong and allow a full, gradual and uninterrupted reduction in the asset-buying programme. Life may indeed turn out so sweetly. But a weak patch for the US economy \u2013 not the consensus view, but obviously a possibility \u2013 would test faith in central bankers' magic. The UK form of quantitative easing involved fixed amounts and an imprecise deadline: when the quota was filled, no more gilts were bought until the Bank's monetary policy committee gave a new mandate. The UK design looks superior to the US version, which uses a rolling monthly programme, thereby creating the illusion that this experimental monetary machine is a finely calibrated instrument. In truth, it's nothing of the sort, and that fact may cause trouble on the way out. Nobody can really know whether $5bn, $10bn, or $20bn, is the right pace of reduction for the US; or, indeed, whether an immediate halt would produce very different results. Nevertheless, markets will obsess over every tweak of the dial. Yellen is up against it. Last-minute promotional games December 21: time to start the Christmas shopping. It's only now that retailers display their real prices, as opposed to those they offer suckers who think Christmas starts in mid-November with the blitz of sugary TV adverts. Once again, half the retail industry is surprised that many shoppers are waiting for \"sale\" stickers to appear before buying. What did they expect? If they play the \"last-minute bargains\" card year after year, the punters will adapt. Marks &amp; Spencer is where the City analysts have turned their spotlight. The group has been running promotions with increasing intensity all week, heightening the worry that M&amp;S is on course for another seasonal shocker. Surprisingly, perhaps, there's sympathy for the chief executive, Marc Bolland. The mild winter hasn't helped clothing retailers; the new, revamped, clothing ranges were never likely to provide instant salvation; and M&amp;S, even in Sir Stuart Rose's day, played last-minute promotional games. Come on, though, part of the skill in retailing is matching supply and demand. The only certainty about pre-Christmas sales is that customers who paid full-price in recent weeks will be irritated. On M&amp;S's latest promotion, analyst Nick Bubb says: \"Whether it will turn out to be worth doing in the short-term, just to try to save the CEO's job, remains to be seen, but the M&amp;S brand will suffer long-term damage.\" Fair comment. To be fair, M&amp;S shareholders should reserve judgment on Christmas trading until the hard profit numbers are in. But, if it's bad news, investors should not accept slippery excuses. Arch-rival Next (now worth \u00a31bn more than M&amp;S in stock market value) seems to be able, consistently, to start its sales on Boxing Day without suffering problems with excess stock. Why can't M&amp;S? Hunting for a deal Complicated name, complicated incentive arrangements. Well, what did you expect from Bob Diamond, boss of Barclays until the last governor of the Bank of England ensured he wasn't? Atlas Mara Co-Nvest, an adventure into banking in Africa (probably, but nothing is guaranteed), raised $325m this week and can now start hunting for a deal. The founders, led by Diamond, are putting up $20m for a slice of the cake but, naturally, they hope their portion will yield extra cherries. Here's the formula: after a deal, holders of \"founder preferred shares\" will collect 20% of the increase in Atlas Mara Co-Nvest's value provided the gain is at least 15%. This 20% cut will continue to be paid, in shares, every year for seven years so long as the company's value passes the previous year's peak. The 20% structure is no more greedy than those demanded by top-end hedge fund managers and private equity principals. And, yes, there's an alignment of interest of sorts. Even so, it's remarkable that Diamond can command such a price. It's not as if Barclays Capital, the investment bank he built, has created much long-term sustainable value for Barclays. A time for calm? Aberdeen Asset Management is in the middle of a big deal: the \u00a3550m purchase from Lloyds Banking Group of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership. A moment, you might think, for directors to calm investors by refraining from selling shares. Not a bit of it. Andrew Laing, deputy chief executive, cashed in \u00a35.3m this week. Chief executive Martin Gilbert sold shares worth \u00a38.6m at the start of the month. Hugh Young, star fund manager in Singapore, banked \u00a35.5m at the same time. The disposals all flowed from the multi-year bonus and incentive schemes. And sales in December, we are told, are a regular practice at Aberdeen, a company that rewards its board with shares. All the same, a display of directors' greed for the long-term prize would have gone down better.",

Presenting the bill before it unleashed raucous debate, the development minister Kostis Hadzidakis reminded lawmakers that Greece was still in \u201ca state of emergency.\u201d \u201cIt is in the public interest that it is passed through the House as an emergency piece of legislation because the ban expires on December 31st,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As it is, the government has drawn up legislation that has not been met with the approval of the either EU, ECB or IMF. With non-performing loans posing an ever bigger risk to financial stability \u2013 this week the Bank of Greece announced that non-performing loans had risen to 29.3% in June from 24.5% a year ago \u2013 creditors say the ability of banks to reclaim losses by auctioning off homes is crucial to the liquidity of Greece\u2019s cash-starved market.</p> <p>After weeks of wrangling, the development ministry has drawn up draft legislation that foresees the freeze being extended through the new year but only for households with an annual net income of under \u20ac35,000&#xa0;in primary properties with a market value of no more than \u20ac200,000.</p> <p>Although the legislation is likely to be passed when it is put to vote in an extraordinary session tomorrow (parliament was meant to close for the holiday break today) opponents on both the left and right have vowed to keep up the pressure. The radical left main opposition leader, Alexis Tsipas, has described it as a \u201cbarbaric last act in the brutal internal deflation\u201d that Greece is being subjected to. Campaigners who have been feverishly gathering signatures against the lifting of the ban \u2013 passed by an earlier socialist government in a bid to protect the vulnerable \u2013 say up to 130,000 Greek families face homelessness if foreclosures are allowed to take place.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-183c3415-2497-4d5d-8e16-fe2e9fee0585\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/20/1387556577137/38f5c68b-1bac-4a96-adf1-82afc253c3c4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek farmers protested in front of parliament as lawmakers inside debated a draft bill that taxes farming land.

Like the Committee, my assessment has brightened in recent months. But, by the same token, I do not yet have sufficient confidence in this outlook to risk the removal of any monetary accommodation at this time.</p> <p>My hope and my forecast is that we will continue to accumulate evidence indicating a strengthening economy in coming months.

After all, the Fed\u2019s announcement that it will start to taper its monthly asset purchases has removed some uncertainty and the sanguine response so far may discourage bears from clinging to their short positions.</p> <p>However, we do not put a lot of store by such seasonal factors and would focus instead on the fundamental drivers.

The Netherlands was also stripped of its AAA status by Standard &amp; Poors recently. Now, two economists reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that Germany faces the same risk.</p> <p data-line-id=\"2826e7c9944c49259df41f5b0495ae7e\"><strong>Edin Mujagic</strong> and <strong>Sylvester Eijffinger</strong> at&#xa0;<strong>Tilburg University</strong> in the Netherlands, point out that Germany's public debt is higher than the Netherlands and its fiscal position could weaken considerably.</p> <p data-line-id=\"2826e7c9944c49259df41f5b0495ae7e\">Here is an extract from their <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sylvester-eijffinger-and-edin-mujagic-warn-that-the-recent-downgrade-of-the-netherlands--credit-rating-could-mean-that-germany-will-be-next\">article </a>for <strong>Project Syndicate</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p data-line-id=\"2826e7c9944c49259df41f5b0495ae7e\">Another potentially destabilising factor is the cost of saving the euro, which could skyrocket if the crisis escalates further.

While most Germans support the new government, and other countries have called it a boon for Europe, there is a risk that the two parties\u2019 divergent views on how to fix the eurozone could cause friction. For example, the Social Democrats support the implementation of Eurobonds, which the Christian Democrats vehemently oppose.</p> <p data-line-id=\"a0425d8a493a476eb6dfba927bc5b071\">More broadly, the coalition\u2019s main potential benefit \u2013 strong support for the government in parliament \u2013 could backfire, with the parties\u2019 conflicting stances preventing any significant reforms. And the reforms that&#xa0;<em>are</em>&#xa0;undertaken, such as the planned introduction of a minimum wage, could undermine economic performance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, many people, <a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/profile/blueba/public\">including in this blog</a>, have criticised governments for taking credit ratings so seriously.

But the sources of that growth will make him uncomfortable.</p> <p>&#xa0;Three key problems stand out. Firstly, there is a strong contribution from volatile stock-building. Secondly, the fall in the savings ratio from 6.2% to 5.4% shows spending is running ahead of incomes. Finally, the current account deficit widened from \u00a36.2 billion to \u00a320.7 billion between Q2 and Q3, the highest share of GDP since 1989.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52b42c46e4b09f9df01d1860\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-20T12:02:08.438Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On a day when the UK growth figures are under the microscope, an interesting debate has broken out over the value of consumer spending to the recovery.</p> <p>In the blue corner is <strong>Chris Giles</strong>, the <strong>FT's economics editor</strong>, who argues that \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3d4b5196-6739-11e3-a5f9-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2njD1fUFS\">it is deeply patronising\" to assume people are buying more than is good for them, or the wider economy</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The anti-consumption mood might be strong but it is also profoundly wrong. Consumption is the purpose of economic activity and allows us to meet our material aspirations in the pursuit of happiness. It is also deeply patronising for those with reasonably comfortable incomes to fret that the little people are consuming too much for their good or for that of the wider economy.</p> <p>Worse, the economic logic behind concerns about debt-fuelled consumption fails to fit the facts. Sure, Britain\u2019s household liabilities as a proportion of gross domestic product ballooned from 70 per cent in 1998 to 106 per cent in 2007, but that was not a reflection of people borrowing to buy frivolous fashions or fine wine. The share of consumption in GDP fell over the same period \u2013 so, far from borrowing for spending, younger households took on the debt to buy increasingly expensive houses.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the red corner is <strong>Duncan Weldon</strong>, senior economist at the <strong>TUC</strong>, who thinks that the <a href=\"http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2013/12/the-recovery-what-i-got-wrong-what-ive-learned\">FT underplays the need for re-balancing in the economy</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think he [Chris Giles] is missing a third possibility. Alongside the dichotomy between collective insanity and increased confidence, is it not possible that the cost of borrowing dropped making it more attractive to consumers?</p> <p>I increasingly think if we want to understand what turned the stagnation of late 2010 to mid-2012 into the growing economy of mid-2012 onwards then we should be looking at unconventional monetary policy....What&#xa0;<em>I</em>&#xa0;have learned since mid-2012 is that monetary policy, even at the lower bound (i.e. when rates can\u2019t be cut further), can still be very powerful.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is a great deal more to Weldon's post, including some soul searching on why his forecast for weak GDP growth for 2013 turned out to be wrong. And a smart dismissal of those linking between better news from the eurozone with increased consumer spending -&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&#xa0;This feels, to me anyway, like a bit of a stretch \u2013 \u2018have you heard that Italian bond yields are now well below 7%?

      "bodyText": "Over in Greece it has been a day of intense infighting in the 300-seat parliament with MPs quarrelling over the potentially explosive issue of home repossessions \u2013 a long-standing demand of the debt \u2013ridden country\u2019s creditors. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Just when the prime minister Antonis Samaras is hailing the end of the Greek crisis \u2013 telling fellow EU leaders in Brussels that after \u201csix very painful years of recession 2014 will be the first year of recovery\u201d \u2013 the Greek parliament has resembled a pit bull fight as MPs prepare to vote on the single biggest issue to divide them: the seizure by banks of properties whose struggling owners have been unable to keep up with mortgages. With the blanket ban on repossessions expiring at the end of December, Samaras\u2019 fragile coalition is now in a race against-the-clock to pass new legislation that will not only cut the grade with the country's lenders but also be endorsed by MPs. Presenting the bill before it unleashed raucous debate, the development minister Kostis Hadzidakis reminded lawmakers that Greece was still in \u201ca state of emergency.\u201d \u201cIt is in the public interest that it is passed through the House as an emergency piece of legislation because the ban expires on December 31st,\u201d he said. As it is, the government has drawn up legislation that has not been met with the approval of the either EU, ECB or IMF. With non-performing loans posing an ever bigger risk to financial stability \u2013 this week the Bank of Greece announced that non-performing loans had risen to 29.3% in June from 24.5% a year ago \u2013 creditors say the ability of banks to reclaim losses by auctioning off homes is crucial to the liquidity of Greece\u2019s cash-starved market. After weeks of wrangling, the development ministry has drawn up draft legislation that foresees the freeze being extended through the new year but only for households with an annual net income of under \u20ac35,000 in primary properties with a market value of no more than \u20ac200,000. Although the legislation is likely to be passed when it is put to vote in an extraordinary session tomorrow (parliament was meant to close for the holiday break today) opponents on both the left and right have vowed to keep up the pressure. The radical left main opposition leader, Alexis Tsipas, has described it as a \u201cbarbaric last act in the brutal internal deflation\u201d that Greece is being subjected to. Campaigners who have been feverishly gathering signatures against the lifting of the ban \u2013 passed by an earlier socialist government in a bid to protect the vulnerable \u2013 say up to 130,000 Greek families face homelessness if foreclosures are allowed to take place. And on that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back on Monday as usual. The dissenting voice against the US Federal Reserve's move this week to trim its $85bn a month bond buying programme has been explaining his thinking further. In a statement Eric S. Rosengren said: As the statement issued by the Committee notes, I believe that, \"with the unemployment rate still elevated and the inflation rate well below the target, changes in the purchase program are premature until incoming data more clearly indicate that economic growth is likely to be sustained above its potential rate.\" I agree with the Committee's assessment that the economy has been improving, in part as a result of the Federal Reserve's asset purchase program. I, too, expect the economy to continue to improve, and my forecast is for real GDP to grow at a rate close to 3% next year. Like the Committee, my assessment has brightened in recent months. But, by the same token, I do not yet have sufficient confidence in this outlook to risk the removal of any monetary accommodation at this time. My hope and my forecast is that we will continue to accumulate evidence indicating a strengthening economy in coming months. Thus, my decision to cast a dissenting vote was focused on counseling patience in removing monetary accommodation. His full statement is here: Eric S. Rosengren Commenting on Dissenting Vote at the Meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee Capital Economics has looked ahead to the next few days in the markets: Equities often tend to do quite well in the final few trading sessions of the year as investors engage in short-covering to square their books. What\u2019s more, the moves are often exaggerated by a lack of liquidity. We would be surprised if this year were any different. After all, the Fed\u2019s announcement that it will start to taper its monthly asset purchases has removed some uncertainty and the sanguine response so far may discourage bears from clinging to their short positions. However, we do not put a lot of store by such seasonal factors and would focus instead on the fundamental drivers. The big picture as we head into 2014 is that the Fed\u2019s monetary policy stance is set to remain highly accommodative even as it begins to taper. This should provide ongoing support for equity and bond markets in particular. Meanwhile Janet Yellen took another step to becoming Ben Bernanke's successor as chair of the US Federal Reserve. She cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, which voted by 59 to 34 to end debate on her nomination. A vote to confirm her is due on 6 January, and she would take over when Bernanke's term expires on 31 January. European stock markets have ended the week on a positive note, shaking off the US Federal Reserve's decision to begin tapering, as well as the S&amp;P downgrade of the European Union from AAA to AA+. The final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 21.88 points or 0.33% higher at 6606.58 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.69% to 9400.18 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.4% higher at4193.77 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.6% better at 18,565.61 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 0.26% to 9689.9 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.52% higher. Better news for eurozone, with consumer confidence improving more than expected in December. European Commission data showed confidence rose from -15.4 in November to -13.6, still negative but at a 29 month high and better than forecasts of a -15 level. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: Hopefully, the renewed and appreciable strengthening in consumer confidence in December and the help to purchasing power coming from muted inflation across the Eurozone (just 0.9% in November) will increasingly underpin consumer spending and help Eurozone economic recovery to gradually gain traction over the coming months following disappointing GDP growth of just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. Nevertheless, the suspicion is that consumers will likely remain pretty cautious in their spending in the near term at least so that any improvement in consumer spending will likely be gradual. Consumer confidence across the Eurozone is still pretty mixed, while the economic fundamentals remain challenging for consumers in most countries. A quick reminder of our bumper Christmas quiz -packed with curious questions and just the thing for the last Friday before Christmas. Now I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Thank you for following and all your comments so far... It's the season for credit rating reports: the UK has hung onto its AAA rating, but the EU has been downgraded. The Netherlands was also stripped of its AAA status by Standard &amp; Poors recently. Now, two economists reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that Germany faces the same risk. Edin Mujagic and Sylvester Eijffinger at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, point out that Germany's public debt is higher than the Netherlands and its fiscal position could weaken considerably. Here is an extract from their article for Project Syndicate: Another potentially destabilising factor is the cost of saving the euro, which could skyrocket if the crisis escalates further. Given that Germany and the Netherlands have provided large guarantees, they risk a substantial increase in public debt. Moreover, German politics is entering a new phase, with a grand coalition of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats set to rule the country for the next four years. While most Germans support the new government, and other countries have called it a boon for Europe, there is a risk that the two parties\u2019 divergent views on how to fix the eurozone could cause friction. For example, the Social Democrats support the implementation of Eurobonds, which the Christian Democrats vehemently oppose. More broadly, the coalition\u2019s main potential benefit \u2013 strong support for the government in parliament \u2013 could backfire, with the parties\u2019 conflicting stances preventing any significant reforms. And the reforms that are undertaken, such as the planned introduction of a minimum wage, could undermine economic performance. Of course, many people, including in this blog, have criticised governments for taking credit ratings so seriously. After all, the ratings agencies hardly covered themselves in glory before or during the financial crisis. News to make a Marmite lover choke on their toast. The pungent yeasty spread is no longer Britain's best-selling breakfast topping. In another shocker, Tetley tea sales are down too. Read the full story here. The came, they saw, they issued a pre-cooked 25-page communiqu\u00e9: the EU leaders' summit in Brussels is over. Although foreign affairs - Ukraine, defence - dominated the discussions, there was just enough time to roll out the red carpet for the banking union, the EU's big plan to manage failing banks with minimal pain for the taxpayer. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: Now the European taxpayer, the French taxpayer won't have to pay anything if there were another financial crisis. From the Council conclusions The European Council welcomes the final agreement reached by the legislators on the Deposit Guarantee Scheme directive and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive [i.e. the Banking Union]... The European Council calls on the legislators to adopt the SRM [Single Resolution Mechanism] before the end of the current legislative period [i.e. spring 2014, before European elections in May]. The single resolution authority would be responsible for winding up failing banks. But hang on a second... The president of the European Parliament said yesterday that European lawmakers would not accept the SRM. So what happens now? Observers already think key elements of the banking union are missing. From Reuters' Brussels team: A government struggling to pay for a failing bank will have to ask for an ESM-paid-for bailout, a humiliating step with strict conditions attached. That deals a blow to a central tenet of banking union as it was originally conceived, namely that weak governments should not be left to cope with banks whose problems can buckle a country. Here is some of the snap reaction &amp; analysis to those better-than-expected US GDP figures. The US economy grew at its fastest pace for almost two years from July to September, according to newly-revised data. The world's largest economy expanded at 4.1% in Q3, up from the Commerce department's previous estimate of 3.6%. The economy is being propelled forward by inventory re-stocking and state and local government spending, according to the department - full release here. The positive news has sent the dollar to a five-yr high against the yen, while stock futures are up too. 14.00 update ... the details behind the headline number: Personal consumption was up 2% in Q3, compared to 1.8% in Q2 Durable goods +7.9% Q3, v. +6.2% Q2 Non durable goods +2.9% v. 1.6% Q2 Services +0.7% v. 1.2% Q2 Time to catch up with Portugal, following dramatic events last night when the Constitutional Court rejected a government plan to cut public sector pensions, one of the measures proposed to help Portugal withdraw from its \u20ac78bn bailout by 2014. The court ruling said the proposal was \"unconstitutional\" because pensioners' savings could not be taken from them. From Reuters The cut in pensions would have saved the government around \u20ac380m. While that number is not large, another set of measures to cut public sector workers' salaries could also be challenged in the same court. The government has so far said it has not prepared alternative fiscal measures for any possible rejections by the court. However, local media have said the government could consider further tax increases as an alternative. Before the ruling, the government said it was on target to leave the bailout programme in 2014, but a senior official at the International Monetary Fund said it could take much longer to address the problems of the Portuguese economy. Subir Lall, head of the IMF mission to Portugal, told the FT (\u00a3) it would take at least a decade to sort out deep-rooted problems that had accumulated over decades. The transformations that the economy needs will have to go on for another 10 to 15 years and they will have to be home grown. The British public expect a slight easing of inflation over the next year. Retail prices are expected to rise by 2.6% in the year ahead, compared to the 2.7% consensus view in November, according to a survey from YouGov. It seems inflation expectations are now falling back, after hitting a two-year high of 3.2% in October, attributed to announcements of big increases in energy bills that month. France is world champion of pessimism: 90% of French people expect the next generation will be worse off than their parents, according to data from the World Economic Forum, which has been turned into this smart video by Les Echos. Other developing countries are also pessimistic, with around three quarters of citizens in the US and other European countries also gloomy about the future, but France takes the biscuit. Les Echos comes up with three reasons: lack of confidence about the future, the difficulties in passing any political reforms to improve France's economic situation, and the slow down in productivity. More background reading (in French). Here is a different take on French pessimism from the Observer in March. More GDP reaction, now from the Institute of Directors. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the IoD, thinks that the UK has the wrong sort of growth, with spending running ahead of incomes. As the Chancellor looks at the latest GDP figures he\u2019s likely to reach for a glass of wine and indigestion tablets at the same time. (jr - perhaps don't try this at home) The strength of GDP, with faster year-on-year growth, will be a cause for celebration. But the sources of that growth will make him uncomfortable. Three key problems stand out. Firstly, there is a strong contribution from volatile stock-building. Secondly, the fall in the savings ratio from 6.2% to 5.4% shows spending is running ahead of incomes. Finally, the current account deficit widened from \u00a36.2 billion to \u00a320.7 billion between Q2 and Q3, the highest share of GDP since 1989. On a day when the UK growth figures are under the microscope, an interesting debate has broken out over the value of consumer spending to the recovery. In the blue corner is Chris Giles, the FT's economics editor, who argues that \"it is deeply patronising\" to assume people are buying more than is good for them, or the wider economy. The anti-consumption mood might be strong but it is also profoundly wrong. Consumption is the purpose of economic activity and allows us to meet our material aspirations in the pursuit of happiness. It is also deeply patronising for those with reasonably comfortable incomes to fret that the little people are consuming too much for their good or for that of the wider economy. Worse, the economic logic behind concerns about debt-fuelled consumption fails to fit the facts. Sure, Britain\u2019s household liabilities as a proportion of gross domestic product ballooned from 70 per cent in 1998 to 106 per cent in 2007, but that was not a reflection of people borrowing to buy frivolous fashions or fine wine. The share of consumption in GDP fell over the same period \u2013 so, far from borrowing for spending, younger households took on the debt to buy increasingly expensive houses. In the red corner is Duncan Weldon, senior economist at the TUC, who thinks that the FT underplays the need for re-balancing in the economy. I think he [Chris Giles] is missing a third possibility. Alongside the dichotomy between collective insanity and increased confidence, is it not possible that the cost of borrowing dropped making it more attractive to consumers? I increasingly think if we want to understand what turned the stagnation of late 2010 to mid-2012 into the growing economy of mid-2012 onwards then we should be looking at unconventional monetary policy....What I have learned since mid-2012 is that monetary policy, even at the lower bound (i.e. when rates can\u2019t be cut further), can still be very powerful. There is a great deal more to Weldon's post, including some soul searching on why his forecast for weak GDP growth for 2013 turned out to be wrong. And a smart dismissal of those linking between better news from the eurozone with increased consumer spending - This feels, to me anyway, like a bit of a stretch \u2013 \u2018have you heard that Italian bond yields are now well below 7%? I think I\u2019ll go and buy a new dishwasher\u2019. Both pieces are well worth reading. Did someone say living standards? More GDP charts &amp; analysis, courtesy of the TUC's Duncan Weldon. Bleak news for staff at a Yorkshire company that puts up Christmas decorations in shopping centres. Sky News is reporting that Fuzzwire have called in the administrators, costing all 190 staff their jobs. The company had put up festive decorations at Newcastle's Metro Centre and Lakeside in Essex. According to a union leader quoted in the Bradford Telegraph and Argus, staff might not be paid over Christmas. One employee told the paper the closure was \"a bitter pill to swallow\". This has been badly handled. We knew it could happen if an investor wasn\u2019t found. Now I\u2019m unemployed with a young family. Everyone is very upset. And here is the UK GDP story in a chart. A chart showing how the UK's trade deficit worsened, to equate to a 5.1% share of GDP, the worst result since 1989. More grumbling in Brussels about the S&amp;P downgrade, with scathing talk of 'Poor and Standards' from EU officials, according to the Economist's Brussels correspondent Anton La Guardia. His blog post also contains helpful background on why the decision could matter Irritated senior EU officials are muttering scathingly about the many failures of \u201cPoor &amp; Standards\u201d since the start of the crisis, from giving Lehman Brothers an A-rating a month before its collapse to underestimating the euro zone\u2019s commitment to hang together through the worst of the crisis in 2011 and 2012 (there was no Greek exit). The decision matters to the extent that it might increase the interest rate that Ireland and Portugal must pay for part of their bailout loans financed by the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), a smallish pot of money guaranteed by the EU budget. This was set up at the same time as the bigger and better known European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). More here. The European Commission has dismissed the downgrade to its credit rating from the Standard &amp; Poors rating agency. Here is the statement from Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. The Commission disagrees with S&amp;P that member states' obligations to the budget in a stress scenario are questionable. All member states have always, and also throughout the financial crisis, provided their expected contributions to the budget in full and in time. More reaction to the ONS data. Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics sees few signs that the economy is rebalancing. The national accounts for the third quarter provide a few reasons to doubt that the UK\u2019s economic recovery will be able to maintain its current strong pace for much longer. While the second estimate of quarterly GDP growth of 0.8% in the third quarter was unrevised, the sources of that growth continue to cause some alarm. Since real incomes grew by just 0.4% q/q, we now know that households fuelled the 0.8% rise in spending partly by saving less. Lower saving can only support growth in spending for so long. Meanwhile, the current account deficit widened from \u00a36.2bn in Q2 to \u00a320.7bn in Q3, the largest share of GDP since 1989. So for now, the economy\u2019s growth spurt seems to be exacerbating existing imbalances in the economy, rather than helping them to heal. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the positive news reinforces the view that the Bank of England will start raising interest rates sooner rather than later. While third-quarter GDP growth was unrevised at 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, it is encouraging that positive upward revisions to growth earlier in the year and in 2012 mean that year-on-year growth was 1.9% rather than 1.5% as previously reported. The domestic growth mix now looks a bit more balanced with business investment revised up. Even so, it must be acknowledged that the pick-up in business investment was from a low level following contraction in three of the previous four quarters However, the trade performance remains extremely disappointing with exports falling even more in the third quarter than first reported. This is also reflected in the dire current account data for the third quarter. Now the reaction from the Treasury: Today\u2019s data show that the recovery has been stronger than previously thought and that the government\u2019s long term economic plan is working. But risks remain and the job is not done, so the government will go on taking the difficult decisions needed to deliver a responsible recovery for all. And here is some of the reaction on Twitter to that slew of ONS data... The Office for National Statistics have released a barrage of economic data this morning: The top headlines: UK GDP was left unchanged at 0.8 for Q3, but revised upwards to 0.8% for Q2 (from 0.7%). the UK's current account deficit widened to \u00a320.7bn, up from \u00a36.2bn in the second quarter, equivalent to 5.1% of GDP, its biggest share of national output since 1989. Household spending grew by 0.8%, or \u00a31.9m, from July to September. Public sector net borrowing , excluding bank bailouts and the transfer of the Royal Mail pension plan, fell to \u00a384.0 billion - \u00a32.0 billion lower than the same period in 2012/13, when it was \u00a385.9 billion. So much for rebalancing the economy and 'the march of the makers... Read the full Office for National Statistics GDP release here and see the rest of their data here And, wait for it, the UK economy grew by 0.8% from July-September, the ONS have said, confirming their previous estimate. But growth in GDP volume over the year has been revised up to 1.9%, from 1.5%*. *Corrected from previous entry that described this as a 2013 forecast. A contrasting story in Germany, where consumer confidence is on the up. German consumers have been shopping in force and the tills will carry on ringing into the new year, according to GfK's survey. Its consumer confidence index is expected to hit 7.6 points in January, up from 7.4 points this month - a six-year high. This from GfK's survey: Consumers believe that the German economy is increasingly gaining pace. At the moment, the economy is mainly driven by domestic economy and according to the experts, this will remain the case in the coming year. The emerging stabilisation of economies in a series of eurozone countries is also likely to boost export prospects again and stimulate the willingness of companies to invest. Just when everyone thought the UK economy was in full-on recovery mode, a survey reveals declining consumer confidence, underscoring the fragile nature of recent growth. British consumer confidence fell for the third straight month in December, despite the recent pick-up in economic activity. Consumer confidence was -13 in December, compared to -12 in November, according to a consumer confidence index compiled by researchers at GfK. Nick Moon, managing director of social research at GfK, said: Although a single point move is not statistically significant, what matters is that the index has fallen for three months in a row, and we can say there is a downwards trend. It is not nearly enough to negate the massive gains made from April to September, and at -13 the Index is still 14 points higher than in the first quarter. With no media coverage of bad economic news \u2013 and indeed continuing coverage of good news \u2013 the explanation for the last quarter of declining confidence most likely results from people\u2019s sense of how well or rather badly - off they personally feel. The positive momentum that followed the Fed's taper decision seems to be ebbing on European markets. FTSE100 +0.12% at 6,592 points France's CAC40 -0.23% at 4,167 points Germany's DAX +0.26% at 9,360 points Spain's IBEX +0.2% at 9,681 points ....and from the FT in Brussels: A bit more on S&amp;P's decision to cut the EU's credit rating. The agency said it had cut the top-notch credit rating down to AA+ because EU budget negotiations have become more contentious. From the S&amp;P statement: In our opinion, the overall creditworthiness of the now 28 European Union (EU) member states has declined. We believe the financial profile of the EU has deteriorated and that cohesion among EU members has lessened. EU budgetary negotiations have become more contentious, signalling what we consider to be rising risks to the support of the EU from some member states. The euro fell 0.2% against the dollar at $1.3636. But not everyone is convinced it is a big deal economically... Shares in the UK's biggest defence company BAE Systems are down 3.8% this morning, after a \u00a36bn deal to supply fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates collapsed. The news is a particular blow to prime minister David Cameron, who made two separate trips in a bid to persuade the Emiratis to sign on the dotted line. BAE announced the news in a statement last night: BAE Systems and the UK Government have been in discussions with the Government of the United Arab Emirates regarding a range of defence and security capabilities including the potential supply of Typhoon aircraft. The UAE have advised that they have elected not to proceed with these proposals at this time. As my colleague Sean Farrell reports, it is \"a serious setback for BAE as it seeks to reduce its reliance on US and British defence markets that have been hit by government spending cuts\". The news is a blow not only to BAE but also to the prime minister, who intervened personally last month to try to secure a deal that would have represented a significant boost for British exports. During a visit to the UAE, Cameron urged Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, to opt for the Typhoon over a rival fighter produced by France's Dassault Systemes. Analysts thought the prime minister's move could have swung the deal for BAE, raising hopes that the UK will meet George Osborne's target of doubling exports to \u00a31tn by 2020. Read his full story here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Chancellor George Osborne was given an early Christmas present from the Standard &amp; Poor's ratings agency this morning: the UK\u2019s AAA credit rating will stay - for now. The agency had been threatening to downgrade the UK, but now its AAA crown is secure. It wasn\u2019t all mistletoe and wine though - S&amp;P warned that the outlook remains negative. The economy is recovering, albeit largely on the back of private consumption and residential investment. The outlook remains negative, reflecting our view of the risks to the sustainability of growth. The news was less good for the European Union, which lost its top notch credit rating from S&amp;P. The agency downgraded the EU to AA+ from AAA reflecting \u201cthe overall weaker creditworthiness of the EU\u2019s 28 member states\u201d. Apart from that, investors continue to chew on the Fed\u2019s decision to start unwinding its stimulus programme. Asian stock markets have had a mixed day. Hong Kong\u2019s share index has fallen on concerns about lack of liquidity in China\u2019s banking system, but Japan\u2019s Nikkei surged to a six-year high as the Bank of Japan left its stimulus measures in place. Plenty more is afoot. EU leaders are finishing up their summit in Brussels. Plus we have consumer confidence data for the UK and the eurozone, and the Office for National Statistics second take on GDP for Q3. That figure could be revised upwards to 0.9% after a sharp upswing in the construction industry. I'll be tracking that, with the rest of the economy and business news today. Stay tuned \u2026",

Germany's biggest bank also said it was working to resolve the raft of other legal and regulatory problems. \"Today's agreement marks another step in our efforts to resolve the bank's legacy issues, and we intend to make further progress in this regard throughout 2014,\" co-chief executives Juergen Fitschen and Anshu Jain said. Deutsche Bank said the payment had already been taken into account in its existing litigation reserves and that no additional reserves will be taken for the settlement. Earlier this month, the European commission slapped Deutsche Bank with a 725m euro penalty in a probe into the rigging of benchmark inter-bank interest rates. US and UK regulators have yet to fine Deutsche in the case.",

      "bodyText": "And on the seventh week, the market rose. After six weeks of decline, its worst run since June 2008, the FTSE 100 recovered some poise, despite the US Federal Reserve's surprise move to trim its $85bn a month bond buying programme by $10bn. Investors had been nervous in the run up to Wednesday's Fed meeting, worried that Ben Bernanke's last appearance as chairman would coincide with a decision to begin turning off the money taps. In the event that was exactly what happened, although the size of the cutback was small enough not to upset the markets and the pill was sugared with comments that US interest rates would be kept low for some time. Better than expected US GDP figures on Friday also helped sentiment. So despite worries elsewhere, including signs of a possible credit crunch in China and fears of a French recession, the FTSE 100 finished at 6606.58 yesterday, up 21.88 points on the day and more than 166 points on the week. This was the biggest weekly rise since July, with the index is now at its best level since the end of November. Carnival cruised 77p higher to \u00a323.89 after Thursday's better than expected results, prompting UBS, Credit Suisse and Nomura to raise their price targets. UBS said: We have upgraded Carnival to buy from neutral based on higher conviction in the forward outlook. We have raised 2014 earnings per share to $1.87 from $1.71 and 2015 to $2.54 from $2.42, and raised our price target to $41 from $34. The biggest upside [from the company's conference call] was hearing Costa brand, in its first quarter of positive pricing since Concordia in January 2012, saw yields increase double-digits. Aside from benefit to yields from having 15% of fleet recovering yield at a double digit rate in the fourth quarter, more important is the idea that if Costa can recover to that degree, then Carnival should also be able to recover from Carnival brand's image issues from a far less serious issue. But mining shares were mixed after the Fed decision, with precious metal prices hit particularly hard. So Randgold Resources lost another 46p to \u00a337.65 yesterday, while Mexican silver miner Fresnillo fell 1p to 697p. BAE Systems dropped 19.9p to 422.1p after Thursday's news that the United Arab Emirates had pulled out of talks to buy the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft. BG lost 10p to 1247.5p as it declared the Carioca field in the Santos basin in Brazil was viable, but with lower than expected oil volumes. Investec said: There is a small wrinkle in the separate press releases \u2013 [operator] Petrobras states that recoverable oil volume from Carioca is 459m barrels. BG does not repeat this number but states that Petrobras's figure is based in the initial stage of development and that is sees upside from further drilling. It was clear that Carioca was likely to be smaller than initial expectations a couple of years ago (up to 1.7bn barrels) but the Petrobras figure is likely to be below market expectations. Marks &amp; Spencer recovered 0.8p to 445p following recent worries about discounting hitting its margins and despite news of a 30% off sale on Saturday. But Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald kept his sell rating: We are downgrading our 2014 pre-tax profit forecast from \u00a3645m to \u00a3630m, taking earnings per share down from 31.5p to 30.8p and making similar revisions to our subsequent year forecasts. We are retaining our sell recommendation but downgrading our target price from 445p to 425p reflecting the downgrade to forecasts. We continue to believe it will take a number of seasons before there is a marked improvement in performance in womenswear. The strategy still appears to be evolving and not set in stone. Debt levels remain over \u00a32bn restricting the potential for an accelerated dividend payout, and there remain accounting issues relative to peers. In the meantime, the stock has declined by more than 10% in the last quarter. Supermarket shares were hit during the week by news that discounters such as Aldi and Lidl were increasingly gaining market share at their expense. But yesterday they regained some of their losses, with J Sainsbury up 4.1p at 370.1p, Tesco 8.35p better at 332.20p and Morrisons 1.9p higher at 261.3p. (The fourth is Wal-Mart owned Asda). Dixons Retail suffered from a spate of profit taking, slipping 0.48p to 48.40p after a positive update and hopes of a bumper Christmas for tablet sales. Chip maker Arm, whose designs are in iPads and smartphones, also benefited, adding 12p to \u00a310.68. The company also pleased investors with a positive conference call where it raised its forecasts for future product shipments Among the mid-caps 3i edged up 0.6p to 380.1p after news late on Thursday that chief executive Simon Borrows had spent around \u00a31.8m on buying 500,000 shares in the private equity group. Serco slipped 4.6p to 472p despite the outsourcing group announcing it had won a \u00a3120m extension to its contract with the Ministry of Justice for Thameside prison. Earlier in the week the company agreed to repay the government \u00a368.5m relating to its electronic tagging contract. Both Serco and G4S, steady at 248.9p, are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over the contracts, where they charged for criminals were not monitors, who were already in prison, or were even dead. Finally Severn Trent slipped 30p to \u00a316.61 after Ofwat's review of water companies business plans was said to be negative for the sector by ratings agency Moody's. Severn Trent also bought minority stakes in three PFI companies from joint venture partner Costain, up 0.5p at 282.5p, for \u00a312m.",

      "body": "<p>The deLeuze family of ZD Wines, located in California\u2019s picturesque Napa Valley, has a history of eco-friendly practices that spans three generations. It all started, however, with bugs.</p> <p>The winery\u2019s late founder, Norman deLeuze, undertook organic farming in the early 80s, after an outbreak of \u201cgrape leafhoppers\u201d infested his cabernet sauvignon vineyard.</p> <p>\u201cHe called the farm advisor and asked what to do about it,\u201d recalls deLeuze\u2019s son Brett, who manages the business with his mother, Rosa Lee, and brother, Robert. The prescribed pesticide listed several health warnings \u2013 one of which discouraged entering the vineyard for three days. The potentially harmful effects alarmed Norman, Brett deLeuze says. \u201cHe decided that was the last time he\u2019d ever do that.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest challenge since has been finding alternative pest and weed control for their combined 33-acres of vineyards. Since ploughing weeds by hand is labor intensive and expensive, the winemaking team uses flaming devices to torch seedlings before they sprout. Natural predators \u2013 like bats, owls and ladybugs \u2013 keep pests off plants.</p> <p>The deLeuze experience is one that a lot of small businesses can relate to: sometimes, making your business sustainable is not just a moral choice. It\u2019s a practical one.</p> <p>Yet, becoming sustainable, eco-friendly, and socially responsible is that the kind of thing that a lot of pragmatic business owners find it easy to dismiss as a lot of trendy, hippie jargon. The assumption among businesses for years has been that a quality product is all you need to attract customers. That\u2019s no longer true. Consumers, especially millennials, increasingly want to buy products that are of good quality \u2013 and give back to society.</p> <p>Becoming socially responsible is more work, which means getting entrepreneurs and business owners to embrace it has been a challenge. When cash is tight, it\u2019s easier and cheaper to order a harmful pesticide than it is to wait for bats to kill your bugs. Increasingly, however, it looks like there won\u2019t be a choice. A 2012 Nielsen survey revealed that two-thirds of consumers prefer buying from companies that give back to society and the environment.</p> <p>There is also a penalty for businesses who screw up, so that pesticide might end up being more expensive than it looks at first. Around 90% of consumers would even boycott a company if they learned of irresponsible practices, a report by Cone Communications/Echo Global found. Companies aren\u2019t saving money if they\u2019re losing customers.</p> <p>Still, making the business case \u2013 that being eco-friendly and sustainable can also be profitable \u2013 is the major challenge facing those who want companies to start embracing an ethical agenda as much as a financial one. Being eco-friendly and socially thoughtful is an overhaul of what we know about business: it requires business owners to reconsider everything from suppliers to which products to stock on the shelves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ae4298ad-b864-453f-966a-e9e2312838e0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/20/1387557030037/a51debf7-2d90-407c-914c-67149ac6892d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"zd wines\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ZD Wines. Photograph: /ZD Wines</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seri McClendon, CEO of Clean Agency, assesses how companies work and helps them create plans to become more socially responsible. Once small-business owners learn how to be socially responsible, \u201cit\u2019s hard to go back to business as usual,\u201d she says.</p> <p>When business leaders want to be more socially responsible, there are key steps they can take. The first is to start small.</p> <p>\u201cJust take the low hanging fruit first,\u201d suggests Paul Dolan, a wine-grower whose business centers around sustainable vineyard and the author of True to Our Roots: Fermenting a Business Revolution.</p> <p>Dolan says that starting with simple tasks, like recycling more or volunteering, can eventually lead to greater goals. Each additional challenge leadership takes on, Dolan says, \u201cwill open new&#xa0;insights into what\u2019s next.\u201d</p> <p>For the deLeuzes, they started small \u2013 organic farming, fighting pesticides \u2013 and then increased their efforts to be socially sustainable. The winery\u2019s Rutherford estate, which houses its cellar, tasting room and offices, now runs exclusively on solar power. Two on-site electric car chargers are available for public use; another is located at ZD\u2019s Carneros district property.</p> <p>Additionally, the wine-making team composts grape skins, seeds and stems from each harvest and adds it to the soil. An extensive water recycling system plays a role in the estate\u2019s sustainability, along with recycling everything from office paper to wine bottles.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe in not wasting,\u201d says Brett deLeuze. It\u2019s a custom that stems from his father\u2019s parents and continues through the latest generation of proprietors and employees. \u201cWe try to stay aware and are constantly trying to do even better.\u201d</p> <p>Sustainability goes beyond what happens in a company\u2019s own headquarters. Many small businesses in the past knew it was smart to help the community \u2013 a commitment that drove Lions\u2019 Clubs and Kiwanis Clubs all over the country for decades, only to become diminished in the age of anonymous strip malls.</p> <p>Contributing to local philanthropies is also a part of creating a sustainable business, says Brett deLeuze. Every Monday, a staffer at the vineyard hands out healthy snacks to children at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Napa. When its main clubhouse needed refurbishment, ZD Wines donated $100,000.</p> <p>In 2006, the family joined forces with the UC Davis Medical Center to launch the deLeuze Family Endowment for a Non-toxic Cure for Lymphoma, which currently values $915,000. The cause remains close to heart, as ZD founder Norman deLeuze lost his battle with cancer in 2007.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to do what you believe in,\u201d says Brett deLeuze, and it will have a positive impact. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to help people. We\u2019re trying to create a better society and we\u2019re doing what we can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-591276c0-ad16-426d-b90e-8a6a0558534f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/20/1387556821576/3dcc6b84-8c7c-42be-8aa4-7aa508bba2cd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"ZD Wines\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A grape pit at ZD Wines. Photograph: /ZD Wines</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Entrepreneurs in today\u2019s age of e-commerce and sophisticated retail have also embraced sustainability.&#xa0;</p> <p>Dissatisfied with their corporate post-college jobs, former roommates, Mark Spera and Dean Ramadan, teamed up to create a more fulfilling business of their own.</p> <p>Inspired by lines like Toms Shoes and Patagonia, they came up with BeGood Clothing: a retail store that only carries brands that are charitable and meet strict environmental and social responsibility standards.</p> <p>\u201cIt occurred to us that there was no one true marketplace bringing together all the best brands for sustainability,\u201d says Mark Spera \u2013 at least not with a strong fashion element or competitive prices. The two began scouring the Internet for eco-friendly, fair-trade and humanitarian brands that fit the look they hoped for. Finding and vetting enough of them to launch was a complicated task, Spera says.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew early on that we were on to something,\u201d he says. Still, Spera and Ramadan kept their day jobs until they felt confident with their concept. They researched labor conditions, where the products are made and more, Spera says. \u201cWe even turned away brands.\u201d</p> <p>BeGood Clothing opened in August 2012. The flagship store, located in San Francisco\u2019s Cow Hollow neighborhood, is also eco-friendly. Racks and shelves are made of repurposed materials; the floors of reclaimed wood. Quick success helped the co-owners push forward a website launch, in time for the holidays.</p> <p>As with ZD wines, philanthropy is a central element of BeGood\u2019s approach. It\u2019s working with Project Open Hand, a local charity that delivers nourishing meals to seniors and the critically ill. For each item purchased by one of four lines (Amour Vert, Alternative Apparel, Elroy or BeGood\u2019s own label), the store donates one meal for a person in need. It has already contributed more than 1,000 meals. Other efforts include volunteering and park cleanups.&#xa0;Customers are encouraged to drop off used clothing at the store, and receive a 10% discount on purchases for doing so. BeGood then donates the items to Goodwill.</p> <p>A second location is a possibility, says Spera. But for now, he and Ramadan are&#xa0;focusing on boosting the online part of the business.&#xa0;Not surprisingly, millennials are a big target market for them. Spera and Ramadan plan a college&#xa0;campus tour in early November, to spread word about sustainability and BeGood.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to be near-sighted,\u201d Spera warns business leaders, especially when investors want to see quick earnings. But when working toward more socially responsible practices, he says, it\u2019s important to remember: \u201cThis is a long term thing. We didn\u2019t pop up overnight; this is years of growth in the making.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d4d83b07-02b6-4f78-bf60-829f069c1f33\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/20/1387557448695/ebf7573d-b05b-4178-9706-d3f5cc72a525-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"begood\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Spera and Dean Ramadan&nbsp;of BeGood.

      "bodyText": "The deLeuze family of ZD Wines, located in California\u2019s picturesque Napa Valley, has a history of eco-friendly practices that spans three generations. It all started, however, with bugs. The winery\u2019s late founder, Norman deLeuze, undertook organic farming in the early 80s, after an outbreak of \u201cgrape leafhoppers\u201d infested his cabernet sauvignon vineyard. \u201cHe called the farm advisor and asked what to do about it,\u201d recalls deLeuze\u2019s son Brett, who manages the business with his mother, Rosa Lee, and brother, Robert. The prescribed pesticide listed several health warnings \u2013 one of which discouraged entering the vineyard for three days. The potentially harmful effects alarmed Norman, Brett deLeuze says. \u201cHe decided that was the last time he\u2019d ever do that.\u201d The biggest challenge since has been finding alternative pest and weed control for their combined 33-acres of vineyards. Since ploughing weeds by hand is labor intensive and expensive, the winemaking team uses flaming devices to torch seedlings before they sprout. Natural predators \u2013 like bats, owls and ladybugs \u2013 keep pests off plants. The deLeuze experience is one that a lot of small businesses can relate to: sometimes, making your business sustainable is not just a moral choice. It\u2019s a practical one. Yet, becoming sustainable, eco-friendly, and socially responsible is that the kind of thing that a lot of pragmatic business owners find it easy to dismiss as a lot of trendy, hippie jargon. The assumption among businesses for years has been that a quality product is all you need to attract customers. That\u2019s no longer true. Consumers, especially millennials, increasingly want to buy products that are of good quality \u2013 and give back to society. Becoming socially responsible is more work, which means getting entrepreneurs and business owners to embrace it has been a challenge. When cash is tight, it\u2019s easier and cheaper to order a harmful pesticide than it is to wait for bats to kill your bugs. Increasingly, however, it looks like there won\u2019t be a choice. A 2012 Nielsen survey revealed that two-thirds of consumers prefer buying from companies that give back to society and the environment. There is also a penalty for businesses who screw up, so that pesticide might end up being more expensive than it looks at first. Around 90% of consumers would even boycott a company if they learned of irresponsible practices, a report by Cone Communications/Echo Global found. Companies aren\u2019t saving money if they\u2019re losing customers. Still, making the business case \u2013 that being eco-friendly and sustainable can also be profitable \u2013 is the major challenge facing those who want companies to start embracing an ethical agenda as much as a financial one. Being eco-friendly and socially thoughtful is an overhaul of what we know about business: it requires business owners to reconsider everything from suppliers to which products to stock on the shelves. Seri McClendon, CEO of Clean Agency, assesses how companies work and helps them create plans to become more socially responsible. Once small-business owners learn how to be socially responsible, \u201cit\u2019s hard to go back to business as usual,\u201d she says. When business leaders want to be more socially responsible, there are key steps they can take. The first is to start small. \u201cJust take the low hanging fruit first,\u201d suggests Paul Dolan, a wine-grower whose business centers around sustainable vineyard and the author of True to Our Roots: Fermenting a Business Revolution. Dolan says that starting with simple tasks, like recycling more or volunteering, can eventually lead to greater goals. Each additional challenge leadership takes on, Dolan says, \u201cwill open new insights into what\u2019s next.\u201d For the deLeuzes, they started small \u2013 organic farming, fighting pesticides \u2013 and then increased their efforts to be socially sustainable. The winery\u2019s Rutherford estate, which houses its cellar, tasting room and offices, now runs exclusively on solar power. Two on-site electric car chargers are available for public use; another is located at ZD\u2019s Carneros district property. Additionally, the wine-making team composts grape skins, seeds and stems from each harvest and adds it to the soil. An extensive water recycling system plays a role in the estate\u2019s sustainability, along with recycling everything from office paper to wine bottles. \u201cWe believe in not wasting,\u201d says Brett deLeuze. It\u2019s a custom that stems from his father\u2019s parents and continues through the latest generation of proprietors and employees. \u201cWe try to stay aware and are constantly trying to do even better.\u201d Sustainability goes beyond what happens in a company\u2019s own headquarters. Many small businesses in the past knew it was smart to help the community \u2013 a commitment that drove Lions\u2019 Clubs and Kiwanis Clubs all over the country for decades, only to become diminished in the age of anonymous strip malls. Contributing to local philanthropies is also a part of creating a sustainable business, says Brett deLeuze. Every Monday, a staffer at the vineyard hands out healthy snacks to children at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Napa. When its main clubhouse needed refurbishment, ZD Wines donated $100,000. In 2006, the family joined forces with the UC Davis Medical Center to launch the deLeuze Family Endowment for a Non-toxic Cure for Lymphoma, which currently values $915,000. The cause remains close to heart, as ZD founder Norman deLeuze lost his battle with cancer in 2007. \u201cYou have to do what you believe in,\u201d says Brett deLeuze, and it will have a positive impact. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to help people. We\u2019re trying to create a better society and we\u2019re doing what we can.\u201d Entrepreneurs in today\u2019s age of e-commerce and sophisticated retail have also embraced sustainability. Dissatisfied with their corporate post-college jobs, former roommates, Mark Spera and Dean Ramadan, teamed up to create a more fulfilling business of their own. Inspired by lines like Toms Shoes and Patagonia, they came up with BeGood Clothing: a retail store that only carries brands that are charitable and meet strict environmental and social responsibility standards. \u201cIt occurred to us that there was no one true marketplace bringing together all the best brands for sustainability,\u201d says Mark Spera \u2013 at least not with a strong fashion element or competitive prices. The two began scouring the Internet for eco-friendly, fair-trade and humanitarian brands that fit the look they hoped for. Finding and vetting enough of them to launch was a complicated task, Spera says. \u201cWe knew early on that we were on to something,\u201d he says. Still, Spera and Ramadan kept their day jobs until they felt confident with their concept. They researched labor conditions, where the products are made and more, Spera says. \u201cWe even turned away brands.\u201d BeGood Clothing opened in August 2012. The flagship store, located in San Francisco\u2019s Cow Hollow neighborhood, is also eco-friendly. Racks and shelves are made of repurposed materials; the floors of reclaimed wood. Quick success helped the co-owners push forward a website launch, in time for the holidays. As with ZD wines, philanthropy is a central element of BeGood\u2019s approach. It\u2019s working with Project Open Hand, a local charity that delivers nourishing meals to seniors and the critically ill. For each item purchased by one of four lines (Amour Vert, Alternative Apparel, Elroy or BeGood\u2019s own label), the store donates one meal for a person in need. It has already contributed more than 1,000 meals. Other efforts include volunteering and park cleanups. Customers are encouraged to drop off used clothing at the store, and receive a 10% discount on purchases for doing so. BeGood then donates the items to Goodwill. A second location is a possibility, says Spera. But for now, he and Ramadan are focusing on boosting the online part of the business. Not surprisingly, millennials are a big target market for them. Spera and Ramadan plan a college campus tour in early November, to spread word about sustainability and BeGood. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to be near-sighted,\u201d Spera warns business leaders, especially when investors want to see quick earnings. But when working toward more socially responsible practices, he says, it\u2019s important to remember: \u201cThis is a long term thing. We didn\u2019t pop up overnight; this is years of growth in the making.\u201d The practices that work for small businesses work for bigger ones too. With more than 10 major bottled water brands under its umbrella, including Arrowhead, Poland Springs, Nestl\u00e9 Pure Life and others, Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America is one of the largest bottled water companies in the country. The first sustainable packaging effort started in the mid-1990s, when NWNA introduced their half-liter PET plastic bottles.

      "standfirst": "<p>Though social impact investing is a growing asset class, corporations aren't buying into the promise of sustainability &ndash; yet</p>", 
      "body": "<p>In the spring of 2011, Burn Manufacturing, a small social impact business, caught the eye of General Electric representatives at a Fortune Brainstorm Green Conference.</p> <p>A maker of sustainable burning stoves for communities in Africa, Burn Manufacturing was in its infancy when GE expressed an interest in investing funds into the smaller company. For more than&#xa0;two years, Burn Manufacturing eagerly engaged in discussions with GE before coming away with&#xa0;a $1m loan.</p> <p>The GE money played an important role in getting the company off the ground, particularly in helping to build a stove manufacturing plant in Nairobi, Kenya. But <a href=\"http://www.burnmanufacturing.com/\">Burn Manufacturing</a> isn\u2019t expecting another corporation to make a direct investment like GE did.</p> <p>\"We hear more from corporations who are willing to engage in strategic partnerships, in branding or distribution for example,\" said Boston Nyer, a co-founder of Burn Manufacturing.</p> <p>This isn't unusual. For all of the talk around impact investing, few large corporations are actually putting money into sustainable small companies. Instead, most are using arm's-length arrangements like long-term grants and partnerships.</p> <p>Social impact investing \u2013 directly giving money to sustainable companies with the expectation of a return \u2013 is a fairly new way of helping the environment while seeing a profit. In a JP Morgan/Global Impact Investing Network report, investors said they planned to commit $9bn to impact investing in 2013, up from a total commitment of $8bn in 2012.</p> <p>But little of that money is coming from big corporations. In fact, the percentage of corporate impact investing is so small, there's no hard data to measure their role, said Sonal Shah, <a href=\"http://casefoundation.org/about/staff/senior-fellow\">a senior fellow at the Case Foundation</a>.</p> <p>Right now, there is not a way to measure how much corporations have invested in social impact enterprises, unless they are self-reporting,\" she said. \"We also do not have a good idea of how much corporations are investing overall in impact investing.\"</p> <h2>The end of 'greenwashing'</h2> <p>There is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/greenwash\">pressure to put an end to \"greenwashing\"</a>, or allowing companies to make modest nods to social impact to cover for larger environmental ills. Direct impact investing is expect to increase as corporations face increasing pressure from stakeholders to step outside of their comfort zone and engage more directly in making a social impact.</p> <p>\u201cBefore, the idea of talking about sustainability or writing a passable report worked. You could green wash and it worked for a while\u201d, said Chet Reynders, chairman and CEO of Reynders, McVeigh capital Management. \"Now it's gotten to a point where this idea of transparency -- this idea of recognizing that social liabilities are real liabilities -- these ideas have become more hard-coated as very, very bright people has gotten engaged in sustainability\".</p> <p>To be sure, there are already corporations heavily working in this arena. Along with GE, Shell, Cisco, Dell and a few others have put financial commitments into social impact companies. But this is primarily a world where foundations, <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/cs?pagename=JPM_redesign/JPM_Content_C/Generic_Detail_Page_Template&amp;cid=1320520996264&amp;c=JPM_Content_C\">banks and institutional investors dominate the space</a>.</p> <p>So up until now, why hasn\u2019t more big businesses embraced direct social impact investing? There are a few major reasons.</p> <h2><strong>No definitive description </strong></h2> <p>One area that may contribute to the low number of corporate participation is the fluidity of the term. It seems \"impact\" investing means different things to different companies.</p> <p>For example, many corporations, like Gap Inc, use their overall sustainable policies to \"<a href=\"http://gapinc.com/content/csr/html.html\">invest\" in positive environmental action</a>.&#xa0;Others use their purchasing power to invest in sustainable action.&#xa0;Microsoft recently announced a 20-year <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft-green/archive/2013/11.aspx\">power purchase agreement for wind energy in Texas</a> by agreeing to purchase the entire 110 megawatts of energy that will be generated by the Keechi wind farm.</p> <p>Some big companies operate sustainable impact through their corporate foundations.&#xa0;The Levi Strauss Foundation has provided nearly $1m in grants to micro-finance company Earn, as part of the <a href=\"levistrauss.com/about/foundations/levi-strauss-foundation/issues-we-support#asset\">corporation's asset building strategy</a>.</p> <p>MasterCard\u2019s foundation said that it has teamed up with One Acre Fund to launch a $10m partnership that will increase incomes of Africa\u2019s smallholder farmers and grow its microfinance sector<a href=\"http://www.oneacrefund.org/blogs/information/post/the-mastercard-foundation-and-one-acre-fund-launch-10-million-partnership/717\">.</a>&#xa0;Still others, <a href=\"https://www.missioninvestors.org/news/opportunity-finance-network-and-starbucks-collaborate-create-jobs-usa-initiative\">like Starbucks</a>, put together key partnerships to advance a social good.</p> <h2><strong>Corporations don't like uncertainties</strong></h2> <p>Corporations are not known for being risk takers, especially with money. Impact investing is a markedly different way of using business dollars to make sustainable changes.</p> <p>Sometimes, in order for it to work, corporations have to be financial pioneers.

      "bodyText": "In the spring of 2011, Burn Manufacturing, a small social impact business, caught the eye of General Electric representatives at a Fortune Brainstorm Green Conference. A maker of sustainable burning stoves for communities in Africa, Burn Manufacturing was in its infancy when GE expressed an interest in investing funds into the smaller company. For more than two years, Burn Manufacturing eagerly engaged in discussions with GE before coming away with a $1m loan. The GE money played an important role in getting the company off the ground, particularly in helping to build a stove manufacturing plant in Nairobi, Kenya. But Burn Manufacturing isn\u2019t expecting another corporation to make a direct investment like GE did. \"We hear more from corporations who are willing to engage in strategic partnerships, in branding or distribution for example,\" said Boston Nyer, a co-founder of Burn Manufacturing. This isn't unusual. For all of the talk around impact investing, few large corporations are actually putting money into sustainable small companies. Instead, most are using arm's-length arrangements like long-term grants and partnerships. Social impact investing \u2013 directly giving money to sustainable companies with the expectation of a return \u2013 is a fairly new way of helping the environment while seeing a profit. In a JP Morgan/Global Impact Investing Network report, investors said they planned to commit $9bn to impact investing in 2013, up from a total commitment of $8bn in 2012. But little of that money is coming from big corporations. In fact, the percentage of corporate impact investing is so small, there's no hard data to measure their role, said Sonal Shah, a senior fellow at the Case Foundation. Right now, there is not a way to measure how much corporations have invested in social impact enterprises, unless they are self-reporting,\" she said. \"We also do not have a good idea of how much corporations are investing overall in impact investing.\" The end of 'greenwashing' There is pressure to put an end to \"greenwashing\", or allowing companies to make modest nods to social impact to cover for larger environmental ills. Direct impact investing is expect to increase as corporations face increasing pressure from stakeholders to step outside of their comfort zone and engage more directly in making a social impact. \u201cBefore, the idea of talking about sustainability or writing a passable report worked. You could green wash and it worked for a while\u201d, said Chet Reynders, chairman and CEO of Reynders, McVeigh capital Management. \"Now it's gotten to a point where this idea of transparency -- this idea of recognizing that social liabilities are real liabilities -- these ideas have become more hard-coated as very, very bright people has gotten engaged in sustainability\". To be sure, there are already corporations heavily working in this arena. Along with GE, Shell, Cisco, Dell and a few others have put financial commitments into social impact companies. But this is primarily a world where foundations, banks and institutional investors dominate the space. So up until now, why hasn\u2019t more big businesses embraced direct social impact investing? There are a few major reasons. No definitive description One area that may contribute to the low number of corporate participation is the fluidity of the term. It seems \"impact\" investing means different things to different companies. For example, many corporations, like Gap Inc, use their overall sustainable policies to \"invest\" in positive environmental action. Others use their purchasing power to invest in sustainable action. Microsoft recently announced a 20-year power purchase agreement for wind energy in Texas by agreeing to purchase the entire 110 megawatts of energy that will be generated by the Keechi wind farm. Some big companies operate sustainable impact through their corporate foundations. The Levi Strauss Foundation has provided nearly $1m in grants to micro-finance company Earn, as part of the corporation's asset building strategy. MasterCard\u2019s foundation said that it has teamed up with One Acre Fund to launch a $10m partnership that will increase incomes of Africa\u2019s smallholder farmers and grow its microfinance sector. Still others, like Starbucks, put together key partnerships to advance a social good. Corporations don't like uncertainties Corporations are not known for being risk takers, especially with money. Impact investing is a markedly different way of using business dollars to make sustainable changes. Sometimes, in order for it to work, corporations have to be financial pioneers. That\u2019s because many of these new sustainable businesses have a short financial track record which likely means that corporations may be the first to write them a check. Being first may not sit well in a lot of boardrooms. Uncertainty around the potential success of a company can also make investors nervous. A fancy web page and a solid business model isn't always an indicator of just how well a company will do. Sometimes a great concept doesn't translate into making a profit. Limited financial gain It hasn't escaped corporate notice that social impact companies aren't exactly money makers. Experts say that on average, impact investment returns are in the 3-5% range. \"You have to sacrifice money to invest in companies that are being socially progressive,\" Reynders said. \"That's something that should be expected.\" Getting past the notion of narrow profits for the greater social good doesn\u2019t usually work well with corporations that are used to making a healthy profits year over year. \"It may be that you are growing a market and you're going to have a longer return profile as opposed to short term,\" Shah said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get your money back in five years or six years or seven year. It's investing in the growth of businesses.\" A hybrid form of impact investing It may be that corporations embrace a mixture of investing that also includes grants. Opportunity Fund is one example of this form of impact investing. JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi, and Bank of America are among the corporations that have invested $9.5m into Opportunity Fund over the last two years. Opportunity Fund uses this capital to make small business loans in California. Those corporations also provided grants to Opportunity Fund, to help underwrite the costs to make the loans. However you cut it, corporate impact investing will increase in some fashion. \u201cI think this a very exciting time for folks in the investment and the social enterprise space. I think we're going to continue to see companies approach investment differently,\u201d said Cynthia Muller, director of impact investing at Arabella Advisors. \u201cI think we're going to continue see a maturation of companies looking beyond just making a grant and really look at it as, what are the opportunities and what's the intention of our investment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There were warnings Britain's economic recovery was on shaky ground on Friday after official data showed the country's current account deficit with the rest of the world soared to its highest since 1989. Dealing a blow to chancellor George Osborne's push for a Britain that can \"pay its way\" in the world, the gap \u2013 Britain's trade deficit, plus the losses UK plc makes on its overseas ventures \u2013 ballooned to \u00a321bn in the three months to September from a deficit of \u00a36bn in the previous quarter. As a percentage of GDP, the deficit was 5.1%, the biggest share for more than 20 years, the Office for National Statistics said. There was similarly downbeat news for the government's push to rebalance the economy from figures on what has been driving growth, and separate ONS data showed that public finances deteriorated last month. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \"As the chancellor looks at the latest GDP figures, he's likely to reach for a glass of wine and indigestion tablets at the same time. The strength of GDP, with faster year-on-year growth, will be a cause for celebration. But the sources of that growth will make him uncomfortable.\" While GDP was confirmed to have picked up 0.8% in the third quarter, the detailed breakdown suggested consumers have been driving down their savings. But the economy had performed a little better than previously thought in preceding quarters, and growth on a year earlier was revised up to 1.9% from 1.5%, the ONS said. Economists, however, largely focused on signs that squeezed households continued to be relied upon to drive growth despite a push for exports and manufacturing to take the lead. That echoed a warning earlier on Friday from ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) about the sustainability of the recovery. \"The national accounts for the third quarter provide a few reasons to doubt that the UK's economic recovery will be able to maintain its current strong pace for much longer,\" said Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics. He pointed to figures showing real incomes grew 0.4% on the quarter but spending was up 0.8%, suggesting people were eating into their savings to spend. \"Lower saving can only support growth in spending for so long. Meanwhile, the current account deficit widened \u2026 So for now, the economy's growth spurt seems to be exacerbating existing imbalances in the economy, rather than helping them to heal,\" Tombs added. The Treasury welcomed the upgrades to previous growth numbers from the ONS but conceded there was much more work to be done. \"Today's data shows that the recovery has been stronger than previously thought and that the government's long-term economic plan is working. But risks remain and the job is not done, so the government will go on taking the difficult decisions needed to deliver a responsible recovery for all,\" said a spokesman. There was some good news for Osborne on Friday when S&amp;P affirmed the UK's AAA rating. But it said the outlook remained negative. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which has been campaigning for more government help for companies that want to export, described Friday's data as a \"mixed bag\". With the economy now 2% smaller than before the crisis, according to the ONS, the BCC welcomed progress on closing the gap on pre-recession times. \"The upward revisions to earlier quarters support our view that the UK's economic performance has been stronger than initially thought,\" said the BCC's chief economist, David Kern. \"But concerns still remain \u2026 While it is good news that we are recovering, and that earlier quarters were better than previously thought, the large current account deficit highlights the importance of prioritising measures to boost exports.\" The ONS data on the latest state of the public coffers showed net borrowing, excluding various temporary effects, was \u00a316.5bn in November, up almost a \u00a31bn on a year earlier. Last month's performance took underlying borrowing in the fiscal year to date to \u00a384bn, which is 2.2% lower on the same period a year earlier.",

      "bodyText": "Inmarsat has slipped nearly 2% on caution over its US partner LightSquared. The satellite company reported some good news this week, signing a deal with space company Astrium Services to distribute its Global Xpress high speed broadband service. The first Global Xpress satellite was launched earlier this month, and worldwide coverage is expected by the end of 2014. Inmarsat also unveiled the $45m purchase of maritime communications specialist Globe Wireless. But there is uncertainty over LightSquared, which went into bankruptcy protection. US group Dish has offered to buy the business, but a rival bid from private equity firm Centerbridge has fallen through, leaving LightSquared's arrangements with Inmarsat up in the air again. The company's shares have fallen 13.5p to 746.5p, and analysts at Berenberg issued a hold note, albeit edging up their price target from 740p to 745p.

      "bodyText": "BAE shares dropped on Friday as investors reacted to its failure to win a \u00a36bn contract to sell fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates. The UK arms manufacturer revealed after the market closed on Thursday that more than a year of talks to supply 60 Typhoon aircraft to the UAE had failed. BAE also said vital negotiations with the Saudi government over the pricing of an existing Typhoon contract, watched closely by shareholders, would drag into next year. BAE shares fell as low as 422p in response to the news and were down 3.9% at 424p in early morning trading. The news is a serious setback for BAE as it seeks to reduce its reliance on US and British defence markets hit by government spending cuts. BAE's search for new sources of revenue has seen it pursue a failed merger with the Airbus owner EADS and launch a major push into emerging defence markets such as the UAE and India. The company said on Thursday it had not built the prospect of a successful outcome in the UAE into its financial plans. The news was a blow not only to BAE but also to the prime minister, who intervened last month to try to secure a deal that would have been a significant boost for British exports. During a visit to the UAE, David Cameron urged Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, to opt for the Typhoon over a rival fighter produced by France's Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. BAE also said it was still in talks with the Saudi government about the terms of its contract to supply 72 Typhoons to the country. A deal was signed in 2007 but it included provisions for renegotiation as economic conditions changed. The Saudi negotiations are being followed keenly by investors. BAE is buying back \u00a31bn of its shares to boost investor returns but has said completing the buyback depends on resolving the Saudi talks.",

      "bodyText": "Heavily indebted homeowners will be hit hard if interest rates start to rise before wages have picked up, according to research by the Bank of England that underlines the dilemma facing policymakers as the economy recovers. Amid speculation that borrowing costs may have to increase sooner than expected as unemployment falls and the housing market picks up, the Bank's study, published in its Quarterly Bulletin, suggests rate-setters will have to tread carefully. The findings come as fresh evidence emerges of the renewed strength of the housing market, with the Council of Mortgage Lenders reporting a 30% increase in mortgage lending in the year to November. Drawing on a detailed survey conducted by consultancy NMG, the Bank finds that average household debt remains high, at \u00a387,000, and any rate rise that was not accompanied by an increase in real wages could push a growing proportion of borrowers close to the edge. \"Higher interest rates would increase debt-servicing costs for households, but the extent to which that may pose problems for households in the future will depend on how much incomes increase before rates rise,\" it says. If interest rates were lifted to 3% from their current record low of 0.5%, it would almost double the proportion of those the Bank calls \"vulnerable mortgagors\" \u2013 those forced to spend at least 35% of their pre-tax income on repayments \u2013 to 16%, unless incomes had risen in the interim. Even if incomes have jumped by 10% by the time rates reach 3%, the study shows, the proportion of vulnerable borrowers would still increase by half, to 12%. Almost half of mortgage-borrowers said that a rate rise on this scale \u2013 to 3% \u2013 would force them to take action of some kind. requesting longer working hours, for example, in order to afford the higher repayments, unless their wages had also gone up. Bank governor Mark Carney has stressed that he will leave interest rates on hold at least until the unemployment rate falls below 7%, something the Bank doesn't expect to happen until at least 2015. But with the jobless rate falling faster than expected, hitting 7.4% in the three months to October, City investors are speculating that policy may have to be tightened sooner. Matthew Whittaker, senior economist at thinktank the Resolution Foundation, said the impact of rising rates would also depend on whether more generous wage deals were widely spread, or concentrated among higher earners. \"The really tricky bit for the Bank of England is if you start to get rising inflationary pressure because of spending by affluent people, but people at the bottom who still haven't dealt with the debt hangover from the good years don't see any real income growth.\" The latest research will help to support the argument that rushing to a rate rise could have damaging consequences. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \"Household budgets remain under immense strain and any upward move in interest rates could be enough to tip many families over the edge.\" Carney has stressed that he does not think interest rates should rise simply in order to tame the housing market: instead, he sees the Bank's new Financial Policy Committee as the first line of defence against overheating property prices. The FPC has already cancelled the element of the Bank's Funding for Lending Scheme which supported cheap mortgage borrowing, and it could demand that banks hold more capital against mortgages if it believes a bubble is starting to inflate. However, the Treasury is pressing ahead with its Help to Buy scheme, which will offer taxpayer-backed mortgage guarantees to borrowers who can only raise a small deposit. In a separate article in today's Quarterly Bulletin, the Bank shows that small businesses could also be vulnerable to rising interest rates, unless economic conditions have improved in the meantime. The Bank's economists have investigated the phenomenon of \"forbearance\", under which banks have tended to give distressed business borrowers an easy ride during the crisis, rather than forcing them into default. In total, the study found that around 6% of small- and medium-sized business borrowers, representing 14% of banks' exposure to the sector, were \"in receipt of some form of loan forbearance\" in 2013. The Bank does not believe these \"zombie firms\", as they are sometimes known, are jeopardising financial stability, and it argues that while propping up firms instead of letting them go bust could lead to a misallocation of resources across the economy, it is unlikely to be the explanation for much of the collapse in productivity in the UK since the crisis. However, the researchers warn that the extent of forbearance means some small firms would be in danger if rates rise too soon. \"Results from this investigation suggest that firm default rates could increase in response to a rise in interest rates, especially if not accompanied by an improvement in economic conditions,\" it said.",
