      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s bailout inspectors are returning to Athens to seek changes to the country\u2019s tax, pensions and labour market laws in a sign that the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, will give way to European pressure for deeper reforms. His government agreed at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Monday to talks on big economic reforms in exchange for progress on releasing the next instalment of bailout funds. In return, Europe signalled a winding back of austerity measures for the struggling nation, in a move that could end a dispute between EU creditors and the International Monetary Fund over how to deal with Greece. But the announcement sparked anger in Greece, where the main opposition party accused the government of caving in while the economy was weak. \u201cThe government is celebrating the return of the institutions to Greece while the economy is sinking,\u201d said the centre-right New Democracy group. Senior EU officials promised economic pressures would be lifted. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic affairs, said: \u201cWe need to show [the Greek people] that there is light at the end of the tunnel of austerity. Everyone has agreed on this fundamental principle.\u201d Officials from the European commission, the European Central Bank, the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism (EU bailout fund) will arrive in Athens \u201cin the very short-term\u201d to work with the Greek government on reforms to tax, pensions and labour markets, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the Eurogroup. Speaking after the meeting in Brussels, he said it was too early to make a decision on unlocking the next tranche of Greece\u2019s \u20ac86bn (\u00a373bn) bailout, but he hoped agreement on reforms would make a disbursal of funds possible. Greece was represented at the meeting by its finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos. The return of the creditors to Athens has raised hopes they will agree among themselves on how to handle Greece\u2019s debt mountain. The IMF has so far declined to get involved in the latest bailout because it believes that refusing to write off some of the Greek debt burden will crush Greece\u2019s economic prospects. In contrast, the EU institutions argue that deferring repayment terms \u2013 rather than waiving payments \u2013 will allow the Greek economy to grow and pay its dues. Amid the deadlock, Tsipras has vowed not to accept one euro more of austerity, beyond what Athens has already agreed. Offering some hope, Dijsselbloem picked up this demand, saying: \u201cThere will be a change in the policy mix, if you will, moving, perhaps, away from austerity and putting more emphasis on deep reforms.\u201d But he declined to endorse Tsipras\u2019s words and said the outcome would depend on reforms agreed. But vague talk of ending austerity did not go down well in Greece. \u201cAs was expected the \u2026 government accepted the legislation of a new package of unpopular measures that will be enforced after 2018 plus all those that are included in the current programme,\u201d said the communist KKE party. Calling on Greeks to take to the streets in mass protest on Tuesday, the party added: \u201cWhatever the government says about reforms without fiscal cost and counter measures is just another attempt at deceiving people, only this time it can\u2019t persuade anyone.\u201d The Greek finance ministry has said the government\u2019s debt load is now \u20ac226.36bn after increasing by \u20ac2.65bn on the previous quarter. Dimitris Tzanakopoulos, a government spokesman, said what had been achieved in Brussels was an \u201cextremely important development\u201d that finally put dangerous scenarios of Greece leaving the euro to rest. Where revenue-raising measures were imposed, others would be cut, he said. Greece faces a \u20ac7.4bn debt repayment bill in July, making the summer an unofficial deadline for an deal on unlocking the second instalment of the current bailout, the country\u2019s third. Greece\u2019s creditors are optimistic. The country paid \u20ac2bn to the European Stability Mechanism on Monday, hailed by the fund\u2019s managing director, Klaus Regling, as a sign that Greece was a reliable partner. He told the German newspaper Bild that Greece was unlikely to need all of the \u20ac86bn fund because the Greek budget was developing better than expected \u2013 a view that contrasts with some market watchers who think the country is heading for its fourth bailout. The latest eurozone meeting had been seen as the last chance to sort out Greek reforms before Europe enters a critical electoral cycle, starting with Dutch elections on 15 March. Eurozone leaders are now playing down talk of any imminent need for an agreement. \u201cThere is no need for a disbursement in March, April or May. Don\u2019t create deadlines where there are none,\u201d said Dijsselbloem, promising that the cash would be available on time.",

      "bodyText": "Warren Buffett and his Brazilian private equity chums at 3G, the main players at Kraft Heinz, must process their cheese and beans on another planet. The US firm abandoned its \u00a3115bn bid for Unilever, we\u2019re told, because it wasn\u2019t expecting its proposal to receive such hostility from Unilever\u2019s board and a few British and Dutch politicians. If that explanation is correct, Kraft\u2019s crew of billionaires should get out more. Did they miss the debates that have raged over rootless global companies, asset-stripping deals and the UK\u2019s open-doors policy on takeovers? Hostility was predictable and justified. Unilever\u2019s board was always likely to reject the chance to be bought by a financier-led firm in search of another target for its job-cutting formula. Unilever\u2019s chief executive, Paul Polman, lectures the world on the importance of looking beyond the next quarter\u2019s earnings and was not about to trade 100 years of corporate history for an uncertain ride on 3G\u2019s debt-propelled takeover machine. A miserly initial offer, comprising a takeover premium of only 18%, will only have strengthened Unilever\u2019s sense of indignation. Nor should it have required genius to see that Kraft Heinz\u2019s charmless approach to business would be viewed with suspicion elsewhere. Kraft is chiefly remembered in the UK for reneging on a jobs promise made during the takeover battle for Cadbury in 2010. The UK and Dutch governments have an interest in protecting their tax bases against the 3G-style technique of loading acquisitions with debt and thereby reducing taxable earnings. If Buffett and Jorge Paulo Lemann, 3G\u2019s co-founder, couldn\u2019t see outrage in the offing, they were astonishingly naive. The other conclusion is more important than Kraft Heinz\u2019s lack of preparation. Theresa May, as she struggles to define what she means by \u201can economy that works for everyone\u201d, should realise that not every would-be predator will succumb to nerves at the 11th hour. The time is ripe to insist that mega-bids of this type should pass a public interest test. Last July, in her campaign to secure the Tory leadership, May seemed keen on the idea when she cited Pfizer\u2019s failed tilt at AstraZeneca in 2014 and declared: \u201cA proper industrial strategy wouldn\u2019t automatically stop the sale of British firms to foreign ones, but it should be capable of stepping in to defend a sector that is as important as pharmaceuticals is to Britain.\u201d Unilever\u2019s collection of soap suds, margarines and ice creams are not national trophies like AstraZeneca\u2019s science labs, but the point remains: how can you hope to run a successful industrial strategy if your best and biggest companies can be picked off by an opportunist bidder with a greater appetite for debt and less interest in long-term investment? This is not, incidentally, primarily a Brexit question. Unilever\u2019s sterling-denominated shares rose sharply after the referendum because it makes the bulk of its profit overseas, so Kraft Heinz wasn\u2019t merely trying to exploit a currency opportunity. Rather, the primary opportunity was old and familiar \u2013 the fact that it is easier to mount a takeover bid in the UK than in almost every major economy in the world. An open-doors policy on takeovers has some advantages, of course \u2013 it can hold lazy managements\u2019 feet to the fire and avoid the supposed peril of politicians attempting to pick winners. But, come on, Unilever is not some ailing conglomerate in need of revitalisation. It is a successful business that pays reliable dividends and whose share price has doubled since 2010. The appeal for Kraft Heinz is not hard to fathom: the US firm probably calculates that profit margins could be even higher if it ran the business harder and ditched Unilever\u2019s worthy words about behaving with a sense of corporate responsibility. Polman, it should be said, doesn\u2019t always help his own case by sounding so sanctimonious about sustainable capitalism. But his basic approach is sound. Unilever is prepared to be held to account by outsiders in a manner than would be hard to imagine under Kraft Heinz\u2019s ownership. The only certainties in a takeover would have been heavy job losses and higher levels of financial leverage. In those circumstances, it seems reasonable for government to examine takeover plans in detail \u2013 or appoint an independent body to do so \u2013 to see how they fit with the public interest. May, in her speech last summer, got her tone roughly correct: there would not be an automatic right to block a deal and interventions might be rare in practice. But what happened to such sensible talk? The government\u2019s 130-page green paper on industrial strategy in January completely ignored takeover policy. It looked as if May had decided the subject was too difficult to address. She should wake up. The next highly charged bid will probably last longer than 48 hours and voters will want to know why the prime minister failed to acquire powers she promoted herself.

      "bodyText": "The business secretary has promised the government\u2019s \u201cunbounded commitment\u201d to protecting jobs at Vauxhall amid concerns over the carmaker\u2019s future. Fears are growing about plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton as the French owner of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn, PSA Group, presses ahead with talks to buy General Motors\u2019 European business, which includes Opel in Germany and Vauxhall in the UK. Greg Clark told the House of Commons the government would \u201cdo everything we can\u201d to protect Vauxhall and had held constructive talks with the bosses of GM and PSA. Vauxhall employs 4,500 people across its UK production sites and has a pension deficit of as much as \u00a31bn, which pensions experts say could scupper the proposed deal. UK union sources are concerned that the Vauxhall plants will be at the centre of cutbacks after the deal is completed. Clark sought to allay such fears on Monday as he responded to an urgent question from Justin Madders, the MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston. He said: \u201cMy personal commitment and the commitment of this government will be unbounded to make sure the future of the workforce will be maintained. I will of course work with all the groups, including the trade unions, including the workforce, to make that case, if new owners there are to be, to those new owners.\u201d The business secretary\u2019s comments are the latest attempt by the government to show it is behind the automotive industry, after Nissan, which owns Britain\u2019s largest car plant in Sunderland, received assurances that its UK operations would not lose out from the impact of Brexit. Clark said he had made it clear to Dan Ammann, the president of GM, \u201cthe importance we attach to Vauxhall\u2019s presence in the UK and to its workforce\u201d, and that PSA executives told him they had avoided closing plants in recent years. \u201cThe PSA executives said they too greatly value the Vauxhall brand and the commitment of its workforce, and that any deal would build on these strengths,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the points the PSA executives made to me was that since the new management of PSA has been in place, they have taken some pride in having part of their strategy not to close plants.\u201d Clark said the government also recognised the importance of protecting pension benefits for Vauxhall workers. The scheme had a deficit of \u00a3840m at the end of 2014, according to regulatory filings, but analysts estimate that it could now be more than \u00a31bn. John Ralfe, a pensions expert, said: \u201cIn relation to the size of the company, that is a big deficit. It\u2019s been a big number for quite a few years.\u201d PSA would be \u201crip-roaring bonkers\u201d to take on the pension scheme, he added. \u201cIf GM is prepared to keep the pensions liability, then the deal will go ahead. But Peugeot is not going to take on the pension liabilities, that is just inconceivable.\u201d Ralfe said he was surprised that GM had not reassured Vauxhall workers about their pension benefits. Union leaders said it was heartening that MPs had spoken in support of Vauxhall workers. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, said: \u201cThese are very anxious days for the thousands of skilled men and women in Vauxhall, and the working-class communities relying on GM\u2019s supply chain for their livelihoods. \u201cSo it was helpful to hear Greg Clark update the Commons on developments. It is absolutely vital that GM and Peugeot understand that the UK government is prepared to move heaven and earth to safeguard our plants. \u201cI repeat, the UK government must match, if not more, whatever political and financial support that the French and German governments are giving their plants and workers.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unilever forced Kraft Heinz to abandon its \u00a3115bn bid for the company after the Anglo-Dutch maker of Marmite and Flora said it would use every tool at its disposal to fend off a deal. The US consumer goods firm behind Philadelphia and WeightWatchers withdrew its offer \u201camicably\u201d on Sunday evening, just 48 hours after admitting interest in its much larger rival. The rapid volte face saw Unilever\u2019s shares fall by nearly 8% on Monday \u2013 their worst one-day performance since 2008 \u2013 after soaring by 13% on Friday to a record high when the firm revealed it had knocked back an initial approach. Well-placed sources said Kraft Heinz\u2019s key investors \u2013 investment guru Warren Buffett and private equity tycoon Jorge Lemann \u2013 were forced into a chastening retreat after Unilever made clear the company stood no chance of sealing the second-largest corporate deal in history. Unilever, led by Dutch chief executive Paul Polman, is understood to have warned the duo over the weekend that there was no appetite for the offer at boardroom level and that investors were highly unlikely to be swayed. One well-placed source said Unilever had gone \u201con the offensive\u201d, catching Kraft Heinz unawares and forcing the company to \u201cwave the white flag\u201d. \u201cIt became clear [to Kraft Heinz] that there was very little chance the deal would ever happen,\u201d the source said. Kraft Heinz\u2019s position was further weakened by the fact that rumours of the deal leaked before the US company was ready. This meant Kraft did not have the time to woo key investors before going public with its interest. Unilever shareholders, 70% of whom are long-term investors who have held their shares for more than seven years, are also thought to have been sceptical about the benefits of the proposal. Kraft\u2019s offer was made partly in shares but mostly in cash, about \u00a370bn, a sum that would have been funded by debt. This heavily-leveraged business model would have dragged down Unilever\u2019s credit rating, leaving the combined company laden with a huge debt pile incurring substantial repayment costs. \u201cShareholders were effectively being offered a deal funded by their own money,\u201d said one source familiar with the situation. Such a swift withdrawal is unheard of for Lemann and Buffett, neither of whom are accustomed to tasting defeat in a major bid battle. Lemann\u2019s Brazilian buyout house 3G was instrumental in securing brewer ABInBev\u2019s takeover of SABMiller, while Buffett \u2013 often dubbed the Sage of Omaha for his deal-making prowess \u2013 was among the masterminds behind Kraft\u2019s merger with Heinz in 2015. While business minister Greg Clark spoke to Unilever and Kraft on Friday, government sources played down reports that Kraft was put off by the threat of intervention from government. But Kraft Heinz will have been aware of Theresa May\u2019s scepticism over foreign takeovers, including the controversial takeover of Cadbury by Kraft in 2010 when it reneged on commitments to save jobs. That deal prompted a change in the takeover code that provided for commitments made during the acquisition process to be made legally binding. That would have left Kraft, whose backers are famed for tough cost-cutting, facing pressure to safeguard the combined firm\u2019s 9,000 UK jobs, including Unilever\u2019s London office and several production facilities. Earlier this year Japan\u2019s Softbank became the first overseas buyer to be affected by the new provisions, as part of its \u00a324bn takeover of chip designer ARM Holdings. The Japanese firm promised to keep ARM\u2019s headquarters in the UK and double its UK headcount over the course of five years.",

      "bodyText": "It may be \u201cunusual\u201d for Unilever\u2019s CEO Paul Polman to be an advocate of sustainable business and tackling global concerns such as poverty and climate change (Kraft Heinz in surprise retreat from \u00a3115bn bid for Unilever, 20 February), but it shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Climate change ruins crops, increases droughts and damages farmers\u2019 livelihoods. Unilever sells foods and household products that need agricultural produce and water for washing, cooking, drinking and cleaning. Combating climate change makes business more sustainable. Lifting people out of poverty in developing countries enables more of them to afford basic everyday life-improving products at a time when developed markets are maturing and people are reaching \u201cpeak stuff\u201d. Helping people live sustainably makes good business sense. The company\u2019s founder, William Lever, built his business on this \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d philosophy. You wonder why more companies don\u2019t get it. It is little wonder Kraft Heinz wanted to get its hands on Unilever\u2019s products when its own are mostly sold in developed markets and struggling to grow. Perhaps if it changed its business model rather than trying to pinch someone else\u2019s business, it would earn not only more income but a reputation more worthy of its founders. Richard Aldwinckle London \u2022 Felicity Lawrence (The supermarket food gamble may be up, 20 February) is right to highlight the risks and costs of the supermarket model \u2013 although I\u2019d also add in the low wages and poor working conditions of workers as a further result of this system. But we should also highlight the possibilities and rewards of building a far more localised food supply system beyond the obviously crucial issue of food security: huge numbers of jobs and small business opportunities, strengthened local economies and fresh food affordably reaching those who need it. Many organisations around the country, from the Kindling Trust in Manchester to Organic Lea in Chingford, Riverside Market Garden outside Cardiff to Sheffield Organic Growers, are doing great work, but we need to make a huge leap in numbers of growers and volume produced. There\u2019s nothing inevitable about the dominance of supermarkets. We need full-scale reformation of how we produce, process and retail food. With innovation we can surely deliver a system that provides far more security from hunger. This should be one of the highest priorities for any government. Natalie Bennett Former Green party leader \u2022 The corporate world has more money than it knows what to do with. The proposed Kraft-Unilever merger would have repeated the mergers and acquisitions frenzies that preceded financial crashes of the past. The \u201ccost savings\u201d that are the \u201cbenefits\u201d of these concatenated companies, reduce consumption in the real economy and eventually tip global markets into recession.

      "body": "<p>It may be \u201cunusual\u201d for Unilever\u2019s CEO Paul Polman to be an advocate of sustainable business and tackling global concerns such as poverty and climate change (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/19/kraft-heinz-unilever-shareholders-lobbies-uk-government-takeoverbid\" title=\"\">Kraft Heinz in surprise retreat from \u00a3115bn bid for Unilever</a>, 20 February), but it shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Climate change ruins crops, increases droughts and damages farmers\u2019 livelihoods. Unilever sells foods and household products that need agricultural produce and water for washing, cooking, drinking and cleaning. Combating climate change makes business more sustainable. Lifting people out of poverty in developing countries enables more of them to afford basic everyday life-improving products at a time when developed markets are maturing and people are reaching \u201cpeak stuff\u201d. Helping people live sustainably makes good business sense. The company\u2019s founder, William Lever, built his business on this \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d philosophy. You wonder why more companies don\u2019t get it.</p> <p>It is little wonder Kraft Heinz wanted to get its hands on Unilever\u2019s products when its own are mostly sold in developed markets and struggling to grow. Perhaps if it changed its business model rather than trying to pinch someone else\u2019s business, it would earn not only more income but a reputation more worthy of its founders.<br><strong>Richard Aldwinckle</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Felicity Lawrence (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/20/supermarket-food-gamble-brexit-climate-migrant\" title=\"\">The supermarket food gamble may be up</a>, 20 February) is right to highlight the risks and costs of the supermarket model \u2013 although I\u2019d also add in the low wages and poor working conditions of workers as a further result of this system. But we should also highlight the possibilities and rewards of building a far more localised food supply system beyond the obviously crucial issue of food security: huge numbers of jobs and small business opportunities, strengthened local economies and fresh food affordably reaching those who need it. Many organisations around the country, from the Kindling Trust in Manchester to Organic Lea in Chingford, Riverside Market Garden outside Cardiff to Sheffield Organic Growers, are doing great work, but we need to make a huge leap in numbers of growers and volume produced. There\u2019s nothing inevitable about the dominance of supermarkets. We need full-scale&#xa0;reformation of how we produce, process and retail food.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Time for a quick wrap-up. Officials representing Greece\u2019s creditors are heading back to Athens after the two sides agreed to discuss new economic reforms. The two sides will draw up fresh tax measures, pension changes and labour market reforms. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says the aim is to move away from austerity and towards structural reforms, and growth-friendly measures to help Greece\u2019s recovery. He told reporters in Brussels that: There will be a change in the policy mix,moving perhaps away from austerity and putting more emphasis on reform.\u201d The plan could break the deadlock which has prevented Greece receiving its next tranche of aid. But there\u2019s no guarantee that agreement will be reached, or that Greece\u2019s parliament will approve it. Dijsselbloem cautioned that it could take some time to agree fresh measures. And while Athens doesn\u2019t face any major debt repayments until the summer, the eurogroup hopes for a deal quickly for \u201cstability reasons and confidence reasons.\u201d Greek bonds are rallying tonight, on hopes that the country will avoid another episode in its long-running debt crisis. In other news... Unilever has suffered its worst day on the stock market since 2008, after Kraft Heinz abandoned its takeover ambitions. Shares ended the day down 6.5%. Shareholders said that Kraft hasn\u2019t offered enough to sway them, while the UK government denied putting its oar in. French government bonds have come under renewed pressure after new polls showed far-right Marine Le Pen gaining support. The gap between France and Germany\u2019s borrowing costs is at its widest level since 2012. British factories have reported a jump in new orders...and warned that they plan to hike prices. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The IMF has issued a cautious statement, welcoming Greece\u2019s commitment to satisfying its creditors...but warning that there\u2019s no guarantee of an agreement on new measures. Dublin MEP Nessa Childers isn\u2019t convinced: Q: Given that Greece and the institutions must agree new measures, and the government must legislate them, when can we realistically expect Greece to get its next bailout payment? There\u2019s still a lot of work to do, and a lot of issues to discuss and calibrate, so I want to temper expectations, Dijsselbloem says. There is no need for a disbursement in March, April or May, he insists. I hope we won\u2019t need all that time - we will have a discussion in the eurogroup once a staff level agreement is agreed. If we do it in March, we\u2019ll do it in March.... If not, we\u2019ll do it later. We\u2019ll do it well in time. Q: Do you think Greece and the institutions will agree a package that persuades the International Monetary Fund to join the bailout, and will you provide the next tranche of bailout funds if not? Dijsselbloem says the IMF wants to see Greece\u2019s economy recovering, and see that its debts are sustainable. So we must get these reforms agreed. The aim is to show that they will help support Greece\u2019s recovery and make its debt sustainable [then the IMF is more likely to come on board]. Dijsselbloem says he can\u2019t put a figure on today\u2019s agreement, as some measures are still being discussed. But what has been agreed is \u201cto the liking of the IMF\u201d he adds. Q: Does today\u2019s agreement mean the end of austerity in Greece?.... Jeroen Dijsselbloem slaps this idea down straight away! I\u2019m a finance minister, he says, I can never promise the end of austerity, as finance ministers must maintain a tight budget and ensure it is sustainable. Greece\u2019s budget is in a much better state than a few years ago, so we are now looking at structural reforms to support the recovery. So there is clearly now a shift from austerity to structural reforms, he reiterates.... There\u2019s some relief in the bond market: Q: Must the Greek government legislate any fresh measures before the mission teams will return? No, Dijsselbloem replies, the institutions will now return to Athens. They will talk to the Greek authorities about the specifics of tax reforms, pension reforms, the labour markets, etc. Once the two sides have reached an agreement, those measures will have to be legislated before Greece gets its next tranche of bailout funds, though. Q: The Greek government has just told us that they won\u2019t take one euro of extra austerity, so how can they stick to today\u2019s agreement? Dijsselbloem says that both sides are looking to change the focus of the Greek bailout programme, away from austerity and towards structural reforms. Those reforms could create \u2018fiscal space\u2019, which Greece could then use to fund growth-enhancing measures. Onto questions... Q: Who gave ground today to allow the teams from Greece\u2019s creditors to return to Athens? Dijsselbloem explains that both sides have agreed to resume talks on various reforms, including the labour market -- and issues like collective wage bargaining. If a staff level agreement can be reached, then there can be political agreement...and then creditors can also look at the issue of \u201cmedium term debt relief\u201d for Greece. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici tells the press conference in Brussels that both sides are committed to reaching an agreement on new fiscal measures. Today\u2019s agreement is an important step, he insists. Some instant reaction to the Greek breakthrough, starting with Slovakia\u2019s finance minister: Here\u2019s AP\u2019s Derek Gatopoulos: Teneo Intelligence\u2019s Wolf Piccoli isn\u2019t too impressed: It\u2019s Official! Greece\u2019s creditors are heading back to the capital, to discuss a new package of measures to ensure it is keeping up with its bailout requirements. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that enough progress has been made for officials to return to Athens \u201cin the very short term\u201d. They will work with the Greek authorities on a new package of reforms, including tax reforms and labour market regulation. The policy mix will change - away from austerity, and with a stronger emphasis on deeper reforms, Dijsselbloem adds. Once the package has been agreed, the Eurogroup will then consider whether it is sufficient to unlock Greece\u2019s next bailout payment. Dijsselbloem adds that there is no liquidity issue with Greece, but there is a sense of urgency to get a breakthrough before confidence is affected. And we\u2019re off.... Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem starts by apologising for the early finish of today\u2019s meeting, and jokes that many reporters will consequently miss this press conference. He says that the eurozone economy continues to improve, with growth picking up and unemployment falling. Greece\u2019s government is claiming victory, arguing that today\u2019s agreement won\u2019t mean additional austerity..... The latest from Brussels.... Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith has the details of today\u2019s deal -- Athens is agreeing to legislate for further fiscal reforms that might kick in, if required, in 2019. Greek bond yields are rising in value, following these reports that a deal has been hammered out to allow creditors to return to Athens for fresh talks. In a rare and unexpected development, today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting has ended ahead of schedule! Hopefully we\u2019ll hear what\u2019s been agreed soon..... German MEP Markus Ferber has fired a warning shot at Athens, by issuing a statement urging the Greek government to step up the implementation of its bailout programme. Ferber says: \u201cI expect a clear signal by the Eurogroup today. It is not the time for new compromises, new concessions or even debt relief. We have seen a lot of this in the past and preciously little has changed. Now it is time for the Greek government to deliver. There is a very long to-do list for the Greek government to start working on. Otherwise, the money supply must be shut off. Upping the pressure is first of all a question of credibility, but would also send the signal to the International Monetary Fund that the Eurogroup means business and wants the IMF to stay on board.\u201d While we wait for a press conference in Brussels, here\u2019s some photos from today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting: Further confirmation of a mini-breakthrough in Brussels: Greek journalist Ioannis Antypas has also heard that Greece and its lenders have made enough progress to allow talks to resume in Athens: Well-placed sources in Athens in contact with officials in Brussels are reporting that there has been a \u201cconvergence of views\u201d - enough to allow auditors to return to the Greek capital and continue the bailout review. But senior members in the ruling leftwing Syriza party are insisting that whatever compromise is found will have to be \u201chonourable\u201d so that it is endorsed by the party\u2019s central committee and parliamentary group. Senior cadres and MEPs are not ruling out political turbulence with some MPS standing down in protest over the additional measures creditors say Greece will have to implement for the review to be wrapped up. \u201cThe previous government should have been left to do the dirty work which Syriza was later asked to do,\u201d Syriza MEP Stelios Koulouglou told the Guardian, adding: \u201cWhatever will be agreed will be a bad deal which [prime minister Alexis] Tsipras will have to sell to Syriza and to the Greek public.\u201d You can (usually) rely on European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici to take an optimistic view of events.... Here we go! Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has arrived at today\u2019s meeting. Dijsselbloem tells the assembled press pack that ministers will discuss whether to sent their officials back to Athens to resume negotiations over the bailout programme. He says that he wants to conclude the review soon, but the issues are complex. Dijsselbloem also argues that there\u2019s no urgency to hand Greece more money (its next debt repayments are in July). That\u2019s another hint that we probably won\u2019t get a breakthrough today. AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp has more details: Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble has told reporters outside today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting that he doesn\u2019t expect a breakthrough over Greece\u2019s bailout today. But he\u2019s still confident that the two sides will agree what further reforms Athens must take, in time. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, has warned against allowing Greece\u2019s bailout problems to overshadow this year\u2019s elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands. But he\u2019s also not willing to wave through debt relief for Athens, just to get the issue out of the headlines. Here\u2019s the details, hot off Twitter. Eurozone finance ministers are arriving in Brussels for this afternoon\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Bloomberg reports that Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been talking about Britain\u2019s exit from the EU: Maybe he\u2019s seen today\u2019s story in the Guardian, about how European politicians are unhappy with Britain\u2019s approach to negotiations: Bon Dieu! French government bonds are suffering a nasty selloff as Marine Le Pen wins more support ahead of this spring\u2019s presidential elections. New opinion polls show the Front National candidate would win 42% of the vote if she faced centrist Emmanuel Macron in a two-way run-off for the presidency, and 44% against right-winger Francois Fillon. This indicates that the gap is narrowing, raising the chances that the nationalist, anti-euro Le Pen wins power. So the gap between French and German borrowing costs is now at its widest since summer 2012, as eurozone break-up fears ripple through the markets again. Over in Downing Street, Theresa May\u2019s spokesman has insisted that she didn\u2019t influence Kraft\u2019s decision to withdraw its offer for Unilever. Asked about the deal at the regular lobby briefing, he said: \u201cI think the issue of the withdrawal from the Unilever deal by Kraft is an issue you should put to Kraft. Number 10 wasn\u2019t involved in it. \u201cThe simple fact is that the bid has been withdrawn so I don\u2019t have a view on a bid that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d It emerged over the weekend that May had instructed officials to look into the deal, and the PM will probably be relieved that the deal has gone away. With Brexit negotiations starting soon, the government doesn\u2019t also want a row over the future of one of Britain\u2019s major employers, whose products are used by millions of people each day. Germany is also downplaying expectations ahead of today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting on Greece: Over in Greece, officials are warning that it will require a miracle for a breakthrough to be reached at the Eurogoup of euro area finance ministers this afternoon. With the exception of Eurogroup head, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is pushing for a solution before Dutch elections next month, there is almost no one who believes much more than the \u201cframework of an agreement\u201d can be reached today. One insider tells us: \u201cWe are really looking towards the German chancellor\u2019s meeting with [IMF chief Christine] Lagarde on Wednesday,\u201d. With EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker also attending the talks in Berlin, the hope was that a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d could be clinched to break the impasse, he said, adding. \u201cBar a miracle there won\u2019t be a solution today.\u201d Athens is interpreting emollient remarks by Germany\u2019s hardline finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, last night, as a good sign. In an interview with ARD television, Sch\u00e4uble rejected accusations that his preference was for Greece to leave the euro. \u201cI never made any [\u2019Grexit\u2019] threats...I\u2019m confident that Greece is on the right path.\u201d Negotiations will continue \u201cuntil the moment the Eurogroup starts,\u201d Greek officials say. But in the meantime, nervous investors are selling Greek two-year debt - sending the interest rate on the bonds up to an eight-month high... Just in: UK factories are enjoying a surge in demand, driving order books to their highest level in two years. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s monthly healthcheck, which suggests that British manufacturing continues to shrug off the shock of last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. Some 27% of businesses reported total orders to be above normal and 19% said orders were below normal, giving a balance of +8%, the highest since February 2015. But...the survey also found that the weak pound is driving up import costs. Around 38% of companies now expect to raise prices and 6% expecting to cut prices, giving a balance of +32% - the highest since April 2011. The pound has begun the week on the front foot, gaining half a cent against the US dollar to 1.246. But it\u2019s still almost 10% weaker than 12 months ago, when David Cameron announced the date of the EU referendum. The cost of insuring Unilever\u2019s debt against default has also dropped sharply today. That shows that bondholders are relieved that the threat of a Kraft Heinz takeover has faded away. Unilever\u2019s bonds had suffered a big selloff on Friday, on fears that the company might be downgraded if the deal went through. The company has a much better credit rating than its US rival (A1, five notches higher than Kraft\u2019s Baa3). Heads-up: Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem will speak to the press around 1.45pm GMT. Expect a few questions about the Greek bailout (see opening post for details). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has also noted that Unilever\u2019s shares are still higher than before Kraft Heinz\u2019s bid became public. That suggests City investors are expecting further action, even though Kraft Heinz has now sloped off. While this bid appears to have fallen at the first fence it undoubtedly keeps the focus on a sector that could see further consolidation. Bloomberg\u2019s Paul Dobson also sounds sceptical that this story is really over. The slump in the pound since the Brexit vote has made British firms an attractive asset. But Mike Grayer, partner and head of corporate finance at accountancy firm Menzies LLP, reckons that big UK firms can repel overseas suiters if they want. \u201cThere has been some speculation about whether the takeover offer by Kraft Heinz was motivated by the weak value of the pound but in my opinion this is unlikely to be the case. The continued buoyancy of UK equity markets is negating the effect of the dollar / pound exchange rate and is likely to keep opportunistic multinationals at bay. It is more likely that this proposed deal was motivated by a straightforward desire to consolidate and drive economies of scale. \u201cWhile UK plc is well placed to fight off unwanted takeover attention from overseas, SMEs may wish to take advantage of the exit opportunities that current market conditions are generating.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Unilever is dragging the London stock market back this morning. The FTSE 100 has dipped into the red, down 2 points, despite Royal Bank of Scotland surging by 6% to its highest level since the EU referendum. RBS shareholders are cheering a government plan to spare it selling off 300 branches. Unilever isn\u2019t the only company having a bad morning in the City. Bovis Homes, the housebuilder, has also slumped by over 7% this morning after it set aside \u00a37m to fix problems with newly built homes. The move follows a storm of complaints from angry customers whose houses weren\u2019t up to scratch, due to ropey tiling, shoddy plumbing or dodgy kitchen fitting. Acting CEO Earl Sibley says fixing customers\u2019 homes is an \u201cabsolute operational priority\u201d; he\u2019s already been touring Bovis properties to apologise to customers. More here: Unilever\u2019s CEO, Paul Polman, is known for earnest lectures about the importance of ethics and responsible capitalism, but he\u2019s proved that he can also roll his sleeves when required. Reuters\u2019 Kate Holton explains: Backed by Warren Buffett and the private equity firm 3G, Kraft had wanted to buy Unilever to build a global consumer goods giant but its offer was flatly rejected on Friday by the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap. According to people familiar with the matter, Kraft had not expected to encounter the resistance it received from Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman, who dismissed the offer as having no financial or strategic merit. Unilever\u2019s market capitalisation has now dropped back to \u00a3106bn, having hit a record high of \u00a3114bn on Friday. One for City chartists out there.... Unilever\u2019s shares are now on track for their worst day in over 13 years, Reuters says. They\u2019ve slumped to around \u00a335 per share, down from \u00a338 on Friday evening. That\u2019s bad news for investors who piled into the stock after Kraft revealed its approach, worth \u00a340 per share, around noon on Friday. But even so....they\u2019re still rather higher than last Thursday - when you could get a Unilever share for \u00a333.50. Bloomberg reporter Thomas Buckley suspects Warren Buffett didn\u2019t fancy a bruising hostile takeover battle for Unilever: The political backlash against Kraft Heinz\u2019 approach for Unilever also helped to doom the bid. Former business secretary Vince Cable let the charge. He urged prime minister Theresa May to block the approach, and deliver on her pledge to fight predatory takeovers. Kathleen Brooks of City Index believes this was a significant factor: We expect the chief reason to drop the bid was concern about the political atmosphere in Britain, which is currently against foreigners making bids for \u201cnational treasures\u201d, even half-Dutch ones like Unilever. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, reckons the bid collapsed because that Warren Buffet (Kraft Heinz\u2019s biggest shareholder) wouldn\u2019t put his hand deeper into his pocket. Salmon says: \u201cAfter the news broke that Kraft were in the frame for a takeover on Friday, Unilever\u2019s initial reaction was frosty to say the least. However, Kraft was clearly hopeful of working towards a deal. With the shares settling around half way between a realistic second offer price and where they traded before the news broke, the deal going through was far from a formality. However, it is still surprising to see it shelved just one business day after the initial news broke. The deal was set to top \u00a3100bn, so the size premium would always have been a consideration- especially since Warren Buffett, one of the biggest names behind the bid, hardly has a reputation for paying anything other than the price he sees fit. What exactly happened in this whirlwind of a story is yet to be fully revealed, but it looks like Unilever isn\u2019t just playing hard to get. It was always going to be a difficult pitch to convince shareholders to relinquish their grip on Unilever, given the expectations for the company to keep churning out resilient growth in the years to come.\u201d Why did Kraft Heinz walk away so fast? One reason is that it simply wasn\u2019t offering enough for Unilever. Louise Kernohan of Aberdeen Asset Management (a Unilever shareholder) told Bloomberg TV that Kraft Heinz\u2019s approach was a big surprise, but she didn\u2019t think it would work. Kraft Heinz was only offering to pay around 18% above Unilever\u2019s market value - that\u2019s not enough to tempt long-term shareholders who are looking for \u201cdouble-digit returns in perpetuity\u201d, Kernohan explained. A weekend is a long time in dealmaking. Shares in Unilever have plunged by over 7% at the start of trading, after Kraft Heinz announced that it was abandoning its attempts to merge with its Anglo Dutch rival. That wipes out some, but not all, of the 13.5% surge on Friday after Kraft Heinz revealed it had approached Unilever with an offer worth \u00a3115bn. Some investors had expected a classic takeover battle, potentially leading to the creation of a packaged foods and household items titan. But instead Kraft Heinz has thrown in the towel with surprising speed, following a rather negative reaction to its approach (Unilever insisted that the offer, at \u00a340 per share, was far too low). The two sides now say that \u201chold each other in high regard\u201d, in a joint statement confirming the approach is toast. It appears that Kraft Heinz has received an unexpectedly cool response from Unilever shareholders, who agreed that the proposal lacked merit. The US company may also have been spooked by the political reaction, with some politicians remembering its takeover of chocolate firm Cadbury in 2010. The collapse of talks will reassure workers, as unions had feared hefty job cuts if the two companies had joined forces. I\u2019ll pull together more reaction now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... Greece\u2019s bailout woes are back on the agenda today, as Eurozone finance ministers are head to Brussels for a crunch meeting. The Eurogroup will hope to make progress towards breaking the deadlock between Athens and her creditors, who can\u2019t agree what measures Greece must take to hit its bailout targets. A few weeks ago, there had been hopes of a big breakthrough at this meeting, that would unlock \u20ac7bn of aid loans. But this now seems highly unlikely, meaning Greece\u2019s problems will now overshadow elections in the Netherlands and France this spring. If Greece doesn\u2019t get this \u20ac7bn by July, it may be unable to repay loans to the European Central Bank - triggering another debt crisis, and possibly even a fourth rescue package. As Nick Kounis of ABN Amro Bank puts it: \u201cDelays in completing the review raise the risk of another bailout being needed.\u201d The situation looks pretty murky right now. For months, the two sides have been split over tax rises, labour market reforms and pensions. And overshadowing everything is the International Monetary Fund, which insists that Greece needs substantial debt relief. Greece wants the IMF to stop demanding pension reforms. Germany insists that the IMF takes part in the Greek bailout - but doesn\u2019t accept that Athens needs debt relief. And round and round we go..... The Eurogroup meeting starts around 1pm GMT, with a press conference scheduled for 5.30pm GMT.

      "bodyText": "One of the world\u2019s largest sailing yachts has been impounded in Gibraltar over claims that its billionaire Russian owner owes the shipbuilder \u20ac15.3m (\u00a313.3m). The Gibraltar Port Authority impounded the \u20ac400m \u201cSailing Yacht A\u201d as it was on its way to be delivered to industrialist Andrey Melnichenko, following a legal filing from the German shipbuilder that constructed the futuristic-looking vessel. The 143m-long Bermuda-registered yacht, which has three masts taller than Big Ben\u2019s clock tower, left the Kiel shipyard of superyacht builder Nobiskrug two weeks ago to conduct final sea trials before being handed over to Melnichenko. But on Wednesday two Gibraltarian \u201cship keepers\u201d took control of the Philippe Starck designed yacht, which is longer than 13 London buses and features a helipad, onboard swimming pool, and underwater observation pod. Gibraltar Admiralty marshal Liam Yeats, said: \u201cThe vessel is under arrest and is currently at anchor in British Gibraltar Territorial Waters.\u201d \u201cIn the volatile world of shipping, particularly in the recent economic downturn, disputes and defaults are an unfortunate fact of life,\u201d the Gibraltar Port Authority says on its website. \u201c[Ship arrest] isn\u2019t an attractive proposition, and clearly it\u2019s an action of last resort but, when handled efficiently and swiftly, it can at least deliver a safe resolution to a dispute and bring matters to a close.\u201d Court papers show Nobiskrug is seeking an outstanding payment of \u20ac9.8m, as well as \u20ac5.5m for subcontractors and interest charges. The claims are made against Valla Yachts Ltd, the Bermuda company to which the yacht is registered. These are disputed costs in arbitration. Relations between Melnichenko and the shipbuilders appears to have soured rapidly since the ship left the Nobiskrug yard. Upon its debut the shipbuilder\u2019s managing director, Holger Kahl, said: \u201cBorn from the desire of the owner to \u2018push the boundaries of engineering and challenge the status quo of the industry\u2019, Sailing Yacht A is undoubtedly one of the most visionary projects Nobiskrug has ever been involved in.\u201d A spokesman for Melnichenko, who controls a $13.2bn fertiliser and coal fortune, said the shipbuilder\u2019s decision to file court papers for the yacht to be impounded was \u201can astounding act for a shipbuilder of Nobiskrug\u2019s standing\u201d. \u201cThe facts are that with a project of this magnitude there are sometimes outstanding issues to be resolved,\u201d the spokesman told YachtHarbour.com. \u201cWe assumed the matter was progressing to a resolution as Nobiskrug were happy to release the yacht on 5 February to the owner\u2019s project team for further works to be carried out in Spain. The money was paid by the owner the following day into an escrow account pending a resolution of the discussions. All monies now being claimed are in arbitration and we understand these disputes fall under arbitration in the UK courts.\u201d The spokesman later said \u201ca technical problem\u201d was being resolved and said the ship would be released in a few days and the \u201cunpleasant episode\u201d would be over. As the vessel made its way to Spain earlier this month, Melnichenko\u2019s project director, Dirk Kloosterman, who also helped build Larry Ellison\u2019s Rising Sun and Melnichenko\u2019s previous superyacht \u201cMotor Yacht A\u201d, said: \u201cThis has been the most challenging assignment of my career. I am confident Sailing Yacht A will be the world\u2019s greatest yacht in terms of design and technology for the years ahead. \u201cHer beauty is breathtaking, and Philippe Starck\u2019s astonishing design and ultimate vision will be the subject of many conversations wherever she travels around the globe. We look forward to the final delivery to the owner.\u201d Melnichenko is said to have chosen to name his yachts \u201cA\u201d so that they appear first in shipping registers. Sailing Yacht A, which requires 54 crew to operate, has eight decks connected by several lifts, and is capable of achieving speeds of 35 knots downwind. The unique carbon fibre masts can withstand 90 knots of wind with full sail up, the equivalent to a category 2 hurricane or hanging two double-decker buses from each tip. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 March 2017 to clarify that the outstanding payment was disputed costs in arbitration. An earlier version of the article incorrectly described the boat as the world\u2019s largest sailing yacht.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers fear the rising cost of raw materials will soon dent a robust recovery since the Brexit vote that has included total orders hitting a two-year high. A survey of the sector found suggested that concerns over inflation were at their highest level for six years as firms said the weak pound was increasing the cost of imports, forcing them to raise prices or accept a severe squeeze on profits. Export orders also fell slightly, though remained well above the long-run average as manufacturers continued to benefit from the flipside of the devaluation in sterling. The CBI, which conducted the survey, said stronger demand and higher production showed the manufacturing industry remained in rude health. But it warned the chancellor, Philip Hammond, that the government would need to step in to alleviate rising cost pressures to prevent a reversal of fortunes. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cWith cost pressures building, businesses will be looking to the budget for relief from business rates, specifically bringing forward the adjustment from retail prices index (RPI) to the consumer prices index (CPI). \u201cOver the longer term, investment in education and innovation as part of the government\u2019s industrial strategy will really need to deliver in the face of increasing political headwinds.\u201d Hammond will unveil his first budget on 8 March with businesses becoming increasingly concerned about rising business rates and the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union. He is expected to resist calls for him to intervene to lower business costs while industry remains buoyant and employment is at an all-time high. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the CBI\u2019s industrial trends survey added to the evidence that the manufacturing sector was getting back on its feet. The headline total orders balance picked up from +5 in January to +8 in February, its highest level since February 2015 and well above its long-run average of -19, while the export orders balance fell from -9 to -10 in February to remain well above its long-run average of -20. Gregory said: \u201cAdmittedly, the drop in the pound is having a clear impact on price pressures, with the price expectations balance rising to its highest in nearly six years. \u201cBut the sector looks on course to provide a positive contribution to GDP growth in the first quarter. And with manufacturing exports set to benefit from the fall in sterling and solid demand from abroad, the future looks more promising for manufacturing activity than it has done for some time.\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, was more gloomy, arguing that manufacturers were failing to capitalise fully on the lower pound and relying on domestic orders. \u201cIt remains difficult to see how domestic demand will maintain its momentum when producers push through even bigger price rises,\u201d he said. \u201cThe percentage of producers reporting that they will raise prices over the next three months rose to +32 in February \u2013 its highest level since April 2011. The balance is consistent with producer output price inflation picking up to about 6% soon, from 3.5% in January. \u201cThe recent slowdown in household income growth, in response to flat employment and weakening wage growth, suggests consumers will have to cut back later this year when prices rise sharply. Accordingly, we continue to expect the manufacturing revival to lose considerable pace later this year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Bovis Homes is to pay \u00a37m to repair poorly built new homes sold to customers, raising fresh questions about the standards of new-build properties across the country and the regulation of the market. The company \u2013 one of the biggest housebuilders builders in Britain \u2013 will pay compensation after angry customers formed a Facebook group accusing Bovis of pressuring them to move in to incomplete houses so it could hit sales targets. The boss of Bovis apologised to customers on Monday for the poor quality of their houses and promised to finish them \u201cto their satisfaction\u201d. He refused to state how many homes needed the urgent repair work, or how much it will cost to fix each house. The company also refused to say which developments were worst affected, but it is understood that many of the problem homes are in Kent. The announcement led to more than \u00a3100m being wiped off the stock market value of Bovis, with its shares falling 10% to 757p. The news comes amid growing complaints about the quality of new homes and the organisation that sets the standards for new-build properties. Critics claim NHBC , which provides 10-year warranties for most new homes in Britain, is failing to protect consumers. Another recent controversy over new homes has seen Britain\u2019s largest housing association, Clarion Housing Group, agree to buy back some properties on a housing development in the east London borough of Havering. Oliver Colvile, the Conservative MP who chairs an all-party parliamentary group on new builds, called for an independent ombudsman to hold housebuilders to account. \u201cA lot of developments across the country are not very good, and I\u2019m concerned about all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a genuine need for more housing but we need to ensure they are going to be good quality housing rather than the sometimes frankly rubbish. \u201cBuying a house is the biggest financial investment families are going to make. It is their dream and suddenly they find out it is not fit for purpose.\u201d Paula Higgins, chief executive of the Homeowners Alliance campaign group, said buying a new homes is \u201criskier than buying a home that has been standing for 100 years\u201d. She added: \u201cPeople are going in with their eyes shut because they think they are getting the same protection as other big purchases. There need to be alot more consumer protection. \u201c[The Bovis homes] were signed off for the needs of the shareholder, not for the needs of the homeowner.\u201d Earl Sibley, Bovis\u2019s interim chief executive, announced the \u00a37m \u201ccustomer care provision\u201d as homeowners prepare to protest at the company\u2019s annual meeting in May. Sibley, who stepped in after Dave Ritchie quit after a profits warning last month, said he would make fixing customers homes the \u201cabsolute operational priority\u201d. He said the company had experienced a much higher number of \u201csnagging issues\u201d on new homes than it would normally expect and had conducted a \u201cthorough and detailed review\u201d. He admitted that the company\u2019s customer service \u201cfell materially short\u201d and had been \u201cdeclining for some time\u201d. Sibley promised to conduct an \u201cend-to-end review\u201d of the company\u2019s whole production process, and has launched a \u201ccustomer service task force\u201d to urgently fix faulty homes. Sibley declined to comment when asked if Ritchie\u2019s exit from the company after 18 years concerned the shoddily built homes. The affected customers have been left nursing problems such as faulty plumbing, no guttering, and half-finished tiling. Rob Elmes said he was offered \u00a33,000 if he and his wife completed on 23 December, but declined the offer because of the defects with their \u00a3320,000 three-bedroom property in Inkberrow, Worcestershire. Helen Batt said her \u00a3389,995 Bovis home in Maidstone, Kent, had no turf in the back garden, the wrong kitchen units and had not been carpeted. More than 1,400 have joined the Bovis Homes Victims Group on Facebook while others have posted a series of videos showing their poorly built homes on YouTube. Marc Holden, spokesman for the campaign, said he had never expected the Facebook campaign to have any effect but now speaks regularly directly with Sibley and is helping advise the company on how to improve customer service. \u201cI was quite cynical that little old me and our Facebook group trying to fight a big company would have any effect, but they actually have changed,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cWell, the proof will be in the pudding. But I do believe they are genuinely trying to change.\u201d Holden, who spent \u00a3490,000 on his home in Milton Keynes, said there were more than 100 faults identified in his house, many of which have still not been fixed almost a year after he moved in. \u201cIt was a nightmare, I don\u2019t see how it could have got worse,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I guess it has to get bad before someone gets a kick up the arse to do something.\u201d Sibley said he had personally visited several customers\u2019 homes to survey the problems and apologise in person and was \u201cworking with them individually\u201d to fix the issues unique to their homes. He was unable to provide a figure for the average cost to fix the homes, or identify the bill for the worst-built home. \u201cOur customer service proposition has failed to ensure that all of our customers receive the expected high standard of care,\u201d Sibley said. \u201cWe are fully committed to putting our customers back at the centre of everything we do and to delivering a much improved level of customer service.\u201d Some customers will be paid back for urgent work that they have already paid for, and several will be paid compensation on top of the cost of the remedial repairs. The cost of compensating customers knocked Bovis\u2019s full-year profits, which fell 3% to \u00a3154.7m, below analysts expectations of \u00a3160m to170m. The company said its profits would fall again next year as it would reduce the number of units it builds by 10-15%. Bovis built almost 4,000 homes last year, but said 180 properties that should have been completed in 2016 had yet to be handed over to buyers.",

      "bodyText": "Asking prices in Britain\u2019s housing market rose at the slowest annual rate in almost four years in February as buyers become wary about paying too much, according to the latest survey from Rightmove. Annual price growth fell from 3.2% in January to 2.3%, the weakest since April 2013. On a monthly basis, average asking prices rose 2% t0 \u00a3306,213, the slowest rate of growth in the month of February in eight years. Miles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market analyst, said sellers would be taking a risk by overpricing their properties. He said a number of factors were making buyers more cautious, including inflation, which hit a two-year high of 1.8% in January and is expected to reach about 3% in early 2018, putting more pressure on household finances. \u201cProperty prices are still 2.3% higher than a year ago, but perhaps we\u2019re approaching the territory where many buyers are unable or unwilling to pay what sellers are asking, given the negative combination of rises in the cost of living, tighter lending criteria and a dose of Brexit uncertainty.\u201d Rightmove said the housing market was boosted in early 2016 by \u201cfrenzied\u201d buy-to-let investors who rushed to complete transactions before new stamp duty rules were introduced in April, making this year look subdued by comparison. However, it added that demand was holding up, with more than 131m visits to its website in January, up 3% compared with a year earlier. \u201cWhile seller pricing power appears to be on the wane overall, the numbers of deals done is very robust, scarcely lower than during last year\u2019s tax-saving rush,\u201d Shipside said. Estate agents reported that buyer interest was significantly diminished if properties were priced more than 5% too high. Rightmove analysed more than 100,000 newly listed homes and found that sellers were 40% more likely to sell with that agent if the property was correctly priced when it first came to market. Kevin Shaw, national sales director at estate agency Leaders, said: \u201cTempting as it may be, it\u2019s never in the interests of a seller to set an asking price above what a property is really worth. Setting an accurate price, based on local market conditions, is crucial for achieving both a quick sale and the best possible price. \u201cOverpricing, particularly in a price-sensitive market, will result in the property sitting on the market until the price is dropped, losing the interest of buyers and ultimately achieving a lower price in the end.\u201d Brian Murphy, head of lending for the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said the report suggested buyers were sticking to their budgets with very little \u201cwiggle room\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that this is due to stricter lending criteria, and suggests that buyers are getting their ducks in a row financially before they start their property search, in terms of applying for their mortgage, to understand how much they can spend,\u201d he said. This meant that agents were finding it harder to \u201cupsell\u201d properties by encouraging buyers to look at properties that were out of their price range. Changes in asking price varied widely in London, according to Rightmove. The biggest annual riser was the borough of Camden, where average prices jumped 27.3% to \u00a31.4m over the year to February. The worst performing area in the capital was Kensington and Chelsea, where average prices were \u00a32.1m in February, down 14.6% compared with a year earlier.",

On a monthly basis, average asking prices rose 2% t0 \u00a3306,213, the slowest rate of growth in the month of February in eight years.</p> <p>Miles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market analyst, said sellers would be taking a risk by overpricing their properties.</p> <p>He said a number of factors were making buyers more cautious, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/14/uk-inflation-rises-to-18-spurred-by-weak-pound-and-rising-fuel-costs\">inflation, which hit a two-year high of 1.8% in January</a> and is expected to reach about 3% in early 2018, putting more pressure on household finances.</p> <p>\u201cProperty prices are still 2.3% higher than a year ago, but perhaps we\u2019re approaching the territory where many buyers are unable or unwilling to pay what sellers are asking, given the negative combination of rises in the cost of living, tighter lending criteria and a dose of Brexit uncertainty.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/11/we-didnt-even-have-room-for-a-table-meet-the-30-somethings-fleeing-london\">\u2018We didn't even have room for a table\u2019: meet the 30-somethings fleeing London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rightmove said the housing market was boosted in early 2016 by \u201cfrenzied\u201d buy-to-let investors who rushed to complete transactions before new stamp duty rules were introduced in April, making this year look subdued by comparison. </p> <p>However, it added that demand was holding up, with more than 131m visits to its website in January, up 3% compared with a year earlier. </p> <p>\u201cWhile seller pricing power appears to be on the wane overall, the numbers of deals done is very robust, scarcely lower than during last year\u2019s tax-saving rush,\u201d Shipside said.</p> <p>Estate agents reported that buyer interest was significantly diminished if properties were priced more than 5% too high.</p> <p>Rightmove analysed more than 100,000 newly listed homes and found that sellers were 40% more likely to sell with that agent if the property was correctly priced when it first came to market.</p> <p>Kevin Shaw, national sales director at estate agency Leaders, said: \u201cTempting as it may be, it\u2019s never in the interests of a seller to set an asking price above what a property is really worth. Setting an accurate price, based on local market conditions, is crucial for achieving both a quick sale and the best possible price. </p> <p>\u201cOverpricing, particularly in a price-sensitive market, will result in the property sitting on the market until the price is dropped, losing the interest of buyers and ultimately achieving a lower price in the end.\u201d </p> <p>Brian Murphy, head of lending for the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said the report suggested buyers were sticking to their budgets with very little \u201cwiggle room\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s likely that this is due to stricter lending criteria, and suggests that buyers are getting their ducks in a row financially before they start their property search, in terms of applying for their mortgage, to understand how much they can spend,\u201d he said. This meant that agents were finding it harder to \u201cupsell\u201d properties by encouraging buyers to look at properties that were out of their price range. </p> <p>Changes in asking price varied widely in London, according to Rightmove. The biggest annual riser was the borough of Camden, where average prices jumped 27.3% to \u00a31.4m over the year to February. </p> <p>The worst performing area in the capital was Kensington and Chelsea, where average prices were \u00a32.1m in February, down 14.6% compared with a year earlier.</p>",
