      "bodyText": "Energy companies guilty of overcharging households will be forced to compensate consumers by a beefed-up industry watchdog under government proposals to be published this week. Ofgem will be given enhanced powers in line with its regulatory peers and will be able to demand limitless compensation for misdemeanours such as mis-selling or mishandling customer complaints. Under the current regime, Ofgem can fine energy businesses up to 10% of their turnover for licence breaches, but the payment goes into government coffers instead of customers' pockets. The energy secretary, Edward Davey, said: \"I want to make sure that consumers are protected and that the independent energy regulator has the powers it needs.\" He added: \"We are now looking at beefing up Ofgem's powers further so that should the need arise it can make companies compensate consumers directly, rather than necessarily having to rely on a voluntary approach.\" Ofgem will also retain the \"effective deterrent\" of imposing fines on misbehaving utilities, the government added. The proposals will be unveiled in a consultation launched by the Department of Energy and Climate Change on Tuesday. If they are approved they could be included in the energy bill, which will be published later this year. Last month EDF Energy, one of the \"big six\" utilities that dominates the UK market, agreed to pay \u00a34.5m to vulnerable customers after Ofgem found that it had made misleading sales claims. About 70,000 vulnerable households will receive refunds of nearly \u00a350 each. However, a statement released by Ofgem at the time confirmed that EDF had \"offered\" to pay the compensation, whereas under this week's proposals, the regulator would be able to impose the repayments. Other big six players have suffered adverse Ofgem rulings over the past year, with npower fined \u00a32m in November 2011 for mishandling customer complaints, months after British Gas was docked \u00a32.5m for the same offence. Consumer groups welcomed the proposals. Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, said: \"Customers who have felt the detriment caused by energy firms' mistakes should also feel the benefit of any fine the firm faces. Money should be going back into consumers' pockets when they have lost out \u2013 not into the Treasury's coffers, as is the case with fines now.\" Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said Ofgem deserved to be given the same powers as its regulatory peers. \"It has a duty to protect consumers and should be able to force suppliers to provide redress for customers, as other regulators do,\" he said. Gillian Guy, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: \"It is absolutely right that consumers get redress, including money back in their pocket, when they have lost out because companies have not complied with the rules.\" He added that the enhanced regulatory regime should be brought in as \"soon as possible\" if it is endorsed by the consultation. The department said the compensation will not be capped, in line with powers wielded by the Financial Services Authority and Ofcom, the communications industries watchdog. \"A cap could mean that consumers would not get as much compensation as they should be entitled to,\" a spokesman said. Officials are also concerned that imposing a cap on compensation will allow utility companies to make a profit on licence breaches, because the benefit to the bottom line from mis-selling could outweigh redress to customers. As the EDF case shows, Ofgem has been successful in securing compensation in recent years and has overseen compensation payments of more than \u00a36m since 2007. Over the same period it has levied fines of more than \u00a318m. Sarah Harrison, Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement, said: \"These powers, which we have been seeking from government, would strengthen our ability to take more targeted action against companies that are found in breach of their licence.\" Mis-selling scandals have added to the pressure on energy companies over rising bills; the British Gas chief executive, Phil Bentley, warned last month that energy prices will climb for the next 10 years. Steep price rises by utility companies have seen average domestic gas and electricity bills rise by \u00a3183 over the past 12 months, leading to calls for tougher regulatory intervention. Last year EDF said the public, politicians and regulators had lost confidence in the energy industry and admitted that a competition commission inquiry might be needed to rebuild trust. According to uSwitch, the price comparison site, up to 4m households are in debt to their energy suppliers. Amid calculations that about a quarter of UK homes are in fuel poverty - defined as a household spending more than 10% of net income on heating their homes - energy companies are spending around \u00a32m on initiatives to help the poorest households. Christine McGourty, director of communications at Energy UK \u2013 the trade body representing the gas and electricity sector \u2013 said: \"The industry welcomes the opportunity to respond to the consultation and will actively engage with the energy regulator to see how these proposals will work in practice.\"",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook is close to striking a \u00a31.2bn refinancing deal that will give the troubled travel group two more years' breathing space to turn round its business. A consortium of 17 banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays is expected to approve an extension of loans until 2015. Although the conditions are likely to be stringent, with higher interest rates and the lenders taking a significant stake in the company, the deal is regarded as good news by Thomas Cook. Without the backing of the banks, it would have had to repay the bulk of its debt by April 2013. Britain's oldest and best-known tour operator appeared to be on the brink of collapse before Christmas after a disastrous year that featured three profit warnings and the departure of its long-serving chief executive. Despite \u00a3100m of short-term funding having been secured in autumn 2011, an emergency loan of \u00a3200m was needed by late November to keep the firm afloat. Bookings slumped in subsequent months as reports of its financial woes deterred customers. The new arrangement negotiated by the interim chief executive, Sam Weihagen, is likely to be followed by further asset sales to help pay off the debt of the 170-year-old firm, which has an annual turnover of \u00a39bn and 30,000 employees. Last year it sold off its Spanish hotel chain to Iberostar and it is looking to sell its Indian division entirely, although Weihagen has said he would take only a \"compelling offer\" for the growing Indian holiday business. Its fleet of planes may also be sold and leased back. Another asset that could be sold is its stake in Nats, the air traffic controller. The shareholding is part-owned with six other airlines in the Airlines Group, which is considering whether to sell its investment. The firm is also axing 200 of its 1,300 UK high-street stores. Thomas Cook shares tumbled by more than 75% to less than 10p on one tumultuous day in November last year, but have since recovered to 20.5p. It recently announced a 2% fall in summer bookings in Britain, but said a new \"Wonderful World\" advertising campaign had brought in new business, while improvements to its websites had meant a 19% increase in online bookings in recent weeks. In a statement last month, Weihagen said trading across the group was \"stable\" and in line with expectations. He said the outlook for the business remained challenging, with a major factor being lower consumer demand, and the French market in particular slumping. However, he said bookings across much of Europe had improved and summer trading was \"encouraging\". The company says it is now seeing British holidaymakers return to Tunisia after a drop in bookings since the Arab spring \u2013 although its German clientele have largely boycotted Greece since the Euro crisis and bailouts.",

      "bodyText": "Shareholders have increased pressure on Tesco to scrap its US ventures and pull out of banking with renewed calls for it to focus on rejuvenating its flagging UK retail business. At the start of a critical fortnight in which the chief executive, Phil Clarke, is to unveil his blueprint for the supermarket group's future, investors have reportedly spoken out against the \"disastrous\" transatlantic foray. A fund manager at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, Tesco's third largest shareholder with a 4% stake, said Tesco \"needs to think long and hard about what it wants to be\". L&amp;G's Richard Black told the Sunday Times: \"Can it be everything to everyone, or should it focus on its gem, the British grocery business? Of course, this is likely to raise questions about other areas of the business, such as America and the bank.\" Another institutional investor in Tesco, speaking anonymously, said the US Fresh &amp; Easy stores were a \"disaster\" and once the level of losses had become obvious, Tesco \"should have pulled back faster\". Fresh &amp; Easy has made trading losses of \u00a3500m on top of the \u00a3800m investment Tesco has made since its launch four years ago. The banking arm, struggling with IT problems, has yet to deliver promised current accounts. The supermarket giant issued its first profits warning for 20 years in January, and shares have fallen 21% over the past year. Tesco's market share is now at its lowest level for almost seven years, at just below 30%, although still some way ahead of its closest competitor, Asda. Shareholder concerns have been reported in the financial press, with one top investor saying it believes another profits warning could be on the way. January's news was stark enough to prompt the Invesco Perpetual fund, which was Tesco's fifth largest shareholder, to sell its entire stake. Tesco's annual results will be published next week on 18 April, at the same time as Clarke delivers results of his strategic review. Clarke, who took over from Sir Terry Leahy last year, is reported to be considering changes to sales promotions and to be looking at ways to create \"warmer\" stores, including deploying more staff to assist customers. Innovations tested at 200 selected stores are to be extended across Tesco's 2,800 UK stores. Last week Tesco announced it would be altering its Value brands to give a more upmarket look and healthier quality to the cheapest items on its shelves. Separately, Tesco's stores were criticised by rival Sainsbury's boss Justin King, who said that the main reason retailers struggle is that \"they stop doing a great job for customers\". He told the Sunday Telegraph that \"certain people have executed big shops in a way that customers don't like\". A Tesco spokesman said: \"We stay close to our investors and know what they expect from Tesco.\" He added that they had \"a clear target to break even in America\".",

      "body": "<p>Ferdinand \"Butzi\" Porsche, who has died aged 76, was the industrial designer responsible for the shape of the Porsche 911 sports car. He was the last member of the German engineering dynasty who&#xa0;could claim to have put pen to paper on a car design bearing the Porsche badge, although he effectively left automotive design in 1967.</p> <p>After 1972, following the public flotation of Porsche, all family members were banned from managerial positions in the company; from that point Butzi pursued a wider brief, creating expensive Porsche-branded pens, sunglasses and many other industrial and household objects.</p> <p>Ferdinand Alexander Porsche was born in Stuttgart, southern Germany. The eldest son of Dorothea and Ferry Porsche, he was named after his grandfather Ferdinand Porsche, the brilliant Austrian-born engineer who was already a household name for creating the Volkswagen \"people's car\" at the behest of Hitler.

      "bodyText": "Ferdinand \"Butzi\" Porsche, who has died aged 76, was the industrial designer responsible for the shape of the Porsche 911 sports car. He was the last member of the German engineering dynasty who could claim to have put pen to paper on a car design bearing the Porsche badge, although he effectively left automotive design in 1967. After 1972, following the public flotation of Porsche, all family members were banned from managerial positions in the company; from that point Butzi pursued a wider brief, creating expensive Porsche-branded pens, sunglasses and many other industrial and household objects. Ferdinand Alexander Porsche was born in Stuttgart, southern Germany. The eldest son of Dorothea and Ferry Porsche, he was named after his grandfather Ferdinand Porsche, the brilliant Austrian-born engineer who was already a household name for creating the Volkswagen \"people's car\" at the behest of Hitler. It was the military hardware the elder Ferdinand created for the Nazis that caused the French to jail him for two years after the second world war; the experience shortened his life (he died in 1952) but he survived long enough for Ferdinand Jr to know him and to understand the prestige of the engineering dynasty into which he had been born. In the late 40s, Butzi, or \"FA\", as he was known by family and close friends, was initiated into the world of engineering in his grandfather's workshops. At the time, momentum was gathering behind the notion of a rear-engined sports car based around VW components that would carry the Porsche badge and change a design consultancy (creating cars for other firms) into a marque in its own right. He had already shown an early acumen for design by making his own toys and would be the only one of his brothers to join the family business. By the time he was at secondary school in Switzerland in 1953, the Porsche 356 was already a commercial hit far exceeding his father's modest expectations. Butzi was being groomed to follow in the family engineering tradition. He completed an internship with the ignition specialists Robert Bosch before starting work in the Porsche technical design office in Zuffenhausen, a suburb of Stuttgart, on engine-building and prototype construction, having flunked his studies at the Ulm School of Design. By 1958 plans were already afoot for an upmarket six-cylinder successor to the decade-old 356 range. Butzi was given the task of creating a body style for this new \"Type 7\" car that would be roomier and sleeker than the already rather quaintly rotund 356. This Porsche car for the 60s had to maintain the ideals of elegant functionalism that had made the 356 a cult object among devoted fans within its own lifetime; it had to be compact and rear-engined, with nothing superfluous or distracting. It was a formidable task for a man still in his 20s, but the new Porsche 911, launched at the Frankfurt motor-show in 1963, exceeded expectations. It eclipsed its predecessor to become the car that would define everything the Porsche brand stands for. After nearly five decades, the basic outline that Butzi Porsche sculpted in clay is still with us, recently relaunched in its seventh generation but recognisably the same model. No other car currently in production is so instantly recognisable. At its launch, the new Porsche was known as the 901 until Peugeot complained, pointing out that they held the rights to all car names with a zero in the middle. Hence the 901 became the 911, a rear-engined coupe that simply refuses to be replaced, so loyal are its buyers. The exact details of how Butzi arrived at this classically simple shape have always been slightly unclear, feeding rumours that his contribution was less important than the Porsche PR department would have people believe. Certainly, the shape of the 911 was arrived at in collaboration with the company body engineer Erwin Komenda; it is also a matter of record that there were internal squabbles with Komenda over plans for a bigger, four-seater model that were scrapped by Ferry Porsche. Whatever the case, Butzi was made head of the Porsche design studio in 1962 and then was responsible for the 904 Carrera GTS, essentially a racing model, which he often stated was a favourite among his own creations because he was able to design it with very little outside interference. In 1968 he was made deputy managing director, but the family feeling within Porsche in the 60s could be corrosive. Butzi feuded with his cousin Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch and their bitter power struggles prompted Ferry Porsche to float the company and remove both men from the picture in 1972.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Easter is traditionally when the housing market comes out of hibernation \u2013 and if ever there were a time when it might be imagined activity would be buoyant, it would be this year. The Bank of England has pegged the official short-term interest rate at 0.5% for more than three years and is now part-way through a third round of asset purchases, which will in total boost the money supply by \u00a3325bn. For the past four decades, cheap credit has been the catalyst for property booms. That was the case in the early 1970s, when Threadneedle Street abandoned direct controls on lending and then watched helplessly as prices rose by 50% in 1973. A second bubble followed 15 years later as a result of a toxic mix of financial deregulation, cuts in interest rates and the pre-announced abolition of double mortgage relief. In the years leading up to the financial crisis of 2007, borrowers could secure loans at high multiples of their income with few questions asked. There will, however, be no housing boom this year. Transactions are running at half the level seen in the pre-crash period, and the pick-up in activity at the end of 2011 and in the early months of 2012 was linked to the end of special stamp duty arrangements for first-time buyers. The property market has been unusually quiet for the last couple of years, with a shortage of buyers, sellers sitting tight, and prices barely moving up or down. This trend looks likely to continue. There is no real evidence that the Bank's quantitative easing programme is leading to mortgages becoming more freely available, and potential first-time buyers are struggling to raise the deposits demanded by lenders before they will grant a loan. Prices need to come down to make residential property more affordable but that only tends to happen during periods of sharply rising unemployment, negative equity and aggressive foreclosure. That was the case in Britain during the early 1990s, and has been the reason for the big falls in house prices seen in the United States since 2007, but does not apply to the current UK property market. On the contrary, banks and building societies have adopted a lenient approach to those unfortunate borrowers in arrears with their mortgage payments and, as a result, repossessions are low. There are few forced sellers, so little pressure to cut prices to levels that would make them more affordable to first-time buyers. Anybody thinking of buying a home can take their time, because prices will, at best, move sideways this year and there is currently not the remotest chance of the Bank's monetary policy committee raising interest rates. All of which means this is the perfect time to take stock and to suggest reforms, should they be deemed necessary. It would tax even the most eloquent of advocates to make the case that 40 years of house-price inflation has been beneficial to the UK. It has certainly been good for the current crop of owner-occupiers in their 40s, 50s and 60s but not for the next generation, who are frozen out of the market by high prices. Since the early 1970s, UK house prices have tripled in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, with the biggest gainers those living in the south-east. Germany, courtesy of ultra-low interest rates, has seen house prices rise by 10% over the past two years, but this is the exception, not the rule. The cost of residential property has barely budged in real terms in the past 40 years and, as a result, the economy has been better balanced and has been less prone to the sort of debilitating boom-busts seen in the UK, which have caused extensive collateral damage to manufacturing. Britain's labour market mobility has also been impaired by house-price inflation, because it has either encouraged or forced people to stay put. Owner-occupiers in the south fear that if they move to another part of the country, they will never be able to return. Those tempted to come south to look for jobs cannot do so because homes are so expensive. History suggests that the current torpor will not last forever. There was a long period of stability between the end of the second world war and the start of the 1970s, but this was marked by an expansion of the housing supply and by much tighter credit conditions. Yet, keeping demand and supply in balance is not easy. Britons are culturally wedded to the idea of owning bricks and mortar and live on a small, crowded island where the planning laws are tight and the tax treatment of property generous. The population is rising and during the recession house building fell to its lowest level since the early 1920s. The City is confident there will not be an increase in the cost of borrowing from the Bank of England this year, and some analysts think there may not be one in 2013 either. Most of the conditions are already in place for the next boom, although the fact that property is still expensive and lenders are still hunkered down means it may not happen for some while. Preventing a future housing bubble is, rightly, a priority for the Bank, and it has been mulling over how to prevent one. Three boom-busts in 40 years are testimony to the abject failure of trying to control the property market through interest rates alone, and \u2013 not before time \u2013 there is now an acceptance that tougher curbs on credit will be required. The Bank's financial policy committee has been looking at two possible instruments \u2013 loan to value ratios and loan to income ratios \u2013 that it might deploy if it thought the housing market was getting too hot. The first would prevent lenders from offering loans above a certain percentage of the property's value; the second would limit the extension of credit to a certain multiple of a borrower's income. Make no mistake, these would be powerful weapons and even the threat that they might be deployed would have an impact. It would probably only require Sir Mervyn King to make a speech in which he said that the Bank was mulling the possibility of imposing a loan to value ratio of, say, 80% on all new mortgages for the market to be killed stone dead. Activity would dry up and prices would fall. The Bank has two big concerns about the use of these tools: that their use might damage the economy and that they may prevent people buying their own home. But the benefits of long-term stability outweigh the sugar rush from a housing boom, while the best way to encourage owner-occupation is to reduce prices. There is an opportunity to wean the UK off its addiction with house-price inflation and it should not be squandered.",

Its guidelines state that committees \"should not seek to make changes to any element of executive remuneration to compensate participants for changes in their personal status\". Pirc will issue a formal guidance note to shareholders before the meeting. The ABI said it would not be issuing a public statement on Barclays but had concerns over \"fair allocation of resources\". Barclays did not respond to requests for comment.",
