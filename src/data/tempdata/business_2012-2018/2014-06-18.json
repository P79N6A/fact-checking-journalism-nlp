The Fed's chairman, Janet Yellen, struck a largely optimistic note in her press conference, saying there are reasons \"why we should see sustained growth above the economy's potential,\" including rising home prices and an improving global economy.

Yellen also suggested that interest rates would stay low \"for a considerable period\" after the Fed's bond-buying program ends.

Its forecasts have been relatively chipper - or at least optimistic - through five years of a slow recovery. Now the tides seem be turning, and the recovery looks threatened. As Lindsey Group analyst Peter Boockvar wrote to clients today, \"their credibility is on the line if they ignore that the facts are now different.\" <br><br>What facts? Here's what observers are watching. <br><br><b>GDP:</b> Expect the Fed to cut its estimates. The Fed's estimates for GDP - which measures the overall productivity of the economy - were on the high side for 2014, with expectations of 2.8% to 3% growth. The actual latest growth figure is far, far below that: it's -1%. Being off by a few percentage points is a big issue for the Fed's credibility -- though to be fair, <a href=\"http://graphics.wsj.com/fed-predictions/#c[]=Janet+Yellen&amp;c[]=Charles+Plosser&amp;d=0\">it's used to being wrong.</a> Still, look for the Fed to join the reality-based community by cutting its forecasts for economic growth. <br><br><b>Unemployment:</b> Expect the Fed to cut its estimates. The Fed most recently expected the unemployment rate to fall to the range of 6.1 to 6.3% by the end of the year. It's already there, as Boockvar notes, with two straight months of 6.3% unemployment. but it doesn't tell the whole story. The reason the unemployment rate is falling is because more people are becoming disillusioned and dropping out of the workforce. The best measure of that dropout trend is called the the labor force participation rate, and it measures how many working-age adults actually have jobs. At the moment, it's 62.8% - one of the lowest percentages in 30 years. <br><br><b> Inflation:</b> Watch how the Fed interprets the data. After years of bafflement over why inflation remained so low, inflation is rising for consumers far faster than the Fed expected. The real-world measure of inflation, which is called the Consumer Price Index or CPI, is now at about 2% - far above the 1.7% that the Fed predicted in April. <br><br><b>Housing:</b> Watch how the Fed interprets the data. The housing market has been struggling more than the Fed expected, with expert Robert Shiller calling the trends <a href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000270189\">\"worrisome.\" </a>The rise in housing prices is supposed to make consumers feel rich enough to spend more money, but it's not accomplishing that. \"The spring home selling season has been mixed at best as investors have slowed down their purchase pace and the first time potential home buyer has been more inclined to rent,\" Boockvar wrote. <br><br><b>Interest rates:</b> The Federal Reserve's job is to manage interest rates, and investors have been waiting years for an increase in rates; they argue that low rates have been hurting savings. The Fed has indicated it won't raise interest rates until 2015 or later. With the economic picture worsening, however, it may be under pressure. <br></p> <p><b>Overall:</b> Expect a \"nothing to see here, folks,\" stance that will require a deeper interpretation of how the Fed is seeing the economy. Fed officials will probably try to make this week\u2019s FOMC meeting uneventful for markets, continuing to sound positive about the outlook,\" said economists at High-Frequency Economics.<b><br></b><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-06-18T17:44:45.146Z\">at 6.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53a1c68ee4b0093187a95f90\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-18T17:09:10.607Z\">6.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <b>Jessica Glenza</b> will take this live blog over before the Fed's announcement, at <b>2pm EST</b>.

If prices continue to rise slowly, the IMF argues, the ECB should consider following the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England by purchasing sovereign bonds.</p> <p>\u201cIf inflation remains stubbornly low, the ECB should consider a large-scale asset purchase programme, primarily of sovereign assets according to the ECB\u2019s capital key,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis would boost confidence, improve corporate and household balance sheets, and stimulate bank lending.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ca67d138-f6fb-11e3-9e9d-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz34mNtn3ja\">IMF calls on ECB to consider quantitative easing to stimulate growth</a></h2> <p>It's not the first time the IMF has pushed for more unconventional monetary policy - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/03/european-central-bank-meets-as-deflation-fears-grow-business-live\">Lagarde talked about QE in April too</a>.

The Committee noted that the low probability attached by the markets for a rate hike in 2014 was \u201csomewhat surprising\u201d. Moreover, June\u2019s minutes, as well as May\u2019s, pointed to the policy decision becoming \u201cmore balanced\u201d for some members.</p> <p>\u201cWhile today\u2019s minutes hint that a rate rise could come earlier than 2015, the case for hiking rates soon is far from cut and dried. Yesterday\u2019s inflation figures, which the MPC would not have had sight of, will reinforce the notion that inflation is not causing policy-makers any problems. Indeed, the MPC chose to revise down its expectation for inflation in Q2. The Committee also noted that underlying global weakness in inflationary pressures \u201cmight yet become evident in the UK\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Fed sharply cut its growth rates but continued tapering its bond-buying program, cutting it back to $35bn a month. Get the full story from the Guardian US economics editor Heidi Moore (@moorehn). Following the Fed announcement markets closed up Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial closed up 95 points and 0.58%, the Nasdaq is up 25 points and 0.59%, and the S&amp;P 500 is up almost 15 points and 0.77%. Analysts are reacting to Yellen's steady-as-she-goes tapering and interest rate announcements. A full transcript of Yellen's speech is now available. Want the full analysis of the feds announcement today? Check out the story by Guardian US economics editor Heidi Moore. The Federal Reserve press conference just ended. Now, a reporter asks how wages might grow over the next year. Yellen says right now it's flat, at 2%, and that it's likely to grow when there's less slack in labor market. My own expectation is that as the labor market begins to tighten, we will see wage growth pick up some to the point where real wage growth, where compensation or nominal wages are rising more rapidly than inflation, so households are getting a real increase in their take-home pay,\" Yellen said. Pedro da Costa (@pdacosta)of Dow Jones News Wires asks about the brewing conflict in Iraq and other global instability. Can the US be a, \"lone engine of economic\" growth globally? Broadly speaking, if the question is to what extent is monetary policy at this time being driven by financial stability concerns, I would say that while I would never take off the table that monetary policy should \u2013 could, in some circumstances, respond, I don't see them shaping monetary policy in an important way right now,\" says Yellen. Bloomberg TV and radio reporter Michael McKee (@mckonomy) asks how the Fed can keep from appearing to fall behind when it uses lagging indicators such as employment and inflation. \"We are very attentive to unfolding economic developments,\" said Yellen, and said she's committed to communicating that to the public, holding additional press conferences if necessary. When the Federal Reserve chair says the recession could have caused permanent damage, it doesn't go unnoticed. Benyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) asks how much monetary policy can change problems such as nagging unemployment. Yellen said there could be some \"permanent damage\" done by long-term unemployment. \"My hope would be, and my expectation is, that as the economy recovers, we will see some repair of that, that many of those individuals who were long-term unemployed or those who are now counted as out of the labor force would take jobs if the economy is stronger and would be drawn back in again. But it is conceivable that there's some permanent damage thereto, to them, to their own well-being, their family's well-being, and the economy's potential,\" said Yellen. Now, here's a question about the \"dot plot.\" Here's an explanation of how dot plots show interest rates by Business Insider. And a little dot plot humor below. \"It's true that unemployment has declined by more than the committee expected,\" said Yellen. Says the labor market has \"continued to broadly improve.\" However, she says that a portion of the decline in unemployment rate reflects a kind of \"shadow unemployment or discouragement\" for workers, and possibly demographics. Here's a great graphic on inflation measures. A CNBC reporter asks if the Federal Reserve isn't \"behind the curve\" on inflation, referencing a 2.1% consumer price index (CPI). Yellen says the data we're seeing is \"noisy.\" Personal consumer expenditure, or PCE, is what the Fed uses to measure inflation. That's at 1.42%. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen says that interest rates will likely remain low, even after the Reserve's asset buying program ends. Based on its current assessment of these factors, the committee anticipates that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2% longer-run goal and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored,\" Yellen said. The FOMC expects that inflation will fall back down to 2%, according to Yellen. Right now it's at 2.1%. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen has begun her press conference now. She concedes GDP is \"down notably\" from the March projections, to 2.1% to 2.3%, Yellen says, mostly because of the \"unexpected contractions\" in the first quarter. The open markets committee expects to continue winding down the bond-buying program. Most expect the Fed will end it in October. The central bank left open the door to adjusting the program however. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Federal Reserve saw further improvement in markets, it said in a press release. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that growth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months. Labor market indicators generally showed further improvement. The unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated. Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment resumed its advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Not all analysts agree though. More specifically about the taper \u2013 the Federal Reserve plans to buy $15bn worth of mortgage backed securities per month, and $20bn in treasury bonds each month, reducing each by $5bn. Despite saying that the economy was strong enough to reduce the stimulus, the Fed also slashed its projections for US growth. In March, the central bank projected US GDP growth at 2.8% to 3%. The bank now believes the economy will grow between 2.1% and 2.3%. Read the full statement here. The Federal Open Markets Committee announces, as expected, that it is continuing to wind down, or \"taper\" its bond-buying program known as quantitative easing. It said there was was \"sufficient underlying strength\" in the US economy to reduce the stimulus program by $10bn. The Fed will start buying $35bn per month in bonds and mortgage backed securities in July, instead of $45bn. Here's Guardian US economics editor Heidi Moore's primer on what to expect from Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen's 2pm press conference. This meeting will be the one where the Federal Reserve will have to prove it's connected to reality. Its forecasts have been relatively chipper - or at least optimistic - through five years of a slow recovery. Now the tides seem be turning, and the recovery looks threatened. As Lindsey Group analyst Peter Boockvar wrote to clients today, \"their credibility is on the line if they ignore that the facts are now different.\" What facts? Here's what observers are watching. GDP: Expect the Fed to cut its estimates. The Fed's estimates for GDP - which measures the overall productivity of the economy - were on the high side for 2014, with expectations of 2.8% to 3% growth. The actual latest growth figure is far, far below that: it's -1%. Being off by a few percentage points is a big issue for the Fed's credibility -- though to be fair, it's used to being wrong. Still, look for the Fed to join the reality-based community by cutting its forecasts for economic growth. Unemployment: Expect the Fed to cut its estimates. The Fed most recently expected the unemployment rate to fall to the range of 6.1 to 6.3% by the end of the year. It's already there, as Boockvar notes, with two straight months of 6.3% unemployment. but it doesn't tell the whole story. The reason the unemployment rate is falling is because more people are becoming disillusioned and dropping out of the workforce. The best measure of that dropout trend is called the the labor force participation rate, and it measures how many working-age adults actually have jobs. At the moment, it's 62.8% - one of the lowest percentages in 30 years. Inflation: Watch how the Fed interprets the data. After years of bafflement over why inflation remained so low, inflation is rising for consumers far faster than the Fed expected. The real-world measure of inflation, which is called the Consumer Price Index or CPI, is now at about 2% - far above the 1.7% that the Fed predicted in April. Housing: Watch how the Fed interprets the data. The housing market has been struggling more than the Fed expected, with expert Robert Shiller calling the trends \"worrisome.\" The rise in housing prices is supposed to make consumers feel rich enough to spend more money, but it's not accomplishing that. \"The spring home selling season has been mixed at best as investors have slowed down their purchase pace and the first time potential home buyer has been more inclined to rent,\" Boockvar wrote. Interest rates: The Federal Reserve's job is to manage interest rates, and investors have been waiting years for an increase in rates; they argue that low rates have been hurting savings. The Fed has indicated it won't raise interest rates until 2015 or later. With the economic picture worsening, however, it may be under pressure. Overall: Expect a \"nothing to see here, folks,\" stance that will require a deeper interpretation of how the Fed is seeing the economy. Fed officials will probably try to make this week\u2019s FOMC meeting uneventful for markets, continuing to sound positive about the outlook,\" said economists at High-Frequency Economics. My colleague Jessica Glenza will take this live blog over before the Fed's announcement, at 2pm EST. Goodbye from London. GW It's now less than 90 minute until the Federal Reserve announces the conclusions of this week's monetary policy meeting, followed by Janet Yellen's second press conference since succeeding Ben Bernanke. The FOMC announcement comes at 2pm New York time, with the press conference at 2.30pm. Wall Street will be looking for several different things. For example: 1) Did the Fed keep tapering? - it's expected to lop another $10bn off it bond-buying stimulus programme. 2) The new economic forecasts. Will the Fed follow the IMF's lead and cut its forecast for growth this year, now it's seen that the economy shrank a little over the winter. 3) And what will Yellen say about inflation - which rose unexpectedly to an annual rate of 2.1% last month - and job creation? Reporters will want to know how she thinks interest rates could return to more normal levels. 4) We get the Fed's famous/notorious dot chart - showing where policy-setters believe interest rates will be in the medium term. And heres are some handy charts showing US inflation, from Nomura. Interesting.. the FT's Peter Speigel is reporting that the International Monetary Fund will tomorrow recommend that the eurozone considers a US-style quantitative easing programme to ward off deflation. Here's a flavour: The IMF evaluation, to be presented by managing director Christine Lagarde to eurozone finance ministers on Thursday in Luxembourg, credits the EU with taking \u201cstrong policy action\u201d that \u201claid the foundations for recovery\u201d after the eurozone crisis. But it also concludes that both debt levels and unemployment remain too high and could impair a return to \u201crobust\u201d growth. While the fund welcomes recent measures adopted by the ECB, which earlier this month took the unprecedented step of cutting one of its key interest rates below zero and offering up to \u20ac400bn in cheap loans to banks who agree to lend to small businesses, it suggests they may not be enough. The draft IMF statement finds that eurozone \u201cinflation is worryingly low, including in the core countries\u201d, stifling demand and growth. If prices continue to rise slowly, the IMF argues, the ECB should consider following the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England by purchasing sovereign bonds. \u201cIf inflation remains stubbornly low, the ECB should consider a large-scale asset purchase programme, primarily of sovereign assets according to the ECB\u2019s capital key,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis would boost confidence, improve corporate and household balance sheets, and stimulate bank lending. More here: IMF calls on ECB to consider quantitative easing to stimulate growth It's not the first time the IMF has pushed for more unconventional monetary policy - Lagarde talked about QE in April too. But it will intensify pressure on the ECB to ease policy. Over in the eurozone, Cyprus has held a successful bond auction today - selling more debt than initially planned. Cyprus found buyers for \u20ac750m of five-year bonds, up from a target of \u20ac500m, at a yield of reportedly around 4.85%. Finance minister Harris Georgiades told reporters that the move was an important step towards eventually returning to the financial markets after its bailout, which began 15 months ago. \"This issue means that we will be able to refinance a significant part of the present domestic debt and achieving a lower debt re-servicing cost\" Oh, and the session is still viewable on the Parliament Live site. To recap - highlights of Kristin Forbes' appearance before MPs ahead of joining the Bank of England start here: And her warning about 'sanguine' bond investors taking risks is here. Peter Spence of City AM has the story on how Kristin Forbes defended using the inflation rate as the main target for the Bank of England, rather than nominal GDP: Here's why new Bank of England staffer Kristin Forbes is defending inflation targeting Kristin Forbes has suggested that some investors are 'too sanguine' about the risks from countries such as Spain. Asked by Treasury committee member David Ruffley MP about her concerns about risk pricing in the markets, Forbes pointed out that Spanish 10-year bonds are now trading at the same risk premium as UK 10-year gilts. She says: That, to me, suggests that something's not quite right, and that some investors are too sanguine about the risks to Spain. She's right about the headline numbers (UK 10-year gilts are trading at 2.74%, Spain's 10-year bonds are at 2.76%). But caution is needed with these comparisons - Spain's debt is in euros, in a currency union where inflation and growth rates are much lower [making sovereign debt more attractive], and with the ECB preparing to ease monetary policy further (even QE, perhaps) It's not apples and apples, basically. And one bond yield doesn't give a full assessment of risk premium (although that 10-year gilt yield is a decent benchmark). Still, Forbes's broader point is that investors are taking risks in a search for yield; a serious issue today. And that was the end of the hearing: Forbes also reveals that she's frustrated by the quality of UK data related to investment and trade: Asked about 'forbearance' (whether banks hold off from repossessing a house on a mortgage in arrears), Forbes says she doesn't know exactly how banks will act when rates rise, but monetary policy can't be set based on \"risks to small number of highly indebted Britons\". The Treasury committee ask why the Bank of England (like many major central banks) is targeting a 2% inflation rate. Kristen Forbes reveals that she's asked the BoE this very question -- and the answer is usually that academic papers have suggested it's a sensible level to aim for.... Will Kristen Forbes relocate full-time to the UK when she joins the Bank of England? She explains that she'd hoped to move this summer, but is now planning to commute back and forth from Boston for the first 12 months (spending weekends in the US). She cites her partners' work commitments and getting their child into private schools. How will you make a living? Forbes points out that she'll be paid by the Bank of England - she will give some lectures back in the US, but mainly she'll be carrying out her MPC responsibilities here. Forbes also gets a real googly - explaining Mark Carney's forward guidance. She explains (at some length) that it hinges around key data (such as spare capacity), and a pledge that interest rates won't increase until the Bank has clear evidence that the economy is ready. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie jokes that he thought it was a trick question. Some Treasury Committee members are suggesting that it would make more sense for the Bank of England to target nominal GDP (ie, the growth rate plus the inflation rate). Kristen Forbes replies that inflation rate targeting works better (not everyone is convinced) - also, it's the government's job to set the mandate, and the Bank's job to carry it out. The Treasury committee are probing whether Kristen Forbes has the experience for the MPC. They establishing that she's never held a job in the UK (Forbes explains that she's worked internationally, including several visits to the UK). Has she ever worked specifically on monetary policy? Forbes explains that she's worked extensively on macroeconomics \u2013 covering issues such as global capital flows and the contagion that is created when shocks occur around the world (everyone remembers the eurozone crisis, right? -- and just look at the impact of the Iraq insurgency on the oil price). Aren't these issues for the Financial Policy Committee? No, Forbes says. These are precisely the issues that the MPC needs when setting monetary policy, she argues - and having a range of skills increases the chances they'll get interest rate levels right. Asked whether the MPC's mandate should change, Forbes argues that inflation targeting has done \"very well\", as a policy goal across the business cycle. On interest rate policies, Kristen Forbes echoes the tone of this morning's Bank of England minutes. She says that delaying adjusting monetary policy while policymakers await more information runs the risk of needing sharper adjustments in future. So starting tightening monetary policy earlier would offer more flexibility, if need. But... an earlier adjustment to monetary policy also increases the risk of slowing the recovery, if it's premature. Back in London, Kristen Forbes - one of two female economists who joins the Bank of England this summer - is testifying to parliament's Treasury committee. Here's a live feed. Reuters provides the key points so far: BANK OF ENGLAND INCOMING MPC MEMBER KRISTIN FORBES SAYS PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH HAS BEEN UNUSUALLY WEAK, ESPECIALLY FOR A RECOVERY BOE'S FORBES SAYS DECLINE IN UK SAVINGS RATE CANNOT BE SUSTAINED WITHOUT PRESENTING MAJOR RISKS BOE'S FORBES SAYS ANY INCREASE IN ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY COULD QUICKLY CAUSE BUSINESSES TO DELAY BUSINESS INVESTMENT BOE'S FORBES SAYS FULLY APPRECIATE I STILL HAVE MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT THE UK ECONOMIC SITUATION BOE'S FORBES SAYS UNCLEAR IF CURRENT SOURCES OF GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT GAINS ARE SUSTAINABLE BOE'S FORBES SAYS MPC MUST STILL MONITOR HOUSING MARKET TO ASSESS IF FPC HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ADDRESSING FINANCIAL STABILITY CONCERNS BOE'S FORBES SAYS DOES NOT BELIEVE ASSET PRICES SHOULD BE TARGETTED, BUT MONITORED Kristen Forbes is currently professor of management and global economics at MIT's Sloan School of Management, having previously served as an advisor to the White House. She's also an expert in financial market contagion. Tech stocks are making the early running in New York. Shares in Adobe Systems have jumped 9% after reporting a bigger-than-expected rise in new subscriptions to its cloud-based services. And Amazon shares have risen 1.5% - it's expected to announce its first smartphone later today. Ding ding ding - that's the noise of the Wall Street opening bell being rung, and shares are now doing, well, not a lot. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by just 0.1% to 16791 points, with the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 both flattish too. Traders are waiting to learn what the Fed's Open Market Committee has decided, and then Janet Yellen's press conference.... The Fed is already trying to drum up an audience for Janet Yellen's press conference, even though it doesn't start for five hours: Here's something for the Federal Reserve to ponder at today's meeting: the US current account deficit has widened sharply. The gap between US imports and exports (covering goods, investments and services) swelled to $111.2bn in the first quarter of this year, the US Commerce Department reported. That's the biggest in 18 months, Reuters says. It appears that America's bad winter drove the trade gap wider, as factories found it harder to produce and ship goods abroad during the most icy weather in some time. Exports fell by 1.3% during the quarter, while imports rose by 1.5%. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, says the looming Federal Reserve meeting means Wall Street will be rather \"subdued\": Futures markets have already called the open as flat and there's very little in the way of fundamentals due ahead of the bell to provide any real influence here. Obviously any change in the Iraqi situation could inject a degree of volatility but for now we're calling the DOW to open down 2 at 16806 and the S&amp;P up 1 at 1943. That could change once the second most powerful woman in the world (says Forbes) gives her insight into the US economy and monetary policy. So, one central bank down, one to go. And it's the biggie later today \u2013 the US Federal Reserve announcing its latest monetary policy decisions, followed by a press conference with Fed chair Janet Yellen. Economists don't expect any real shocks -- the Fed is expected to cut its stimulus programme (buying up US Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds with new money) by $10bn, to $35bn per month. But Wall Street (and beyond) will be listening to hear what Yellen says about the future path of interest rates. The Fed will also issue new economic forecasts; with great timing, we learned yesterday that the US inflation rate had risen faster than expected, to an annual rate of 2.1% in May. That has \"spiced up\" the FOMC meeting, says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale. The trend has been up for a while and the risk of deflation, still prevalent in Europe, just isn't there in the US at the moment. With inflation at a tolerable level, it's easier to see how out of line Fed policy is with the underlying growth rate of the economy. The announcement comes at 2pm New York time, or 7pm London, with Yellen's press conference starting 30 minutes later.... The pound has fallen back from its five-year highs, to $1.695 against the US dollar, as investors calculate that today's Bank of England minutes are less hawkish than expected -- with members voting 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged. Economists are split over when rates will rise, after digesting a set of minutes that show widening splits at the BoE over the amount of spare capacity in the labour market. Some believe borrowing costs will jump this year, such as Alastair Winter of Daniel Stewart Securities, who said The first interest rate increase will have to be in November or December to avoid the MPC looking foolish over forward guidance. Others are less sure, pointing to the lack of price pressures at present. As Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, put it: The very benign outlook for inflation makes it far from a given. Three key point stand out in the minutes 1) that the decision on when to raise rates is 'more balanced' for some members of the MPC. 2) the committee is struggling to guess how much spare capacity is left -- how to reconcile strong economic growth and falling unemployment with weak inflation and low wage growth 3) The MPC had the nerve to say it was 'surprised' that markets had felt there was little chance of an interest rate rise this year. That sent eyebrows soaring in the City, given governor Mark Carney's regular pronouncements on forward guidance. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg bank, nailed it thus: That is almost ironic given how much Mark Carney and the other MPC members had done until last week\u2019s Mansion House speech to convince markets that any rate hike was still a very long way off, even when the evidence of sizeable slack in the economy started evaporating at ever faster rates on a monthly basis. Angela Monaghan's news story on the minutes is here: Interest rate rises: Bank of England minutes hint at shift of stance Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, reckons at least one member of the MPC will break ranks and vote for a rate rise soon. She writes: \u201cThe Bank of England reiterated that rate rises would be slow and gradual, but even it couldn\u2019t deny that the future rate would move in line with economic developments. MPC members now see the gaining pace of the UK recovery as undeniable, even unstoppable, and are second-guessing their view of economic slack evident in low inflation and wage pressures. \u201cThe Bank has issued a blatant warning sign to markets that there could well be a rate rise this year and it seems more likely than ever that the first vote for higher interest rates is just around the corner.\u201d A speech from Martin Weale, a hawkish member of the Monetary Policy Committee, just landed. And it doesn't sound quite as hawkish as one might expect, from a man that some City experts thought might have voted for a rate hike this month. Speaking in Belfast, Weale does make the point that if the Bank is committed to \"gradually\" raising rates then it should start \"sooner than would otherwise be the case.\" And Weale adds that that the decision on raising rates is \"becoming more balanced, with two opposing forces of uncertain magnitude pushing in different directions.\" On the one hand -- the idea that existing measures of underemployment may be overstating the underlying amount of spare capacity in the labour market. On the other -- a continuing and unusual weakness in wages, which may indicate there is more spare capacity in the economy than the MPC has assumed. As Weale puts it: \u201cShould wage growth fail to revive, that will, on its own, tip the scales further in favour of maintaining a strong monetary stimulus.\u201d However, he also predicts that annual wage growth will reach the range 2.5% to 3% by the end of this year -- enough to justify higher rates? The speech is here. There's something \"almost ironic\" in the Bank of England saying it was \"surprised\" that the financial markets were suggesting a 2014 rate rise was so unlikely. So says Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg bank, pointing out that the Bank has spent most of the last year pushing Mark Carney's precious forward guidance, that the UK labour market remains too weak to support higher rates. Schulz reckons rates will probably rise by November, despite the current low inflation. Here's why: The pressure on the BoE to hike rates immediately remains subdued as long as actual inflation remains below target and wage growth remains weak. But these are lagging the economic cycle and currently distorted by temporary effects like the late Easter, tax changes last year and appreciating sterling. We expect the unease with easy money amongst the more hawkish spectrum of BoE policy makers to grow and lead to the first individual votes for a hike, potentially this summer. A majority for a first hike should be achieved in November this year. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, has summed up the Bank's minutes: \u201cA more dovish tone than the surprisingly hawkish views on interest rates presented by Mark Carney in his Mansion House speech is evident, which raises questions about the governor\u2019s apparent shift in thinking. \u201cThat said, the minutes do provide some answers. The Committee noted that the low probability attached by the markets for a rate hike in 2014 was \u201csomewhat surprising\u201d. Moreover, June\u2019s minutes, as well as May\u2019s, pointed to the policy decision becoming \u201cmore balanced\u201d for some members. \u201cWhile today\u2019s minutes hint that a rate rise could come earlier than 2015, the case for hiking rates soon is far from cut and dried. Yesterday\u2019s inflation figures, which the MPC would not have had sight of, will reinforce the notion that inflation is not causing policy-makers any problems. Indeed, the MPC chose to revise down its expectation for inflation in Q2. The Committee also noted that underlying global weakness in inflationary pressures \u201cmight yet become evident in the UK\u201d. And the possibility that labour supply might be stronger than expected was also mooted, pointing to continuing weak wage growth. \u201cWhile the Committee has acted in unison since 2011, there is an increasing probability that the single voice of the MPC will soon fracture. The changing make-up of the MPC, with three new members in place by August, could be the catalyst for a shift in thinking. The chances that 2014 will see the first hike in Bank Rate in six years may seem to be on the rise, but the very benign outlook for inflation makes it far from a given.\u201d Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart Securities, reckons the Bank of England start raise interest rates before the end of the year, but only gradually. \"The first interest rate increase will have to be in November or December to avoid the MPC looking foolish over forward guidance. Carney is trading doing an early 1st or 2nd increase against going too fast . I don't think rates will get to 3% until early 2017 which will still be high enough to encourage companies to borrow and people to feel comfortable servicing their mortgages.\" The minutes show the MPC is \"increasingly divided about the appropriate time for tightening\", says Nick Beecroft, senior market analyst at Saxo Capital Markets. Thus Mark Carney's warning during his Mansion House speech that rates could rise faster than markets expect (ed). \u201cIn short, the supertanker is slowing turning towards a tightening bias, and the Governor was keen to prepare us for this last week.\u201d The minutes are not the 'hawkish' surprise that some in the markets were predicting, says World First's Jeremy Cook. He reckons the crucial point in the minutes is that \"the precise timing\" of a rise would depend on the outlook for inflation (which fell last month). And thus, wage rises. \u201cIn short, the Bank of England is unable to forecast our look for rate increases at the moment and, as we have been tub-thumping for a while, this will depend on real wage increases. And with inflation still rising twice as fast as wages, there's still plenty of slack in the system, he suggests. Jake Trask, corporate dealer at UKForex, reckons the minutes show that UK interest rates probably won't rise until next year. \u201cAnyone expecting a surprise split vote for a rate rise were left disappointed by the release of the MPC minutes, which showed another 9-0 vote against increasing borrowing costs. Speculation had been growing since Mark Carney\u2019s bullish comments last week at Mansion House that MPC member Martin Weale might have voted for a rate rise in the 4-5th June meeting; however, this was proved incorrect. It still looks like a rate rise will be a 2015 event, although, should the run of strong UK data continue, there is a chance that a rate rise may happen around the time of the November Inflation Report.\u201d The pound has fallen back against the US dollar as the City digests the minutes, losing half a cent to $1.695. The fact that the MPC remained united to leave rates unchanged has dampened speculation of an early rate-- even though some members are wavering... Some more instant reaction: The Monetary Policy Committee is rather split over how much slack remains in the UK labour market -- which is one key factor in deciding when rates rise. And the weak growth in earnings is a concern, given the pace of economic growth. On the 'spare capacity' question, the minute say: On the one hand, output growth had been stronger, and unemployment had fallen faster, than had been anticipated by the MPC and most other forecasters. On the other hand, wage growth and inflation had been weaker. One possible explanation was that the effective labour supply was greater than previously thought. This means wage growth, and its impact on prices, becomes crucial to when rates rise. Another interesting line from the BoE minutes -- the MPC discussed whether rates should start rising soon, if they will ultimately peak at a historically low level: ...it could be argued that the more gradual the intended rise in Bank Rate, the earlier it might be necessary to start tightening policy. However, if you raise too early, you risk wiping out potential output - and it's rather hard to cut rates again if it goes wrong. The minutes also include this gem - that the Bank of England is surprised by the financial markets didn't think interest rates were likely to rise this year: There was, however, a risk that growth would not slow in the second half of the year so that, without a corresponding rise in supply, slack would be absorbed more quickly than had previously been expected. In that context, the relatively low probability attached to a Bank Rate increase this year implied by some financial market prices was somewhat surprising. It's almost as if they'd been listening to Mark Carney's forward guidance, that rates would probably remain at their record low for some time. Some Bank of England policymakers have moved closer to voting for an interest rate rise, although the final vote at this month's meeting was 9-0 to leave them unchanged. The minutes explain that \"some\" of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Commitee believe the question of whether enough spare capacity has been absorbed has become \"more balanced\" since May. Here's the key section: The economy was starting to return to normal. Part of that normalisation would be a rise in Bank Rate at some point. The precise timing of the rise would depend on the outlook for inflation. That, in turn, would depend on the data flow, and in particular what that implied for the degree of slack, the prospects for its absorption, and the broader outlook for wages. For some members, the policy decision had become more balanced in the past couple of months than earlier in the year. In terms of the immediate policy decision, however, all members agreed that, in the absence of other inflationary pressures, it would be necessary to see more evidence of slack being absorbed before an increase in Bank Rate would be warranted. The minutes are online here. Here we go: The Bank of England's monetary policy committee voted 9-0 to leave interest rates at their record low of 0.5%, at its meeting two weeks ago. The minutes, just released, also show that the Bank was \"somewhat surprised\" that the financial markets were pricing in a low probability of interest rates rising this year. More to follow! Just 10 minutes until the Bank of England reveals whether there was heated debate at its last monetary policy committee meeting.... A couple of developments between Britain and China this morning. 1) China Construction Bank (CCB) has been named as London's first bank to act as a clearing bank for the Chinese renminbi (RMB) -- the first renminbi clearing bank outside Asia. The Treasury says it is ...part of the government\u2019s long-term economic plan to establish Britain as the western hub of Chinese finance. 2) China's central bank has announced that the yuan will start trading directly against sterling in the interbank foreign exchange market, from Thursday. That's also billed as a move to strengthen trade links between the two countries. City traders are reporting that Cyprus is on track to sell its first sovereign debt in a public auction* since last year's bailout. It's offering a five-year bond this morning, at an interest rate of 5% -- not too shabby, given its recent troubles. * - Cyprus sold some debt to one private investor recently, but this is the first time it's actually gone to the markets to borrow since the dramatic days of March 2013 Back on the Bank of England, and Jeremy Cook of World First reckons today's minutes may show sharp differences over how much spare capacity is lingering in UK labour market: Today\u2019s minutes will be raked through for potentially hawkish clues to back up the deviation in the Governor\u2019s language from his first year at the head of the Bank of England. The obvious place for differing views is within the unemployment market, such is the nature of the Bank\u2019s forward guidance plan. While the overall unemployment rate is below the original 7% level that was used as a waypoint for rate rises, the issue of slack in the economy has taken over. Carney estimated that overall slack in the jobs market was somewhere between 1-1.5% at last month\u2019s Quarterly Inflation Report; we\u2019ll see how much of a consensus that view is. There could also have been a lively debate about real wage growth (or the lack of it). More in this video clip: In other corporate news, property website Zoopla priced its stock market flotation at the lower end of its guidance today - perhaps a sign that speculation of an early interest rate rise hit demand? The offer price was set 220p - having previously set a range of 200p-250p. That values the firm, whose sites include Primelocation, at \u00a3919m. Are we all eating less Ambrosia custard and Batchelors Soup? What about Mr Kipling's cakes? Premier Foods warned that sales of its 'Power Brands' have unexpectedly fallen in the second quarter of this year, blaming \"subdued grocery markets\". Shares in the company promptly tumbled by 6.5% - not exceedingly good news for investors. It's another sign that the supermarket sector is getting tight (yesterday's inflation data showed the first fall in food prices in almost a decade). And here are those 'Power Brands' in full: The other development in Argentina overnight (apart from the S&amp;P downgrade) is that it is taking steps to swap 'restructured' bonds, to place them under Argentinian law. This could allow Argentina to get around Monday's US Supreme Court defeat. It could then keep making payments to creditors who helped it lower its debt burden after the 2001 default, rather than the 'holdout' hedge funds who want paying in full. As economy minister Axel Kicillof put it: We cannot allow (holdouts) to prevent us from honoring our commitments to creditors.\" But such a move could also move Argentina closer to defaulting - as it would no longer be meeting the terms of the original bonds. Chris Weston of IG points out that the cost of insuring its debt (using a credit default swap, or CDS) has risen to a five-month high. Yesterday\u2019s speech by the economy minister to congress that the government plans to swap exchange bonds into Argentine law seems significant. Many feel this puts them on a path for default and we should see this in today\u2019s session, with further selling of Argentine bonds, while the CDS premium should continue to spike. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale reckons the MPC minutes will be \"fascinating\" \u2013 why else did governor Carney shock the markets by hinting at a rate rise last Thursday night? Surely there was something in the meeting to get Mr Carmey to be so bold at the Mansion House. I mean, he wan't really going for headlines at the start of Brazil/Croatia, was he? With inflation down, the stakes go up. Juckes reckons UK interest rates are too low, given the economy is growing at 3% per year, so \"the splits in the MPC are likely to widen\". Ian Williamson of Peel Hunt hopes the minutes will explain why Carney hinted at an early rate rise, only for yesterday's inflation data to be weaker than expected (at just 1.5%) He says: May's UK CPI data only added to the puzzlement surrounding the more hawkish message delivered by Governor Carney last week, although the causes of that change of heart may become clearer after today's MPC minutes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. How close is the Bank of England, really, to gritting its teeth and raising interest rates? There's been a lot of talk, from governor Mark Carney downwards, but this morning we see whether anyone on the Monetary Policy Committee actually wants some action. The minutes of the MPC meeting a fortnight ago, released at 9.30am, will show whether any members broke the 9-0 voting consensus and pushed for a hike (unlikely), and also show if the wider committee thinks it's almost time to start hiking (more likely). Carney's hawkish Mansion House speech last week has changed the agenda; Monex Europe's analyst Eimear Daly reckons the minutes will be pretty interesting: Elsewhere, pressure continues to build on Argentina, after losing its court case against hedge funds pushing for debt issued before its 2001 default to be honoured in full. Overnight, S&amp;P slashed its credit rating to just CCC-, citing a higher risk of default, now that Buenos Aires has been ordered to repay those bonds alongside its restructured debt - something president Fernandez continues to resist. While in the eurozone, some Greek public health workers are holding a strikes; and Cyprus is expected to hold a public bond auction - a milestone in its bailout programme. And the markets are likely to be edgy ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting tonight, where the US central bank is expected to trim its stimulus programme again. We'll be tracking the main action through the day....",

The next ambition seems to be to try to charge as much as Rightmove. The market leader, on its latest numbers, gets \u00a3607 a branch per month from estate agents. Zoopla achieves \u00a3301 and would clearly prefer to float upwards. Rather than do-or-die combat, this scrap will be fought between a company with a 70% profit margin and one that starts at 45% and would like to have 70%. Unfair? Some estate agents, mindful of the risk of price rises, think so and are committed to launching Agents Mutual. Their tactic, though, seems bizarre: its estate agents can only join Agents Mutual if they drop their advertising with either Rightmove or Zoopla; they can use one website but not both. How is that proposition meant to benefit the end-user, homeowners wanting to sell their houses for the best price? Sellers, one suspects, will insist on being on both the biggest websites. One of these years somebody will find a popular and efficient way to remove estate agents altogether from the business of buying and selling houses. But we're not there yet, and Rightmove and Zoopla are definitely not in the game of trying to kill their advertisers. Their profit margins look fabulously rich but, provided the pair don't exploit their duopoly too ruthlessly, it is also hard to see what's going to change. \u2022 This article was corrected on 19 June",

      "bodyText": "Network Rail is tapping into the trend for online shopping pick-up points by announcing plans for click-and-collect stores at more than 300 stations. The owner of Britain's rail tracks and stations has teamed up with Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman to invest \u00a324m in the co-owned business, called Doddle, which it says will create more than 3,000 jobs over the next three years. A pilot outlet, where shoppers can pick up items bought online from retailers including Asos, New Look and TM Lewin, is already open in Milton Keynes. Further stores will open in London Waterloo, Bromley South, Brighton, Chelmsford and London Cannon Street before the end of August. Doddle is part of a growing network of click-and-collect operators which are springing up to make life easier for online shoppers. London Underground tested click and collect points for supermarket Asda in six station carparks last year and is also working with Tesco, Waitrose and parcel locker company Inpost to offer services at several more stations. Meanwhile, Amazon has put collection lockers in stores including Co-op outlets, as its rival eBay teams up with Argos. At the same time retailers including John Lewis are working with Collect+, a scheme that allows shoppers to pick up and return items bought online at more than 5,000 independent retailers. Network Rail said 30 million people, equivalent to 59% of British consumers, now use click and collect services, a rise of 7 million in six months. As shoppers try to save money on deliveries and avoid the inconvenience of waiting in at home for goods to arrive, such services are seeing explosive growth. Network Rail said its service would be available to every retailer, online specialist and parcel service, with more brands to be announced soon. It said it was working with Dorfman, who built Travelex from a small currency exchange shop in 1976 to a global foreign exchange busines, because he was a neutral figure not linked to an existing retail brand. A spokesperson said: \"While teaming up with a high street brand could have been beneficial, it would have limited the scope of the business. The real benefit of Doddle is that it is open to all retailers and parcel delivery companies, providing the only service where customers can combine multiple collections and returns at a time that suits them.\" Dorfman said he wanted to use his experience to build \"a game-changing service for millions of online shoppers.\"",

      "bodyText": "The upmarket housebuilder Berkeley Group completed 30% more homes last year than during the pre-crisis market peak in 2007, as investor interest in the firm's homes in London and the south-east stayed strong. Berkeley said it completed 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April. The average selling price on its private, affordable and student homes increased to \u00a3423,000 from \u00a3354,000 the year before. Pre-tax profit soared 40% to \u00a3293m on revenue up 18% at \u00a31.62bn. Berkeley said: \"London's standing as a global city continues to drive demand and attract investment from within the UK and overseas. London's success is crucial to economic growth and a plentiful supply of good-quality new homes and places is essential to supporting this.\" Berkeley said the government's Help to Buy scheme had helped to support the broader housing market, but that the mortgage subsidy had little effect on its sales, which are largely off-plan. Housebuilder Crest Nicholson said on Tuesday that almost 40% of its first-half house sales were supported by Help to Buy, compared with about 4% for Berkeley last year. The scheme subsidises mortgages for first-time buyers of homes worth up to \u00a3600,000. Official figures showed on Wednesday that UK house prices had risen 10% in the past year, but that prices in London had jumped by almost double that rate, at nearly 19%. Price increases have partly been driven by overseas investors buying homes before they are put on the market, fuelling concerns about a property bubble in London. Despite signs that the London market may be cooling, policymakers remain concerned about the recent surge in prices. The Bank of England has indicated that interest rates could rise for the first time in more than five years before the end of 2014. The Bank's financial policy committee is also considering using new powers such as mortgage controls to intervene in the market. Berkeley's chairman, Tony Pidgley, said the company was building on all its sites with planning permission and that there was scope to build more homes. \"Provided any future increases in interest rates or regulation of mortgages are matched with future wages growth as the economy expands, the prospects for the housing market remain positive.\" With the housing market underpinned by government policies, Berkeley said it was keeping an eye on political developments with less than a year to go until a new government is elected. \"The group remains alert to the uncertainty which will arise from changes to the economic and political landscape in the run-up to a 2015 general election and may impact the business and the market more generally,\" it said.",

      "body": "<p>Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England's new chief economist, is a man at ease with an extended metaphor. His speech in Scarborough borrowed a cricketing term \u2013 \"the corridor of uncertainty\", which refers to the difficulty a batsman faces in deciding whether to play a well-pitched delivery off the back or front foot \u2013 to describe the Bank's dilemma on interest rates.</p> <p>Playing late allows more time to read the ball, or the economic data, but risks a hurried shot. Playing early allows a more gradual forward movement, but the danger is that the initial first movement is misjudged.</p> <p>Yes, that's a neat summary: the Bank doesn't want to choke the recovery, but an emergency rate of 0.5% can't last forever when the economy is growing at an annualised rate of 4%. So, tell us, what's the best strategy when you're in the corridor of uncertainty? That is where Haldane abandoned his metaphor. Economic statistics \u2013 unlike cricket batting averages \u2013 lie, he explained. Call it an elegant way of saying \"dunno\".</p> <p>Much the same could be said of Martin Weale's speech. By reputation, he's a front-foot player, or the MPC member most likely to vote first for a rate rise, but his speech in Belfast hardly reinforced the caricature. \"Should wage growth fail to revive, that will, on its own, tip the scales further in favour of maintaining a strong monetary stimulus,\" he said.</p> <p>So why did governor Mark Carney say last week that the first rise in rates could be sooner than the market thinks?

      "bodyText": "Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England's new chief economist, is a man at ease with an extended metaphor. His speech in Scarborough borrowed a cricketing term \u2013 \"the corridor of uncertainty\", which refers to the difficulty a batsman faces in deciding whether to play a well-pitched delivery off the back or front foot \u2013 to describe the Bank's dilemma on interest rates. Playing late allows more time to read the ball, or the economic data, but risks a hurried shot. Playing early allows a more gradual forward movement, but the danger is that the initial first movement is misjudged. Yes, that's a neat summary: the Bank doesn't want to choke the recovery, but an emergency rate of 0.5% can't last forever when the economy is growing at an annualised rate of 4%. So, tell us, what's the best strategy when you're in the corridor of uncertainty? That is where Haldane abandoned his metaphor. Economic statistics \u2013 unlike cricket batting averages \u2013 lie, he explained. Call it an elegant way of saying \"dunno\". Much the same could be said of Martin Weale's speech. By reputation, he's a front-foot player, or the MPC member most likely to vote first for a rate rise, but his speech in Belfast hardly reinforced the caricature. \"Should wage growth fail to revive, that will, on its own, tip the scales further in favour of maintaining a strong monetary stimulus,\" he said. So why did governor Mark Carney say last week that the first rise in rates could be sooner than the market thinks? Well, clearly it could, but that's just stating the obvious. We assumed something had happened on the MPC to shift the scales, to use Weale's word. There was nothing in the minutes to suggest so. The May minutes said: \"For some members the monetary policy decision was becoming more balanced.\" The June minutes said: \"For some members, the policy decision had become more balanced in the past couple of months than earlier in the year.\" No difference there. All that's really changed, it would seem, is that Bank officials are anxious to tell us what a difficult decision they face on timing. We knew that, though. All this clarifying is very confusing.",

      "bodyText": "More than 1.76 million people joined the ranks of the global super-rich last year as stock-market gains and soaring property prices swelled personal fortunes worldwide. A record 13.7 million people are now classed as \"high net worth individuals\" (HNWI), according to a survey of the planet's most well-off citizens. The collective wealth of HNWIs \u2013 defined as those with investable assets of at least $1m (\u00a3590,000) not including their main home, their art collection or vintage sports cars \u2013 rose by 13.8% to $52.6tn. The latest wealth report by consultancy firm Capgemini and the wealth management arm of banking group RBC found that almost 40% of those fortunes were created in the last five years. In Britain, more than 62,000 people became HNWIs last year, bringing their numbers to a record high of 527,000 \u2013 or one in every 121 of the population. George King, RBC's head of portfolio strategy, who advises the super-wealthy on where to invest their money, said there are now so many super-rich people that it is hard to distinguish \"millionaires next door\" from the general population. \"Most of them are quite normal,\" he said, adding that \"90% plus are people next door, they're not oligarchs, they don't look any different. They're not ostentatious.\" In order to distinguish the super-rich from the uber-rich, a second category exists within the survey dubbed \"ultra-HNWI\", who have more than $30m of assets to invest. There are 128,000 of these \u2013 an increase of 18,000 on the previous year \u2013 who collectively hold assets worth $18tn. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the report highlighted concerns that a \"super-rich clique appear to be hogging the proceeds of growth for themselves\" while real wages for ordinary workers are falling or are under pressure. \"A stock market-led recovery may be great for rich share owners but it does nothing to improve the living standards of the majority,\" she said. \"Unless we have more balanced and equal growth \u2013 starting with fairer wages for all \u2013 the benefits of recovery will pass many people by.\" King said the majority of the Britons joining the club had done so with the help of rising property prices. \"There is a really strong preference for real estate and it shows no signs of going away,\" he said. Despite the increase in the UK's wealthy, Britain is far behind the US in terms of the total number of HNWIs. In the US there are 4.3 million people with more than $1m investable assets, an increase of 16.6% on the previous year. The top four global economic powers \u2013 the US, Japan, Germany and China \u2013 are home to 60% of the worldwide population of HNWIs.The Asia-Pacific region recorded the biggest growth in number of HNWIs to 4.33 million, leaving the region just 10,000 super-rich people short of overtaking north America. RBC and Capgemini analysts said the Asia-Pacific region would almost certainly overtake north America this year. \"Global HNWI financial wealth is forecast to grow 6.9% annually through 2016 to reach a new record high of $64.3tn, with an additional $11.7tn in NHWI wealth created over the three-year period 2014-2016,\" the analysts said. \"Every region except Latin America is expected to grow strongly, through Asia-Pacific is likely to emerge as the clear leader, with a 9.8% annual growth rate. Asia-Pacific's strong growth should allow it to overtake North America in HNWI population in 2014, and in HNWI wealth by 2015.\" However, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates shared the distinction of creating new wealth at the fastest rate, with the number of HNWIs increasing by almost a quarter in both countries. Switzerland, synonymous with low taxes and banking secrecy, added 48,000 new HNWIs last year to jump to seventh place in the millionaire rankings with 330,000. With a population of just 8 million, it means one in every 24 people in the Alpine country have more than $1m of assets to invest. The analysts said the average age of the wealthy is falling steeply due to the number of new technology start-up millionaires and fortunes being split between the children of millionaire dynasties. The report claims the rich are showing increasing concern about the need to give something back and use their fortune to make a \"positive impact on society\". In the Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management survey of 4,500 HNWIs across 23 countries, 60.5% of respondents said making a positive social impact was very important or extremely important. In India, which is now home to 156,000 HNWIs, 90.5% of respondents said it was important for them to give their time or money to make a difference, compared with 60.2% in the UK and just 31.4% in Belgium. The report said while older wealthy people tend to donate to charity, younger rich people increasingly want to get involved on the ground. \"The tendency of younger HNWIs to volunteer is consistent with the observation of a number of firm executives that younger HNWIs are looking to be more hands-on, while those over 60 are more likely to focus on more traditional methods, such as charitable giving or donations made to acquire naming rights,\" the report said. King said the uber-wealthy's choice of playthings to splash their cash on has remained pretty constant with holiday homes, superyachts and private jets. But he said the richest of the rich are moving away from cautious investments like gold or cash in favour of riskier punts that they hope will enable them to make even more money. \"A focus on wealth growth instead of preservation gained ground, particularly among the ultra-HNWIs,\" the report said. \"Specifically, their preference for growth increased dramatically to 30.7% from 18% in 2013, while the focus on preservation declined from 44.8% to 27.6%.\"",

      "body": "<p>The company behind the Lidl supermarket chain is set to become western Europe's biggest grocery retailer by 2018 as discounters become mainstream across the continent.</p> <p>\"This is an unprecedented power shift in European retail fuelled by the near unstoppable growth of the discount format,\" said David Gray, author of a report compiled for Planet Retail, the consultancy firm.</p> <p>He predicts that the privately owned Schwarz Group, which is controlled by a German multibillionaire and owns Lidl together with the Kaufland hypermarket chain, will overtake French group Carrefour and Tesco to generate sales of \u20ac80bn (\u00a365bn) by 2018.</p> <p>Its current sales are around \u20ac65bn. The growth will be powered by Lidl and its fellow discounters heading into more high streets, listing more branded products and stocking more fresh food. Gray says these new avenues of growth for discounters are driving a fundamental shift in the way people shop that will outlast the economic downturn across Europe. \"This readjustment will be permanent rather than a temporary blip,\" he said.</p> <p>That shift will help Lidl's parent company grow at a rate of nearly 5% a year for the next five years. Rival group Aldi's sales, says the report, will rise by 3.5% a year. In contrast mainstream supermarkets owned by groups like Carrefour, Tesco and Asda will increase sales by less than 2% a year. As a result, Aldi will also overtake Germany's Metro Group to become western Europe's fourth biggest grocer, just behind Tesco.</p> <p>The good news for Tesco and Carrefour comes from the growth of convenience retailing, the fastest growing grocery sector where sales are expected to rise by 5.3% a year. Planet Retail's predictions emphasise the difficulties for the UK's major grocers who are already taking a hammering from discounters, led by Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>The two German retailers now control more than 8% of the \u00a3160bn UK grocery market, up from less than 7% a year ago, and their growing influence is forcing the big four supermarkets to slash prices in a bid to compete.</p> <p>All the major supermarkets lost market share last year as British shoppers were tempted either by bargains at the discounters or better quality food at upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. In a bid to compete with their smaller rivals, Morrisons last month slashed the price of 1,200 products by an average 17%, while Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have all cut the price of basic foods such as bread, milk and eggs.</p> <p>In order to fund its price cuts, Morrisons has embarked on a \u00a31bn cost-cutting programme which resulted in a decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/17/morrisons-2600-management-jobs-cut-supermarket\" title=\"\">axe 2,600 managerial jobs in stores this week</a>.</p> <p>The Morrisons job cuts follow a similar initiative from Asda, and Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said more jobs would go across the sector as supermarkets adjust to the new tough market. He suggested retailers' head office employees as well as store staff could face the chop.</p> <p>\"In a market suffering sustained weak demand and gross margin pressure, cutting the costs accordingly is the key lever available to management to support margins and profits.\"</p>",

The good news for Tesco and Carrefour comes from the growth of convenience retailing, the fastest growing grocery sector where sales are expected to rise by 5.3% a year. Planet Retail's predictions emphasise the difficulties for the UK's major grocers who are already taking a hammering from discounters, led by Aldi and Lidl. The two German retailers now control more than 8% of the \u00a3160bn UK grocery market, up from less than 7% a year ago, and their growing influence is forcing the big four supermarkets to slash prices in a bid to compete. All the major supermarkets lost market share last year as British shoppers were tempted either by bargains at the discounters or better quality food at upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. In a bid to compete with their smaller rivals, Morrisons last month slashed the price of 1,200 products by an average 17%, while Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have all cut the price of basic foods such as bread, milk and eggs. In order to fund its price cuts, Morrisons has embarked on a \u00a31bn cost-cutting programme which resulted in a decision to axe 2,600 managerial jobs in stores this week. The Morrisons job cuts follow a similar initiative from Asda, and Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said more jobs would go across the sector as supermarkets adjust to the new tough market. He suggested retailers' head office employees as well as store staff could face the chop. \"In a market suffering sustained weak demand and gross margin pressure, cutting the costs accordingly is the key lever available to management to support margins and profits.\"",

The update has prompted a 34p rise in its share price to \u00a326.73 and a buy note from Oriel Securities. Oriel analyst Chris Wickham said:</p> <blockquote> The presentation largely comprised a \"deep dive\" into the company's work on its brand portfolio. In particular, the company is doing a significant amount of work on re-organising its brands so that they are clearly structured across the group into clusters \u2013 referred to as \"houses\". <br> Imperial reiterated its focus on five global brands \u2013 Davidoff, JPS, West, Gauloises and USA Gold. In common with other global fast-moving consumer goods companies, greater use will be made of applying identical characteristics to brands \u2013 i.e. common platforms - even when names vary between countries.  As a result, the company is able to enjoy benefits from of simplification in such areas as procurement, manufacturing and marketing. In addition, they expect new initiatives to be rolled out faster.  Key Q&amp;A items covered cash conversion \u2013 expected to rise \u2013 the ability to perform in dark markets and the USA. The company reiterated its ability to perform as a branded fast-moving consumer goods company in Australia, highlighting the benefits of strong customer engagement and noted the rise in market share of JPS.  In America, the company is committed to making the business work \"as it stands.\" They highlighted the benefits of new innovations around the USA Gold brand where Glide Tech [slide open packaging] is working well.

At the meeting on Tuesday, chief executive Alison Cooper and marketing director Peter Corijn discussed the company's plans for its brands and its growth prospects. The update has prompted a 34p rise in its share price to \u00a326.73 and a buy note from Oriel Securities. Oriel analyst Chris Wickham said: The presentation largely comprised a \"deep dive\" into the company's work on its brand portfolio. In particular, the company is doing a significant amount of work on re-organising its brands so that they are clearly structured across the group into clusters \u2013 referred to as \"houses\". Imperial reiterated its focus on five global brands \u2013 Davidoff, JPS, West, Gauloises and USA Gold. In common with other global fast-moving consumer goods companies, greater use will be made of applying identical characteristics to brands \u2013 i.e. common platforms - even when names vary between countries. As a result, the company is able to enjoy benefits from of simplification in such areas as procurement, manufacturing and marketing. In addition, they expect new initiatives to be rolled out faster. Key Q&amp;A items covered cash conversion \u2013 expected to rise \u2013 the ability to perform in dark markets and the USA. The company reiterated its ability to perform as a branded fast-moving consumer goods company in Australia, highlighting the benefits of strong customer engagement and noted the rise in market share of JPS. In America, the company is committed to making the business work \"as it stands.\" They highlighted the benefits of new innovations around the USA Gold brand where Glide Tech [slide open packaging] is working well. While highlighting that this was a deep dive rather than a trading update, Imperial's presentation importantly relayed a strong message on its commitment to targeted investment, quality and growth.",
