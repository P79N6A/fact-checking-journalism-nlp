      "bodyText": "Consumers are feeling more positive about their personal financial situation but worried about the UK\u2019s overall prospects, according to July\u2019s Lloyds Bank spending power report. The monthly barometer, which tracks both spending habits and consumer confidence, found that in the weeks following the vote to leave the EU, almost 70% of consumers said they believed their own personal finance situation was either \u201cexcellent\u201d, \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201csomewhat good\u201d \u2013 the highest level since the survey started five years ago. The report, conducted in conjunction with Ipsos Mori, also found that spending on essentials such as food, drink, rent and utility bills rose for the first time since November 2014, albeit by only 0.1% on the previous year. Earlier this month the Office for National Statistics said retail sales rose 1.4% in July. Lloyds asked 2,000 adult bank customers about their current and future spending habits. The findings will comfort those who feared the Brexit vote would send the UK economy into freefall, but caution others \u2013 not least because it revealed that in July, pessimism increased markedly about the prospects for the overall UK economy. Nearly two thirds (62%) of respondents said they believed the country\u2019s financial situation was \u201cnot good\u201d or \u201cnot good at all\u201d. This compares with 55% who felt similarly negative about the wider economic outlook when asked a month earlier. People said they are also feeling less positive about the overall employment situation, with 50% of respondents now feeling \u201cnot very good\u201d or \u201cnot good at all\u201d, compared to 46% in June. The findings chime with recent forecasts of a slowdown in economic activity in the second half of 2016, which prompted the Bank of England to lower interest rates to 0.25% earlier this month. Yet despite this, three quarters of respondents remained positive about their own job security, down just 1% from June. Robin Bulloch, managing director, Lloyds Bank said: \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that people are more negative about the general economic outlook since the UK voted to leave the EU but feel more positive about their own personal circumstances. For now at least consumers seem intent on putting any fears of a wider economic slowdown to one side and carry on spending,\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Every region of the UK is better off than it was a year ago, according to a new study that found Scotland enjoyed the biggest rise in prosperity last year, beating London and several other booming English cities. Despite uncertain economic conditions during the year caused by volatile stock markets, China\u2019s slowdown and the leadup to Brexit, Barclays\u2019 latest prosperity index found that no region\u2019s overall prosperity declined last year, despite recent reports that wages have fallen for many in real terms. This study, which examines a raft of measures including average annual pay, local house prices, small business growth rates and even things like charitable giving, showed that while London continues to be the UK\u2019s most prosperous city, others are also emerging as prosperity hotspots. While the prosperity of ordinary workers has improved, the number of millionaires in the UK fell to 690,000, meaning that one in every 67 adults in the UK is now worth at least seven figures. Last year there were 715,000 millionaires across the country. After the south-east and London, eastern England hosts the largest proportion of the country\u2019s millionaires, with 148,000. Wales and the north-east are home to the fewest millionaires, each hosting 1.7% of the country\u2019s total. Scotland led the way in terms of increase in household wealth over the last year, according to the report \u2013 rising by 13%, pushing it up into seventh place overall. It narrowly beat the capital, which saw a 12% increase in prosperity last year. However it should be noted that the research was carried out before June\u2019s Brexit vote, which has since led to a cooling of the property market, particularly in London. The study will give heart to those who have talked about the boom in the northern half of the UK. It found that: Manchester and Sheffield saw some of the largest increases in small and medium-sized enterprise turnover at 15%, and 11% respectively \u2013 compared with 7% in London. Yorkshire saw the second biggest rise in the number of new businesses created with a 1.8% increase, second only to London. At an average age of 45, Manchester has the youngest business owners in the UK, compared with average age 50 in places such as Guildford and Cambridge. Leeds, Cambridge and Liverpool have the highest proportion of female entrepreneurs in UK cities \u2013 at 29%. In a sign of their status as increasingly attractive areas in which to live and work, both Bristol and Cambridge saw higher growth in house prices than London, up 14% for Cambridge and 13% for Bristol, compared with just 11% in London. Leeds came out on top for cities when it comes to increase in average earnings, rising by 6% last year, followed by Newcastle, where earnings rose by 5%. Earnings in London dropped 1% over the same period. Birmingham and the West Midlands region saw the largest growth in GDP per capita, with this rising by 12.9% in Birmingham alone, closely followed by Reading (11.3%), Manchester, and Cambridge (both 10.5%). Paul Swinney, principal economist at Centre for Cities, said: \u201cWhile it is encouraging to see some cities comparing favourably to London and the south-east on some of the key measures in the prosperity index, it is important to remember that there is still some way to go to ensure that everyone in the UK can enjoy equal levels of prosperity. \u201cA large part of this will be investment in skills, particularly in areas which are still recovering from the decline in traditional industries. The most vibrant places are those [that] have high-skilled workforces and which have focused on supporting firms and employment in the knowledge-based service sectors. \u201cBy making these issues a priority, regions across the UK can start to attract more of the industries and jobs, which offer the best prospects of long-term growth and prosperity.\u201d Akshaya Bhargava, who heads Barclays\u2019 wealth division, said: \u201cIt is particularly reassuring to see that there is strong activity throughout the whole of the UK. \u201cAs we look at the future of global trade and inward investment post-Brexit it is the success of our entrepreneurs that will help drive future prosperity \u2013 it is essential that business leaders and policymakers continue to nurture these growth areas in order to ensure that these trends continue.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2016. An earlier version said one in every 67 people in the UK was now worth at least seven figures. That has been corrected to one in 67 adults.",

      "bodyText": "Santos, one of the companies driving Queensland\u2019s liquefied natural gas export boom, is relying on price projections so optimistic that they inflate the value of the company\u2019s assets by billions of dollars, according to a leading analyst. This month Santos announced a write-down of the value of its Gladstone gas export project, GLNG, of US$1.5bn. The value of the project dropped because the price it gets for the exported gas is tied to the price of crude oil, which has dropped. But according to an analysis by the pro-renewables financial activist group Market Forces, that write-down of its assets relied on an optimistic prediction for how the oil price will change, with Santos\u2019s projections significantly higher than those of competitors Woodside and Beach Energy, brokers such as Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, as well as analysts at the World Bank. According to Santos\u2019s own explanation of how its asset\u2019s value is tied to oil prices, if it had used Goldman Sachs\u2019 projected oil prices rather than its own optimistic ones, the value of its assets would be US$3.5bn less in 2020. Alternatively, if it followed the World Bank\u2019s forecast to 2020, its assets would take more than a US$2bn hit that year. Even its peers in the market, Woodside Petroleum and Beach Energy, projected oil prices to 2021 that would result in Santos\u2019s assets taking more than a US$1bn write-down most years. Santos\u2019s write-downs have led some analysts to speculate that parts of the brand-new facility would be mothballed within a year or two. The latest company update from Goldman Sachs on Santos recommended investors sell their stock in the company, noting long-term expectations for the price of oil. Santos declined Guardian Australia\u2019s request to comment on the issue. \u201cIt just seems fanciful,\u201d said Daniel Gocher from Market Forces, who prepared the analysis. \u201cThey\u2019re a good $5 to $15 above the median forecast price per barrel. \u201cThe comparison is pretty representative \u2013 we\u2019ve got the brokers in there, and the World Bank, who you\u2019d think would be rather conservative.

Bruce Robertson from the pro-renewables financial analysis group, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said if Santos did declare a multibillion-dollar write-down, it \u201cwould be in all sorts of trouble\u201d. \u201cIn my opinion it would make financing of the business very problematic,\u201d Robertson said. He said the large discrepancy in forecasts showed Australia needed consistent reporting of the value of gas reserves and resources, as in the US. The inconsistent reporting made it hard for investors to judge the value of a company, he said, but it also made it hard for policymakers to judge how large the country\u2019s available reserves were. \u201cThere\u2019s no transparency or consistency.

      "bodyText": "A lawyer who is one of Mike Ashley\u2019s closest confidants was involved in setting up the obscure company that organises international deliveries for Sports Direct and is owned by the billionaire retailer\u2019s brother. The Financial Reporting Council, the City regulator, is looking into the agreement between Barlin Delivery Ltd and Sports Direct, which was revealed last week. Shareholders have said the arrangement casts further doubt on corporate governance at the company that Ashley controls. Public companies are required to report transactions with related parties such as family members but Sports Direct said its accountants, Grant Thornton, advised that John Ashley\u2019s ownership of Barlin did not have to be disclosed. Sports Direct told the Financial Times Barlin arranged delivery of goods worth about 6% of Sports Direct\u2019s \u00a32.9bn of revenue and that Barlin\u2019s profit was about \u00a3300,000. Companies House records show that Justin Barnes, Sports Direct\u2019s former head of brands, was the only director of Barlin Delivery from its incorporation on 6 February 2015 until 7 July 2015 when he resigned and John Ashley, Mike Ashley\u2019s older brother, became a director. Records also show Barnes has been a director of a separate company, Barlin Investments Ltd, since before 1992 and that he has been linked to other companies using the Barlin name. Barlin Investments is registered at the same address in Reigate, Surrey, that Barlin Delivery registered before changing its address to a house in Lincolnshire in October 2015. Barlin Delivery\u2019s terms and conditions on Sports Direct\u2019s website list Barlin Delivery\u2019s address as Millennium House, 99 Bell Street, Reigate. Barnes\u2019s involvement with Barlin Delivery raises fresh questions about its status as a provider of services to Sports Direct, which has been criticised by shareholders and governance experts. John Ashley is the sole owner of Barlin and was Sports Direct\u2019s IT chief until 2014. Barlin Delivery\u2019s other director is Margaret Brown, who owns the house in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, where the company is registered. Barlin arranges all international deliveries for Sports Direct by commissioning couriers such as DHL to deliver goods ordered online from outside the UK. Sports Direct said Barlin was set up on the advice of professional advisers to reduce complexity and risk for Sports Direct. Barnes, who is a trademark lawyer, was in charge of Sports Direct\u2019s brands, which include Dunlop and Slazenger, when the retailer floated in 2007 and was one of five directors who shared a \u00a325m bonus. He stopped being an employee of Sports Direct Holdings Ltd, Dunlop International and other companies linked to Sports Direct in 2008 but has continued to work for Ashley. Barnes was reported to have led Ashley\u2019s team that worked on a proposed bid for BHS this year. Ashley did not bid for BHS in the end. Barnes was also involved with Sports Direct\u2019s decision to put USC into administration and to buy the chain back back minus its debts after stripping its assets. He has represented Ashley in his dispute with Rangers FC and in June became a director of Rangers Retail Ltd when Ashley and other Sports Direct representatives resigned from the company. The club is suing Sports Direct over the joint venture, which makes Rangers about 4p for every \u00a31 fans spend at its Ibrox store. Shareholders and investor groups have said Barlin adds to concerns about how Sports Direct is run by Ashley, who is executive deputy chairman of the company he founded. Earlier this year it emerged the billionaire had put his daughter\u2019s boyfriend in charge of Sports Direct\u2019s property division, placing him in line to earn millions of pounds from deals. Sports Direct\u2019s annual report says the company\u2019s board \u201creviewed and, where appropriate, approved certain situational conflicts of interest that were reported to it by directors\u201d. It said the company keeps a register of conflicts and keeps them under review. Sports Direct holds its annual general meeting on 7 September at its head office in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. After the Guardian\u2019s revelations about treatment of employees at Shirebrook\u2019s warehouse, the company faces a revolt by shareholders other than Ashley, who owns 55%. Keith Hellawell, Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, and other directors are expected to suffer large votes against their re-election and could be voted down by minority shareholders. A resolution calling for an independent review of working practices, proposed by trade unions but opposed by Sports Direct\u2019s board, is also expected to receive the backing of some big City investors. Sports Direct and Barnes did not respond to requests for comment. No individual wrongdoing is suggested. This story was amended on 31 August to correct the number of directors who shared a \u00a325m bonus from four to five.",

    "webTitle": "Busy week of economic data gives further clues on Brexit vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There will be fresh clues on how the Brexit vote has affected households and businesses this week with new figures on consumer confidence, the housing market and the embattled manufacturing sector. Economists will be poring over the releases to get a clearer picture of the referendum\u2019s impact after indicators so far have suggested consumers shrugged off the decision to leave the EU but businesses have scaled back investment and hiring plans. The housing market has slowed in some areas but nothing has pointed to dramatic house price falls. After many indicators since the referendum have turned out stronger than economists had expected, some are reassessing their predictions that the economy would grind to a halt in the months following the Brexit vote. \u201cThe recent run of data can scarcely be described as stellar, but it has confounded some of the worst fears about how the economy would react to the referendum result,\u201d said Andrew Goodwin at the consultancy Oxford Economics. \u201cIt is still very early days in terms of gauging the impact of the referendum on the economy and much could still go wrong. But if next week\u2019s higher profile clutch of surveys for August ... follow the pattern shown by the other recent indicators then this might encourage us to upgrade our forecast for third quarter GDP growth from the flat outturn that we currently anticipate.\u201d Some economists have already raised their forecasts. IHS Markit had been expecting GDP growth of 1.6% this year, slowing to just 0.2% in 2017, but has raised its forecast to 1.9% and 0.6%. The increased optimism is largely due to the current resilience of the consumer, said Howard Archer, IHS\u2019s chief European &amp; UK economist. \u201cWe now believe that the economy is likely to achieve modest growth of around 0.2-0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter and could well dodge contraction in the fourth quarter.\u201d One key focus this week will be a consumer confidence report on Wednesday from market researchers GfK. That is expected to show households remain nervous about the economic outlook but are less gloomy than in the immediate aftermath of the referendum. The July poll had recorded the biggest slide in consumer confidence for more than 26 years, as people reported being gloomier about their own finances, the broader economy and whether now was a good time to make big purchases such as furniture and household appliances. August\u2019s headline consumer confidence reading is expected to come in at -8, up from July\u2019s -12, according to a Reuters poll of economists. That compares with -1 in the June survey carried out before the referendum. \u201cWe suspect that consumer confidence recovered some of July\u2019s sharp losses as consumers got over the initial shock of the Brexit vote,\u201d said Archer. \u201cIt is also very possible that confidence benefited in August from a feelgood factor coming from the good weather and from Team GB\u2019s strong performance in the Rio Olympics.\u201d Economists say house prices have long been a significant factor in consumer confidence in the UK and there will be fresh news on the housing market on Wednesday from the country\u2019s biggest building society. In August, economists expect Nationwide\u2019s monthly survey to show a 0.3% dip in house prices, following July\u2019s rise of 0.5% and a monthly gain of 0.2% in June. The annual growth rate is forecast to edge down to 4.5% from 5.2% in July, according to a Reuters poll. Rounding off the week are a survey of manufacturers on Thursday and a survey of construction firms on Friday. These closely watched purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) reports from data company Markit were particularly gloomy for July. The surveys\u2019 compilers said they pointed to a 0.4% drop in GDP in the July-to-September quarter, a stark contrast to growth of 0.6% in the previous three months. The manufacturing PMI index is expected to edge up to 49.0 in August from 48.2 in July, staying below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction. The construction index is expected to rise to 46.1 from 45.9 in July. The PMI report for the much bigger services sector will not be published until Monday 5 September. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec said Brexit related uncertainty hit home in the manufacturing sector in July but he expects some improvement in August, helped by stronger exports on the back of a weaker pound, which makes UK goods cheaper to overseas buyers. \u201cWe steadfastly believe that sentiment will have subsequently settled down and that purchasing activity and therefore the PMI will recover at some stage soon, albeit modestly,\u201d said Shaw. For financial markets, the main focus of the week ahead will be new US jobs data on Friday. After the US central bank chief Janet Yellen left the door open to another interest rate rise before the end of the year, traders are awaiting the US non-farm payrolls report for clues as to quite when such an increase might come. US Federal Reserve policymakers will use the report on the number of jobs added in August to gauge whether the world\u2019s biggest economy is in strong enough shape to take a rate rise as soon as September. Economists polled by Reuters expect the payrolls report to show a 180,000 gain in jobs after July\u2019s surprisingly strong gain of 255,000 jobs. Looking ahead to the jobs report, Caroline Bain and Julian Jessop at the consultancy Capital Economics said: \u201cWhile the labour market has continued to tighten, we suspect that Fed officials will want to see clear signs of a renewed acceleration in GDP growth before they green light the next rate hike,\u201d they wrote in a note to clients.",

      "bodyText": "Last week, in the lead up to the new parliament, the treasurer Scott Morrison sought to outline his economic vision. Unfortunately, rather than provide any clear ideas of where he sees the nation\u2019s economy heading, the speech was a mishmash of internal inconsistencies, statistical misreadings, and statements which made less sense the more you paid attention to them. The big take away from the speech was Morrison\u2019s desire to ape Joe Hockey\u2019s outlook of the world as being divided into two types. Where Joe Hockey talked of \u201clifters and leaners\u201d Scott Morrison has decided that \u201cthere is a new divide \u2013 the taxed and the taxed nots\u201d. Sigh. I guess then we can also say that there is a new divide in treasurers \u2013 those who simplistically view the world through ill-thought out binary oppositions, and those who don\u2019t. Morrison\u2019s shtick about net-taxpayers comes from the finding by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (Natsem) that 53% of households in Australia are net taxpayers \u2013 down from 56% in 2005. Now suggesting that this means \u201cmore Australians are ... likely today to be net beneficiaries of the government than contributors\u201d as Morrison did is dopey enough, but the treasurer went further. He argued it meant \u201con current settings, more Australians today are likely to go through their entire lives without ever paying tax than for generations\u201d. The problem is the Natsem modelling is a snapshot. It doesn\u2019t look at people\u2019s paying of tax throughout their lifetime. Morrison\u2019s use of the snapshot to suggest things about people\u2019s lifetimes would be like looking at the current unemployment rate of 5.7% and saying the rate means you have a 5.7% chance of being unemployed at some point in your life. Thus the treasurer arguing that \u201cmore Australians\u201d are \u201cnever paying more tax than they receive in government payments\u201d is a gross exaggeration. Never? Really, treasurer? The Natsem data shows the major reason for the decline in the number of net-taxpayers is the ageing population. While 53% of Australians are net-taxpayers, when you exclude those over 65 the figure rises to 67%: Of course the overall rate of net-taxpayers is falling \u2013 since the start of the century the percentage of the Australian population over 65 has gone from 12.4% to 15%. I look forward to Morrison suggesting we need to do something about those taxed-not pensioners. But no. Morrison didn\u2019t even use his assertions to make a strong case for his changes to the taxation of superannuation \u2013 clearly one area where the \u201ctaxed-not\u201d could be taxed more. All he did was meekly refer to \u201cimproving the flexibility of superannuation\u201d \u2013 a phrase so feeble that the only thing it lacks more than meaning is any conviction by Morrison towards his own policy. Rather his target is \u201creining in the growth in welfare spending\u201d. Let us not forget that the most recent data from the department of social security shows the number of those on welfare has declined over the past 15 years: And the one longitudinal study (that is, looking at how things change over the course of lifetimes) in Australia, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) Survey by the Melbourne Institute, also fails to support the treasurer\u2019s line of attack. The latest survey report for the 2013-14 financial year found that 32% of individuals aged 18\u201364 were living in a household that received income support at some stage in that year \u2013 well down on the 38% of individuals in 2001. The rest of Morrison\u2019s speech was not much better for logical strength. He spoke of some good sense about the fragilities of the Chinese economy \u2013 though when Morrison says \u201cin China, events may prove far less predictable\u201d one wonders how that stacks up against the prediction he made in parliament last year of the \u201cprosperity and jobs that [the China-Australia free-trade] agreement will deliver\u201d. But elsewhere he struggled to stay consistent. For example, he argued on the one hand that we must \u201cget debt under control by returning the budget to balance through disciplined expenditure restraint\u201d, but he later noted that \u201cwe have kept expenditure under control\u201d and yet also that \u201cexpenditure as a share of the economy remains stubbornly high\u201d. So we must restrain our spending which is under control and stubbornly high? He also suffered from having foolishly said last year in his first press conference that \u201cwe have a spending problem, not a revenue problem\u201d. Now he noted that forecasts for nominal GDP growth in the past two years were reduced from 5.25% to 2.5% due to \u201cthe reduction in the terms of trade, commodity prices, in wages and in profits\u201d. That reduction flows through to lower revenue via company and personal income tax. But Morrison cannot bring himself to admit error; thus he termed this not as a \u201crevenue problem\u201d but an \u201cearnings problem\u201d. It\u2019s a bit like saying you never called someone short, just that they lacked height. Elsewhere he demonstrated his ability to say things, which, like an M. Night Shyamalan film, collapse the moment you subject them to any thought. He agreed with \u201cthose in the banking sector who have said they believe the key to making this cultural shift is to restore banking as a profession\u201d. So banking is not a profession now, but it once was? When did it stop? And if that means something has gone wrong, why did Morrison also suggest that \u201cwe are in even better shape today when it comes to the resilience of our banking and financial system than we have ever been\u201d? So our bankers are no longer acting like professionals, and yet our banking system is in better shape today than ever before? But perhaps the biggest logical car crash came near the beginning of the speech when, after outlining that Australians are becoming too complacent and have been split into the taxed and not-taxed, he asked: \u201cAre we more interested in preserving the benefits of what the past 30 years of economic reform has given us, than relinquishing and reinvesting some of those dividends to create a stronger economy for both our own future and the generations that follow?\u201d Is Morrison actually saying we shouldn\u2019t be interested in preserving the benefits of the past 30 years of \u201creform\u201d? And if he really is saying that we need to give up \u201cthe benefits\u201d of this reform in order to create a stronger economy, that doesn\u2019t say much for the worth of all that reform. So we have had 30 years of reform which delivered benefits that now need to be relinquished so we can have a stronger economy? And what exactly are \u201cthe benefits\u201d? Is Morrison suggesting the benefit of economic reform was welfare and people being taxed-not? If that is the case, then again, doesn\u2019t that suggest the reform was basically a failure, given Morrison views welfare as a negative and decries the numbers of the taxed-not? Or is he just saying we need to give up the benefits of reform in order to have more reform in order to benefit again later on? What a scintillating sales pitch. And people wonder why voters are sceptical when they hear politicians talk about the need for reform.",

While 53% of Australians are net-taxpayers, when you exclude those over 65 the figure rises to 67%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of net taxpayers by household type (2015)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XADuQ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Of course the overall rate of net-taxpayers is falling \u2013 since the start of the century the percentage of the Australian population over 65 has gone from 12.4% to 15%.</p> <p>I look forward to Morrison suggesting we need to do something about those taxed-not pensioners. </p> <p>But no. </p> <p>Morrison didn\u2019t even use his assertions to make a strong case for his changes to the taxation of superannuation \u2013 clearly one area where the \u201ctaxed-not\u201d could be taxed more. </p> <p>All he did was meekly refer to \u201cimproving the flexibility of superannuation\u201d \u2013 a phrase so feeble that the only thing it lacks more than meaning is any conviction by Morrison towards his own policy.</p> <p>Rather his target is \u201creining in the growth in welfare spending\u201d. </p> <p>Let us not forget that the most recent data from the department of social security shows the number of those on welfare has declined over the past 15 years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of the working age population on welfare\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tSg9q/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And the one longitudinal study (that is, looking at how things change over the course of lifetimes) in Australia, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.melbourneinstitute.com/downloads/hilda/Stat_Report/statreport_2016.pdf\">the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) Survey</a> by the Melbourne Institute, also fails to support the treasurer\u2019s line of attack.</p> <p>The latest survey report for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/21/housing-affordability-inequality-and-our-flatlining-household-incomes\">2013-14 financial year</a> found that 32% of individuals aged 18\u201364 were living in a household that received income support at some stage in that year \u2013 well down on the 38% of individuals in 2001.</p> <p>The rest of Morrison\u2019s speech was not much better for logical strength.</p> <p> He spoke of some good sense about the fragilities of the Chinese economy \u2013 though when Morrison says \u201cin China, events may prove far less predictable\u201d one wonders how that stacks up against the prediction he made <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F842ee7d9-89d4-4e4f-bc93-045b018bbeb2%2F0140%22\">in parliament last year</a> of the \u201cprosperity and jobs that [the China-Australia free-trade] agreement will deliver\u201d. </p> <p>But elsewhere he struggled to stay consistent. </p> <p>For example, he argued on the one hand that we must \u201cget debt under control by returning the budget to balance through disciplined expenditure restraint\u201d, but he later noted that \u201cwe have kept expenditure under control\u201d and yet also that \u201cexpenditure as a share of the economy remains stubbornly high\u201d.</p> <p>So we must restrain our spending which is under control and stubbornly high?</p> <p>He also suffered from having foolishly said last year in <a href=\"http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/transcript/001-2015/\">his first press conference</a> that \u201cwe have a spending problem, not a revenue problem\u201d.</p> <p>Now he noted that forecasts for nominal GDP growth in the past two years were reduced from 5.25% to 2.5% due to \u201cthe reduction in the terms of trade, commodity prices, in wages and in profits\u201d.</p> <p>That reduction flows through to lower revenue via company and personal income tax. But Morrison cannot bring himself to admit error; thus he termed this not as a \u201crevenue problem\u201d but an \u201cearnings problem\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit like saying you never called someone short, just that they lacked height. </p> <p>Elsewhere he demonstrated his ability to say things, which, like an M. Night Shyamalan film, collapse the moment you subject them to any thought.</p> <p>He agreed with \u201cthose in the banking sector who have said they believe the key to making this cultural shift is to restore banking as a profession\u201d.</p> <p>So banking is not a profession now, but it once was? When did it stop? And if that means something has gone wrong, why did Morrison also suggest that \u201cwe are in even better shape today when it comes to the resilience of our banking and financial system than we have ever been\u201d?</p> <p>So our bankers are no longer acting like professionals, and yet our banking system is in better shape today than ever before?</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest logical car crash came near the beginning of the speech when, after outlining that Australians are becoming too complacent and have been split into the taxed and not-taxed, he asked:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/scott-morrison-hits-out-at-taxed-nots-and-warns-of-recession-risk\">Scott Morrison hits out at 'taxed-nots' and warns of recession risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cAre we more interested in preserving the benefits of what the past 30 years of economic reform has given us, than relinquishing and reinvesting some of those dividends to create a stronger economy for both our own future and the generations that follow?\u201d</p> <p>Is Morrison actually saying we shouldn\u2019t be interested in preserving the benefits of the past 30 years of \u201creform\u201d? </p> <p>And if he really is saying that we need to give up \u201cthe benefits\u201d of this reform in order to create a stronger economy, that doesn\u2019t say much for the worth of all that reform. So we have had 30 years of reform which delivered benefits that now need to be relinquished so we can have a stronger economy? </p> <p>And what exactly are \u201cthe benefits\u201d? Is Morrison suggesting the benefit of economic reform was welfare and people being taxed-not? If that is the case, then again, doesn\u2019t that suggest the reform was basically a failure, given Morrison views welfare as a negative and decries the numbers of the taxed-not?</p> <p>Or is he just saying we need to give up the benefits of reform in order to have more reform in order to benefit again later on?</p> <p>What a scintillating sales pitch. And people wonder why voters are sceptical when they hear politicians talk about the need for reform.</p>",
