The employee-owned retailer John Lewis, while technically not a co-op, falls under the scope of the definition used by the researchers at Co-operatives UK, the body that compiles the annual outlook for the sector. John Lewis\u2019s turnover of \u00a310.9bn in 2014 surpassed the \u00a310.8bn reported by Co-op Group, which has traditionally dominated the sector. Co-operatives UK found that the turnover of the entire sector was \u00a337bn, down 2.8% on a year earlier. It was the first year-on-year fall since the data was collected in 2006 and the result of the reduction in the Co-op Group\u2019s stake in the Co-op Bank. The Co-op Group cut its stake in the banking arm to 20% during 2014 as it scrambled to fill a hole in its books, first exposed the previous year. The capital shortfall in the Co-op Bank sparked a crisis in the Co-op Group, which slumped to a loss for 2013, and was forced to sell off parts of its business, including its farms and security company. It now focuses on supermarkets and funeral homes. The way membership of the sector is calculated has been changed by Co-operatives UK. It said the sector had almost 15 million members in 2014, which it described as a record number. In the past, Co-ops UK has said the sector had more than 15.4 million members in 2013, although this figure has since been revised to 14.4 million. Ed Mayo, secretary general of Co-operatives UK, said the sector was resilient: \u201cThe Co-operative Group is coming out of a challenging period into one of renewal, and this of course has had an impact on the sector. Yet innovation and growth amongst co-operatives large and small, in everything from solar power to social care, have meant that the co-operative sector is growing and in good health.\u201d Co-operatives UK found that Alston in Cumbria, the highest market town in England, is also home to more co-ops than any other - with a co-op baker, wholefood store, school, community owned shop and post office, broadband service and food store from the Co-operative Group. It also said that businesses that start as co-ops are more likely to survive than those that do not. Eight out of 10 businesses which began as co-ops in the last five years are still in existence, compared with four in 10 that were not set up as co-ops.",

If these reforms receive ministerial approval and are passed by the national parliament in Athens, Greece will be able to pay a bill of \u20ac1.6bn that is owed to the International Monetary Fund by next Tuesday. Taken from the 11-page document submitted by the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Monday, these are the proposals: Pension reform What Greece is offering: \u2022 Increasing national healthcare contributions \u2013 a levy paid by pensioners \u2013 to an average of 5% of pension income, up from 4% \u2022 Introducing healthcare contributions for supplementary pensions, at a rate of 5% \u2022 Raising social security contributions for supplementary pensions from 3% to 3.5% \u2022 Increasing pension contributions for those working towards retirement by 3.9%. Will it work? These are clearly defined tax-raising measures that could generate large tax receipts for the Athens exchequer. The task will be to convince Greeks who will be hit hard by extra pension contributions, albeit via the health levy. VAT What Greece is offering: \u2022The standard rate of 23% will be widened \u2022However, \u201cto protect the disposable income of low- and middle-income households\u201d there will be a reduced rate of 13% on energy, basic foods, catering and hotels \u2022 A reduced rate of 6% will be charged on medical supplies and books \u2022 In order to \u201cpromote fairness\u201d, VAT discounts for various Greek islands will end. Will it work? Higher rates for the islands are already generating protests. The higher VAT rates will do much of the heavy lifting in the new deal, raising the equivalent 0.74% of GDP, according to the document. This assumes the Greeks continue to consume at their current level, which could be over-optimistic if the economy remains in recession and the few still in employment fear for their jobs. Corporate taxes What Greece is offering: \u2022 An increase in the corporation tax rate from 26% to 29% combined with a special tax of 12% on corporate profits above \u20ac500,000. The total tax raised should be \u20ac815m in 2015. Will it work? As with all taxes, there is an assumption that the taxpayer will hang around long enough to pay up. It could be that the prospect of a brighter future for Greece attracts foreign investment, or at the very least keeps businesses in the country and paying tax. But higher taxes and a tough next few years of recession could persuade international companies to leave Greece or force domestic firms out of business, denting the expected figure for extra income. Additional measures What Greece is offering: \u2022Supplementary income tax payments imposed under the previous bailout programmes are to be raised. A \u201csolidarity supplement\u201d that starts at 1% of income and rises to 3% in addition to standard income tax rates will go up in a \u201cprogressive\u201d fashion to limit the impact on lower-income groups, raising \u20ac220m this year and \u20ac250m in 2015 \u2022In 2015 there will be \u20ac200m more shaved off the defence budget \u2022Increase the tax on luxury recreational vessels (yachts) over 10 metres-long yachts from 10% to 13%, raising an extra \u20ac47m. Will it work? The higher solidarity supplement will hurt those in work, who must pay the higher rate. This could be difficult to get past the hardline Left Platform group of Syriza MPs, who will agree to defence cuts, but may not stomach a further tax on incomes. They will agree with another strike at the defence budget, which had soared to the sixth largest in the world 10 years ago. It took some steep cuts, but is still comparatively large. A higher tax on yachts will also play well with Syriza parliamentarians.",

    "webTitle": "Greece debt crisis: Alexis Tsipras faces Athens backlash over concessions", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Greek government was under intense domestic political pressure on Tuesday night over concessions offered to creditors as eurozone finance ministers prepared to discuss a deal to stave off financial collapse in Athens. Talks between Greece and its lenders are continuing ahead of Wednesday night\u2019s ministerial gathering in Brussels, with Athens needing an agreement to make a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) payment to the International Monetary Fund due next Tuesday. However, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, faced criticism from within his coalition government over compromise proposals that will raise \u20ac8bn by increasing pensions contributions, phasing out early retirement, hiking corporation tax and raising some rates of VAT. \u201cMany MPs, be them on the left or not, are very sceptical about accepting such a programme,\u201d said Costas Lapavitsas, an economics professor at the University of London who is now an MP for Tsipras\u2019s ruling leftwing Syriza party. \u201cHow will they explain it to their voters? How will they return to their electoral constituencies and explain this agreement to them?\u201d The government\u2019s junior coalition partner, the small rightwing Independent Greeks party (Anel) deepended complications for Tsipras by warning it would only support an agreement that committed to some form of debt write-off. Greece\u2019s creditors are not expected to make such a commitment this week. Panos Kammenos, Anel\u2019s leader, said his party would oppose a proposed VAT increase for Greek islands \u201ceven if the government falls\u201d. It remained unclear on Tuesday night whether the Greek leader would be able to contain the dissent or even pass an agreement through parliament, regardless of whether a deal is reached in Brussels. Any deal that is eventually reached will have to be endorsed by a working majority in the 300-seat parliament in Athens, with a close ally of Tsipras indicating that fresh elections or a referendum might be needed if an agreement is not voted through. \u201cFor the government to forge ahead in difficult conditions after the agreement and to restart the economy and kickstart the country\u2019s productive reconstruction, it has to have a unanimous parliamentary group which will put the programme into effect,\u201d said Alekos Flambouraris, a senior government minister. Despite the backlash in Athens, there was optimism elsewhere in Europe that a deal could be reached on Wednesday. Germany\u2019s vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said a deal with Greece was possible. But he dampened expectations of debt relief, saying that a haircut for Greece would not lead anywhere if new debts are soon accumulated. Earlier on Tuesday, the European Central Bank agreed to inject nearly \u20ac1bn into the Greek banking system, the third consecutive working day that Greece has received emergency help from the ECB\u2019s emergency liquidity assistance programme to stave off bankruptcy as depositors take billions of euros out of accounts. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan, whose country has successfully completed its bailout programme and returned to growth, warned that emergency funding for Greece\u2019s banks could be cut off unless a deal is reached soon. \u201cThe new round of negotiations have a very short timeframe to be concluded satisfactorily or there is a risk that ELA will be cut off because they are bound by legal arrangements in the European Central Bank,\u201d he told the parliament in Dublin. Greece and its creditors have just days to reach an agreement that will unlock bailout funds ahead of the IMF payment due on Tuesday 30 June. Failure to pay could trigger a chaotic exit from the eurozone that both Greece and its creditors insist they are anxious to avoid. The European commission is also dangling the prospect of \u20ac35bn in financial aid for Greece if a deal is made. \u201cI want ordinary Greeks to know we are offering \u20ac35bn to help the economy,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the EU\u2019s executive arm. A commission spokeswoman said the money would come from the 2014-20 EU budget, suggesting that the money was a restatement of pre-existing funds. The commission has promised more details in the coming days. Technical experts will meet again on Wednesday ahead of the meeting of eurozone finance ministers, which is due to start at 7pm. This Eurogroup meeting will be followed by a long-scheduled summit of all 28 European Union leaders on Thursday and Friday, where a final deal could be approved. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she hoped EU leaders meeting on Thursday would only have to \u201ctake note\u201d of the Eurogroup agreement with Greece. She has been reluctant to add the Greek crisis to the packed agenda of the summit, which includes the humanitarian migrant crisis at Europe\u2019s borders and the UK\u2019s demands for EU reform. Renewed optimism among investors that Greece would avoid a chaotic default boosted stock markets on Tuesday. Greece\u2019s main index rose ended the day up more than 6%, while the French and German exchanges gained over 1.2% and 0.7% respectively. In London the FTSE 100 was flat, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei index hit a 15-year high. The mood was also lifted by unexpectedly positive data showing that eurozone factories and service industries were growing faster than many economists had thought. The Markit eurozone index rose to 54.1 in May, up from 53.6 the previous month, on a scale when anything over 50 signals expansion. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the eurozone economies were weathering the stalemate over Greece relatively well. Some analysts, however, worried that investors were getting carried away. \u201cYesterday\u2019s euphoric market reaction to the proposed new Greece debt deal seems somewhat of an overreaction to an event that on the face it will do little to resolve Greece\u2019s long-term problems, and while as yet nothing has actually been agreed,\u201d said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.

      "bodyText": "Sir Howard Davies, incoming chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, said on Tuesday that he saw his task at the bailed-out bank as ensuring that it achieved its \u201chugely important economic functions as efficiently as possible\u201d. It was initially expected that Davies would take up his boardroom role after the bank\u2019s annual general meeting at its headquarters on the outskirts of Edinburgh, but his appointment has been delayed while he finishes at the Airports Commission. As a result, he attended the AGM as a guest. Speaking before the meeting began, Davies refused to be drawn on his precise plans, but said George Osborne\u2019s announcement this month that the Treasury would start selling off its 79% stake in RBS pushed the bank into a new phase. He was hoping for an easier time as chairman than Sir Philip Hampton, who faced robust questions at the AGM. \u201cHampton and his team have done a lot of the heavy lifting, so I\u2019m hoping that the next five years will be easier than the last five years,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to do. The chancellor\u2019s statement moves [the bank] into a new phase.\u201d Davies confirmed that his start had been postponed because of a delay in publishing his report on expanding London\u2019s airports, which was due to be published last week, due to the unexpected need to carry out air-quality consultations. That report was due to be published \u201cfairly soon\u201d, he said. \u201cI had always intended to join the bank after I had published the report.\u201d Hampton, who is to become chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, told Reuters that selling off the government\u2019s stake would take \u201ctake several years\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve long thought the process should have started,\u201d said Hampton, who joined the bank in January 2009, when shares were trading at the equivalent of 90p. They closed last night at 359.5p, still below the 502p average price that taxpayers paid for them. At the meeting, activist shareholders repeatedly accused Hampton of incompetence during his tenure. Joel Benjamin, a campaigner with Moveyourmoneyuk, accused RBS of \u201ccallous contempt\u201d by charging local councils unduly high commercial interest rates on loans. These were often more than double the 3% interest charged by the public works loan board. Benjamin said Edinburgh council\u2019s debts to RBS would cost it \u00a3110m in interest payments alone. Hampton retorted that banks would need to offer competitive rates of interest to win business, not overcharge, and had no reason to single out local councils. Rates of interest depended on the creditworthiness of the customer, he added. Hampton also admitted the bank had been wrong to make a pledge to keep open branches in 2010, since when branch usage had fallen 36%. Chief executive Ross McEwan insisted that RBS is still on track to float its Williams &amp; Glyn arm on the stockmarket in the final quarter of 2016, rejecting reports that unexpected delays were slowing down the task of hiving off the bank. It was, he said, \u201ca very, very difficult piece of work, but we have over 4,000 members of staff working to get that business out and our endeavour is still to get it out by the second half of next year.\u201d He added that a more precise target for floating Williams &amp; Glyn was the final quarter of 2016, and would meet all the requirements \u201csent down by the EU\u201d. The crisis last week over RBS\u2019s IT systems, which left 600,000 customers unable to withdraw money for several days, was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d, McEwan added.",

      "bodyText": "Black Americans were unequally issued loans on unfavorable terms during the sub-prime loan bonanza that prefigured the housing crisis and are still suffering in its aftermath, a new report from the American Civil Liberties Union has found. The resulting economic downturn has adversely affected them to a much greater degree than white homeowners, said the ACLU\u2019s Rachel Goodman, who said the findings suggest banks knowingly preyed on black mortgage-seekers when it came to issuing sub-prime mortgages. \u201cRace must have been a factor somewhere in the decision-making, because it otherwise doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u201d Goodman said. Goodman pointed out that the report differs significantly from other studies of wealth by race, in that it compares people who are all homeowners and thus presumably fit some definition of \u201cmiddle class\u201d. Goodman said the black families in the study, which surveyed 3,000 households (741 of them black), had been subjected to \u201credlining\u201d \u2013 denying or charging more for necessary services \u2013 loans to people in historically black neighborhoods, which made the residents of those neighborhoods particularly susceptible to predation by fly-by-night mortgage outfits pushing sub-prime loans so they could turn them around on the then-booming secondary market. \u201cTraditional banks are less likely to be set up and pushing better credit options to those families,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just taking advantage of a kind of vacuum.\u201d The report\u2019s executive summary cited the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on the topic, observing that the disparity between mortgage holders varied dramatically by race and had seemingly nothing to do with wealth. \u201cBorrowers in upper-income black neighborhoods were twice as likely as homeowners in low-income white neighborhoods to refinance with a sub-prime loan,\u201d the HUD report said. The ACLU doesn\u2019t have specific policy recommendations out of the report, but Goodman did say that some loan market regulation currently being pushed back against by the banks had the potential to help black borrowers. The Qualified Mortgage (QM) standard, a part of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (a section of the Dodd-Frank Act) sets a high bar for a mortgage that can be turned around and made into part of a security the way sub-prime loans were before the crisis. Bankers have said specifically that this will keep them from lending to black and Hispanic loan-seekers, since those people have been disproportionately affected by the housing crisis and now have lower incomes. Goodman isn\u2019t convinced. \u201cWe think that\u2019s a really false argument,\u201d she said. It\u2019s only onerous to issue loans to poor people if you insist on terms those borrowers can never meet. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s impossible to issue safe loans, it\u2019s that if you are invested in taking shortcuts, maybe this is a little difficult.\u201d",

Goodman pointed out that the report differs significantly from other studies of wealth by race, in that it compares people who are all homeowners and thus presumably fit some definition of \u201cmiddle class\u201d.<br></p> <p>Goodman said the black families in the study, which surveyed 3,000 households (741 of them black), had been subjected to \u201credlining\u201d \u2013 denying or charging more for necessary services \u2013 loans to people in historically black neighborhoods, which made the residents of those neighborhoods particularly susceptible to predation by fly-by-night mortgage outfits pushing sub-prime loans so they could turn them around on the then-booming secondary market.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cTraditional banks are less likely to be set up and pushing better credit options to those families,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just taking advantage of a kind of vacuum.\u201d<br></p> <p>The report\u2019s executive summary cited the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on the topic, observing that the disparity between mortgage holders varied dramatically by race and had seemingly nothing to do with wealth.</p> <p>\u201cBorrowers in upper-income black neighborhoods were twice as likely as homeowners in low-income white neighborhoods to refinance with a sub-prime loan,\u201d the HUD report said.<br></p> <p>The ACLU doesn\u2019t have specific policy recommendations out of the report, but Goodman did say that some loan market regulation currently being pushed back against by the banks had the potential to help black borrowers. The Qualified Mortgage (QM) standard, a part of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (a section of the Dodd-Frank Act) sets a high bar for a mortgage that can be turned around and made into part of a security the way sub-prime loans were before the crisis.<br></p> <p>Bankers <a href=\"http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/dailybriefing/blacks-and-hispanics-likely-to-be-hurt-by-qualified-mortgage-rule-1039521-1.html\">have said specifically</a> that this will keep them from lending to black and Hispanic loan-seekers, since those people have been disproportionately affected by the housing crisis and now have lower incomes.<br></p> <p>Goodman isn\u2019t convinced. \u201cWe think that\u2019s a really false argument,\u201d she said. It\u2019s only onerous to issue loans to poor people if you insist on terms those borrowers can never meet. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s impossible to issue safe loans, it\u2019s that if you are invested in taking shortcuts, maybe this is a little difficult.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The most senior bankers in the City may have to wait 10 years before they can be sure that their bonuses will not be clawed back, as a result of a series of measures intended to rebuild public trust in the financial services industry. However, outlining their proposals on Tuesday, the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority backed down from preventing bankers from buying out bonuses that new recruits forego by leaving their previous employers. The regulators considered the move to stop bankers walking away from their jobs before any problems \u2013 such as rigging Libor or foreign exchange markets \u2013 were uncovered. The regulators are also sparing thousands of less senior bankers from potentially more draconian deferral periods, stepping back from requiring staff to have bonuses paid out over five years. From next year, any firm subject to an investigation into wrongdoing must put the bonuses of their top bosses at risk of being clawed back for 10 years. The timescale was suggested by the parliamentary commission on banking standards following the Libor-rigging scandal in 2012. Less senior bankers are subject to a seven-year clawback period, already in place. Non-executive directors will not be able to receive bonuses \u2013 already regarded as standard practice. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chaired the commission, said: \u201cIn the last crisis, many people walked away from the mess that they had created with huge rewards, well before the risks matured and it became clear that the rewards were not merited. These proposals will be judged by whether they can help prevent this happening again.\u201d Tyrie, who was reinstated as chair of the Treasury select committee after the May general election, added: \u201cThe regulators\u2019 plans to lengthen deferral and clawback periods are a step forward. But the regulators themselves identified that attempts to manipulate the foreign exchange markets dated back to January 2008 \u2013 over seven years ago \u2013 when recently fining the banks. There remains a need, in a minority of cases, for even longer deferral.\u201d Three tiers of employees are effectively being created: the senior managers subjected to 10-year clawback; the managers whose bonuses must be deferred for five years; and less senior staff whose bonuses are deferred between three and five years. . The 10-year period for top bankers will only kick in if their firm comes under a regulatory investigation. Martin Wheatley, head of the FCA, said: \u201cOur rules will now mean that senior managers face clawback of bonuses for up to 10 years, if misconduct comes to light. This is a crucial step to rebuild public trust in financial services, and allows firms and regulators to build long term decision making and effective risk management into people\u2019s pay packets.\u201d During the consultation period, the regulators had been warned that if deferral periods were too long, salaries may become inflated \u2013 a consequence that watchdogs were keen to avoid. Regulators have been concerned that the EU\u2019s cap on bonuses, which limits payouts to no more than salaries \u2013 or double if shareholders approve \u2013 has also inflated pay levels. Oliver Parry, senior corporate governance adviser at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cToday marks a significant milestone in overhauling pay practices in the City following the crisis of 2008. The era of rewards for failure along the lines of [former Royal Bank of Scotland boss] Fred Goodwin must be buried once and for all.\u201d However, remuneration experts warned that salaries would rise and the City\u2019s competitiveness damaged. Jon Terry, partner and pay expert at PwC, said: \u201cAlthough the [Prudential Regulation Authority] says they don\u2019t want this to happen, it is likely that British banks will need to pay a premium to attract senior executives outside the UK, and more in fixed pay than their foreign competitors.\u201d",

So after touching 6856 the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> lost some of its early gains to close up just 9.20 points at 6834.87. German and French markets fared better, up 0.7% and 1% respectively, while the Athens market jumped another 6.11%.</p> <p>Meanwhile, away from Greece, Federal Reserve official Jerome Powell said he was forecasting two US interest rate rises this year, in September and December, comments which sent the dollar higher and also took some of the edge off equities.</p> <p>The day\u2019s biggest FTSE 100 riser was <strong>Sports Direct International,</strong> up 22.5p at 725p after a positive note from RBC. Analyst Richard Chamberlain said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think that the introduction of a click and collect offer has boosted sales for Sports Retail and USC stores. Sports Direct has also improved its online offer in other ways, eg through a \u201cfast-pay\u201d checkout solution. This should help to differentiate Sports Direct from other discounters. Although we think click and collect is margin dilutive, Sports Direct is protecting its margin through charging for online services and overall margin should continue to rise in 2016 owing to a higher weighting of higher priced own label product.</p> <p>The integration of Austria is taking longer than originally anticipated as the business model has had to be rebuilt and as we think Sports Direct will take a while to change the culture and business practices of the business. Also Sports Direct\u2019s own brands are less well known in mainland Europe and the weaker euro versus the pound will act as a headwind on sales in the short term. However, we expect a gradual improvement and Sports Direct has easy trading comparisons coming up this Winter.</p> <p>Sports Direct\u2019s leverage ratios are below average for the sector and this provides it with scope to either commence dividend payments or to drive higher earnings per share growth through further acquisitions. </p> <p>Majority shareholder Mike Ashley owns 55% of Sports Direct\u2019s shares, which brings with it all the pros and cons of investing in a company with a dominant shareholder.</p> <p>On the one hand, Sports Direct has an entrepreneurial culture and a strong and highly incentivized management team. We would expect Mr Ashley to take operational decisions for the long-term benefit of the business.</p> <p>On the other hand, shareholders have to be prepared for sudden changes in strategic direction occasionally, including strategic stake holdings in related companies.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Johnson Matthey</strong> jumped 67p to \u00a332.20 after Citgroup moved from neutral to buy and raised its target price from \u00a332 to \u00a336. The bank said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We see current valuations of Johnson Matthey as an attractive entry point; it is trading near its long term average PE despite solid earnings potential and sweet spot cycle for its key business: emission catalysts. </p> </blockquote> <p>But distribution group <strong>Bunzl </strong>fell 39p to \u00a318.52 on signs of slowing growth - especially in North America - and the prospect of a continuing acquisition spree.<br></p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Ladbrokes</strong> was lifted 17.9p to 140p by news of a proposed merger with Gala Coral.<br></p> <p>Russian steel group <strong>Evraz</strong> dropped 7.1p to 139.7p after UBS cut its target price from 170p to 130p and issued a sell rating, while <strong>Mitchells &amp; Butlers </strong>fell 9.6p to 465.7p as Barclays moved from overweight to equal weight. Barclays said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have argued over the past few years that the quality of the M&amp;B estate has been inconsistent with the valuation. With the shares edging up to our price target, we believe the re-rating relative to peers is close to complete.</p> <p>Much has improved from a corporate governance perspective, and under chairman Bob Ivell, chief executive Alistair Darby has been in place since 2012, a number of independent non-execs have been appointed, and there has been no obvious disagreement between the company and its major shareholders. There have also been some signs of operational improvements, such as food volume growth. The December 2016 PE of 11.3 times looks undemanding in absolute terms, but we believe operational improvements are now required before arguing for a further re-rating.</p> </blockquote>",

So after touching 6856 the FTSE 100 lost some of its early gains to close up just 9.20 points at 6834.87. German and French markets fared better, up 0.7% and 1% respectively, while the Athens market jumped another 6.11%. Meanwhile, away from Greece, Federal Reserve official Jerome Powell said he was forecasting two US interest rate rises this year, in September and December, comments which sent the dollar higher and also took some of the edge off equities. The day\u2019s biggest FTSE 100 riser was Sports Direct International, up 22.5p at 725p after a positive note from RBC. Analyst Richard Chamberlain said: We think that the introduction of a click and collect offer has boosted sales for Sports Retail and USC stores. Sports Direct has also improved its online offer in other ways, eg through a \u201cfast-pay\u201d checkout solution. This should help to differentiate Sports Direct from other discounters. Although we think click and collect is margin dilutive, Sports Direct is protecting its margin through charging for online services and overall margin should continue to rise in 2016 owing to a higher weighting of higher priced own label product. The integration of Austria is taking longer than originally anticipated as the business model has had to be rebuilt and as we think Sports Direct will take a while to change the culture and business practices of the business. Also Sports Direct\u2019s own brands are less well known in mainland Europe and the weaker euro versus the pound will act as a headwind on sales in the short term. However, we expect a gradual improvement and Sports Direct has easy trading comparisons coming up this Winter. Sports Direct\u2019s leverage ratios are below average for the sector and this provides it with scope to either commence dividend payments or to drive higher earnings per share growth through further acquisitions. Majority shareholder Mike Ashley owns 55% of Sports Direct\u2019s shares, which brings with it all the pros and cons of investing in a company with a dominant shareholder. On the one hand, Sports Direct has an entrepreneurial culture and a strong and highly incentivized management team. We would expect Mr Ashley to take operational decisions for the long-term benefit of the business. On the other hand, shareholders have to be prepared for sudden changes in strategic direction occasionally, including strategic stake holdings in related companies. Johnson Matthey jumped 67p to \u00a332.20 after Citgroup moved from neutral to buy and raised its target price from \u00a332 to \u00a336. The bank said: We see current valuations of Johnson Matthey as an attractive entry point; it is trading near its long term average PE despite solid earnings potential and sweet spot cycle for its key business: emission catalysts. But distribution group Bunzl fell 39p to \u00a318.52 on signs of slowing growth - especially in North America - and the prospect of a continuing acquisition spree. Among the mid-caps Ladbrokes was lifted 17.9p to 140p by news of a proposed merger with Gala Coral. Russian steel group Evraz dropped 7.1p to 139.7p after UBS cut its target price from 170p to 130p and issued a sell rating, while Mitchells &amp; Butlers fell 9.6p to 465.7p as Barclays moved from overweight to equal weight. Barclays said: We have argued over the past few years that the quality of the M&amp;B estate has been inconsistent with the valuation. With the shares edging up to our price target, we believe the re-rating relative to peers is close to complete. Much has improved from a corporate governance perspective, and under chairman Bob Ivell, chief executive Alistair Darby has been in place since 2012, a number of independent non-execs have been appointed, and there has been no obvious disagreement between the company and its major shareholders. There have also been some signs of operational improvements, such as food volume growth. The December 2016 PE of 11.3 times looks undemanding in absolute terms, but we believe operational improvements are now required before arguing for a further re-rating.",

      "bodyText": "The scandal which enveloped the Co-operative Bank was reawakened on Tuesday when the bank revealed it was facing fines from City regulators over the events that led to its near collapse two years ago. The bank is now just 20% owned by the Co-operative Group of supermarkets and funeral homes after an emergency fundraising was required to plug a \u00a31.5bn shortfall uncovered in 2013. Control passed to hedge funds and other private investors after the rescue. On Tuesday, the bank said it would begin settlement talks next month with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England concerning events between 2008 and 2013. \u201cThe outcome of any settlement discussions is currently uncertain both in the details of any findings and any potential financial penalty,\u201d the bank said. No details of the scale of any fines have been discussed with the FCA or the Bank of England\u2019s regulation arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority. The regulators have powers to fine institutions and individuals, who could also be banned from working in the City. \u201cFCA and PRA have recently indicated that their preliminary view is that they are minded to make findings against the bank covering certain decisions, events and processes over the period from mid-2008 to end-2013. Based on their current view, the FCA and PRA have indicated they intend to commence formal settlement discussions in July 2015,\u201d the bank said. The problems inside the Co-op Bank led to a series of a parliamentary hearings and official reports by the bank and the wider Co-op Group into what went wrong. A report by Sir Christopher Kelly, a former top civil servant, published in April last year pointed to poor management, bad lending, a flawed culture and an overambitious drive for growth in the years up to the discovery of the capital shortfall. He also concluded that the bank should never have merged with the Britannia Building Society in 2009, just as the banking crisis was talking hold. The PRA declined to comment on the Co-op\u2019s statement but in January last year the regulator revealed it had started an investigation into the bank and the \u201crole of former senior managers\u201d. Those individuals have not been named. At one of the parliamentary hearings into the failings at the Co-op bank, the former chairman Paul Flowers, who was also a Methodist minister, was unable to tell the Treasury select committee the size of the bank\u2019s balance sheet. Flowers later pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine at Leeds magistrates court after an expos\u00e9 by the Mail on Sunday. The Treasury committee \u2013 which was investigating the collapse of the Co-op bank\u2019s attempt to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 also took evidence from regulators and other former members of the bank\u2019s management team. The announcement from the Co-op bank about the impending settlement talks is the first update on the ongoing investigations since the PRA and FCA first admitted inquiries were underway in January last year. There was no update on an investigation by the Financial Reporting Council into the accounts, which were audited by KPMG. Once the outcome of the PRA and FCA investigations are known, the government will face pressure to see through its pledge to commission an independent investigation into what went wrong at the bank. If the PRA does take action against the Co-op bank it will be only the second time it has used its new powers to fine banks. The first time it issued a financial penalty was in November when it hit Royal Bank of Scotland with a \u00a314m fine related to its IT failures in 2012. New management has since been installed at the Co-op bank. The new boss Niall Booker said: \u201cThe bank has been co-operating fully with the regulatory authorities. The risks of any adverse findings and penalties relating to these past events have been highlighted on multiple occasions previously. We will provide a further update as and when appropriate.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As the \u201ceverything store\u201d, it was never going to stop at books. Founded by Jeff Bezos with the aim of being the one-stop shop for the world, Amazon now sells 120m different items. </p> <p>Alongside the stacks of paperbacks in its warehouses are CDs, DVDs, TVs, iPads, iPods, toys, clothing \u2013 but also the less obvious: jewellery, washing machines, garden furniture, windscreen wipers, bonsai trees, doubles basses, boomerangs, pet headstones, inflatable walking sticks, a One Direction onesie.</p> <p>Millions of these items are sold not by Amazon itself but by legions of independent sellers. For the e-tailer\u2019s UK operation, these third-party sellers include well-known chains such as Debenhams and Clarks, but also small traders working from their own shop, warehouse, or kitchen table. <br></p> <p>The idea of inviting competitors on to Amazon.com provoked consternation at the company when Bezos launched Marketplace \u2013 an operation for third-party vendors \u2013 in 2000. Independents now sell 44% of all items on Amazon worldwide and their sales are growing faster than those of the host site.<br></p> <p>But for the head of Amazon\u2019s third-party operation in Britain, it is a necessary part of meeting Bezos\u2019s vaulting ambition. \u201cWe want to be a place where customers can find and buy everything and our sellers are helping us get there,\u201d says Chris Poad, director of seller services in the UK. As if reading from the Bezos playbook of sanctifying the customer, Poad says Amazon is \u201cgood for the entire population\u201d, by enabling people to spend less on buying the things they need.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24b453837ecfaed6519f6cce30b52ceb43ad1722\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b453837ecfaed6519f6cce30b52ceb43ad1722/64_672_2731_1639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Bezos at a press conference in New York in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Bezos at a press conference in New York in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is this overwhelming focus on the customer and the price that has given Amazon a reputation as a hard-nosed business \u2013 particularly over its tax affairs. It has been criticised for channeling almost all of its European sales, with the resulting profits, through Luxembourg. This practice ended last month as Amazon acted in anticipation of a raft of tax reforms from the UK, EU and G20 designed to stamp out aggressive tax planning. Meanwhile, arrangements that allow it to shift profits out of Luxembourg are under investigation separately by EU competition regulators who believe they could amount to illegal state aid. <br></p> <p>For Poad, nonetheless, the focus stays the same. \u201cThere is a universal fundamental truth that customers want low prices.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon does not reveal exactly how much its sellers make on the site but trumpets the fact that the number of UK sellers earning more than \u00a31m in revenues increased by 33% last year. British sellers also earned more than \u00a31bn from selling goods abroad.<br></p> <p>Amazon\u2019s giant internet footprint puts sellers in touch with millions of customers they could not hope to find alone \u2013 the online retailer is  one of the world\u2019s most-visited websites. But such exposure comes at a price: in seeking a foothold in the digital marketplace, independents find themselves competing with the biggest seller of all \u2013 Amazon itself.</p> <p><br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/05/love-amazon-hate-necessary-evil\">'I love Amazon and I hate Amazon, they're a necessary evil'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAmazon is a big beast that is trading on its own behalf as well as offering small and medium-sized retailers a shop in their store,\u201d said James Dunford-Wood, from e-commerce data specialist Ometria.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere is no guarantee they won\u2019t take advantage, and in some cases they probably have. They can sell on their own account and they can see what is selling and what is not and that puts [Amazon] in a powerful position.\u201d<br></p> <p>Nevertheless, he added, Amazon has to tread carefully because it needs the support of retailers. \u201cThey do provide a new marketplace and provide access to a very big audience of shoppers, so maybe it is a quid pro quo.\u201d<br></p> <p>Independent retailers selling through Amazon gave a mixed view of the relationship. Mighty Oak Trading, an online pet-care business run by Geoffrey Hayne and his wife Helen, pays 10-15% commission on every sale via Amazon\u2019s website. \u201cI am not happy with it [the rate], but you do get a constant stream of millions of users, you are paying for those millions,\u201d Hayne said.</p> <p>Amazon is their shop window and a far bigger source of revenues than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/ebay\">eBay</a>, where they used to sell most of their goods. But Hayne thinks Amazon is \u201cmore difficult\u201d than eBay, because \u201cyou are competing with sellers and Amazon\u201d. \u201cIf we find a nice product that starts selling well, you can bet that within six months Amazon will start selling it and undercut us.\u201d</p> <p>He is phlegmatic about this. \u201cIt is just a fact of life. We don\u2019t have to sell on Amazon, but we choose to.\u201d<br></p> <p>High street retailers also have mixed feelings about being part of Amazon\u2019s empire. \u201cIn an ideal world every retailer would rather sell directly to the consumer themselves,\u201d said Stephen Palmer, of TV Village \u2013 an electronics retailer in Aberfoyle, Stirling, which sells half its products via online platforms. \u201cThe Amazon platform gives us a chance of exposure to a wider audience so Amazon is a good thing in the main. But Amazon is a big beast and you could argue its commissions are high.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to be a modern retailer starting today</p> <footer> <cite>Craig Shuff</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Craig Shuff also sounds ambivalent. He is the manager of Swinnerton Cycles, a family-owned bike shop that has been in Stoke-on-Trent for 100 years. Swinnertons does not make any money on Amazon: it sells on the site at cost, as a form of advertising.</p> <p>\u201c[Amazon] is good in that it enables you to compete with the big boys. We haven\u2019t got thousands to put into advertising every week or month whereas Amazon do a lot of that for you,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>But he has seen retailers go under in a doomed effort to compete. \u201cThe problem is when you start trying to compete on price. You are suddenly running around like headless chickens and you don\u2019t make any money. We have seen businesses that have tried [to compete] go under.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ajay Bhalla, a professor at Cass business school, says selling on Amazon can be \u201ca race to the bottom, unless you have a very unique product\u201d. He views many Amazon sellers as the heirs to flea-market traders, who would struggle to create a bricks-and-mortar business.<br></p> <p>Judith Blackford, the founder of online toy retailer Kiddymania, agrees that sellers face fierce competition. \u201cYou have Amazon Prime [unlimited \u2018free\u2019 one-day-delivery for an annual fee]; you have Amazon One Click [instant ordering]. You can\u2019t compete with all of that. There can be half a dozen [sellers] and everybody is trying to get into the buy box.\u201d<br></p> <p>Some Amazon executives once feared this relentless pressure, as one former executive told Brad Stone, the author of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/books/the-everything-store-jeff-bezos-and-the-age-of-amazon.html?_r=0\">The Everything Store</a>: \u201cImagine you are the guy on the hook for a zillion dollars worth of inventory. And this lunatic comes over putting low-price crap on your page. You can bet that leads to some squabbles.\u201d</p> <p>These days, Amazon argues that price competition is good for everyone. \u201cI would never apologise for the fact that part of Amazon competes with our sellers,\u201d Poad says. \u201cI think competition raises standards, it forces both Amazon and sellers to raise their game. Amazon is just a seller; it happens to be the biggest seller.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f578e1ca73c9b754a311b142c222518a7ac67b17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f578e1ca73c9b754a311b142c222518a7ac67b17/987_0_2613_1569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Amazon fulfilment centre just outside Peterborough in the UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Amazon fulfilment centre just outside Peterborough in the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Yates/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But not everyone is convinced.

      "bodyText": "As the \u201ceverything store\u201d, it was never going to stop at books. Founded by Jeff Bezos with the aim of being the one-stop shop for the world, Amazon now sells 120m different items. Alongside the stacks of paperbacks in its warehouses are CDs, DVDs, TVs, iPads, iPods, toys, clothing \u2013 but also the less obvious: jewellery, washing machines, garden furniture, windscreen wipers, bonsai trees, doubles basses, boomerangs, pet headstones, inflatable walking sticks, a One Direction onesie. Millions of these items are sold not by Amazon itself but by legions of independent sellers. For the e-tailer\u2019s UK operation, these third-party sellers include well-known chains such as Debenhams and Clarks, but also small traders working from their own shop, warehouse, or kitchen table. The idea of inviting competitors on to Amazon.com provoked consternation at the company when Bezos launched Marketplace \u2013 an operation for third-party vendors \u2013 in 2000. Independents now sell 44% of all items on Amazon worldwide and their sales are growing faster than those of the host site. But for the head of Amazon\u2019s third-party operation in Britain, it is a necessary part of meeting Bezos\u2019s vaulting ambition. \u201cWe want to be a place where customers can find and buy everything and our sellers are helping us get there,\u201d says Chris Poad, director of seller services in the UK. As if reading from the Bezos playbook of sanctifying the customer, Poad says Amazon is \u201cgood for the entire population\u201d, by enabling people to spend less on buying the things they need. It is this overwhelming focus on the customer and the price that has given Amazon a reputation as a hard-nosed business \u2013 particularly over its tax affairs. It has been criticised for channeling almost all of its European sales, with the resulting profits, through Luxembourg. This practice ended last month as Amazon acted in anticipation of a raft of tax reforms from the UK, EU and G20 designed to stamp out aggressive tax planning. Meanwhile, arrangements that allow it to shift profits out of Luxembourg are under investigation separately by EU competition regulators who believe they could amount to illegal state aid. For Poad, nonetheless, the focus stays the same. \u201cThere is a universal fundamental truth that customers want low prices.\u201d Amazon does not reveal exactly how much its sellers make on the site but trumpets the fact that the number of UK sellers earning more than \u00a31m in revenues increased by 33% last year. British sellers also earned more than \u00a31bn from selling goods abroad. Amazon\u2019s giant internet footprint puts sellers in touch with millions of customers they could not hope to find alone \u2013 the online retailer is one of the world\u2019s most-visited websites. But such exposure comes at a price: in seeking a foothold in the digital marketplace, independents find themselves competing with the biggest seller of all \u2013 Amazon itself. \u201cAmazon is a big beast that is trading on its own behalf as well as offering small and medium-sized retailers a shop in their store,\u201d said James Dunford-Wood, from e-commerce data specialist Ometria. \u201cThere is no guarantee they won\u2019t take advantage, and in some cases they probably have. They can sell on their own account and they can see what is selling and what is not and that puts [Amazon] in a powerful position.\u201d Nevertheless, he added, Amazon has to tread carefully because it needs the support of retailers. \u201cThey do provide a new marketplace and provide access to a very big audience of shoppers, so maybe it is a quid pro quo.\u201d Independent retailers selling through Amazon gave a mixed view of the relationship. Mighty Oak Trading, an online pet-care business run by Geoffrey Hayne and his wife Helen, pays 10-15% commission on every sale via Amazon\u2019s website. \u201cI am not happy with it [the rate], but you do get a constant stream of millions of users, you are paying for those millions,\u201d Hayne said. Amazon is their shop window and a far bigger source of revenues than eBay, where they used to sell most of their goods. But Hayne thinks Amazon is \u201cmore difficult\u201d than eBay, because \u201cyou are competing with sellers and Amazon\u201d. \u201cIf we find a nice product that starts selling well, you can bet that within six months Amazon will start selling it and undercut us.\u201d He is phlegmatic about this. \u201cIt is just a fact of life. We don\u2019t have to sell on Amazon, but we choose to.\u201d High street retailers also have mixed feelings about being part of Amazon\u2019s empire. \u201cIn an ideal world every retailer would rather sell directly to the consumer themselves,\u201d said Stephen Palmer, of TV Village \u2013 an electronics retailer in Aberfoyle, Stirling, which sells half its products via online platforms. \u201cThe Amazon platform gives us a chance of exposure to a wider audience so Amazon is a good thing in the main. But Amazon is a big beast and you could argue its commissions are high.\u201d Craig Shuff also sounds ambivalent. He is the manager of Swinnerton Cycles, a family-owned bike shop that has been in Stoke-on-Trent for 100 years. Swinnertons does not make any money on Amazon: it sells on the site at cost, as a form of advertising. \u201c[Amazon] is good in that it enables you to compete with the big boys. We haven\u2019t got thousands to put into advertising every week or month whereas Amazon do a lot of that for you,\u201d he said. But he has seen retailers go under in a doomed effort to compete. \u201cThe problem is when you start trying to compete on price. You are suddenly running around like headless chickens and you don\u2019t make any money. We have seen businesses that have tried [to compete] go under.\u201d Ajay Bhalla, a professor at Cass business school, says selling on Amazon can be \u201ca race to the bottom, unless you have a very unique product\u201d. He views many Amazon sellers as the heirs to flea-market traders, who would struggle to create a bricks-and-mortar business. Judith Blackford, the founder of online toy retailer Kiddymania, agrees that sellers face fierce competition. \u201cYou have Amazon Prime [unlimited \u2018free\u2019 one-day-delivery for an annual fee]; you have Amazon One Click [instant ordering]. You can\u2019t compete with all of that. There can be half a dozen [sellers] and everybody is trying to get into the buy box.\u201d Some Amazon executives once feared this relentless pressure, as one former executive told Brad Stone, the author of The Everything Store: \u201cImagine you are the guy on the hook for a zillion dollars worth of inventory. And this lunatic comes over putting low-price crap on your page. You can bet that leads to some squabbles.\u201d These days, Amazon argues that price competition is good for everyone. \u201cI would never apologise for the fact that part of Amazon competes with our sellers,\u201d Poad says. \u201cI think competition raises standards, it forces both Amazon and sellers to raise their game. Amazon is just a seller; it happens to be the biggest seller.\u201d But not everyone is convinced. Dunford-Wood points out that Amazon has the advantage of \u201ca lot of interesting and powerful data\u201d, such as customers\u2019 email addresses and their pre-purchase browsing history. The data is not available to its Marketplace sellers. \u201cThe big challenge for retailers is not just to win a first-time customer, but to turn that person into a loyal customer. If you don\u2019t have a means to communicate with them \u2013 bar the absolute minimum \u2013 it handicaps you in creating a relationship.\u201d Poad insists Amazon is \u201coverwhelmingly a good thing for the British economy and society\u201d and has created \u201ctens of thousands of jobs\u201d. \u201cI am very confident we have helped [create] tens of thousands of new jobs, maybe more, because we have helped those small businesses grow by allowing them access to customers they wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise.\u201d Geraint Johnes, an associate of the Work Foundation and an economics professor at Lancaster University, says it is inaccurate to say Amazon has been responsible for creating all the businesses using Marketplace. He said: \u201cMany of the small businesses that trade on Marketplace are using the facility as an additional form of exposure \u2013 and they would have been in business anyway without Amazon. \u201cOf the other businesses using Marketplace, many represent part-time employment for a sole trader, often taking the form of a second job. Depending on your perspective, this might represent a valuable enabler for people wishing to pursue portfolio careers, or it may reflect a socially damaging increase in job insecurity.\u201d As in any market, sellers have ups and downs. Blackford is winding down her Kiddymania business, a decision brought about by changing personal circumstances, the recession and a software glitch that caused some goods advertised on Amazon to be sold for pennies after a price crash. Blackford stressed she does not hold Amazon responsible for the error, which was caused by another company\u2019s software.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ladbrokes and Gala Coral are in merger talks to create Britain\u2019s largest bookmaker measured by number of betting shops. The combined company would have a chain of more than 4,000 betting offices, leapfrogging market leader William Hill, which has almost 2,400. The enlarged group would also become a bigger player in the increasingly important online market. If completed, the deal would be structured as a takeover of publicly traded Ladbrokes by Coral, which is owned by private equity firms. The combined company would then apply to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange. Shares in Ladbrokes jumped more than 20% to 147p upon news of the talks. Jim Mullen, was appointed three months ago as chief executive to shake up Ladbrokes, which has struggled to compete in a betting market transformed by online gambling. He was due to set out his plans to shareholders next week but the presentation may now be put on hold depending on talks with Coral. Mullen said: \u201cSince becoming CEO my focus has been on a more aggressive plan to build digital scale and grow our recreational customer base across all channels, which is key to creating a more sustainable and growing Ladbrokes. My plans are well advanced and I look forward to presenting them to shareholders. \u201cA merger with Gala Coral could create a combined business with significant scale and has the potential to generate substantial cost synergies, creating value for both companies\u2019 shareholders.\u201d The talks, which are at an early stage, raise the prospect of Andy Hornby once again working as a senior executive at a public company. Hornby, who is Gala Coral\u2019s chief operating officer, was the chief executive of HBOS when the bank almost imploded and was rescued by Lloyds in 2008. Hornby and other HBOS directors were condemned by the parliamentary commission on banking standards in 2013 for mistakes that led to the bank\u2019s \u201ccolossal failure\u201d. They are likely to suffer fresh criticism when a long-awaited regulatory inquiry into HBOS is finally published. No formal publication has been given. Hornby, who worked at Asda before HBOS, ran Alliance Boots for almost two years before leaving in March 2011 and joining Gala Coral three months later. Richard Buxton, head of equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, said Hornby deserved another chance if he was given the opportunity to work at another public company. \u201cEveryone agrees that he is a very good retailer. One can absolutely question the judgment of the board of HBOS in appointing him to a banking role. Should it be the case that he can never have a retailing role at a quoted company ever again? I think that would be quite a harsh judgment.\u201d Mullen, who would be the chief executive of any combined company, said the board had not yet decided whether a merger with Coral was the right strategic move at the right price. If the merger goes ahead, the combined company could sell new shares to investors to boost its balance sheet. Coral, whose 132 bingo halls would be excluded from a merger, has more than 1,800 betting shops in the UK while Ladbrokes has almost 2,300. Both companies are trying to expand online. Bookmakers\u2019 in-store activities have been hurt by a government clampdown on highly profitable fixed-odds betting machines while online bets have been subject to a 15% point of consumption tax since December. Ladbrokes tried to buy Coral in 1998 from its previous owner, the brewer Bass, but the deal was blocked by Peter Mandelson, who was the then-trade and industry secretary. Mandelson said the takeover would \u201cdamage competition and disadvantage punters\u201d by leaving Ladbrokes and William Hill as dominant players. But online gambling has since shaken up the betting market, with multiple operators competing for gamblers\u2019 money via mobile phones, tablets and computers. Buxton said the Competition &amp; Markets Authority would probably make the combined company sell or close many of its betting shops. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hinge on the CMA concluding that the world has changed. I think the industry has changed hugely since these companies originally tried to combine.\u201d Ladbrokes has been the subject of takeover talk for some time, having drifted compared with its rival William Hill and aggressive newer entrants to the market such as Ireland\u2019s Paddy Power \u2013 mentioned as a potential suitor \u2013 and the online gambling exchange Betfair.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Japanese shares rose to a 15-year high on Tuesday, and other Asia markets posted gains, amid renewed optimism that Greece will avoid defaulting on its debt after \u201cpositive\u201d crisis talks in Brussels on Monday. Investors in Japan and elsewhere in the region bought back shares after hopes rose that Greece would reach a debt deal with its international lenders later this week and avoid exiting the eurozone. Athens desperately needs fresh financing from international creditors to meet a 30 June deadline to repay a \u20ac1.6bn (US$1.8bn) IMF loan and avoid a possible default. Mirroring gains in European markets after Monday\u2019s talks, Japan\u2019s Nikkei share average jumped 1.2% on Tuesday morning to 20,739.90, its highest level since April 2000. The Nikkei could rise to its highest level since June 1997 if it trades above its 2000 peak of 20,833.21 later on Tuesday. Elsewhere, MSCI\u2019s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose by 0.3%. In Australia, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 was up 1.3%, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi index by 1.2%. The prospects for a breakthrough, after months of wrangling, rose after Donald Tusk, president of the European council, called Greece\u2019s proposals \u201ca positive step forward\u201d. Tusk added that Eurozone finance ministers could endorse cash in return for the proposed tax and pension reforms by Wednesday evening. The deal would then go before eurozone leaders for final approval the following morning. Progress in Brussels prompted investors to buy back Japanese shares after three weeks of losses for the Nikkei. \u201cThe majority of market participants are trading under the optimistic scenario that the Greek problems will be resolved,\u201d said Masashi Oda, senior investment officer at Sumitomo Mitsui trust bank. \u201cForeigners are buying again.\u201d The euro fell slightly to $1.1335 as some analysts warned that the deal on the table in Brussels would not necessarily solve Greece\u2019s debt woes. \u201cAlthough momentum appears to have turned positive, if there is no progress on negotiations for a program extension before the 30 June deadline, the ECB may have to increase haircuts on Greek assets, which could, in turn, precipitate the need for capital controls,\u201d strategists at Barclays said.",

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s date with destiny started with its upstart prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, being slapped on the face. It is the customary gesture of endearment from Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission. It means the two men are friends, despite Juncker saying at the weekend he no longer trusted Tsipras. And the day that was supposed to arrest Greece\u2019s collapse into bankruptcy, and prevent the euro\u2019s diminution, ended more than 12 hours later on Monday evening with the bizarre spectacle of a phantom summit. Monday\u2019s hotly awaited emergency gathering of eurozone leaders, called last Thursday evening to fix the Greek crisis or at least to attach sticking plasters to Greece\u2019s bleeding wounds, had nothing to decide and no real agenda to discuss. For that to happen, the finance ministers of the single currency bloc who gathered earlier in the afternoon had to assess the chances of a deal and make their recommendations to the leaders. They could not do that, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chaired the session, because they did not have enough time to study what Athens was proposing. Their minions would have to negotiate hard and come back later in the week. So why did the Eurogroup finance ministers come to Brussels? They had to, Dijsselbloem said, because they were obliged to prepare the emergency summit. They did not manage that. So what was the point of the summit? \u201cThe leaders are always free to have a different opinion,\u201d the Dutchman smiled. Despite all the hallmarks of a non-event or perhaps because of that, the summit went well. Over a supper of brill, roast beef, and lemon parfait, the leaders, not having to take a quick decision, seemed to chill a bit, taking the heat out of the increasingly intemperate exchanges that have marked the past few weeks. They might as well have booked in for the week. The finance ministers of the eurozone, plus the big shots from the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank will reassemble here on Wednesday evening to try to clinch the deal, 24 hours before the leaders return to Brussels to declare a victory snatched from the jaws of disaster. Tsipras caved and there may well be hell to pay back in Athens. But the Greeks were nonetheless said to be impersonating cats and too much cream. Tsipras wanted a favourable summit declaration to take home with him, but the meeting ended late on Monday night without granting him that. The aim was quite the contrary, said a senior EU official. The idea was \u201cto remove from Tsipras the illusion he can get a better deal at the summit, or that a decision can be taken at the summit level. The point is to have Tsipras learn the position of the other leaders. No negotiation\u201d. It was Tsipras who wanted a summit in the first place, insisting that Greece\u2019s pain and the eurozone\u2019s troubles could only be sorted out at the highest political level. The answer he heard from the chancellors, presidents and prime ministers was an ultimatum: \u201cYou can have your summit, but you\u2019re not getting a negotiation.\u201d Behind the confusion and the last-minute improvisation lay a weekend of frantic communication and crossed signals over a Greek proposal that was not really a proposal. Or was it? Negotiations collapsed in Luxembourg last Thursday with Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, memorably complaining there was no point in engaging in dialogue with the Greeks unless there were \u201cadults in the room\u201d. Tsipras, a neophyte prime minister, then spent much of Sunday on the phone to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, President Hollande of France, and Juncker, trying to prove he was an adult. Following a long list of rejected economic reform offers aimed at securing bailout cash, he promised new proposals. The number crunchers from the creditors \u2013 the commission, the IMF, and the European Central Bank \u2013 assembled in the Berlaymont building in Brussels at 5pm on Sunday to receive the Greek offer. They waited. And waited. At midnight the lights were still burning on the 13th floor of the Berlaymont. It was already Monday when the Greek paper arrived just after midnight. The technocrats got to work on the arithmetic that would determine whether a deal was doable: VAT rates, pension costs to GDP ratios, fiscal targets and primary budget surpluses. Martin Selmayr, the German christian democrat and Juncker\u2019s powerful chief of staff, tweeted that it might be tricky, but for the first time an agreement could be discerned. \u201cEine Zangengeburt,\u201d he predicted \u2013 a forceps birth. The commissioner for the euro, France\u2019s Pierre Moscovici, instantly took to the French airwaves to talk up the chances of a deal. But as he slapped Tsipras playfully on the cheek, Juncker started sounding worried. The weekend before last, the Greeks showed up in Brussels for negotiations without any proposals. They were asked to document their intentions and came back 24 hours later with nothing new. The \u201cwrong paper\u201d fiasco on Monday morning allowed eurozone finance ministers to dismiss the chances of any breakthrough on the grounds that Tsipras was stalling, seeking to avoid detailed negotiations. The German, Finnish, Irish and Austrian finance ministers voiced contempt. The Greeks maintained their habit of tardiness when Yanis Varoufakis, the outspoken finance minister, turned up 45 minutes late for the session. Dijsselbloem said the meeting could not decide anything because they did not have enough time for their aides to check whether the Greek sums added up. But commission sources, keen to strike a deal, believed the hawks on the creditor side were dissembling, trying to spoil a breakthrough. Juncker\u2019s spokesman said they had received the Greek proposals just after midnight, signed by Tsipras (a first), and that the Greek plan had been passed to the ECB and IMF. The \u201cnew\u201d version on Monday morning contained only cosmetic changes. Dijsselbloem admitted as much, while officials were impressed at the first \u201cdetailed and credible\u201d proposals they had seen from Tsipras in his five months in office. Merkel, as usual, hedged her bets and noted that there were several days in a week \u2013 a week being the time remaining until Greece\u2019s bailout lapses, the disaster deadline. The number-crunchers got to work. They have a hard 48 hours ahead of them. The ministers will be back in Brussels on Wednesday, the leaders on Thursday. And there will be no phantoms in the room this time.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hopes of a deal that would spare Greece from a looming debt default and possible exit from the single currency rose sharply on Monday after the country\u2019s European partners welcomed proposals from Athens to cut its pension bill and raise extra money from VAT. In what was seen in Brussels as the most positive development since negotiations began five months ago, the leftwing government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras showed a willingness to give ground on the two issues that have left it at odds with its creditors. An emergency summit of eurozone leaders ended on Monday night with high hopes of reaching a deal within 48 hours. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said eurozone finance ministers would meet on Wednesday evening, the third time in a week, to finalise a deal to be put to a summit in Brussels on Thursday. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, described the Greek offer of tax increases and spending cuts as \u201ca major step forward\u201d. He added: \u201cWe we will finalise the process this week.\u201d Share prices rose by 9% on the Athens stock market amid signs that the compromise put forward by Tsipras would form the basis of an agreement at the summit of European leaders, ahead of next Tuesday\u2019s deadline for a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) payment to the International Monetary Fund. The Greek government insisted that none of its red lines had been crossed, but finance ministers from eurozone countries believe Athens has made significant concessions by agreeing to raise an additional \u20ac2.7bn in revenues this year. Brussels called the plan \u201cdetailed, credible and impressive\u201d, and saw it as the basis for an agreement that would have further bailout funds released to Greece. \u201cIt\u2019s the first big positive sign from the Greeks,\u201d said one official. \u201cIt\u2019s the most comprehensive proposal they have made.\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who chairs the group of 19 eurozone countries, said the Greek plan was \u201ca basis to really restart the talks again and really get a result\u201d. In a letter accompanying the economic plan, Tsipras said that \u201cthe requirements of the [creditor] institutions for covering the fiscal gaps for 2015-16\u201d would be met absolutely and completely. Officials from the European commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF \u2013 the so-called troika \u2013 will spend the next 48 hours assessing whether Athens has now met demands from its creditors to make bigger reductions to its budget deficit this year. In the meantime, emergency funding from the ECB will allow Greek banks to stay open, amid reports that a further \u20ac1.6bn was pulled out of the banking system on Monday as the ECB threw a further lifeline to financial institutions. In its 11-page proposal, Greece accepted that its pension system needed to be reformed, and said it would save money by increasing pension contributions, health payments by retirees and a new tax on businesses. But pension rates would be left untouched, allowing Tsipras to say that he has not crossed his red lines. Greece said higher VAT would net an additional \u20ac1.3bn in 2016. Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble led demands by some Eurogroup finance ministers at Monday\u2019s meeting for capital controls in Greece \u2013 a curb on bank withdrawals \u2013 that would limit the exposure of European taxpayers to a possible default. Rearguard action from Berlin and the IMF \u2013 both of which are thought to have reservations about the Greek blueprint \u2013 could yet hold up or derail an agreement that would unlock the bailout funds that would let Athens to make a \u20ac1.6bn payment to the IMF at the end of the month. But if finance ministers give their approval, a final deal will be signed by European leaders when they meet for a two-day summit in Brussels on Thursday. Juncker said: \u201cMy aim is a deal by the end of the week. We are working day and night for this.\u201d Finance ministers from the euro group of countries will meet again tomorrow to assess whether their demands have been met and to check whether the Greek budget figures add up. Prospects of a breakthrough after months of argument prompted Greek bank shares to rise by 20%. The rally on the Athens market was mirrored at other European bourses, with shares in Germany, France and Spain all up by almost 4%. In Athens, government officials said Tsipras would continue to press for a solution that was both comprehensive and viable. Speculation that a six- to nine-month extension was now in the offing was dismissed as ultimately unworkable. \u201cFor it to be durable it has to be of long duration and it has to tackle the issue of our country\u2019s unsustainable debt,\u201d one official said. \u201cWe are hoping that all this talk of prolonging the current [bailout] accord is just part of the other side\u2019s negotiating tactics.\u201d The political opposition also warned against the perils of a short-term agreement on Monday \u2013 even if they also said an agreement was better than the alternative of no agreement and eurozone exit. Leading figures in the world of industry and commerce \u2013 which, like the rest of the economy, has been brought to a standstill by five months of fruitless talks said merely prolonging the current bailout programme might ultimately prove devastating. An estimated 8,500 small and medium-sized businesses have closed since the start of the year. For the second time in days, thousands of Greeks poured into Syntagma square in central Athens on Monday night to exhort the Tsipras government not to endanger Greece\u2019s place in the eurozone and by extension the EU. Unfurling a giant blue and white flag over the retaining wall of the Greek parliament, they chanted \u201cEurope, Europe, we are staying in Europe.\u201d \u201cTsipras has to know that he got into power with 36% of the vote, he is not there with the support of all Greeks and he has absolutely no right whatsoever to take us out of Europe,\u201d said Marietta Kontou, a shopowner, insisting it was outrageous that the leftist-led government had opened Greece\u2019s membership of the euro to question at all. \u201cEurope is where this country belongs. It is very important that we belong to the west.\u201d Greek plans Any deal between Greece and its creditors must start with a budget surplus target. That is the difference between tax income and government spending, expressed as a proportion of Greek GDP. The more surplus money that is generated every year by tax income, the more can be used to pay down the \u20ac240bn (\u00a3172bn) that Athens owes its troika of creditors. Alexis Tsipras is offering to achieve a 1% surplus this year, 2% next year, and 3% in 2017. It is a tall order for a country that has lost a quarter of its national income since the financial crash, has to cope with an unemployment rate of 26% and is owed \u20ac76bn in unpaid taxes. Those creditors \u2013 the ECB, IMF and European the commission \u2013 believed Tsipras was offering insufficient cuts to meet the 1% target. The difference between both sides was worth a modest-seeming \u20ac2bn in government expenditure. The proposals lodged on Monday by Tsipras and his team after a hectic weekend of negotiations were an attempt to bridge that gap and centre on two key areas: pensions and tax. Pensions The plan includes a restriction on early-retirement options from this year, saving \u20ac60m this year and \u20ac30m next year. The measure will accelerate a clampdown that was previously going to be phased in over several years. An increase in pension contributions will raise \u20ac350m this year and \u20ac800m next year, while a higher health contribution from retirees will raise \u20ac135m this year and \u20ac510m in 2016. Tax A rise in VAT will generate \u20ac300m this year and \u20ac1.6bn in 2016. Income tax rates remain intact, but a solidarity supplement on top of the main rate that was brought in after the crash is to rise, raising \u20ac220m this year. Corporations are to be clobbered with a surcharge of 12% on profits above \u20ac500,000. Corporation tax also rises to 29% next year from 26%, raising \u20ac410m.",

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said eurozone finance ministers would meet on Wednesday evening, the third time in a week, to finalise a deal to be put to a summit in Brussels on Thursday.<br></p> <p>Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, described the Greek offer of tax increases and spending cuts as \u201ca major step forward\u201d. He added: \u201cWe we will finalise the process this week.\u201d<br></p> <p>Share prices rose by 9% on the Athens stock market amid signs that the compromise put forward by Tsipras would form the basis of an agreement at the summit of European leaders, ahead of next Tuesday\u2019s deadline for a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) payment to the International Monetary Fund.<br></p> <p>The Greek government insisted that none of its red lines had been crossed, but finance ministers from eurozone countries believe Athens has made \u00adsignificant concessions by agreeing to raise an additional \u20ac2.7bn in revenues this year. Brussels called the plan \u201cdetailed, credible and impressive\u201d, and saw it as the basis for an agreement that would have further bailout funds released to Greece. \u201cIt\u2019s the first big positive sign from the Greeks,\u201d said one official. \u201cIt\u2019s the most comprehensive proposal they have made.\u201d</p> <p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who chairs the group of 19 eurozone countries, said the Greek plan was \u201ca basis to really restart the talks again and really get a result\u201d.</p> <p>In a letter accompanying the economic plan, Tsipras said that \u201cthe requirements of the [creditor] institutions for covering the fiscal gaps for 2015-16\u201d would be met absolutely and completely.</p> <p>Officials from the European commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF \u2013 the so-called troika \u2013 will spend the next 48 hours assessing whether Athens has now met demands from its creditors to make bigger reductions to its budget deficit this year. In the meantime, emergency funding from the ECB will allow Greek banks to stay open, amid reports that a further \u20ac1.6bn was pulled out of the banking system on Monday as the ECB threw a further lifeline to financial institutions.</p> <p>In its 11-page proposal, Greece accepted that its pension system needed to be reformed, and said it would save money by increasing pension contributions, health payments by retirees and a new tax on businesses. But pension rates would be left untouched, allowing Tsipras to say that he has not crossed his red lines. Greece said higher VAT would net an additional \u20ac1.3bn in 2016.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble led demands by some Eurogroup finance ministers at Monday\u2019s meeting for capital controls in Greece \u2013 a curb on bank withdrawals \u2013 that would limit the exposure of European taxpayers to a possible default.</p> <p>Rearguard action from Berlin and the IMF \u2013 both of which are thought to have reservations about the Greek blueprint \u2013 could yet hold up or derail an agreement that would unlock the bailout funds that would let Athens to make a \u20ac1.6bn payment to the IMF at the end of the month. </p> <p>But if finance ministers give their approval, a final deal will be signed by European leaders when they meet for a two-day summit in Brussels on Thursday. Juncker said: \u201cMy aim is a deal by the end of the week.

The rally on the Athens market was mirrored at other European bourses, with shares in Germany, France and Spain all up by almost 4%.</p> <p>In Athens, government officials said Tsipras would continue to press for a solution that was both comprehensive and viable. Speculation that a six- to nine-month extension was now in the offing was dismissed as ultimately unworkable. </p> <p>\u201cFor it to be durable it has to be of long duration and it has to tackle the issue of our country\u2019s unsustainable debt,\u201d one official said. </p> <p>\u201cWe are hoping that all this talk of prolonging the current [bailout] accord is just part of the other side\u2019s negotiating tactics.\u201d </p> <p>The political opposition also warned against the perils of a short-term agreement on Monday \u2013 even if they also said an agreement was better than the alternative of no agreement and eurozone exit.
