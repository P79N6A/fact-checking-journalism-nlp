      "bodyText": "Greece is braced for a second day of protests as representatives of international creditors arrive in Athens for crucial talks on plans to write off 50% of the country's debts. Negotiations over Greece's ballooning debts are expected to be accompanied by protesters accusing lenders of holding the country to ransom with demands for sky-high interest rates. As tens of thousands of striking workers took to the streets of the capital on Tuesday, in the first mass walk-out of 2012, many chanted \"down with the Papademos government here and now!\" EU officials, who had arrived in Athens with representatives from the International Monetary Fund, and European Central Bank (ECB), are known to want a quick deal to avoid a Greek default. A team led by Charles Dallara and Jean Lemierre, officials from the Institute of International Finance, will meet government negotiators to hammer out a deal that eluded them last week after several days of meetings. Dallara said this week that talks had yet to reach agreement on any aspect of a deal following demands from Greek negotiators for \"unrealistically\" low interest rates on its outstanding debts. The interim Greek government has hit back at accusations that Athens had neither the will nor ability to enforce economic reforms, with officials categorically rejecting the idea that the debt-hit country was heading for a messy default. Policymakers pointed to the headway Greece had made. George Pagoulatos, an adviser to the prime minister, Lucas Papademos, said: \"In the past two years the primary deficit has been reduced by nearly \u20ac20bn, a European record.\" Noting the net reduction of 132,000 civil servants since the start of 2010, he said: \"Overall costs in the public sector have also been cut dramatically.\" Officials from the EU and IMF have repeatedly accused Athens of failing to implement reforms.

Investors were cheered by a sharp rise in China's GDP, which showed the Chinese economy grew by 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The growth figure was the lowest for two and a half years, but beat economists' forecasts suggesting Chinese exports would be hit badly by the eurozone crisis. Oil prices rose on the prospect of resurgent growth in China coupled with a strong rise in analyst and investor sentiment in Germany after a January reading of -21.6 from the Mannheim-based ZEW economic think-tank improved on the -53.8 figure in December. The Spanish treasury, meanwhile, sold \u20ac3bn of 12-month bills at an average yield (interest rate) of just 2.049%, down from 4.05% the last time it sold this type of debt. This is another sign that S&amp;P's downgrades (it cut Spain by two notches from AA- to A) have not spooked investors. The US Dow Jones was up 105 points at 1800 GMT to reach 12527, while the FTSE closed at 5693, up 0.65%. Several analysts said the reaction to China's growth was wishful thinking and the world's second largest economy was still on a downward trajectory. Chang Jian, a Hong Kong-based economist at Barclays Capital, told Bloomberg a deeper recession in Europe, which might cause a sharper slump in demand for China's exports and a \"disorderly correction'' in the property market, were the biggest risks to the economy. The world's largest exporter might see shipment growth halve this year, while property investment, which accounts for about a fifth of the nation's fixed-asset spending, might expand at half last year's rate, Chang said. Capital Economics said China's overheating property market was ripe for a fall and could cause huge internal problems if developers went bust and banks were left nursing large debts. China has urged EU leaders to resolve the debt crisis, starting with a resolution to the Greek debt situation. But Brussels has struggled to bring countries with different outlooks on the crisis together. Finland is against a close fiscal union and informed Brussels that the need for a two-thirds majority in its parliament meant any vote on plans for a veto over member budgets was likely to be lost. Meanwhile, the ECB has made it known the plans for a fiscal pact are weak and need to be strengthened before it can agree to take further action to boost bank balance sheets. The negotiations in Athens will involve creditors exchanging their existing Greek bonds with new ones of a lower value, with the bigger aim of cutting Greece's debt by \u20ac100bn (\u00a383bn). The bond swap is crucial because it is a precondition for a second, \u20ac130bn bailout for Greece. The country's international rescuers, the troika of Brussels, the IMF and ECB, have warned that they will not extend any more support if a bond swap deal is not agreed. That means Greece could default on its debt in late March when the \u20ac14.5bn bond repayment is due, potentially threatening the entire eurozone's financial stability. Adding to the pressure on Greece, inspectors from the troika are expected to press the government for faster cost-cutting reforms. About 10,000 protesters have taken part in rallies in central Athens, demonstrating over potential pay cuts in the recession-battered private sector. Anti-austerity strikes in the capital disrupted public transport and other services, while journalism unions also launched a 48-hour strike. Police said that a plainclothes officer from the anti-terrorism division had been beaten and seriously injured by a group of about 30 protesters, who also took his handgun.

      "body": "<p>The electricals company Dixons has reported better than expected Christmas trading and said it was now confident it could repay a make-or-break \u00a3160m bond later this year.</p> <p>John Browett, chief executive of Dixons Retail, said the company's finances had been bolstered by bumper demand for tablet computers and ebook readers. \"This was an important trading period for us to get through, and we are satisfied by the results that we have got the cash and banking facilities to repay these bonds.\"</p> <p>Like-for-like sales at UK stores were still down 7% in the 12 weeks to 7 January, but the retailer said profit margins had improved as growing numbers of customers turned to its IT support service, Knowhow, for help.</p> <p>Group underlying sales finished down 5%, as a strong performance by its Nordic operation was cancelled out by problems in the eurozone, with sales down sharply at its UniEuro chain, in Italy, and in Kotsovolos, in Greece. The shares closed up more than 10% at 10.94p.</p> <p>Philip Dorgan, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the performance pointed to light at the end of the tunnel for Dixons. \"The most important trading period of the year is over and with other retailers dropping like flies, these numbers have to be mildly encouraging.

      "bodyText": "The electricals company Dixons has reported better than expected Christmas trading and said it was now confident it could repay a make-or-break \u00a3160m bond later this year. John Browett, chief executive of Dixons Retail, said the company's finances had been bolstered by bumper demand for tablet computers and ebook readers. \"This was an important trading period for us to get through, and we are satisfied by the results that we have got the cash and banking facilities to repay these bonds.\" Like-for-like sales at UK stores were still down 7% in the 12 weeks to 7 January, but the retailer said profit margins had improved as growing numbers of customers turned to its IT support service, Knowhow, for help. Group underlying sales finished down 5%, as a strong performance by its Nordic operation was cancelled out by problems in the eurozone, with sales down sharply at its UniEuro chain, in Italy, and in Kotsovolos, in Greece. The shares closed up more than 10% at 10.94p. Philip Dorgan, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the performance pointed to light at the end of the tunnel for Dixons. \"The most important trading period of the year is over and with other retailers dropping like flies, these numbers have to be mildly encouraging. We think that it can repay its bonds this year, helped by planned lower capital expenditure and cost savings.\" But internet retailers such as Amazon, and the supermarkets, remained a real threat to Dixons, Dorgan said. If trading deteriorated and the retailer was unable to generate sufficient cash to repay the bond, falling due in November, it could be forced to sell the company's crown jewels, the successful Scandinavian chain Elkj\u00f8p. The electronics market has been one of the hardest hit by the downturn in consumer spending, with demand for TVs and games consoles falling by as much as 20%. That, coupled with cut-throat competition from the internet and supermarkets, is why the US group Best Buy recently shut its fledgling UK chain, while the French group Kesa in effect paid a bidder to take loss-making British chain Comet off its hands. Browett has spent the last four years refurbishing Dixons' stores and improving customer service, and says shoppers are increasingly looking for advice before they make big purchases like music systems. Consumer confidence remained fragile in many of its markets, he said, but shoppers were willing to spend on exciting gadgets; Dixons' UK stores were selling a Kindle every three seconds in the fortnight before Christmas, while sales of tablet computers were up nearly 200%. Browett also reported strength at the top end of the market as shoppers went for high-end 3D and internet-connected TVs as well as Sonos wireless HiFi systems. Dixons said that despite continued turbulence in the eurozone it was committed to keeping operations in Italy and Greece, where its Kotsovolos chain was the leader with a 30% market share. \"Greece is a good market for us,\" said Browett, who said laptop sales had strengthened during the period. \"Computing has grown all the way through because people use computing to live their lives.\" Since the financial crisis began in 2007, and despite Monday's bounce, Dixons's shares have lost 90% of their value. \"It is said that 90% of companies that lose 90% of their value don't survive. We believe the improvement to Dixons' product, stores and operations over the last three years gives it a fighting chance,\" Dorgan said.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Essar Energy </strong>lost more than a quarter of its value after India's supreme court ruled against the company over a billion dollar tax bill.</p> <p>The court overturned an earlier decision in Essar's favour, which relates to a scheme whereby the company has been able to defer the repayment of sales tax. So far it has benefited to the tune of $1.24bn, but this looks like it will now come to an end. The company - 77% owned by Indian conglomerate Essar - was originally due to repay the tax from 2021 onwards, but the ruling means it is unclear when the payments will now start.</p> <p>Essar - which floated at 420p a share in 2010 - plunged 45.4p to 127p, making it the biggest faller in the leading index.</p> <p>Overall, stronger than expected Chinese growth figures and a number of successful European bond auctions helped overcome the continuing nervousness over the eurozone crisis. By the close the FTSE 100 had climbed 36.51 points to 5693.95. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> Today's market movements in London have been dominated by GDP figures from China which showed that growth in the world's second biggest economy is slowing less than expected. One of the major issues going into this year has been whether China's economy will land soft or hard and today's figures are evidence that a softer landing is more likely. This means that the power house behind global growth is set to continue growing strongly, which will benefit London stocks in the FTSE 100 because of their global reach. </blockquote> <p>Mining shares were among the risers following the figures from China, a key consumer of commodities. <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 105p to \u00a336.94 while <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 21p to \u00a310.88.</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> ended 0.43p higher at 24.85p after it sold its aircraft leasing business to Japan's Sumitomo for $7.3bn. Shore Capital moved from sell to hold, with analyst Gary Greenwood saying:</p> <blockquote> Although the deal won't have a material impact on the overall financial position of the group, we view this as another important milestone in the run-down of the non-core portfolio. <br> </blockquote> <p>But catering group <strong>Compass</strong> dipped 2.5p to 607.5p after RBC reduced its rating from sector perform to underperform. RBC said:</p> <blockquote> Compass has maintained an impressive track record over the last four years. The focus on margins, improving returns, and strengthening the balance sheet has driven the valuation up to a PE of over 14 times for fiscal 2012 on our numbers, and we believe the stock needs upgrades to maintain that valuation here. While we have been a big supporter of the story, we have become increasingly more cautious on the stock as its valuation rose, and with the recent run, we now move to underperform. </blockquote> <p><strong>SABMiller</strong> slipped 23p to \u00a323.04 ahead of a third quarter trading update on Thursday. Pablo Zuanic at Liberum Capital said he expected sales volumes to be below the company's guidance, with only the Latin American and African businesses doing better. Nor did he believe recent speculation about possible bid interest from Anheuser-Busch InBev. He said:</p> <blockquote> We are sceptical of market talk of a take over. ABI would be interested only in the Andean part [in South America], so this would require Heineken and Diageo to also get involved. Heineken is digesting Femsa, and Diageo may be going through a transition. </blockquote> <p>Phil Carroll at Shore Capital was generally positive on the company but said he would not discourage profit taking ahead of the update:</p> <blockquote> SAB does face some headwinds short term, including the adverse impact on results from foreign exchange translation on the back of the dollar strengthening against a number of its emerging market exposures. Raw material cost inflation is also putting some pressure on margins, along with ongoing business investment. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere packaging group <strong>DS Smith</strong> added 6.6p to 210.2p after it splashed out \u00a31.3bn to boost its business in Europe.</p> <p>Just weeks after completing the sale of its office products business Spicer for \u00a3160m, Smith is buying the packaging business of Sweden's Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget. The move takes it into new markets across Europe, and pushes Smith closer to its target of being \"the leading supplier of recycled packaging for consumer goods in Europe.\" The SCA business employs 12,000 people and the size of the deal means it is classified as a reverse takeover.</p> <p>It is being funded by a combination of debt and a nine-for-eight rights issue at a deeply discounted 95p a share to raise \u00a3466m.</p> <p>Analyst Hector Forsythe at Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> Our initial reaction is that this is a big step and that comes with risk, but it's a leap in the strategy to become the leading European supplier of recycled packaging. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Afren</strong> added 15.5p to 130.5p after the exploration company said it had made a significant oil discovery at one of its wells off south east Nigeria. It will begin production tests over the next few weeks and also plans to start drilling off Ghana later this month. Credit Suisse repeated its outperform rating and raised its target price from 130p to 148p. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> We look forward to Afren's update on the exploration programme on January 23. Up to 14 wells in 2012, worth 32p a share on our risked net asset value with a blue sky upside of 173p a share, offer a balance of high-risk, high-impact exploration (Keta in Ghana, OPL30 in Nigeria) and lower risk exploration/appraisal (Jebel Simrit wells in the Kurdish region of Iraq, Ebok/Okwok/OML115 wells in Nigeria). <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>CSR</strong>, the microchip specialist, climbed 8.9p to 215.9p after JP Morgan Cazenove moved from neutral to overweight.</p> <p>Finally Aim-listed <strong>Transense Technologies</strong> jumped nearly 10% to 4.25p after saying it was now shipping volume quantities of its latest sensor for the power industry and has secured distribution partners in Brazil, China and Taiwan.</p>",

The company - 77% owned by Indian conglomerate Essar - was originally due to repay the tax from 2021 onwards, but the ruling means it is unclear when the payments will now start. Essar - which floated at 420p a share in 2010 - plunged 45.4p to 127p, making it the biggest faller in the leading index. Overall, stronger than expected Chinese growth figures and a number of successful European bond auctions helped overcome the continuing nervousness over the eurozone crisis. By the close the FTSE 100 had climbed 36.51 points to 5693.95. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said: Today's market movements in London have been dominated by GDP figures from China which showed that growth in the world's second biggest economy is slowing less than expected. One of the major issues going into this year has been whether China's economy will land soft or hard and today's figures are evidence that a softer landing is more likely. This means that the power house behind global growth is set to continue growing strongly, which will benefit London stocks in the FTSE 100 because of their global reach. Mining shares were among the risers following the figures from China, a key consumer of commodities. Rio Tinto rose 105p to \u00a336.94 while Kazakhmys climbed 21p to \u00a310.88. Royal Bank of Scotland ended 0.43p higher at 24.85p after it sold its aircraft leasing business to Japan's Sumitomo for $7.3bn. Shore Capital moved from sell to hold, with analyst Gary Greenwood saying: Although the deal won't have a material impact on the overall financial position of the group, we view this as another important milestone in the run-down of the non-core portfolio. But catering group Compass dipped 2.5p to 607.5p after RBC reduced its rating from sector perform to underperform. RBC said: Compass has maintained an impressive track record over the last four years. The focus on margins, improving returns, and strengthening the balance sheet has driven the valuation up to a PE of over 14 times for fiscal 2012 on our numbers, and we believe the stock needs upgrades to maintain that valuation here. While we have been a big supporter of the story, we have become increasingly more cautious on the stock as its valuation rose, and with the recent run, we now move to underperform. SABMiller slipped 23p to \u00a323.04 ahead of a third quarter trading update on Thursday. Pablo Zuanic at Liberum Capital said he expected sales volumes to be below the company's guidance, with only the Latin American and African businesses doing better. Nor did he believe recent speculation about possible bid interest from Anheuser-Busch InBev. He said: We are sceptical of market talk of a take over. ABI would be interested only in the Andean part [in South America], so this would require Heineken and Diageo to also get involved. Heineken is digesting Femsa, and Diageo may be going through a transition. Phil Carroll at Shore Capital was generally positive on the company but said he would not discourage profit taking ahead of the update: SAB does face some headwinds short term, including the adverse impact on results from foreign exchange translation on the back of the dollar strengthening against a number of its emerging market exposures. Raw material cost inflation is also putting some pressure on margins, along with ongoing business investment. Elsewhere packaging group DS Smith added 6.6p to 210.2p after it splashed out \u00a31.3bn to boost its business in Europe. Just weeks after completing the sale of its office products business Spicer for \u00a3160m, Smith is buying the packaging business of Sweden's Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget. The move takes it into new markets across Europe, and pushes Smith closer to its target of being \"the leading supplier of recycled packaging for consumer goods in Europe.\" The SCA business employs 12,000 people and the size of the deal means it is classified as a reverse takeover. It is being funded by a combination of debt and a nine-for-eight rights issue at a deeply discounted 95p a share to raise \u00a3466m. Analyst Hector Forsythe at Oriel Securities said: Our initial reaction is that this is a big step and that comes with risk, but it's a leap in the strategy to become the leading European supplier of recycled packaging. Afren added 15.5p to 130.5p after the exploration company said it had made a significant oil discovery at one of its wells off south east Nigeria. It will begin production tests over the next few weeks and also plans to start drilling off Ghana later this month. Credit Suisse repeated its outperform rating and raised its target price from 130p to 148p. The bank said: We look forward to Afren's update on the exploration programme on January 23. Up to 14 wells in 2012, worth 32p a share on our risked net asset value with a blue sky upside of 173p a share, offer a balance of high-risk, high-impact exploration (Keta in Ghana, OPL30 in Nigeria) and lower risk exploration/appraisal (Jebel Simrit wells in the Kurdish region of Iraq, Ebok/Okwok/OML115 wells in Nigeria). CSR, the microchip specialist, climbed 8.9p to 215.9p after JP Morgan Cazenove moved from neutral to overweight. Finally Aim-listed Transense Technologies jumped nearly 10% to 4.25p after saying it was now shipping volume quantities of its latest sensor for the power industry and has secured distribution partners in Brazil, China and Taiwan.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, has warned the UK's leading banks to rein back on bonus payments or risk a backlash from the public. King said market capitalism should not only work efficiently but should be seen to be fair; huge bonus payments in a time of austerity and declining average incomes would be viewed as unfair by most people. His comments to the Treasury select committee will add pressure on leading banks to restrict bonus payments to senior staff due in the next few weeks. EU rules have revealed that Goldman Sachs paid \u00a34m on average to its top-flight staff in London in 2010. Goldman Sachs' profits are expected to fall when the bank reveals its 2011 results. Like most Wall Street operations, Goldmans suffered a drop in business during 2011. Morgan Stanley, another hard-hit Wall Street investment bank, is understood to have told staff that cash bonuses will be capped at $125,000 (\u00a382,000), although they could still be handed stock. The governor's call for restraint came just days after Lloyds Banking Group boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio announced he would not take a payout that could have been worth \u00a32.4m, citing the \"tough financial circumstances of people'' as well as the bank's poor performance and his two-month long sick leave. However, state-owned Lloyds and RBS are still believed to be preparing multimillion-pound payouts to some staff . King said: \"If we could reduce the situation where banks are too big to fail then we would reduce the revenues made on financial instruments and the excessive profits banks make. That is what will end the excessive payments in our banks.\" He was giving evidence to MPs on proposals for greater oversight of the banking system to prevent another financial crisis. The government has put forward plans for a financial policy committee (FPC) inside the Bank of England to monitor the finances and activities of systemically important banks. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's director of financial stability, said banks had increased their capital buffers but another credit crunch would make them vulnerable to collapse. \"We have gone 30 years without properly emphasising that these rainy day resources are there to be used in a rainy day, and at the moment it's pouring. \"I would be perfectly happy to see banks' capital ratios falling\u2026 in the current weather.\" FPC member Michael Cohrs said many foreign banks were in a worse situation than UK banks and more vulnerable to collapse. Cohrs, a former investment banker at Deutsche Bank, warned that UK banks would be harmed by a deterioration in the eurozone's economy, but were not the first in line. King rejected plans to use the Bank of England's 12-strong court to oversee the handling of the next financial crisis in favour of a committee of non-executive directors with powers only to review decisions in retrospect. King said plans by MPs to use the court amounted to allowing the Bank to oversee itself. He said a separate independent committee could look back at the processes used by the FPC in its handling of a bank collapse to learn lessons and verify that best practice was followed. Labour MP George Mudie accused the governor of recommending a scheme that allowed him and other bank officials to conduct bank rescues in secret and without proper oversight. During a heated session of questioning about the proposals that will govern the bank's activities in a crisis, Mudie said King was pushing back on proposals for closer scrutiny. \"This is an example of your need to throw your toys out of the pram every time someone questions your empire,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Inflation fell at the fastest rate in three years in December, to a six-month low of 4.2%, raising hopes that the squeeze on hard-pressed households' living standards will start to abate in 2012. The Bank of England has long predicted that inflation would fall rapidly as weak demand from shoppers forces retailers to cut prices. Official figures show that annual inflation was 4.2% in December, down from 4.8% in November, and a full percentage point lower than its peak in September. The last time there was such a large fall in the inflation rate from one month to another was in December 2008, when Alistair Darling's emergency VAT cut was introduced at the height of the world financial crisis. Chris Williamson, chief economist at information provider Markit, said: \"Further falls are likely in coming months, reducing the squeeze on incomes seen last year and therefore providing a much needed boost to economic growth in 2012.\" The fierce downward pressure on workers' buying power over the past twelve months, from weak wage growth and rocketing prices, was one of the key reasons the economy was far weaker than many forecasters predicted in 2011. A clear sign that inflation has started declining could open the way for the Bank of England to signal a renewed expansion of its \u00a3275bn quantitative easing programme next month, as it publishes its quarterly forecasts. The Office for National Statistics, which published the inflation figures on Tuesday, said that retail price inflation, which also includes mortgage costs, also fell sharply, from 5.2% in November, to 4.8% last month. Falling petrol and gas prices, and price cuts in clothing stores were the main factors bearing down on inflation, according to the ONS, while the only upward pressure came from higher charges for phone calls, both on mobiles and landlines.",

    "webTitle": "Gold price 'to hit $2,000 an ounce'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gold prices are on the march again. Forecast to power past $2,000 (\u00a31,300) an ounce later this year or in early 2013, the prices will be underpinned by fearful small investors in Germany and Switzerland buying ever more bars and coins, as well as rising demand for gold jewellery from India's and China's burgeoning middle classes. The Thomson Reuters GFMS annual gold survey, published on Tuesday, reveals that global investment in gold jumped more than 20% last year to a record $80bn, pushing the price to its peak of $1,920 an ounce in September. Much of this was due to physical buying of bullion: purchases of gold bars rose by more than a third to almost 1,200 metric tonnes, particularly in China, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. East Asia accounted for 456 tonnes of the total (up 53%), western markets bought 335 tonnes (up 41%) and India 297 tonnes (up 9%). Philip Newman, research director in precious metals at Thomson Reuters GFMS, said that with the spectre of 1920s hyperinflation haunting Germans, the last two years have seen strong growth in the number of smaller investors buying gold bars and coins. \"For many years now, these German-speaking markets have had a well-developed infrastructure for consumers to buy product.\" Demand for gold jewellery dipped by 2% but remained resilient last year, thanks to strong demand from India and China. Demand is predicted to hold up this year, even though the rupee has weakened and there will be fewer auspicious days in India than in 2011 \u2013 days marked out in the Hindu calendar as lucky for events such as marriage, buying and selling. The Thomson Reuters report also predicts the gold market is nearing the closing stages of a decade-long bull run \u2013 assuming economies start to recover next year and interest rates begin to rise. The price of spot gold has leapt from $272 an ounce at the end of 2000 to around $1,644 today, a six-fold increase. In the months since September gold has lost its shine as investors piled into dollars instead, seen as the last remaining investment haven. The report suggests that having climbed by 28% in 2011, prices may struggle in the short term and only achieve an average of $1,640 in the first half of 2012, before rising towards $2,000 later in the year. Even then, allowing for inflation the gold price would still be some way off their $2,500 inflation-adjusted peak in 1980 that followed the oil price shock in the wake of the Iranian revolution. Philip Klapwijk, global head of metals analytics at Thomson Reuters GFMS, said: \"We've seen a great deal of attention on the eurozone debt crisis, which has led some to seek out the dollar and US Treasuries as a least bad option. However, the re-emergence of US concerns, in particular any apparent need to adopt [a third round of quantitative easing], could really fire up the gold market. After all, don't forget that gold's price spike last August/September followed on from the US debt ceiling impasse and downgrade.\" The report predicts that the second half of the year will see the return of concerns about the health of the US economy, prompting a fresh round of quantitative easing. Newman said despite some encouraging recent economic indicators in the US, the country's huge debt problems remain unresolved and are unlikely to be tackled during an election year, which will make investing in the dollar less attractive. Coupled with exceptionally low interest rates across Europe and the US, and rising inflation, this should benefit bullion. A survey of mining executives by PricewaterhouseCoopers last week found that 80% of mining companies expected the price of gold to continue to increase this year, with the majority expecting it to peak at $2,000 an ounce. Tim Goldsmith, global mining leader at PwC, believes that amid the current market volatility, companies that are flush with cash will swoop on smaller players, which are more vulnerable to market fluctuations and have difficulty raising capital. Volatile financial markets have prompted countries around the world to step up their gold purchases. Central bank purchases are estimated to have jumped to 430 tonnes last year, which also encouraged private sector investment. The Bank of Korea made two major gold purchases - 25 metric tonnes in June and a further 15 metric tonnes in November \u2013 the first time it had bought gold since the 1997-1998 Asian financial crises. Goldsmith said: \"This is a trend we are seeing not only in developed economies, but emerging markets have also shown interest in boosting their gold holdings. We believe countries are now entering into a long-term period of gold accumulation. Given the relatively low amounts of gold available for purchase, countries with substantial foreign currency reserves that wish to diversify away from US dollars must do this over a long period.\"",

The price of spot gold has leapt from $272 an ounce at the end of 2000 to around $1,644 today, a six-fold increase.</p> <p>In the months since September <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/dec/29/gold-miners-lose-ground-ftse-up?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">gold has lost its shine as investors piled into dollars</a> instead, seen as the last remaining investment haven.</p> <p>The report suggests that having climbed by 28% in 2011, prices may struggle in the short term and only achieve an average of $1,640 in the first half of 2012, before rising towards $2,000 later in the year. Even then, allowing for inflation the gold price would still be some way off their $2,500 inflation-adjusted peak in 1980 that followed the oil price shock in the wake of the Iranian revolution.</p> <p>Philip Klapwijk, global head of metals analytics at Thomson Reuters GFMS, said: \"We've seen a great deal of attention on the eurozone debt crisis, which has led some to seek out the dollar and US Treasuries as a least bad option. However, the re-emergence of US concerns, in particular any apparent need to adopt [a third round of quantitative easing], could really fire up the gold market. After all, don't forget that gold's price spike last August/September followed on from the US debt ceiling impasse and downgrade.\"</p> <p>The report predicts that the second half of the year will see the return of concerns about the health of the US economy, prompting a fresh round of quantitative easing. Newman said despite some encouraging recent economic indicators in the US, the country's huge debt problems remain unresolved and are unlikely to be tackled during an election year, which will make investing in the dollar less attractive. Coupled with exceptionally low interest rates across Europe and the US, and rising inflation, this should benefit bullion.</p> <p>A survey of mining executives by PricewaterhouseCoopers last week found that 80% of mining companies expected the price of gold to continue to increase this year, with the majority expecting it to peak at $2,000 an ounce. Tim Goldsmith, global mining leader at PwC, believes that amid the current market volatility, companies that are flush with cash will swoop on smaller players, which are more vulnerable to market fluctuations and have difficulty raising capital.</p> <p>Volatile financial markets have prompted countries around the world to step up their gold purchases. Central bank purchases are estimated to have jumped to 430 tonnes last year, which also encouraged private sector investment. The Bank of Korea made two major gold purchases - 25 metric tonnes in June and a further 15 metric tonnes in November \u2013 the first time it had bought gold since the 1997-1998 Asian financial crises.</p> <p>Goldsmith said: \"This is a trend we are seeing not only in developed economies, but emerging markets have also shown interest in boosting their gold holdings. We believe countries are now entering into a long-term period of gold accumulation. Given the relatively low amounts of gold available for purchase, countries with substantial foreign currency reserves that wish to diversify away from US dollars must do this over a long period.\"</p>",
