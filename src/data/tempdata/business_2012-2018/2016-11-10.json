      "bodyText": "It\u2019s official! The Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new alltime high, as Wall Street continues to assess the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. After another day of volatile trading in world markets, starting with big gains in Asia, the Dow ended the day up nearly 1.2% at 18,807 points. It was a rally driven by companies who, investors think, will do well under a Trump presidency. That means banks (assuming the new administration repeals the Dodd-Frank regulations), and industrial firms (who would profit from infrastructure sending). But tech firms kept falling, hit by fears that immigration curbs or protectionist trade police would hurt them. Bloomberg has a neat summary: Amazon.com Inc. fell 3.8 percent to lead the rout in technology. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. jumped 4.6 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed 4.3 percent. Drugmakers advanced, led by Pfizer Inc.\u2019s 4.3 percent rally. Caterpillar Inc. added 2.5 percent. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. plunged 3.5 percent. Government bond yields ended the day higher too, pushed up by expectations of higher inflation and extra US government borrowing. The Dow is pushing higher, after Donald Trump and Barack Obama have their first meeting since the election. It\u2019s their first face-to-face meeting ever, in fact, Trump told reporters as the two men sat side by side, looking perfectly polite and rather serious. Our US politics liveblog has full details. Here\u2019s a flavour: Obama said the number one priority was to ensure a smooth transition, so Trump could be a successful president. \u201cIf he succeeds, the country succeeds,\u201d Obama said. Trump said he had \u201crespect for the president\u201d and said they talked about some wonderful things and some difficult things. Asked if he would seek the advice of the president, Trump said Obama was a \u201cvery fine man.\u201d And this latest sign of grown-up behaviour in Washington DC has pushed the Dow up by 1.05%, or 195 points, to 18,785, on track for a record close. I\u2019m taking a break now, but we\u2019ll be back with the Wall Street close... Capital Economics says investors are still in the dark about Donald Trump\u2019s plans: There is clearly still a large degree of uncertainty regarding the economic policies of the incoming Republican administration. However, investors appear to be concerned about the inflationary consequences if Mr Trump were to pursue protectionist policies alongside a sizeable fiscal expansion at a time when there is a limited degree of spare capacity in the economy. After three hours of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is still on track to hit a record close. Pharmaceutical firms, banks and manufacturing companies are all leading the rally, on predictions that they\u2019ll benefit from Trumponomics. But technology firms are dragging the index back, due to fears that they\u2019ll suffer under the next presidency. Here\u2019s the story of how the Dow defied forecasts and spiked after Trump\u2019s victory: A new burst of volatility has driven the pound up against the US dollar, triggering a late selloff in London. Sterling is now up 1% at $1.251, as the markets continue to be buffeted as investors come to terms with Trump\u2019s success. A stronger pound will be welcomed by importers, but it makes a dent in the value of international companies who earn money abroad. So the FTSE 100 has just closed in the red, down 83 points at 6827. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, finished 0.4% higher though. It\u2019s been a funny day in the London stock market, even by recent standards. Bank shares have jumped, mirroring the rise in government bond yields (banks would welcome an end to ultra-low interest rates) Mining stocks are also up, following the surge in commodity prices -- America will need a lot more metal to implement Trump\u2019s new infrastructure plan. But utility stocks, tobacco firms and other defensive stocks have slid today, some by over 5%. The International Monetary Fund says it is looking forward to working with Donald Trump, and isn\u2019t prejudging him. Spokesman Gerry Rice told a press briefing in Washington that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to speculate\u201d about whether Trump would hurt the global economy. Rice added: \u201cWe need to wait and see what the policies will actually be and we\u2019ll be making an assessment at that time.\u201d European stock markets are heading lower in late trading, as Trump-inspired volatility grips the City again. The S&amp;P tech stock index has shed 3%, and is on track for its worst day since the Brexit vote (via Reuters). Technology shares are suffering a Trump slump today, as investors calculate that Silicon Valley could suffer under the next president. Shares in Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook have all fallen by at least 4%, and Apple and Microsoft are in the red too. Trump\u2019s criticism of companies who sent manufacturing overseas and hire large numbers of skilled workers from abroad, using the H1-B visa, could be bad news for the tech sector. He\u2019s also no fan of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was pretty scathing of Trump during the election campaign. Investors large and small will be relieved that Wall Street hasn\u2019t crashed since Donald Trump pulled off one of the most surprising election results of the age. But obviously the market reaction plays second fiddle to the wider consequences of America\u2019s choice -- as the protests in New York, Chicago, Boston etc overnight show. Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan says Trump needs to pass three tests, as the world watches him closely. The first will be for him to build a strong cabinet, with respected figures in key posts of Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State. Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u2013 notably, the US Federal Reserve. Flanders points out that Trump\u2019s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy: The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates. And remember, Trump\u2019s success or failure won\u2019t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says: This is about the kind of country that America wants to be. At the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be judged. Whether Mr Trump will actually deliver with on that promise is another matter.\u201d Let\u2019s be honest, most analysts had predicted heavy losses if Trump won the presidential election. And most analysts were wrong. There are four pragmatic reasons to explain why stock markets have rallied since Trump won the presidential race, says Jim Cielinski of Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Trump \u201cthe President\u201d will not be the same thing as Trump \u201cthe candidate\u201d. Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his ability to define himself as a \u201cwinner\u201d will require a different approach, and most of his pre-election proposals will be modified. The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the hours following the victory. There was much dissent even within the party, but a \u201cclean-sweep\u201d soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll. Adversaries within the party, such as Paul Ryan, recognise that their own careers will be cut short if they fail to mend the wounds and push the agenda forward. Expectations that the cabinet in a Trump presidency may hold unusual power, and that the markets must wait to assess who is appointed before jumping to conclusions. For the markets, the recognition that stimulative policy still carries with it expansionary benefits, irrespective of the presidential qualifications or likeability of the man putting the ideas forward. Banks stocks are rallying this morning, with JP Morgan up 4% and Goldman Sachs gaining 2%. They\u2019re benefitting from speculation that the Republicans could ditch Dodd-Frank, the legislation brought in to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. Pharmaceutical stocks are up too, with Pfizer gaining 3.6%. Drug companies are boosted by Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, as she\u2019d promised to end price-gouging. And construction and infrastructure companies are benefitting from Trump\u2019s promise to rebuild American infrastructure. Caterpillar is up 2%. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new intraday record high, as the Trump bump reached New York. Shares have risen at the start of trading in Wall Street, adding to yesterday\u2019s rally, and defying predictions that markets would slump if Republicans won the race for the White House. The Dow is up 115 points, or +0.6%, at 18709. And the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq has gained at least 0.5% too: Investors are still optimistic that Trump will deliver a growth-friendly fiscal stimulus scheme, despite the concerns flagged up earlier in this blog. Indeed, there\u2019s a remarkable u-turn underway, as Wall Street hopes that the billionaire businessman can metamorphose into a responsible president. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says it shows how fickle investors can be: Before yesterday morning Trump was toxic yet now, following a vulgarity-free victory speech and back-peddling comments about Janet Yellen\u2019s position at the Fed, he is the biggest turn-on the market has seen in months. Never mind mere stagflation, the markets are being spooked by a new and scary-sounding beast. Trumpflation! The Financial Times has coined this term, to explain the big selloff in bond prices today. The fear is that bond investors might stampede for the exits if the new president drives up economic growth, inflation, and inflation expectations, with a debt-financed stimulus programme. Andrew Wilson, global co-head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says: \u201cUnder a Trump presidency we are more likely to see fiscal expansion that drives growth and markets are reflecting that. \u201cThere was already latent inflationary pressures from the jobs market - Mr Trump\u2019s election has added fuel to that. Long term inflation expectations are rising and that explains why bond yields are rising and the yield curve is steepening.\u201d And if everyone tries to sell at once, yields could spike alarmingly and cause a bond crash. Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, fears America is entering an era of stagflation -- rising prices, but little real growth. He\u2019s been speaking on CNBC: Greenspan also backed Donald Trump over one issue - the regulation of America\u2019s banking sector - saying: \u201cI\u2019d love to see Dodd-Frank disappear. Ouch! A nasty selloff is underway in the government bond market right now. The price of debt issued by countries such as the US, the UK and Germany is falling sharply, driving up the interest rates (or yield) on the debt. Investors appear to be betting that Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies will drive up inflation, should he succeed in slashing tax rates and embark on that debt-fuelled programme of rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure. As FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga puts it: Pledges of massive U.S fiscal spending have heightened expectations of Trump implementing fiscal stimulus measures, including tax cuts which may bolster profit growth consequently boosting inflation. So, bond prices are a sea of electronic red ink, as investors are less keen to hold low-yielding government bonds in a world of higher inflation. Lower bond prices shows that governments must pay more to service their national debts. The UK 10-year gilt yield has jumped to 1.335%, from 1.25% last night. The US 10-year Treasury yield is up at 2.09%, from 2.06% The German 10-year bund yield has spiked to 0.29%, from 0.17% Longer-dated debt is also weakening: We should remember that bond yields have been driven down to record low levels in recent years, as central banks have hoovered them up through their quantitative easing schemes. So a return to normal levels wouldn\u2019t be a disaster. Except....a hefty bond selloff would suggest alarm in the markets, and inflict losses on those who have bought at the elevated levels recently. And that may explain why the FTSE 100 is now negative, and other European markets are lower as this morning\u2019s Trump Bump threatens to fizzle out. Investors may be taking a big risk by deciding that Donald Trump will become a new man once he crosses the seal in the Oval Office carpet. The \u2018Trump bump\u2019 has been based on a somewhat breezy assumption that the new president will successfully implement the debt-fuelled infrastructure programme that many experts support, while ignoring the chance that we actually enter an era of painful protectionism and trade wars. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group in London, has just published a \u2018must-read\u2019 blog piece, analysing the impact of Trump. Here\u2019s a flavour: The markets seem to have decided that [aggressive deficit-financed state spending] will indeed now happen \u2014 stocks up, commodities up, bonds down. Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate. I\u2019m not so sure. To adapt a a phrase: \u201cdemagogues can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u201d. Still, as a base case a meaningful fiscal easing seems likely. Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u2014 they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks useback of the napkin logic to tell themselves \u201cthese tax cuts will pay for themselves\u201d. (Actually they won\u2019t). But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says: Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u2019s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u2019s Presidency could bring about \u2014 a rejection of \u201cglobalisation\u201d/economic openness. And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 to achieve. There\u2019s lots more here: Hello.... the rally in European stocks is petering out. The FTSE 100 has now shed its early gains and is now down 6 points, having been up 50 points at the start. Not clear what\u2019s prompted this... Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, is cautiously hopeful that the infrastructure plan proposed by Donald Trump could help the US economy. He just told Bloomberg TV that he \u201cwelcomes and applauds\u201d Trump\u2019s pledge to renew America\u2019s highways, bridges, airports schools and hospitals. It could boost job creation in the short tun, and expand the US economy\u2019s capacity for growth in the medium term, believes Summers - who has often called for more fiscal spending to fight \u2018secular stagnation\u2019. But Summers also sounds deeply concerned, saying Trump needs to propose \u201cserious and concrete plans\u201d to address America\u2019s economic concerns, and surround himself with responsible people with \u201cconsiderable experience\u201d. He says calling China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d is unwise, while repealing the NAFTA trade deal would do enormous economic damage. And Summers, who served under Bill Clinton, suggets Trump cannot be as divisive in government as he was in the campaign. Unless there is a clear sense that all Americans are welcomed and part of his vision of a prosperous America, and all nations are part of his vision o f a prosperous world, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be successful in creating the world we all want to see, Summers concludes. Demand for gold hit a record high yesterday, which tells you a couple of things. 1) There was a massive flight to safe-haven assets as the shock election result rocked Asian and European markets. 2) People are buying gold as a hedge against inflation (the price has risen by 0.3% today). Over in America, Donald Trump is preparing to visit the White House to meet president Obama, following a night of protests against his election victory. Our main liveblog is covering all the details: Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says Donald Trump needs to flesh out his economics plans, fast. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Mann says Trump needs to set out policies to identify sources of growth in the US economy, and make sure the benefits are shared fairly between the American people. That\u2019s what got him to the White House , the fact that the gains aren\u2019t widely shared. The deputy leader of Germany\u2019s governing CDU party, Michael Fuchs, hopes that president Trump will be more responsible than nominee Trump: The copper prices has hit its highest level since July 2015, up 5% today, thanks to Trump\u2019s promise to rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure. And shares in two mining companies, Antofagasta and Vedanta, have both soared by 14% as investors anticipate a new fiscal boost next year. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, says copper is the \u2018big winner\u2019 from Trump\u2019s victory (which won\u2019t be much comfort to those on the losing side). He adds: President elect Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to spend more than $500 billion on rebuilding America\u2019sroads, bridges and airports helped send construction and steel stocks sharply higher following his surprise election win. Tom Albanese, chief executive officer of Vedanta Resources, also anticipates a boost. He says (via Blooomberg): All that we see for President-elect Trump is that he will focus on building, he will focus on the infrastructure. \u201cThat is what the market is reacting to.\u201d Trump\u2019s victory is also driving up the shares of military and defence companies. BAE Systems have jumped by 6% this morning, adding to yesterday\u2019s spike following the election result. It\u2019s a sign that the City expect Trump to deliver on his promise to boost spending on the US military (which he claimed had become depleted on president Obama\u2019s watch). BAE is one of the biggest suppliers to the US department of defence, and makes armoured vehicles, ships, fighter jets and missiles. And if Trump weakens the ties between Nato members, then European countries may feel compelled to boost their own armies. Here\u2019s confirmation that inflation expectations are rising, via analyst Arne Petimezas of AFS Group: Predictions that Donald Trump\u2019s policies will drive US inflation higher are causing some dramatic moves in the financial markets today. The interest rate, or yield, on Britain\u2019s 10-year government bonds just jumped over 1.31%, up from 1.23% on Wednesday night. That\u2019s the highest level since 24th June, the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. Other European government bond yields are also rising. Investors are betting that Trump\u2019s tax cuts and debt-fuelled spending plans, if enacted, would be inflationary. So they\u2019re seeking a higher rate of return for holding government debt. The news overnight that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want to force Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to resign has also cheered the markets. Yellen\u2019s first term expires in 2018, but there has been speculation that she might feel pressure to step down, given the attacks from Trump during the campaign. Jim McCaughan, boss of Principal Global Investors, has told Bloomberg TV that market confidence will improve if Yellen stays, adding: If she goes, who knows, because that depends on who comes in next. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson has been giving some more reaction to Trump\u2019s victory at a press conference in Beijing. Asked about Trump\u2019s vows to introduce a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, spokesperson Lu Kang noted that economic ties were blossoming with trade increasing from $2.5bn in 1970 to $560bn last year. \u201cEconomic cooperation between China and the US is what has made our bilateral relations stable and has propelled our bilateral relation forward,\u201d Lu said. \u201cI hope US is able to view our economic trade relationship in an objective and unbiased manner and work with us so that we can move forward. I believe that if the US keeps the country\u2019s interest and its people\u2019s interests in mind, they will make the right decision\u201d. Asked whether such protectionist measures would harm the US-China relationship the spokesperson said: \u201cI will not comment on speculation. As I said I believe that the US\u2019s leaders will make their decision based on the fundamental interests of their people. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to hit a new record high, when the US stock market opens in five hours. Last night, the Dow closed near to its highest levels, and the future market is predicting a fresh spike today. The prospect of tax reforms and a government spending boost are pushing shares up, says Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First. He says the intial Trump slump has swiftly transformed into the Trump jump: The shortening of the timeframe between decline and rebound could be down to many things but issues around full Republican control of the Presidency and the possibility that changes in tax reform, investment and regulation will come through quicker may help. Trump has also been called \u2018an inflation time-bomb\u2019 given his pledges to increase spending so we must now look at Fed policy through a new lens. Similarly, although he was elected yesterday he does not take the reins until January 20th. Well quite: Investors are hoping that taking on the presidency might provoke a change in Donald Trump. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the market rally is based on: ...an reassessment of views about Trump and belief that a more Presidential individual is already replacing the highly divisive candidate character he merely portrayed in order to appeal to American frustration and win the populist vote. Markets are demonstrating an impressive ability to digest significant political change and move on, even quicker than we saw in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. Given some of Trump\u2019s conduct during the election campaign (divisive comments about Muslims, Mexicans, those awful tape-recordings about women...), a transformation by Inauguration Day would be welcome. But is it realistic? Anyone who bought European shares during Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech yesterday morning has made a decent profit. The markets have now gained 4.6% since Wednesday\u2019s opening tumble: European banks are also rallying, on speculation that the next president might unravel some of the regulations brought in since the 2008 crisis. During the campaign, Donald Trump promised to tear up Dodd-Frank -- the legislation brought in to protect consumers and prevent banks becoming too big to fail. Trump believes it is holding back the economy, and once told Fox News that: \u201cWe have to get rid of Dodd-Frank. The banks aren\u2019t loaning to people that need it. The regulators are running the banks.\u201d But it\u2019s not clear what Trump would replace Dodd-Frank with; simply ditching the law could create the conditions that caused the credit crisis in the first place. Coper-producer Antofagasta is the top riser in London, with fellow miners Glencore and Anglo American close behind. Traders are betting that Trump\u2019s programme of cutting taxes, a new debt-funded infrastructure programme, would push up inflation and raise demand for commodities. European markets are open, and shares are rising, as predictions of a Trump slump are trampled in an early wave of buying. The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 49 points, or 0.7%, to 6960 in early trading. Mining stocks and financial companies are leading the way. The French CAC, German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB have also gained around 0.7% to 0.9%. The City analysts who predicted markets would slump if Trump pulled off a shock win have some explaining to do today. The consensus view was that Trump\u2019s sheer unpredictability, opposition to free trade, bombastic and often-shocking comments - plus the vague and uncosted nature of his proposals - would scare investors out of town. But instead, we got a knee-jerk selloff yesterday, followed very swiftly by a bounceback (which Asia just caught up with.) It\u2019s a lesson to all of us about how markets react, as Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Buy the rumour, sell the news or in this case, sell the rumour and buy the news. We were all told this when we first arrived in dealing rooms and it is used to explain why academics and non-market participants are so often confused by the reaction of markets to events. I\u2019m not sure I can remember a better example of this maxim than the last week\u2019s market reaction to changing speculation about the outcome of the US Presidential election, and then to what happened. The result is plenty of egg on the face of all sorts of people. Mine included. So instead, investors quickly began reassessing the implications of a Trump presidency, and a Republican-controlled Congress. Kit says: It is widely expected that President Trump will be able to enact tax cuts, particularly for corporations, that will be positive for growth and will boost inflation. It may not be that simple for Trump to get things done -- the Tea Party wing won\u2019t like the thought of a debt-fuelled stimulus plan, for starters. Good morning from London, where bleary-eyed traders have returned to their desks. We\u2019re not expecting a repeat of the huge rally seen in Asia overnight - London had its Trump rally yesterday afternoon. But the markets are still expected to rise, as the City continues to defy expectations and take yesterday\u2019s shock election result in its stride. You might have thought that the sight of anti-Trump demonstrations at several major US cities overnight would alarm the markets. But right now, they\u2019re more interested in the next president\u2019s promise of a fiscal stimulus. Also, the graceful and mature way that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama reacted to Trump\u2019s win has also calmed nerves -- investors like a peaceful transfer of power. A huge recovery on Asia Pacific\u2019s stock markets as the region followed the lead of the US and Europe. Plenty of commentators have doubts about whether the upbeat impact of Trump\u2019s victory can be sustained across the region but the impact is overwhelmingly positive for now. Here are the main points of the day so far: Share markets had one of their best days for years. The Nikkei rose 6.72% thanks to a weaker yen while the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia was up 3.34%. South Korea, Hong Kong and China all up too Europe and the US due to open up The US dollar dipped slightly from Wednesday\u2019s highs to 105.2740 Japanese yen while US bond yields spiked amid expectation of Fed rate hike in December Trump won\u2019t force Janet Yellen to quit, the WSJ reports China fixes the yuan at its lowest for six years while JP Morgan warns of possible trade shock S&amp;P affirms US AA+/A-1+ rating amid concern about Trump\u2019s \u2018inexperience\u2019 Construction commodities surge with iron ore at 30-month high and copper at 16-month high Thanks for reading \u2013 the indefatigable Graeme Wearden will take the reins from London in a moment. Oliver Holmes, our south-east Asia correspondent, has been looking at the impact of Trump\u2019s win on his business interests in the region. Oliver writes: Despite the global downturn, two companies in the Philippines and Indonesia that are linked to Trump saw their shares soar on news that he had been elected president. Shares in a Philippine firm building a 57-storey Trump Tower in Manila jumped by a massive 20%, from 1.22 to 1.47 US cents on the local stock market. The main index on the Philippine Stock Exchange fell, however, by 2.5%. In Indonesia, shares in a company controlled by Trump\u2019s local business partner, tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo, also surged by 23%. The Jakarta stock exchange dropped by 1.4% on Wednesday. Trump and Tanoesoedibjo plan to build a resort and a golf course in west Java, projects that many in Indonesia \u2014 the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation \u2014 condemned last year when Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. A huge day for the Japanese stock market which soared 1,092.88 points to 17,344.42, a rise of 6.72%. There have been big moves in the bond markets in the past 24 hours as investors have dumped the safety of government paper in favour of equities and the dollar. Yields on US Treasury 10-year notes reversed an initial plunge to 1.716% and bolted to 2.09% overnight as the price of bonds dropped. The net rise of 21 basis points was the largest daily increase since July 2013, Reuters said. There\u2019s also an expectation that the Fed will raise rates in December, with a possible US fiscal stimulus seeing the return of inflation and more rate rises. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. Futures trading suggests Europe and the US will rejoin the party when the markets open later today. Spread better IG sees the FTSE100 up 0.5% at 6940 points, while the Dax in Germany will be up 0.68% at 10,715 points. The Dow Jones on Wall Street is set to open up around 60 points. The Nikkei has gone even better than the ASX today with a rise nearly 7%, helped by a drop in the yen as the US dollar received a Trump bump as we might now have to call it. But the authorities are still worried that they might have to act to keep the yen down in future. Hiroshi Watanabe, former vice finance minister for international affairs, told Reuters that \u201cif the yen spikes by 3 yen or more, Japan should not hesitate to intervene\u201d, regardless of US concerns about such action. If Japan hesitated to intervene out of deference (to Trump), it would not be able to act for the coming four years. Japan has not intervened in currency markets since Nov. 2011. It\u2019s been a good day for investors down under \u2013 the best in fact since 2011, AAP reports. The ASX/S&amp;P200 has closed up 172.2 points, or 3.34%, at 5,328.8 points, adding $50bn to the market\u2019s value, more than making up for yesterday\u2019s losses. Mining and construction stocks led the way on hopes of a boom in the US. Surging iron ore prices also helped, soaring past the 2016 peak to $71 a tonne. Copper \u2013 a key construction material \u2013 also jumped 4% to a 16-month high, Reuters reported. There\u2019s a lot of commentary around today about Trump\u2019s trade policies and what they will mean for the global economy. We\u2019ve already heard from JP Morgan and Saul Eslake. And here\u2019s Paul Bloxham from HSBC in Australia, speaking to Australian Associated Press. For Australia, the main negative impact seems likely to be the effect that reduced global trade could have on Asian growth, given Asia\u2019s high trade reliance. Continued strengthening of Australia\u2019s economic ties to China should be a priority as it would help support local growth even in the face of rising global trade protectionism. But Standard Life, in a research note quoted by AAP, saw the possibility that Trump could moderate his campaign promises, which included putting tariffs of 45% on Chinese goods and 35% on Mexican goods, in order to avoid disruption. It is plausible that the new administration will not ramp up tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, content instead to bury the prospect of new trade agreements and make more use of enforcement clauses in existing agreements. Trump won\u2019t force Janet Yellen to resign as chair of the Federal Reserve, according to an adviser, despite speculation that he might try to end her term prematurely. Judy Shelton, an economist and senior fellow at the Atlas Network and adviser to Trump on monetary policy, told the Wall Street Journal that \u201che\u2019s not urging her to resign at all\u201d. However, the Journal reports that Shelton did concede that Trump was minded to replace Yellen when she completes her first term in 2018. He\u2019s saying he\u2019d want someone whose thinking is more in keeping with his own. Trump was openly critical of Yellen in one of the presidential debates in September, saying that interest rates had been kept too low and that asset bubbles created by loose monetary settings would eventually burst. JP Morgan\u2019s team in Australia have been looking at what Trump\u2019s win could mean for the global economy \u2013 and Australia\u2019s. They say that a US fiscal stimulus would have limited benefits for the rest of the world while trade barriers could mean trouble for trading partners. A US policy-induced trade shock will be negative for global growth. This leaves risks to global growth more asymmetric than was previously the case. Second, the distribution of risks to Chinese growth have shifted to the downside, given the increased probability of rising tensions in US-China trade relations and weaker Chinese export growth. A trade shock could in turn damage the US. A marked slowing in US growth might not be an issue, except that growth in the rest of the global economy doesn\u2019t look robust enough \u2013 particularly given limited scope for additional policy support \u2013 to provide much of a buffer. And even in the event that US growth slows on a trade shock, this will likely be more inflationary (via higher import prices) than would have otherwise been the case, meaning that the growth and inflation trade-off in the US becomes less favourable. And that means that interest rate cuts are back on the horizon in Australia. For the RBA, we think this underscores the risk that rates are likely to go lower in Australia. All else equal, domestic growth needs to be stronger to provide an offset to external shocks, should they occur. US billionaire Carl Icahn apparently cashed in on the stock market panic over Trump\u2019s election victory. The longtime Trump supporter told CNN Money that he left the Republican\u2019s victory party in Manhattan in the early hours of Wednesday to go home and buy \u201ca lot of stock\u201d in the plunging overnight market. I\u2019m glad I did that. I guess that\u2019s what makes me happy today too ... I personally don\u2019t believe that Trump is bad for the market necessarily. OK, the stock markets have proceeded magisterially today despite a background of major tectonic shifts in the financial landscape. Here are the main points: Asia Pacfic shares have bounced back up strongly and recovered Wednesday\u2019s losses. Japan\u2019s Nikkei is up 5.71% at 17,178.87 ASX/S&amp;P200 up 2.74% at 5,297.70, Kospi is at 1,995.75 (1.91%) Hong Kong is up 2% at 22,863.10. The US dollar has dipped against the yen at 105.3270 but still up strongly overnight. Aussie dollar is up at US76.61c S&amp;P has maintained the US on AA+ investment grade rating, warning that Trump\u2019s inexperience creates uncertainty about policy settings Yuan fix at the lowest point since 2010 Reserve Bank of New Zealand has cut rates to 1.75%, a new record low Brent crude is down 7% amid warnings about global trade More on the implications for Asia\u2019s big emerging economies \u2013 and Australia. Saul Eslake, the independent economist, has warned about the implications for Asutralia if Trump were to start a trade war with China and undermine the Fed, pushing the US dollar down. [This would create] a great deal of uncertainty in our part of the world, about the geopolitical environment by making a less wholesome commitment to longstanding US alliances with countries like South Korea and Japan ... Those things, particulary a trade war with China, would be highly negative for Australia. Like every measure in the last 24 hours, the US dollar has been topsy-turvy. The chance of a Fed rate cut dropped to 30% on Wednesday but is now more than 80%, according to IG. The dollar index against major currencies recovered from 95.885 on Wednesday to around 98.448 on Thursday. But the longer-term outlook is uncertain as Trump pushes his protectionist agenda (see below). Tim Condon, an Singapore-based economist at ING, told Reuters: We expect a Trump Treasury to elevate the importance of the bilateral trade surplus with the US in identifying currency manipulators and intensify pressure on trade partners to allow currencies to appreciate. The yuan has been fixed today at 6.7885 \u2013 its lowest point since September 2010. Bearing in mind that Trump labelled China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d on his way to winning the presidency, the issue could prove to be a flashpoint between the two countries. China has pushed the value of its currency steadily downwards in the past year \u2013 very clumsily to begin with, sparking last year\u2019s mini-stock market crash \u2013 as it tries to export its way out of slowing economic growth. But everyone else has got the same idea (including Abe of course). The US dollar is holding its gains on Thursday and was sitting at 105.32 yen, up from below 102 on Wednesday. But for Trump\u2019s manufacturing recovery to work you expect that he will want it come down. The Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe is planning to meet the US president-elect in New York on 17 November, a Japanese government official has said. Reuters reports that the pair had \u201ctalked by telephone and confirmed close cooperation between their two nations\u201d. It might be interesting to hear what they have to say to each other about trade and the economy. Like China, Japan has a lot to be worried about. Trump is an avowed opponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal which would be a huge blow for Abe\u2019s plans to boost his country\u2019s huge manufacturing sector. The commodities market is looking slightly different to stocks today. While equities are surging ahead, the price of oil has dropped amid concerns about the impact of Trump on global trade. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 20c at $45.07 a barrel at 0131 GMT on Thursday. The more widely traded Brent was at $46.29 per barrel, down 7% from the last close. Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of the IHS Markit think tank, told Reuters: The outcome of the U.S. election adds to the challenges for the oil exporters because it will likely lead to weaker economic growth in an already fragile global economy. And that means additional pressure on oil demand. Gold meanwhile dipped overnight $1,278.25 an ounce as risk receded in the markets. It rose nearly 5% to $1,337.40 on Wednesday before tumbling back down as US markets reacted positively to the Trump win. Reuters reports that S&amp;P, the ratings agency, has affirmed the country\u2019s investment-grade AA+/A-1+ sovereign rating on Wednesday while maintaining its stable outlook. It welcomed calls for unity from all sides of US politics in the wake of Trump\u2019s win but \u201chigh general government debt and increased uncertainty\u201d meant there it could not restore the coveted AAA rating it removed in 2011. Its analysis feels like a good summary of market sentiment: Given Mr Trump\u2019s lack of experience in public office, and his win as a political outsider without an established policy track record, there is a degree of uncertainty over policy formulation and execution. However, there is a difference between campaign rhetoric and concrete policy proposals and execution once in office. We await further information on the formation of a cabinet and policy proposals, particularly once the president-elect assumes office. Alongside Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, the Senate remains in Republican hands, as does the House of Representatives. Hence, the president-elect and the Republicans have a mandate for and ability to effect policy change more easily than with a more divided government in recent years. Trading has been underway for an hour now in Japan and Korea. Here\u2019s where the main indexes stand: Nikkei up 5.7% to 17,180 points Kospi in South Korea up 1.7% to 1,991 ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia up 2.88% to 5,305 points The yen, which gained so much during yesterday\u2019s turmoil, fell sharply overnight as the US dollar recovered. It\u2019s now at 105.6740, close to a four-month high. The pound and the euro are both down slightly against the greenback however, as the pattern from yesterday is reversed. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac in Australia, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand hasn\u2019t waited around to see what a Trump presidency might mean for US monetary policy \u2013 it cut its base rate 25 basis points to a record low of 1.75% this morning. The move was expected and is the third cut this year. It\u2019s driven partly by a need to get the NZ dollar down to help the country\u2019s huge dairy industry. Governor Graeme Wheeler said the rate-setters had met on Thursday to discuss whether the cut was still needed in the wake of Trump\u2019s win. They decided it was but pushed back on expectations of yet another reduction soon. He said: We think at this stage that we won\u2019t need another cut. The economy is doing well and you certainly wouldn\u2019t want to create excessive volatility in respect of interest rates and output in the exchange rate by surprising the market with interest rate adjustments. This is an interesting chart. Wednesday saw one of the biggest drops in volatility ever recorded as the markets quickly put their concerns behind them and went into risk-on mode. But as with Australia, it\u2019s not clear where this is going. A Trump presidency promises a more aggressive US trading position which the markets have implicitly welcomed. But not everyone can be winners here, can they? China is the obvious loser in Asia if, let\u2019s say, Trump tries to force Apple to make its iPhones in the US instead of Shenzhen and Shangahi. Here\u2019s a snippet from Larry Elliott\u2019s piece: Beijing would have two choices. It might take an emollient line, promising to increase direct investment into the US as a way of supporting Trump\u2019s attempt to rebuild the American economy. More likely, though, China would adopt an aggressive, nationalistic stance. Beijing is not without economic weapons, since it has amassed a vast stock of US Treasury bonds in recent years, the proceeds of its trade surplus with America. Beijing could meet Trump\u2019s threat with one of its own: to dump US assets. A tit-for-tat trade war, in which China puts tariffs on US exports, could not be ruled out either. But as Chris Weston from IG says in his morning note, these concerns appear for another day as markets focus on the upside: Like many I had been concerned market participants would be worried about Trump\u2019s relationship with the Federal Reserve and a number of their key trade partners (such as China and Japan), but again this concern is for another time it seems. The market in Japan has opened very strongly with the Nikkei rising more than 6%, reversing the huge losses of Wednesday. The Kospi in Seoul is also up. The Aussie dollar has risen this morning from overnight lows of below US76c as the markets yo-yoed around during US election night. The Aussie is trading at US76.50c this morning. But experts say it\u2019s hard to say where it will go from here given the mixed bag of signals out of a Trump win. Here\u2019s Greg McKenna writing at axitrader.com: I think if Trump delivers on his campaign promises then we face a more volatile global economic and geopolitical environment in the years ahead ... For the Aussie that means it benefits from the reflationary aspects of Trumponomics, but could suffer from the rise in US bonds, and likely Fed hike in December if Australian interest rate markets don\u2019t go with those moves higher. Huge lead from Australia this morning. The ASX/S&amp;P200 is up nearly 3% and resource and financial stocks have led the way. The iron ore producer Fortescue is the top riser at well over 10.6% but Macquarie and BHP have also shown big gains. My colleague Melissa Davey has just filed this report on the morning\u2019s surge. Meanwhile, Chris Weston at IG in Melbourne has this: The combination of huge gains in materials, fiscals and energy should push the ASX 200 3.4%, which if it closes at that level would be the strongest gain since 6 October 2011 Hello and welcome to the markets live blog from Sydney. Well, that didn\u2019t turn out quite how it was expected to \u2013 on a number of levels. The surprise of Trump\u2019s win looked like leading to market meltdown across the world. But it didn\u2019t, thanks in part it seems to Trump\u2019s conciliatory speech, proving that investors hate uncertainty more than anything. The promise of a smooth handover of power, a united Congress, tax cuts and a huge infrastructure spending boost was enough to turn red screens green. Here\u2019s how they finished in the US and Europe The Dow Jones up 1.4% to 18,590 points. The S&amp;P 500 up 1.1% to 21,163. The Nasdaq up 1.1% to 5,251. FTSE100 up 1% to 6,911.84 Dax up 1.56% to 10,646 In Australia the market has already taken that lead and opened up by nearly 3%. Can it be sustained? Here\u2019s one informed verdict. Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets in Sydney, said: The stunning turn in sentiment suggests there is now a consensus building that much of the policy announced during the campaign was a sales pitch rather than a commitment to act. Investors ignored the potential for damage to international trade and growth prospects and focussed on Republican control of both houses of Congress as well as the White House. This offers the prospect of reform that could stimulate the US economy. However, last night\u2019s action may be as good as it gets for markets for some time. Policy uncertainty and populist agendas rarely lead to sustainable economic growth. There\u2019s much to look at and talk about. But in the meantime start with our economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s examination of what a Trump win might mean for the global economy.",

Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. </p> <p>No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u2013 notably, the US Federal Reserve.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flanders points out that Trump\u2019s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>And remember, Trump\u2019s success or failure won\u2019t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is about the kind of country that America wants to be.</p> <p>At the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be judged.

Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his ability to define himself as a \u201cwinner\u201d will require a different approach, and most of his pre-election proposals will be modified.<br></li> <li><strong>The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the hours following the victory.</strong> There was much dissent even within the party, but a \u201cclean-sweep\u201d soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll. Adversaries within the party, such as Paul Ryan, recognise that their own careers will be cut short if they fail to mend the wounds and push the agenda forward.<br></li> <li><strong>Expectations that the cabinet in a Trump presidency may hold unusual power</strong>, and that the markets must wait to assess who is appointed before jumping to conclusions.<br></li> <li><strong>For the markets, the recognition that stimulative policy still carries with it expansionary benefits,</strong> irrespective of the presidential qualifications or likeability of the man putting the ideas forward.<br></li> </ol> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-10T15:00:47.577Z\">at 3.00pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-582489f6e4b051849de87cc8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-10T14:57:56.763Z\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Banks stocks are rallying this morning, with JP Morgan up 4% and Goldman Sachs gaining 2%.<br></strong></p> <p>They\u2019re benefitting from speculation that the Republicans could ditch Dodd-Frank, the legislation brought in to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis.</p> <p>Pharmaceutical stocks are up too, with <strong>Pfizer</strong> gaining 3.6%.

Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate. I\u2019m not so sure.</p> <p>To adapt a a phrase: \u201cdemagogues can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u201d.</p> <p>Still, as a base case a meaningful fiscal easing seems likely. Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u2014 they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks use<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/laffer-curve-napkin-doodle-launched-supply-side-economics\">back of the napkin logic</a> to tell themselves \u201cthese tax cuts will pay for themselves\u201d. (Actually they won\u2019t).</p> </blockquote> <p>But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u2019s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u2019s Presidency could bring about \u2014 a rejection of \u201cglobalisation\u201d/economic openness.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 to achieve.</p> <p>There\u2019s lots more here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/796698770138419201\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Post: Political Economy &amp;

Beijing could meet Trump\u2019s threat with one of its own: to dump US assets. <strong>A tit-for-tat trade war, in which China puts tariffs on US exports, could not be ruled out either.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>But as Chris Weston from IG says in his morning note, these concerns appear for another day as markets focus on the upside:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like many I had been concerned market participants would be worried about Trump\u2019s relationship with the Federal Reserve and a number of their key trade partners (such as China and Japan), but again this concern is for another time it seems.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5823bbc5e4b0199b938954d1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-10T00:23:23.683Z\">12.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Japanese stocks up 6%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The market in Japan has opened very strongly with the <strong>Nikkei rising more than 6%</strong>, reversing the huge losses of Wednesday. </p> <p>The <strong>Kospi in Seoul is also up</strong>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sludgehound/status/796506020717723648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">TOKYO&#39;S NIKKEI SHARE AVERAGE  EXTENDS GAINS, UP 6.00 PCT</p>&mdash; sludgehound (@sludgehound) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sludgehound/status/796506020717723648\">November 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cnbcSri/status/796505973800177664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JAPAN?src=hash\">#JAPAN</a>: Nikkei 225 cruises past 17,000, closing in on 6 percent gains early session <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NKY&amp;src=ctag\">$NKY</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDJPY&amp;src=ctag\">$USDJPY</a></p>&mdash; Sri Jegarajah (@cnbcSri) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cnbcSri/status/796505973800177664\">November 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5823b96be4b0822c310ec906\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-10T00:13:51.026Z\">12.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Aussie dollar has risen this morning from overnight lows of below US76c as the markets yo-yoed around during US election night. </p> <p><strong>The Aussie is trading at US76.50c this morning. </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99a6946b55ddd1a7bbcccd9a4ba5a5a04907ae72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99a6946b55ddd1a7bbcccd9a4ba5a5a04907ae72/290_0_2695_1618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Aussie dollar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Aussie dollar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But experts say it\u2019s hard to say where it will go from here given the mixed bag of signals out of a Trump win.</p> <p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.axitrader.com/au/market-news-blog/market-analysis/2016/11/the-aussie-dollar-bounced-off-support-again-overnight-whats-next\">Greg McKenna writing at axitrader.com</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think if Trump delivers on his campaign promises then we face a more volatile global economic and geopolitical environment in the years ahead ... <strong>For the Aussie that means it benefits from the reflationary aspects of Trumponomics</strong>, <strong>but could</strong> <strong>suffer from the rise in US bonds</strong>, and likely Fed hike in December if Australian interest rate markets don\u2019t go with those moves higher.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5823b68be4b0eda0192fe02f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-10T00:01:22.732Z\">12.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Australian shares up nearly 3%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Huge lead from Australia this morning.

      "bodyText": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high on Thursday, rising more than 200 points as traders continued to absorb Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential race. Investors have been warned to brace for more sharp moves on financial markets as uncertainty endures over how Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric will translate into policies. But after initially struggling to find direction on Thursday the Dow closed up 218 points at 18807, a rise of 1.17%. The S&amp;P 500 also gained slightly, rising 0.2% but the tech-heavy Nasdaq dipped 0.81%. Trump has clashed with Silicon Valley and threatened Apple, Nasdaq and the world\u2019s largest company, over privacy and its overseas manufacturing. Apple dropped 2.79% on Thursday. Markets benefitted from a continuing sense of relief over Trump\u2019s conciliatory tone in his early remarks, including those following his meeting with the US president, Barack Obama. However European shares, including London\u2019s FTSE 100 index, could not hold on to their early gains as worries grew over the president-elect\u2019s coming longer term impact on global growth due to his protectionist policies. The billionaire businessman vowed on the campaign trail to put American jobs first and scrap or renegotiate trade deals. European markets were also hurt by investors moving their money out of shares and into bonds as yields rose on the prospect that the arrival of a big spender in the White House would mean the US had to issue more government debt. A new flurry of bonds coming on to the market would push down the price of bonds, and yields would move inversely to prices. \u201cIt has been another interesting day for the FTSE 100, with the index retreating from the morning high, hit by heavy losses for high dividend stocks, which are looking less attractive after the pickup in US bond yields,\u201d said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the online trading company IG. The FTSE 100 closed down 1.2% at 6827.98, having gained 1% on Wednesday after Trump\u2019s presidential victory was confirmed. Analysts said the FTSE\u2019s change in direction during the day Thursday reflected a sense of confusion over whether Trump would match tough talk during the presidential race with action once in power. \u201cIt is perhaps apt that the reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s victory has been so confused, flipping between bombast and baloney much in the same manner as the soon-to-be president,\u201d said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at the spread betting firm Spreadex. \u201cThat\u2019s all well and good for the short-term, especially for those traders looking to benefit from the present volatility; one suspects the seemingly rudderless movements may soon wear thin, however.\u201d There were clear winners and losers from Trump\u2019s presidential victory. His vows to ramp up spending on defence and infrastructure boosted stocks in the defence, construction and commodity sector. The prospect of looser regulation lifted shares in banks. Analysts said more muddled days of trading lay ahead as investors continued to weigh the potential impact of a Trump presidency on different stocks, sectors and regions as well as on the global economy as a whole. \u201cGlobal growth could be somewhat slower in the years ahead if protectionism takes hold. The additional uncertainty will have a negative impact on equity markets but the extent needs to be kept in perspective,\u201d said Glyn Owen at Momentum Global Investment Management. \u201cOn balance we believe that markets will drift for a period in the face of the uncertainty and the increased volatility we have seen in recent weeks will be a feature for the year ahead.\u201d On currency markets there was some respite for the pound as it jumped to a six-week high against the euro and rose against the dollar. Traders put the small recovery in the pound \u2013 which has tumbled since the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU \u2013 down to political worries now shifting to mainland Europe. A series of elections are due in Europe next year with the Dutch, French and Germans going to the polls, and possibly the Italians too if their government loses a key referendum next month. After Trump\u2019s win there are predictions that populist movements in those countries will gain further ground. Against that backdrop the pound was up 1.5% against a flagging euro, to \u20ac1.1537 in late trading. The pound was up 1.4% against the dollar to $1.2578. That in turn put further pressure on the FTSE 100. The internationally diverse stock index has benefited from the pound\u2019s post-referendum weakness because it has flattered the earnings of those component companies that report in dollars.",

      "bodyText": "American investors seem naively trusting of President-elect Trump\u2019s economic plans. On one hand, they say those wild campaign pledges to slap stiff tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports in pursuit of the most protectionist US trade policy since the 1930s should not be taken too literally. On the other, they conclude that a Trump presidency definitely means heavy investment in infrastructure, which will be excellent news for all those suppliers of raw materials and equipment needed to upgrade roads, bridges, schools, tunnels, electricity networks and so on. Both thoughts are understandable, of course. Even Trump has never been firm on the idea of 45% tariffs on China. It was a threat \u201cif they don\u2019t behave,\u201d he said during one debate, \u201cit doesn\u2019t have to be 45%, it could be less\u201d. Plenty of scope there to water down the policy. Yet the pledge to spend $1tn on new infrastructure is being taken as if it is firm, irreversible and a gift from Washington. Look at the share prices of some London-listed companies that could, potentially, benefit. BHP Billiton, the world\u2019s largest miner, is up 15% this week. So is Ashtead, which rents out mechanical equipment in the US. The optimism looks to be a case of too much, too soon. Remember, Trump has not pledged to splurge $1tn of pure federal money. Such a policy would indeed be a financial gift for many sectors. But any president, even one whose party controls both houses of Congress, would struggle to get such a programme of massive expansion approved by the fiscal hawks. It seems far more likely that Trump\u2019s $1tn figure refers to money he hopes other people will provide, albeit encouraged by tax breaks and partnerships. It all counts in the end, of course, but marshalling public-private partnerships on such a grand scale is time-consuming work and the US market is underdeveloped compared to Europe. Nor, as Trump will find, is private capital inclined to shoulder many risks before opening its wallet: it tends to demand rock-solid, inflation-proof returns, as the UK as learned to its cost. For now, investors seem happy to celebrate the direction of travel. Fair enough, there seems to be a broad consensus in the US that an infrastructure upgrade is required. But it\u2019s the small print that will matter. Investors would be well advised to believe the $1tn figure only when they know what it is. Why drugmakers need to take a chill pill In similar vein, investors in healthcare stocks should curb their enthusiasm. Hillary Clinton, who had pledged to cap drug prices, will not be entering the White House but it\u2019s hard to know what Trump\u2019s changes imply. Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, has the right idea. While it is safe to assume that Obamacare will be scrapped or heavily modified, \u201cnobody knows what the new landscape will look like\u201d. AstraZeneca\u2019s shareholders know the feeling: Soriot keeps telling them that \u201can inflection point\u201d is arriving, meaning a return to sales growth. In the meantime, they must live with the reality of competition from generic manufacturers to the group\u2019s cholesterol pill, Crestor. Thursday\u2019s figures revealed the generic effect is every bit as severe as feared. ITV\u2019s slide: structural upheaval or a hiccup? In some corners of the media world, such as newspapers, 20% annual declines in advertising revenues \u2013 at least in print \u2013 have become the norm in the digital age. Commercial television has suffered nothing similar but here comes a figure to make you wonder: ITV expects its advertising revenues to fall 7% in the final quarter of this year. For 2016 as a whole, that implies a slip of 3%, the first annual decline since 2009. The start of structural upheaval or just a hiccup? For the time being, ITV deserves the benefit of the doubt. If one takes a grand sweep, television still claims about 26% of all advertising spending in the UK, roughly the same as a decade ago. ITV\u2019s chief executive, Adam Crozier, can also say, fairly, that the company these days is less of a hostage to the UK advertising market. ITV Studios, the production business, sells programmes such as Victoria and Poldark around the world. That is one reason why full-year earnings for 2016 will roughly match last year\u2019s. Yet the outlook for the ad market still drives the share price, which is down by a third since the EU referendum was called in February. If ad buyers\u2019 confidence returns in the new year, long-term shareholders have nothing to worry about. But ITV is at a crucial juncture. It has showered investors with dividends, including specials, for the past three years. Judge Crozier\u2019s true level of confidence only when he reveals next year whether he thinks he can sustain the generosity.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Pensions Regulator is seeking millions of pounds from Dominic Chappell and Retail Acquisitions in relation to the \u00a3571m deficit in the BHS pension scheme. Sources close to the situation say warning notices sent by the regulator to Chappell and his company show it wants to receive \u201cmultiples of \u00a31m\u201d. The regulator has started legal proceedings against the former BHS owners Chappell and Sir Philip Green in an attempt to fill the pension deficit. The exact details of the regulator\u2019s claims are unclear. Any party that reveals the details of the warning notice sent to them risks breaking the law. The claims against Chappell and Retail Acquisitions are likely to relate to the amount of money they took out of BHS and the sale of assets during their 13 months as owners of the department store chain. The parliamentary committee that investigated the demise of BHS accused Chappell of having \u201chis fingers in the till\u201d and helping oversee the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of the retailer. Retail Acquisitions, which is 90% owned by Chappell, collected an estimated \u00a317m from BHS after buying it for \u00a31 from Green in March 2015. The company sold off BHS\u2019s flagship store on Oxford Street and its warehouse in Atherstone, Warwickshire, with some of the proceeds used to pay off a loan Retail Acquisitions had taken out. The regulator is seeking about \u00a3300m from Green, but its legal claim against Chappell is significant and raises further questions about how well BHS was managed under his ownership. While Green is a billionaire tycoon, Chappell is a serial bankrupt. BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs. Green controlled the retailer between 2000 and 2015, during which time his family and other shareholders collected more than \u00a3580m. The regulator announced last week that it had sent warning notices to Green, Chappell and their respective companies, Taveta and Retail Acquisitions. The regulator has not disclosed any of the details in the warning notices, but they run to more than 300 pages and explain why it believes the parties are liable to financially support the BHS pension scheme. The notices are understood to set a range for the financial contribution sought from Green and Chappell, rather than a single figure. The pair have about six months to reply to the regulator and set out their case. When they do, a determinations panel at the regulator, which is independent of the investigations team, will decide whether they have to make a contribution and how much it should be. The regulator launched an anti-avoidance investigation into BHS in March 2015 after it was sold. The regulator has trawled through nearly 100,000 documents and held talks with the parties involved. Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the Pension Regulator, has said she is still open to agreeing a settlement over the scheme\u2019s funding. Last week, she said the warning notices had been issued after a \u201ccomplex investigation\u201d and the regulator was yet to receive a \u201csufficiently credible and comprehensive offer\u201d to bail out the BHS pension scheme, which has more than 20,000 members. The scheme is currently in an assessment period with the Pension Protection Fund. If a deal or settlement with Green cannot be reached, the scheme will eventually enter the PPF, where the members\u2019 benefits will be cut by at least 10%. In June, Green told MPs he would sort the problems facing the scheme. However, no deal has been forthcoming and the tycoon was photographed on his new yacht during the summer. Last month, the House of Commons voted unanimously to strip Green of his knighthood, which was awarded a decade ago for services to retail. During a fiery debate in parliament, Green was lambasted and described as a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d. The vote is advisory, as the power to rescind a knighthood rests with the honours forfeiture committee, a group of civil servants and dignitaries. Pensions experts have warned that a legal battle about the BHS scheme could take years. Although the regulator can legally force Green and Chappell to make a payment, they can take an appeal against such a decision to the supreme court. The regulator and Chappell declined to comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Productivity growth is always a major economic issue, but is often mired in political bun fighting over calls for greater industrial relations flexibility. This week the Productivity Commission released a discussion paper seeking ideas for how to improve productivity but which pointedly asked for new ideas. It\u2019s not surprising the Productivity Commission thinks productivity is pretty important. They do perhaps over-egg the pudding in their latest discussion paper out this week, where they open by suggesting that \u201cthere is a justified global anxiety that growth in productivity ... has slowed or stopped\u201d. Global anxiety might be a bit much (as Ross Gittins noted, there are a few other issues to be anxious about, such as climate change), but there is no doubting that productivity growth is important. It\u2019s important because by and large national income rests on productivity growth. Until Australia had a massive boost in the value of our exports in the mid-2000s, the ABS\u2019s measure of \u201cnational wellbeing\u201d of real net national disposable income grew in line with labour productivity: The problem, as the Productivity Commission notes, is that we can\u2019t rely on a boom in iron ore and coal prices to fuel our income growth into the future. So it means we need to think about productivity growth \u2013 especially as it has slowed in the past decade: The Productivity Commission suggests that the boom in export prices hid much of the problem for Australia. The paper notes that instead of a sharp fall in national income via our slowing of productivity growth, there has just been an \u201cinexorable slowing towards reduced opportunity, greater dispute over shares of a smaller than expected pie, and selective protection\u201d. And this brings into focus the \u201cglobal anxiety\u201d the Productivity Commission talks of, because in Australia \u2013 as around the world \u2013 productivity growth has slowed in the past decade. It\u2019s nice perhaps to know that we are not alone in having this problem. Canadian and Australian productivity growth is pretty much in step over the past 40 years \u2013 and both saw a big surge in the 1990s and then a sharp slowing in the 2000s: Given this, it does also highlight that the solution to productivity growth is not just a company tax cut or a change to our workplace relations system. If that were the case you would expect to see significant difference between Australia and the rest of the world, but in fact we\u2019re suffering much the same as others, just as we did as well as others in the 1990s. The issue for the Productivity Commission involves the breakdown of labour productivity. Essentially, labour productivity growth derives from three aspects. The first is \u201ccapital deepening\u201d which is essentially the increase of investment in capital per worker. Usually this is broken down into two groups \u2013 IT and non-IT, and derives from the assumption that more capital, such as computers or machinery, enables workers to be more productive. The second aspect is labour composition which looks at the skill level of workers \u2013 under the assumption that more skillful workers will be more productive. The final aspect is multi-factor productivity which looks at the ability of labour to make use of that capital. And this is where we see the biggest problem for productivity during the first decade of this century \u2013 most of the productivity growth came from capital deepening and multi-factor productivity actually went backwards: Now, it is not all bad \u2013 a major reason for the fall was the mining industry. The massive mining boom in the 2000s actually reduced productivity because it was much more labour intensive than the industry had previously been. And as we now move to the export phase, which is much less labour intensive, that aspect will be reverse somewhat. But the Productivity Commission suggests just hoping that will solve all the problems is perhaps wishful thinking. And it also has some other issues \u2013 namely, trying to accurately measure productivity growth. The issue is that there are a lot of things in the economy that affect productivity that don\u2019t get measured. The commission notes for example, that washing machines, vacuum cleaners and refrigerators, boosted household productivity in the 20th century and that \u201cfreed up people for employment and leisure\u201d but \u201cthese gains are not captured in official statistics.\u201d Similarly, road congestion lowers the efficiency of people\u2019s personal travel, which is not counted, as well as that of public and commercial transport, which is counted. The commission also notes that while it is great to talk of increasing national income via productivity growth, the distribution of that income is vitally important. The commission notes that \u201cpublic support is more likely for reforms that offer benefits to the bulk of people\u201d. It also notes that while productivity grew during the period, inequality in Australia (as in many OECD countries) increased from the 1990s to 2007. The USA is a perfect example of the issue of worrying about productivity and not inequality \u2013 since the 1980s, the link between productivity growth and worker compensation has completely split. A few years ago, the ACTU also issued a report noting that a similar \u201cdecoupling of productivity and worker earnings\u201d had occurred here since the mining boom. So what to do? The commission is not making recommendations at this stage, it is seeking ideas. Rather wonderfully, however, it has made a plea for \u201cnew and novel ideas because there is already a strong awareness of many reform options that parties would like to see implemented. More of the same is not likely to be helpful\u201d. It\u2019s a good point. Mostly, productivity in this country becomes a fight over industrial relations. With a bit of luck, this new review might bring to light issues that are less easily divided into Labor and Liberal.",

A few years ago, the <a href=\"http://www.actu.org.au/media/297315/Shrinking%20Slice%20of%20the%20Pie%202013%20Final.pdf\">ACTU also issued a report</a> noting that a similar \u201cdecoupling of productivity and worker earnings\u201d had occurred here since the mining boom. </p> <p>So what to do? The commission is not making recommendations at this stage, it is seeking ideas. </p> <p>Rather wonderfully, however, it has made a plea for \u201cnew and novel ideas because there is already a strong awareness of many reform options that parties would like to see implemented. More of the same is not likely to be helpful\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a good point. Mostly, productivity in this country becomes a fight over industrial relations. With a bit of luck, this new review might bring to light issues that are less easily divided into Labor and Liberal.</p>",

Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general, said independent inspectors had found that private prisons \u201ccompare poorly to our own bureau facilities\u201d and did not save substantially on costs. The companies are also likely to benefit from Trump\u2019s plan for the mass deportation of immigrants. Analysts at Height Securities said: \u201cPrivate prisons would likely be a clear winner under Trump, as his administration will probably rescind the DoJ\u2019s contract phase-out and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] capacity to house detainees will come under further stress.\u201d Shares in Corrections of America, the biggest private prison operator, surged by 60% in early trading on Wednesday before ending the day 40% higher. The shares were down 2% on Thursday. Shares in Geo Group, the second biggest private prison company, jumped 16% on Wednesday and were flat on Thursday. Pharmaceuticals During her campaign, Hillary Clinton repeatedly attacked drug companies for \u201coutrageous price gouging\u201d, in which companies buy old drugs and ramp up the price, and pledged to take on the industry if elected. She promised her crackdown during the furore surrounding Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical boss described as \u201cthe world\u2019s most hated man\u201d, who raised the price of a life-saving Aids drug from $13.50 to $750 per pill. She also attacked the EpiPen company, Mylan, which increased the price of the life-saving allergy treatment by sixfold, as the \u201clatest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers\u201d. Clinton\u2019s policy on drug pricing was mostly a reaction to the success of rival Bernie Sanders\u2019 popular message. Shares in Pfizer, the world\u2019s biggest drugmaker, have risen by 10% since the result of the election became clear. The SPDR S&amp;P Biotech exchange-traded fund jumped 10.4%. But hospital stocks were hit by Trump\u2019s vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which has given healthcare access to America\u2019s poorest and previously uninsured people. Shares in hospital groups Centene, HCA Holdings and Universal Health Services were some of the biggest losers on the stock market, as they could once again face treating millions of uninsured patients. Oil, gas and coal Trump has pledged to make America energy independent, tear up red tape and allow oil and gas exploration in new areas of the country. Oil and gas company shares were among the biggest risers on Wall Street on Wednesday and Thursday. The president-elect has also pledged to allow a fresh application for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. President Barack Obama rejected the Canada-US pipeline in 2015, but Trump has said he would invite a fresh proposal from TransCanada, the company behind the plan. Trump has also vowed to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, and wants to halt the \u201cbillions and billion and billions\u201d given to UN climate programmes and clean energy development. This caused shares in Vestas, the Danish wind turbine company, to fall by 14% on Wednesday before recovering to 6.6% lower. Solar power companies also tumbled. Infrastructure, construction and commodity companies Trump has vowed to kickstart a massive infrastructure spending programme, designed to fix the country\u2019s crumbling roads and buildings and also increase jobs and spending. \u201cWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\u201d he said in his acceptance speech. The prospect of all that work has helped shares in companies supplying the construction sector with materials and kit. Caterpillar, the construction equipment company, rose 7% on Wednesday and the shares were trading higher on Thursday. Shares in the mining and commodities trading company Glencore rose 6% and BHP Billiton jumped more than 4% on Wednesday as Trump\u2019s poll victory was confirmed. Shares in US Steel Corp soared 17% on Wednesday and were up again on Thursday. Defence Trump has pledged to increase US defence spending, and he plans to force other Nato countries to spend more on it too. During his campaign for the White House, he threatened to abandon US allies in Europe if they did not spend enough on defence. Now Trump has won the election, investors expect more spending on defence and so shares in arms makers and other defence-related stocks have benefited. London-listed BAE Systems gained almost 7% on Wednesday and a further 4.6% on Thursday. On Wall Street, shares in Lockheed Martin rose 6% on Wednesday and were up again on Thursday.",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary has vowed to stem the flow of \u201cdirty money\u201d into the City of London in an attempt to end its reputation as a safe haven for \u201ccriminals and corrupt kleptocrats\u201d to hide their money. Amber Rudd highlighted a National Crime Agency estimate that \u00a390bn is laundered via London each year. Rudd conceded that the UK has much more work to do to prevent financial crime, which she called a \u201cnational security threat\u201d that costs the UK \u00a324bn a year and undermines its reputation as a place to do business. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned by claims London is a major global money-laundering centre,\u201d Rudd said at a conference hosted by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, on Thursday. \u201cThe UK is attractive to criminals and corrupt kleptocrats who steal billions from their own people, often some of the poorest people in the world. We will reduce the flow of dirty money into the City.\u201d The government last month unveiled its criminal finances bill, detailing measures to make London less attractive to international criminals as a place to launder money. Measures in the bill aimed at money laundering include new unexplained wealth orders, under which people suspected of trying to launder the proceeds of crime will be asked to explain the source of their money. If they cannot, assets such as property can be seized to ensure criminals are unable to launder their cash by investing in property. Rudd also said that an online raid in which hackers stole from thousands of Tesco Bank customers last weekend indicates the UK has yet to \u201cmake a dent\u201d in the growing threat of cybercrime. \u201cThe recent events at Tesco Bank are a stark example of what we face,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that for thousands of hard-working people [...] public confidence in our institutions gets shaken by this sort of event. \u201cThe [Tesco] incident served to demonstrate that the private sector has a crucial role and a responsibility in countering cyber-enabled fraud,\u201d she added. \u201cWhile we have made some good progress and taken some significant steps forward, we haven\u2019t yet put a dent in the problem. The threat remains great and there is very much more to be done.\u201d The FCA\u2019s head of financial crime, Rob Gruppetta, hailed government efforts to tackle financial crime as a \u201cpositive step in the right direction\u201d. But he also proposed a series of measures that the regulator believes would beef up companies\u2019 defences. The measures include a centralised database of suspicious transactions, which could help firms save money on building their own systems and make it easier for them to share data with other firms and law enforcement agencies. Gruppetta also said the government should rethink rules under which officials tasked with reporting suspected money laundering can be held criminally liable for failing to do so. He said this could be doing \u201cmore harm than good\u201d because it leads to overly conservative reporting. Rules that make banks legally liable if they share flawed information on financial crime with rival companies should also be relaxed, he said. The FCA chief executive, Andrew Bailey, called on companies to make the UK a \u201chostile environment\u201d for financial criminals by making better use of technology. The regulator was ticked off by the Treasury select committee earlier this week for the lack of technical experts among its board of directors, particularly in the light of the hack of Tesco Bank.",

Yet on the second day after his election Wall Street investors were in a bullish mood, with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a record high. The Dow rose as much as 191 points to reach 18,780 by 1pm in New York, while the other two main US stock market indexes, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, also climbed. Conner Campbell at financial betting firm SpreadEx said: \u201cBefore [Wednesday] morning Trump was toxic yet now \u2026 he is the biggest turn-on the market has seen in months.\u201d In the days before the vote, share indexes rose when it looked like Hillary Clinton was winning and fell at a hint that Trump could catch her. On 7 November, the day before the election, the Dow had its best day for eight months after the FBI cleared Clinton over her private email server. And on Wednesday markets duly plunged in early trading as Asian and European investors responded to the shock result. But by the time Wall Street opened for business Trump had made a conciliatory acceptance speech in which he promised to heal divisions and work with other countries. After a volatile opening as investors tried to make sense of events, the Dow rose on the day. Shares rose partly on relief at Trump\u2019s tone and the lack of references to erecting trade barriers or a wall across the Mexican border. Trump also rowed back on threats to sack Janet Yellen, who chairs the Federal Reserve central bank. Traders then looked for opportunities. If Trump was going to be more sensible than his campaign pronouncements implied, then what about his policies? Trump has pledged to cut corporation tax, a move all businesses would like. He has promised to cut back regulation and scrap climate change targets, including abandoning the Paris agreement to reduce emissions. Oil and gas shares duly rose. Speculation that the Republicans could ease rules on banks, including scrapping the Dodd-Frank regulations introduced after the 2008 financial crisis to curb risky behaviour, sent bank shares soaring. In his victory speech, Trump talked about putting Americans to work to overhaul the country\u2019s creaking infrastructure. These promises sent shares of mining and construction companies up. Drug companies also rose. Both Trump and Clinton talked about reining in charges for treatments but Clinton was more aggressive and specific. Tom Elliott, an analyst at financial advisers deVere, said a Trump presidency had created opportunities for investors but that they should prepare for a bumpy ride. \u201cTrump\u2019s plans could well increase overall demand in the economy, boost growth and corporate earnings in the near term but result in inflation further down the line. A typical boom and bust scenario may follow.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s presidency could be a shot in the arm for National Grid, the operator of Britain\u2019s electricity network of cables and pylons has said. The president-elect has set out his stall for increased investment in energy infrastructure, a position that could benefit the Grid, which owns gas pipelines and electricity cables in the US. \u201cThe position in terms of Trump is that it\u2019s early days,\u201d said the chief executive, John Pettigrew. \u201cWhat we did see [on Thursday] from the Trump administration is positive statements on the need for investing in infrastructure. If that flows through into policy, that could be good for the energy sector.\u201d Pettigrew said while gas and electricity distribution were regulated at state level in the US, the Grid was likely to benefit from a \u201cpositive atmosphere\u201d around energy infrastructure. Pettigrew was speaking as the company reported a 64% slump in pre-tax profit to \u00a3485m, largely due to the \u00a3700m cost of buying back debt to smooth the sale of a controlling stake in its gas distribution business. The firm repurchased \u00a31.9bn of debt with a high interest rate, a move Pettigrew said would benefit the firm through lower interest payments and bolster the sale price of its gas network. Separating the gas pipelines division from the rest of the business was largely complete, said Pettigrew, adding that the winning bidder could be announced by the turn of the year. A consortium led by China Investment Corporation is understood to be among the leading bidders. Pettigrew also welcomed a consultation launched by the energy regulator Ofgem to make the UK\u2019s power networks more flexible, including the use of technology such as battery storage and demand response \u2013 where firms shift their energy usage to low-demand periods. \u201cAs we move forward, energy markets will be more dynamic and there\u2019s real value for customers if demand side is as active as supply,\u201d he said. The firm recently signed agreements with battery storage firms to provide 200MW of capacity, amid a growing belief that the technology can reduce the need to build new power plants. National Grid won support from Ofgem over criticism of its \u201cmonster profits\u201d from switching website Energyhelpline, which hailed the US regulatory regime as tougher. The website\u2019s co-founder, Mark Todd, said the Grid was \u201cexploiting a broken regulatory system that serves them and not the British people to make billions of pounds of obscene profits\u201d. Ofgem said the regime that governs what the Grid could charge for use of its network had brought down its charges by 17% and improved customer satisfaction. \u201cComparisons between the GB and US regulatory regimes can be misleading,\u201d the regulator said. \u201cWe believe our approach is more effective at encouraging cost efficiency.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve lost count of the times I\u2019ve been asked why a US-centric company like Allied Minds has staked its future to listing on the London Stock Exchange, rather than Nasdaq or the NYSE. Why do I, as CEO of a Boston-based company which looks to commercialise the most exciting discoveries spinning out of leading American universities and government institutions shuttle across the Atlantic to tell our story to British and other European investors? What do we get out of being a FTSE250 company when we could trade on Nasdaq, the market so many regard as the natural venue for the biggest beasts of disruptive technology? For Allied Minds, the answer is that we chose London because it is largely UK investors who understand our model. Indeed the case for our London listing in June 2014 was overwhelming because our biggest shareholders, such as Woodford Investment Management and Invesco Perpetual, were already UK based. Typically, there\u2019s a very different mindset in the US where venture investors only really start to become interested after the startup is created and is well down the track to selling its products or services. By contrast, Allied Minds, and to some extent our UK-focused peers such as IP Group and Imperial Innovations, are involved in identifying the most promising opportunities at inception, at the eureka moment in the laboratory of academic and government research institutions. In our case, once we have identified a prospect, we invest and set up the business as a majority owned subsidiary company. The halo effect of this growing sector has not been lost on the London Stock Exchange as it steps up efforts to win technology IPOs in competition with global rivals. Yet the LSE has yet to showcase London\u2019s success in the IP commercialisation field which perhaps represents one of its greatest strengths in reinforcing the UK market as a world leader in disruptive technology. Given the ferocity of competition across exchanges for high growth listings, it must be wholly in the interests of the LSE to build its lead in this sector. And beyond the LSE, it falls to all of us with an interest in this London success story to do more to explain the bigger picture behind IP commercialisation. For this is a gateway to bring to market the most exciting research breakthroughs across high technology and life sciences. At Allied Minds, we single out technologies which will disrupt existing large and growing markets and business models. It\u2019s a gruelling process, sifting through thousands of prospects annually from our relationships with more than 160 top American universities, the Department of Defense and other US government agencies. This has led to the formation of several key subsidiaries capable of transforming their target markets, whether they are combating cancer or blindness, bringing the shared economy model to mobile phone spectrum, or pioneering a new form of digital memory. Any of these may have the potential to disrupt the status quo of multibillion-dollar industries. And we\u2019re making strides to move to commercialisation by partnering up with some of the biggest and most successful players in their particular sector, names such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Google, Intel and GE Ventures. To me, that\u2019s a powerful validation of the potential of this business model. And it\u2019s is a model which continues to build in the London market. At the LSE, we\u2019re seeing a virtuous circle where the faster the exchange attracts new listings in this sector, the more attractive it becomes to potential issuers. We\u2019re not the only US-based IP commercialisation company listed on the LSE. We\u2019ve been joined by PureTech Health. More will follow. Conversely, UK-based peers such as IP Group, which have hitherto concentrated on British research, are now looking to forge links with US academia and research institutes. No surprise, perhaps, when you consider the scale of the US R&amp;D spend relative to the UK. Given the breadth and depth of our relationships across US academia and federal institutions, we have no problem with competition. It\u2019s a healthy evolution of our sector. We\u2019re very happy with our London listing. Yet markets ceaselessly evolve. There are signs that knowledgeable US and Asian investors are becoming more comfortable with this investment model. The UK is a leader here. And let\u2019s hope the LSE keeps at the top of this game. You can\u2019t overestimate the importance of these disruptive technologies being readied for commercialisation. Not just for investors. But in terms of improving lives and beating diseases, for the good of society too. Chris Silva is chief executive of Allied Minds",

      "bodyText": "ITV has suffered its worst performance in the runup to Christmas in almost a decade, as advertisers become increasingly cautious about the economy. \u201cIn recent weeks the political and economic uncertainty has increased and we are currently seeing more cautious behaviour by advertisers,\u201d said the ITV chief executive, Adam Crozier. The broadcaster said TV ad revenues across the first nine months of 2016 were down by 1%. But for the final quarter they fell 7% after a drastic softening in the market as jittery advertisers held back spending after the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. The 7% decline in the final months of the year is the worst year-on-year fall ITV has reported since recording a 9% drop in the fourth quarter of 2008. The underlying performance is even worse given that ITV is now adding in revenue from UTV, the Northern Ireland ITV franchise it acquired for \u00a3100m last year, which analysts say adds 1.5% to 2%. Crozier has already announced \u00a325m in cost savings for 2017 and last month cut 120 jobs, citing the political and economic uncertainty of a potential Brexit slowdown. He now expects TV ad revenue for the full year to be down 3% but expects the group to still outperform the UK TV ad market as whole. \u201cOur strong on-screen performance and continued ability to deliver mass audiences gives us the confidence that based upon the deals we have done we will also outperform our estimate of the TV ad market in 2017,\u201d he said. Crozier said that ITV\u2019s \u00a31bn-plus programme budget will be \u00a325m lower next year as the broadcaster will not have to pay the rights cost for a major sports event; this year it aired Euro 2016 matches and in 2015 the Rugby World Cup. In a call with analysts ITV said that the combined \u00a350m in cost savings will be enough for it to offset a fall of up to 3% in TV ad revenue next year. ITV\u2019s total revenues grew 5% to \u00a32.15bn in the nine months to the end of September. Crozier said that despite the TV ad slump he expected ITV\u2019s full year earnings to remain resilient, citing the growth in its online, pay and interactive business and ITV Studios production arm. \u201cEven against the current uncertain economic backdrop we expect 2016 earnings to be broadly in line with last year,\u201d he said. \u201cITV is now a much more balanced and resilient business.\u201d Despite this claim ITV still relies on TV advertising and sponsorship for more than half its total annual \u00a33bn revenues, and 85% of revenues come from the UK market. ITV Studios, which makes shows from Coronation Street and Come Dine With Me to Victoria and Poldark, boosted its revenues by 18% to \u00a3923m in the nine months. The broadcaster said it received a \u00a333m boost from ITV Studiosn the US thanks to the drop in the value of the pound. It also admitted that the growth was driven by revenue from new acquisitions, which last year included The Voice maker Talpa Media and Poldark and Parade\u2019s End maker Mammoth. Stripping this out, ITV Studios saw revenues decline 9% on an organic basis in the first nine months. Analysts at Jefferies said this was a \u201cdisappointing\u201d performance. ITV put this down to factors including there being no series of \u00a350m global franchise Hell\u2019s Kitchen this year \u2013 two are scheduled to air in 2017 \u2013 and cancelled dramas including Texas RIsing and Best Time Ever. \u201cWe remain committed to our strategy of rebalancing and strengthening ITV and building a global content business of scale and we see clear opportunities to continue to invest for further growth across the business both organically and through acquisitions,\u201d said Crozier. Online, pay and interactive revenues rose 22% in the nine-month period. Total viewing of ITV content online, including clips from shows such as I\u2019m a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here!, rose by 22% to 746m year on year. Within this, long-form video requests for TV shows grew 49% year on year to 173m.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Adani has been shielded from potential legal challenges that loom for other miners under Queensland\u2019s water-licensing reforms after last-minute changes to legislation by the Palaszczuk government. Mining projects in development will be forced to obtain a water licence under a government bid to manage impacts on groundwater use, which its predecessor tried to deregulate. But an amendment by the government on Wednesday has exempted projects that have already been dealt with by the land court, such as Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine, from further legal challenges to a licence. However, another controversial project \u2013 the New Acland mine, which is subject to a pending land court ruling \u2013 will not be spared further challenges. This is despite a push from the Liberal National opposition for an amendment specifically exempting the mine, whose parent company is a major federal Liberal party donor. The opposition accused Labor of an embarrassing backdown on Adani and hypocrisy on New Acland with laws that would \u201ckill off close to 700 jobs\u201d. The environment minister, Steven Miles, said Labor had removed a \u201cticking time bomb [in the] reckless laws\u201d passed by the former LNP government, which were to have made unlimited groundwater freely available to miners from December. Miles said that parliament had agreed there was no benefit in courts repeating scrutiny of ground water impacts if it had already delivered a judgment after \u201cexhaustive cross-examination\u201d. Adani Australia\u2019s chief executive, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, singled out premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for thanks in providing \u201ctransitional relief for Adani\u2019s projects\u201d. \u201cThe relief is based on the company\u2019s advanced approvals status and the rigorous science-based examinations including water management that have already been undertaken,\u201d Janakaraj said. \u201cBy recognising an area of concern in this bill that might have opened up a new line of activist delays and addressing it, the premier and her government have been true to their word.\u201d He said the company was confident of beginning construction on a $21bn coal project in 2017. A Queensland Greens spokesman, Ben Pennings, said the amendment represented \u201ca midnight coup by Adani\u201d. \u201cWhile Queenslanders watched [US president-elect Donald] Trump\u2019s victory in shock, horror or celebration, the state government amended its own bill to fast-track Adani\u2019s Reef-destroying mega-mine,\u201d he said. Miles criticised the LNP for moving amendments to exempt \u201cspecific projects chosen by the LNP from having to apply for and qualify for a water licence\u201d. \u201cHow did they select those projects and what undertakings did they make to those companies?\u201d Hearings in a land court challenge by local landholders to New Acland have been completed but the member is yet to hand down a judgment. The Environmental Defenders Office, which has acted in land court challenges to both the Carmichael and New Acland mines, said the amendment that would benefit Adani was a concerning twist on what had otherwise been a \u201cgood initiative\u201d by the government. Its chief executive, Jo Bragg, said it was \u201cgravely concerning that, on the most controversial proposed coalmine in Australia, the ALP government has now moved amendments so there will be no public submissions or appeals relating to groundwater\u201d. Bragg said it was \u201ca myth\u201d that the government\u2019s legislation would cause unfair delays to miners as it continued the longstanding need for miners to gain licences \u201csubject to public appeal\u201d to use groundwater under the Water Act. \u201cAdani could have lodged its application years ago,\u201d she said. Tim Seelig, the head of the Queensland Conservation Council, said the passage of Labor\u2019s water legislation was \u201cthe best outcome possible\u201d given the difficulties of passing environmental laws through Queensland\u2019s hung parliament. The laws would enable \u201csome level of policy and legal scrutiny\u201d of water licensing processes for major mining projects, he said. \u201cWe look forward to a situation in a future parliament where new mining projects are brought back under a water licensing regime with full appeal rights. \u201cWe urge the government to use the powers it now has to properly test the ecological sustainability of advanced mining proposals, and to ensure proper scrutiny and capacity to challenge decisions where environmental destruction is proposed.\u201d",

Interest from would-be buyers rose for the second month in a row, with a balance of 10% of Rics members reporting more demand. The survey showed a small fall in new instructions in October. The combination of growing demand and falling supply pushed up house prices further, with 23% more surveyors reporting growth than a decline, up from a net balance of 18% in September. London remained an exception where prices fell for the eighth month, with 16% more surveyors reporting falling rather than rising prices. This reflected affordability issues and the slump in luxury home sales in inner London owing to Brexit uncertainty and stamp duty changes, while the outer boroughs were still seeing significant price growth, Rics said. Land Registry data has also suggested that the wealthiest buyers are shunning London, with sales of \u00a310m-plus homes collapsing 86% in the past year. Simon Rubinsohn, the Rics chief economist, said: \u201cThe dire shortage of available housing across the UK is continuing to push prices upwards, regardless of the uncertainty linked to the ongoing discussions surrounding Brexit. We are only weeks away from the autumn statement and it will be interesting to see what measures \u2013 if any - the chancellor will put in place to increase housing supply and create a more affordable market.\u201d As the market recovers after the shock vote to leave the EU in June, agreed sales rose slightly last month, with a balance of 5% of surveyors seeing an increase. All regions of the country are expected to experience a further rise in property transactions in coming months. Prices are also expected to keep rising, with 18% more surveyors predicting growth in the next three months rather than a decline. Central London is the only exception where prices are forecast to be broadly flat in the near future. The lack of homes to buy has fuelled demand in the lettings market, where a balance of 29% of surveyors reported a rise. London bucked this trend, with a balance of 15% reporting falling demand. This means rents are likely to fall in the next three months in the capital, in marked contrast with the rest of the country where rental growth expectations picked up, to 34% from 15% in the three months to June. The booming rental market could outstrip house buying for the first time since the 1930s next year, the UK\u2019s biggest estate agency chain Countrywide has predicted.",
