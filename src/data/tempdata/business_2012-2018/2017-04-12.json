      "bodyText": "The average number of homes for sale by each estate agent has fallen to a record low, with agents in parts of the country gloomier than at any time since the financial crash, according to a report by the surveyors\u2019 professional body. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said the number of properties sitting on estate agents\u2019 books fell to just 43 per branch in March, the lowest figure since the body started collecting the data in 1978. House prices were broadly flat across the UK during March, said Rics, rising strongly in north-west England, but declining in London. Rics said sentiment in central London has progressively deteriorated, with a net balance of 49% of surveyors reporting price falls, the weakest since 2009 when the UK was still in the grip of recession. A net balance of 13% of surveyors saw a decrease rather than an increase in fresh properties coming on to the market. But while there are fewer properties available for sale, they are not being snapped up by eager buyers. Rics said an overall balance of 3% more surveyors saw a fall in agreed sales rather than an uplift last month. The decline in activity is in part caused by buy-to-let landlords deserting the market ahead of new taxes that began on 6 April. In separate data, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said buy-to-let lending plummeted by 44% in February compared with a year earlier. But the absence of landlord buyers appears to be leaving the market more open to first-time buyers, who took out 11% more house purchase loans than a year ago, said the CML. Surveyors are forecasting a mild recovery in activity over the coming 12 months, with a net balance of 24% saying that house sales numbers will increase, although that is weaker than expectations in Rics\u2019s report last month. The Rics data is the latest sign of a slowdown in the property market. UK house prices fell for the first time in almost two years in March, according to Nationwide, with the average price dropping to \u00a3207,308 following a 0.6% rise in prices in February. It was the first fall on the Nationwide index since June 2015. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics, said: \u201cThe latest results for the Rics survey show little change in the underlying picture surrounding both sales and markets. \u201cHigh-end sale properties in central London remain under pressure, while the wider residential market continues to be underpinned by a lack of stock. \u201cFor the time being it is hard to see any major impetus for change in the market, something also being reflected in the flat trend in transaction levels.\u201d While the number of homes for sale is at record lows, the number of tenants registering to rent a property is rising. Rics said that surveyors saw a rise in tenant demand in March, although the pace of growth slackened from the month before. The number of new properties available to rent also fell, for the sixth straight month. \u201cThe imbalance between supply and demand continues to drive rents upwards. Contributors anticipate further growth in rents in virtually all areas over the next 12 months with the exception of the capital, where rents are anticipated to continue to decline over the near term,\u201d said Rics.",

      "bodyText": "The release of the taxation statistics for 2014-15 reveals that, while the number of people negative gearing has levelled in the past three years as interest rates have fallen, the greatest share of the benefits of negative gearing goes to above average earners \u2013 and the biggest growth is to those owning multiple properties. With housing affordability and negative gearing the hot topic in the run up to the May budget, the annual release of the taxation statistics by the ATO on Wednesday served to reinforce how greatly negative gearing figures in people\u2019s tax affairs. In 2014-15, 1.27 million people recorded a rental net loss. This was down slightly from the 1.3 million in the years before and meant that 12.8% of taxpayers were negative gearing. Again that was down from the previous year and the peak of 2012-13 when 13.4% of taxpayers were recording a rental loss: The reason for the drop is mostly because the main way to achieve a loss on your rental investment is through payments on the interest of the mortgage. But, as interest rates fall, that cost also falls, which means it is actually harder to record a loss. Over the past four years, the number of people claiming a deduction for payments of interest on a rental property have increased but the total amount claimed has fallen: This is then reflected in the amount of rental loss claimed each year. In 2014-15, the net result from rentals was a loss of $3.6bn \u2013 well down on the $8.4bn total loss in 2011-12: That means that the government has in effect not had to lose as much taxation revenue due to negative gearing as in the past. But it is also a warning. The number of people claiming income through rents has remained around the same level over the past few years but the cost to the government through negative gearing has declined because of falling interest rates. But when those interest rates again climb (as they have for investment properties this year), so too will the rental \u201closses\u201d and so too will the cost to the government. Now is the perfect time for the government to move on negative gearing \u2013 because now is when the revenue forgone is at its lowest. The veritable dump truck of data released by the ATO also allows us to look at who is negative gearing. Analysis by the Grattan Institute\u2019s John Daley reveals that while Scott Morrison might like to talk up the fact that nurses and teachers negative gear, in reality the people who are most likely to be indulging in the practice, and who also receive the greatest benefit, are those from much higher income earning professions. The Grattan Institute found that 12% of teachers negative gear \u2013 just below the average for all taxpayers \u2013 and a mere 9% of nurses do. By contrast, surgeons and anaesthetists \u2013 the two professions with the highest average income \u2013 absolutely love to negative gear. Twenty-nine per cent of both occupations negative gear and they also achieve a much higher average tax benefit \u2013 over $3,000 compared to nurses benefitting by just $226 and teachers by $289: The data also allows us to break down negative gearers by income tax brackets. In 2014-15, 40.1% of individuals earned less than $37,000, they accounted for 24% of all people negative gearing, but only 19% of the total amount of taxable income loss. By contrast, those earning between $80,000 and $180,000 accounted for 19% of individuals but 32% of negative gearers, and 34% of the amount of rental loss. But the big disparity is for those earning over $180,000. Only 3.4% of individuals earned that much but they accounted for 8% of all negative gearers and 15% of the total rental loss amount: It reinforces that, while negative gearing might be done by people across the income spectrum, it is much more likely to be done by those on higher incomes and overwhelmingly they get the biggest share of the dollar benefit. The data also showed that while, overwhelmingly, most landlords own only one property, the biggest growth has been among those who own more than five properties. While 71% of those earning income from rents own just one property, since 2012-13 there has been a 9.2% increase in the number of landlords who own five or more properties: The data suggests that one obvious way to limit negative gearing is to put a cap on the number of properties able to be used for the purpose \u2013 it would not hit the average income earners, nor even the vast majority of those who negative gear. While it appears given the recent pronouncements of Malcolm Turnbull and Morrison that negative gearing will not be touched in the May budget, the latest taxation statistics show yet again that it is a tax minimisation scheme that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy. And yet because of low interest rates the cost to the budget is at a low point \u2013 as interest rates inevitably rise, so too will the cost to the budget from revenue lost. The time to move is now. Failure to do so will cost the government much more in the future and it will also be much harder to move should the practice become even more prevalent.",

      "bodyText": "Pepsi has dominated the headlines over the past week for having the country\u2019s most irritating and offensive TV advertisement, but Burger King briefly took the mantle on Wednesday with an ad that includes a command to wake up voice-activated Google Home devices. The 15-second ad features a man in a Burger King uniform leaning into the camera to say: \u201cOK Google, what is the Whopper burger?\u201d People with the Google Home assistant and Android phones with voice search enabled within listening range of their TV discovered that the command triggered devices to read aloud the Wikipedia entry for Burger King\u2019s flagship burger. The intrusion was short-lived. Google Home devices stopped responding to the prompt spoken in the commercial a few hours after it launched. The devices will still respond if someone else (eg the real owner of the smart assistant) asks the same question. It is likely that Google updated the Home software to ensure it didn\u2019t respond to the specific Burger King sound clip. Google did not respond to a request to confirm this. \u201cWe saw it as a technology to essentially punch through that fourth wall,\u201d Burger King\u2019s president, Jos\u00e9 Cil, had earlier told BuzzFeed News, adding that it is a \u201ccool way to connect directly with our guests\u201d. The reaction to the campaign calls into question just how \u201ccool\u201d this advertising technique is. Many viewers have complained that it is intrusive, unnecessary, gimmicky and possibly only designed to elicit an irritated response. Is there even any value \u2013 beyond provocation \u2013 in a home device reading out a description of the Whopper? Some experts argue there\u2019s still value in such a provocation. \u201cAny advertising or media idea which provokes us to think about the absurdities of modern day digital life is, in itself, a good thing,\u201d said Charlie Crowe, the president of C Squared, a publishing and events company focused on media and marketing. \u201cPerhaps what is so unnerving about this is that it makes us think about how digital technology is impacting our lives in ways we are only beginning to appreciate. Maybe this all is a little uncomfortable... so why shouldn\u2019t this make us want to leave our homes and visit a Burger King with our friends?\u201d It\u2019s unlikely there will be a flood of annoying ads like this partly because of the swift consumer backlash but also because both Amazon and Google are exploring introducing specific voice recognition to their services.

      "bodyText": "In defence of large companies named and shamed by Corbyn (Corbyn declares war on M&amp;S \u2013 but retailer \u2018does not recognise figures\u2019, 12 April), Experian said that the data taken from its report showing very late payment of invoices do not apply to the majority of invoices. Capita said that only 10% of its payments are made later than 30 days of receipt. But even such a small percentage of late payment by a large company can cause huge pressures down the supply chain, and it invites questions about corporate ethics. Jeremy Corbyn raises a valid alarm about a potential national scandal. SP Chakravarty Bangor, Gwynedd \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn is right to \u201cdeclare war\u201d on late-paying companies. Data on the scale of the problem comes as no surprise. My late father worked into his 80s doing bookkeeping for a small engineering firm. They did minor maintenance on ships. Every time I spoke to my father about work, he seemed to be chasing up overdue payments (cheques in those days) from major shipping companies. On some occasions, his boss had to pay his employees out of his personal bank account. Nothing has changed. That\u2019s what big companies do. That\u2019s why they\u2019re big and why small businesses struggle or go to the wall. Karen Barratt Winchester \u2022 The claim by M&amp;S to \u201cnot recognise\u201d Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s figures in his accusations of late payments to suppliers is pathetic. The company protests that its average time from being invoiced to payment is 54 days, despite that already being almost double the standard one-month term. And obviously if that is the average, it means there are payments that take considerably more than 54 days, as Labour highlights. Norman Miller Brighton, East Sussex \u2022 Your editorial on productivity (Brexit makes solving the productivity puzzle a priority, 10 April) raises an important point about low productivity, but is disingenuous about causes. Those of us with children of average ability struggling to find decent employment in the labour market see daily the impact of a seemingly unlimited supply of qualified and hard-working immigrant labour which is exploited by the inefficient and incompetent management that characterises much of British business. Hire and fire is the norm, combined with awful working environments and marginal pay. Work benefits are history for most, sickness is penalised and opportunity non-existent. The underlying problem is that UK society has no understanding of professional management, just as it belittles manufacturing and most forms of commercial endeavour outside the professions. Productivity will not improve until wealth creators get the respect they deserve and this has to come through cultural change and education. The state can do two things. First, to only procure from companies with accredited management development; and second, to provide the infrastructure and fiscal incentives to remove any excuses for not developing this capability. It is up to opinion formers (like this newspaper) to overcome their distaste for \u201ctrade\u201d and champion professional management and the state resources needed to achieve and sustain it. Paul Wood Southampton \u2022 By all means worry about low productivity, the lack of a living wage and poor working conditions, but don\u2019t forget the elephant in the room: bosses are simply taking advantage of a ready supply of cheap migrant labour. Rather than pin our hopes on a difficult-to-police, statutory living wage, simply pursue an even-handed immigration policy that is not biased against Britain\u2019s unskilled citizenry. The market will increase unskilled pay. A reduction in the import of cheap labour will result in the transfer of purchasing power from the majority haves to the minority have-nots, as the many menial jobs that cannot be outsourced abroad become more costly. Not to do so is to say goodbye to a living wage. Yugo Kovach Winterborne Houghton, Dorset \u2022 A key factor in the UK\u2019s awful productivity record is that far too much time and energy goes into devising elaborate schemes for generating funny money rather than putting in the effort needed to invest for the long term in actual wealth creation. For over a century the UK has shown a distinct preference for finance over industrial capital, a situation made even worse over the last 40 years since the deregulation of the City. This will not change until the rules are changed to make it more profitable to invest in the production of real goods and services than in the high-class gambling that is par for the course in the City. Given the Tories\u2019 reliance on City money it\u2019s doubtful that meaningful change will come from that quarter.

EDF announced on Wednesday that customers on its dual fuel standard tariff \u2013 for accounts taking both electricity and gas \u2013 would pay 7.2% or \u00a378 more a year from June. It follows an increase of 1.2% in March and will bring the average annual household bill under EDF to \u00a31,160. The move by the energy group, which is 85% French state owned, adds to the pressure on the prime minister to take action after she warned in March that the market was \u201cmanifestly not working for all consumers\u201d. Alex Neill, director of home products and services at Which?, said: \u201cMillions are continuing to suffer due to a lack of competition in the energy market. If energy companies fail to properly engage with their customers to help them find better deals, then the government and the regulator must step in.\u201d Ofgem, the industry regulator, said the rise was \u201cdifficult to justify\u201d. A government spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s another sign the market isn\u2019t working, and we will shortly set out proposals to help energy consumers as part of the government\u2019s Plan for Britain.\u201d The government\u2019s plans are expected to be published later this month. EDF blamed the increase on rising wholesale energy costs and government policies that have to be paid for by consumer bills, which include schemes to alleviate fuel poverty and support low carbon power. Of the big six energy companies \u2013 EDF, British Gas, E.ON, npower, ScottishPower and SSE \u2013 five have raised their prices in recent months, with only British Gas promising to freeze them until August. The increases have fuelled calls for a price cap to help struggling bill payers, which has prompted warnings from energy bosses that such a move would hurt competition and consumers. The prime minister recently put suppliers on notice when she said she was planning to take action, though what form that will take is not yet clear. \u201cEnergy is not a luxury,\u201d she told the Conservative spring conference in March. \u201cIt is a necessity of life. But it is clear to me \u2013 and to anyone who looks at it \u2013 that the market is not working as it should.\u201d Vincent de Rivaz, EDF\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cI know that price rises are never welcome, but the industry is facing significant cost increases.\u201d On the prospect of imminent government intervention, he added: \u201cWe accept that the government, regulators and consumer groups have concerns about the way markets work for customers, particularly the energy market.\u201d Last month De Rivaz told an industry conference that he understood why May was considering stepping in. He said: \u201cDon\u2019t let the industry off the hook when it comes to delivering the long-term objective of a better market for all customers.\u201d Price comparison sites showed that EDF\u2019s standard tariff was now more than \u00a3300 higher than the cheapest deal on the market, and had become one of the more expensive standard tariffs on offer. Customers on cheaper fixed deals are often stung when those contracts come to an end, because they default on to more expensive standard tariffs. Mark Todd, co-founder of the switching site energyhelpline, said: \u201cThis second price rise from EDF is a total shock. If you are impacted you must switch to avoid this price rise.\u201d However, figures released on Wednesday showed the number of people switching to different suppliers is increasing only slowly, with 536,658 customers changing supplier in March compared with 420,014 a year earlier. MPs said EDF\u2019s move showed why the government needed to intervene. \u201cThe energy market is manifestly not working and the government needs to step in to protect the vast majority of consumers who find themselves on these standard tariffs,\u201d said Conservative MP John Penrose, who has been lobbying for a relative price cap, whereby the most expensive deals are capped in relation to the cheapest ones. EDF claimed it was softening the impact on customers by deferring the rise until the summer, when people use less energy. The company also said wholesale prices were a third higher than a year ago. But this drew a sharp response from the industry watchdog, Ofgem, which said it had not seen a dramatic rise in wholesale prices since EDF\u2019s last increase. Dermot Nolan, the regulator\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOfgem and the government are working on a raft of reforms to ensure fairer treatment for consumers and to make the market smarter and more competitive. Today\u2019s announcement is further evidence of the need for change.\u201d Nolan told MPs in February that Ofgem had the power to impose a price cap on tariffs but only if directed to do so by the government. Many analysts believe some sort of regulatory intervention by May\u2019s government is now highly likely, with experts at Barclays saying it was \u201calmost inevitable\u201d. The main impact of a price cap would be to significantly dent the profit margin that suppliers make on each customer. Last year the competition watchdog ended a lengthy inquiry into the industry by pulling back from plans for a temporary cap on bills, opting instead for measures to help customers switch to cheaper deals.",

According to industry watchdogs, British supermarkets have responded to Brexit-induced inflation and the weaker pound by quietly hiking the cost of less regular purchases such as light bulbs, water filters and dental floss. According to the Office of National Statistics, food prices rose in annual terms for the first time in almost three years. Comparison website MySupermarket.co.uk compiled data from Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose, Ocado and Morrisons and found that, while milk stood still at \u00a31 for four pints everywhere, the cost of an exotic fish supper has increased markedly since last October. \u201cThe items that are going up in price are more likely to be luxury items such as fancy fish, decorative candles, or eclairs and doughnuts,\u201d says Aisling Lawless of MySupermarket.com. \u201cCustomers are less likely to notice those increases, because they don\u2019t buy those things very frequently. But you\u2019re going to notice if your milk is more expensive. You might even go to another supermarket to see if their milk is cheaper, and the retailer could lose a customer. The supermarkets push up prices on non-essentials to avoid raising the prices of essential items.\u201d Competition between the chains is keeping a lid on the cost of weekly staples, says Lawless, but as Brexit really begins to bite, that could become unsustainable. Almost half the food in UK supermarkets comes from overseas. \u201cWe hope that British-produced products such as milk will stay around the same price. But consumers should pay attention to price increases on anything coming from outside the UK.\u201d That doesn\u2019t just mean rolling tobacco \u2013 which increased in price by almost 38% between October and March \u2013 or smoked kippers, up by 7.3% in the same period. It also means common fresh fruit and vegetables, such as bananas, which went up in price by around 12% between January and February alone. Poor growing conditions, such as those in southern Europe which resulted in a shortage of iceberg lettuce in January and February, are also a factor.

The bank has also extended another $950m to a venture in which Trump owns a 30% stake, the Wall Street Journal <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-debts-are-widely-held-on-wall-street-creating-new-potential-conflicts-1483637414\">reported</a> in January.</p> <p>Van Hollen, who sits on the Senate banking committee, said he had \u201cgreat concern\u201d about possible conflicts of interest between Deutsche and Trump and questions about whether the bank\u2019s role as the president\u2019s largest creditor could influence multiple ongoing investigations into the German bank.</p> <p>In a letter to Bill Woodley, the CEO of Deutsche Bank America, the senator wrote: \u201cI am asking that you do not use your institution\u2019s ties to President Trump as leverage in any of these ongoing cases or ongoing regulatory oversight.</p> <p>\u201cFurther, I ask that Deutsche Bank and its executives do not take any actions to assist Mr Trump in circumventing any of his ethical obligations to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201d<br></p> <p>Deutsche Bank says its position is that it will not comment or guide on any stories about Trump\u2019s financial affairs.</p> <p>The letter,<strong> </strong>sent on Wednesday and obtained by the Guardian, comes as Deutsche Bank faces ongoing investigations by the Department of Justice into alleged money laundering involving Russia. It is also in settlement talks with federal officials over its alleged role in the mortgage crisis. </p> <p>Van Hollen and another prominent Democrat, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, have raised concerns about whether Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, could oversee an impartial investigation given the bank\u2019s close ties to the White House. Van Hollen said Sessions had not responded to an earlier letter about his oversight of the Deutsche probes at the DoJ, but Van Hollen\u2019s position on the banking committee means the German bank could feel compelled to reply. </p> <p>In recent months Deutsche Bank\u2019s alleged links with Russia have come under intense scrutiny.

      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s biggest bank is coming under pressure from a US senator to give further details of its lending to Donald Trump and meetings it has had with the administration. Chris Van Hollen has written to Deutsche Bank asking for assurances that it will not use the president\u2019s outstanding multimillion-dollar loans as \u201cleverage\u201d. The Democratic senator is also demanding to know whether the bank has restructured Trump\u2019s debt or sold it to \u201cforeign entities\u201d. Trump currently has two loans and two mortgages with Deutsche Bank and owes it about $340m (\u00a3270m). The bank has also extended another $950m to a venture in which Trump owns a 30% stake, the Wall Street Journal reported in January. Van Hollen, who sits on the Senate banking committee, said he had \u201cgreat concern\u201d about possible conflicts of interest between Deutsche and Trump and questions about whether the bank\u2019s role as the president\u2019s largest creditor could influence multiple ongoing investigations into the German bank. In a letter to Bill Woodley, the CEO of Deutsche Bank America, the senator wrote: \u201cI am asking that you do not use your institution\u2019s ties to President Trump as leverage in any of these ongoing cases or ongoing regulatory oversight. \u201cFurther, I ask that Deutsche Bank and its executives do not take any actions to assist Mr Trump in circumventing any of his ethical obligations to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201d Deutsche Bank says its position is that it will not comment or guide on any stories about Trump\u2019s financial affairs. The letter, sent on Wednesday and obtained by the Guardian, comes as Deutsche Bank faces ongoing investigations by the Department of Justice into alleged money laundering involving Russia. It is also in settlement talks with federal officials over its alleged role in the mortgage crisis. Van Hollen and another prominent Democrat, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, have raised concerns about whether Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, could oversee an impartial investigation given the bank\u2019s close ties to the White House. Van Hollen said Sessions had not responded to an earlier letter about his oversight of the Deutsche probes at the DoJ, but Van Hollen\u2019s position on the banking committee means the German bank could feel compelled to reply. In recent months Deutsche Bank\u2019s alleged links with Russia have come under intense scrutiny. The FBI, meanwhile, has announced that it is investigating possible collusion in the run-up to the US election between officials from the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. In January the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) fined the bank $425m for failing to prevent $10bn of Russian money laundering. The \u201cmirror trades\u201d scheme was run out of its Moscow office. The UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority imposed a \u00a3163m fine \u2013 its biggest ever \u2013 for the same offence. The previous month Deutsche paid $7.2bn to settle a decade-old toxic bond mis-selling scandal with the US Department of Justice. In March it emerged Deutsche played a prominent role in a second Russian money-laundering scandal. It was one of dozens of western financial institutions that processed at least $20bn \u2013 and possibly more \u2013 of criminal Russian cash. The scheme, \u201cthe Global Laundromat\u201d, ran from 2010 to 2014. The Guardian revealed in February that some of Trump\u2019s immediate family members were clients of Deutsche, including the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka, her husband, Jared Kushner, and Kushner\u2019s mother, Seryl Stadtmauer. In his letter Van Hollen said Kushner, the president\u2019s trusted senior advisor, had a multimillion-dollar line of credit with the bank. Deutsche has provided $370m in financing for a Kushner Companies\u2019 property in Time Square.

      "bodyText": "Tesco has reported its first year of sales growth in the UK since 2010, but good news for its vast domestic chain has been overshadowed by the stormy outlook for future trading as the weakness of sterling pushes up food prices. The UK\u2019s largest retailer was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 on Wednesday, with the shares finishing down more than 5%, despite beating City expectations with a 30% rise in group operating profit to \u00a31.28bn in the year to the end of February. Within that figure, the UK business saw profit surge 60% to \u00a3803m. \u201cWe don\u2019t welcome inflation and, when we do see it, we have conversations with our supplier base to mitigate it as much as we can,\u201d said the chief executive, Dave Lewis, who was parachuted in to lead a turnaround of the supermarket giant in September 2014. Lewis said Tesco\u2019s grocery prices had fallen 1.8% over the past year despite inflation of 0.6% creeping in in the fourth quarter. Lewis added that a typical Tesco basket of goods cost 6% less than when he took over \u2013 although the equivalent figure was 7% a year ago. Last year Tesco removed Marmite and other household brands made by Unilever from Tesco\u2019s website after the manufacturer tried to raise its prices by about 10% owing to sterling\u2019s slump after the Brexit vote. Lewis said the retailer was passing less of the financial pain on to its customers than its major competitors were. After two years of falling grocery prices, supermarket chiefs are pushing them up \u2013 but some analysts fear this will play into the hands of discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which thrived during the last recession. \u201cWe do expect the discounters to get a second wind, but not the hurricane they got last time,\u201d said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. Despite controlling almost 28% of the UK grocery market, Tesco has been losing customers to Aldi and Lidl for most of this decade. But the retailer has now managed its first full year of growth since the 2009-10 financial year, with like-for-like sales up 0.9% thanks to a focus on lower prices and better customer service. Its international arm fared less well, however, with operating profit tumbling 12.5% to \u00a3320m, due in part to a price war in Poland. Black suggested the severe share price fall was more to do with \u201cfast money being disappointed and buggering off somewhere else\u201d after taking a gamble on Tesco in the wake of its proposed \u00a33.7bn takeover of Booker, the cash-and-carry group behind the Londis and Budgens chains. Last month Schroders and Artisan Partners, which between them own 9% of Tesco, revealed they had both written to Tesco\u2019s chairman, John Allan, to ask him to pull out of the deal. But Lewis insisted that overall investors had been \u201cpositive\u201d about the takeover. \u201cThe shareholder base of Tesco is very broad and not all shareholders have the same motivation so charting the course perfectly ... is really hard,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis [Booker deal] is a big, exciting and compelling opportunity.\u201d Lewis took charge of Tesco after a string of profit warnings under his predecessor, Philip Clarke. But the subsequent discovery of accounting irregularities forced him to embark on a major restructuring of the business, including the disposal of its South Korean chain, Homeplus, for \u00a34bn. The shakeup culminated in a \u00a36.4bn loss two years ago \u2013 one of the biggest losses in British corporate history \u2013 after the group slashed the book value of its property and stock. Five years ago Tesco was banking annual profits of \u00a34bn and in a bid to reclaim that high ground Lewis has set a target that by 2020 Tesco will earn between 3.5p and 4p of operating profit for every \u00a31 customers spend. The group currently makes 2.3p in the pound. Lewis insists it is possible to pull off the Booker deal \u2013 which is expected to force a lengthy competition probe \u2013 while hitting those targets at the same time. \u201cWe are completely and utterly committed to delivering the targets we have set for ourselves,\u201d said Lewis, who added that the plan, which involves slashing \u00a31.5bn from its operating costs, was running ahead of schedule. \u201cBut on top of that, Booker represents a new growth opportunity, and it sets us up for many years ahead. My job is not just to be managing the short term.\u201d Tesco is now close to drawing a line under the accounting scandal. It has agreed to pay a fine of \u00a3129m to settle the Serious Fraud Office investigation and has also struck an \u00a385m deal with the Financial Conduct Authority to compensate affected shareholders. The cost of these deals pulled pre-tax profits down by nearly 40% to just \u00a3145m.",

It was the first time since August 2014 that inflation has outpaced wage growth and signalling that a Brexit-related squeeze in UK living standards is underway (the fall in the value of the pound since the vote is pushing up inflation). Over the broader three-month period to the end of February, regular pay growth slipped to 2.2% from 2.4% in the three months to January. Pay growth including bonuses was unchanged at 2.3%. Unemployment remained at a 42-year low of 4.7%, and the employment rate also stayed at the highest level since records began in 1971, at 74.6%. Tesco reported that profits have once again broken through \u00a31bn, after annual sales grew at its UK chain for the first time in seven years. Shares are down more than 5% however, making it the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest faller. Sports Direct named Alex Balacki, a store manager in Barnstaple, as its first employee representative to attend board meetings, as the retailer attempts to clean-up its reputation. Over in Brussels, the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde warned Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist stance could result in a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d for the global economy. European markets were subdued. The FTSE 100 is currently down 10 points at 7,356. The pound is up 0.06% against the dollar at $1.2495. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Athens, Christine Lagarde\u2019s comments have caused much ado, with some officials regarding the IMF chief\u2019s insistence on debt relief \u201c a big plus\u201d in ongoing negotiations with creditors. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led government has from the outset set debt relief as a goal, saying it must be part of an all-conclusive package that will ultimately define Greece\u2019s post-bailout future. The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos will make the case when he holds talks with Christine Lagarde and the US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin at the Fund\u2019s spring meetings in Washington next week. Tskalotos says he is confident of a solution \u201cwell before the summer.\u201d But Lagarde\u2019s insistence that a lot still remains to be done also reflects mounting concerns that differences between Athens and creditors are far from being resolved. International auditors representing lender keeping the debt-stricken country afloat were meant to have resumed inspections in the Greek capital this week. Fears are rising that despite a \u201cpreliminary deal\u201d thrashed out with euro group finance ministers last week, time is fast running out to complete the compliance review at the heart of Athens latest standoff with lenders in time in time for the euro group\u2019s next meeting in May. Let\u2019s take a look at the markets. The FTSE 100\u2019s earlier gains have been erased and the index is now down 9 points or 0.1% at 7,357. Here is how markets are doing elsewhere in Europe: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.03% at 12,143 France\u2019s CAC: +0.2% at 5,110 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 20,016 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 10,383 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 382 Back in the UK, the inaugural international FinTech conference has been taking place in London. The sector - which includes things like contactless payments, banking apps and online crowd funding - employs more than 60,000 people in the UK and is worth nearly \u00a37 billion to the UK economy according to the Treasury. The government is hopeful that Britain will remain a frontrunner in FinTech after it has left the EU. However, the chancellor Philip Hammond warned delegates that it won\u2019t come easy: We can\u2019t remain the number one place for FinTech and the other technologies of the fourth industrial revolution by simply relying on our ingenuity, talent and openness, we have to go out and get the business. We will have to strive and graft and fight to seize the opportunities - and make the most of them. That means growing and strengthening the areas \u2013 like Fintech \u2013 in which we enjoy a competitive advantage\u2026 while we need to continue to attract the brightest and the best from around the world to these shores. We must also do better at nurturing and developing the home-grown talent to drive our economy forward in the future. Our vision of an outward-looking, Global Britain will deliver the high-skilled, high-wage economy of the future that will power the higher living standards we all want to see for future generations. Lagarde has also commented on Greece, saying the Greek government was heading in the right direction on reforms but talks on the bailout and the IMF\u2019s potential bailout were \u201conly halfway through\u201d. She said the Washington-based Fund was still considering whether to join the Greek bailout, adding \u201cwe are not there yet\u201d. Christine Lagarde has used a speech in Brussels to criticise Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist stance. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund said that putting up trade barriers would amount to a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d for the global economy. More recently, we worked together to ensure that the great recession did not become another Great Depression. Cooperation through a multilateral framework has benefited every country. Fostering more resilient growth therefore requires more international cooperation \u2013 not less. Restricting trade would be a self-inflicted wound that disrupts supply chains, hurts global output, and inflates the prices of production materials and consumer goods. And low-income households are hurt the most as they consume the largest part of their incomes. Read the full story here: The graphic below shows how inflation outpaced regular pay growth (excluding bonuses) in February: Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, has called on the Prime Minister to \u201cact urgently\u201d to avoid a new living standards crisis. She said: Pay packets are taking a hammering from rising inflation and falling wage growth. We now need urgent action to stop another living standards crisis. Working people will want to know when Theresa May is going to do something to help. We need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better paid jobs. And it\u2019s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting midwives, teachers and other public servants. John Philpott, labour market expert and director of the Jobs Economist, says Britain\u2019s unemployment rate could fall further. A joint record employment rate of 74.6%, an unemployment rate at a 42-year low of 4.7% and almost zero (0.1%) growth in real average weekly earnings illustrates a remarkable structural change in the operation of the UK labour market compared with earlier decades. This particular combination of jobs and pay suggests that the unemployment rate could fall much further, perhaps below 4%, without triggering troublesome pay inflation. While the effect of Brexit uncertainty on the demand side of the economy might yet result in a temporary rise in unemployment later this year, full employment is now a more realistic prospect for the UK than at any time since the early 1970s. Business lobby group the CBI has responded to the jobs and wages data. Rachel Smith, principal labour market economist, says: It\u2019s good to see more people in work, and with the level of vacancies the highest on record, access to the right skills remains a key challenge. With inflation rising, real pay growth has fallen back for the third month in a row now. This remains a concern, so it\u2019s vital that productivity increases if we are to see earnings head up. Developing a modern industrial strategy, making the most of a skilled workforce that delivers across the UK, will be key to helping firms give productivity a meaningful boost. Here is a summary of the main points in the ONS report on the labour market: Regular pay excluding bonuses grew by 2.2% in the three months to February 2017, compared with the three months to February 2016. This was lower than the 2.4% growth in the three months to January. Total pay including bonuses grew by 2.3% over the same period, unchanged from the previous three months. Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remained at 4.7%. The jobless rate was last lower in June to August 1975. The number of unemployed people in Britain fell by 45,000 to 1.56m. There were 31.84 million people in work in the three months to February, 39,000 more than for September to November 2016. Britain\u2019s employment rate was 74.6%, the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. The Resolution Foundation has analysed the ONS figures and says real pay is falling in sectors representing 40% of the workforce. Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the thinktank, says: Britain\u2019s brief pay recovery has come to an end. Forty per cent of the workforce are experiencing shrinking pay packets according to the latest figures, in sectors ranging from accommodation to finance and the public sector. Many more will join them in the coming months as inflation continues to rise, with pay across the economy as a whole set to have fallen in the first three months of 2017. While the National Living Wage is protecting the lowest earners from this squeeze, boosting wages across the rest of the economy is the big living standards challenge of this parliament. Taking the month of February alone (the ONS prefers to use a three-month rolling average), regular pay growth excluding bonuses was just 1.9%, well below the 2.3% inflation rate. It was a different for those receiving a bonus however. Average total pay including bonuses increasing by 2.9%, significantly outpacing inflation. The bonus season tends to run from December to April according to the ONS. The last time regular pay growth (over three months) was weaker than headline inflation was two and a half years ago, in June-August of 2014. At that point wages were growing by just 0.9% while inflation was 1.5%. The latest figures suggest the Brexit vote in June is now starting to weigh on UK living standards. The sharp fall in the value of the pound since the referendum has made goods imported from abroad more expensive. That has started to be felt in higher shop prices, pushing inflation up. Meanwhile wage growth is weakening. With inflation expected to rise to 3% by summer (from 2.3% now), and no sign of a meaningful pick up in wage growth, household finances are likely to come under increasing strain. Figures just out confirm the squeeze in living standards is on. Regular pay growth (which excludes bonuses), grew by 2.2% in the three months to February. That was lower than the 2.3% rate of inflation in February, signalling a return to falling real pay. Pay including bonuses was 2.3% over the three months according to the ONS data. Meanwhile the unemployment rate held steady at 4.7%. More soon. Unite has warned that Alex Balacki - the first worker representative elected to attend Sports Direct board meetings - faces an \u201cuphill struggle\u201d to bring fairness to the retailer\u2019s boardroom. The union says it will be a challenge to make workers\u2019 concerns heard and to resolve the deep-rooted problems across the business. Unite wants to see agency workers moved onto permanent contracts without delay and has invited Balacki to a meeting. Luke Primarolo, who is leading the Sports Direct campaign for Unite said: Unite wishes the newest member of the Sports Direct board well and would like to offer to meet as soon as possible so that we can brief him on the experiences of the workforce. We urge that he makes one of his first acts to persuade the company that agency workers on insecure hire-and-fire contracts are offered permanent appointments. We sincerely hope that the new board member will take up our invitation to meet. As a company appointee he faces an uphill struggle to convince the workforce that he will be their eyes and ears in the boardroom. Tesco\u2019s stock market fortunes have rapidly reversed this morning. It has switched from being the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest riser to its biggest faller. The supermarket chain is down 3.1% at 189.5p. Earlier it was providing a boost to the rest of the sector, but it is now taking down Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons: Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says that while investors are currently focusing on the UK jobs and wages report due at 9.30am, attention is likely to shift to the US: The UK jobs report does have a challenger for market dominance this Wednesday: Trump. The President is set to conduct an interview on the Fox Business Network, one that promises to cover everything from healthcare and tax reform to his actions in Syria and the increasingly fractious relationships with Russia and North Korea. All of this is catnip for investors, and may end up overshadowing the reaction to that British jobs data. Traders across Europe are in a positive mood so far this morning. Tesco is leading the FTSE 100 higher, with the index up 36 points or 0.5% at 7,401. All major European markets are up: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 12,200 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 5,129 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 20,278 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,455 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 383 Sports Direct has named the first worker representative to attend its board meetings as the retailer attempts to address widespread criticism over its treatment of staff and poor record on corporate governance. Alex Balacki was the successfully elected candidate, and will attend all scheduled meetings of the board over the next 12 months, before a new representative is elected. Balacki, 30, works for Sports Direct as a store manager in Barnstaple and started at the company 13 years ago as a casual sales assistant on Saturdays. He said: I\u2019m very proud to be chosen by my fellow members of staff to fulfil this important responsibility. I\u2019d like to thank everybody who took part in the elections, including all of the other candidates. It\u2019s now my role to ensure the people of Sports Direct are heard. Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, said: I\u2019d like to be the first to congratulate Alex, who will help us to continue to make a positive difference by ensuring that your voice is heard in the boardroom. I have said many times that this is a company that was built by the great people who work here. I am therefore delighted that the people at Sports Direct have voted to choose the company\u2019s first UK elected workers\u2019 representative. However, not everyone is convinced that this will amount to meaningful change at the company. Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest union, last month described the move as little more than a \u201cPR exercise\u201d. Tesco\u2019s results were better than City analysts expected, with a 30% jump in operating profit to \u00a31.28bn in the year to the end of February. Under chief executive Dave Lewis, the supermarket\u2019s UK chain delivered its first full year of growth since 2009-10, with like-for-like sales (at stores open for more than a year), up 0.9%. Like other chains, Tesco has been losing shoppers to the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Phil Dorrell, partner at the consultancy Retail Remedy, said it was a good result for Lewis, who is trying to push through a \u00a33.7bn takeover of Booker, the cash-and-carry group behind the Londis and Budgens chains. Dorrell said: It\u2019s a far cry from the \u00a34bn Tesco earned 5 years ago but it is still a very healthy improvement on last years profit. The multi-pronged strategy adopted by Dave Lewis is working on all counts and just needs the Booker deal signed for a full house. Tesco is a retailer with its finger on the pulse. A clear sense of direction and a team that is fuelling the engine will be giving the competition cause for concern. Retail Vision\u2019s John Ibbotson goes further, saying Tesco\u2019s \u201cfairytale recovery\u201d continues: Tesco\u2019s fairy-tale recovery story continues. And at a time of cut-throat competition, it is all the more impressive. In his relatively short tenure, Dave Lewis has turned a thoroughly demoralised business into one with a clear sense of direction. Dave Lewis has achieved this turnaround by returning the company to the basics of retail: pricing to match the UK discounters, new and simplified product ranges, better customer service and regained customer trust in Tesco. He has also improved the relationship with suppliers and that\u2019s no small achievement. European markets are expected to open higher this morning. Here is what traders are predicting at spread betting firm IG: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Brexit-related squeeze in living standards is on, official figures on wage growth are expected to show at 9.30am. Pay growth including bonuses is expected to come in at 2.2% in the three months to February. Regular pay growth, excluding bonuses is expected to be 2.1%. Either way, that would be below February\u2019s inflation rate of 2.3%, signalling a return to falling real pay for UK workers who are just about recovering living standards after the blow dealt by the financial crisis. After the 2008 crash, inflation outpaced pay growth for six years. Inflation is rising as the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote drives up the cost of imported goods and increasingly feeds through to shop prices. The figures from the Office for National Statistics are also expected to show the unemployment rate held steady at 4.7%. We\u2019ll bring you all the details and reaction. In the corporate world, the big news this morning is from Tesco. The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain has achieved its first year of sales growth in seven years, with profits back above \u00a31bn.

Tumbling oil prices had left inflation at zero and after a couple of years of falling unemployment, annual wage growth was nudging 3%. Rising real earnings translated into a feel-good factor that delivered a political dividend for the Conservatives. Two years on, the real surprise is not the bounce-back in inflation, which at 2.3% remains modest by Britain\u2019s recent standards, but the renewed slowdown in wage growth. Unemployment has continued to fall since the general election and the jobless rate has not been lower since the 1970s. A tightening labour market is normally associated with upward pressure on earnings, but wage pressure actually seems to be abating. Earnings growth is running at half the 4% expected by the Bank of England a couple of years back. All this takes some explaining. To say the least, it is unusual for an economy to be nearing full employment with absolutely no upward pressure on wages. There are record job vacancies and reports of skill shortages, both of which would normally increase the bargaining power of employees. There are a number of possible explanations. One is that the economy is still quite a way from full employment. The labour market expert John Philpott believes the jobless rate could fall to 4% before wage pressure starts to build. Another is that there is a difference in wage growth between those workers who move jobs and those who remain with the same employee. The movers are able to negotiate better pay deals than the stayers. A third is that the 1% pay limit for the public sector \u2013 which accounts for about one in six employees \u2013 is dragging down overall earnings growth. Whatever the explanation, the squeeze on real wages will continue and intensify. Inflation is going to hit 3% later this year and will comfortably outpace earnings growth. For consumers, this will be a rerun of the first half of the last parliament, although the impact is unlikely to be as severe, since back then a combination of rocketing oil prices and higher VAT took the annual inflation rate to 5% at a time when wage growth was struggling to get above 1%. In the circumstances, it is not hard to see why George Osborne was booed by the crowd when he turned up at the 2012 London Paralympics, because there tends to be a correlation between what\u2019s happening to living standards and the popularity of the government. The current period of falling real wages could hardly have come at a worse time for Theresa May, since it coincides with the start of two years of hard bargaining to thrash out Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. Those negotiations will take place against a backdrop of people feeling poorer. Tesco\u2019s troubles are not over yet Not that you\u2019d know it from the performance of its shares, but Tesco seems to have got its mojo back. Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain has announced its first sales growth in seven years. Profits have again broken through the \u00a31bn barrier and exceeded City expectations. The dark days when the company recorded an annual loss of more than \u00a36bn \u2013 one of the biggest in UK corporate history \u2013 are now fast receding. Yet the near 6% drop in Tesco\u2019s share price made it the biggest loser in the FTSE 100. In truth, the market reaction is not a criticism of the impressive job that Dave Lewis, chief executive, has done in turning round Tesco\u2019s fortunes since his arrival in 2014. The strategy of getting the basics right has worked. Rather, the share price reflects concern that this might be as good as it gets, at least for a while. One source of anxiety is the proposed takeover of the cash-and-carry company Booker, which some of Tesco\u2019s investors are clearly unhappy about. Perhaps more significantly, supermarkets are operating in a highly competitive market that will be made even more challenging by rising inflation. In the energy sector, the lack of competition means EDF can announce it is increasing energy bills for 1.5 million customers by 8.5% \u2013 the second price hike this year. Any supermarket that tried to do the same would be committing commercial suicide. So, investors anticipate that Tesco will be forced to shield its customers from the higher cost of imported food caused by the fall in sterling, while at the same time chiselling out efficiency improvements. That\u2019s not going to be easy.",

      "bodyText": "The managing director of the International Monetary Fund has delivered one of her strongest condemnations of the protectionist policies of Donald Trump, warning that putting up barriers to trade would be a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d to an improving global economy. Christine Lagarde used a speech in Brussels to launch a strong attack on the go-it-alone approach championed by the US president during his election battle with Hillary Clinton. \u201cIn our hyper-connected world, national policies tend to have major spillovers across borders. We are all sitting figuratively in the same boat. Which is why we need to encourage countries to support strong international cooperation,\u201d she said. Speaking before the IMF\u2019s spring meeting next week, Lagarde added that international cooperation had been vital in preventing the deep recession of 2008-09 turning into a second Great Depression. After Trump picked strong critics of the IMF to be key members of his treasury team, Lagarde defended her organisation, saying it had helped foster the international cooperation that had underpinned a \u201cphenomenal rise in incomes and living standards around the world\u201d. She added: \u201cMore recently, we worked together to ensure that the great recession did not become another Great Depression. Cooperation through a multilateral framework has benefited every country. Fostering more resilient growth therefore requires more international cooperation \u2013 not less.\u201d Trump has threatened to put swingeing tariffs on Chinese goods and to impose a tax on imports coming into the US, as part of an economic strategy designed to put America first. Lagarde said cooperation was a better way of dealing with the global imbalances that had resulted in some countries, such as China and Germany, running trade surpluses while others, including the US, run deficits. This meant working together to ensure that countries observed a level playing field, including by avoiding protectionist measures. \u201cRestricting trade would be a self-inflicted wound that disrupts supply chains, hurts global output, and inflates the prices of production materials and consumer goods. And low-income households are hurt the most as they consume the largest part of their incomes,\u201d she said. The IMF will release its half-yearly health check on the global economy next week, but Lagarde hinted that the growth prospects for 2017 would be revised up. After six years of disappointing growth, Lagarde said the global economy was gaining momentum, holding out the prospect of more jobs and higher incomes. She pointed out that the outlook had improved across the developed world, including in Europe, which had previously been lagging behind the US. Even so, emerging and developing countries would contribute more than 75% of global GDP growth in 2017. \u201cAt the same time, there are clear downside risks: political uncertainty, including in Europe; the sword of protectionism hanging over global trade; and tighter global financial conditions that could trigger disruptive capital outflows from emerging and developing economies,\u201d Lagarde said. Weak productivity remained a severe drag on strong and inclusive growth, she added, largely because of population ageing, the slowdown in trade and weak private investment since the financial crisis.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has elected an employee to attend its board meetings, after a series of scandals last year over the way the company is run and treats its staff. The appointment of Alex Balacki, 30, follows a tumultuous 16 months for the retailer. This included its billionaire founder, Mike Ashley, being hauled before MPs to be questioned over \u201cVictorian\u201d working conditions at the company\u2019s warehouse, following a Guardian investigation that exposed how workers at the depot were being paid less than the legal minimum wage. Balacki is a Barnstaple store manager who has been with the company for 13 years. He will begin his 12-month role as an employee representative later this spring. However, company watchers cautioned that the new workers\u2019 representative \u2013 who is based 250 miles away from the retailer\u2019s controversial Shirebrook, Derbyshire warehouse \u2013 would struggle to effect meaningful change. Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, the business lobby group that has described Sports Direct as \u201cscar on British business\u201d, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very important that boards understand the interests of the company\u2019s staff, so it\u2019s encouraging that Sports Direct has appointed a worker representative. \u201cHowever, the firm still faces wider corporate governance issues. There remains no effective check on the power of Mike Ashley, who is majority owner and also a board director. Shareholders have tried to raise governance standards at Sports Direct but, unfortunately, I fail to see how a worker representative will be able to do so on their own.\u201d Unite, the union that has led protests against working conditions at the retailer, warned that Balacki \u201cwill face an uphill struggle to have workers\u2019 concerns heard and to resolve the deep-rooted problems across the business\u201d. The union\u2019s Luke Primarolo added: \u201cUnite wishes [Balacki] well and would like to offer to meet as soon as possible so that we can brief him on the experiences of the workforce. \u201cWe urge that he makes one of his first acts to persuade the company that agency workers on insecure hire-and-fire contracts are offered permanent appointments.\u201d The vast majority of workers at the Shirebrook depot are hired via temporary employment agencies and have fewer rights than full-time staff. In a letter to staff, Ashley said: \u201cI\u2019d like to be the first to congratulate Alex, who will help us to continue to make a positive difference by ensuring that your voice is heard in the boardroom. \u201cI have said many times that this is a company that was built by the great people who work here. I am therefore delighted that the people at Sports Direct have voted to choose the company\u2019s first UK elected workers\u2019 representative.\u201d Balacki said he was \u201cvery proud\u201d to have been picked by staff ahead of two rival candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s now my role to ensure the people of Sports Direct are heard.\u201d The company said that he is \u201cdue to attend all scheduled meetings of the board over the next 12 months\u201d, which critics complain is a watered-down version of Ashley\u2019s original proposal. Last year, when announcing the move, the billionaire said: \u201cI would like to take somebody either from the retail, the warehouse, the office, and make them a fully board member \u2013 on the board \u2013 to make sure they totally have their say, they totally have a vote. I\u2019m massively in favour of that\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s plan to encourage US companies to repatriate profits held offshore will allow the 50 biggest American corporations to save at least $300bn (\u00a3240bn), according to research by Oxfam. The US president has promised that he will get America\u2019s biggest companies to bring their vast offshore cash piles back to US soil by offering a one-off tax holiday. The plan is to tax repatriated money at 10% rather than at the statutory rate of 35%. America\u2019s 50 biggest companies had combined offshore cash piles of more than $1.6tn in 2015, according to Oxfam\u2019s research. Corporate America has been keeping the money overseas because through legal loopholes corporations can defer US taxes continually so long as income is not repatriated to the US. The amount of money held offshore, much of it in tax havens, increased by $200bn in 2015, according to Oxfam\u2019s Rigged Reform paper. Trump\u2019s proposed tax holiday would be a big boost for US technology companies which make a lot of money overseas and often park the profits in low-tax jurisdictions, such as Ireland. Apple holds more than $200bn offshore, and was last year accused of tax avoidance by the European commission and ordered to pay \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, denied the charges and dismissed the EC investigation as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d. However, he later said that he expected to bring home much of the offshore cash pile in 2017. He said Apple had set aside \u201cseveral billion dollars for the US for payment as soon as we repatriate\u201d some or all of the money. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised that his one-off 10% rate would \u201cbring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas\u201d. He said at a campaign event in Michigan: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country rather than other countries.\u201d Oxfam\u2019s research suggested that Apple would save $43.5bn in tax by taking advantage of Trump\u2019s one-off 10% repatriation tax. Other companies sitting on vast fortunes parked offshore include the drugs maker Pfizer, with $193bn, Microsoft, with $124bn, and GM, with $104bn. The Oxfam research suggested that the 50 biggest US companies could collectively save between $312 and $327bn by bringing back their offshore cash piles under Trump\u2019s tax holiday. The charity said the companies were exploiting a network of 1,751 subsidiaries in tax havens to hold cash from the US tax authorities. There is no suggestion that any of the companies have acted illegally. Ana Arendar, Oxfam\u2019s head of inequality, said: \u201cThese companies have deepened their use of tax havens and increased efforts to build influence to push for even greater tax breaks than they already have. Corporate tax dodgers cheat the US out of approximately $135bn in unpaid tax revenues every year and poor countries out of an estimated $100bn annually.\u201d The report claims that the 50 companies spent $2.5bn on lobbying between 2009 and 2015, including an estimated $352m specifically spent on influencing the tax debate. The total amount spent on lobbying works out at about $46m for every member of Congress.",

      "bodyText": "Festooned with cranes, oil pipelines and manned by a crew of several hundred, the Pioneering Spirit sits in the port of Rotterdam like a giant marine version of a forklift truck. Next month this vessel, one of the world\u2019s largest ships, will arrive in the North Sea and attempt to remove the 24,500-tonne top of a Shell oil rig installed during the oil boom years of the 1970s. If successful it will be the heaviest ever single lift of a rig\u2019s \u201ctopside\u201d, and only the second by this purpose-built $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) ship. More than 100 rigs are due to be decommissioned in UK and Norwegian waters over the next 10 years at a cost of billions to oil companies and taxpayers. The dismantling of the Delta rig in the Brent oil field is not the first such job in the UK but is believed to be the biggest. \u201cIf you remember back to the 1970s, there was not a lot of thought to decommissioning, or recycling and sustainability,\u201d said Alistair Hope, general manager for Shell\u2019s Brent decommissioning project. He described the field as a \u201cprolific national asset\u201d, having produced \u00a320bn in tax for the Treasury over its lifetime. Shell, burned in 1995 by the furore over its decision to sink the Brent Spar storage buoy at sea, is acutely aware of the need for the clean-up to go smoothly. Hope called the task of decommissioning the field an \u201cenormous challenge\u201d, due to its remote location \u2013 the closest railway station is in Bergen, Norway, nearly 150 miles away \u2013 and complex nature of the installation. In preparation for next month\u2019s operation machines have been used to cut Delta\u2019s 18-metre diameter concrete legs above the water line. Workers have welded and strengthened the topside so it does not disintegrate when picked up. In the past, the idea of removing such a huge structure in one go would have been unthinkable. However, the Pioneering Spirit is the product of decades of work by Allseas, its Dutch-Swiss owner and one of the world\u2019s two biggest oil pipeline laying companies. The unique design of the ship, built over three years in a South Korean shipyard, will be key to removing Delta and the other rigs among the 470 North Sea oil and gas installations in UK waters. The scale of the vessel is dizzying. Six jumbo jets long, it is powered by eight engines. At the stern, welders are training in preparation for the next job after Brent \u2013 that of laying a gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey. Towards the bow are eight pairs of arms, weighing 2,000 tonnes each. Inside, they are crammed with bespoke hydraulic pumps, compressors and other equipment. Once the ship has aligned itself with the Delta rig, huge pistons will push the arms, one at a time, underneath the topside. A GPS system and 12 propellers will make minute adjustments that in theory should keep the ship in place whatever the wind and waves throw at it. The arms will be attached to the rig\u2019s topside, taking about 80% of its weight. Finally, the rig will be removed with a \u201cfast lift\u201d, akin to a snatch by a weightlifter. Edward Heerema, president of Allseas, said: \u201cThe fast lift is to make sure you don\u2019t have a reimpact of the topside on the base, which you might have with a big wave. It is done with a tremendous amount of compressed air.\u201d The whole process is overseen and controlled by just a handful of people on the Pioneering Spirit\u2019s bridge, monitoring activity with numerous cameras and sensors. But while the ship\u2019s first lift of a Norwegian platform last year was performed successfully and safely, crew aboard the vessel also admit there were teething problems later fixed. Shell and Allseas are confident they have kept any risk on Delta to a minimum. They have done two test lifts on a mini-rig off the Dutch coast, once in clement August weather and another in November swells last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked on preparations for such a long time, we don\u2019t see a spot to worry particularly about. Of course, when things go wrong they come from an unexpected angle,\u201d said Heerema. At worst he anticipates a delay of a day or so. The lift operation, if all goes well, should take a day. Ultimately, the metal from Delta is destined to arrive on about 12 May at a Hartlepool scrapyard run by Able UK. Peter Stephenson, the demolition company\u2019s founder, has spent \u00a328m strengthening the quay where about 50 workers will spend a year recycling 97% of the metal. Not everyone is so happy about the Brent plans. Green groups including WWF and Greenpeace this week warned of \u201cinsufficient information\u201d from Shell and a failure to adhere to international standards set up in the wake of the Brent Spar incident. The company says it will listen \u2013 but it looks unlikely to change course.",

He described the field as a \u201cprolific national asset\u201d, having produced \u00a320bn in tax for the Treasury over its lifetime.</p> <p>Shell, burned in 1995 by the furore over its decision to sink the Brent Spar storage buoy at sea, is acutely aware of the need for the clean-up to go smoothly.</p> <p>Hope called the task of decommissioning the field an \u201cenormous challenge\u201d, due to its remote location \u2013 the closest railway station is in Bergen, Norway, nearly 150 miles away \u2013 and complex nature of the installation.</p> <p>In preparation for next month\u2019s operation machines have been used to cut Delta\u2019s 18-metre diameter concrete legs above the water line. Workers have welded and strengthened the topside so it does not disintegrate when picked up.</p> <p>In the past, the idea of removing such a huge structure in one go would have been unthinkable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI5D6ro0DIo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dI5D6ro0DIo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Pioneering Spirit leaves Rotterdam for trials</figcaption> </figure>   <p>However, the Pioneering Spirit is the product of decades of work by Allseas, its Dutch-Swiss owner and one of the world\u2019s two biggest oil pipeline laying companies. The unique design of the ship, built over three years in a South Korean shipyard, will be key to removing Delta and the other rigs among the 470 North Sea oil and gas installations in UK waters.</p> <p>The scale of the vessel is dizzying. Six jumbo jets long, it is powered by eight engines. At the stern, welders are training in preparation for the next job after Brent \u2013 that of laying a gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey.</p> <p>Towards the bow are eight pairs of arms, weighing 2,000 tonnes each. Inside, they are crammed with bespoke hydraulic pumps, compressors and other equipment.</p> <p>Once the ship has aligned itself with the Delta rig, huge pistons will push the arms, one at a time, underneath the topside. A GPS system and 12 propellers will make minute adjustments that in theory should keep the ship in place whatever the wind and waves throw at it. </p> <p>The arms will be attached to the rig\u2019s topside, taking about 80% of its weight. Finally, the rig will be removed with a \u201cfast lift\u201d, akin to a snatch by a weightlifter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi3chDAXbao\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wi3chDAXbao?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Interview with Duncan Manning of Shell</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Edward Heerema, president of Allseas, said: \u201cThe fast lift is to make sure you don\u2019t have a reimpact of the topside on the base, which you might have with a big wave. It is done with a tremendous amount of compressed air.\u201d</p> <p>The whole process is overseen and controlled by just a handful of people on the Pioneering Spirit\u2019s bridge, monitoring activity with numerous cameras and sensors.</p> <p>But while the ship\u2019s first lift of a Norwegian platform last year was performed successfully and safely, crew aboard the vessel also admit there were teething problems later fixed.</p> <p>Shell and Allseas are confident they have kept any risk on Delta to a minimum. They have done two test lifts on a mini-rig off the Dutch coast, once in clement August weather and another in November swells last year.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve worked on preparations for such a long time, we don\u2019t see a spot to worry particularly about. Of course, when things go wrong they come from an unexpected angle,\u201d said Heerema. At worst he anticipates a delay of a day or so. The lift operation, if all goes well, should take a day.</p> <p>Ultimately, the metal from Delta is destined to arrive on about 12 May at a Hartlepool scrapyard run by Able UK. Peter Stephenson, the demolition company\u2019s founder, has spent \u00a328m strengthening the quay where about 50 workers will spend a year recycling 97% of the metal.</p> <p>Not everyone is so happy about the Brent plans. Green groups including WWF and Greenpeace this week warned of \u201cinsufficient information\u201d from Shell and a failure to adhere to international standards set up in the wake of the Brent Spar incident. The company says it will listen \u2013 but it looks unlikely to change course.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The supermarket chain Asda has relaunched its value Smart Price food range as Farm Stores, reigniting the row about retailers\u2019 controversial use of \u201cfake farm\u201d brands to sell products. Asda, which pledged to replace the Smart Price branded products completely by 2018, has recently reintroduced the Farm Stores label for both meat and fresh produce after dropping it in 2001. UK farming organisations \u2013 which last year criticised Tesco\u2019s introduction of a budget range of own-label \u201cfarm\u201d brands \u2013 dismissed the latest marketing drive as misleading for consumers and insulting for farmers. But an Asda spokeswoman said: \u201cWe know how important quality produce at a great price is to our customers. We\u2019re reconnecting with our heritage by bringing back the Farm Stores brand to Asda \u2013 a name that our customers remember and trust for great value quality produce.\u201d Ruth Mason, chief food chain adviser at the National Farmers Union, said: \u201cAlthough such rebrands can drive an uplift in sales, in our view it is important that product names and descriptions are clear, accurate and do not mislead consumers. With Asda now using the term \u2018farm\u2019 within its branding, it is imperative that the origin of these products is clear to customers.\u201d In March 2016 Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest retailer, sparked controversy after launching seven brands \u2013 including \u201cWoodside Farms\u201d and \u201cBoswell Farms\u201d \u2013 based on British-sounding but fictitious names as part of its commercial fightback against the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Some of the foods were imported from overseas and given British names to make them sound local. Tesco will on Wednesday reassure investors that its crisis years are over by reporting a larger-than-expected jump in annual profits. It has won back disillusioned shoppers by focusing on lower prices \u2013 with the new farm brands key to a significant sales uplift. Peter Melchett, policy director of the Soil Association, called the latest move \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and said Asda and other retailers should instead focus on increasing the amount British food they stocked. \u2018The use of fake farm names or branding is misleading for consumers and insulting to farmers,\u201d he said. \u201cMany hard-pressed customers, trying to do their shopping in a hurry, are likely to be misled into thinking they\u2019re buying a product from a specific British farm when they are not.\u201d In July the NFU referred Tesco\u2019s \u201cfake farm\u201d branding to national trading standards for investigation, but the complicated regulatory structure meant it had to be dealt with by a local trading standards office in Hertfordshire because of Tesco\u2019s head office being in Welwyn Garden City. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has since asked lead authorities \u2013 county trading standards offices \u2013 to draw to the attention of all food businesses the relevant legal provisions regarding origin labelling.",
