      "bodyText": "Customer complaints to the big six energy companies have reached their highest-ever levels. The big six suppliers \u2013 British Gas, EDF Energy, E.ON, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE \u2013 received a total of 1.7m complaints in the first quarter of 2014, up from just under 1.5m in the same period last year, according to consumer group Which?. The quarterly performance is the worst for the sector since its biggest players started compiling records in 2012. Npower received 83 complaints for every 1,000 customers in the first quarter of 2014, which was the highest number among the six companies and up from 49 complaints per 1,000 at the same time last year. Scottish Power had the fewest complaints at 13 for every 1,000 customers. SSE, British Gas and E.ON all received around 30 complaints per 1,000 customers, with SSE's figures doubling from 13 to 27 complaints per 1,000 on the same time last year. EDF's complaints fell from 77 per 1,000 customers this time last year to 46. The suppliers have published quarterly customer complaint figures since October 2012, as required by the regulator Ofgem. They also set out their top five reasons for complaints, with difficulty in understanding bills coming top. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: \"Yet again, millions of customers are being let down by poor service from the big six energy companies. If they want to improve the low level of consumer trust in the energy market, suppliers must up their game now, rather than wait for the results of a competition review.\" In a statement, the energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, said: \"It is unacceptable that so many people have felt forced to complain to their energy supplier. \"Energy companies need to up their game - people are switching suppliers in unprecedented numbers, particularly to small suppliers whose numbers have nearly trebled since 2010.\" The shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said the figures were \"a damning indictment of a broken energy market that is failing to meet the needs of consumers. The next Labour government will undertake the biggest overhaul of our energy market since privatisation. \"Our plans will break up the big energy companies and create a tough new regulator with the power to force companies to cut their prices when wholesale costs fall.\" She said that Labour would also \"put a stop to unfair price rises by freezing energy bills until 2017, saving the average household \u00a3120\". But a spokesman for Energy UK, trade association for the industry, said: \"Most customers are happy with their energy provider. But, in an industry which serves 27m households, sometimes things can go wrong. \"Most issues just take just a call to fix even though all problems \u2013 large and small \u2013 are lumped together.\"",

Since then, London-based Silvergate Media has signed a deal with state TV to broadcast Peter Rabbit; luxury furniture maker Duresta Upholstery has announced it will open three shops in China with more than 20 planned in 2015; and London-software company TestPlant has opened an office in China.</p> <p>On Tuesday, China Minsheng Investment Corporation, a newly created private sector investment group, is expected to open its European headquarters in London, with $1.5bn (\u00a3883m) to invest in financial services, offshore projects, energy and environment.</p> <p>Another Chinese financial services group, Nord Engine, is planning to invest \u00a3150m to help Europe's small and medium-sized tech companies get into the Chinese market.

The deal will see the oil and gas group provide state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) with LNG for 20 years. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell extended an agreement with CNOOC to work on energy projects around the world, including LNG. Engineering company Rolls-Royce has signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinese nuclear reactor manufacturer SNPTC to cooperate on civil nuclear power projects in the UK and other markets. The Derby-based firm currently supplies emergency diesel generators to almost 40% of all nuclear reactors in China that are in operation or under construction. The London Stock Exchange also signed agreements with the Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China to strengthen the Chinese renminbi offshore market in the UK and to provide access to cash for Chinese companies. LSE chairman Chris Gibson Smith said: \"London is the world's most international financial market and a natural partner to China in its ambitious global development.\" At the end of last year, the prime minister led a delegation of 100 business executives to China, although Chinese state media dismissed the UK as \"an old European country\" and criticised policy on Hong Kong and the Dalai Lama. Since then, London-based Silvergate Media has signed a deal with state TV to broadcast Peter Rabbit; luxury furniture maker Duresta Upholstery has announced it will open three shops in China with more than 20 planned in 2015; and London-software company TestPlant has opened an office in China. On Tuesday, China Minsheng Investment Corporation, a newly created private sector investment group, is expected to open its European headquarters in London, with $1.5bn (\u00a3883m) to invest in financial services, offshore projects, energy and environment. Another Chinese financial services group, Nord Engine, is planning to invest \u00a3150m to help Europe's small and medium-sized tech companies get into the Chinese market. Bridget Walsh, head of Greater China business services for the UK and Ireland at Ernst &amp; Young, said British companies had a \"significant double digit opportunity over the next few years in China. \"We are not looking at doubling, we are looking at quadrupling [UK trade with China]\". \"The Chinese middle class are predicted to account for more than $6 trillion of global consumption over the next 10 years and that is a huge opportunity for British companies to take their brand to China\". She highlighted two sectors where British companies were likely to do well. Clothing and food are likely to continue to grow as the middle class expands. Secondly, companies offering architectural or sustainable development services could benefit from China's growing interest in improving quality of life in its cities.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney surprised the financial markets last week when he said interest rates could be raised from their emergency level of 0.5% sooner than the City expects. Throughout his first year at Threadneedle Street the governor of the Bank of England has talked down the prospect of higher borrowing costs, using forward guidance to reassure businesses and households that the Bank was not keen on an early tightening of policy. So what changed between the governor's doveish comments when he presented the Bank's May inflation report and his Mansion House speech a month later? Not inflation as measured by the consumer price index, clearly. That fell to 1.5% in May is and still on a downward trend. Not the producer prices index, which measures inflationary pressure in the pipeline. This shows that despite annual growth of 3%, manufacturers' factory gate prices are increasing by less than 1% a year. Not inflation expectations, a measure of where the public think the cost of living is heading. And certainly not trends in wages, where whole-economy earnings growth is running at below 1% a year. All this makes Carney's new hawkishness a bit hard to explain, particularly as he has been banging on for months about how the Bank's new macro-prudential tools will enable it to cool down the property market \u2013 the one part of the economy where inflation is a looming problem. Forward guidance, his big policy initiative on taking over as governor from Mervyn King, appears to have been junked in favour of doing what his predecessor did \u2013 assessing the state of the economy on a month-by-month basis. If you want to be generous to the governor, you could argue that he is waving the interest-rate stick in the hope that he doesn't have to use it. There are two other explanations. The first is that the governor knows something we don't, although it would be nice to know what that is. The second is that he is not quite as smart as he thinks he is and is making it up as he goes along.",

      "body": "<p>Mark Carney surprised the financial markets last week when he said interest rates could be raised from their emergency level of 0.5% sooner than the City expects. Throughout his first year at Threadneedle Street the governor of the Bank of England has talked down the prospect of higher borrowing costs, using forward guidance to reassure businesses and households that the Bank was not keen on an early tightening of policy.</p> <p>So what changed between the governor's doveish comments when he presented the Bank's May inflation report and his Mansion House speech a month later? Not inflation as measured by the consumer price index, clearly. That fell to 1.5% in May is and still on a downward trend.</p> <p>Not the producer prices index, which measures inflationary pressure in the pipeline. This shows that despite annual growth of 3%, manufacturers' factory gate prices are increasing by less than 1% a year. Not inflation expectations, a measure of where the public think the cost of living is heading. And certainly not trends in wages, where whole-economy earnings growth is running at below 1% a year.</p> <p>All this makes Carney's new hawkishness a bit hard to explain, particularly as he has been banging on for months about how the Bank's new macro-prudential tools will enable it to cool down the property market \u2013 the one part of the economy where inflation is a looming problem. Forward guidance, his big policy initiative on taking over as governor from Mervyn King, appears to have been junked in favour of doing what his predecessor did \u2013 assessing the state of the economy on a month-by-month basis.</p> <p>If you want to be generous to the governor, you could argue that he is waving the interest-rate stick in the hope that he doesn't have to use it. There are two other explanations. The first is that the governor knows something we don't, although it would be nice to know what that is. The second is that he is not quite as smart as he thinks he is and is making it up as he goes along.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Family-friendly ventures at Ryanair have in the past meant little more than asking journalists to asterisk out the swear words after press conferences. That was in the days of the higher public profile enjoyed by its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, who described having children at home as a great incentive to work long hours. But with Michael O'Leary taking a back seat on press duties, the Irish airline has made its latest step towards reinvention with a push to attract families on board \u2013 including bottle warming, changing facilities and transporting buggies and car seats free. The airline once famed for its draconian policing of baggage allowances will cut fees imposed on infants, allow parents an extra cabin bag for their children and offer discounts for their checked-in bags and other optional extras. Families can also book further trips at a reduced price. Ryanair says up to 20% of its 81 million customers are travelling as families and it wants to raise that figure. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, said: \"Families are a big deal for us. It's a group of customers that we want to get closer to. We asked them what they wanted, and they said these facilities. These will bring a new type of customer to Ryanair.\" Families can be a lucrative market for airlines as they travel predominantly in the Easter and summer seasons paying peak prices. But the airline hopes discounts for repeat bookings will encourage them to take a third trip in the less busy times. Jacobs claimed the whole package of discounts in the newly launched Family Extra scheme could save a family of four up to \u00a3400 over three trips. While offering free services appears to fly in the face of the traditional no-frills model, he said it would encourage families to fly. \"We had prices that made it quite expensive and prohibitive, but now it's an incentive for young families.\" He added: \"If young families are stressed, it's stressful for everyone. This is taking away the difficulties.\" As well as hoping to create a loyal customer base, the airline plans to use the data accumulated from bookings to start joint ventures and promotions with other businesses. Jacobs, an ex-Tesco marketing director, said that airlines have not made the most of that \"rich detail\" in the way Clubcards and similar retention schemes would target customers. The airline said it already had a greater proportion of families flying from its overseas markets, notably Poland, Portugal and Italy. The move to attract families is the latest in a series of Ryanair rebrands in less than a year since its chief executive declared a switch in strategy to stop \"unnecessarily pissing people off\", including allocated seating, less punitive charges and a new website. Allaying fears that the new Ryanair might be incurring greater costs \u2013 meaning higher fares \u2013 a spokesman revealed that the marketing video for Ryanair's family product was shot in the office, using employees' own children.",

The large economic slack has contributed to pushing down inflation to well below one percent, increasing the real burden on debtors.<br></p> <p>Growth is forecast to pickup this year, supported by exports and a gradual easing of financial conditions. However, the recovery remains fragile and unemployment unacceptably high, highlighting the need for bold and quick policy actions. Deep structural changes are needed to make Italy a more dynamic country that adapts quickly to a changing world and is home to innovative entrepreneurs. Labor markets, competition policy, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and the judicial system are four connected areas where reforms would unlock significant growth potential. Fiscal rebalancing to allow lower tax rates and increased productive spending can also lift activity.</p> <p>Prime Minister Renzi has outlined an ambitious agenda to reform the electoral law, the labor market, judicial system, and public sector. The passage of the <em>delega fiscale</em> provides a welcome framework for simplifying and improving the tax system. The government\u2019s recent announcement builds on this agenda with measures to reform the public administration, support the corporate sector, and reduce corruption. Delivery of real change is now crucial for strengthening confidence and support for reforms.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2014/061714b.htm\"><b>The full report is here</b>.</a></h2> <p><b>In it, the IMF also pushes for Labor market reforms, a shake-up of Italy's courts, a new push to fight corruption, a lower tax burden and more productive spending.</b></p> <p><i>Quite a challenge - still, Renzi did want the job...<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26184668\">enough to overthrow his predecessor Enrico Letta</a>.</i></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-06-17T16:01:47.186Z\">at 5.01pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53a05aaee4b0b8ed8e8dae9b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-17T15:19:48.557Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">CEPR: euro area might be mired in a recession pause</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ceffffa9-d841-4460-aeab-fee54a0d9321\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/17/1403018332715/ae0440af-963e-4746-ab91-4f1083ec441a-460x300.jpeg\" alt=\"The new headquarters of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.\" width=\"460\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new headquarters of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.

In line with this policy, the Bank relocated Mr Carney and his family from Ottawa to London. Procurement decisions in that process were taken by the Bank. </p> <p>The final cost of the relocation was \u00a3102,816, of which \u00a310,678 was related to 2012/13.

      "bodyText": "Time to recap: Inflation in the UK has fallen to its lowest rate in four and a half years, as supermarket price wars drove down the cost of food and drink, and transport costs also dipped. The Consumer Prices Index dropped to just 1.5% on an annual basis in May, lower than expected, to a level last seen in October 2009. The Office for National Statistics reported that food and non-alcoholic beverage prices actually fell by 0.6% in the last year, the biggest fall in almost a decade. Economists say that the drop in inflation takes pressure off the Bank of England to raise rates soon; just as the BoE becomes more hawkish itself. Expert comment starts here. The inflation data sparked a predictable political response; the government side said their economic plan was working, while the Labour opposition pointed out that real wages have been falling for years. Full story here: UK inflation falls to lowest since October 2009 The ONS also reported a 9.9% jump in UK house prices over the last year -- the fastest rate since 2010, with London prices jumping 18%. Full story here: UK house price inflation hits four-year high Speaking of the Bank of England, its annual report has shown that relocating governor Mark Carney and family to London from Canada cost more than \u00a3100,000, plus tax. More details here. The day began with Argentinia's president, Cristina Fernandez, insisting that her government will not default its debts, after losing its bid to avoid paying \"vulture-fund\" creditors who hold bonds dating back to its 2001 default. Financial markets have been digesting the implications of Argentina's defeat. The price of Argentinian debt slumped... ...and the Jubilee Debt Campaign warned that Buenos Aires's failure to persuade the Supreme Court of its case would have serious consequences for other countries in need of debt relief. This video clip from the FT explains the options. In other news... Supermarket chain Morrisons is making 2,600 staff redundant. The US inflation rate has jumped to 2.1% for May, suggesting inflationary pressures are building. German investors have become less optimistic this month, despite (or because?) of the European Central Bank's latest stimulus moves. Cyprus is expected to hold a landmark bond auction tomorrow. Economists at CEPR have warned that the eurozone recession may not be over.... ...and the IMF has warned that the Italian government needs to do a lot more to secure its recovery; including legal reforms, and cuts to spending to allow lower taxes. Back tomorrow. Thanks, and goodnight. GW The IMF also wants Italy to adjust its government spending plans -- effectively shifting funding from the older generation to the younger. It says: In the near-term, shifting resources from the highest earning pensioners towards education and active labor market policies would strengthen productivity and youth employment and help address the large inter-generational imbalance. The International Monetary Fund has urged the Italian government to push on with economic reforms as a matter of urgency. In its latest assessment of Italy's economy, just released, the IMF said Matteo Renzi's government must deliver structural reforms, cut taxes and help its banks lend to small customers. With a jobless rate of 12.6% last month , and GDP falling in the last quarter, Renzi needs to actually deliver his 'ambitious' agenda. Here's a flavour of the IMF report: A Fragile Recovery Emphasizes The Urgency of Continued Reform Steady exports and a pickup in private consumption are offsetting the stiff headwinds to investment from tight credit conditions, especially for small firms. The large economic slack has contributed to pushing down inflation to well below one percent, increasing the real burden on debtors. Growth is forecast to pickup this year, supported by exports and a gradual easing of financial conditions. However, the recovery remains fragile and unemployment unacceptably high, highlighting the need for bold and quick policy actions. Deep structural changes are needed to make Italy a more dynamic country that adapts quickly to a changing world and is home to innovative entrepreneurs. Labor markets, competition policy, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and the judicial system are four connected areas where reforms would unlock significant growth potential. Fiscal rebalancing to allow lower tax rates and increased productive spending can also lift activity. Prime Minister Renzi has outlined an ambitious agenda to reform the electoral law, the labor market, judicial system, and public sector. The passage of the delega fiscale provides a welcome framework for simplifying and improving the tax system. The government\u2019s recent announcement builds on this agenda with measures to reform the public administration, support the corporate sector, and reduce corruption. Delivery of real change is now crucial for strengthening confidence and support for reforms. The full report is here. In it, the IMF also pushes for Labor market reforms, a shake-up of Italy's courts, a new push to fight corruption, a lower tax burden and more productive spending. Quite a challenge - still, Renzi did want the job...enough to overthrow his predecessor Enrico Letta. The Eurozone may not have emerged from its recession, even though it has reported rising growth for the last few quarters. That's the verdict of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a think tank which tracks business cucles. After analysing recent data, it concluded that the euro area might be mired in a recession pause, cautioning that: Several quarters of positive but extremely weak economic developments since early 2013 do not constitute sufficient evidence that the euro area recession that started after the third quarter of 2011 is over. Under the 'classic' Western measure, a recession is two quarters or more of negative growth, ending once positive growth resumes. But the CEPR look at the underlying business cycle...and here's their logic: Since early 2013 the euro area has witnessed a prolonged episode of extremely weak growth: euro area GDP has risen by less than 1% from 2013Q1 to 2014Q1 and labour markets have shown little change over that period. Had the improvement in economic activity been more significant, it is likely that the Committee would have declared a trough in the euro area business cycle in early 2013, most likely in 2013Q1. The lack of evidence of sustained improvement of economic activity precludes, however, calling an end to the recession that started after 2011Q3. Consistent with the concerns expressed by the Committee at its October 2013 meeting, the euro area may be experiencing (since early 2013) a prolonged pause in the recession that started after 2011Q3. Philippe Weil, chair of the Committee added: \u201cThe Committee\u2019s decision not to call an end to the recession that started after 2011Q3 illustrates that its identification of peaks and troughs is not based on a mechanical rule but instead requires evidence of sustained growth. The Committee assesses both the duration and the strength of improvements in a range of economic indicators before it calls the end of a recession.\u201d Cyprus is expected to take a step closer to normality tomorrow, by selling its first government bond to banks in a 'public' sale since its 2013 bailout. The Wall Street Journal reckon the Nicosia government will look to raise at least \u20ac500m in five-year debt. Update: Cyprus did sell one small bond to a private investor recently. But this is the first time it is putting its toe back into the public debt market. Joseph Cotterill, who writes for the FT's Lex column, has a better grasp on the intricacies of the legal battle following Argentina's 2001 default than almost anyone in the business. And fortunately, he's recorded a short video explaining what yesterday's US Supreme Court ruling was all about - he dubs it \"enforcing the unenforcible\". He explains that president Cristina Fernandez has three options: pay its holdout bond holders and those investors who agreed to restructure their debt (which is prohibitively expensive!), just pay restructured debt (effectively a default), or cut a deal with the hedge funds who are demanding to be paid in full. Joseph has written a lot about the rules around Argentina's default, and the details of the Pari passu rules dictating how creditors are paid. It's all here. It's not just the big names at the Bank of England who are taking home six-figure salaries -- today's annual report shows that 632 employees were paid more than \u00a380,000 in the last year, with 330 on \u00a3100,000 or more. The Bank of England's annual report has landed, giving an insight into how the UK central bank operated last year. And there are some eye-catching facts. For starters -- the Bank has revealed that it cost more than \u00a3100,000 to transport Mark Carney from Canada to the UK last summer, to begin his stint as governor. The Bank also picked up a hefty tax bill for this. The report (online here) explains why this was necessary. It is the Bank\u2019s policy to relocate those appointed to senior positions as necessary, and to incur the costs of doing so. In line with this policy, the Bank relocated Mr Carney and his family from Ottawa to London. Procurement decisions in that process were taken by the Bank. The final cost of the relocation was \u00a3102,816, of which \u00a310,678 was related to 2012/13. Under HMRC rules, these costs, with the exception of the first \u00a316,106, are also subject to tax, and gave rise to a tax liability borne by the Bank of \u00a395,846. The report also shows that Carney received \u00a3320,00 in basic pay, \u00a3167,680 in taxable benefits (his housing allowance) and \u00a398,000 in pension contributions in the 2013-24 financial year, despite only joining the bank three months into the year, in July. More than a dozen other senior managers received salaries of at last \u00a3168,000. That doesn't include performance-related pay. And Mervyn (now Lord) King received farewell gifts to a pre-tax value of more than\u00a317,000. We learned last year that Merv swerved out of Threadneedle Street for the last time clutching a portrait of himself, a silver napkin holder, and a sculpture of the German writer, Goethe. At 2.1%, annual inflation in America's economy in May was a fair lick higher than in the UK, where prices rose by up just 1.5%, of course. That's pretty unusual - the FT's James Mackintosh reckons it's only the third time since the financial crisis was raging at its peak. Instant reaction to the US inflation data: Just in -- US inflation rate rose by more than expected last month, at the fastest annual rate since October 2012. The US consumer prices index rose by 2.1% annually in May, with prices up by 0.4% compared with April alone. That suggests inflationary pressures may, after a long lag, be inching up in America -- which means the Federal Reserve may have to give more thought to tightening its monetary policy after years of aggressive easing. Supermarket chain Morrisons has just announced that it is proposing to make 2,600 workers redundant, as part of a management restructuring. As my colleague Sarah Butler reported two weeks ago, Morrisons has been planning a major management restructuring following \"trials of three possible slimmed-down management structures in around seven of its new stores\". The redundancies come as Morrisons tries to trim costs to fund its price-cutting strategy. Apparently it's also creating new jobs across the firm.... If Argentina defaults again, the impact on other emerging markets will probably be limited, reckons analysts at Nordea: That relaxed approach, through, is very much not shared by the Jubilee Debt Campaign. Their director, Sarah-Jayne Clifton, warned: \"This decision could also have major implications for other heavily indebted countries like Greece, Ireland and Jamaica. It points to the urgent need for a fair and transparent workout mechanism for international debt, as well as for countries like the US and UK to bring forward legislation to stop predatory vulture funds profiteering from the misery of countries in debt crisis.\u201d And I must apologies for not flagging this earlier -- but one of our regular commentators, equusmulusoctopus, watched president Cristina Fernandez's speech overnight and summed up her argument: The debt that Argentina defaulted on, 160% of GDP, was unpayable. After the default in 2001, Argentina has serviced its restructured debt without recourse to \"the bicycle\", i.e. purely through growth and own resources, without debt roll-over. NLM Capital bought its bonds in 2008, seven years after the default, at a tiny fraction of their nominal value, but now demands immediate payment of the full nominal. If Argentina would pay, NLM would be cashing an interest of 1068%. Argentina has reached negotiated agreements with all its other claimants, including the Paris club and Repsol. The NLM ruling threatens to upset all that, also to the detriment of those creditors. Argentina has honoured and will continue to honour all its negotiated agreements, but it will not succumb to extortion by speculators. Back to the threat of Argentina defaulting again, after losing its appeal against honouring bonds which it defaulted on in 2001 (full details early in the blog). This chart shows how its bonds have become much riskier -- it measures the yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Argentinian bonds. Yield rises when the price of a bond falls: Newsnight's Duncan Weldon has been digging into the inflation data for some details: According to the ONS, New World wine prices rose in May \"following sales across a number of major retailers in April\". Meanwhile in Germany, investors aren't feeling as cheerful as their triumphant World Cup footballers. The ZEW institute's monthly assessment of investor confidence slipped this month to an 18-month low. It came in at just 29.8 points, down from 33.1 in May. That reflects the recent slowdown in the German economy, after a storming start to the year. But still, it's not a resounding thumbs-up to the European Central Bank's stimulus measures, either... Catherine McKinnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Treasury Minister, points out that wage rises have lagged inflation for most of the last four years. \u201cThe fall in the rate of inflation is welcome, yet most people are still feeling the squeeze. \u201cWages after inflation have now fallen by over \u00a31,600 a year under David Cameron and the link between the wealth of the nation and family finances is broken. A huge turnaround would be needed to ensure working people aren\u2019t worse off than when this Tory-led government came to office. There is a risk that Iraq conflict drives UK inflation rates higher, making it harder for households to benefit from wage rises Rob Harbron, senior economist at the Centre for Economic and Business Research, explains: The price of Brent crude oil has climbed markedly in the past ten days, rising from a low of $108 a barrel in early June to $113 a barrel yesterday. This could increase further in the coming days and weeks, as political crisis deepens in Iraq \u2013 the fear is that oil supply may be affected by conflict in the region. That's not the only geopolitical risk: In addition, Ukraine\u2019s gas supplies from Russia were cut off yesterday, a move that was followed by a 6% increase in UK gas wholesale prices. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, is cheered by today's inflation data: \u201cThe UK is experiencing low inflation and strong growth, the holy grail for economic policymakers. Inflation has almost halved from last year\u2019s peak and growth expectations for this year have almost doubled. We are in the sweet spot of the economic cycle.\u201d On the other hand.... the 9.9% jump in house prices over the last year suggests ultra-loose monetary policy is helping to fuel an asset boom in bricks and mortar. And while we have growth, workers aren't feeling the benefit. Total earnings only rose by 0.7% in the three months to April, meaning pay rises aren't matching inflation. Is this what a modern economy looks like? Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider reckons so: We Just Got The Perfect Snapshot Of A Modern Economy The pound has fallen back a little since the UK inflation data came out, as traders calculate that there's less pressure to raise rates. It has lost around 0.2 cents against the US dollar, to $1.6963, away from the near five-year high of $1.70 scaled yesterday. Ben Chu of the Independent flags up that the Bank of England has, once again, proved a little inaccurate in the forecasting department: This surprise drop in UK inflation to just 1.5% is another twist in the debate on when UK interest rates should start to rise. Last Thursday, governor Mark Carney warned that rates could rise sooner than the markets expected -- that doesn't look quite as likely now. Several analysts believe it takes the heat of the Bank of England -- after all, it's meant to keep inflation around 2% in the medium term. Here's some early reaction: Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency company World First, reckons that Bank should sit tight. \u201cThere is pressure on Mark Carney and the rest of the MPC to hike rates on the back of growth and housing market concerns, but, given their central mandate of price stability, there is little cause to alter the current policy as it stands. \u201cI was vocal in not having rates hiked when inflation peaked to 5.5% in 2011 and growth was low, as I felt it could harm the recovery. I stand by the knowledge that the UK economy has enough spare capacity and slack in labour markets to not need to tighten policy just yet\u2026\u201d Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees that the BoE now has more flexibility on borrowing costs, despite signals that it will start to raise rates soon. We suspect that 1.5% will mark the low point for consumer price inflation, but it looks well placed to remain below 2.0% for the rest of 2014, and very possibly beyond. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, comments: The inflation data will go some way to abating the aggressive calls for a rate hike from the Bank of England this year, especially so following Carney\u2019s hawkish comments last week and other more recent comments from MPC members since. We could well see one or two votes for a rate hike at the last meeting when the MPC minutes are released tomorrow \u2013 the BOE Governor may have been prepping the market for such a scenario, but this recent inflation data will put a small dent in expectations for a rate hike this year. The Office for National Statistics also reported that UK house prices jumped by 9.9% in April; the biggest rise since June 2010. And in London, prices jumped by over 18%. Bang on queue, here's that hashtag: There must be an election coming.... Because over at the Treasury, there's a scramble to welcome the news that UK inflation fell to 1.5% in May. Here's the official line from a Treasury Spokesperson, crediting David Cameron's favourite hashtag, the #longtermeconomicplan \u201cInflation has fallen to its lowest level since October 2009 and is now well below a third of its peak in September 2011. Lower inflation and rising job numbers show that the government\u2019s long term plan is working and Britain is coming back. But the job is not done, which is why we must continue to work through that plan. As the Chancellor said last week, we should remain vigilant to risks that may emerge, including from the housing market. That is why the government created the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and why last week the government announced new powers for the Bank of England over mortgage lending and radical new measures to boost housing supply. The FPC should not hesitate to use those powers if they think it necessary to protect financial stability and ensure a resilient economy. While the junior coalition partner is also keen to get some credit. Lib Dem Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, says: \"As a result of our role in Government, the Liberal Democrats have created the right climate for the recovery and the country is now getting back on the front foot. Today\u2019s inflation figures add to a developing pattern of low inflation, strengthening growth and high levels of job creation.\u2019 Britain's supermarket wars have played a big role in driving the UK inflation rate down to 1.5% last month. The ONS reports that 12-month inflation rate for food &amp; non-alcoholic beverages is currently at its lowest level for over nine years with prices falling by 0.6% compared with a year ago. This is the first annual price fall since March 2006, and shows that UK grocers are cutting prices hard in an attempt to hold up sales. Morrisons, for example, launched a big price cutting programme recently. However, since then, prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks have increased more than half as much again as the all items CPI (42% compared with 27%), the ONS added. And this chart shows which areas of spending pushed the inflation rate up, and which pushed it down: Confirmation that UK inflation hasn't been this low since the end of 2009: The Office for National Statistics says that the drop in inflation was primarily due to lower transport services costs, notably air fares, in May compared to a year ago. Other large downward effects came from the food &amp; non-alcoholic drinks and clothing sectors. But, motor fuels and recreation &amp; culture costs pushed the inflation rate higher. Just in: the UK inflation rate has fallen to just 1.5% in May, down from 1.8% in April, and the lowest reading since October 2009. That's much lower than expected -- economists had expected a reading of 1.7%. And the retail prices index (the wider measure of inflation) also fell, to 2.4% from 2.5%. Details and reaction to follow! Nearly time for the UK inflation data.... The oil price has also eased a little today, with the cost of a barrel of Brent crude dropping by half a dollar to around $112.50. That follows the news that a small number of US troops are being sent back into Iraq. Our Iraq live blog is tracking the developments: Barack Obama sends troops back to Iraq as Isis insurgency worsens BP chief Bob Dudley has also told reporters this morning that its operations in Iraq have not, yet, been impacted by the crisis. Speaking in Moscow, Dudley said: \"We are just very vigilant in Iraq. Non-essential production people have left but operations continue.\" After some nervous days, European stock markets have risen this morning as concerns over geopolitics ease, a little. And the takeover talk swirling around Shire is helping it stick to the top of the leaderboard in the City. FTSE 100: up 9 points at 6764, + 0.14% German Dax: up 84 points at 9968, +.85% French CAC: up 21 points at 4531, +0.5% The pound is sticking close to the $1.70 mark it hit yesterday, for the first time since August 2009. Overnight, one of the most dovish policymakers at the Bank of England, David Miles, told The Times he expects to vote for a rate rise by next May. So if Miles can imagine hiking within the year, his more hawkish colleagues will surely press the trigger before then..... Associated Press has a bit more detail about the unpalatable options on Argentina's platter in its battle with holdout bondholders: Refusing to comply was \"the best option\" among a series of grim alternatives that Cleary, Gottlieb, the U.S. law firm representing Argentina in Washington, presented to Fernandez ahead of the Supreme Court decision. That guidance suggested Argentina should default on all its debts before negotiating in order to gain more leverage. Europe's car industry has continued its long, slow, recovery from the eurozone crisis, with sales rising for the ninth month running. Industry body ACEA reports that registrations rose by 4.5% year-on-year in May -- continuing a record that dates back to last September. But at just 1,093,448, that's the second lowest number for May since ACEA began counting in 2003. Just under an hour until we get the latest UK inflation data, for May. City analysts predict that the consumer prices index slipped a little, to +1.7% annually. That's partly due to supermarket discounting, as Katie Allen's preview explains: Inflation predicted to have slowed after discounts buoyed economy City traders are also cheering Whitbread, pushing shares in the hotels, restaurants and coffee bar chain up by 3.5%. Whitbread reported a 9.5% growth in like-for-like sales at its Premier Inn hotels over the last three months, thanks to: \"a buoyant hotel market driven by continuing growth in London and clearer signs of economic recovery in the UK regions\u201d. No let-up in Britain's love affair with the cappuccino, either -- its Costa Coffee arm posted like-for-like sales growth of 4.5%. In the City, shares in UK pharmaceutical firm Shire have jumped 3.75% in early trading, after Reuters reported it has hired bankers from Citi to handle takeover approaches. Argentina appears to have limited options, despite president Fernandez's defiant words overnight. And they all look pretty unappealing. The vulture funds who won their case against Argentina have claimed that president Fernandez has no choice but to negotiate. Richard Samp, one of their lawyers, said the country has nowhere else to turn \"The time has come for Argentina to enter into good-faith negotiations with holdout bondholders. \"Argentina has expressed a desire to be permitted to re-enter financial markets around the world. The only way that it can do so is by coming to terms with its existing creditors.\" But paying off billionaire Paul Singer and co would be deeply politically unpalatable for Fernandez. Associated Press suggests she could find the money, by sacrificing the \"subsidies and populist programmes that enabled her to win re-election by a landslide\". But that would also mean accepting the authority of the US courts. AP explains: Argentina could win a delay of a few weeks by asking for a rehearing, but they are almost never granted. Bowing to the US courts would force Ms Fern\u00e1ndez to betray a pillar of the government that she and her late husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner, have led since he won the presidency in 2003: that Argentina must maintain its sovereignty and economic independence at any cost. And Miguel Kiguel, a former deputy finance minister (who handled three debt swaps in the 1990s), has warned refusing to comply with rulings that have been allowed to stand by the U.S. Supreme Court \"would be very damaging to the Argentine economy in the near future.\" Argentinian president Cristina Fernandez took to the airwaves overnight to insist that her country will not default on its payments to bondholders following yesterday's defeat in the US courts. In a national TV address, President Fernandez declared that Argentina would meet its commitments to investors who hold its new, restructured bonds. Her government wouldn't simply cave in to 'holdout' bondholders despite their victory on Monday. Last night's ruling appears to force Argentina to repay its 'holdout' creditors in full before repaying its 'restructured' bonds -- and it has already said it can't afford to do both. Failure to keep repaying the holders of Argentina's restructured debt would be a technical default -- and Fernandez insisted that won't happen. The next payment is due on June 30th. She said: \"We want to fulfil and honour our debt and we will do that ... I ordered the economy ministry to set up all the tools needed to make the payment to those who trusted in Argentina.\" Fernandez added that yesterday's ruling was against the interest of most of Argentina's bondholders (who had agreed to take a large cut on their debt holdings after the 2001 default). The case was brought by hedge funds who bought Argentinian debt at a discount after the 2001 default, and argue that it should be repaid in full. Fernandez appeared to suggest Argentina could negotiate with those funds, led by US businessman Paul Singer, but added: Argentina has shown a more than clear will to pay, but there is a difference between negotiation and extortion. Adding: It\u2019s our obligation to take responsibility for paying our creditors, but not to become the victims of extortion by speculators Fernandez was speaking after the Buenos Aires stock market had tumbled 10%, on fears of a fresh default. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Three events in focus today. First, Argentina -- after the US Supreme Court yesterday declined to overturn earlier rulings that it should pay billions to \"holdout creditors\" following its 2001 default. This raised fears of a new default within weeks, as we reported last night: Argentina debt crisis fears grow after US supreme court ruling Overnight, president Cristina Fernandez has insisted that Argentina cannot comply with the ruling, and pledged not to default on payments to holders of its 'restructured' bonds. More on this in a moment.... Second, UK inflation data for May, due at 9.30am. The consumer prices index is expected to dip to 1.7%, from 1.8% in April -- still some way above wage growth. Today's data will also be scrutinised for its mpact for UK interest rates?,... Thirdly, the impact of the Iraq crisis (and other geopolitical events like Ukraine) on the markets, with oil still close to its nine-month highs this morning. There's also the German ZEW index of investor sentiment due this morning, new car sales figures for Europe, and of course we'll be watching eurozone hotspots such as Greece.....",

      "bodyText": "You can understand why private equity house EQT is untroubled by a few spills in the new-issue market and is pressing ahead with a flotation of catering firm SSP. The woes of a few internet clothing firms, or a Hungarian budget airline, have little to do with a business flogging sandwiches, coffees and burgers to a semi-captive audience in airports and railway stations around the world. In any case, there is the example of Compass Group, which sold SSP to EQT in 2006, to encourage the thought that well managed providers of unfancy food and drink can be excellent investments. If you caught Compass at the bottom in 2006 \u2013 after a scandal involving \"serious irregularities\" with contracts with the UN and an unrelated Jamie Oliver-inspired kerfuffle over feeding schoolchildren turkey twizzlers \u2013 you have enjoyed a fivefold return and a fine flow of dividends. SSP would seem to enjoy similar slow-but-steady financial characteristics. Revenues increased at an average of 6.7% a year from 2007 to 2013 with profit margins tracking higher over the past three to 8.4%. There's a risk owners of airports and stations will demand a fatter slice of turnover-related rents if SSP ever became too successful. On the other hand, diversity ought to offer some protection: SSP has almost 2,000 outlets, a mix of franchises such as Burger King and wholly owned brands such as Caff\u00e8 Ritazza and Upper Crust, at 569 sites in 29 countries. For added comfort, the maestro of process-driven retail management, Kate Swann, formerly of WH Smith, is the new-ish chief executive. Swann was able to persuade punters to pay silly prices for bottled water at WH Smith's airport outlets; selling overpriced grub can't be very different. The question is the right price for SSP.

    "webTitle": "Supermarket food price battles help UK inflation fall to lowest level since 2009", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation fell to its lowest level in almost five years in May as supermarket discount wars and a sharp fall in air fares benefited shoppers and travellers. The annual increase in the cost of living, as measured by the consumer prices index, fell more than expected to 1.5% from 1.8% in April following the first annual decline in food and non-alcoholic drinks prices in more than eight years. Food prices fell 0.6% in the year to May as Britain's major supermarkets battled for customers, with the fall this May even steeper at 1.1%. Air fares fell by 6% in the year to May, and declined by 3.2% in May alone, after a big jump in April when people took trips over the Easter period. The last time the rate of inflation was as low as 1.5% was October 2009, according to the Office for National Statistics. Responding to the May inflation data on Twitter, George Osborne said: \"Good news that inflation is down to 1.5%, the lowest for five years. Another sign that our long-term economic plan is working, but lots more to do.\" Despite the fall in May, inflation is still keeping up pressure on household finances by outpacing wage growth. Pay including bonuses rose by 0.7% between February and April according to the ONS, compared with that period a year earlier. Economists said that the fall in inflation gave Bank of England policymakers flexibility over the timing of the first rise in interest rates, which have been held at 0.5% since March 2009. The City had predicted a smaller fall in the annual rate, to 1.7%. At the Bank's last quarterly inflation report in May, governor Mark Carney said the first rise was most likely in the second quarter of 2015. However, last week he said that a rise could happen \"sooner than markets currently expect\", prompting renewed speculation that the first rise could come before the end of 2014. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said families in Britain were still suffering from squeezed living standards and urged against a rise in interest rates in 2014. She said: \"Inflation may have fallen slightly but prices continue to rise faster than wages. Living standards are still on the slide, which means that for many families the recovery is far from a reality. \"An interest rate rise this year would put many hard-pressed businesses and families under even greater financial strain. Today's figures show that there is no inflationary pressure to justify such a move.\" The British Chambers of Commerce also argued the case for keeping rates on hold to reassure businesses and encourage investment. David Kern, the BCC's chief economist, said that while there might be a case for raising interest rates in early 2015, there should be no change for \"the foreseeable future\". The pound weakened on the back of the figures. Sterling, which on Monday had pushed through the $1.70 mark to a five-year high against the dollar, slipped to $1.6940 from $1.6977 before the inflation data. As well as falling food prices and air fares, lower clothing and footwear prices contributed to May's fall in inflation. In particular, women's coats were less expensive than a year earlier, as retailers raised prices last May during unseasonably cold weather. Within the food category, bread, cereal, meat, fruit and vegetable prices were all lower over the year. Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed the lower inflation figure as a victory for the Liberal Democrats. \"As a result of our role in government, the Liberal Democrats have created the right climate for the recovery and the country is now getting back on the front foot. Today's inflation figures add to a developing pattern of low inflation, strengthening growth and high levels of job creation.\" The annual rate of retail price inflation, traditionally used to calculate wage rises, fell to 2.4% in May from 2.5% in April. Ian Stewart, chief economist at accounting firm Deloitte, said low inflation and strong growth in Britain was the \"holy grail for economic policymakers\". \"We are in the sweet spot of the economic cycle,\" he added.",

      "bodyText": "Top executives from Royal Bank of Scotland on Tuesday defended the bailed-out bank from accusations that it deliberately forced customers into default to make a profit. Derek Sach, head of the RBS global restructuring group which deals with companies facing collapse, insisted that the business he ran was not a profit centre, was not aggressive to its customers and had not threatened to remove overdrafts from small business customers. Sach told MPs on the Treasury select committee: \"Generally [I] do believe we do good overall.\" He was facing questions about reports by the entrepreneur Lawrence Tomlinson, who has accused the bank of deliberately forcing customers into difficulty. He was also questioned about a report by former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Andrew Large, who said the GRG business was run as profit centre. Sach, who peppered his answers with references to businesses that RBS had saved, such as Thomas Cook and Samsonsite, said the division generated income in fees from customers in distress but also incurred costs from running the operations. Sach said the Tomlinson accusations had unsettled GRG staff, who felt they had \"impugned their integrity\". RBS, under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority following the accusations by Tomlinson, commissioned lawyers from Clifford Chance to investigate the claims, which cleared the bank of deliberately forcing businesses to the brink. Sachs admitted that criticism from Clifford Chance regarding the lack of transparency about fees was a \"reasonable criticism\". He repeated the bank's promise to remove interest fees for the first 90 days when a customer defaults. Under repeated questioning about GRG, deputy chief executive of RBS Chris Sullivan also denied the division operated as a profit centre. Sachs said that West Register, the controversial arm of RBS set up to buy properties from its customers, which the bank has now promised to shut, had bought 160 properties from small business customers for \u00a3450m and on which loans of \u00a31bn had been extended. Sachs repeatedly insisted the bank did not take a tough stance towards its customers and said there had been conflict with the now disbanded asset protection agency, set up by the government to insure RBS's more troublesome assets in 2010, which had wanted it to be tougher with its customers. The RBS pair appeared after MPs questioned executives from Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank about their sale of complex loans, such as interest rate swaps, to small businesses. David Thorburn, chief executive of the arm of National Australia Bank, said he regretted the sale of such products to some customers. Thorburn said some staff overstepped the mark when selling a certain type of loan. He also conceded that some customers had not understood the costs of the break clauses attached to some loans \u2013 which could reach 25% of the value of the loan \u2013 and that the costs had risen because interest rates had sunk so quickly to 0.5%. Debbie Crosbie, director of customer trust and confidence \u2013 a job title which Conservative MP Brooks Newmark said could have come from the BBC comedy show W1A \u2013 was also questioned.

She admitted there could be more than 550 receiving compensation from a review that only began at the start of the year. \"Nobody anticipated what would happen to break costs when they came down to emergency rates they are at today,\" said Thorburn.",

That was the strongest rise since June 2010.</p> <p>The figures were released as members of the Bank of England's financial policy committee (FPC) meet to discuss risks to the UK's financial system, with house prices expected to be a key point of discussion. Last week the chancellor, George Osborne, gave the committee new powers to curb house price rises, which have been flagged as a threat to Britain's economic recovery by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/13/risky-housing-market-uk-credit-rating-aa-plus\" title=\"\">ratings agency Fitch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/06/george-osborne-concedes-threat-rising-house-prices-uk-economy\" title=\"\">the International Monetary Fund</a>.</p> <p>The ONS said house prices were increasing strongly across most parts of the UK, with prices in the capital again showing the highest growth.

The slowest house price inflation was in Northern Ireland at 2.6% and Wales at 3.3%.</p> <p>Excluding London and the south-east, UK house prices increased by 6.3% over the year to April 2014, the ONS said.</p> <p>Economists say it is not clear whether the FPC will choose to act this soon on the housing market. Its options include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/13/bank-of-england-tame-housing-market\" title=\"\">requiring banks to hold more capital against higher-risk home loans</a> as well as recommending changes to the government's Help to Buy scheme.

      "bodyText": "UK house price inflation has hit a four-year high, according to official figures that will intensify the debate about whether policymakers need to take steps to cool the market. The average UK house price rose by 9.9% over the year to April, up from 8% inflation in March, driven largely by increases in London, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. That was the strongest rise since June 2010. The figures were released as members of the Bank of England's financial policy committee (FPC) meet to discuss risks to the UK's financial system, with house prices expected to be a key point of discussion. Last week the chancellor, George Osborne, gave the committee new powers to curb house price rises, which have been flagged as a threat to Britain's economic recovery by ratings agency Fitch and the International Monetary Fund. The ONS said house prices were increasing strongly across most parts of the UK, with prices in the capital again showing the highest growth. London prices rose 18.7%, the biggest increase since July 2007. The rise in house prices contrasted with separate official figures showing inflation falling to a five-year low of 1.5% in May. That left policymakers at the Bank with more mixed news on the economy, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \"The divergent data will further complicate the discussion about the appropriate timing of the first increase in interest rates from their current record low,\" he said. The fast house price growth in London was followed by the south-east at 8.9% and the east at 8.5%. The slowest house price inflation was in Northern Ireland at 2.6% and Wales at 3.3%. Excluding London and the south-east, UK house prices increased by 6.3% over the year to April 2014, the ONS said. Economists say it is not clear whether the FPC will choose to act this soon on the housing market. Its options include requiring banks to hold more capital against higher-risk home loans as well as recommending changes to the government's Help to Buy scheme. The committee will unveil any decisions in its Financial Stability Report on 26 June. Some commentators say the Bank can afford to hold off acting on house prices, given recent signs the market may be turning. \"Latest mortgage data and survey evidence suggest that housing market activity has \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 lost momentum recently,\" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. \"This looks to be at least partly due to the introduction of new regulations under the Mortgage Market Review. While the MMR only came into effect on 26 April, it is evident that some banks raised their mortgage lending standards before the new regulations kicked in.\" Nationwide, Britain's biggest building society, said last month that the London property market was heading for a \"natural correction\" with the frenetic pace of buying beginning to fade. This week, Rightmove, the UK's biggest property website, said prices for homes have come \"off the boil\". For the first time this year, the asking prices posted on the Rightmove website for homes in London fell by 0.5% in early June, compared with the month before, in part owing to a rapid increase in sellers rushing to cash in on rising prices.",

      "bodyText": "Whitbread, the UK's largest hotel and restaurant operator, has reported a strong start to the year, with surging customer demand for a bed at Premier Inn, a drink at Costa Coffee and a meal in its pub-style restaurants. The company's shares were the second-biggest riser on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday, gaining over 3% to \u00a342.98. Whitbread reported a 9.5% growth in like-for-like sales at its Premier Inn hotels over a 13-week period to the end of May, as it benefited from \"a buoyant hotel market driven by continuing growth in London and clearer signs of economic recovery in the UK regions\". Bed occupancy rates rose to 80.7% in London and 80% across the UK, a rise of between four and five percentage points.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound climbed to a near five-year high against the dollar as markets reacted to the prospect of an interest rate hike before Christmas. Sterling broke through $1.70 for the first time since August 2009 during a volatile day for financial markets that saw the Iraq crisis spur a rise in the oil price and a shares sell-off across Europe. After Bank of England governor Mark Carney said last Thursday that borrowing costs could rise from their record low sooner than markets expected, investors have been scrambling to reposition for a hike this year. Attention is now turning to the publication on Wednesday of minutes from the Bank's latest rate-setting meeting, with some commentators saying they might even show that one member of the nine-strong committee pushed for a rate rise from 0.5% this month. Although some economists had already predicted the Bank might have to raise interest rates in 2014 as the economy gathers steam, Carney had until now repeatedly played down speculation of a hike this year. Chris Turner, strategist at ING, commented on the U-turn: \"Now we are told to expect a rate increase sooner rather than later. Such dramatic changes in the BoE view are much more in line with where we see the UK economy, but do give the impression of a central bank which has been running behind the curve.\" The pound rallied on Carney's remarks and added to gains as speculation grew that talk of rate hikes in the minutes was what prompted the change of tune. At one, point the pound hit $1.7011, although later fell back to $1.6984. The movement in sterling is good news for holidaymakers ahead of the peak summer season, but a hindrance for British exporters who are in the vanguard of George Osborne's manufacturing-led march of the makers. The strength of sterling has stemmed from the contrasting outlooks between the UK and other advanced economies, where central banks are seen waiting longer before ending the ultra-loose policy put in place during the financial crisis. The US Federal Reserve meets this week and investors will be looking for clues as to when it will start to raise rates from 0.25%. \"Wednesday's Bank of England minutes and Federal Reserve policy announcement could prove pivotal for sterling,\" said Nawaz Ali, UK market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. \"If the two updates highlight the increasing policy divergence between the two central banks, GBP/USD could finally make a sustained break through the critical $1.7000 barrier, which could then potentially open up a move towards the $1.7100 to $1.7250 range.\" The pound also managed some short-lived gains against the euro. It hit a 20-month high of 79.59p before easing back to around 79.85p against the European single currency, which has come under pressure as the European Central Bank loosens policy to tackle worryingly low inflation. Further support for the pound came from remarks by retiring Bank deputy governor Charlie Bean. He reinforced speculation of a rate rise before the end of the year by telling the Sunday Times that a move would be \"a symbolic step, because it will be an indication that we are on the road back to normality.\" He added: \"Frankly, having interest rates at an emergency level for a very long time is not a situation one wants to be in.\" Financial markets have now fully priced-in a hike by the end of 2014 but analysts are divided over how soon and how far borrowing costs go up again after that first move. Many predict the strength of sterling will make the Bank cautious. Policymakers at the Bank themselves have stressed that when they raise rates, they will do so only gradually. \"A late-2014 rate increase does not necessarily mean we should not expect a second move to occur so quickly,\" said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank. \"For one thing, the BoE will not wish to put too much upward pressure on sterling given that the Fed is unlikely to move until the spring and the ECB is also conducting a policy of aggressive easing.\" Elsewhere in financial markets, oil prices rose as the crisis in Iraq raised supply fears. Brent crude rose as high as $113.28 before ceding some ground to stand at $112.98 around the time of the London markets close. Geopolitical tensions also saw shares fall across Europe, with London's FTSE 100 index of bluechip stocks closing down 0.3% at 6,754.6.",
