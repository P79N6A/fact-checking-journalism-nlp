The latter was essentially insolvent, surviving on a liquidity lifeline from the central bank.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde of the IMF wanted both banks, representing a half of the Cypriot banking sector, closed down. In the end Laiki is being closed down with its bond- and shareholders facing huge losses and \u20ac4.2bn euros in deposits looking lost. Bank of Cyprus will become a shadow of its former self, deposits frozen pending restructuring and downsizing and wealthy depositors facing losses probably of 30-40%.</p> <p>&#xa0;A \u201ccasino economy\u201d, said the French government. \u201cA dysfunctional business model,\u201d said the Germans of the Cypriot economy.With a banking sector 7 times Cypriot gross domestic product, Lagarde insisted this was unsustainable and that it would be more than halved to around 3 times GDP by 2018.</p> <p>&#xa0;In a time of embryonic eurozone bank supervision, with the European Central Bank being made the supervisory authority for all eurozone banks, the statements from Berlin and Lagarde bore the hallmark of a new policy aimed at taming financial services and getting bloated banking sectors under tight control.</p> <p>&#xa0;Which explains why several small countries are trembling at the prospect of what might be in store. Malta, Luxembourg and Cyprus are the three smallest countries in the EU and the eurozone. Cyprus\u2019s days as an offshore tax and banking haven are now numbered. Relative to gross domestic product, tiny Malta\u2019s banking sector is even bigger. Its finance minister sat next to his German and Cypriot counterparts at the first Cyprus bailout meeting in Brussels 10 days ago and was extremely chastened by what he witnessed. After experiencing Wolfgang Schaeuble, the German finance minister, up close, he wrote an article in the Malta Times saying God help his country if it encounters similar problems in the eurozone.</p> <p>&#xa0;Then there is Luxembourg, which along with Austria, is the eurozone\u2019s biggest champion of banking secrecy. The wealthiest country in the EU and second smallest, Luxembourg\u2019s banking sector exceeds its GDP by a whopping factor of 23.</p> <p>&#xa0;The big difference, of course, is that these are not Luxembourg banks, but subsidiaries of the European and US banking giants, with Germany and France to the fore. Nonetheless Jean Asselborn, the Luxembourg foreign minister, warned Berlin on the eve of the Cyprus bailout that it needed to watch its words, that no one was complaining that the German car or arms industries were too big.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5150617ab5795d794abf444f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-25T14:38:50.726Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in the Greek city of Thessaloniki, a group of protesters shows solidarity with Cyprus today during a parade to mark Greece's independence day.</p> <p>They carried a banner reading:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are all Cypriots.

My colleague <strong>Josephine Moulds</strong> just put that question to bond analyst <strong>Gary Jenkins</strong> of Swordfish Research, prompting a huge laugh from the other end of the phone. He said (once he'd recovered himself):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a way this is just the beginning of their problems. They\u2019ve stopped the old business model [attracting deposits from wealthy individuals] but it hasn't been replaced with anything else.</p> </blockquote> <p>He notes that the EU has made no economic projections for Cyprus, so has no idea how or when it will get its \u20ac10bn back from this country.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They are never going to see that \u20ac10bn back. The economy is crushed for the next God knows how many years. As soon as people can take their money out the banks, they will take it out. If I've \u20ac10,000 in the Bank of Cyprus, why would I leave it there?</p> <p>Anyone\u2019s guess would be that the economy is going to crash in these circumstances. Confidence has disappeared. What is the impact on Cypriot companies? Has noone looked at how many corporates have over \u20ac100,000 in the bank? Who\u2019s going to want to do business with Cypriot corporates right now?</p> </blockquote> <p>Gary's conclusion...</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a nuclear bomb to crack a nut. If you\u2019re worried about money laundering go after money launderers. Don\u2019t go after Cypriot nationals.</p> </blockquote> <p>The deal will also have a major impact on banks in Spain and Italy, he says.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you\u2019re a US company, US politicians have been talking about how to get the money back from overseas. No non-Italian and non-Spanish companies are going to keep their money there.</p> </blockquote> <p>Similarly, he says, normal people banking in Spain and Italy will now likely pull their money out of the bank at the first sign of trouble, prompting disastrous bank runs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With regard to this subject I must say I have found some of the comments as to why this wouldn\u2019t happen interesting. Many have said how much better capitalised Italian and Spanish banks are, and how it is well known that the Cypriot banking system as a percentage of GDP was way bigger than other European countries.</p> <p>Quite right (although I have my doubts as to the real strength of many of these banks) but do they really think that the average person in the street has any interest about such statistics? In the event of a major problem do you think that people will say \u2018oh I will leave my money in the bank because their tier one ratio is 10% and as our banking system is nowhere near as big as the Cypriot one on a relative scale?\u2019 If they do they are likely to be crushed underfoot in the rush as others decide not to take any chances.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-515014c495cbbc3a59c25da3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-25T09:11:32.856Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso looked satisfied, and tired, as the Eurozone meeting broke up early this morning:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f453961b-5ac0-4f5f-92fa-2884632bc965\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/25/1364202594837/3227c6e3-4984-4548-a121-8d24109192c0-460x335.jpeg\" alt=\"European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso (L) leaves following a Eurozone meeting early on March 25, 2013 at EU headquarters in Brussels.  \" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: GEORGES GOBET/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-515013f595cbbc3a59c25da1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-25T09:08:05.397Z\">9.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The best early reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/meet-the-team/joseph-cotterill/\">Joseph Cotterill</a> of FT Alphaville has written the best detailed analysis of the Cyprus deal: <strong><a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/03/25/1437052/scratch-one-stupid-idea/\">Scratch one stupid idea [Updated]:</a></strong></p> <p>Here are the key points (head over to AV for the full read (<em>then come back!</em>))</p> <p><strong>1) In case you didn\u2019t get the memo the first time, this still isn\u2019t about spanking money-launderers. </strong>(because there's no differentiation between foreign and domestic customers with over \u20ac100k)</p> <p><strong><strong>2) It\u2019s a depositor bail-in \u2014 for two specific banks, one of which is in full resolution. </strong></strong>(rather than forcing all customers at all banks to contribute, as in the first - hated - bailout plan)</p> <p><strong><strong><strong>3) It\u2019s also a senior bank bond bail-in. </strong></strong></strong>(Holders of Laiki\u2019s senior unsecured debt look fully wiped out - those at Bank of Cyprus will take a brisk haircut)</p> <p><strong><strong><strong><strong>4) Emergency Liquidity Assistance.</strong> -- Was this the week we found out that <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/tag/ela/\">ELA</a> will be protected from default no matter what? </strong></strong></strong>(under the deal, the assistance supplied by the European Central Bank to Laiki is now transferred to Bank of Cyprus)</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>And over at Reuters, Felix Salmon points out that the winding-down of Laiki is a rather big deal for a rather small country:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The resolution of Laiki is going to give the world a very real example of what happens when a too-big-to-fail bank is allowed to fail.</p> <p>Laiki is small by global standards, but very large by comparison with Cyprus\u2019s GDP. If Cyprus can survive Laiki\u2019s collapse, then maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 the world could cope with the \u201cresolution\u201d of a big bank like Citigroup. But that\u2019s a very big \u201cif\u201d.</p> <p>More likely, the costs to Cyprus of allowing Laiki to fail will be enormous, both politically and economically.

      "bodyText": "The decision to keep banks closed until Thursday was taken in order to train personnel and ensure that software was updated, according to Prodromos Prodromou, an MP from the governing DISY party who was speaking on the BBC's flagship current affairs show, Newsnight. On that note we are wrapping up the blog now. Here is a summary of developments today: \u2022 Fears that bank accounts could be raided in any future eurozone bailouts spooked markets on Monday, as Cypriots prepared for some of their banks to reopen for the first time in 10 days following a deal to secure a \u20ac10bn lifeline. \u2022 Markets took fright after the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers indicated that the Cyprus rescue could be a template for similar situations. \u2022 The president of Cyprus assured his people a bailout deal he struck with the European Union was in their best interests, but banks will remain closed until Thursday and even then subject to capital controls to prevent a run on deposits. Fear of banks being besieged when they reopen after being shut all last week saw plans for their reopening put back until Thursday, according to Reuters: The Central Bank said the decision was taken to ensure the \"smooth functioning of the whole banking system\". Earlier, the Central Bank had announced most banks would open on Tuesday, with the exception of Popular Bank and Bank of Cyprus, the island's two largest lenders which would reopen on Thursday. Faisal Islam, economics editor of Channel 4 News, meanwhile tweets: Cyprus should plainly have accepted the bail-out terms as offered eight months ago, writes Jeremy Warner, assistant editor of The Daily Telegraph, in a thought-provoking piece. He adds: By refusing, Cyprus has allowed itself to fall victim to the demands of the German ballot box. With national elections looming in September, Germany\u2019s two main political parties have become increasingly intransigent in their demands. For domestic political reasons, Berlin wanted to see large depositors in Cypriot banks punished, even though the eventual knock-on costs for the eurozone as a whole of bailing them in are likely to be far larger than bailing them out. Reports are coming through that the Cypriot authorities have ordered all banks to remain closed tomorrow. The Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, has warned that the global financial crisis is \"far from over\" and that fundamental changes are needed to the international system before confidence can be regained. He said in a speech earlier at an event at the London School of Economics: Whichever crisis we are talking about, it is far from over \u2026 there will surely be many unexpected twists and turns before we can truly say that the crisis is indeed over. Philip Inman of the Guardian was covering the event and observes in a report (online in full here): On the day after the Cypriot government put forward a rescue package to stabilise its economy, King's comments will reinforce concerns that the eurozone has failed to put its house in order. The event was also attended by Ben Bernanke (below), chair of the US Federal Reserve, who voiced concerns about fundamental imbalances exposed by the financial crisis. He said that while the eurozone works for some countries, it was obvious that others were unable to keep up. \"There is a basic question: what is the right size for a single monetary policy?\" The crisis over Cyprus shows that trust in the ECB is misplaced, writes economist Megan Green in a piece for Bloomberg. Greene, who is the chief economist at Maverick Intelligence, writes that complacency has pervaded Europe\u2019s single-currency area ever since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said last July that the bank will do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. She adds: Whatever happens in Cyprus is unlikely to ring the death knell for the common currency. A chaotic default and exit from the euro area by such a tiny economy would be disruptive, but the rest of the currency union would probably weather it. The Cyprus debacle has revealed, however, that the ECB isn\u2019t a cure- all, and that investors\u2019 trust in the willingness and ability of the central bank to \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d may be a big mistake. Some reaction now to that Anastasiades speech from earlier: Cypriots in the UK who face losing large amounts of their savings have been talking to my colleague, Sam Jones, and blame EU, Germany and the single currency. At the Finchley branch of Laiki Bank, customers were broadly confident that their UK deposits would remain untouched by the crisis, including a businessman who has banked with the institution for almost half a century, and was happy to accept its assurances: His faith was echoed by the delivery driver sitting with his mate in the cab of a lorry outside the branch. \"We've got a few accounts here and we came to get reassurance,\" he said. \"And I do feel reassured \u2013 but then I don't have over \u20ac100,000 in the bank.\" While he had resisted the temptation to withdraw his money as he didn't want to be a scaremonger, he did have a plan B. \"If it goes tits up, we'll have to get the money from Cyprus,\" he said. His more cynical colleague couldn't decide who deserved the most blame: the banks or the EU. \"Banks are thieves but they are legal thieves,\" he mused. \"But it's Europe bullying Cyprus because Cyprus is a small country.\" US markets had largely shrugged off news from Cyprus amid growing sings of recovery at home, writes Dominic Rushe, the Guardian's US business correspondent As Dominic points out, Cyprus\u2019s GDP at $23.57bn is a little bit more than Goodyear, the tire company, brings in in revenues each year. But US investors turned jittery as details of Dijsselbloem comments emerged after markets opened up Monday on news of a breakthrough in Cyprus: All the major US markets were down by the afternoon with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down over 70 points, 0.5%. Jeff Weniger, senior investment analyst at BMO private Bank, said: \u201cThe economy of Cyrus is I think 1/500th of the EU but these signals are worrying. It\u2019s these sudden changes in policy that unnerve the markets.\u201d He said changes in US monetary policy was clearly signaled by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. \u201cYou know where he is heading, whether you agree or disagree. With Europe I come in Monday morning and it\u2019s a different story again.\u201d The Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades announced plans by his government to appoint investigators \"to find out where responsibility lies\" in relation to what has happened in the country over the past two weeks. In a television address in the past hour, he told Cypriots that \"tomorrow will be a new day\"for the country, which he claimed would be able to leave behind the uncertainty of the past few months and look with optimism to the future. Difficult decisions will be implemented over the coming days, he said, including the enforcement of capital controls by the central bank. \"I would like to assure you that this is a temporary measure,\" he added, pledging to focus on policies that would create jobs and growth. There were also not entirely cryptic words for the way in which the crisis had been handled by those from beyond the island. Anastasiades spoke of the \"disappontment that we all feel for the attitude of some of our partners\" but made his opposition to a eurozone exit clear. The Russian oligarch, Alexander Lebedev, believes he stands to lose no more than $10,000 in Cyprus, saying: \"It's not worth talking about\". Lebedev, owner of the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, was speaking by telephone from Moscow to the Guardian's Miriam Elder. He expressed doubts that expressed doubts that capital controls to be imposed by the Cypriot government in order to stem a bank run would work: Certain schemes can be put into place.... This is how Cyprus was making money. In terms of the significance of Cyprus, he told Miriam: Cyprus was always a transit jurisdiction \u2013 money would pass through and then go to Lithuania, Latvia, Belize, Switzerland, everywhere, There are plenty of ways [to avoid capital controls], they can split accounts... It\u2019s not worth talking about. Jeroen Dijsselbloem has just released a statement insisting that Cyprus is a 'specific case' It's an attempt to repair some of the damage caused since his interview to the Financial Times and Reuters hit the electronic streets. Statement by the Eurogroup President on Cyprus Cyprus is a specific case with exceptional challenges which required the bail-in measures we have agreed upon yesterday. Macro-economic adjustment programmes are tailor-made to the situation of the country concerned and no models or templates are used. Hope that's clear. Probably a good moment to hand over to Ben Quinn for future developments this evening. Thanks all. GW My colleague Helena Smith has been taking the temperature in Nicosia today, where many are upset about the Cypriot bailout: In the confusion of a deal whose details remained elusive, many complained that, once again, democracy had been circumvented \u2013 with Nicosia's 56-member parliament having no say over an agreement that had ultimately been drawn up in Brussels. \"It is illegal and undemocratic,\" said Christos Tombazos, general secretary of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour. \"We're talking about massive changes to the banking system. It should go to referendum for the Cypriot people to decide.\" Cyprus saved \u2013 but at what cost? Helena also flags up that there are reports tonight that most of Cyprus's banks will open tomorrow, with the exception of Laiki and the Bank of Cyprus, who will reopen on Thursday. The European Central Bank has announced that it will continue to supply liquidity to Cyprus's banking sector, following the bailout deal agree this morning. Here's the statement, confirming that Cypriot banks can keep running: ECB\u2019s reaction to the agreement on the Cypriot macroeconomic adjustment programme The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) acknowledges the agreement reached by the Eurogroup with the Cypriot authorities, which outlines the necessary key elements of the EU/IMF adjustment programme for Cyprus. The Governing Council also notes the agreement reached on restoring the viability of the Cypriot financial system in order to finance the Cypriot economy. Now steadfast implementation is key for Cyprus to regain access to financial markets and return to growth as soon as possible. Today, the Governing Council decided not to object to the request for provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) by the Central Bank of Cyprus, in accordance with the prevailing rules. It will continue to monitor the situation closely. [end] The ECB warned last week that it would step away from Cyprus tonight if a bailout deal hadn't been reached. Tonight's TV address from Cyprus's president, Nicos Anastasiades, has reportedly been delayed until 6.15pm GMT (from 5pm) Here's the damage in Europe's stock markets, where there were sharp falls in Spain and Italy in late trading as bank shares were buffered by Jeroen Dijsselbloem's comments. FTSE 100: down 14 points at 6378, - 0.2% German DAX: down 40 points at 7870, -0.5% French CAC, down 42 points at 3727, - 1.1% Italian FTSE MIB: down 401 points at 15644, - 2.5% Spanish IBEX: down 188 points at 8140, -2.3% The euro has now fallen more than a cent against the US dollar, to $1.285. The backtracking begins, with Dijsselbloem's spokesperson confirming the quotes are accurate, but the suggestion Cyprus is a template is apparently taken out of context. Decide for yourselves, dear readers... Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, argues that the markets have got too excited by Dijsselbloem's comments: But a regular reader from Greece, James Wilkins, points to the new uncertainty the Eurogroup head has created: Can Mr Dijsselbloem tell us which banks are good banks and which banks are bad banks so that we know where to deposit our money? The Financial Times just published its news story on Jeroen Dijsselbloem's comments, and it's the same angle as Reuters. Cyprus to be model for future bailouts The \u20ac10bn Cypriot rescue marks a watershed in how the eurozone deals with failing banks, with European leaders now committed to \u201cpushing back the risks\u201d of paying for bank bailouts from taxpayers to private investors, the chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers has warned. Jeroen Dijssebloem, the president of the eurogroup, said the relative market calm in recent months, coupled with the lack of market panic following the decision to force private investors and depositors to pay for the entire bailout of two large Cypriot banks, allowed the eurozone to go after private money more aggressively when banks fail. So Jeroen Dijsselbloem has managed to make himself the top news story on FT.com, along with an authoritative wire version which every other newspaper could trust and run with..... Here's some early reaction to Dijsselbloem's comments about how Cyprus's rescue could set a precedent. Not everyone thinks it's a disastrous idea. Not quite everyone, anyway. First the negative reaction: However, Sony Kapoor of the ReDefine thinktank is supportive: The full interview with Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem that has spooked the markets is online here: After Cyprus, eurozone faces tough bank regime - Eurogroup head A rescue programme agreed for Cyprus on Monday represents a new template for resolving euro zone banking problems and other countries may have to restructure their banking sectors, the head of the region's finance ministers said. Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has sent the euro tumbling by declaring that the Cyprus rescue should be seen as a template for the rest of the eurozone. In an interview with reporters in Brussels after the Cyprus plan was agreed, Dijsselbloem argued that Europe could now take a new approach to tackling struggling banks. Dijsselbloem said (via Reuters): What we've done last night is what I call pushing back the risks. If there is a risk in a bank, our first question should be 'Okay, what are you in the bank going to do about that? What can you do to recapitalise yourself?'. If the bank can't do it, then we'll talk to the shareholders and the bondholders, we'll ask them to contribute in recapitalising the bank, and if necessary the uninsured deposit holders. Dijsselbloem, who began his term as Eurogroup president by presiding over the botched original bailout for Cyprus, argues that it's fair for big depositors to take the hit: If we want to have a healthy, sound financial sector, the only way is to say, 'Look, there where you take on the risks, you must deal with them, and if you can't deal with them, then you shouldn't have taken them on.... The consequences may be that it's the end of story, and that is an approach that I think, now that we are out of the heat of the crisis, we should take That last line is a concern -- are we really in calm waters now? With no stable government in Italy (or even an instable one), Greece trudging through another year of recession, Portugal and Ireland striving to exit their bailout. And don't even mention France. The key to Dijsselbloem's comments is that he's suggesting that Europe will no longer need the ESM -- the \u20ac700bn bazooka that was meant to be on standby to prevent a banking collapse, by injecting new capital when needed. He said: We should aim at a situation where we will never need to even consider direct recapitalisation. If we have even more instruments in terms of bail-in and how far we can go on bail-in, the need for direct recap will become smaller and smaller. The interview has sent the euro sliding, and pushed shares down across Europe. Trading in several Italian banks have just been temporarily suspended (for dropping more than 5%). Reaction to follow! From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor explains why other small countries with large banking sectors are very nervous following the Cyprus bailout: For the architects of the Cyprus bailout, the German government and the International Monetary Fund, there was no doubt that the central aim of the shock therapy was to bring down an oversized banking sector that was failing, especially the Bank of Cyprus, the island\u2019s biggest and Laiki, the number two. The latter was essentially insolvent, surviving on a liquidity lifeline from the central bank. Christine Lagarde of the IMF wanted both banks, representing a half of the Cypriot banking sector, closed down. In the end Laiki is being closed down with its bond- and shareholders facing huge losses and \u20ac4.2bn euros in deposits looking lost. Bank of Cyprus will become a shadow of its former self, deposits frozen pending restructuring and downsizing and wealthy depositors facing losses probably of 30-40%. A \u201ccasino economy\u201d, said the French government. \u201cA dysfunctional business model,\u201d said the Germans of the Cypriot economy.With a banking sector 7 times Cypriot gross domestic product, Lagarde insisted this was unsustainable and that it would be more than halved to around 3 times GDP by 2018. In a time of embryonic eurozone bank supervision, with the European Central Bank being made the supervisory authority for all eurozone banks, the statements from Berlin and Lagarde bore the hallmark of a new policy aimed at taming financial services and getting bloated banking sectors under tight control. Which explains why several small countries are trembling at the prospect of what might be in store. Malta, Luxembourg and Cyprus are the three smallest countries in the EU and the eurozone. Cyprus\u2019s days as an offshore tax and banking haven are now numbered. Relative to gross domestic product, tiny Malta\u2019s banking sector is even bigger. Its finance minister sat next to his German and Cypriot counterparts at the first Cyprus bailout meeting in Brussels 10 days ago and was extremely chastened by what he witnessed. After experiencing Wolfgang Schaeuble, the German finance minister, up close, he wrote an article in the Malta Times saying God help his country if it encounters similar problems in the eurozone. Then there is Luxembourg, which along with Austria, is the eurozone\u2019s biggest champion of banking secrecy. The wealthiest country in the EU and second smallest, Luxembourg\u2019s banking sector exceeds its GDP by a whopping factor of 23. The big difference, of course, is that these are not Luxembourg banks, but subsidiaries of the European and US banking giants, with Germany and France to the fore. Nonetheless Jean Asselborn, the Luxembourg foreign minister, warned Berlin on the eve of the Cyprus bailout that it needed to watch its words, that no one was complaining that the German car or arms industries were too big. Over in the Greek city of Thessaloniki, a group of protesters shows solidarity with Cyprus today during a parade to mark Greece's independence day. They carried a banner reading: We are all Cypriots. Together we will send away Troika and Memorandums Members of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party attempted to disrupt the display of support: If Cyprus wants a taste of life after a few years under an IMF-led austerity package it could turn to Ireland. One fifth of shops in Ireland's second city Cork are now vacant as the Republic suffers its worst six months of high street trading. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: The closure of Cork based electrical retailer Flor Griffin as well as UK companies like HMV and Game on Irish main streets reflects continued depressed demand among still debt ridden consumers. The Republic's Chambers of Commerce and Retail Excellence Ireland are demanding action such as lower rents and commercial rates to halt the retail downturn. Evidence from trade groups over the first quarter of this year reveal that in parts of central Dublin 24% of retail units lie empty. Overall more than ten per recent of retail units in the Irish capital lie idle while in Athlone, a town in central Ireland that successfully attracted foreign multi national investment nearly 20 per cent of shops are empty. The ongoing downturn in domestic demand is due to frugal Irish consumers worried over mortgage and other personal debts being too frightened to spend. Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Merrion Stockbrokers, believes the Irish government was on its way to reaching its target of 1.5% growth this year. But McQuaid issued a warning that the Cypriot fiscal crisis could have a ripple effect on the Irish economy at the other end of the EU. \u201cAssuming the Cyprus problem doesn\u2019t blow up into a full scale Eurozone crisis, then there is no reason why the Irish government can\u2019t meet its official growth target for the second year running,\u201d he said. On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average is up just 40 points higher at 14552, with news of last night's deal failing to spark much of a rally. US markets have been largely untroubled by the Cyprus news in recent weeks. Dominic Rushe reports: Unlike the roller coaster ride US markets endured during the height of the Greek crisis, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much fear of contagion. During the Greek crisis investors liked to point out that the Greek economy was worth about the same as the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Cyprus\u2019s GDP at $23.57bn is a little bit more than Goodyear, the tire company, brings in in revenues each year. The Dow snapped a four week winning streak last week, closing down 2.08 points. But that\u2019s a mere 0.01% for the week and it actually closed up on Friday. European Commission officials told reporters in Brussels this lunchtime that capital controls in Cyprus are only likely to be implemented for a short time. Commissioner Michel Barnier told reporters that: Any measures to restrict or limit freedom of movement may only be enacted exceptionally and temporarily and that is what has been requested by the Cypriot authorities. Capital controls will mean very tough restrictions on bank account access and the movement of cash out of Cyprus, to help prevent a bank run. James Mackintosh of the FT points out that capital controls can be a hard habit to break: There were peaceful protests against the bailout deal outside Greece's embassy in Nicosia this morning, during a parade of high school students to mark Greek independence day: Faisal Islam, Channel 4's economics editor, was there - and reported that parents were desperately worried about how the crisis will affect their children's lives. Despite describing the haircut for wealthy savers as stealing (see 11.31am), Russia has signaled that it will support Cyprus by agreeing to relax the terms of its existing loan. President Vladimir Putin announced a little while ago that Russia will restructure the \u20ac2.5bn euro loan made to Cyprus in December 2011. Howard Amos has the details: \u201cIn light of the decision taken by the Eurogroup, President Putin considers it possible to support the efforts of the President of Cyprus, and also the European Commission, directed at overcoming the economic and systemic banking crisis of this island state,\u201d Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists, Interfax reported. Cypriot Finance Minister Michalis Sarris visited Moscow last week to seek financial support from the Kremlin, but was sent away apparently empty handed. A re-negotiation of the loan, including reducing the interest rate and extending its duration beyond 2016, was one of the items discussed. \u201cI think the loan will be extended and the conditions adjusted,\u201d Sarris said as he was leaving Moscow on Friday. The government has just announced that the Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades will make a televised statement at 7pm today (5pm GMT), with regard to the results of the Eurogroup meeting yesterday on Cyprus. The statement will be televised live by the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (Cybc). My colleague Helena Smith adds that the government has been arguing that it did the best it could: The Interior minister Sokratis Hasiko has said the banks will open in Cyprus tomorrow calling the deal \"the best solution possible.\" \"The no vote had its own negative effects and banks were put under pressure,\" he said this morning. \"We had got to the point where were discussing a haircut of between 50 and 60 percent ... so this is the best possible solution.\" Around 90% of readers fear that worse times are ahead for Cyprus, according to a poll launched this morning (which already has hundreds of votes). Vote here: Does the bailout deal mean the worst is over for Cyprus? - poll Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has accused Cypus of agreeing to \"steal\" from big deposit-holders at Laiki Bank and Bank of Cyprus. It's the first official signal of Moscow's displeasure. From the Russian capital, Howard Amos reports (and explains that Medvedev was channeling Lenin): Medvedev is the first Russian official to speak out about the Cyprus deal announced early this morning. \u201cThey are continuing to steal what has already been stolen,\u201d Medvedev told a government meeting, using a phrase Vladimir Lenin to answer the allegation that the Bolsheviks were thieves. Russian officials have repeatedly compared the Cypriot bank levy to Soviet-era expropriation. But he added the impact on Russian companies and Russian money was not yet fully clear. \u201cWe need to understand how this story will develop.\u201d Medvedev was an outspoken critic of the initial agreement between Cyprus and the troika of the European Commission, IMF and European Central Bank to levy a compulsory tax on deposits, describing the plan as \u201cabsurd\u201d last week and accusing the EU of behaving like \u201can elephant in a china shop.\u201d It's a bad deal -- although probably the best deal in the circumstances -- and Cyprus will probably need a second rescue package, says our economics editor, Larry Elliott. Larry writes: For a start, Cyprus faces a bleak economic future in which the need for a second bailout looks a strong probability. It is not just that the country's economic model has been destroyed. Nor is it simply that a brutal austerity programme is the condition for the \u20ac10bn loan. These will both hurt, but be compounded by a ferocious credit crunch as the banks seek to shore up their balance sheets by lending less and at higher rates of interest. The risk is of a full-scale economic collapse that will result in Cyprus having a debt problem worse than that in Greece. More here: Cyprus bailout: deeply flawed \u2013 but a best effort in desperate times The long lines that we've seen at Cyprus ATMs have dissipated this morning, now that regular Cypriots know they won't be immediately affected by the haircut agreed in Brussels. But from Limassol, my colleague Miriam Elder reports that people remain distressed by the situation: It's also a holiday here, but the mood is pretty grim. Cypriots realise that their economy will take a huge hit -- there are worries of long-term unemployment as big foreign investors are expected to seek ways to flee from the country. Anger remains directed at the EU, and Germany in particular. I talked to one woman who works at a hotel - she moved to Cyprus eight months ago to escape the financial crisis in Greece. \"We came here to find a better life, and it's exactly the same thing as in Greece. Everywhere I go there's crisis -- I'm telling all my friends that I'll go to Germany next,\" said Alexandra Salmani, 32. \"Someone has to learn to say no to Merkel. They saw a rich country, decided to take their money, and destroy them. They are not human.\" As I type, newsflashes from Berlin are coming in. Angela Merkel's spokesman is telling a press briefing that the Cypriot government must now explain to the people \"why this path is difficult but right\".... Here's video footage of last night's eurogroup press conference where the deal was announced (for anyone who had better things to do around 2am GMT) The Cyprus crisis has permanently changed the nature of the eurozone and and left small countries such as Luxembourg (which also has an out-sized financial sector) extremely jittery, says our Europe editor, Ian Traynor: The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has declared that the deal agreed in Brussels overnight is \"much better\" from a German point of view than the original plan. Speaking at a press conference in Berlin, Sch\u00e4uble said that Cyprus had finally recognised that large depositors must make a much larger contribution to the bailout: [Cypriot President] Anastasiades came to understand that it was not just Germany and the IMF that wanted a bail-in, but also the others. Here are more newswire snaps from Reuters: \u2022 GERMANY'S SCHAEUBLE SAYS CYPRUS DEAL IS \"FAIR\" FOR ALL INVOLVED \u2022 GERMANY'S SCHAEUBLE SAYS GOAL IS TO REDUCE CYPRIOT BANKING SECTOR TO EUROPEAN AVERAGE OF THREE-TIMES NATIONAL OUTPUT \u2022GERMANY'S SCHAEUBLE SAYS CYPRIOT BANKS SHOULD BE REOPENED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, TALKS ON THIS TO TAKE PLACE TODAY \u2022 GERMANY'S SCHAEUBLE SAYS GOAL IS TO COMPLETE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY APPROVALS OF CYPRUS DEAL IN THIRD WEEK OF APRIL Nicos Anastasiades, Cyprus's president, just issued a short statement thanking people for their support during yesterday's negotiations in Brussels: No mention of the reports that he threatened to resign during the negotiations... Michelle Caruso-Cabrera of CNBC has been taking a photo of the same ATM machine in Nicosia in recent today. This morning, it's pretty quiet. So, is this the end of Cyprus's problems? My colleague Josephine Moulds just put that question to bond analyst Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research, prompting a huge laugh from the other end of the phone. He said (once he'd recovered himself): In a way this is just the beginning of their problems. They\u2019ve stopped the old business model [attracting deposits from wealthy individuals] but it hasn't been replaced with anything else. He notes that the EU has made no economic projections for Cyprus, so has no idea how or when it will get its \u20ac10bn back from this country. They are never going to see that \u20ac10bn back. The economy is crushed for the next God knows how many years. As soon as people can take their money out the banks, they will take it out. If I've \u20ac10,000 in the Bank of Cyprus, why would I leave it there? Anyone\u2019s guess would be that the economy is going to crash in these circumstances. Confidence has disappeared. What is the impact on Cypriot companies? Has noone looked at how many corporates have over \u20ac100,000 in the bank? Who\u2019s going to want to do business with Cypriot corporates right now? Gary's conclusion... It\u2019s a nuclear bomb to crack a nut. If you\u2019re worried about money laundering go after money launderers. Don\u2019t go after Cypriot nationals. The deal will also have a major impact on banks in Spain and Italy, he says. If you\u2019re a US company, US politicians have been talking about how to get the money back from overseas. No non-Italian and non-Spanish companies are going to keep their money there. Similarly, he says, normal people banking in Spain and Italy will now likely pull their money out of the bank at the first sign of trouble, prompting disastrous bank runs. With regard to this subject I must say I have found some of the comments as to why this wouldn\u2019t happen interesting. Many have said how much better capitalised Italian and Spanish banks are, and how it is well known that the Cypriot banking system as a percentage of GDP was way bigger than other European countries. Quite right (although I have my doubts as to the real strength of many of these banks) but do they really think that the average person in the street has any interest about such statistics? In the event of a major problem do you think that people will say \u2018oh I will leave my money in the bank because their tier one ratio is 10% and as our banking system is nowhere near as big as the Cypriot one on a relative scale?\u2019 If they do they are likely to be crushed underfoot in the rush as others decide not to take any chances. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso looked satisfied, and tired, as the Eurozone meeting broke up early this morning: Joseph Cotterill of FT Alphaville has written the best detailed analysis of the Cyprus deal: Scratch one stupid idea [Updated]: Here are the key points (head over to AV for the full read (then come back!)) 1) In case you didn\u2019t get the memo the first time, this still isn\u2019t about spanking money-launderers. (because there's no differentiation between foreign and domestic customers with over \u20ac100k) 2) It\u2019s a depositor bail-in \u2014 for two specific banks, one of which is in full resolution. (rather than forcing all customers at all banks to contribute, as in the first - hated - bailout plan) 3) It\u2019s also a senior bank bond bail-in. (Holders of Laiki\u2019s senior unsecured debt look fully wiped out - those at Bank of Cyprus will take a brisk haircut) 4) Emergency Liquidity Assistance. -- Was this the week we found out that ELA will be protected from default no matter what? (under the deal, the assistance supplied by the European Central Bank to Laiki is now transferred to Bank of Cyprus) * * * * * * And over at Reuters, Felix Salmon points out that the winding-down of Laiki is a rather big deal for a rather small country: The resolution of Laiki is going to give the world a very real example of what happens when a too-big-to-fail bank is allowed to fail. Laiki is small by global standards, but very large by comparison with Cyprus\u2019s GDP. If Cyprus can survive Laiki\u2019s collapse, then maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 the world could cope with the \u201cresolution\u201d of a big bank like Citigroup. But that\u2019s a very big \u201cif\u201d. More likely, the costs to Cyprus of allowing Laiki to fail will be enormous, both politically and economically. And 800,000 Cypriots will for years to come be paying the price of what Mohamed El-Erian elegantly calls \u201cbailout fatigue\u201d. More here: Cyprus: It\u2019s not over yet There's no sign of celebration in Cyprus this morning, as people digest the news that the bailout has been secured in return for the downsizing of its banking system and heavy losses for wealthy savers: Just in: Depositors in Bank of Cyprus with over \u20ac100,000 are likely to lose 30% on their holdings, the chairman of the island's parliamentary finance committee has predicted. Nicholas Papadopoulos made the prediction to Irish radio this morning, saying: I haven't heard a formal announcement about the haircut, but this is the figure I heard. No update on the position for big depositors at Laiki -- but clearly they'll lose more than the crowd at BoC, and they could lose the lot (over \u20ac100k). European markets have risen in early trading as investors react to the news from Brussels. FTSE 100: up 40 points at 6432, + 0.6% German DAX: up 77 points at 7989, +1% French CAC: up 53 points at 3823, + 1.5% Italian FTSE MIB: up 121 points at 16166, + 0.75% Spanish IBEX: up 79 points at 8403, +0.89% And in Asia, the Japanese Nikkei finished 1.7% higher. The euro, though, is bobbing around $1.30 -- just 0.1 cents higher than on Friday night. Not exactly a monster rally.... The deal won't prevent tough capital controls being imposed on Cypriots. We saw an early taste of it yesterday, when ATM cash withdrawal limits were cut to \u20ac100 per day The controls will also make it hard, or impossible, to transfer money between accounts or out of the country - to avoid a bank run draining the country's remaining banks. During this morning's press conference, EC commissioner Olli Rehn said he hoped Cyprus would be able to raise them soon, but the reality could be months of restrictions. Full details of the Cyprus deal are still emerging this morning, but the top line is that wealthy depositors are being hit much harder than in the original plan. Here's what we understand: \u2022 All deposits under \u20ac100k have been protected. \u2022 Laiki Bank (or Popular Bank) will be wound down and split into a 'good' and 'bad' bank. Thousands of jobs are likely to be lost. \u2022 The 'good' bit of Laiki (smaller savers) will being moulded into Bank of Cyprus. \u2022 The bad bit, containing its uninsured deposits and toxic assets, will be wound down over time. \u2022 Those with savings over \u20ac100,000 at Laiki, along with bond holders and shareholders, will all make a \"full contribution\" to the restructuring. That is being taken as a signal that wealthy depositors could be wiped out completely - but the full picture may take a while to emerge. As Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research put it: Whilst there was no official confirmation I assume that deposit holders over \u20ac100k in Laiki Bank will be totally wiped out, but that is just an assumption from the language used. \u2022 Uninsured deposits (\u20ac100k and above) in Bank of Cyprus will be frozen, and remain suspended until the bank has been recapitalised. It's not clear what haircut they will suffer -- there was talk of 40% plus in Brussels last night. You can read the statement released by the eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) here. if you missed Sunday's bailout drama, you can relive all the excitement in yesterday's Cyprus crisis liveblog: Cyprus bailout: last-ditch deal agreed - as it happened Highlights of the press conference start at 1.30am (it's been quite a night) Good morning. Cyprus has struck a last-gasp draft deal with its international lenders overnight which should mean it secures its desperately needed \u20ac10bn bailout and avoids crashing out of the eurozone. In return for the aid, the Cyprus government has committed to imposing very heavy losses on depositors with over \u20ac100,000 in the bank. Its second-largest bank, Laiki, will be shut down while the country's largest lender, Bank of Cyprus, is being heavily restructured. The agreement was hammered out after a classic marathon session of talks in Brussels from Sunday lunchtime, in which Cyprus's president Nicos Anastasiades reportedly threatened to resign rather than accept the terms demanded by the country's lenders. But a deal was finally put together out, culminating in a press conference at 1.30am GMT. There was relief in Brussels early this morning, but Cyprus still faces a troubled future, with its banks remaining closed today. Cyprus' finance minister Michalis Sarris told reporters: It's not that we won a battle, but we really have avoided a disastrous exit from the eurozone. The deal should mean that the European Central Bank lifts its threat to withdraw liquidity from the Cypriot banking sector. It also appears that the deal will not need the approval of the Cypriot parliament. But many questions remain: how will the Russians react? Will the deal be acceptable in Cyprus?... ....And just how much damage has the chaos and confusion of the last week caused to Cyprus, and the rest of the eurozone? We'll be tracking all the developments throughout the day.",

    "webTitle": "Cold weather makes triple-dip recession more likely, economists fear", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears that Britain is heading for an unprecedented triple-dip recession have intensified as economists warned that the severe weather gripping much of Britain threatened a second successive quarter of falling national output. Just days after the chancellor predicted that the UK would narrowly avoid a second successive quarter of negative growth \u2013 the official definition of recession \u2013 experts warned that the combination of heavy snow and sub-zero temperatures might be a crucial factor in whether the economy expanded in the first three months of 2013. Osborne has been hoping that a pick-up in the housing market and stronger consumer spending will be enough to eke out growth of 0.1% in the three months to March, avoiding \"triple dip\" headlines when the official figures are released late next month. But amid reports of empty shopping malls, closed schools and factory shutdowns, analysts said the weather increased the chance that the fall in activity in the final three months of 2012 would be followed by another quarter of falling gross domestic product in early 2013 \u2013 thus satisfying the official definition of a recession. Economists said the cold snap would affect takings at pubs and restaurants, while parents would have had to take time off work to look after their children when the schools were closed. Manufacturing firms were likely to be affected by disrupted supply chains. Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, said that the disruption was likely to be smaller than in December 2010, when blizzards contributed to a 0.5% drop in quarterly output. \"Nonetheless, given that most economic indicators suggest that the economy was barely growing at all before the latest bad weather struck, the snow could well be enough to cause GDP to fall for a second consecutive quarter.\" He added that experience showed that spending in the high street would be around 1% lower this month as a result of the temperature in March being 3C below the average for the time of year. The construction industry would also be affected, while blocked roads and cancelled trains would make it harder for people to get to work. In the past, much of the output lost as a result of bad weather has been recouped in later months. But Tombs said news of a triple-dip downturn would \"probably still depress consumer confidence and lead to more calls for the government to reassess its austere spending plans\". The City is already braced for a weak growth figure following the halving to just 0.6% of the government's growth forecast for 2013. Britain is currently experiencing the slowest recovery in the past 100 years, following the deep downturn of 2008-09 and a second, shallower recession in 2011-12. There has been no triple-dip recession since modern records began. Growth in the first quarter of 2013 has already been disrupted by poor weather in January, although the strong data for retail sales in February suggests that parts of the economy quickly bounced back. Analysts said, however, that the timing of the latest weather disruption made it impossible for the reduction in output to be recouped in the current quarter. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Bad weather is always unwelcome news for the UK economy, and the latest bout is particularly bad timing as it is battling to avoid further contraction in the first quarter of 2013 and dodge a triple-dip recession. Just how much the economy is affected by the latest snow will obviously depend on how widespread it ends up being and how long difficult travelling conditions last. \"But the worry is with it looking touch and go whether the economy can avoid further contraction in the first quarter and hence formally suffer triple-dip recession, even a slight hit to activity from the bad weather could be the deciding factor that tips the balance towards a further drop in GDP.\"",

      "body": "<p>Fears that Britain is heading for an unprecedented triple-dip recession have intensified as economists warned that the severe weather gripping much of Britain threatened a second successive quarter of falling national output.</p> <p>Just days after the chancellor predicted that the UK would narrowly avoid a second successive quarter of negative growth \u2013 the official definition of recession \u2013 experts warned that the combination of heavy snow and sub-zero temperatures might be a crucial factor in whether the economy expanded in the first three months of 2013.</p> <p>Osborne has been hoping that a pick-up in the housing market and stronger consumer spending will be enough to eke out growth of 0.1% in the three months to March, avoiding \"triple dip\" headlines when the official figures are released late next month.</p> <p>But amid reports of empty shopping malls, closed schools and factory shutdowns, analysts said the weather increased the chance that the fall in activity in the final three months of 2012 would be followed by another quarter of falling gross domestic product in early 2013 \u2013 thus satisfying the official definition of a recession.</p> <p>Economists said the cold snap would affect takings at pubs and restaurants, while parents would have had to take time off work to look after their children when the schools were closed. Manufacturing firms were likely to be affected by disrupted supply chains.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, said that the disruption was likely to be smaller than in December 2010, when blizzards contributed to a 0.5% drop in quarterly output. \"Nonetheless, given that most economic indicators suggest that the economy was barely growing at all before the latest bad weather struck, the snow could well be enough to cause GDP to fall for a second consecutive quarter.\"</p> <p>He added that experience showed that spending in the high street would be around 1% lower this month as a result of the temperature in March being 3C below the average for the time of year. The construction industry would also be affected, while blocked roads and cancelled trains would make it harder for people to get to work.</p> <p>In the past, much of the output lost as a result of bad weather has been recouped in later months. But Tombs said news of a triple-dip downturn would \"probably still depress consumer confidence and lead to more calls for the government to reassess its austere spending plans\".</p> <p>The City is already braced for a weak growth figure following the halving to just 0.6% of the government's growth forecast for 2013. Britain is currently experiencing the slowest recovery in the past 100 years, following the deep downturn of 2008-09 and a second, shallower recession in 2011-12. There has been no triple-dip recession since modern records began.</p> <p>Growth in the first quarter of 2013 has already been disrupted by poor weather in January, although the strong data for retail sales in February suggests that parts of the economy quickly bounced back. Analysts said, however, that the timing of the latest weather disruption made it impossible for the reduction in output to be recouped in the current quarter.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Bad weather is always unwelcome news for the UK economy, and the latest bout is particularly bad timing as it is battling to avoid further contraction in the first quarter of 2013 and dodge a triple-dip recession. Just how much the economy is affected by the latest snow will obviously depend on how widespread it ends up being and how long difficult travelling conditions last.</p> <p>\"But the worry is with it looking touch and go whether the economy can avoid further contraction in the first quarter and hence formally suffer triple-dip recession, even a slight hit to activity from the bad weather could be the deciding factor that tips the balance towards a further drop in GDP.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Britain's new financial watchdog has pledged to clean up the financial services sector by using new powers to suspend or ban products if they appear harmful to consumers.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which takes over from the Financial Services Authority next week, laid out plans to protect consumers and maintain market \"cleanliness\" where financial products are \"inherently flawed\" or are \"in serious danger of of being sold to the wrong customers\". Until now, the regulator has examined the sales and marketing of products, but not their design.</p> <p>Ten years after the regulator was first warned about problems with payment protection insurance, consumer groups said a clampdown on the sale of dodgy financial products was long overdue.</p> <p>Sales of PPI policies were allowed to continue unchecked for years while the regulator conducted an in-depth review. Thousands of policies were sold despite a wave of complaints from customers who were charged sky-high rates and then told that they were unable to make a claim.</p> <p>Eventually the regulator ruled that it breached City regulations.

      "bodyText": "Britain's new financial watchdog has pledged to clean up the financial services sector by using new powers to suspend or ban products if they appear harmful to consumers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which takes over from the Financial Services Authority next week, laid out plans to protect consumers and maintain market \"cleanliness\" where financial products are \"inherently flawed\" or are \"in serious danger of of being sold to the wrong customers\". Until now, the regulator has examined the sales and marketing of products, but not their design. Ten years after the regulator was first warned about problems with payment protection insurance, consumer groups said a clampdown on the sale of dodgy financial products was long overdue. Sales of PPI policies were allowed to continue unchecked for years while the regulator conducted an in-depth review. Thousands of policies were sold despite a wave of complaints from customers who were charged sky-high rates and then told that they were unable to make a claim. Eventually the regulator ruled that it breached City regulations. PPI has since cost the banks more than \u00a312bn in compensation. However, the controversial move by the new watchdog is expected to spark opposition from banks and insurers, which fear that consumer groups will pressure the watchdog to block the sales of highly profitable products. Martin Wheatley, chief executive designate of the FCA, said: \"The creation of the FCA is our opportunity to reset conduct standards. This power, along with our other new powers, helps define how we will regulate. \"We know that some in the industry are concerned about us using this power too hastily; I want to be clear that we know proportionate judgment is needed, and that is what we will exercise. I do not expect us to use this power frequently, but both industry and consumers need to be clear that we will not hesitate to use these powers where we have serious concerns.\" Some of the instances in which the FCA might consider suspending the sale of a product include: \u2022 where a product is in serious danger of being sold to the wrong customers, for instance where complex or niche products are sold to the mass market; \u2022 where a non-essential feature of a product seems to be causing serious problems for consumers; and \u2022 where a product is inherently flawed. The FCA will take over responsibility for consumer protection covering 26,000 financial services companies, while the Prudential Regulatory Authority, which will be part of the Bank of England, takes over the FSA's role monitoring the systemic risks posed by major banks and insurers. The resources needed to support the FCA's expanded role will be a larger burden on the industry, according to the organisation's budget. It will have a budget of \u00a3432m and 2,800 staff, compared with the 2012-13 budget of \u00a3578m and roughly 4,000 people for the FSA. The PRA, the regulator focused on financial stability, will have 1,300 staff supervising 1,400 banks and insurers, but has not yet announced its budget.",

Its \u20ac4.2bn in deposits over \u20ac100,000 will be placed in a \"bad bank\", meaning they could be wiped out entirely. Those with smaller deposits at Laiki will see their accounts transferred to the Bank of Cyprus.</p> <p>All lenders to Laiki will see their investments wiped out, in a first for a eurozone bailout. In other bailouts, holders of higher-rated bonds have not faced such losses.</p> <p>\u2022 Bank of Cyprus survives the axe, but faces huge restructuring. No bailout money will be used to recapitalise the bank. Instead its shareholders and bondholders will be hit. It is thought depositors with over \u20ac100,000 at the bank will also be involved in the recapitalisation and face losses of around 30%.</p> <p>Getting the bank up to healthy EU-mandated capital levels will be made harder by the fact that Bank of Cyprus will inherit a \u20ac9bn debt Laiki had with the European Central Bank.</p> <p><strong>Is my money safe in a UK branch of Laiki Bank?</strong></p> <p>The bank is saying it is \"business as usual\" for individuals and companies with money in its four UK branches.</p> <p>It says its customers will not be transferred to Bank of Cyprus, even though it set up as a branch rather than a subsidiary. It is not restricting withdrawals and says customers should not panic.</p> <p><strong>But what if the bank had to close?</strong></p> <p>Customers are covered by the Cyprus deposit protection scheme up to \u20ac100,000. Laiki Bank UK is in talks with the Bank of England and Financial Services Authority about the status of savers with more.</p> <p><strong>What about Bank of Cyprus customers in the UK?</strong></p> <p>Bank of Cyprus's UK operation is a separate entity, incorporated in the UK, so customers are unaffected by any of the arrangements made in Cyprus. Customers are covered by the UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme, so if anything did get wrong they would get the first \u00a385,000 of their holdings returned, possibly within days.</p> <p><strong>How does the deal differ from the one on the table last week? </strong></p> <p>Two key differences: first, small depositors have been protected \u2013 with the EU's \u20ac100,000 legal guarantee upheld. Second, the plan does not have to be approved by the Cypriot parliament because losses on large depositors will be achieved by restructuring Cyprus's two largest banks and not by levying a \"tax\" on its citizens.</p> <p><strong>Who are the biggest losers?</strong></p> <p>Russian nationals are estimated to hold more than \u20ac20bn of the \u20ac68bn deposited in Cypriot banks and many have deposits over \u20ac100,000.</p> <p>Laiki Bank was 84% owned by the Cypriot government, following a \u20ac1.8bn bailout in June last year. The rest is owned by private and institutional investors, including bank staff.</p> <p>Laiki bondholders will be wiped out and lenders to the Bank of Cyprus will face heavy losses in the recapitalisation.</p> <p>Thousands of staff at both Laiki and the Bank of Cyprus will lose their jobs.</p> <p><strong>What will happen when the banks open in Cyprus?</strong></p> <p>There will still be very tough restrictions on bank account access and the movement of cash out of Cyprus, to help prevent a bank run. The European commission said these capital controls will only be enacted \"exceptionally and temporarily\", as requested by the Cypriot authorities.</p> <p>The fear is that Cypriot savers will be sufficiently worried by the past week's events that, when they are finally allowed to, they will take their money out regardless of the guarantee that deposits up to \u20ac100,000 are safe.</p> <p><strong>Will this be the end of Cyprus's problems?</strong></p> <p>No. In fact, analysts say it is only the beginning. Cyprus has benefited for years from attracting the deposits of wealthy individuals from around the eurozone. That business model is now broken and the country has nothing to replace it with. Tellingly, the EU gave no economic projections for Cyprus in its statement.</p> <p>Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research said: \"The economy is crushed for the next God knows how many years. As soon as people can take their money out the banks, they will take it out. Confidence has disappeared. Who's going to want to do business with Cypriot corporates right now?\"</p> <p><strong>Will Cyprus need another bailout?</strong></p> <p>Possibly. The \u20ac10bn bailout raises Cyprus's debt to around 143% of GDP. With GDP likely to fall dramatically over the next few years, that ratio could start to look even more perilous.</p> <p>A deal to restructure Cyprus's debt by hitting private bondholders would go against EU promises that the Greek deal of that kind was an exception.</p> <p>All of which prompts analysts at UBS to suggest Cyprus's eurozone partners might have to get involved again some time in the future. They write: \"In other words, we see a risk that this bailout for Cyprus might not have been the last one.\"</p> <p><strong>Will this be the model for future bailouts?</strong></p> <p>It is impossible to say. So far, no two eurozone bailouts have been the same. Policymakers appear to react to events, rather than follow a fixed plan. The danger is that no one is paying attention to the unintended consequences.</p> <p><strong>What could the unintended consequences of this particular plan be?</strong></p> <p>With their initial plan to tax all depositors, policymakers made it clear that they would, in certain circumstances, be prepared to take that money. Even though they did not go through with it, this will likely shake confidence in the banks if the financial crisis re-escalates in other countries, such as Spain or Italy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, larger depositors and foreign companies with money in Spain and Italy are likely to start shifting that elsewhere, fearing that the Cyprus deal will be a model for future bailouts, further damaging already weak financial institutions.</p>",

In other bailouts, holders of higher-rated bonds have not faced such losses. \u2022 Bank of Cyprus survives the axe, but faces huge restructuring. No bailout money will be used to recapitalise the bank. Instead its shareholders and bondholders will be hit. It is thought depositors with over \u20ac100,000 at the bank will also be involved in the recapitalisation and face losses of around 30%. Getting the bank up to healthy EU-mandated capital levels will be made harder by the fact that Bank of Cyprus will inherit a \u20ac9bn debt Laiki had with the European Central Bank. Is my money safe in a UK branch of Laiki Bank? The bank is saying it is \"business as usual\" for individuals and companies with money in its four UK branches. It says its customers will not be transferred to Bank of Cyprus, even though it set up as a branch rather than a subsidiary. It is not restricting withdrawals and says customers should not panic. But what if the bank had to close? Customers are covered by the Cyprus deposit protection scheme up to \u20ac100,000. Laiki Bank UK is in talks with the Bank of England and Financial Services Authority about the status of savers with more. What about Bank of Cyprus customers in the UK? Bank of Cyprus's UK operation is a separate entity, incorporated in the UK, so customers are unaffected by any of the arrangements made in Cyprus. Customers are covered by the UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme, so if anything did get wrong they would get the first \u00a385,000 of their holdings returned, possibly within days. How does the deal differ from the one on the table last week? Two key differences: first, small depositors have been protected \u2013 with the EU's \u20ac100,000 legal guarantee upheld. Second, the plan does not have to be approved by the Cypriot parliament because losses on large depositors will be achieved by restructuring Cyprus's two largest banks and not by levying a \"tax\" on its citizens. Who are the biggest losers? Russian nationals are estimated to hold more than \u20ac20bn of the \u20ac68bn deposited in Cypriot banks and many have deposits over \u20ac100,000. Laiki Bank was 84% owned by the Cypriot government, following a \u20ac1.8bn bailout in June last year. The rest is owned by private and institutional investors, including bank staff. Laiki bondholders will be wiped out and lenders to the Bank of Cyprus will face heavy losses in the recapitalisation. Thousands of staff at both Laiki and the Bank of Cyprus will lose their jobs. What will happen when the banks open in Cyprus? There will still be very tough restrictions on bank account access and the movement of cash out of Cyprus, to help prevent a bank run. The European commission said these capital controls will only be enacted \"exceptionally and temporarily\", as requested by the Cypriot authorities. The fear is that Cypriot savers will be sufficiently worried by the past week's events that, when they are finally allowed to, they will take their money out regardless of the guarantee that deposits up to \u20ac100,000 are safe. Will this be the end of Cyprus's problems? No. In fact, analysts say it is only the beginning. Cyprus has benefited for years from attracting the deposits of wealthy individuals from around the eurozone. That business model is now broken and the country has nothing to replace it with. Tellingly, the EU gave no economic projections for Cyprus in its statement. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research said: \"The economy is crushed for the next God knows how many years. As soon as people can take their money out the banks, they will take it out. Confidence has disappeared. Who's going to want to do business with Cypriot corporates right now?\" Will Cyprus need another bailout? Possibly. The \u20ac10bn bailout raises Cyprus's debt to around 143% of GDP. With GDP likely to fall dramatically over the next few years, that ratio could start to look even more perilous. A deal to restructure Cyprus's debt by hitting private bondholders would go against EU promises that the Greek deal of that kind was an exception. All of which prompts analysts at UBS to suggest Cyprus's eurozone partners might have to get involved again some time in the future. They write: \"In other words, we see a risk that this bailout for Cyprus might not have been the last one.\" Will this be the model for future bailouts? It is impossible to say. So far, no two eurozone bailouts have been the same. Policymakers appear to react to events, rather than follow a fixed plan. The danger is that no one is paying attention to the unintended consequences. What could the unintended consequences of this particular plan be? With their initial plan to tax all depositors, policymakers made it clear that they would, in certain circumstances, be prepared to take that money. Even though they did not go through with it, this will likely shake confidence in the banks if the financial crisis re-escalates in other countries, such as Spain or Italy. Meanwhile, larger depositors and foreign companies with money in Spain and Italy are likely to start shifting that elsewhere, fearing that the Cyprus deal will be a model for future bailouts, further damaging already weak financial institutions.",

No formal first quarter trading update is due, but \"the weather\" will be on everyone's minds, given the dreadfully cold start to spring in the UK (it probably hasn't been much better in France or Poland) and, although B&amp;Q is due a decent summer after last year's wash-out, Kingfisher will need to think about a scenario where the weather is simply never right for outdoor and seasonal DIY and we hope to hear about plans to downside the UK store portfolio. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Drax</strong> dropped 12p to 615p.

      "bodyText": "European leaders reached an agreement with Cyprus early on Monday morning that closes down the island's second-largest bank and inflicts huge losses on wealthy savers.

Laiki, or Cyprus Popular Bank, is to be closed. Its \u20ac4.2bn in deposits over \u20ac100,000 will be placed in a \"bad bank\" and could be wiped out entirely.

The Cypriot government reportedly fought hard for Bank of Cyprus to be spared, but the island's biggest bank will face huge restructuring.

It is thought depositors with more than \u20ac100,000 at the bank will also be involved in the recapitalisation, and are expected to face losses of around 30%. Getting the bank up to healthy EU-mandated capital levels will be made harder by the fact that Bank of Cyprus will inherit a \u20ac9bn debt Laiki had with the European Central Bank (ECB). The bailout deal does not need approval from the Cypriot parliament because it has been achieved by restructuring the country's two largest banks, rather than levying a new tax on citizens. Negotiations got under way on Sunday amid a hardening of stance by the IMF and Germany, which insisted that depositors must take the hit for bailing out the eurozone's latest crisis economy. Reports suggest that Anastasiades threatened to resign amid demands for a deep restructuring of Cyprus's banking system, but he remained in his post on Monday morning: \"I'm happy because we shall have a programme and it's in the best interests of the Cyprus people and the European Union,\" he said, on leaving the building in Brussels where talks were held. The ECB had threatened to cut off funds propping up Cypriot banks on Monday, which would have precipitated the island's exit from the euro if the emergency meeting had not reached an agreement. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany's finance minister, said the deal agreed in Brussels overnight is \"much better\" from a German point of view than the original plan. He said the goal was to shrink the Cypriot banking sector to the European average of three-times national output, rather than its current size of seven times. Cyprus had hoped to secure a rescue package from Russia, but the government was forced into fresh negotiations with its troika of lenders \u2013 the EU, the IMF and the ECB \u2013 after the Cypriot finance minister, Michalis Sarris, returned empty-handed from two days of talks in Moscow last week. The new bailout deal will hit foreign investors, particularly Russians, hard. Russian nationals are estimated to hold more than \u20ac20bn of the \u20ac68bn deposited in Cypriot banks. Russia's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said on Monday: \"They are continuing to steal what has already been stolen,\" using a phrase Vladimir Lenin used to answer the allegation that the Bolsheviks were thieves. Russian officials have repeatedly compared the Cypriot bank levy to Soviet-era expropriation. There were signs of panic over the weekend as a \u20ac100 limit was imposed on ATM withdrawals in Cyprus.

Going by what's being briefed tonight, the agreement is substantively the same as that demanded by the Troika last week.</p> <p>Perhaps a few variables have been changed (such as the protection of smaller savers' deposits), but not enough.</p> <p>And if you look at what's happened to leaders of other peripheral euro countries who've accepted the Troika's structural-adjustment programmes, they've nearly all been toast. The one major exception i can think of is Madrid's Rajoy, who Brussels kindly allowed to do a bit of face-saving.</p> <p>As for the troika, Oli Rehn et al will be able to claim that at least they avoided the doomsday scenario of pulling the plug on the Cypriot banking sector -- with all the turbulence that might entail. And, going by the placidity of continental markets over the past week, they'll also be entitled to say that they have convinced investors that Cyprus was a tiny economic anomaly rather than the rule.</p> <p>But again, we've had the farce of eleventh-hour negotiations where it looked for a bit as if the fate of a 17-member currency area hung in the balance.</p> <p>We now have capital controls in an economic area, one of whose main purposes is to facilitate the free flow of capital; I speak as someone who sees a place for capital controls, but some financiers will see that as a dangerous precedent.</p> <p>While we're talking about precedents, here are two more:</p> <p>1. You've been treated to the unlovely sight of the Troika and Nicosia apparently agreeing to raid the life savings of small savers. Anyone living in another small, weak, euro member state should take note.</p> <p>2 And you've also had a euro member turning away from its 16 fellow members and towards a non-EU country for help and political support. Just imagine if Cyprus had been dealing with a serious partner, rather than Russia?</p> <p>So yes, the euro-juggernaut rolls on, even while half an island worth<br> 0,2% of its GDP falls off.</p> <p>Cyprus faces a Greek-style depression, the crushing of its national business model (the hot money's already fled to Latvia; and now it won't be coming) and, I'll bet, more dollops of austerity. But the euro project has once again been shown to have some serious structural and institutional problems.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-25T01:17:43.148Z\">at 1.17am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-514f9e1bb5795d794abf43f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-25T00:45:15.143Z\">12.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The explosion earlier in&#xa0;Limassol appears to have been quite a small incident, according to Cyprus' state-run news agency.</p> <p>Quoting anonymous police sources, the Cyprus News Agency said it caused some damage to the branch in a suburb of the and that the scene has been cordoned off.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-03-25T00:53:56.062Z\">at 12.53am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-514f9919b5795d794abf43f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-25T00:23:53.376Z\">12.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The euro and Asian shares have been rising in the wake of suggestions from EU sources that a rescue deal to avoid Cypriot financial meltdown is taking shape.</p> <p>In Japan, Reuters quotes Yuji Saito, director of foreign exchange at Credit Agricole in Tokyo:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The news was what markets were waiting for, some kind of an agreement.

      "bodyText": "A Russian jouranlist asks: do you expect Cyprus will come back to negotiations with Russia? Djisselbloem says he is \"sure\" that the Cypriot government will continue with the talks, \"especially on the loan\" and we hope for a contribution to the total package. Answering a follow-up question, and in comments that are likely raise more than a few eyebrows, the Eurogroup chief insists that there has been \"no return of the Eurozone crisis\". He also stresses that it is important to recognise that there has been no bank run. Of course, it remains to be seen what happens in the coming days when the Cypriot banks finally open again. And on that note we are wrapping up the blog. Join us again in the morning for continuing coverage of the \"non-crisis\". Has the credibility of the European political project been undermined by what has happened over the last week? Dijsselbloem responds by saying that the urgency for having a banking union has only increased \"It's motivating to push along,\" he adds. Back at the press conference and Olli Rehn wouldn't be drawn on reports that the Cypriot President, Nicos Anastasiades, had threatened to resign. Some tired laughter also from the audience of journalists to Rehn's comments that his wife now complains that he is spending more time with Christine Lagarde than her. Meanwhile, in answer to other questions: The full Eurogroup statement on Cyprus can be viewed here. It says that the Eurogroup has reached an agreement with the Cypriot authorities on the key elements necessary for a future macroeconomic adjustment programme. It adds: The programme will address the exceptional challenges that Cyprus is facing and restore the viability of the financial sector, with the view of restoring sustainable growth and sound public finances over the coming years. The statement adds: The programme will contain a decisive approach to addressing financial sector imbalances. There will be an appropriate downsizing of the financial sector, with the domestic banking sector reaching the EU average by 2018. In addition, the Cypriot authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to step up efforts in the areas of fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and privatisation. It concludes by saying that the Eurogroup expects that the ESM Board of Governors will be in a position to formally approve the proposal for a financial assistance facility agreement by the third week of April 2013 subject to the completion of national procedures. The panel is asked: How many companies are likely to go bankrupt as a result of closing one bank? Dijsselbloem says that Laiki bank simply cannot be saved and it is important to ensure that it is an orderly process and that insured depositors are protected. \"For the Bank of Cyprus all the calculations will be done and we will ensure that it will become once again a bank that can finance the economy of Cyprus and finance companies in Cyprus,\" he adds. The \"carving out\" of the Greek branches of the Cypriuot banks will also have to be calculated, says Dijsselbloem. Then the size of a haircut will be be assessed. Rehn is addressing Cyprus' growth outlook now and says that the macro-economic projections for the country will be assessed in the coming weeks. \"This work will be done in the coming weeks and by mid April a memorandum is expected to be concluded,\" he adds. Dijsselbloem says he is convinced that tonight's \"solution\" is better than last week because it is concentrated on the country's two major banks. IMF chief Christine Lagarde is speaking now and says that she believes that a \"lasting, durable and fully financed solution\" has been identified. She expects to be in a position to make a recommendation to the IMF executive board in the coming weeks aimed at including the financial participation of the IMF in the package. The EU's economic affairs chief Olli Rehn is speaking now, and slightly overdoses on the Beatles references. \"It has been another hard day's night,\" he says, adding that he won't say it is \"a long and winding road\". The near future will be very difficult for Cyprus and its people but the commission will do its best to alleviate the shock. A Commission taskforce will be created in agreement with the government, which will provide technical assistance to the authorities with a strong focus on employment and growth. \"It will be necessary for the Cypriot people to rebuild their economy on a new basis,\" he adds. The language is almost as if Cyprus has just come out the other end of a war, a notion underlined by further comments from Rehn. \"Cyprus and the Cypriot people have gone through very tough times and you know what I mean.\" A press conference is under way now with eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem taking the lead. \"I would l like to emphasis that none of these measures will affect desposits below \u20ac100,000,\" he says. The package, he says, will allow a normally functioning and stable environment to be be achieved very soon in Cyprus. Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has popped up, with some comments that are unlikely to go down well among many Cypriots. Bloomberg News has some of his remarks tonight: So here's a wrap-up of what appears to be the shape of tonight's last-ditch deal between Cyprus and international lenders: \u2022 A \u20ac10bn bailout that will shut down Cyprus' second largest bank and inflict heavy losses on uninsured depositors, including wealthy Russians. \u2022 The deal will spare the country a financial meltdown by winding down Popular Bank of Cyprus, also known as Laiki, and shifting deposits below \u20ac100,000 to the Bank of Cyprus to create a \"good bank\". \u2022 Deposits above \u20ac100,000, which under EU law are not guaranteed, will be frozen and used to resolve debts, and Laiki will effectively be shuttered, with thousands of job losses. President Anastasiades of Cyprus has reportedly been making some public comments on the package. It's short (and sweet?) thus far: We have a deal that's in the interests of the Cypriot people and the EU. The new rescue plan for Cyprus and its shattered banks has been rubberstamped by eurozone finance ministers, according to Luke Baker, the Reuters bureau chief in Brussels: The Guardian's economics leader writer, Aditya Chakrabortty, has been mulling over the implications of the suggested deal in political-economic terms, and he reckons it's pretty damaging for both sides: In Cyprus, President Nicos Anastasiades, who has been in the job for less than a month, looks like a dead man walking. Going by what's being briefed tonight, the agreement is substantively the same as that demanded by the Troika last week. Perhaps a few variables have been changed (such as the protection of smaller savers' deposits), but not enough. And if you look at what's happened to leaders of other peripheral euro countries who've accepted the Troika's structural-adjustment programmes, they've nearly all been toast. The one major exception i can think of is Madrid's Rajoy, who Brussels kindly allowed to do a bit of face-saving. As for the troika, Oli Rehn et al will be able to claim that at least they avoided the doomsday scenario of pulling the plug on the Cypriot banking sector -- with all the turbulence that might entail. And, going by the placidity of continental markets over the past week, they'll also be entitled to say that they have convinced investors that Cyprus was a tiny economic anomaly rather than the rule. But again, we've had the farce of eleventh-hour negotiations where it looked for a bit as if the fate of a 17-member currency area hung in the balance. We now have capital controls in an economic area, one of whose main purposes is to facilitate the free flow of capital; I speak as someone who sees a place for capital controls, but some financiers will see that as a dangerous precedent. While we're talking about precedents, here are two more: 1. You've been treated to the unlovely sight of the Troika and Nicosia apparently agreeing to raid the life savings of small savers. Anyone living in another small, weak, euro member state should take note. 2 And you've also had a euro member turning away from its 16 fellow members and towards a non-EU country for help and political support. Just imagine if Cyprus had been dealing with a serious partner, rather than Russia? So yes, the euro-juggernaut rolls on, even while half an island worth 0,2% of its GDP falls off. Cyprus faces a Greek-style depression, the crushing of its national business model (the hot money's already fled to Latvia; and now it won't be coming) and, I'll bet, more dollops of austerity. But the euro project has once again been shown to have some serious structural and institutional problems. The explosion earlier in Limassol appears to have been quite a small incident, according to Cyprus' state-run news agency. Quoting anonymous police sources, the Cyprus News Agency said it caused some damage to the branch in a suburb of the and that the scene has been cordoned off. The euro and Asian shares have been rising in the wake of suggestions from EU sources that a rescue deal to avoid Cypriot financial meltdown is taking shape. In Japan, Reuters quotes Yuji Saito, director of foreign exchange at Credit Agricole in Tokyo: The news was what markets were waiting for, some kind of an agreement. But uncertainties remain as it is still subject to further discussions. Of course, failure to clinch a deal could yet cause a wider financial market sell-off, but some analysts say contagion would be limited given that Cyprus accounts for just 0.2% of the eurozone's economic output. Another Reuters quote, from Greg Gibbs, senior currency strategist at RBS in Singapore: We might get a small relief rally if we do get one, but markets will then very quickly turn to the risk of a bank run and whether conditions for the aid will be implemented smoothly. So, on the basis of what is filtering through tonight, it's good news for smaller deposit holders in Cyprus, or at least anyone with less than \u20ac100,000. It looks like they won't be subject to a levy. Large deposit holders appear to be looking at a 40% hit however, according to the BBC's Christian Fraser. Effectively, it's a return to the deal that Germany and the IMF were advocating last week. What will the Russians make of this on Monday morning (as well as the folks in the picture below)? Meanwhile, a cautionary note: More from Ian Traynor in Brussels now: As more details of a possible deal in Brussels come through, the Greek daily Kathimerini reports that ehe hold-up in tonight's negotiations was caused by differences between Nicosia and the IMF over the potential merger of Cyprus Popular Bank (Laiki) and Bank of Cyprus. It adds: The IMF and Germany insist that after being split into a good and bad bank, \u201cgood\u201d Laiki should be merged with Bank of Cyprus and the new lender should then assume liability for the 9 billion euros that Laiki received as Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) from the European Central Bank. Anastasiades reportedly rejected this proposal and warned Lagarde that he would be forced to resign if the IMF insisted on it. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog now. News that there might be a deal in Brussels has sent the euro rising around half a cent, up at $1.3033 against the US dollar (from $1.297 a few minutes earlier). Ian Traynor has more details of the deal that appears to be on the table in Brussels tonight for euro finance ministers to consider Ian Traynor confirms that we might be back on in Brussels... The Brussels press pack reckon the eurogroup might be restarting soon: A quick reminder of the current situation: Cyprus's president, Nicos Anastasiades, has been locked in renewed talks with EU officials tonight, after a day of negotiations and deadlock in Brussels. The sticking point appears to be Anastadiades's refusal to accept the Troika's terms for the restructuring of Cyprus's banks - at one stage he reportedly threatened to resign.(see here) Cyprus's finance minister has told some reporters that the Troika want haircuts of over 50% for wealthy savers (\u20ac100k+) at Bank of Cyprus (see here) The Eurogroup of finance ministers is currently not sitting, and is expected to consider the situation sometime after Anastasiades completes his dinner with Herman Van Rompuy and Jose Manuel Barroso. Meanwhile over in Cyprus, customers of its two biggest banks have seen their daily maximum withdrawal limits cut to \u20ac100 per day. (see here) And a small homemade bomb has gone off at a local Bank of Cyprus branch. Over in Cyprus, there are reports of a small explosion causing a fire at a Bank of Cyprus branch tonight. Cypriot TV Station Sigma has some details here, and contacts in Cyprus reckon it's true (and not a major explosion either) According to Sigma's report, an \"improvised explosive device exploded at a branch of Bank of Cyprus in Polemidia\", creating a small fire at the branch. No reports of any injuries. Another of our favourite bloggers, Frances Coppola, has written a post tonight about how Cyprus's imminent capital controls would mean the country's relationship with the euro is fundamentally damaged: Here's a flavour: Once full capital controls are imposed, a Euro in Cyprus will no longer be the same as a Euro anywhere else in the Euro area. It cannot leave the island. The Cyprus Euro will in effect be a new domestic currency. The imposition of capital controls in Cyprus is therefore the end of the single currency in its present form. Yes, the Eurogroup will claim that it is \"business as usual\" in the Euro area. Draghi will continue to claim that the Euro is \"irreversible\". Eurostat will continue to produce statistics for E17 and E27 including Cyprus. But the reality will be that the Euro will be broken in two. There will be the Cyprus Euro, and the \"mainland\" Euro (if we can call it that). More here: The broken Euro More details on the deadlock... Ian Traynor reports that the Cypriot finance minister, Michalis Sarris, has been explaining the tough stance being taken by the Troika: The eurogroup is not currently meeting, as the Cypriot president holds fresh talks with Van Rompuy and Barroso -- Ian Traynor reports from Brussels. The FT's Peter Spiegel agrees, and warns that there's no certainty when (or even if!) the talks will restart. Reuters is now reporting that Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades threatened to resign during a heated exchange with European Union and IMF officials this afternoon. This confirms the rumours that engulfed Cyprus earlier this evening (see 6.39pm onwards). Here's the full story from the terminal, by Luke Baker: Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades threatened to resign during a heated exchange with European Union and IMF officials over a rescue package for his country, a senior official taking part in the negotiations said on Sunday. Anastasiades objected to a proposal that two Cypriot banks be shut down if Cyprus is to meet the terms of the bailout being offered by the EU and IMF, the official said. \"He offered to resign,\" the source said, describing the meeting, which included IMF Chief Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and other top officials, as tense. The EU and IMF are offering Cyprus a 10 billion euro bailout package as long as the government can come up with 7 billion euros itself, largely through the restructuring of its banks, a process that will mean imposing a big levy on deposits over 100,000 euros. Lorcan Roche Kelly, chief Europe strategist at Trend Macrolytics, isn't impressed: Confusingly, there has been some talk that the eurogroup meeting might be delayed until Monday morning. Our understanding was that it has just got under way. However, Cypriot spokesman Nikos Christodoulides just tweeted that ANOTHER round of talks has begun between the Cypriot president and the heads of the European commission and the European council. Clearly all is not well in Brussels tonight..... The speaker of Cyprus's parliament says that the politicians waiting back in Nicosia have been told of several 'proposals' on the table tonight: Today's delays and deadlock ahead of Monday's crunch deadline is no way to manage a crisis, some are arguing tonight. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale compares today's events to a certain Beckett play: Waiting for Godot is a play about the meaninglessness of life, which is how this evening feels (in markets, not Famille Juckes, I hasten to add before Mrs J interjects). As the attached story indicates, there has been no progress on Cyprus yet. The danger is that just as Cyprus rushes to agree a tax-take of the originally-agreed Eur 5.8bn, so the stakes go up and they need more. I'm still betting we get a standard last-minute 'kick-the-can' Euro-deal that pushes Armageddon back a few months. But I don't know... Either way, Cyprus is heading for a zombie banking system, capital controls and austerity, so that'll be fun (not). Finally, there are signs in Brussels that the eurogroup are ready to begin today's much-delayed meeting. The second face-to-face meeting between Cyprus and the EU has just finished too. Helena Smith confirms that the Cyprus is awash with rumours tonight that Nicos Anastasaides has threatened to resign. Many are calling it an expression of his frustration with the IMF, and part of the high stakes game of brinkmanship that is being played in Brussels Increasingly Cypriots felling friendless - let down by Russia and Greece which has refused to share some of its own bailout funds with Cyprus despite pleas from Nicosia. Nicos Anastasiades, Herman Van Rompuy and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso just began another meeting -- seven hours after their first one So the eurogroup meeting itself isn't actually underway yet -- we're now running 3.5 hours late... EU staffers were snapped carrying boxes of pizza to the European council building earlier this evening, as the eurogroup meeting was delayed. Refuelling for a long night ahead? A Cyprus government spokesman reports that talks are rumbling on in Brussels, with 'all options' still up for discussion. Nikos Christodoulides added that there was no sign of a deal soon: The unconfirmed rumours that Cyprus's president threatened to quit during today's talks (see 6.39pm and also this report from Greece) have let us wondering whether someone else ought to be clearing their desk instead. Especially if the crisis ends badly. This crisis has many fathers -- should Jeroen Dijsselbloem carry the can for chairing the eurogroup meeting where the original bailout was agreed? J\u00f6rg Asmussen of the ECB, who apparently helped dream up this 'solidarity levy', perhaps? Or maybe Olli Rehn - credited with first proposing the idea of a tax on all savers? Thoughts? Economist Megan Greene points out that Cyprus's banking sector would almost certainly lose the liquidity support being supplied by the ECB if president Anastasiades were to take the 'nuclear option' of resigning (and there's no official confirmation that he's made such a threat) The Cypriot delegation in Brussels is liaising with politicians in Nicosia all the time, my colleague Helena Smith reports. That means that a deal (if one comes) could quickly be pushed through parliament. Helena writes: President Nicos Anastasiades is in constant contact with political party leaders now gathered at the presidential palace in Nicosia with the RIK TV station saying he is regularly updating them on the progress of talks in Brussels. The idea is to get as much momentum behind any deal reached so that it will be passed swiftly through parliament, according to officials. Insiders are also telling me that last week's abortive talks in Moscow were \"highly embarrassing\" and the likelihood of Russia stepping in with support (which it has not ruled out if a financial aid package is reached with the EU and IMF first) \"is virtually nil.\" \"We were put in a highly embarrassing position there,\" said one official who was present throughout the talks. \"We were treated as if we were begging.\" Greek media are reporting tonight that Cyprus's president, Nicos Anastasiades, is refusing to accept the Troika's demands over the Cypriot banking sector. They say he will not agree to the Bank of Cyprus shouldering the burden of the \u20ac9bn of liquidity assistance supplied to Laiki Bank's by the European Central Bank (when Laiki is broken into a 'good' bank and a 'bad' bank). There are even unconfirmed reports in Greece that Anastasiades threatened to resign rather than cave in: The delay in Brussels tonight haven't surprised experienced eurocrisis-watchers, who point out that tonight's meeting could prove to be a historic event: (a reference to rumours of a breakdown in the sale of Cypriot banking assets in Greece). Arriving at the meeting this afternoon, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble warned reporters: \"We haven't got much further in the last week. The numbers have not changed, if anything they have worsened. I hope we will achieve a result today. But that, of course, depends on the people in Cyprus having a somewhat realistic view of the situation. Meanwhile, a Cyprus government official has confirmed that customers of Bank of Cyprus and Laiki Bank are restricted to withdrawing \u20ac100 per day (as several readers kindly confirmed some hours ago). Curiously, there are reports that the limit is \u20ac120 at some machines. Cyprus's president just tweeted that negotiations are continuing, and that his team are doing their \"utmost\" for Cyprus: Breaking: the start of the eurogroup meeting has been delayed to 7pm GMT, or 8pm Brussels time. Officials are talking about a 'lack of progress' on Cyprus following the afternoon meetings. The news came as finance ministers continued to arrive at the council building. Austria's finance minister, Maria Fekter, said the eurogroup's \"common will\" was to find a deal tonight. And France's Pierre Moscovici said the aim was to find a solution that keeps Cyprus as a member of the eurozone. The meeting between Nicos Anastasiades, Christine Lagarde, and Mario Draghi has just ended. Next up - the eurogroup meeting, where finance ministers will consider the issue of Cyprus's bailout again. Back to Brussels, where Ireland's finance minister, Michael Noonan, told reporters that he is hopeful of a deal, but warned: I'm expecting a very long night. Noonan added that the situation in Cyprus has worsened over the last week (see 4.46pm for analysis on this) Cyprus state television is reporting this evening that the deal to transfer the Greek-based assets of Cypriot banks to Piraeus (the Greek bank) has stalled. This deal was announced on Friday, and is meant to protect Greek savers from the Cyprus crisis (it ringfences Greece from the threat of a deposit tax). No further details yet, I'm afraid, but it would be a new complication to hopes of a bailout deal. The wounded, bleeding elephant in the room in Brussels today is the awful damage that has already been done to Cyprus's economy. Local firms saw business dried up as the country's banks remained closed, and customers learned the full scale of the crisis. The looming capital controls (restrictions on cash withdrawals, bank transfers, etc) will hurt trade, possibly for months. And the destruction of parts of the Cypriot banking sector will take a great, big chunk out of the country's economy. A well-respected fund manager based in London who blogs/tweets as Pawelmorski says the scale of the economic destruction achieved in the last week is unheard of by a human agency 'without the use of weapons'. He wrote yesterday The combination of laying waste to the financial sector and tearing up the savings of thousands of residents means that Cyprus won\u2019t return to current levels of output for a decade, a funeral pyre which bears comparison only with Greece. There are four shocks happening at once; the bog-standard austerity shock; the trauma of bank withdrawal controls; the wealth shock; and the structural shock of wiping out the financial sector. The bailout bill is certainly going to get a lot higher too, as a larger amount of debt is piled onto a smaller economy. More here: Cyprus: The Operation Was a Success. Shame the Patient Died. (and lots more here). And this graph, from investment bank Exotix, suggests Cyprus's economy will suffer much more pain than the Troika expects: European ministers have begun arriving for the eurogroup meeting in Brussels this evening. The Dutch deputy finance minister, Frans Weekers, told reports that Cyprus will determine its own fate (ie, by accepting the terms demanded by the Troika). But those terms remain very unpalatable, as the Telegraph's Bruno Waterfield flags up: An opinion poll has found that a small majority of Dutch voters believe Cyprus should leave the eurozone rather than receive its bailout. Reuters reports: More than half those surveyed, or 56 percent, thought Cyprus should leave, according to a survey by pollster Maurice de Hond. The results of the poll were published as Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem prepares to meet other euro zone finance ministers to discuss a bail-out for the indebted Mediterranean island. Eurozone finance ministers aren't impressed with Cyprus's plan for a solidarity fund (which would use assets as collateral for a bond sale), according to Europe editor Ian Traynor: Long queues for media entry to today's eurogroup meeting... Ian Traynor, our Europe editor, has the latest details of the negotiations taking place in Brussels, including news that depositors at Bank of Cyprus with over \u20ac100,000 could lose 25% of their assets. In the negotiations in Brussels, Anastasiades will be told that Laiki (or Cyprus Popular Bank), the country's second-biggest, must be wound down and its good assets placed with the Bank of Cyprus. But EU officials also say that Bank of Cyprus will also need to be restructured. MPs approved legislation to restructure their banking sector late on Friday night (see Friday's liveblog). Ian continues: The levy on BoC deposits of more than \u20ac100,000 euros could be as high as 25% while more money will need to be raised from a tax of up to 5% on similar deposits held in other relatively healthy banks. If Anastasiades balks at this tax, already rejected by the Cypriot parliament, the alternative appears a lot worse. There would need to be a full bail-in at BoC, with depositors trading as much as 40% of deposits over \u20ac100k for bank equity. The latter takes us back to where Christine Lagarde was last weekend. Another Nicosia resident reports that a Laiki ATM in their area was still offering the old limit of \u20ac260 a few minutes ago, and that there was no sign of queues at ATMs run by other banks. It does appear, though, that Laiki is imposing a new withdrawal limit (and Bank of Cyprus too, given the reports at 2.35pm). Two Bank of Cyprus customers have reported that the amount of cash they can withdraw from an ATM has been cut today to \u20ac100 (or possibly a little higher) Kosta Pavlowitch emailed me from the Cypriot capital: The cashpoint i have been using for the past few days in Nicosia allowed \u20ac500 per day til Friday, then \u20ac300 yesterday, and today only \u20ac100. And Steven Kimberley confirmed that his cash machine also refused to pay out \u20ac200 but would release \u20ac100 (suggesting the new maximum figure may be between the two). This follows the news earlier today that Laiki Bank has lowered its own limit, reportedly to \u20ac100 (see 12.45pm). A third reader, who is a Laiki customer, has told me that an ATM did release \u20ac260 earlier today, perhaps before the limit change was imposed. (Faisal is referring to Janine Louloudi / janinel83 , a freelance reporter on the ground) Nicos Anastasiades has completed his talks with Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy (Ian Traynor reports from Brussels). The Cypriot president has now headed for talks with Mario Draghi, Christine Lagarde and Olli Rehn over lunch. (so this crunch meeting of the main players is actually being split into at least two different sessions). Update: it appears Barroso and Van Rompuy are also at this lunch Cyprus's politicians are hoping that Greece will help fight its corner in tonight's eurogroup meting: Dimitris Papadakis, the secretary of EDEK, Cyprus's social democrats (part of the opposition in parliament), said today that Cyprus want \"substantial assistance\" from Greek finance minister, Yannis Stournaras. We need practical assistance from Greece because Eurogroup's attitude continues to be that of a blackmail, and purely anti-European. (more here) However the views of Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, will carry more weight tonight - and he has already warned that Cyprus could not avoid very tough times \"not because of European stubbornness, but because of a business model that no longer functions\". Word from Brussels that president Nicos Anastasiades and his team of Cypriot officials and ministers have arrived, ready for this afternoon's meeting: The daily cash withdrawal limit at Laiki Bank's cash machines in Cyprus appears to have been cut from \u20ac260 per day to \u20ac100, according to Michelle Caruso-Cabrera of CNBC. She just tweeted a photo showing a new warning sign being added: UPDATE: Nothing official from Laiki yet, so it's not clear if this is a general policy change. \u2022 If anyone in Cyprus can confirm, please post below the line or email me at graeme.wearden@guardian.co.uk - thanks! \u2022 Laiki's ATM machines in Cyprus have been disbursing cash to a steady stream of customers in recent days: An EU spokesman has said European Council president Herman Van Rompuy will lead this lunchtime's meeting between Cyprus and the EU. He hopes the talks can ease the way to a deal at tonight's meeting of the eurogroup. Via AP: Van Rompuy's role will not be to reach a final agreement, but to facilitate efforts to find a solution, spokesman Preben Aamann said. Any new proposal would have to be approved Sunday evening by the Eurogroup, the gathering of finance ministers from the 17 EU countries that use the euro currency. (updated) A crucial meeting will begin in Brussels in 45 minutes. Nicos Anastasiades, Christine Lagarde, Mario Draghi, Herman Van Rompuy (EC president), Jose Manuel Barroso (European Commission president) and Olli Rehn (Commissioner for financial stability) will gather at 2pm (1pm GMT) to discuss the crisis. As the Telegraph's Bruno Waterfield explains here, the international lenders may force president Anastasiades to hammer his largest bank, the Bank of Cyprus. Under the current plan, the Bank of Cyprus, will have deposits of more than \u20ac100,000 hit by a 20pc levy, while other banks will be hit for 4pc, in a desperate attempt to stave off financial meltdown. The Bank of Cyprus must also absorb Laiki assets, insured deposits and take on its ECB debt - which could add up to \u20ac9.1bn - as the bank would be wound down. In total Cypriot bank asset total \u20ac68bn, with deposits of more than \u20ac100,000 totalling \u20ac38bn. The Bank of Cyprus has over a third of bank deposits. The Archbishop of Cyprus is planning to hold talks with Russian investors later this week in an effort to stop them fleeing the country, according to Greece's Kathimerini today. Archbishop Chrysostomos is hoping to remind them how they've benefited through their time in Cyprus: The leader of the Church of Cyprus said after the Sunday mass in Nicosia that on Thursday he is going to host a dinner with the chiefs of Russian companies that are active in Cyprus to convince them against taking their money away from the island so that the situation does not deteriorate further. He added that he intends to remind them that their capital has for a long time been growing through interest, they have benefitted from their presence in Cyprus and that had they gone to another country the interest they would have got would have been just above zero. Chrysostomos also called for the previous Cypriot government (who ruled the island until last month) to stand trial for creating the current financial situation. And he added that Cypriot people must learn to live on tighter budgets as well. So might the Church.... A quick recap. Cyprus spent Saturday locked in negotiations with officials from the Troika in Nicosia, over how to raise its contribution to its bailout fund. The talks centred on the Cypriot banking system -- and the idea of a deposit tax (which was first agreed last weekend, then rejected by MPs on Tuesday, and now resurrected.) There was a burst of excitement last evening after senior Cypriot official told Reuters that the parties had agreed to a 20% on deposits over \u20ac100,000 at Bank of Cyprus, and a 4% hit on \u20ac100k+ deposits at other banks. But negotiations ended after midnight without a deal being announced, and the Cyprus government saying they had reached \"a very delicate phase\". Other officials blamed the 'inflexibility' of the IMF team for the deadlock, warning that \"\"we are not even near an agreement with the troika.\" There were rumours on Friday that the Troika had now hiked its demand on Cyprus, saying it must contribute \u20ac6.7bn to the bailout package, not the original \u20ac5.8bn. The reason? Conditions in Cyprus have worsened since the bailout began. And the IMF can only lend to a country if it is confident it will get its money back. While the two sides argued, Nicosia saw the largest protests since the crisis began last week. Here's a couple of photos: President Nicos Anastasiades is expected to meet with Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF and Mario Draghi, head of the ECB, this afternoon, to discuss the crisis enveloping the Cyprus by the hour. He will also hold talks with presidents of the European commission and European council, Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports from Brussels: Anastasiades is expected to unveil new proposals to hit wealthy Cyprus banking clients with heavy levies on their deposits in order to come up with about one-third of the \u20ac17bn bailout the country needs. A week ago he insisted on minimising the levy to less than 10% to prevent foreign investors, mainly Russians and British, pulling their money out of Cyprus. Now he is being forced to double that levy to 20%, according to reports from Nicosia late on Saturday, while sparing all savers with less than \u20ac100,000. More from Ian here. Cyprus's future in the eurozone could be decided today as president Nicos Anastasiades flies into Brussels for crucial talks over its bailout package, in an effort to avert financial catastrophe. With time running out, Cyprus and its Troika of lenders have just hours to agree a deal, An emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers and the International Monetary fund begins at 6pm Brussels time (5pm GMT), and should determine whether Cyprus receives its desperately needed \u20ac17bn loan package. Failure would put the country's future in the eurozone at grave risk, with vital liquidity provided by the European Central Bank due to be withdrawn on Monday. According to reports last night, Cyprus may impose a 20% levy on deposits over \u20ac100,000 at its biggest lender, the Bank of Cyprus, with other large depositors losing around 4%. A government spokesman has already warned that Anastasiades is tackling a huge challenge. He said the Cypriot team in Brussels face: a very difficult task to accomplish to save the Cypriot economy and avert a disorderly default if there is no final agreement on a loan accord. We'll be following the action in Brussels, and in Cyprus, through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Proposals to allow new banks to challenge established high street players will be announced this week, as the Bank of England prepares to announce the size of any capital shortfalls at the major lenders. The Bank's financial policy committee (FPC) estimated in November that banks could have a \u00a360bn hole in their capital if they made more objective assessments of the losses they faced. The FPC's pronouncement on the actual size of the shortfall are expected on Wednesday, shortly after the Financial Services Authority (FSA) sets out proposals to enable new banks to be set up more easily by allowing them to hold less capital than high street institutions. The creation of new banks to challenge the \"big four\" of RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC and Barclays, is a key plank of the government's policy of injecting competition into the sector and cut the cost of banking. In the last week of its existence before it is broken up, the FSA is expected to say that new banks will need half as much capital as existing ones while they are setting up. Last week Martin Wheatley, the head of the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which formally takes over part of the FSA's work next week, said that bank customers put up with worse treatment than in other industries, but that people are more likely to divorce than move their accounts. The FCA is being given a new mandate to oversee competition and is in the process of recruiting a new director to take control of this crucial part of its new remit. Existing banks, however, are more focused on the assessments that have been made of their capital positions. The concerns are focused on three main areas: the way that banks are offering leniency to customers in arrears (forbearance); the impact of more regulatory fines and compensation from mis-selling scandals; and the way international capital rules allow them to set aside asset capital against the risk of the loans they hold. The Bank of England has put an estimate on the three areas of up to \u00a315bn, \u00a310bn and \u00a335bn respectively \u2013 a total of \u00a360bn \u2013 although at the lowest end the estimate is closer to \u00a325bn. A survey by accountancy firm KMPG has underlined the impact on bank profitability last year of regulatory scandals - including the fixing of the Libor interest rate and the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. According to the report, combined pre-tax statutory profits at the big four and Standard Chartered slumped 40% on the previous year to \u00a311.7bn.

      "bodyText": "Britain is winning the war against tobacco smugglers who target cheap cigarettes at poor smokers and children and deny the Treasury revenue, according to a parliamentary report. In 2000, one in five of cigarettes smoked came from the black market. But by 2010-11 traffickers' share of the cigarette market had fallen to 9%, according to the report on the illicit tobacco trade by the all parliamentary group on smoking and health. Over the same period, the share of the UK's hand-rolled tobacco market originating with smugglers fell from 60% to 38%, an inquiry by the group of MPs and peers found. Joint action by HM Revenue &amp; Customs and the UK Border Agency has disrupted smugglers' efforts to bring in and distribute their products, as have partnerships involving local police forces, councils and NHS organisations, the report says. Stephen Williams, the Liberal Democrat MP who chairs the group, said the success disproved the industry's claims that high taxes on their products in the UK boosted the supply of illegal tobacco. He said manufacturers' claims that forcing cigarettes to be sold in standardised packaging would increase the illicit trade were \"self-interested and at times seemingly disingenuous industry lobbying\". Legal agreements the EU has concluded with the big cigarette firms to reduce trafficking has also helped make fewer available, the parliamentarians say. Their report highlights how the previously easy availability of black market tobacco in the UK was partly due to producers deliberately exporting more cigarettes than were wanted to other countries, knowing that many would be smuggled back into Britain. Sarah Woolnough, Cancer Research UK's policy director, said: \"This report is further evidence that the tobacco industry should not be listened to when developing health policies aimed at reducing the devastating impact of smoking.\" The Tobacco Manufacturers Association claimed that more recent data showed that \"the level of cigarettes consumed that are not UK tax paid has risen from 17% in 2011 to 21% in 2012\" and that figures from the Office of Budget Responsibility last week showed the government expected to receive \u00a3200m less in tobacco revenue in 2012-13. A spokesman for the association claimed the inquiry was biased because it had not given a fair hearing to the industry and did not mention firms' contributions to reducing smuggling.",
