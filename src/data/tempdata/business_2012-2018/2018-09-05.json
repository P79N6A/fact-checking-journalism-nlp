      "bodyText": "The British economy is losing almost \u00a3900m a year from the rapid rise in personal debt problems, according to a report from the Whitehall spending watchdog. The National Audit Office (NAO) report said reduced levels of worker efficiency, people staying away from work and greater chances of people in debt committing crime, meant there was a wider cost of \u00a3897m annually to the overall economy. It added that the taxpayer was also bearing the consequences. The organisation said the public purse was affected by indebted adults needing to use public health services and receiving housing benefits, which carried an estimated annual cost of \u00a3248m. Finding the link between debt and depression strengthening, and with it the cost to the state, the NAO said the government\u2019s debt collection practices could be making the situation worse. Figures from Citizens Advice show the proportion of problems relating to government debts increased to 40% last year compared with 21% in 2011, while problems with banks and credit card providers had been falling. Coming after a highly critical report from the Treasury committee which highlighted \u201cworst in class\u201d debt collection practices of government agencies, the NAO said a lack of data sharing between departments meant civil servants could not identify individuals who owed money to more than one arm of the state. This had meant debt collection teams competing for repayments from the same person, it added. As well as a lack of understanding of the scale of people\u2019s debt problems, auditors said the pursuit of short-term incentives and funding pressures could also be leading to debts being pursued too quickly and aggressively, particularly in local government. Responding to the report, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said it highlighted \u201cserious flaws\u201d in how the government monitored information and handled the crisis in problem debt. Sir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said the government has begun insufficient attempts to address problem debt, which affected more than eight million people. \u201cThe Treasury needs a better understanding of the scale of people\u2019s debt problems and how it is impacting their lives and the taxpayer so it can effectively resolve the problem,\u201d he said. About 8.3 million people are defined as suffering from problem debt according to the Money Advice Service, while 22% of adults have less than \u00a3100 in savings. The NAO report came as the Bank of England becomes increasingly concerned about consumer borrowing soaring to levels unseen since the financial crisis, rising at triple the rate of annual growth in pay. Campaigners blame cuts to benefits, lacklustre wage growth, the rise of precarious jobs in the gig economy, and higher levels of inflation since the EU referendum two years ago. Britain\u2019s consumer debt burden \u2013 in car loans, credit cards and personal loans \u2013 stands at more than \u00a3200bn. Those defined as \u201cproblem debtors\u201d \u2013 those unable to pay their debts or other household bills \u2013 owe at least \u00a318bn to utility providers, landlords, housing associations and the government, through, for example, council tax arrears and benefit overpayments, the report said. The Treasury has overall policy responsibility for problem debt and needs to fix some \u201cweak links\u201d which are hindering its ability to respond effectively, it added. While the Treasury was taking a \u201cthoughtful and well-intentioned approach\u201d to excessive indebtedness, the NAO said it should work with others to improve the quality and availability of information. The Treasury said it was increasing funding for the Money Advice Service, which helps people with debt, while adding: \u201cWe know that problem debt can be a struggle for some people. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking action, because we want to make Britain a country that works for everyone.\u201d Government bodies tend to lag behind the retail lending sector in following good debt management practice, the NAO said. Funding pressures, particularly in local government, could also be leading to debts being pursued too quickly and aggressively. Auditors suspect that some debts are being pursued by central and local government to satisfy targets and internal league tables. The report added: \u201cOur analysis of debt charity data found that people report more problems with debts owed to government as the fiscal year progresses, a pattern not observed with private-sector debts. \u201cA number of stakeholders we interviewed considered that this could be affected by performance metrics (for example, in-year collection targets and league tables) and funding pressures at a local level.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The latest GDP figures show the continued poor return households are getting from a strong economy. While company profits soar, real household incomes continue to fall. As a result, we have reduced our savings to keep spending at a level that sees the economy running along stronger than it has for more than five years. The latest national accounts figures released on Wednesday by the Bureau of Statistics showed that in the June quarter the economy grew by 0.9%, for an annual growth rate over the past 12 months of 3.4% \u2013 the strongest since September 2012. Similarly the annual growth of GDP per capita of 1.8% is also the strongest since that time: That is a very strong result and has the economy growing very much at an above-trend rate. It is driven mostly off the back of household spending and government consumption. While the level contributed by households is roughly in line with the size of that segment of the economy, the 1.0% pts contributed by government consumption, which is equivalent to around 30% of the annual growth, was an outsized contribution, given it accounts for around 20% of the economy: There was also a pick-up in dwelling construction, giving a second act to the housing boom of the past: The contribution of household spending came via a solid 3.0% increase in consumption over the past year, which reflects a general increase in such growth over the past four years; however, it remains well below the 3.5% 25-year average growth rate: Such improvement would generally reflect a strong growth in household income. After all, that is a 3% increase in real terms, so you would think it means incomes are rising solidly. But what the figures reveal is that the increase in spending by households is coming from them reducing the amount they are saving. In June, households saved just 1.4% of their income in trend terms \u2013 the lowest level for a decade \u2013 and it marked a record 14th consecutive quarter of the savings ratio falling: The reason is clear \u2013 wages and household incomes are not growing at a level that enables households to keep spending without eating into savings. The good news is that households are not just spending money on essentials. One of the strongest areas of spending growth was recreation and culture, but it is clearly not because we are feeling flush with money \u2013 more that after spending money on essentials we have decided to use our savings to have a bit of a holiday or night out. A look at the growth of the compensation per employee reveals the issue. While the annual growth of total compensation of 4.9% is as strong as we have seen for over six years, the annual growth of average compensation per employee of 1.7% is woefully low: Yes, the economy is growing well, but the income is flowing right now towards corporations. In June the share of total factor income going to the compensation of employees fell to 52.2% \u2013 among the lowest ever in the past 50 years: Not surprisingly this has meant a sharp fall in the real cost of labour. The real non-farm unit cost of labour (essentially the amount it cost on average to produce one more \u201cunit\u201d of output) fell to a record low of 94.4 in trend terms: Employers have absolutely no reason to be complaining about wages at the moment or whining about losing international competitiveness \u2013 especially with company profits over the past two years rising by 28%. Pleasingly there has also been an improvement in labour productivity after a dip in the past 12 months, but there has not been any improvement in real household incomes. While the average compensation per employee rose 1.7% on the past year, that remains below the increase in inflation of 2.1% \u2013 meaning that yet again in real terms average compensation fell and remains below the level it was eight years ago: This has flown through into household disposable income, which fell again in relation to inflation. This has been the case for two years straight now, and for most of the time since 2015. It means that real household disposable income is at the same level it was in 2011: Are the GDP figures good? Certainly growth of 3.4% is excellent. If it continues, it should see unemployment fall, and even the per-capita growth of 1.8% is roughly in line with long-term trend rates. It is also good to see the housing construction picking up again. But the growth is going to be hard to sustain without the income from strong profit growth flowing through to actual wages growth as opposed to just increased employment. Households will not be able to keep reducing the amount they save at the levels they have been for the past year. Household spending growth in the long term can only be sustained by real increases in household incomes \u2013 and we have not seen that for a very long time now. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "Many of the arguments in the IPPR\u2019s prosperity and economic justice report would probably raise a cheer or two in big British boardrooms. Not every director is a wild advocate for the shareholder-first version of capitalism that the report diagnoses as a major failing in the UK economy. Far-sighted business folk happily concede that short-term horizons can lead unhappily to under-investment and the pursuit of impossible targets. It\u2019s just that, when it comes to one specific recommendation in the IPPR\u2019s report, one can hear the howls of outrage already. The idea that large companies of more than 250 employees should have at least two elected workers on both their main board and their remuneration committee will be damned as unworkable, naive and a certain route to making companies uncompetitive. That response, remember, greeted Theresa May when, in the period before she lost her parliamentary majority, she enthused about workers on boards. The prime minister\u2019s idea was squashed in stages by the corporate lobby, to be replaced by a limp government proposal to give one existing non-executive director the additional role of looking out for workers\u2019 interests. The revised formulation is so loose as to be meaningless. Opponents of workers on boards should read the IPPR report with fresh eyes. It makes some clear-headed arguments for thinking again about giving workers a real voice in the boardroom. First, the report makes the point that worker representation is not nearly as radical as made out. In 13 European countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Ireland, workers have significant rights of representation in the private sector. Yes, there are examples where the arrangement has gone spectacularly wrong \u2013 a sub-plot to the Volkswagen emissions scandal was a cosy relationship between executives in search of bonuses and union bosses in pursuit of job guarantees. But, in general, there\u2019s a strong correlation between worker representation and engagement. The UK tends to score terribly on the latter. Second, the idea that a company owes its only true allegiance to its shareholders doesn\u2019t reflect the relative risks. Shareholders, especially when they are really fund managers, are an ever-changing cast with diversified risks and no fear of bankruptcy. Workers, by contrast, have their livelihoods at stake and, usually, a longer relationship with the company. A governance model that tries to balance the various interests looks fundamentally fairer. Why should promoting \u201cshareholder value\u201d above all else be the over-riding duty of the directors? The third point covers executive pay, the poison that has done most to erode trust in business. \u201cExecutive pay appears to be more a reflection of who decides it \u2013 the corporate governance arrangements \u2013 than of company performance,\u201d says the report, giving an excellent summary of what\u2019s happened in the past 25 years. Putting workers on pay committees wouldn\u2019t necessarily slow the gravy train. But a more diverse set of decision-makers would surely be an improvement on the current you-scratch-my-back set-up in which the non-executive class is drawn primarily from other companies\u2019 executives. In the end, opponents of worker-directors usually argue that the UK\u2019s tradition of unitary boards makes reform impossible. That technical objection currently carries some weight but it should be a surmountable obstacle. Tweak the Companies Act, to redefine a company\u2019s responsibilities beyond the promotion of shareholders\u2019 interests, suggests the report. The thinktank is not the first body to make that proposal, but the idea is sound. Nobody, of course, should pretend that putting workers on boards is an easy cure for all the woes of low productivity, low investment, short-termism and high rates of pay inequality. But the sense of unfairness in current governance arrangements is strong. The balance of power within companies looks out of whack and boards would be wise to wake up. The IPPR is pushing in the right direction and May, before she was overwhelmed by Brexit, was on to something.",

    "webTitle": "US trade deficit hits five-month high, as emerging markets slide \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our round-up of the slide in emerging market stocks today, and the factors behind it: Goodnight! GW Emerging markets have fallen into a bear market tonight, the FT reports. That means stocks in developing countries, such as Indonesia, South Africa, Argentina and Turkey, have fallen 20% from their recent peak. As the FT puts it: The FTSE Emerging index of nearly 800 of the biggest companies in the developing world fell 1.6 per cent, its sixth straight decline and the biggest in three weeks, which pushed the benchmark to its lowest since July 2017. They also flag up that currencies, as well as equities, are feeling the strain against the US dollar: Indonesia\u2019s rupiah traded close to its weakest level since the 1998 Asian financial crisis, while the South African rand slipped to a record low after data on Tuesday showed the country\u2019s economy had contracted for the first time since 2009, exacerbating concerns over the developing world more broadly. Europe\u2019s major stock markets also had a bad day today, amid the ripples from the emerging markets rout. In London, the FTSE 100 shed 74 points, or 1%, to 7,383 - its lowest close since April (partly due to the sterling rally) But there were bigger losses in Europe, with the French CAC down 1.5% and Germany\u2019s DAX shedding 1.4%. David Madden of CMC Markets says: worries about global trading relationships and the decline in emerging market economies are hurting market confidence. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has written a blogpost to mark the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In it, she warns that not enough has been done to repair the damage caused by the financial crisis, or to avoid another one. In the article, she says: \u201cWe have come a long way, but not far enough. The system is safer, but not safe enough. Growth has rebounded but is not shared enough.\u201d \u201cLooking back today, the pressure points seem obvious. But they were less obvious at the time. Most economists failed to predict what was coming. It is a sobering lesson in groupthink.\u201d \u201cIf the policy response to these pre-crisis risks was inadequate, I would say that the immediate policy response to the crisis was impressive. The governments of the major economies represented by the G20 coordinated policies on a global scale. \u2026 Indeed, the importance of international cooperation in meeting 21st century challenges is one of the enduring lessons of the crisis.\u201d Lagarde also suggests that male dominance of Wall Street was a factor - a few more sisters at the top could have made a big difference.... More here: Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, flags up that the South African rand is being dragged lower by today\u2019s emerging market selloff. The spike in the pound has hit shares in London (as it makes overseas earnings in foreign currencies less valuable). The FTSE 100 is now down by 93 points, or 1.25%, in late trading. Newsflash from Ottawa: The Bank of Canada has left Canadian interest rates on hold, at 1.5%. The BoC also warns that trade uncertainty is hurting Canada\u2019s economy: Elevated trade tensions remain a key risk to the global outlook and are pulling some commodity prices lower. Meanwhile, financial stresses have intensified in certain emerging market economies, but with limited spillovers to other countries. Boom! The pound has just jumped on the foreign exchange markets, on report of a Brexit breakthrough. But investors should stay cautious - there\u2019s nothing official at this stage. Bloomberg is reporting that Germany is ready to accept a less-detailed agreement on future ties between the UK and the European Union, to get a deal done. The UK, for its part, would accept a more vague statement of intent on the future relationship, according to anonymous sources quoted by the newswire. If true, this would suggest the two sides are amenable to unblocking the current deadlock. This could cut the risk that Britain crashes out of the EU next March without a deal. Traders reacted quickly, sending the pound back to $1.296 - its highest level this week. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says there are two reasons to treat the news cautiously: First, Germany does not \u2013 despite its clear dominance of the bloc economically - actually speak for the EU position. Michel Barnier may well have something to say about this report. As might Theresa May. Second, we\u2019ve heard these kinds of rumours lift the pound before and it should be treated with caution. There is a strong chance that this rally could run out of steam and retrace in fairly short order. But, it nevertheless it does still point to a degree of softening in the general tone of talks and that a deal is more likely than not. Both the widening American trade gap, and the slide in emerging markets today, can be partly blamed on the stronger US dollar. That\u2019s due to the robust US economy, and the prospect of higher interest rates to curb inflation -- as Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts give the economy a sugar rush. Quite... Mexican politician Jorge Guajardo believes Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on America\u2019s trading partners are partly to blame for the widening US trade gap: White House insiders might want to hide today\u2019s trade data from the president... Not only has the US trade deficit widened, but the gap with Canada has hit a 10-year high. This surplus widened to 5.3bn Canadian dollars in July, from C$4.1 billion the previous month, This may make Trump even more determined to reach a new North American trade deal, as NAFTA talks restart in Washington. Bloomberg says: The figures released Wednesday in Ottawa are likely to play into the resumption of bilateral talks in Washington over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has signed a new deal with Mexico and has threatened to leave Canada out and impose stiff auto tariffs if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government doesn\u2019t make concessions. Even the metal products targeted by U.S. tariffs showed some resilience in the latest figures. Canadian shipments of steel climbed 16 percent in July after a 36 percent drop in June, while a 2 percent fall in aluminum still left those exports 8.1 percent higher than they were a year prior. Newsflash: America\u2019s trade deficit has widened to a five-month high, in a blow to Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to cut it. US imports jumped by $2.2bn to $261bn in July, according to the latest trade data from the Census Bureau. Exports shrank by $2.1bn, though, to around $211bn, due to lower sales of aircraft and soybeans (which now face tariffs when sold to China). This drove America\u2019s overall trade deficit up to over $50bn. The White House won\u2019t be pleased to see that America\u2019s goods trade deficit with China surged 10% to a record $36.8 billion. So what\u2019s happening? The Wall Street Journal\u2019s theory is that tax cuts and higher federal spending \u201cgoosed up\u201d domestic demand, while a cooling economy overseas hampered exports. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, blames trade war anxiety and the strengthening US dollar for today\u2019s selloff: \u201cGlobal stock markets continue to be volatile as the trade dispute between the United States and China continues to escalate. Slowing Chinese growth has unsettled investors as the impact of the ongoing trade dispute continues to impact the Chinese economy. Asian stocks are currently lower with all major markets recording losses. The Shanghai Composite index, Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI all made losses in light on going spat between the two largest economies. The Indonesian Index is down 3.7% as downward pressure on EMs continues. European markets have also opened lower, due to the same concerns. Emerging markets are also continuing to suffer as the likes of Turkish inflation are causing concern amongst investors. Most EM currencies are under pressure with today concerns being focused on Indonesia, Argentina and South Africa. As a result of these risky economies and markets, the dollar has become a safe haven for many, allowing it to surge to its latest high\u201d It feels as if the dollar and Amazon stock price is the only asset going up! Here\u2019s Dean Popplewell of City firm OANDA on the losses across emerging markets today: Soured sentiment has left several Asian stock markets with their biggest declines in a fortnight, at least since the bout of EM worries that were fuelled by the TRY\u2019s plunge. In Japan, equities held up better than most, perhaps helped by the overnight yen softness (\u00a5111.47). Nevertheless, investors remain worried that Sino-U.S tariff war could escalate weighed on sentiment. The Nikkei share average dropped -0.51% for a fourth consecutive session while the broader Topix fell -0.77%. Down-under, Aussie shares extended their losses for a fifth consecutive session overnight, closing down -1%, brushing aside a robust economic growth report (Q2 GDP +0.9% vs. +0.7%) as materials stocks slid on weaker commodity prices. In S. Korea, the Kospi plunged -1.03% as trade war fears intensify. In Hong Kong, stocks posted their biggest loss in 11-weeks on growth and trade war fears. Overnight, investors\u2019 dumped property, energy and tech stocks amid worries about China\u2019s economy and the Sino-U.S trade war. The Hang Seng index fell -2.6%, while the China Enterprises Index lost -2.3%. Emerging market currencies are also having a bad day, with most falling against the US dollar today: Back in the financial world, the rout in emerging markets is gathering pace. Emerging stock markets across the globe are in the red, as a nasty cocktail of threats hit equities. The selloff in Asia overnight has now spread to the Middle East. Saudi Arabia\u2019s stock market is the worst performer, plunging more than 4% at the last count. Indonesia\u2019s market has slumped by 3.7%, and there are losses from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Mumbai, Cairo and Johannesburg. Shares are being hit by several factors, including: The slowdown in China\u2019s service sector last month The global impact of the US-China trade war, and the prospect that America implements tariffs on an extra $200bn of Chinese imports later this week The strengthening US dollar, which is sucking capital out of emerging markets and pushing up the cost of repaying debts taken out in dollars There are also isolated individual factors. South Africa fell into recession yesterday, while Argentina is pushing the IMF for a larger bailout to support its economy. So investors are fretting that the global economy may slow, especially if more emerging markets follow Argentina and Turkey into financial crisis. As Christoph Barraud, an economist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities, put it: \u201cUntil last month people were focusing on U.S. company earnings but now they are looking closely at what\u2019s happening in emerging markets, at the trade war and the fact that the United States is likely to implement another wave of tariffs against China. If you look at global growth, more and more signs are that it will slow in coming months.\u201d Cambridge, Oxford, Warrington, Reading and Swindon are all feeling the brunt of the worker shortage, apparently. Jobs site Adzuna says each of these cities have more than 15 vacancies for every jobseeker, putting labour in a strong position (theoretically, anyway). Despite the hiring struggle, the UK economy is on track to grow by 0.4% in the current quarter, Markit estimates. That would match the UK\u2019s growth rate in April-June, and beat some City forecasts. But still, it would be fairly modest growth compared to the years before the EU referendum.... Morgan Stanley say they \u201ccontinue to anticipate weakness in the economy going forward, as we enter the final stretch of Brexit negotiations.\u201d Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, is concerned that UK firms can\u2019t find the staff they need. Here\u2019s his take on the PMI report: \u201cThe services sector was a little more upbeat than the other sectors this month maintaining a steady level of activity growth, and the number of new orders ticked higher. \u201cDespite this, optimism was more subdued and lower than the survey average. With the weakest business optimism since March, uncertainty around the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU continued to dampen client operations. Struggles around securing talent and the right skills were also a drag on a sector highly-dependent on trained staff even though job creation rose to its highest levels for half a year. UK firms are also suffering from uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Business confidence about future prospects hit the lowest level since March, today\u2019s PMI report shows. That\u2019s due to \u201cpolitical uncertainty and the unpredictable impact of Brexit on clients\u2019 business operations.\u201d Chris Williamson of Markit adds: \u201cBusiness expectations for the year ahead meanwhile sank markedly lower, down across all three sectors to one of the lowest levels seen since the EU referendum, largely reflecting increased anxiety over Brexit negotiations. \u201cGiven the increasingly unbalanced nature of growth and the darkening business mood, risks to the immediate outlook seem tilted to the downside.\u201d Good news for UK workers -- the staff shortage is forcing some services firms to pay them more. Markit says: Difficulties recruiting suitably skilled staff contributed to higher salary payments in August. Breaking: Growth in Britain\u2019s service sector rose last month...but firms are finding it harder to recruit the workers they need. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit\u2019s monthly survey of Britain\u2019s services companies. Purchasing managers from large and small UK service firms reported that business activity rose at a faster rate in August, partly thanks to a boost in new work. However, many also said that \u201ca lack of suitably skilled candidates to fill vacancies had held back staff hiring\u201d. That staff shortage held some firms back. Markit explains: Backlogs of work increased for the fourth month running in August, which pointed to sustained pressure on operating capacity at service sector companies. A number of firms linked rising volumes of unfinished business to difficulties replacing departing staff. This may be a sign that EU workers are heading home ahead of Brexit, or that potential migrants aren\u2019t coming over the UK at all. Last month\u2019s unemployment figures showed a record annual decline in migrants from the European Union to the UK. Britain\u2019s unemployment rate is also at a 43-year low, so firms may simply be suffering from a tight labour market. Overall, Markit\u2019s UK service PMI jumped to 54.3 in August, up from 53.5 in July -- the second highest level since February. That shows faster growth. More to follow.... Just in: Britain\u2019s car sales rose by almost a quarter in August. Just over 94 thousand new cars were registered in the UK last month, a jump of 23.1% compared to August 2017. That sounds impressive... until you remember that August is typically a quiet month for car sales (drivers who wait until September will get the new year\u2019s number plate). Despite this jump, registrations in 2018 are still 4.2% lower than this stage last year, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders. But still, demand for hybrid and plug-in cars surged by 88.7%. One in 12 buyers chose an electric car - a new record. The SMMT adds: Demand was up across the board, with consumers and fleets boosting year-on-year registrations by 23.3% and 19.7% respectively, while the smaller business sector rose 166.4%, equivalent to an uplift of around 1,500 units against August last year. Superminis remained the most popular buy, followed by small family and dual purpose cars, with the luxury saloon and city car segments recording the most notable growth, up 120.8% and 39.6%. European companies are also worried about trade wars. Markit\u2019s new survey of eurozone purchasing managers, just released, show that business expectations in the service sector hit a 21-month low in August. It blamed \u201cgeo-political trade tensions\u201d. More encouragingly, the euro-area private sector kept growing last month. But as this chart shows, Italy moved worryingly close to stagnation (which would be a PMI of 50). Commodity prices are also being hit by the drop in Chinese company growth. The price of copper in Shanghai has hit a 14-month low, while prices in London are down 2.6%. This is dragging down the share prices of mining giants, and thus pulling Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 down by 0.4% in early trading. Global stock markets are in the red this morning, as the slowdown across China\u2019s companies worries investors. The Shanghai Composite Index has dropped by 1.7%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index has shed 2.7%. Most European markets have opened lower too, with the Stoxx 600 index of major EU companies down almost 0.5%. Investors are fretting about trade, as Donald Trump could sign off an extra $200bn of tariffs on Chinese goods in the coming days. US officials are also due to resume trade talks with Canada later today, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The main preoccupation for investors continues to be on whether the US is serious about arriving at some form of deal with Canada over NAFTA in the wake of President Trump\u2019s tweets at the weekend, that it wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t a political necessity to get a deal In addition to that anxiety levels are growing ahead of the weekend and the possible imposition of another $200bn worth of tariffs on Chinese goods later this week. Hong Kong\u2019s companies are also feeling a chill from the US-China trade wars. Growth across Hong Kong\u2019s private sector declined in August, data firm Markit says. Output and new orders both shrank, forcing job cuts. It adds: Notably, export sales to China fell again amid escalating trade tensions. Companies remained pessimistic about future output, which was also accompanied by another drop in purchasing activity and input inventories. Consequently, firms reduced selling prices to support sales despite a further rise in input costs. Both employment and backlogs continued to decline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business Trade war anxiety is growing this morning, after China\u2019s companies posted disappointing growth. Business activity growth across China hit a five-month low in August, a new survey from data firm Caixin shows. The country\u2019s service sector led the slowdown, with growth hitting a 10-month low. Companies reported that new business growth was weak, forcing factory bosses to cut jobs. Business confidence was also subdued. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says China\u2019s economic growth is on a \u201cdownward trajectory\u201d, adding: Inflationary pressures were pronounced as increases in both input prices and output prices accelerated. The future output sub-index went up after falling in August, which was likely boosted by the fine-tuning of macro policies. The employment sub-index was unchanged from July\u2019s reading and remained in contraction territory. \u201cAugust\u2019s PMI readings indicated that the effects of expansionary credit policy and active fiscal policy are yet to kick in. Signs of stagnation emerged as upward pressure on prices remained even though demand weakened at a faster rate.\u201d The report suggests that the trade dispute with America is hitting demand and confidence. The US has already imposed tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports, with president Donald Trump threatening more. Caixin\u2019s Composite Output Index, which measures growth across Chinese companies, fell to a five- month low of 52.0 in August, with the services PMI hitting just 51.5 - the lowest since October 2017 (50 = stagnation). Here are the key points from the report: Services activity growth edges down to ten-month low, while manufacturing output increases at faster pace Composite new work expands at weakest pace for over two years Steeper rises in input costs across both the manufacturing and service sectors Reaction to follow.... Later today we discover how Britain, and the eurozone\u2019s, service sector firms fared in August -- as company bosses watched the clock tick towards Brexit in March 2019. Also coming up today... Ten years after the financial crisis, a UK thinktank is proposing some radical changes to fix the economy\u2019s problems. The IPPR is calling for higher wages, more government spending on infrastructure, extra wealth taxes and more power for workers, to tackle growing inequality. The report comes out later today.

The Wealth-X World Ultra Wealth 2018 report, published on Wednesday, said there had been a \u201csharp acceleration\u201d in the number of UHNW people due to \u201csignificantly more favourable conditions for wealth creation, despite still volatile geopolitics\u201d. The rate of growth of the UHNW population was far faster than in 2016, when it grew by 3.5%. Collectively, the quarter-of-a-million UHNW people have a combined fortune of $31.5tn \u2013 almost double the GDP of the US. \u201cBuoyed by a synchronised upturn in the world economy, rising asset markets and robust corporate earnings, the combined net worth of the ultra-wealthy population increased by 16.3% to $31.5tn,\u201d the report said. \u201cA testament to the auspicious economic climate, the ultra wealthy population and its total net worth increased in all seven major regions.\u201d The fastest growing region was Asia, with China and Hong Kong becoming particularly wealthy.

Wealth creation was also supported by enhanced trade and investment links with mainland China, including a direct trading connection between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen bourses.\u201d The US is still home to the most UHNW people with 79,595, followed by Japan with 17,915 and China in third place with 16,875.

      "bodyText": "House of Fraser is facing further pressure after a key supplier pulled brands from stores. The Edinburgh Woollen Mill (EWM) group, which owns the Jacques Vert, Jane Norman and Jaeger brands, and also manufactures men\u2019s suiting for the retailer\u2019s Linea label, began withdrawing its stock on Wednesday. A spokesman for the group said: \u201cThis decision was not taken lightly and follows a period of extended and sustained negotiations with House of Fraser. \u201cOur brands have a long history with House of Fraser and we worked hard to try to secure a satisfactory arrangement. But sadly we have not been able to agree future trading terms that give us confidence in the security and continuity of the House of Fraser business.\u201d The exit of EWM\u2019s brands, which had concessions in 35 stores, comes as House of Fraser battles to secure stock distribution to its stores and to online shoppers after a dispute with XPO, the company which runs its two warehouses. More than 600 workers at theMilton Keynes and Wellingborough sites have been told their jobs are likely to go. House of Fraser\u2019s website remained closed on Wednesday, three weeks after it was shutdown because XPO refused to process goods without payment for services in the run-up to a takeover of the department store chain by the Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct group nearly a month ago. Administrators for House of Fraser have indicated XPO is owed more than \u00a330m, although it is understood that the actual figure could be less than half that. XPO is the biggest loser among more than 1,000 suppliers which will not receive any money from the administrator EY, which was called in before of the sale of the retailer to Sports Direct for \u00a390m. Philip Day, who owns EWM and fought Ashley for ownership of House of Fraser, was owed nearly \u00a33m. But it is understood that EWM\u2019s exit is not linked to this debt. A spokesman for EWM said: \u201cWe remain firmly open to discussions with House of Fraser, and hope they will engage with us. We have also received a firm guarantee from the top management of Sports Direct that all sales since the takeover will be paid in full on 10 September, and anticipate that that guarantee will be honoured.\u201d",

He asks whether there might be varieties of magical experience and suggests that such a book has yet to be written. Such a book does indeed exist. A recent edited volume, Magical Capitalism, covers topics ranging from contract law to science, by way of finance, business, marketing, advertising, cultural production, and the political economy in general. Its contributors \u2013 all anthropologists \u2013 argue that the kind of magic studied by their predecessors in less developed societies \u2013 shamanism, sorcery, enchantment, the occult \u2013 is not only alive and well, but flourishing in the midst of so-called \u201cmodernity\u201d.

Brian Moeran Moretonhampstead, Devon \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty (Opinion, 5 September) captures well the path to the 2008 financial crash and how it might appear as though nothing has since changed.

The problem was poor incentives for banks and rating agencies. Many could imagine in a very theoretical, academic sense, had they thought for a moment, that any one of the big players could fail, as soon as their particular portfolio of commitments came home to roost and market confidence evaporated. But no one at the top could really envisage this scenario actually materialising, that the de facto spiral of reinsurance-type transactions would all be triggered at once and that Lehman would be the one to fail when the music stopped. The wisdom of the Federal Reserve allowing Lehman to fail will be debated for ever more, but contrary to Chakrabortty\u2019s suggestion, finance is unrecognisable today. The \u201cLehman price\u201d is a vastly tamed industry. Profit margins are wafer-thin, incentives are rightly contained, and the burden on execution for any finance player obliges transparency to regulators, capital ratios and due diligence like never before.

Knight Frank said foreign buyers snapped up 2,162 properties valued at a combined \u00a32bn in the year to the end of May, up from \u00a31.65bn in the previous year. Liam Bailey, Knight Frank\u2019s head of research, said the properties \u2013 which had an average value of \u00a3925,000 \u2013 were bought to be used as a base while the owners\u2019 children were at schools such as Eton, Westminster and Harrow, or universities in or near the capital. \u201cOur analysis shows just how important the standard of top London schools is to wealthy international individuals, and the demand this contributes to the London property market,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThe majority of overseas buyers appear unconcerned by the impact that Brexit may have on the UK as a place to educate their children and there have even been signs that it has become more attractive to some. \u201cGiven the potential 10-year span of education for children that come over as young as 11 or 13, many of these parents are looking at a longer-term commitment as opposed to a short-term investment.\u201d According to the research, most of the demand is from buyers from China and Hong Kong, followed by those from Singapore, India and Russia. An 18-year-old student from China recently moved into a \u00a35m two-bedroom flat in the refurbished Centre Point building, which she will live in while studying at University College London. The 117 sq m apartment has panoramic views from the bedroom stretching from the Royal Albert Hall to Wembley Stadium. Kathrin Hersel, the property director of Almacantar, Centre Point\u2019s owner, said she was surprised at first that a student would be living in the building, but then realised \u201cthere is a lot of money coming from Asia and they [the parents] want to make sure their children are close to their studies\u201d. She said the parents were attracted to the building because of its location \u201cin the very heart of London\u201d and the high level of security, including a 24-hour concierge, keycard entry and security cameras in every lobby. The communal facilities are also slightly better than the average hall of residence. Those living in the building have access to a 30m swimming pool that stretches the length of the building, as well as a gym, sauna, spa and private cinema. The tenants of the affordable flats do not have access to any facilities. Henry Pryor, a luxury property buying agent, said he is often tasked with purchasing properties for rich overseas university students to use instead of halls of residence or shared houses. \u201cAn awful lot of people do buy property in London and other academic centres like Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and Leeds, to give their kids a base and have somewhere to stay when they visit. It also gives the parents the option of a good income stream,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "More than 700 jobs are set to be saved after the Gaucho restaurant chain was bought out by its lenders. Investec Bank and debt specialist SC Lowy, who were together owed about \u00a350m by Gaucho\u2019s parent Gioma, plan to acquire the Argentinian-themed chain\u2019s 16 restaurants which employ 750 people via a credit bid. The deal is dependent on the successful completion of an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement, which will enable the company to shed liabilities including leases linked to Gioma\u2019s defunct Cau chain as well as tax and trade debts. A spokesman for Investec said: \u201cWe have supported Gaucho since 2016 and continued to provide support to the business through the difficult conditions experienced in 2018. We know the Gaucho team well and have significant confidence they can reinvigorate and grow the Gaucho brand.\u201d Creditors will decide whether to approve the CVA on 19 September and the buyout is likely to be finalised by mid October after a 28-day period during which landlords and other creditors are able to challenge the legally binding deal. Accountants from Deloitte were appointed joint administrators to the owner of the Gaucho and Cau chains in July leading to the immediate closure of the 22-strong Cau restaurant chain which employed 540 people. The Gaucho chain continued to trade while Deloitte sought a buyer. Gioma examined a number of potential restructuring options but ran into crisis when a tax bill of more than \u00a31m became due in July. Matt Smith, a partner at Deloitte, said: \u201cWe are delighted Investec and SC Lowy have agreed to purchase Gaucho, which offers the best outcome for all parties. Gaucho is a profitable and successful business and with the support of its new owners can now focus on its future growth plans.\u201d Gaucho is among a string of high street dining chains to run into trouble amid a squeeze on consumer spending and over-expansion fuelled by private equity investors. Prezzo, Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian have shut outlets and cut hundreds of jobs while veteran restaurateur Sir Terence Conran\u2019s Prescott &amp; Conran venture called in administrators in June.

Writing on the IMF blog ahead of the 10th anniversary of the US investment bank\u2019s collapse next week, the head of the International Monetary Fund said significant measures had been taken to fix the financial system, although she warned more work was still required, particularly on gender diversity. \u201cAs I have said many times, if it had been Lehman Sisters rather than Lehman Brothers, the world might well look a lot different today,\u201d she said. The chief executives and chairs of Britain\u2019s four biggest banks are all male, while the proportion of female board directors at companies across the wider FTSE-100 ranking of major British firms is in decline. There are, however, exceptions, such as at Santander UK, where Shriti Vadera is chair, and Virgin Money, where both the chair and chief executive are female. Research from the IMF shows a higher proportion of women on the boards of banks and financial supervision agencies is associated with greater stability. Lagarde called the collapse of Lehman Brothers a \u201csobering lesson in groupthink\u201d that many economists had failed to spot coming. In this context, she said a key ingredient of reform would be more female leadership in finance. \u201cGreater diversity always sharpens thinking, reducing the potential for groupthink,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThis very diversity also leads to more prudence, and less of reckless decision-making that provoked the crisis.\u201d The failure of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the oldest and biggest investment banks in the world before its humiliating demise, triggered a ripple effect in the global financial system as banks around the world stopped lending to one another for fear they might not get their money back. \u201cIn the immediate aftermath of Lehman, we were really staring into the abyss,\u201d Lagarde said, calling the collapse a \u201choly cow\u201d moment for the world economy. Governments in the US and Europe stepped in with taxpayers\u2019 money to bailout struggling lenders, including RBS and Lloyds in the UK, to protect their economies from losing valuable access to finance. There have, however, been lasting effects, as the crisis triggered damaging recessions across the developed world, with severe consequences for living standards still being felt. Lagarde said the heavy economic costs borne by ordinary people, combined with anger at the bank bailouts and bankers enjoying impunity, was among key factors behind the rise of populism and backlash against globalisation. Economists believe the recession in the UK, government austerity and weak wage growth, coupled with this anger, are among key reasons for the Brexit vote two years ago. \u201cWe have come a long way, but not far enough. The system is safer, but not safe enough. Growth has rebounded but is not shared enough,\u201d she added.",

    "webTitle": "Fresh wave of shares and currency sell-offs hits emerging markets", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Emerging markets have been hit by a renewed wave of sell-offs in shares and currencies, with Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and China among the countries hit by trade war tensions and a strengthening dollar. European shares also fell on Wednesday as investors registered concerns over the impact on the global economy if more emerging markets were to follow Argentina and Turkey into financial crisis. Markets weighed the threat of a new development in the US-China trade war \u2013 fresh US tariffs on another $200bn (\u00a3155bn) of Chinese goods could be confirmed as soon as Friday \u2013 as well as weak Chinese service-sector growth figures and news this week that South Africa is in recession. The dollar rose for a fifth day, making it more expensive for emerging market countries to repay their dollar-denominated debts, while commodities fell, led by oil. City investors tend to buy US dollars \u2013 seen as the global reserve currency \u2013 during periods of financial market turbulence. This can however exacerbate the difficulties facing emerging market nations. Christophe Barraud, an economist at the Paris-based brokerage Market Securities, said: \u201cPeople are looking closely at what\u2019s happening in emerging markets, at the trade war and the fact that the United States is likely to implement another wave of tariffs against China. If you look at global growth, more and more signs are that it will slow in coming months.\u201d The raising of interest rates by the US Federal Reserve has further strengthened the dollar, with economists growing increasingly concerned that the fallout for developing nations may be on a par with the emerging market crises of the 1990s. Tighter monetary policy under the former Fed chair Alan Greenspan triggered a series of crises across the developing world. Low interest rates used since the financial crisis have depressed investors\u2019 returns on developed market debts, pushing them to invest more money in emerging markets to seek greater returns, exacerbating the problem further. In Asia, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng posted its biggest loss in 11 weeks on Wednesday, falling 2.6%, while the Shanghai Composite index fell 1.7% and the Shenzhen Composite dropped 1.6%. The sell-off spread to the Middle East, where the Saudi stock exchange fell 3.1%. Indonesian stocks took their biggest tumble in nearly two years, with the Jakarta stock exchange down 3.8%. The rupiah\u2019s fall to 20-year lows prompted the country\u2019s authorities to intervene to prop up the currency and bond markets. President Joko Widodo said the government\u2019s priority was to increase investment and exports to rein in Indonesia\u2019s current account deficit. India\u2019s rupee hit a record low of 71.78 to the dollar, prompting its central bank to intervene, according to Reuters. South Africa\u2019s rand slid again, by 1%. Emerging market fears also contributed to a tough day for European shares, with the FTSE 100 closing down 1%, Germany\u2019s Dax shedding 1.4% and the CAC in Paris falling 1.5%. In Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s government is trying to negotiate an accelerated $50bn rescue package from the International Monetary Fund. Its president unveiled fresh austerity measures on Tuesday and admitted the country faced an \u201cemergency\u201d in a plea to international lenders and investors, following the peso\u2019s collapse in recent days. Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at the currency broker FXTM, said: \u201cIt has certainly been a terrible trading week thus far for most major emerging market currencies as investors begin to compare the ongoing pressure to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.\u201d Currency weaknesses can cause problems for countries by pushing up import costs, which leads to a rise in inflation, as seen in Britain following the vote to leave the EU. Government and central bank policy responses to control the rising cost of living can have a damaging effect on economic growth, such as higher interest rates or austerity measures, meaning a general slowdown for developing nations may be looming on the horizon. Despite the concerns over emerging markets, many investors have so far remained sanguine about the risk of the crisis spreading to damage the stability of the global financial system, or lowering developed nation economic growth. But that risk has steadily been increasing. William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the bigger risk was from a potential slowdown in the US or China, although he added: \u201cThere is little evidence to suggest that the market turmoil is translating into widespread macroeconomic strains.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is to close a further 54 branches in England and Wales with the loss of 258 jobs. The closures, in January 2019, come on top of the 162 branches the bank axed in May. The Unite trade union was quick to condemn the move, saying: \u201cIt is utterly disgusting that Royal Bank of Scotland has the audacity to announce that yet more important local bank branches will permanently close their doors.\u201d The RBS group, which is 62% taxpayer-owned, said all the branches being closed are Royal Bank of Scotland-branded. Explaining its decision, the group said customers were spurning the traditional branch counter service, where transactions were down 30% since 2014, in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. It added: \u201cCustomers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales will be able to use NatWest branches and local post offices for their everyday banking needs.\u201d The announcement means that after the New Year there will only be about 50 Royal Bank of Scotland-branded branches left in England and Wales. Derek French, the former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services (CCBS), said his prediction was that \u201cby the end of next year, all the RBS[-branded] branches in England and Wales will be closed \u2026 they are not viable as a separate, standalone unit. South of the border, NatWest is their brand.\u201d The CCBS closed in 2016, although French is arguably the country\u2019s leading expert on branch closures. In May, RBS said it was closing 162 branches in England and Wales during the second half of this year with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. In December 2017 it announced the closure of 259 branches. The latest announcement will fuel concern that many more communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. An RBS spokesman said the size and shape of its branch network across NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland \u201cwill be stable until at least 2020\u201d. The closures come after the European Union had originally demanded the sale of some branches as a condition of the taxpayer bailout a decade ago. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale \u2013 which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer, so the Williams &amp; Glyn business is being reintegrated back into the core bank. The spokesman said: \u201cAs we are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other in England and Wales \u2013 NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. As a result we have reviewed our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and have made the difficult decision to close 54 Royal Bank of Scotland branches\u2026 \u201cWe will now focus on investing in our Royal Bank network in England and Wales to make sure customers have a consistent range of products and services wherever they bank, be it Scotland, England or Wales.\u201d",

The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply (Cips) for the services industry \u2013 which accounts for almost 80% of national economic output \u2013 suggested companies are being held back from carrying out their activities by the labour shortage. The dwindling availability of workers comes after official figures last month showed a record annual decline in migrants coming from the EU, which economists say will act to reduce the number of people available to companies. While labour shortages could drive up wages by increasing the bargaining power of workers, observers are growing increasingly concerned for future economic growth. According to the survey, there were widespread reports that tightness in labour market conditions had constrained employment growth. The figures follow a drop in the UK unemployment rate to 4% in the three months to June \u2013 its lowest level since the winter of 1974-75 \u2013 further reducing the number of people available to work. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, the chief economist at WorldFirst, said the survey data followed several other poor readings for economic growth. \u201cAnother day, another survey showing Brexit uncertainty weighing on a part of the UK economy,\u201d he said. The IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index, which is closely watched by the Bank of England for early warning signs from the economy, increased to 54.3 in August from 53.5 a month earlier, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. A reading above 50 represents economic growth. The survey of services companies \u2013 including transport and communications firms, banks, hotels and restaurants \u2013 found optimism for the year ahead had dropped to the lowest level since March. Growth in new work accelerated moderately last month, which will be welcome news for the economy, although it remained weaker than average for the past two years. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the drop in confidence was to the lowest levels seen since the EU referendum. \u201c[This is] largely reflecting increased anxiety over Brexit negotiations,\u201d he said. Despite the mounting concern over Brexit, the reading from the PMI points towards economic growth of around 0.4% in the current quarter, which would match the UK\u2019s growth rate in April-June, and beat some City forecasts. The reading also followed better news for the economy from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which recorded a 23.1% jump in car sales in August from the same month a year earlier.

But he cautioned against celebrating too much, saying the 11-month decline in house prices had yet to bite properly. \u201cOur big concern is that at some point households will falter in the face of low income growth, falling house prices, tightening credit conditions and rising mortgage rates,\u201d he wrote to clients on Wednesday. \u201cThe further fall in the household saving rate from 1.6% to a post-GFC low of 1% indicates they may have overextended themselves. The global environment is becoming less supportive too. \u201cAs the RBA has been expecting the economy to perform well, these data don\u2019t mean that the RBA is suddenly going to rush to raise interest rates. But the markets may start to reconsider their view that interest rates won\u2019t rise until sometime in 2020.\u201d In the June quarter, growth in domestic demand accounted for over half the growth in GDP. Domestic demand increased by 0.6%, driven by 0.7% growth in household spending reflecting strong sales of food, recreation and culture, and furnishings and household equipment. Household consumption has grown 3% through the year, accompanied by a large decline in the household savings ratio. The household savings ratio fell from 1.6% to 1% of disposable income - its lowest level since December quarter 2007 - in the June quarter. Frydenberg put a positive spin on the decline in household savings, saying it was important to remember people were still saving. He also pointed out wages and salaries had risen 0.7% in the June quarter, to be 4.8% higher through the year, driven by increasing employment. However, Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said the wages data were more disappointing than they seemed. He said wages themselves only increased 0.1% in the quarter, to be 1.8% higher over the year. \u201cWith the household consumption deflator at 1.5% for the year, this implies that real wages growth remains weak at only 0.3% for the year,\u201d he said. The household consumption deflator is a measure of inflation. It tracks the prices paid for all consumer goods, rather than just a basket of goods. If nominal wages are growing at 1.8%, and inflation is running at 1.5%, the \u201creal\u201d value of growth in wages is just 0.3%, which is exceptionally weak. Economists say the ongoing weakness in wages explains why Australians are continuing to draw down on savings to fund consumption. They also say for households to sustain consumption at current levels they will need wages growth to lift noticeably. \u201cWith Australia\u2019s savings ratio already at historically low levels and wages likely to increase only very gradually, it appears the most likely outcome is for households to tighten the purse strings and for spending to slow,\u201d JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy said. \u201cTighter credit conditions exacerbate this dynamic.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison says he will reverse the Abbott-Hockey decision to lift the pension age to 70, and take it back to 67. The plan to scrap the decision would be presented to cabinet next week when parliament returns, the prime minister said. \u201cI\u2019ve already consulted my colleagues on that,\u201d he told Channel Nine\u2019s Today Show on Wednesday. \u201cNext week cabinet will be ratifying a decision to reverse taking the retirement age to 70. It will remain at 67, which is what Labor increased it to. \u201cIn this year\u2019s budget I announced a whole package of measures to help Australians live a longer, healthier, more active life and that included things like the pension work bonus and supporting people who are older to actually get access to the pension when they are running a business. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need that measure any longer when it comes to raising the pension age, and it is one of things I will be changing pretty quickly. I\u2019ve talked to my colleagues about it. We\u2019ll ratify it next week.\u201d When Labor was last in government it legislated a gradual increase in the pension age from 65 to 67 years by 1 July 2023. The former prime minister Tony Abbott then proposed lifting the pension age from 67 to 70, starting on 1 July 2025 when the pension age would increase from 67 years by six months every two years until 1 July 2035, when it would reach 70. The Senate has never allowed the legislation to be formalised and it has become one of the 2014 budget\u2019s \u201czombie\u201d measures that has remained Coalition policy. Labor has repeatedly attacked the government for the measure since then. In 2014 the then treasurer Joe Hockey said the increase in the pension age to 70 was necessary to keep the system sustainable. \u201cWhat we are going to do is to deliver a fairer system for the aged pension that is going to focus on the sustainability of the system with a reasonable quality of life,\u201d he said the lead-up to the 2014-15 budget. \u201cThe aged pension expenditure today is currently more than we spend on defence. \u201cIt\u2019s rising to $72bn rapidly, that\u2019s over 6% growth. One of the reasons why is because we\u2019re ageing \u2026 but the pension kicks in currently at 65. When Labor increased it to 67 by 2023 we gave them bipartisan support. When we introduce legislation to increase it to 70 by July 2035 ... we expect that there will be bipartisan support. \u201cThe aged pension needs to be a safety net by 2035, not a cargo net.\u201d In 2014, Morrison supported lifting the pension age to 70, voting for it in the House of Representatives. He then defended the policy when he was treasurer, saying it was necessary to ensure the system\u2019s sustainability, given Australians were healthier and living longer in retirement. However, he says it is no longer needed. Ian Yates, the chief executive of Council on the Ageing Australia (COTA), has welcomed Morrison\u2019s decision. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised, this wasn\u2019t going to get through the senate in its current form anyway,\u201d Yates told the ABC\u2019s Radio National. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said you shouldn\u2019t compulsorily increase the pension age to 70 without a more comprehensive retirement income review. A lot of people do want to keep working, but if people are stuck on Newstart, for example, that\u2019s just not a good look to extend that by another three years.\u201d Yates said COTA supported Labor\u2019s decision in 2009 to increase the pension age from 65 to 67, for anyone born after 1 January, 1957, but 70 was too much. \u201cIt\u2019s in keeping with the increased longevity that [Australians are] experiencing,\u201d he said about the 67 years threshold. \u201cBut it does mean that we need to tackle things like Newstart and mature age unemployment, and those are significant challenges.\u201d By the middle of the century, the number of Australians aged over 65 is expected to double, to just under nine million. Yates said Morrison\u2019s decision would be a vote changer for some people. \u201cIt was not a popular policy and it wasn\u2019t going to get through the senate,\u201d he said.",
