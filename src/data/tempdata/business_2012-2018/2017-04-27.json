      "bodyText": "Barclays\u2019 chief executive is facing a shareholder revolt at next month\u2019s annual meeting because of the ongoing regulatory investigation into his attempts to unmask a whistleblower. Shareholders are being advised to abstain from the annual vote to re-elect the American banker Jes Staley to the board by ISS, an influential adviser to major investors, in a sign that the bank could face a significant protest vote against its chief executive at the 10 May AGM. Barclays would not comment on the advice issued by ISS, but took steps to avoid a rebellion over the election of Sir Ian Cheshire as a non-executive director by promising investors that he would reduce the number of board roles he holds at other companies \u2013 dubbed \u201coverboarding\u201d by investors. Staley will be braced for questions about his conduct when the bank reports its first-quarter results on Friday. He has issued a written apology for becoming too personally involved in the whistleblowing case, which related to the conduct of Tim Main, who worked with Staley at US bank JP Morgan and was then recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June. Both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority are investigating the matter. Barclays has formally reprimanded Staley and insisted that there will be a significant reduction in his bonus, which was \u00a31.4m last year. Staley became chief executive in December 2015 at a time when the bank was scrambling to repair its reputation in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis and other scandals. Not only is it unusual for City regulators to investigate the conduct of chief executives of major financial institutions, it is also unusual for major proxy firms to issue advice to abstain against their re-election to the board. Cheshire \u2013 who was boss of Kingfisher, owner of B&amp;Q \u2013 is also facing a revolt. He is intended to become chairman of Barclays \u201cringfenced bank\u201d \u2013 mainly the high-street operations \u2013 which must be set up by 2019 under rules intended to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. But he also chairs retailer Debenhams, French furniture company Maisons du Monde and investment company Menhaden Capital, and is senior independent director at Costa Coffee owner Whitbread \u2013 the role he is regarded as most likely to relinquish. Proxy advisory group Glass Lewis is recommending voting against Cheshire\u2019s appointment, while ISS has recommending backing him on the basis that he needs time to cut back his other roles, but will review the situation next year. Barclays said plans were in place for Cheshire to reduce the number of his directorships. \u201cSir Ian was appointed to the board on 3 April 2017 and has committed to Barclays and its regulators that he will reduce his other directorships by September 2017,\u201d the bank said.",

      "bodyText": "Tickets for the first non-stop flight from the UK to Australia went on sale on Thursday as Qantas launched a direct flight between London and Perth. Daily flights on Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner aircraft will take off on the new route from 25 March 2018, with return fares starting at \u00a31,095 or A$1,893. The airline said it was the next stage in the evolution of the so-called \u201ckangaroo route\u201d, facilitated by the more fuel-efficient Dreamliner. The direct Perth flight will take 17 hours to carry passengers 9,000 miles, a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the route to London in 1947. \u201cWe\u2019ve said the Qantas Dreamliner is a game changer, and that\u2019s becoming real today,\u201d said Alan Joyce, the chief executive of the Australian airline. \u201cThe kangaroo route has kept changing with new technology. It used to take four days and seven stops but now we\u2019re able to link Australia and UK in a single hop. It\u2019s a level of convenience Australians have never had before.\u201d Passengers travelling from Melbourne to London will now be able to transfer in Perth, rather than Dubai, reducing their total travel time by more than an hour, the airline said. Qantas added that fares may fall to as low as \u00a3900 return during deal periods. The flight between Perth and London will be the longest flight on the Qantas network and the longest Dreamliner flight in the world. Joyce said Qantas had focused on greater comfort in its Dreamliner cabins and would offer a lower seat count that most of its competitors. \u201cWe\u2019re conscious that this is a long flight, but not much longer than our Sydney to Dallas service,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of route that the Dreamliner was created for, because of its built-in features to reduce jet lag and improve the overall travel experience.\u201d He said the route, first announced in December, would appeal to both tourists and business travellers. \u201cThis route makes Western Australia a new tourism gateway for Australia. We know from our research that there\u2019s a lot of appetite to explore the west, not just from British and European visitors but also from Aussies on their way to London. A lot of business travellers, particularly in the resources sector, will stop off in Perth on their way to the UK,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s probably all for today (I\u2019ll pop back if anything dramatic happens). Thanks for reading and commenting. GW AFP have a good write-up of Mario Draghi\u2019s comments about US trade politics: ECB chief Mario Draghi said Thursday that the threat of protectionism may be diminishing, sounding a cautiously optimistic tone amid global fears that Donald Trump\u2019s America First policy could spark trade wars. Asked what he had learnt about the Trump administration\u2019s economic policies during a recent trip to the US, Draghi replied: \u201cOne has to be very tentative in this, one thing that may have come out of the meetings is that perhaps the risk of trade protectionism may have somewhat receded.\u201d Draghi did not go into details, but his assessment came at a time when major international organisations including the World Bank, IMF and OECD have been warning about rising risks of protectionism. With a nationalist economic agenda, the Trump administration has vowed to upend decades of prevailing trade policy by renegotiating or scrapping trade agreements, imposing hefty tariffs and moving to bilateral trade agreements. The US had also refused at a G20 meeting in March to renew a long-standing anti-protectionist pledge, to the dismay of the group of top developed and developing nations. Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, says the ECB is unwilling to change course, even though the economy is improving and political risks are fading: Low core inflation is clearly weighing in their minds, suggesting policymaker caution will dominate for at least a few more meetings. While the second half of the year might get more interesting if the better run of data continues and core inflation starts to trend higher, asset purchase levels and benchmark rates will likely hold for at least the next few meetings. Bill Adams, economist at the PNC Financial Services Group, enjoyed Draghi\u2019s slapdown of Germany\u2019s finance minister: Draghi pushed back against criticism of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy from Germany\u2019s Finance Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble by calling it \u201cironic\u201d that a supporter of independent monetary policy would criticize that the outcome of that independence. This statement immediately followed Draghi saying he doesn\u2019t comment on the statements of politicians. This is the closest you\u2019ll ever see to a central banker saying \u201chaters gonna hate.\u201d The ECB\u2019s monetary policymaking process is well insulated from political pressure. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says the ECB has shown that its asset purchase programme is \u2018here to stay for now\u2019. \u201cThe crux of today\u2019s presser was the fact that even though growth has improved and certain Governing Council members are more \u201csanguine\u201d about economic risks, the inflation outlook has not improved sufficiently for the ECB to formally consider an end to QE. Anyone hoping for a barn-storming performance from Mario Draghi today will have been disappointed. The simple message from the ECB today is that the eurozone recovery is strengthening and broadening, with risks diminishing ; but the inflation outlook looks subdued, so there\u2019s little pressure to consider tightening monetary policy. Draghi did paint an encouraging picture, saying: The signs of a stronger global recovery and increasing global trade suggest that foreign demand should increasingly add to the overall resilience of the economic expansion of the euro area. But despite that, Draghi insists that it\u2019s too early to withdraw stimulus: A very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium-term. In terms of my criteria the (inflation) assessment hasn\u2019t really changed. The reaction of the euro says it all - rising when Draghi talked up the recovery, but diving once the ECB president sounded dovish on inflation. Draghi was nimble enough to avoid saying anything controversial about the French election, declaring: In the Governing Council meetings we discuss policies, not politics. (behind the scenes, he must be crossing his fingers and hoping for a Macron win, of course). He went a little further when asked about Donald Trump, suggesting that \u201cperhaps the risk of trade protectionism may have somewhat receded.\u201d. And Draghi\u2019s call for more help for the \u2018losers\u2019 of globalisation underlined how the \u2018elite\u2019 have woken up to the social problems building in Europe (although he made similar comments last September too). Q: What headline would you write to sum up today\u2019s meeting? The headline, giggles Draghi, is... The risks surrounding the eurozone growth outlook, while moving to a more balanced configuration, are still tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. I\u2019m sure some of us have written worse.... And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Summary and reaction to follow.... The press pack are demanding more answers from Draghi about the French elections. Q: Surely the battle between pro-EU Emmanuel Macron and anti-EU Marine Le Pen is a concern? The governing council discusses policies, not politics, Draghi reiterates firmly. But he has also conceded that the ECB does \u2018internalise\u2019 information about potential political uncertainty which might affect its ability to get inflation on target in the medium-term. Draghi is making some rather dovish noises about the inflation outlook: He also touched on Brexit, warning against thinking that the negative consequences of Britain\u2019s EU referendum are over. Draghi has called for eurozone politicians to do more to help those who have lost out from globalisation. It would be a mistake to ignore the social unease across the eurozone, the ECB chief warns. It is clear that globalisation had \u201cextraordinary benefits\u201d, Draghi explains, but \u201cit also created losers who were not taken into account of several years\u201d. There should be greater social consideration for those who don\u2019t benefit, or lose out, he concludes. Q: What did you learn about the situation in the US during your trip to Washington for the IMF/World Bank meeting? One thing that may have come out of the meetings is that the risk of trade protectionism may have receded, Draghi replies cautiously. Draghi says the ECB did not discuss changing its forward guidance (to maintain interest rates at present or lower levels). Q: Did the ECB discuss its exit strategy from its asset purchase scheme, and how it would communicate it? We did not, Draghi says. He adds that growth is improving, the recovery is broad and solid Draghi then takes aim at claims that its stimulus programme have created more inequality. He points out that eurozone unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since the crisis began. There is no better measure of increased equality than by increasing employment. The euro is a little volatile as Draghi speaks. It rose to $1.903 when Draghi declared that downside risks have fallen, only to drop back as he says there isn\u2019t enough evidence to change the ECB\u2019s inflation outlook. Q: Six years ago, the ECB raised interest rates too early, forcing you to cut them. Is that experience influencing policy this time? Draghi says he doesn\u2019t quite understand the logic of the question. In 2011, inflation was above target - today, it\u2019s not, so there isn\u2019t the same pressure to raise borrowing costs. Draghi is in a feisty mood! He slaps down a question about criticism from German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, saying it was ironic to hear this from someone who supports central bank independence. Q: Did any governing council members disagree about where the \u2018balance of risks\u2019 lies? Draghi says there was a discussion, everyone agreed that the risk outlook is improving, but still tilted to the downside. Onto questions. Q: Did the French election, and the prospect of Emmanuel Macron becoming president, influence your decisions this month? We don\u2019t set monetary policy based on election outcomes, Draghi shoots back Nice snap summary of Draghi\u2019s statement: Draghi ends with his usual call for eurozone governments to do their bit, saying other policy areas must contribute \u201cmuch more decisively\u201d. The eurozone still needs a \u201cvery substantial degree of monetary accommodation\u201d in order to get inflation back to a sustained level of 2%. Draghi says that underlining inflationary pressures are still low, and predicts that inflation will probably remain around its current levels until the end of the year. Economic indicators suggest that the eurozone economic recovery is increasingly solid, Draghi declares. And importantly, he adds that downside risks to the eurozone have diminished. But... risks are still tilted to the downside - due to global factors - Draghi adds. That means the ECB hasn\u2019t yet reached the point where it thinks risks are broadly-balanced - a situation where it might start paring back its stimulus programme. Mario Draghi begins by reading out the key points from today\u2019s statement - namely that: Interest rates remain unchanged. The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time The bond-buying stimulus programme is expected to run at \u20ac60bn per month until the end of December 2017, or beyond The ECB could increase the size or duration of the programme, if needed Mario Draghi is late! Ah...here he comes now. Mario Draghi is about to face the press pack in Frankfurt, to explain today\u2019s decisions. Here\u2019s a live feed from the ECB\u2019s headquarters: With exquisite timing, Germany\u2019s inflation rate has risen to 2% this month. That\u2019s up from 1.5% in March, according to figures just released by the Federal Statistics Office. This is slightly above the ECB\u2019s target for euro area inflation, and will put more pressure on the ECB to consider winding back its stimulus programme. Ana Boata, European economist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, predicts that eurozone interest rates will stay on hold until 2019. Here\u2019s why: \u201cThe Eurozone economy is strengthening, but we don\u2019t expect the ECB to start raising interest rates until 2019. The most likely scenario is that interest rates increase to two per cent by 2022, which will push interest payments for the total private sector up by \u20ac160 billion compared to their current level, a moderate increase. There are no significant changes in the language of today\u2019s ECB statement, compared to the one released after March\u2019s meeting. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the ECB\u2019s decision: Newsflash: The European Central Bank has left borrowing costs across the eurozone unchanged. That means the headline interest rate remains at 0%, an alltime low. The governing council has also vote to leave its deposit facility rate at -0.4% . That means banks must suffer a negative interest rate when they leave cash in the ECB\u2019s vaults. The ECB\u2019s marginal lending facility - charged on banks when they borrow from the ECB - stays at 0.25%. The ECB has also voted to leave its stimulus programme unchanged, meaning it will keep buying \u20ac60bn of new bonds each month. It adds that it could boost, or cut, the programme, depending how the recovery shapes up: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. Tension is building.... ....up to a point, anyway.... Economists at Societe Generale predict that the ECB\u2019s governing council will sound more optimistic about growth today, but resist making any major changes to their language. They say: \u201cThe ECB will likely acknowledge a further improvement in the balance of risks by pointing to upside risks to growth, However, no material changes to its dovish communication are likely and we only expect the medium-term risks to be described as balanced in June.\u201d Kathleen Brooks of City Index also expect Mario Draghi to sound restrained: After all, the risks to inflation - CPI dipped in March - are still tilted to the downside and this could be one reason to delay tapering. The other reason is the precarious state of the Italian banking sector. Its banks hold the largest amount of bad debt in all of Europe. If the ECB reduces the amount of liquidity in the European financial system too quickly then it is hard to see how these banks can recapitalise themselves, and avoid selling off some of their bad debts at a book value so low that it hits their capital position. This could ultimately cause a much bigger problem for the ECB and the wider European banking sector. Today\u2019s ECB meeting could be rather a damp squib, I fear. The central bank won\u2019t want to rock the eurozone boat before the French election is over. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA , says \u201cvery little\u201d is expected from the ECB: The meeting falls in between the first and second round of the French Presidential elections, with eurosceptic Marine Le Pen one of the two candidates set to battle it out for the Presidency on 7 May. While the central bank may want to avoid appearing to interfere in the election, it will be interesting to see whether the reference to downside risks is scaled back in order to avoid playing into Le Pen\u2019s hands, or whether they talk up the progress achieved this year and the improved prospects for the region. Over in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank is wrapping up this month\u2019s monetary policy meeting. In less than 45 minutes, we learn whether the ECB\u2019s governing council voted to change interest rates or tweak its stimulus programme (spoiler alert: almost certainly not). There\u2019s a small chance that it will adjust the language in today\u2019s statement. If not, all eyes and ears will turn to the press conference at 1.30pm BST, when Mario Draghi will field questions from the press. The big question is when the ECB might begin the process of slowing (or tapering) its bond-buying stimulus programme. IG Group\u2019s Josh Mahony says: \u201cThe big question is when we will hear from the ECB regarding a potential tapering of the current asset purchase facility. Draghi has already said that the eventual unwinding of the quantitative easing (QE) programme will involve a tapering of the asset purchase size, the timeline of which we will have to see laid out in advance. With that in mind, it is always worth noting that at some point, we will face the repercussions of a more hawkish Draghi, and the market response to such an event. Will it be this week? Probably not. The CBI\u2019s monthly healthcheck on Britain\u2019s retail sector suggests that sales jumped this month as consumers kept spending. Around 59% of retailers surveyed said that sales volumes were up in April on a year ago, whilst 21% said they were down, giving a balance of +38%. That\u2019s the highest balance since September 2015. It\u2019s a bit of a surprise, given concerns over higher inflation. This survey is quite volatile (and only tracks 112 firms), so we should be cautious. Clothing and grocery sales were particularly strong, apparently -- perhaps warmer weather encouraged shoppers to buy summer outfits and even risk a barbeque?! But...the CBI predicts that growth will slow in May, as rising inflation hits the high street. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees that consumers will cut back: There is also a strong likelihood that consumer confidence and willingness to buy major items will soften \u2013 as it is not only pressurized by weakened purchasing power but also by increasing concerns over the economy and jobs as growth likely slows and uncertainties are magnified by Brexit coming more to the forefront now that Article 50 has been triggered. Wall Street is expected to open flat in nearly four hours time, as traders await reaction to Trump\u2019s tax plan. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says there\u2019s a \u201cclear sense of anti-climax in markets\u201d about the lack of nitty-gritty released yesterday. That means Congress will now \u201cchisel out\u201d the details, he adds. Breaking: Economic confidence in the eurozone has jumped this month, to its highest level since the financial crisis struck. The EC\u2019s monthly economic sentiment survey, just released, has jumped to 109.6 this month, up from 108 in March. That\u2019s the best reading since August 2007. A narrower measure of business confidence also rose sharply, with builders, industrial firms and service sector companies all more upbeat. This will bolster hopes that the European economy is strengthening. We\u2019re not exactly in \u2018boom\u2019 territory yet, but recent data has definitely shown growth is pretty solid. This probably won\u2019t be enough to encourage the ECB to alter its policy stance at today\u2019s meeting, but it shows why some economists expect a change in language in June. Pensions are a hot topic in the UK right now, with speculation that the Conservative Party might drop the \u2018triple-lock\u2019 (a pledge that pensions rise by 2.5% per year, or in line with earnings or inflation if they\u2019re higher). But the OECD thinktank argues that Britain should go further, and stop giving anything to richer pensioners. Mark Pearson, deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs with the OECD, has told the Financial Times that the system is under strain, with more people reaching pension age. Pearson says politicians face a choice - and means-testing the pension could be the answer. \u201cFaced with these pressures, are you going to ask people of working age to pay more, or people to work longer before they can claim their pension? \u201cOr another way to ensure an adequate pension is to think about whether the pension should only be paid to those who really need it, to ease the tyranny of the maths. Giving less [pension] to the people at the top would free up resources to increase general benefits.\u201d Here\u2019s our story on his comments: Britain\u2019s housebuilders appear to be doing well, despite the uncertainty created by Brexit. Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey have both reported solid result this morning, pushing their shares up 0.8% and 0.5% respectively. Persimmon\u2019s total forward sales revenue is up 11% year-on-year, while Taylor Wimpey\u2019s order book is 2% higher. Taylor Wimpey\u2019s CEO Pete Redfern says he\u2019s optimistic that the UK general election won\u2019t disrupt the market. As well as the tax reform plan, investors are also digesting the surprise news that Donald Trump no longer wants to abolish the NAFTA free trade agreement. This huuuge u-turn broke last night, after talks with the leaders of Canada and Mexico: The whole episode is a \u2018shambles\u2019, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index, who writes: Overall, this suggests that both communication and policy decision making are a shambles at the White House right now, with extreme and more moderate forces vying to get Trump\u2019s attention. Overall, this Nafta issue highlights that policy implementation risk is surging under the Trump administration, and could stoke volatility if it continues. The dollar has also dipped this morning, taking the greenback close to its lowest level in five months. That\u2019s pushed sterling back over $1.29. FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed says investors are sceptical that Trump\u2019s proposed cuts will get through Congress: The lack of details contained on Trump\u2019s single piece of paper was perceived as a publicity stunt for the President as he celebrates his first one hundred days in the Oval Office, and unfortunately, seemed more of a wish list than a serious starting point. UK bank Lloyds is defying the selloff, with its shares jumping 4% at the open. The City is impressed that Lloyds has doubled its profits in the last quarter, as its recovery from the financial crisis continues. But there\u2019s a wrinkle -- it has set aside another \u00a3350m to compensate customers who were missold PPI, plus \u00a3100m for victims of fraud at its HBOS branch in Reading. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the problem with Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan - Not Enough Detail! Alongside cutting corporate tax rates to 15%, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn revealed that the USA\u2019s 7 tax brackets would be reduced to 3, while the alternative minimum tax would be slashed and nearly all of the current tax deductions eliminated. Yet when pressed for more information, specifically if these reforms would be revenue neutral, the pair came up short, producing some Trumped up rhetoric about how it would pay for itself through \u2018growth, reduction of deductions and closing loopholes\u2019 and that the administration had a \u2018once in-a-generation opportunity to do something really big\u2019. Here\u2019s the damage across Europe\u2019s markets this morning: Hopes that Trump\u2019s economic council would offer some surprises in yesterday\u2019s tax plan have been dashed, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. He adds: In focus today will be fallout from Trump\u2019s tax announcement, having disappointed by being merely a proposal framework and still facing the same Congressional hurdle (deficit hawks on both sides of the aisle) that he was unable to clear with Healthcare reform. European stock markets have fallen at the start of trading as traders give their verdict on Trump\u2019s tax policies. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 27 points or 0.4%, while France\u2019s CAC 40 has lost 0.2%. One trader joked that the \u2018Trump trade\u2019 has turned into the \u2018Trump fade\u2019, as optimism about the president\u2019s policies weakens Konstantinos Anthis in the ADS Securities research team says: Investors focused on President Trump\u2019s tax reforms were disappointed by the lack of any real detail. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit isn\u2019t impressed by the lack of detail in the Trump tax plan. Christopher Hayes of MSNBC thinks a lot more work is needed: Broadcaster and academic Linda Yueh is also struck by the lack of detail: After all the razzmatazz, Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform plan has left investors rather cold. If you\u2019re going to promise one of the biggest tax cuts ever, you need to present more than one side of A4 paper peppered with bullet points. So the broad brush policies presented last night haven\u2019t really impressed the City. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has closed in the red, down 0.2%, and European markets are expected to dip this morning too. The top line of Trump\u2019s plan includes slashing corporation tax from 35% to 15%, cutting a key tax on the richest Americans, reducing the number of tax brackets, abolishing most tax deductions, and lowering the rate on corporate profits brought back from overseas. But there\u2019s precious little detail about how the plan would be paid for -- so critics are quickly calling it a tax cut for the rich. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says investors wanted more: Markets had been hoping for more in the way of specifics, in particular the percentage level of the one-off profits tax, which it is hoped will prompt technology companies to repatriate the billions of dollars in profits currently held overseas, as well as some indications on timings, and how the cuts would be funded. These still appear to be some way off, and appear unlikely to go through this year, though we may get something on healthcare by the end of the month. In any case the effect on the US dollar is likely to be a negative one given that markets will have to wait a while longer for a repatriation boost. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s European Central Bank Day, when the world\u2019s investors turn to Frankfurt to listen to Mario Draghi\u2019s view of the eurozone economy. The ECB is expected to maintain its very loose monetary policy stance today, concluding that inflation and wage pressure remains limited. But with Europe picking up speed, and the pro-EU Emmanuel Macron expected to become French president, Draghi may face some pressure from hawkish colleagues. So, we might get some hints that the ECB might change their policy stance in the coming months, perhaps as early as June. The main decisions on rates and stimulus measures are announced at 12.45pm BST (1.45pm in Frankfurt). Draghi\u2019s press conference is 45 minutes later. Royal Bank of Canada expects Draghi to take a relaxed approach, saying: After the market\u2019s \u2018hawkish\u2019 interpretation of the March meeting we expect that Draghi will purposely look to strike a more dovish tone in his press conference along the lines of his recent speech to the annual \u2018ECB and its Watchers\u2019 conference earlier this month. He argued that, despite an improving growth backdrop, the conditions under which the ECB could begin to consider tightening policy had yet to be met, meaning that that there was no cause to deviate from the current policy path and forward guidance, including what it implied about the sequencing of policy changes Also coming up today.... It\u2019s a busy morning for corporate news as the reporting season enters full swing. Financial groups Lloyds Banking Group and Deutsche Bank, Pharmaceutical firm Astra Zeneca, housebuilders Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey and advertising giant WPP are all reporting results this morning. Later today, Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Ford and Starbucks will report. There\u2019s also some economic data which might move the markets 10am BST: Eurozone consumer confidence for April 11am BST: UK retail sales for April 1.30pm BST: US durable goods orders for March We\u2019ll be tracking all the main news through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Profits at Lloyds Banking Group more than doubled in the first three months of the year, despite another hit for payment protection insurance mis-selling and the cost of compensating customers for fraud in the HBOS Reading branch. The bank, which is Britain\u2019s largest mortgage lender, shrugged off the uncertainty created by Brexit and what Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive, described as a \u201cchallenging\u201d operating environment. \u201cThe UK economy continues to benefit from low unemployment and reduced levels of indebtedness, and asset quality remains strong and is stable across the portfolio.\u201d Profits in the three months to the end of March doubled on the same period last year, to \u00a31.3bn. After one-off items and other factors, underlying profits were flat at \u00a32bn. Taxpayers\u2019 stake in the bank has now fallen from 43% to below 2% and last week Philip Hammond said the government had recouped the \u00a320.3bn that was used to buy the stake during the 2008 crisis. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said this was a \u201csource of pride\u201d for employees at the bank. The shares rose by 4.5% to 70p, remaining below the 73.6p average price per share at which the government bailed out the bank following the HBOS rescue in 2008, but buoyed by hopes of future dividend payments to shareholders. Horta-Os\u00f3rio insisted the bank would compensate victims of the HBOS Reading fraud \u201cfairly, swiftly and appropriately\u201d. The bank has set aside \u00a3100m for the fraud, for which six people were jailed in February after a jury was told how they spent the proceeds on superyachts and sex parties. The bank had previously warned it would take another \u00a3350m provision to cover the cost of PPI mis-selling, taking its total hit for this scandal to more than \u00a317bn. There was a further \u00a3100m in unspecified misconduct charges. Horta-Os\u00f3rio is facing speculation that he will leave once the taxpayer stake has been completely sold but he said he was happy at the bank, which is in the throes of taking over credit card company MBNA. The Bank of England has warned about the rapid growth in consumer borrowing as Britons rack up debt on credit cards, car purchase schemes and personal loans but Horta-Os\u00f3rio said this was not a problem for Lloyds, which also owns Lombard vehicle finance. \u201cConsumer credit is increasing from a very low level,\u201d said Horta-Os\u00f3rio. But Paul Pester, chief executive of TSB, which was spun out of Lloyds three years ago, was more cautious, questioning the practice in the credit card industry to tout zero interest offers on balance transfers. TSB, now owned by Spanish bank Sabadell, reported a 40% drop in first quarter profits t0 \u00a332m after a \u00a330m increase in fees it pays to Lloyds following the split. Lloyds has benefited from being able to borrow cheaply on the wholesale markets, the Bank of England\u2019s funding schemes, and attracting deposits from commercial customers, which has helped bolster its profitability. Its closely watched measure of profitability \u2013 net interest margin \u2013 was better than analysts had expected. \u201cNet interest income surpassed expectations for the first time in ages,\u201d said analysts at Jefferies. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said the bank had also increased its forecasts to generate capital, which he said supported his thesis of a full-year dividend of 5p per share \u2013 higher than the consensus of 3.8p per share. Steve Clayton, manager of a Hargreaves Lansdown income fund, said: \u201cLloyds\u2019 ability to generate capital, and its limited needs to retain much of that within the bank mean that it has great dividend potential. Sure enough, they have raised their guidance for capital generation which bodes well for the prospects for additional special dividends.\u201d But Lloyds\u2019 revenue increased by just 1% and its overall lending slipped by 1%. Horta-Os\u00f3rio is implementing a three-year cost-cutting programme to axe 12,000 jobs from the bank\u2019s 75,000-strong workforce and is closing 400 branches this year.",

    "webTitle": "Taylor Wimpey to pay up to \u00a3130m to settle ground rent scandal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Taylor Wimpey is to pay out up to \u00a3130m to buyers of some of its new-build leasehold properties, which were rendered near-worthless after homeowners found themselves trapped in spiralling ground rent contracts. In a statement issued at its AGM, the housebuilder said a review of the contracts, in which the ground rent doubles every 10 years, found they were legal but \u201cnot consistent with our high standards of customer service and we are sorry for the unintended financial consequence and concern that they are causing\u201d. It said it would make a provision of \u00a3130m \u201cto alter the terms of the doubling lease to materially less expensive ground rent review terms, with the group bearing the financial cost of doing so\u201d. An investigation by the Guardian last year in collaboration with campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership uncovered how buyers of Taylor Wimpey homes, predominantly in the north-west, found them to be almost unsaleable because of the doubling ground rents. One flat owner reported being trapped in a property that had been rendered virtually worthless just six years after being built. Others have been forced to pay \u00a31,000-plus fees to their freeholder for permission to build an extension, while attempts to buy out the leasehold have been met with demands of \u00a335,000 or more, even though the lease has, in some cases, hundreds of years to run. Sebastian O\u2019Kelly, of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, said: \u201cHomebuyers wanted homes and trusted a plc housebuilder. Taylor Wimpey created an investment asset class \u2013 the freehold \u2013 which it then traded to anonymous and murky investors, who hide their beneficial ownership behind nominee directors. \u201cThis ground rent racket is wealth erosion on a massive scale, which has fallen mainly on young first-time buyers and their families. It has revealed the rotten core of leasehold as a form of property tenure.\u201d But questions remain over who will benefit from the \u00a3130m put aside by Taylor Wimpey, and whether other developers will also compensate leasehold buyers. Graham Balchin, a solicitor who has acted on behalf of many homebuyers trapped in escalating ground rents, said: \u201cThere can be no doubt that the Guardian\u2019s series of articles has played a big part in generating the publicity which has in turn resulted in this change. \u201cWhile this development will come as an enormous relief for those leaseholders who bought new from Taylor Wimpey, many of these properties have changed hands since they were first sold and its statement indicates that it is only those who bought direct from Taylor Wimpey that will be helped. \u201cIf that is a correct understanding of TW\u2019s position, it will mean that there will still be thousands of TW leaseholders who will not be helped. That class of owner could therefore remain stuck with onerous ground rents in properties which will remain difficult, if not impossible to sell, at least for a price close to the value of a similar property without the onerous doubling clause.\u201d Taylor Wimpey reported profits of \u00a3733m in the year to December, up 22% on the year. Ground rents that double every 10 years have become hugely attractive to specialist investors, because they imply an interest rate of 7% a year when the Bank of England base rate is just 0.25%. Many buyers were told that the 250- or even 999-year leases on their new-build homes were \u201cvirtually freehold\u201d because of the length of the lease. But the investors who have snapped up the leases, often for just a few thousand pounds, refuse to sell them to householders unless they pay \u00a330,000 or more. In some cases they simply refuse to sell the freehold, and are not legally required to do so. Buyers have also complained that their attention was not drawn to the ground rent increases, as they were encouraged to use the conveyancing services provided by the developer. Sir Peter Bottomley, MP for Worthing West, has led the campaign against leasehold abuse in parliament. He called on other developers to match the compensation to be offered to buyers of Taylor Wimpey homes. \u201cTaylor Wimpey has recognised that leaseholders have been disadvantaged by at least \u00a3130m,\u201d Bottomley said. \u201cWhat is needed now is for all other developers to recognise their responsibilities. Developers have to rectify the impact of their past behaviour on innocent leaseholders.\u201d The scandal of escalating ground rents comes amid a surge in leasehold sales in the UK. Earlier this month, a report by the campaign group HomeOwners Alliance warned of the worsening \u201cnightmare\u201d of the leasehold system in England and Wales, saying millions of homebuyers were hostages to exorbitant bills and estimating that landlords were in line to pocket \u00a34bn from lease extensions. Leasehold, once seen as a dying relic of the Victorian property market, has returned with a vengeance since the 1990s, according to the report. In 1996, just 22% of new builds in the UK were sold as leasehold, but this has doubled to 43% at present. In London, nine out of 10 new builds are now leasehold.",

Others have been forced to pay \u00a31,000-plus fees to their freeholder for permission to build an extension, while attempts to buy out the leasehold have been met with demands of \u00a335,000 or more, even though the lease has, in some cases, hundreds of years to run. </p> <p>Sebastian O\u2019Kelly, of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, said: \u201cHomebuyers wanted homes and trusted a plc housebuilder. Taylor Wimpey created an investment asset class \u2013 the freehold \u2013 which it then traded to anonymous and murky investors, who hide their beneficial ownership behind nominee directors.</p> <p>\u201cThis ground rent racket is wealth erosion on a massive scale, which has fallen mainly on young first-time buyers and their families. It has revealed the rotten core of leasehold as a form of property tenure.\u201d</p> <p>But questions remain over who will benefit from the \u00a3130m put aside by Taylor Wimpey, and whether other developers will also compensate leasehold buyers. </p> <p>Graham Balchin, a solicitor who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/19/new-build-ground-rent-scandal-legal-battles-solicitors-negligence\">acted on behalf of many homebuyers</a> trapped in escalating ground rents, said: \u201cThere can be no doubt that the Guardian\u2019s series of articles has played a big part in generating the publicity which has in turn resulted in this change. </p> <p>\u201cWhile this development will come as an enormous relief for those leaseholders who bought new from Taylor Wimpey, many of these properties have changed hands since they were first sold and its statement indicates that it is only those who bought direct from Taylor Wimpey that will be helped. </p> <p>\u201cIf that is a correct understanding of TW\u2019s position, it will mean that there will still be thousands of TW leaseholders who will not be helped. That class of owner could therefore remain stuck with onerous ground rents in properties which will remain difficult, if not impossible to sell, at least for a price close to the value of a similar property without the onerous doubling clause.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor Wimpey reported profits of \u00a3733m in the year to December, up 22% on the year. </p> <p>Ground rents that double every 10 years have become hugely attractive to specialist investors, because they imply an interest rate of 7% a year when the Bank of England base rate is just 0.25%. </p> <p>Many buyers were told that the 250- or even 999-year leases on their new-build homes were \u201cvirtually freehold\u201d because of the length of the lease. But the investors who have snapped up the leases, often for just a few thousand pounds, refuse to sell them to householders unless they pay \u00a330,000 or more. In some cases they simply refuse to sell the freehold, and are not legally required to do so. </p> <p>Buyers have also complained that their attention was not drawn to the ground rent increases, as they were encouraged to use the conveyancing services provided by the developer. </p> <p>Sir Peter Bottomley, MP for Worthing West, has led the campaign against leasehold abuse in parliament. He called on other developers to match the compensation to be offered to buyers of Taylor Wimpey homes. </p> <p>\u201cTaylor Wimpey has recognised that leaseholders have been disadvantaged by at least \u00a3130m,\u201d Bottomley said. \u201cWhat is needed now is for all other developers to recognise their responsibilities. Developers have to rectify the impact of their past behaviour on innocent leaseholders.\u201d</p> <p>The scandal of escalating ground rents comes amid a surge in leasehold sales in the UK. Earlier this month, a report by the campaign group HomeOwners Alliance warned of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/05/leasehold-nightmare-cost-homebuyers-billions-report-warns\">worsening \u201cnightmare\u201d</a> of the leasehold system in England and Wales, saying millions of homebuyers were hostages to exorbitant bills and estimating that landlords were in line to pocket \u00a34bn from lease extensions.</p> <p>Leasehold, once seen as a dying relic of the Victorian property market, has returned with a vengeance since the 1990s, according to the report. In 1996, just 22% of new builds in the UK were sold as leasehold, but this has doubled to 43% at present. In London, nine out of 10 new builds are now leasehold.</p>",

The Paris-based thinktank said that ending payments to the wealthiest 5% to 10% would allow the government to give more to people in greater need of support. Under the current system, anyone who has paid national insurance for 30 years is eligible for the state pension, regardless of wealth. In comments reported by the Financial Times, Mark Pearson, deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs with the OECD, said that like other countries, the UK faced the rising costs of an ageing population, with more pensioners and fewer people of working age. \u201cFaced with these pressures, are you going to ask people of working age to pay more, or people to work longer before they can claim their pension? \u201cOr another way to ensure an adequate pension is to think about whether the pension should only be paid to those who really need it, to ease the tyranny of the maths. Giving less [pension] to the people at the top would free up resources to increase general benefits.\u201d Pearson said Britain\u2019s pension system was among the least generous of the OECD\u2019s 35 member countries. The basic state pension is worth \u00a36,360 a year, and the full new state pension introduced in 2016 is worth \u00a38,297 a year. \u201cThe UK pension is pretty low,\u201d he said. The state pension has become a key focus in the early stages of the general election campaign, with a refusal from Theresa May on Wednesday to rule out that a re-elected Conservative government would scrap the so-called \u201ctriple lock\u201d. Under the existing system, the basic state pension increases each year by the same as average earnings, the inflation rate or 2.5% \u2013 whichever is the highest. Tom McPhail, head of policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, rejected the OECD\u2019s idea of removing the state pension from the richest members of society. \u201cIt sounds like a pretty bad idea. If you want to take money away from the rich, the tax system is usually a better place to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has the potential to be quite socially divisive and one of the essential and valuable elements of the state pension is the reasonably clear and simple entitlement structure \u2013 if you pay your national insurance, you will qualify for it.\u201d McPhail added it would be politically unwise to start undermining the principles of the universal state pension, and could potentially exacerbate intergenerational tensions.",

The second wave of closures in just over a year means the company\u2019s branch network will more than halve to 111, although it says it will still be the biggest insurance broker on the high street. Swinton, which started selling insurance door to door 60 years ago and has 2 million customers, said it was reviewing the size and structure of its branch network. It pointed to a shift in consumer behaviour, with 90% of its customers no longer going into a branch. The firm said the fate of a call centre in Norwich that employs 183 people was also under review, and that it would begin formal consultations with all staff to be affected by the cuts. It also said that where possible they would be moved to other parts of the business. The cuts come on top of 130 branch closures announced in February last year. The closures will affect all parts of the country but most branches are in northern England. The branches employ and average of seven to eight people each. Hannah Maundrell, the editor-in-chief of money.co.uk, said: \u201cIt\u2019s sad but not surprising that Swinton are joining the many high street banks in shrinking their branch network to focus on digital and phone customers. It\u2019s not only more cost efficient for them, but it reflects how many of us are now comparing and buying insurance. \u201cThis pattern is worrying for those who aren\u2019t digitally savvy. The reality is they may end up with nowhere to turn for face-to-face help with switching insurance and end up paying more for sticking with the same policy year after year.\u201d Swinton is investing \u00a345m in its IT systems, digital and phone platforms at its new head office and call centre in Manchester to keep up with technological and regulatory changes. The firm sells motor, taxi, caravan, home and business insurance and made a pre-tax profit of \u00a318.2m in 2015, the latest accounts show.

Our approach today, which is based on a high contact strategy, no longer meets our customers\u2019 needs. \u201cWhile branches continue to be an important part of our multichannel business model, we need to ensure that we can interact with customers whenever, and however, they choose.\u201d The business began in 1957 when Ken Scowcroft sold his first car insurance policy for \u00a35 in Swinton near Manchester. At the time people bought motor insurance from salespeople at their door, but Scowcroft offered a different service by comparing prices from various insurance companies. In the first year, he sold more than 100 policies. He opened a high street branch in 1964 and by 1987 Swinton had become a well-known brand with 220 branches around the UK. More recently, the firm was embroiled in a mis-selling scandal, for which it was fined \u00a37.4m and had to pay more than \u00a311m in compensation to customers.

      "bodyText": "British car manufacturing enjoyed its best month in 17 years in March fuelled by demand for vehicles from abroad. The number of cars to roll off UK production lines rose by 7.3% last month compared with a year earlier, to 170,691 - the highest number since March 2000. Of these, 130,838 were exported, up 10.6% compared with the previous month. Demand fell at home, however, with the number of cars built for the UK market down 2.2% at 39,853, according to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). A strong March also helped to drive a 17-year quarterly high for UK production in the first three months of 2017, with 471,695 cars built, up 7.6% \u201cUK car manufacturing is accelerating thanks to billions of pounds of investment committed over the past few years,\u201d said Mike Hawes, SMMT\u2019s chief executive. He warned, however, that the current momentum could be undermined should the government fail to negotiate a free trade deal between Britain and the EU during Brexit talks. \u201cMuch of our output goes to Europe and it\u2019s vital we maintain free trade between the UK and EU or we risk destroying this success story,\u201d he said. A total of 1.7m cars were produced in Britain in 2016, and the SMMT believes the number could surpass 2m by 2020, breaking the previous record of 1.92m set in 1972. The biggest manufacturers in the UK include Japan\u2019s Nissan in Sunderland, Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover in the West Midlands and north-west, and German-owned Mini in Oxford. Hawes said a large part of the work being undertaken in the UK was on developing the latest low emission diesels vehicles. \u201cIt is essential for future growth and employment that we encourage these newer, cleaner diesels onto UK roads and avoid penalising consumers who choose diesel for its fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As Jack Dorsey, the Twitter chief executive, said he was \u201cproud to report\u201d a 14% increase in daily usage of the social media service, the shares moved higher. It\u2019s hard to understand why. Quarterly revenues fell by 8% to $548m (\u00a3427m), the first time they have dropped since Twitter became a public company in 2013. Meanwhile, profits are nowhere to be seen. In the first quarter, the company lost $62m, an $18m improvement on a year ago, thanks to cost cutting, but hardly justification for a stock market value of $11bn \u2013 less than it was, yet still substantial. \u201cWhile we continue to face revenue headwinds, we believe that executing on our plan and growing our audience should result in positive revenue growth over the long term,\u201d Dorsey said. The plan is probably the only one worth backing: get the audience up and hope revenues follow. But the current breakdown in the relationship between audience and revenues suggests Twitter\u2019s clout with advertisers is fading fast. Maybe it is being outgunned by Facebook and Google, with their vastly greater audiences and budgets. Or perhaps Twitter, despite Dorsey\u2019s many modifications, is simply less suited to commercial messages. If so, even Donald Trump\u2019s tweeting flurries, which boost the audience statistics, won\u2019t bring salvation \u2013 or a reason to value an 11-year-old company making a loss so highly. GSK\u2019s new chief takes on the \u2018perennial question\u2019 Emma Walmsley\u2019s first big call as chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline was easy to make and correct: she ruled out a breakup and committed herself to a corporate structure that houses complex pharmaceuticals, vaccines and consumer products such as toothpaste and Horlicks under one roof. In truth, nobody expected any other decision. Walmsley was an internal appointment, blessed by her predecessor Sir Andrew Witty. He spent ages deflecting calls for GSK to do the splits and she used to run the consumer division. Still, there\u2019s no harm in Walmsley addressing the \u201cperennial question\u201d, as she called it, in her first month in charge. Like Witty, she argued that reliable cashflows from vaccines and consumer products are a natural counterweight to the higher risk and more volatile business of developing pharmaceutical drugs. And she agreed that there are benefits from being able to switch prescription medicines to the consumer category when patents expire. Neither argument is 100% convincing in itself, but both are more persuasive than a disruptive separation in which the only guaranteed winners would be investment bankers and lawyers. There were no major fireworks, then, which may explain why the shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down 2%, despite first-quarter figures that showed revenue and profits marginally ahead of City forecasts. But Walmsley was clearly signalling a shakeup of some sort in pharmaceuticals with her pointed criticism that GSK has sometimes pursued \u201cinteresting\u201d drugs that lack sufficient commercial potential. Some programmes may be dropped or shoved into partnerships. Until full details are published in July, it\u2019s hard to tell whether the plan represents a tweak or a serious reform. But the market\u2019s yawn seems odd. A new CEO who talks about \u201cdisciplined choices\u201d to make the labs more commercial usually gets applause from investors. The Lloyds investigation is welcome, but a mess It is understandable that Lloyds Banking Group feels the need to answer definitively the charge that its board and executives were complacent about fraud at the Reading branch of HBOS. The bank has appointed Dame Linda Dobbs, a retired high court judge, to examine whether Lloyds handled the matter properly and met its reporting obligations after buying HBOS in 2009. The fraud, for which six people were jailed in February, ran from 2003 to 2007, but victims have long argued that Lloyds wouldn\u2019t listen to their complaints after the takeover. That allegation is serious, and an investigation is overdue. Everybody happy then? Not really. The natural investigator is the Financial Conduct Authority, which is supposedly on the job. The regulator\u2019s inquiry into HBOS Reading, which was suspended in 2013 when Thames Valley police leapt into action, reopened last month. The primary focus may be on what HBOS did under its own steam, but Lloyds\u2019 actions after it bought the ailing lender will also be under the microscope. Indeed, Lloyds will not be allowed to publish the Dobbs report or any of its findings until the FCA says so. Put another way, Lloyds has launched an \u201cindependent\u201d inquiry into itself that won\u2019t be regarded as independent or credible until the regulator allows. It\u2019s good that this affair is getting the attention it deserves, but the process is a mess.",

    "webTitle": "Fashion retailer Boohoo nearly doubles profit after celebrity Instagram tie-ups", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Boohoo, the online fashion retailer with an army of 16 to 24-year-old fans, has nearly doubled its profits, helped by paying celebrities and other \u201cinfluencers\u201d to promote its products on Instagram. The Manchester-based company, which has turned its founders into multimillionaires, reported on Wednesday that sales had risen by 51% to \u00a3295m in the year to the end of February. This pushed the retailer\u2019s pre-tax profit up by 97% to \u00a331m. Mahmud Kamani, who founded Boohoo alongside the designer and self-described \u201cproper northern lass\u201d Carol Kane in 2006, said 2016 had been a \u201cmomentous year\u201d for the company and his family. Its shares, which floated on the Aim market in 2014, have risen by more than 270%, from 50p to 186p, over the past 12 months. The retailer has a stock market value of \u00a32.1bn, more than Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct at \u00a31.7bn. The Kamani family owns 38% of the shares, worth more than \u00a3800m, while Kane owns 4.5%, worth almost \u00a3100m. Earlier this year, Boohoo expanded by buying fashion website PrettyLittleThing, which was set up by Kamani\u2019s sons Umar, Adam and Samir. The company also boosted its US presence by buying Nasty Gal, founded by the former eBay star seller Sophia Amoruso, for $20m (\u00a315.6m). Boohoo\u2019s rise has mirrored that of Asos, shares in which have increased from \u00a336 to \u00a356 over the past 12 months, as investors back large online brands. Asos is now valued at \u00a34.7bn, equal to 80% of Marks &amp; Spencer. Neil Catto, Boohoo\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company\u2019s success with mostly millennial customers had been driven by its focus on encouraging celebrities and bloggers to post about the retailer\u2019s clothes on Instagram. \u201cWe work with a whole spectrum of influencers, celebrities and wannabe bloggers \u2013 all people with a presence online \u2013 and we work with them so they can spread the word about Boohoo. It goes likes wildfire on Instagram,\u201d he said. Catto said it was hard to single out any Instagram user as delivering the most sales, but the launch of a plus-size range with the model Jordyn Woods had proved very popular. \u201cIt got a lot of buzz as she is friends with the the Kardashians,\u201d he said. He declined to say how much influential people are paid to promote the company\u2019s clothes on social media, but added that some can be encouraged to help out in return for free samples and pizza. \u201cYou can pay people to wear your clothes, or give them free clothes, [but] some are just interested in our fashion and will come along and have a pizza in our offices and put the range on Instagram,\u201d Catto said. Catto said the company\u2019s target age group was 16 to 24-year-olds, but added that 50% are older than 24, while 10% are under 16. The retailer plans further expansion in the US, where sales grew by 140% compared with 33% in the UK. Analysts at stockbroker Peel Hunt, who have a buy rating on Boohoo\u2019s shares, upgraded their 2017-18 pre-tax profit forecast to \u00a340m. \u201cWith strong trading momentum from autumn/winter likely to have provided a good start to the new season, trading updates are unlikely to disappoint and the medium-term outlook remains encouraging,\u201d they said. Kamani has vowed to focus on growing the business rather than enjoying his millions. When he cashed in more than \u00a3200m of shares in the company\u2019s flotation, his phone rang non-stop, he said. \u201cSomeone rang to ask if I wanted to buy a jet. Someone even asked if I wanted to buy a football club. I said to him: \u2018Are you on drugs?\u2019,\u201d he said at the time. Kamani inherited his love of fashion from his father, Abdullah, who sold handbags on market stalls in north-west England after leaving Kenya in the 1960s. Kamani went on to found a successful family textile business, supplying high street names such as New Look and Primark, before focusing on Boohoo. Asked why the business started in Manchester, he joked: \u201cThat\u2019s where the plane landed. London was probably an extra \u00a360.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Boohoo, the online fashion retailer with an army of 16 to 24-year-old fans, has nearly doubled its profits, helped by paying celebrities and other \u201cinfluencers\u201d to promote its products on Instagram.</p> <p>The Manchester-based company, which has turned its founders into multimillionaires, reported on Wednesday that sales had risen by 51% to \u00a3295m in the year to the end of February. This pushed the retailer\u2019s pre-tax profit up by 97% to \u00a331m. </p> <p>Mahmud Kamani, who founded Boohoo alongside the designer and self-described \u201cproper northern lass\u201d Carol Kane in 2006, said 2016 had been a \u201cmomentous year\u201d for the company and his family. Its shares, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/14/boohoo-fashion-website-float-stock-market-840m\">floated on the Aim market</a> in 2014, have risen by more than 270%, from 50p to 186p, over the past 12 months. </p> <p>The retailer has a stock market value of \u00a32.1bn, more than Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct at \u00a31.7bn.<br></p> <p>The Kamani family owns 38% of the shares, worth more than \u00a3800m, while Kane owns 4.5%, worth almost \u00a3100m. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Boohoo expanded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/boohoo-spends-33m-on-cofounders-sons-company\">buying fashion website PrettyLittleThing</a>, which was set up by Kamani\u2019s sons Umar, Adam and Samir. The company also boosted its US presence by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/28/boohoo-set-to-bid-for-us-fashion-label-nasty-gal\">buying Nasty Gal</a>, founded by the former eBay star seller Sophia Amoruso, for $20m (\u00a315.6m). </p> <p>Boohoo\u2019s rise has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/asos-plans-london-expansion-with-1500-new-staff\">mirrored that of Asos</a>, shares in which have increased from \u00a336 to \u00a356 over the past 12 months, as investors back large online brands. Asos is now valued at \u00a34.7bn, equal to 80% of Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>Neil Catto, Boohoo\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company\u2019s success with mostly millennial customers had been driven by its focus on encouraging celebrities and bloggers to post about the retailer\u2019s clothes on Instagram. </p> <p>\u201cWe work with a whole spectrum of influencers, celebrities and wannabe bloggers \u2013 all people with a presence online \u2013 and we work with them so they can spread the word about Boohoo. It goes likes wildfire on Instagram,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Catto said it was hard to single out any Instagram user as delivering the most sales, but the launch of a plus-size range with the model Jordyn Woods had proved very popular. \u201cIt got a lot of buzz as she is friends with the the Kardashians,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He declined to say how much influential people are paid to promote the company\u2019s clothes on social media, but added that some can be encouraged to help out in return for free samples and pizza. \u201cYou can pay people to wear your clothes, or give them free clothes, [but] some are just interested in our fashion and will come along and have a pizza in our offices and put the range on Instagram,\u201d Catto said. </p> <p>Catto said the company\u2019s target age group was 16 to 24-year-olds, but added that 50% are older than 24, while 10% are under 16. </p> <p>The retailer plans further expansion in the US, where sales grew by 140% compared with 33% in the UK. Analysts at stockbroker Peel Hunt, who have a buy rating on Boohoo\u2019s shares, upgraded their 2017-18 pre-tax profit forecast to \u00a340m. \u201cWith strong trading momentum from autumn/winter likely to have provided a good start to the new season, trading updates are unlikely to disappoint and the medium-term outlook remains encouraging,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Kamani has vowed to focus on growing the business rather than enjoying his millions. When he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/07/boohoo-sale-company-shares\">cashed in more than \u00a3200m</a> of shares in the company\u2019s flotation, his phone rang non-stop, he said. \u201cSomeone rang to ask if I wanted to buy a jet. Someone even asked if I wanted to buy a football club. I said to him: \u2018Are you on drugs?\u2019,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2638190/Fashion-boss-scooped-200-million-drives-seven-year-old-car.html\">he said at the time</a>. </p> <p>Kamani inherited his love of fashion from his father, Abdullah, who sold handbags on market stalls in north-west England after leaving Kenya in the 1960s. Kamani went on to found a successful family textile business, supplying high street names such as New Look and Primark, before focusing on Boohoo.</p> <p>Asked why the business started in Manchester, he joked: \u201cThat\u2019s where the plane landed. London was probably an extra \u00a360.\u201d</p>",

Edmund King, the president of the motoring organisation, has appeared on a shortlist of five entries to win the Wolfson Economics prize, this year awarded for ideas on how to fund better, more reliable roads. The submission, authored jointly with his wife, the business analyst Deirdre King, envisages a future where drivers receive an annual allowance of \u201croad miles\u201d. As well as trading them, drivers could pay for the right to travel further by entering auctions or lotteries, which would raise more income to maintain the network. Other ideas include allowing companies to name roads after themselves as an incentive for them to ensure they are pothole-free. Additional road miles would be granted to drivers with special needs and those with the cleanest, greenest vehicles, King said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of giving free access to the road network but safeguarding further revenues rather than introducing a nationwide charging system that would be political suicide,\u201d he said. The Kings are joined on the shortlist by an eclectic mix of transport planners from Australia, a Hungarian graduate and a stay-at-home mother who is expecting her third child imminently. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of the judging panel, said that the hundred-plus entries, which were submitted anonymously to judges including the former Labour chancellor and transport secretary Alistair Darling, contained some \u201cquite funky ideas\u201d, with a Harvard professor among those who had just failed to make the cut. He said the best entrants had thought deeply about the imminent technological future of autonomous cars, as well as the problem of how to fund roads with fuel and motoring taxes in long-term decline. Kingman said: \u201cThe problem of congestion is very real right now. Motorists are understandably discontented and the existing ways of paying for roads are broken. What we need is a politically viable solution which is popular and the public can see is good for them. \u201cThis is one of the great unsolved policy problems that has plagued British debates for a long time.\u201d A study by the Institute of Fiscal Studies for the RAC Foundation forecast that Treasury revenues from motorists are due to drop by more than a third to \u00a325bn by the end of the next decade, making a \u00a3250,000 award seem cheap at the price. King said they were not counting any chickens at this stage, but admitted: \u201cAn electric car, a Tesla, would be nice.\u201d The winner of the prize will be announced in July.",
