      "bodyText": "And finally.... European stock markets mostly ended the day higher, although Spain was dragged down by worries over how Catalonia\u2019s push for independence may develop. In London, the FTSE 100 closed 66 points higher at 7,438, a rise of 0.9%. Germany\u2019s DAX gained 0.6% and France\u2019s CAC rose by 0.4%. But Spain\u2019s IBEX had a bad day, losing 1.2% following Sunday\u2019s violent clashes over the disputed Catalan referendum. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The Spanish stock market is suffering after the violent images and footage that were broadcasted around the world yesterday of the Catalonian independence referendum. The use of force by police officers shocked viewers around the globe, and the heightened tensions in the region have prompted investors to cash in their positions. Opinion polls in advance of the referendum suggested that the pro-independence side were in a minority, but I suspect Madrid\u2019s actions will drive up calls for independence. The political uncertainty is weighing on their stock market, and until the situation is solved, traders will be wary. And that\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, reckons the tensions gripping Britain\u2019s Conservative Party have helped to drag the pound down today. He writes: \u201cIt has not been a Monday to remember for the pound, and the remainder of the week poses further challenges to the UK currency. \u201cThis morning\u2019s underwhelming manufacturing PMI reading could well spur a sell off, while Theresa May\u2019s premiership is coming under increasing scrutiny, and that\u2019s likely to leave the pound losing further ground. That scrutiny has been fuelled by foreign secretary Boris Johnson, with a series of interviews and speeches in recent days that have challenged May over Brexit. Yesterday, the PM was even asked whether Johnson was \u2018unsackable\u2019, following claims that he was actually trying to get the boot -- either to bolster support for a future leadership challenge, or simply because he\u2019s struggling to make ends meet on his ministerial salary (a mere \u00a3140,000....). The US economy appears to be romping ahead, if today\u2019s ISM factory survey is any guide. Capital Economics explain: The rise in the ISM manufacturing index to a 13-year high of 60.8 in September, from 58.8, is the latest illustration of the benefit to the manufacturing sector from the weaker dollar and strong global demand. The index is now, at face value, consistent with GDP growth surging above 5% annualised in the second half of this year. Over in Greece the government has tabled its first draft of the 2018 budget, in which its projects a primary surplus target of 3.5%. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Presenting the draft before the House, alternative finance minister George Chouliarakis called it the last budget Greece would experience under international supervision. Chouliarakis declared: \u201cIt is clear that this will be the last budget under a [bailout] program\u201d. The draft, which is expected to be voted on this December, foresees the debt-stricken country not only achieving a primary surplus of 3.5% next year (high by any standards) but a GDP growth rate of 2.4%. Athens\u2019 leftist-led government has said it want to make a \u201cclean exit\u201d with the country\u2019s return to markets its third international bailout programme expires next August. Greece\u2019s has been shored up to the tune of more than \u20ac300bn since its near economic collapse in 2010. Mexico\u2019s factories also had a good September. Activity grew at the fastest rate in 16 months, sending the Mexico manufacturing PMI up to 52.8 last month, from 52.2 in August. The jump in US factory growth is helping to keep Wall Street at record highs today. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 74 points, or 0.3%, to 22,479. The rally is led by Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble and Goldman Sachs, who have all gained 1%. This chart from Danske Bank shows how US manufacturing has strengthened in recent months (according to ISM, anyway). Wow! America\u2019s factory sector has posted its fastest growth in 13 years. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing activity index jumped to 60.8 in September, from 58.8 in August. Any reading over 50 shows growth. This is the fastest acceleration in 13 years, and it suggests that the US economy ended the last quarter strongly. Firms reported that new orders accelerated last month, encouraging them to take on more staff and boost production. But.... companies also experienced a big jump in material costs (as we also saw in the UK earlier). This upbeat message is backed up by Markit\u2019s rival US PMI index, released a few minutes ago. It also rose last month, but to a more modest 53.1. Canada\u2019s manufacturing sector has posted another month of solid manufacturing growth. The Canadian factory PMI has risen to 55.0, up from 54.6 in August. Factory bosses reported that output and new business growth both jumped in September, with job creation also up. Brazil\u2019s manufacturing survey is out....and it shows that the sector expanded a little in September. The Brazilian factory PMU came in at 50.9, matching August\u2019s level, which indicates slow but steady growth. Sterling has just hit a three-week low against the dollar, down 1%, or 1.3 cents at $1.3265. The pound has also shed 0.5% against the euro, to \u20ac1.128, as this morning\u2019s factory slowdown continues to weigh. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: Sterling got off to a rough start during Monday\u2019s trading session after weaker than expected data from Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector, suggested that the economy could be losing momentum. It\u2019s turning into the worst day for the pound since early June - after the last general election. Uber\u2019s UK boss, Jo Bertram, has stepped down to do something \u201cnew and exciting\u201d instead \u2013 as the ride-hailing firm fights to retain its licence to operate in London. More here. It\u2019s Conservative Party conference week! And chancellor Phillip Hammond has tried to excite delegates in Manchester by extending the Help to Buy scheme. Hammond announced that the government will provide an extra \u00a310bn to the scheme, which lets people get a loan from the government to help buy a newly build house. This will let the scheme run until 2021, Hammond said, meaning it can help an estimated 130,000 more homebuyers over the next few years. Marvellous stuff! Except, some experts reckon Help to Buy is a deeply flawed idea that pumps up house prices rather than tackling problems with supply. After all, if you don\u2019t build more houses, you\u2019ll simply have more people chasing the ones on the market. Sam Bowman, Executive Director of the Adam Smith Institute, gave the scheme a serious hoofing, saying: \u201cReviving Help to Buy is like throwing petrol onto a bonfire. The property market is totally dysfunctional because supply is so tightly constrained by planning rules, and adding more demand without improving the supply of houses is just going to raise house prices and make homes more unaffordable for people who don\u2019t qualify for the Help to Buy subsidy. Shares in Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders have jumped this morning, with Persimmon gaining 3.7% and Barratt up 3.5%. City traders have worker out that Hammond\u2019s new cash injection will boost their profits..... Sterling has made a poor start to October, falling almost one cent against the US dollar to $1.3296. The slowdown in UK factory growth last month didn\u2019t help the pound, as it has stirred concerns over the health of the wider economy. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The market never appreciates signs of a slowdown, especially when they are likely linked to the thick fog of uncertainty still surrounding Brexit. Tomorrow we get a healthcheck on Britain\u2019s construction sector, followed by the big one - the services PMI - on Wednesday. Kathleen Brooks of City Index suspects that these surveys may be underwhelming. We expect the rest of the surveys to also show signs of moderation as the UK economy enters a period of slow cooling rather than falling off a cliff. There is another factor, though. The US dollar is strengthening, on rumours that the next head of the US Federal Reserve could be Kevin Warsh. He\u2019s seen as more hawkish than Janet Yellen, the current Fed chair, so could raise interest rates more aggressively. Nicholas Megaw of the Financial Times makes a good point about the PMI -- UK firms aren\u2019t receiving enough support from the weak pound. He writes: This month\u2019s survey showed less benefit from the pound, with fewer firms reporting a boost to overseas demand while more reported an increase in cost inflation. Input price inflation hit a six-month high, with higher commodity prices and supply chain pressures also driving up costs. Here\u2019s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u2019s UK factory survey: Britain\u2019s manufacturers slowed the pace of output in September amid a rise in production costs linked to the weak pound. The Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI barometer of factory sentiment showed activity fell to 55.9 last month from 56.9 in August, as the cost of goods used in the production process increased to a six-month high. Although the reading was below City expectations, the figure is still above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. But the survey of purchasing executives in more than 600 industrial companies points to weaker growth in the UK economy. Rob Dobson, the director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: \u201cAlthough it looks as if the sector made solid progress through the third quarter as a whole, the growth slowdown in September is a further sign that momentum is being lost across the broader UK economy.\u201d While the report showed gains in new orders to be slower than in the prior month, companies reported that demand remained solid in both domestic and overseas markets. But the rising cost of commodities, and the weak pound pushing up the price of other raw materials, damaged optimism in the industrial sector. Scotiabank\u2019s Alan Clarke said the figures were disappointing but far from a weak reading on the UK economy. \u201cIn the big scheme of things, this is reasonably in keeping with what we have seen over the past year,\u201d he said. More here: Over at Luton airport, passengers who hoped to fly with Monarch Airlines today have been scrambling to find alternative flights - or going home disappointed. One was Mark Henson, 50, from Dover. He arrived at the airport at 4am for the same flight to Portugal, and was told it had been cancelled. He told Press Association: \u201cWe got told to go home: \u2018We can\u2019t help you so you may as well go home.\u2019 \u201cHe told me I wouldn\u2019t be be able to get a flight.\u201d Mr Henson was able to book two seats on a flight on Monday evening but said it was a \u201cscandal\u201d that prices on other airlines were so high. He accused companies of \u201cmoney-making\u201d out of \u201csomebody else\u2019s misery\u201d. The slowdown in factory growth may be partly due to Brexit uncertainty. Bosses will be reluctant to buy expensive new machinery until they know what trading conditions they will face from 2019. Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, says firms needs clarity: \u201cManufacturers across a range of sectors, particularly steel and oil and gas, are cashing in on sterling\u2019s fall in the last year while the UK continues to reap the benefits of the Single Market. However, businesses are not committing to long term investments and the flip side of the weaker pound is that increased input costs are weighing down on margins. \u201cThe promise of a transition deal has provided reassurance, but manufacturers are calling for negotiations to progress quickly on trade and EU workers\u2019 rights to settle the nerves on the availability of qualified overseas employees and new investment.\u201d We shouldn\u2019t be too gloomy about UK manufacturing. The sector has now racked up 14 months of growth in a row, having shrunk immediately after last year\u2019s EU referendum. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, says UK factories are struggling to meet orders because they\u2019ve failed to invest in new equipment: Emerging problems in the supply chain, signalled by lengthening lead times, are likely related to the subdued investment performance of the past few quarters. Companies will only satisfy some of their capacity needs through additional recruitment which needs to be complemented with higher capital spend on productivity enhancing investment. With the demand outlook holding up, government action in the forthcoming Budget to spur companies to commit to investment in the UK will be a priority.\u201d Worryingly, some UK factories are struggling to deliver their orders in time due to supply shortages, according to the PMI report. Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains: \u201cThe biggest news this month is the fall in the productivity of manufacturing supply chains as suppliers lost the fight to keep on top of promised delivery times and their performance weakened to the greatest extent for six-and-a-half years. The blame lay squarely at the feet of capacity constraints and some commodity shortages in food, but also other materials such as plastics and steel. British factories will probably be forced to pass their higher raw material costs onto consumers, which could push UK inflation even higher. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, warns: With cost pressures remaining elevated and margins being increasingly squeezed, it\u2019s only a matter of time before manufacturers raise prices which will likely impact the domestic demand that has been fuelling growth in the sector.\u201d The drop in the UK factory PMI in September suggests Britain\u2019s economy is losing momentum, warns Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit. He says: \u201cThe latest PMI survey showed a modest deceleration in the rates of expansion in UK manufacturing production and new orders. Although it looks as if the sector made solid progress through the third quarter as a whole, the growth slowdown in September is a further sign that momentum is being lost across the broader UK economy. Exports remain a bright spot, however, still rising at one of the strongest rates over the past six-and-a-half years. Dobson also warns that rising commodity prices and the weak pound will continue to drive import costs up. That will \u201cdent profitability and potentially disrupt production schedules in coming months\u201d. Just in: UK factory growth slowed last month, as Britain failed to match the eurozone\u2019s strong performance. The UK\u2019s factory PMI , which measures activity across the sector, fell to 55.9 in September, from August\u2019s 56.7. That is weaker than the City expected, and shows that the sector expanded at a more modest rate. Encouragingly, the survey found the new exports remained solid. Data firm Markit says: Growth of new export business remained among the best registered over the past six-and-a-half years. There were reports of increased sales to Europe, the USA, China and Brazil. Some firms also mentioned an ongoing boost from the historical weakness of sterling, although this was less prominent as a factor than earlier in the year But firms were also hit by higher costs, with input price inflation hitting its highest rate since March. That\u2019s due to rising commodity prices and the knock-on impact of the pound\u2019s fall last year (which is still rippling through the economy). Reaction to follow.... Breaking! The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector has posted its best month since early 2011. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit, whose euro area factory PMI has jumped to 58.1, the highest in six and a half years. That\u2019s up from August\u2019s 57.4, and shows that the sector grew strongly (any reading over 50 shows an expansion). Factory bosses reported that new orders piled in last month, mainly from overseas customers. That encouraged them to take on new staff, at the fastest rate since Markit started tracking the sector two decade ago. The recovery was pretty broad-based too, with Germany and the Netherlands recording the strongest growth. Encouragingly, Greek factories also reported growth, at the fastest rate in almost a decade. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, reckons the recovery could continue for some time.... The eurozone manufacturing boom kicked into an even higher gear in September..... \u201cSurging order book growth has encouraged manufacturers to take on extra staff at a rate never previously seen in the 20-year history of the PMI survey. Despite this expansion of capacity, backlogs of incomplete work built up at a faster rate, suggesting that the hiring upturn has plenty more room to run. Over in Madrid, shares have fallen following yesterday\u2019s referendum in Catalonia, and the violent clashes between Spanish police and those trying to take part. Catalonian president Carles Puigdemont has indicated that the region could declare independence after Sunday\u2019s poll, even though the vote had already been declared illegal by Spain\u2019s constitutional court. Catalan officials say 90% of votes were cast in favour of independence, although the turnout was only 42.3% [it might have been higher if Spanish police hadn\u2019t disrupted the vote, dragged people out by the hair and fired rubber bullet at crowds protecting poling stations]. With the next step uncertain, bank shares led the selloff in Spain - knocking almost 1% off the IBEX index. Spanish government bonds have also been hit, pushing the gap between Spain\u2019s borrowing costs and Germany\u2019s close to a four-month high. The Unite union has accused Theresa May\u2019s government of \u2018sitting on its hands\u2019 and allowing Monarch to fail. Monarch needed help due to terror attacks in Egypt and Tunisia, which encouraged more rivals to compete on its Spanish roots. The \u201cdecimation\u201d of the tourist trade in Turkey was another crucial factor. But Unite argues that Monarch could have kept flying if ministers had given it a \u2018bridging loan\u2019, to cover the cost of restructuring its business. After all, Angela Merkel provided Air Berlin with credit lines in August when it fell into insolvency, preventing its collapse. National officer Oliver Richardson says Britain should learn from Germany\u2019s example: Continuing uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the ability of UK airlines to fly freely in Europe after the UK has left the EU undoubtedly hindered Monarch getting the investment it needed to restructure and survive. \u201cThis uncertainty, combined with the apparent unwillingness of the Government to assist at commercial rates and at a profit to the taxpayer, has left thousands of jobs at a great British airline hanging by a thread. \u201cNow is not the time for Government ministers to wash their hands of a problem they have contributed to. \u201cMinisters need to act fast by intervening in a similar way as their German counterparts did with Air Berlin and help secure a future for Monarch.\u201d Monarch\u2019s unhappy demise is good news for its rivals, including Ryanair, which is going through its own crisis right now (having cancelled flights due to a lack of pilots). Shares in easyJet have jumped by 5% at the start of trading, while BA\u2019s parent company, IAG, are up 2%. Ryanair\u2019s share are up over 3%. Following Monarch\u2019s collapse at 4am, the Civil Aviation Authority is now conducting the \u201cbiggest ever peacetime repatriation\u201d in UK history. Two flights from Ibiza have already landed this morning, at Gatwick and Birmingham, but that still leaves over 100,000 people abroad. Anyone who arrives at a UK airport hoping to fly with Monarch Airlines will be disappointed today: Here\u2019s our Q&amp;A on what they should do: UK manufacturers fear they could lose \u00a317bn per year in European sales if Britain leaves the EU under a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019. That\u2019s according to a new report from top law firm Baker McKenzie, which examines the implications of Britain defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules. It found that Britain\u2019s Automotive, Technology, Healthcare and Consumer Goods businesses would all suffer if new tariffs were imposed. Crucially, those four sectors export almost half their products to the UK; while the UK accounts for just 9% of exports from the EU. That implies Britain would suffer more than the UK under a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 scenario. But can\u2019t Britain just export more to China, the US, Korea, etc?... ....Yes, but this report reckons that UK exports to five key markets need to increase by 60% to offset \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 EU export loss. Baker McKenzie Trade partner Jenny Revis says: \u201cThese figures indicate the extent to which the UK\u2019s key manufacturing sectors are likely to be hit by the impact of a hard Brexit. You can understand why there is now mounting pressure for the UK to negotiate new customs arrangements for post Brexit trade with the EU and for companies to work with their industry groups to help shape future trading relations with the EU.\u201d The report also questions whether German car makers, for example, would push chancellor Angela Merkel to give the UK a good Brexit deal (as some commentators claim). While Britain does buy a lot of German cars -- Britain is simply a less important market to Europe than Europe is to Britain, as this chart shows: This may give Brussels the upper hand in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, warns Ross Denton of Baker McKenzie: \u201cWe have heard a lot about how much Europe exports to the UK, for example, in the automotive sector. \u201cThat may be true in numerical terms, but when you look at this as a percentage of their trade, you can clearly see that the EU exports a lot more broadly, to a whole host of other markets, and consequently, it is far less dependant on the UK as a market than the UK is on it. This will have significant implications for upcoming negotiations.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how Britain\u2019s factories performed last month, as data firm IHS Markit publishes its health check on manufacturers across the globe. Economists expect the UK factory PMI to drop to 56.2, from last month\u2019s 56.9. That would indicate that growth slowed a little but remains solid (anything over 50 shows growth). Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities says the figures could hit sterling. The pound will be making headlines as well as the PMI figures from all 3 sectors of the domestic economy are pending for release over the next few days. Today the release of the Manufacturing figures will set the stage and analysts are expecting a softer reading which could dampen expectations for a stronger pound in October. The British currency saw a strong performance during September following renewed bullishness from the Bank of England that suggested that a higher interest rate policy might be needed to arrest the rallying inflation. A flurry of PMIs from across the world will also show how the global economy fared in September. The other big news this morning is that Britain\u2019s fifth-biggest airline, Monarch, has collapsed overnight leaving 110,000 holidaymakers stranded overseas. It\u2019s the biggest collapse of a UK airline ever, according to the Civil Aviation Authority, and means 300,000 bookings have also been cancelled. The UK is now scrambling to arrange new flight to get people home. The CAA chief executive, Andrew Haines, says: \u201cWe are putting together, at very short notice and for a period of two weeks, what is effectively one of the UK\u2019s largest airlines to manage this task. The scale and challenge of this operation means that some disruption is inevitable. We ask customers to bear with us as we work around the clock to bring everyone home.\u201d European traders will also be watching events in Spain closely, following the disturbing scenes of violence in Catalonia yesterday Here\u2019s the agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for September 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for September 10am BST: Eurozone unemployment report for August 2.30pm BST: Canadian manufacturing PMI for September 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI for September",

      "bodyText": "When former chancellor George Osborne launched his help to buy housing scheme in 2013, wise heads warned that, once a government starts subsidising mortgages, it will find it hard to stop. So it is proving. Another \u00a310bn is to be thrown at help to buy, the government has said in a supposedly crowd-pleasing announcement. This is a 50% increase on the sum already spent. City analysts calculate it will take until 2027 for all the money to be distributed. For as far as the eye can see, help to buy is here to stay. On the evidence since 2013, the only guaranteed beneficiaries will be housebuilders. With a prop under house prices, their profit margins have returned to the 25% mark. Returns on capital are fatter in many cases. Yet this lovely cash hasn\u2019t fuelled a golden era of housebuilding. Instead, the companies are returning their \u201csurplus capital\u201d to shareholders. Top executives, incentivised to do exactly that, are becoming richer than pre-crash bankers. It isn\u2019t even obvious that first-time buyers, as a group, have gained much. The ability to buy a new home with a 5% deposit is of questionable benefit if the price of the house has been artificially inflated and the government\u2019s \u201cinterest free\u201d portion of the mortgage doesn\u2019t last forever. Back in 2013, Osborne had excuse of sorts \u2013 he could plead that the banks were still in post-crash recovery mode. By contrast, the Bank of England these days frets about too much credit in the system, not too little. The situation cries out for imaginative policies to boost the supply of housing \u2013 especially regeneration projects. Another sugary serving of help to buy will do nothing to improve the underlying problem. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let this scheme turn into a permanent scheme,\u201d warned Lord King, governor of the Bank when help to buy was launched. His argument was that the policy was \u201ca little too close for comfort to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages\u201d. Too late now. Help to buy has acquired a life of its own and no politician dares to stand in its way. Monarch cash injection should never have taken off The collapse of an airline is always shocking for customers and staff, but you will struggle to find many industry-watchers who are surprised by the failure of Monarch. The \u00a3165m funding injection a year ago by owner Greybull Capital \u2013 \u201cthe largest investment in our 48-year history,\u201d crowed Monarch chief executive Andrew Swaffield \u2013 always looked to be a case of hope triumphing over experience. Greybull, remember, had already invested \u00a375m in 2014. Last year\u2019s big plan involved Monarch ordering fuel-efficient aircraft from Boeing but required the business to stay aloft until the new planes arrived, which wasn\u2019t scheduled to start until next year. In perfect flying conditions, it might have worked. In the airline game, however, nothing ever runs perfectly. Currency movements, terrorist incidents, fuel prices, strikes by air-traffic controllers are constant business risks. All four factors played a role at Monarch but the underlying cause is simply that easyJet and Ryanair are bigger, better-capitalised, more efficient and more able to ride the upsets. Ryanair, by cancelling so many flights, may be guilty of running itself too leanly, but it still a business that is expected to make after-tax profits this year of \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.2bn). Air Berlin and Alitalia couldn\u2019t live with the price competition. It\u2019s no surprise that Monarch couldn\u2019t either. The only mystery is why Greybull was so optimistic a year ago. Tesco\u2019s fake farm wheeze comes home to roost Tesco\u2019s introduction of fictitious British-style farm names was chief executive Dave Lewis\u2019s finest hour, marketing folk used to agree. The wheeze looks less clever after the investigation by this paper and ITV showed packs of Lidl drumsticks being opened at 2 Sisters\u2019 poultry plant and being repackaged for Tesco under its Willow Farms brand. The supermarket has since said it made a mistake when it described its Willow Farm chicken as reared exclusively for Tesco. It was the made-up brand that was supposed to be exclusive, not the product. The company apologised to customers for \u201cany confusion\u201d. But surely the whole fake farms project was designed to confuse? It suggests precise sourcing, or least supreme confidence about provenance. Lewis would be wise to address the question when he presents Tesco\u2019s interim results on Wednesday. The \u201cevery Lidl helps\u201d gag is catching on.",

Top executives, incentivised to do exactly that, are becoming richer than pre-crash bankers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/29/london-house-prices-fall-for-first-time-in-eight-years-as-rest-of-uk-rises\">London house prices fall for first time in eight years as rest of UK rises</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It isn\u2019t even obvious that first-time buyers, as a group, have gained much. The ability to buy a new home with a 5% deposit is of questionable benefit if the price of the house has been artificially inflated and the government\u2019s \u201cinterest free\u201d portion of the mortgage doesn\u2019t last forever.</p> <p>Back in 2013, Osborne had excuse of sorts \u2013 he could plead that the banks were still in post-crash recovery mode. By contrast, the Bank of England these days frets about too much credit in the system, not too little. The situation cries out for imaginative policies to boost the supply of housing \u2013 especially regeneration projects. Another sugary serving of help to buy will do nothing to improve the underlying problem.</p> <p>\u201cWe mustn\u2019t let this scheme turn into a permanent scheme,\u201d warned Lord King, governor of the Bank when help to buy was launched. His argument was that the policy was \u201ca little too close for comfort to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages\u201d. Too late now. Help to buy has acquired a life of its own and no politician dares to stand in its way.</p> <h2>Monarch cash injection should never have taken off</h2> <p>The collapse of an airline is always shocking for customers and staff, but you will struggle to find many industry-watchers who are surprised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/02/monarch-airlines-flights-cancelled-as-airline-goes-into-administration\">the failure of Monarch</a>.</p> <p>The \u00a3165m funding injection a year ago by owner Greybull Capital \u2013 \u201cthe largest investment in our 48-year history,\u201d crowed Monarch chief executive Andrew Swaffield \u2013 always looked to be a case of hope triumphing over experience. Greybull, remember, had already invested \u00a375m in 2014.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s big plan involved Monarch ordering fuel-efficient aircraft from Boeing but required the business to stay aloft until the new planes arrived, which wasn\u2019t scheduled to start until next year. In perfect flying conditions, it might have worked. In the airline game, however, nothing ever runs perfectly. Currency movements, terrorist incidents, fuel prices, strikes by air-traffic controllers are constant business risks.</p> <p>All four factors played a role at Monarch but the underlying cause is simply that easyJet and Ryanair are bigger, better-capitalised, more efficient and more able to ride the upsets. Ryanair, by cancelling so many flights, may be guilty of running itself too leanly, but it still a business that is expected to make after-tax profits this year of \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.2bn).</p> <p>Air Berlin and Alitalia couldn\u2019t live with the price competition. It\u2019s no surprise that Monarch couldn\u2019t either. The only mystery is why Greybull was so optimistic a year ago.</p> <h2>Tesco\u2019s fake farm wheeze comes home to roost </h2> <p>Tesco\u2019s introduction of fictitious British-style farm names was chief executive Dave Lewis\u2019s finest hour, marketing folk used to agree. The wheeze looks less clever after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/28/uks-top-supplier-of-supermarket-chicken-fiddles-food-safety-dates\">the investigation by this paper and ITV</a> showed packs of Lidl drumsticks being opened at 2 Sisters\u2019 poultry plant and being repackaged for Tesco under its Willow Farms brand.</p> <p>The supermarket has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/29/tesco-admits-error-over-repackaging-of-returned-lidl-chicken\">said it made a mistake</a> when it described its Willow Farm chicken as reared exclusively for Tesco. It was the made-up brand that was supposed to be exclusive, not the product. The company apologised to customers for \u201cany confusion\u201d.</p> <p>But surely the whole fake farms project was designed to confuse? It suggests precise sourcing, or least supreme confidence about provenance. Lewis would be wise to address the question when he presents Tesco\u2019s interim results on Wednesday. The \u201cevery Lidl helps\u201d gag is catching on.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has denied that Monarch Airlines customers should have been warned of the carrier\u2019s financial troubles in the runup to its collapse, as an operation began to repatriate 110,000 passengers. Asked whether travellers should have been notified about over the problems \u2013 flights were still on sale at the weekend \u2013 a Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cThis was a decision made by the company and it is the job of directors and their advisers to decide when a business is no longer a going concern \u2026 It is the not the role of government to decide on the viability of a business.\u201d The DfT defended its actions as the Civil Aviation Authority, the airline industry watchdog, revealed it had been putting together contingency plans over the last four and a half weeks, but only had a \u201cclear indication\u201d that the UK\u2019s fifth largest airline was about to go into administration late on Saturday night. Monarch\u2019s administrators also revealed on Monday evening that more than 1,800 staff had been made redundant following the collapse. Monarch passengers at Luton airport said they had checked in for their flights on Sunday, just before administrators grounded the airline at 4am on Monday. Hazel Henson, 47, said: \u201cWe checked in yesterday and when we got here this morning, just after 4am, my husband got an email saying, \u2018Thank you for checking in.\u2019\u201d Henson said her husband had paid about \u00a3270 for replacement flights with easyJet after airport staff initially told them to go home.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to ruin our holiday, and that\u2019s why my husband has paid for more flights.\u201d The CAA said 110,000 customers would be brought home on specially chartered planes and a further 750,000 learned that their bookings have been cancelled. The 4am announcement that Britain\u2019s longest-surviving airline brand had been placed into administration meant that many passengers arrived at airports on Monday morning to find their flights cancelled and their holiday plans in tatters. Monarch\u2019s administrators confirmed on Monday night that 1,858 of the airline\u2019s 2,100 employees had lost their jobs. \u201cRegrettably, with the business no longer able to fly, a significant number of redundancies were made,\u201d said joint administrator Blair Nimmo. The first of more than 700 flights home in a \u00a360m operation for the Civil Aviation Authority landed on Monday at Gatwick airport, carrying Monarch customers from Ibiza. The regulator has chartered 34 planes, including from easyJet and Qatar Airways, for the repatriation from destinations across Europe. It said all customers due to return to the UK in the next two weeks \u2013 even those without bookings protected under the Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence (Atol) scheme \u2013 would be flown home at no extra cost and did not need to cut short their stay. The CAA chief executive, Andrew Haines, said: \u201cThis is the biggest UK airline ever to cease trading, so the government has asked the CAA to support Monarch customers currently abroad to get back to the UK at the end of their holiday at no extra cost to them. \u201cWe are putting together, at very short notice and for a period of two weeks, what is effectively one of the UK\u2019s largest airlines to manage this task. We ask customers to bear with us as we work round the clock to bring everyone home.\u201d Customers affected by the company\u2019s collapse were urged to check the dedicated website monarch.caa.co.uk for advice and information on flights back to the UK. The CAA said passengers would be brought home on flights as close as possible to their original times, dates and destination, but some consolidation, disruption and delay was inevitable. Most are due to travel through Spanish airports, with 32,000 set to return this week from Spain and its islands, including more than 6,000 from Alicante and Malaga, and almost 5,300 from Palma de Mallorca and 4,400 from Tenerife. Nearly 10,000 people will be flown back by Friday from Portugal, the majority from Faro. But passengers yet to travel could could be hit harder. Haines said it was a \u201cvery mixed picture\u201d for the 300,000 outstanding bookings, affecting a total of 750,000 customers due to leave the UK in the coming weeks and months. He said close to 50% of Monarch passengers were believed to have some form of Atol protection, and Haines said most of the others should receive refunds on their flights through credit or debit card providers. However, customers who booked accommodation separately may struggle to reclaim their other holiday costs, with many travel insurers excluding airline failure from their policies. Commenting on the \u201cextraordinary operation\u201d, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said: \u201cThis is a hugely distressing situation for British holidaymakers abroad \u2013 and my first priority is to help them get back to the UK. That is why I have immediately ordered the country\u2019s biggest ever peacetime repatriation to fly about 110,000 passengers who could otherwise have been left stranded abroad.\u201d The taxpayer will meet the initial cost of the repatriation, although the government hopes to recoup much of that sum from the Atol protection scheme and credit card payment companies. Monarch, whose headquarters are at London Luton airport, was founded in 1968. It operates from four other UK bases \u2013 London Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds Bradford \u2013 travelling to more than 40 destinations around the world. The company employs about 2,750 predominantly UK-based staff, and all but about 600 people working in its engineering division, MAEL, will be affected. Monarch enjoyed a good reputation for customer service, but its long-term future rarely looked assured. In 2014, its Swiss family owners sold the company to the investment firm Greybull Capital, a deal that resulted in airline staff being forced to agree to pay cuts. Greybull said the airline had been \u201cbuffeted by factors outside of its control\u201d. Terrorism and the collapse of the pound after the Brexit vote were the two main factors, it said. Two of Monarch\u2019s biggest markets, in Egypt and Tunisia, were closed to tourists after terrorist attacks. The Foreign Office advised against travel to Tunisia and Egypt\u2019s Red Sea resorts after the shooting in Sousse and the bombing of a Russian airliner in 2015, stopping charter flights from the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Adani\u2019s ambitions face a grave new risk in Australia, where its grip on its only operating asset, a Queensland coal port, is threatened by a crash in income unless its contentious Carmichael mine becomes a reality, a new report says. Adani must refinance more than $2bn in debt on the Abbot Point coal terminal \u2013 more than it paid for the port in 2011 \u2013 despite earning $1.2bn in revenue and paying virtually no tax in Australia since, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. And Adani must gain fresh lender backing at a time when the port faces plummeting revenue that only its $5bn mine proposal, itself yet to secure finance, can make up for, the analysis says. IEEFA\u2019s analysis was included in an ABC Four Corners program on Adani on Monday that also featured a former Indian environment minister saying he was \u201cappalled\u201d by Australia\u2019s approval of the mine. Jairam Ramesh told the program Adani\u2019s environmental history in India \u201cleaves a lot to be desired\u201d and questioned whether the Australian and Queensland governments had properly considered this or its financial conduct, including allegations of large-scale fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to believe that Adani would be a responsible environmental player globally,\u201d he said. The IEEFA report found new links between Adani\u2019s Australian corporate structures and a Caribbean tax haven, the port in particular having a \u201ccomplex and opaque ownership structure [that] appears well-suited to minimising tax\u201d. It was previously thought that local companies relating to Abbot Point and a proposed rail link with the Carmichael mine \u2013 for which Adani is seeking a concessional loan of up to $900m from Australian taxpayers \u2013 were owned by an Adani family company in the Cayman Islands, Atulya Resources Limited. But Singapore corporate filings show Atulya is owned by another Adani family company in the British Virgin Islands, ARFT Holding Ltd. And two trusts related to the Carmichael rail project are potentially held by another BVI-registered company called Carmichael Rail Australia Ltd, according to the IEEFA analysis. One of the trusts holds a $2/tonne royalty deed that would net the Adani family income from the Carmichael mine, which is expected to yield up to 60m tonnes a year. Contracts that force Abbot Point\u2019s coalmining customers to pay for using the port\u2019s full capacity have begun to expire, with the port actually running at just over half its capacity as the bullish predictions of a coal boom gave way to a downturn. To refinance the port, Adani needed to \u201cconvince financiers that [Abbot Point] will be fully utilised into the future\u201d with its own Carmichael mine the only candidate to pick up this looming shortfall of about 25 million tonnes a year, IEEFA said. The port thus ran \u201cthe risk of becoming a stranded asset\u201d if the Carmichael mine, itself a $5bn greenfield project that represented a \u201chigh-risk gamble\u201d, did not secure financial backing overseas, it said. IEEFA\u2019s Tim Buckley told Four Corners a potential $1.5bn loss on any decision to walk away from the mine proposal explained why the Adani Group remained focused on securing Australian taxpayer support through a Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility loan. \u201cTo the extent able to be analysed from Asic records, Adani\u2019s entire mine, rail and port operation in Australia looks to be 100% debt-financed and shareholders\u2019 funds now tally an unprecedented negative-$458m combined,\u201d he said. \u201cThe value at stake for the Adani Group\u2019s Carmichael mine proposal is far bigger than previously understood.\u201d Abbot Point must refinance $1.48bn by November 2018 and cumulative debt of $2.11bn by 2020. The first of seven payments of $85m each to the State Bank of India (SBI) for the port was due last Friday. SBI in 2013 blocked the sale of Adani\u2019s port companies to private Adani family companies in tax havens, insisting these seven payments had to be made first. IEEFA noted that while Adani\u2019s debt from Abbot Point rose to more than $2bn from the $1.83bn it paid in 2011, it had also given $182m in loans to the Adani family\u2019s Carmichael rail proposal and $52m to the family\u2019s proposal for a new terminal at Abbot Point, since postponed. Buckley\u2019s report co-author, Adam Walters, said the port companies had effectively taken out extra debt to \u201cprop up\u201d the family-owned proposals. Walters said a range of major Australian banks including the Commonwealth Bank had \u201cheavy exposure\u201d through lending for Abbot Point but it was not clear if any had since on-sold the debt to other institutions. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, on Monday defended the \u201cstrict environmental conditions\u201d attached to Adani\u2019s project, including the postponed port expansion. \u201cWe stopped the dumping of dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d she told reporters. Adani responded by saying it operated within the law and defended its environmental record, citing cases before India\u2019s supreme court. \u201cAdani Group adhere to the laws of the land in which we operate, be it India or any other of the 50 geographies we work in,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot be held to either ransom or blackmail by media organisations that indulge into sensationalism without any basis and contrary to facts.\u201d",

Nissan and one of the UK\u2019s biggest challenger energy suppliers, Ovo, will offer the \u201cvehicle-to-grid\u201d service to buyers of the Japanese carmaker\u2019s new Leaf from next year. After installing a special charger in a customer\u2019s home, the supplier will take over the management of the car\u2019s battery, with owners able to set a minimum amount of charge they want for driving the next day. Ovo will then automatically trade electricity from the battery, topping it up during off-peak periods when power costs about 4p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and selling it at peak times for about four times as much. The Ovo chief executive, Stephen Fitzpatrick, said the savings would cover the \u00a3350-\u00a3400 annual cost of charging an electric car. \u201cBeing able to feed back into the grid will mean that customers will be able to drive for free,\u201d he said. There are about 100,000 plug-in cars in the UK, but National Grid has warned their rapid growth will require the equivalent of a few new nuclear power stations. However, the cars\u2019 batteries could also help energy networks cope with the increasing but variable wind and solar power on the system, by returning power to the grid at times of peak demand and smoothing out inconsistencies in energy supply. The government recently launched a \u00a320m fund for research into such vehicle-to-grid technology, which has previously been confined to private pilots, but will now be open to consumers. Fitzpatrick predicted that while the technology would initially have a \u201crelatively modest\u201d impact on the take-up of electric vehicles and easing pressure on the grid, it was \u201cthe thin end of a very important wedge\u201d. In future, the flexibility provided by allowing power grid managers to draw on millions of electric cars would be \u201ctransformational\u201d, he said. As well as avoiding the need for costly grid upgrades, paid for through energy bills, it could reduce the number of new power stations that need to be built, Fitzpatrick added. Nissan and Ovo have also collaborated to sell a \u00a34,800 home battery system to households with solar power, similar to the Powerwall made by Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla. The battery is pitched as a way for buyers to make more money from their solar panels, and Ovo will pay owners about \u00a3350 a year for allowing it to offer services to the power grid.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers are showing signs of a slowdown in growth, as the boost to exporters from the weak pound is offset by rising production costs and fears over Brexit. Sterling\u2019s depreciation was widely expected to benefit manufacturers as their goods become more competitively priced for foreign buyers. However the cost of imported materials used in the production process has also risen, hitting a six-month high last month, according to a closely watched barometer of factory sentiment. The Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI index showed activity fell to 55.9 last month from 56.7 in August, as firms were hit by the rising cost of commodities. There was also a shortage of some materials such as plastics and steel. Although the reading was below City expectations, the figure is still above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. But the survey of purchasing executives in more than 600 industrial companies points to weaker growth in the UK economy. Rob Dobson, the director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: \u201cAlthough it looks as if the sector made solid progress through the third quarter as a whole, the growth slowdown in September is a further sign that momentum is being lost across the broader UK economy.\u201d While the report showed gains in new orders to be slower than in the prior month, companies reported that demand remained solid in both domestic and overseas markets. But the rising cost of commodities, and the weak pound pushing up the price of other raw materials, damaged optimism in the industrial sector. Scotiabank\u2019s Alan Clarke said the figures were disappointing but far from a weak reading on the UK economy. \u201cIn the big scheme of things, this is reasonably in keeping with what we have seen over the past year,\u201d he said. Similar to other increasingly globalised economies, the UK manufacturing sector has expanded its use of materials sourced overseas in recent years. While this can help reduce production costs, it exposes factories to risks arising from movements in sterling. Sterling remains 10% below its level before the Brexit vote. Official data on Friday showed the UK economy grew at a slower pace than first thought in July, putting Britain at the bottom of the G7 growth table just as the Bank of England looks ready to raise the cost of borrowing for the first time in a decade. The weak reading from the manufacturing sector may discourage the Bank from hiking the cost of borrowing. Threadneedle Street will be looking at other data over the coming month before its monetary policy committee makes a decision on interest rates in November. The state of the Brexit negotiations, where progress has been slow, has been putting businesses off investing in their UK operations. Recent readings on economic growth showed investment by companies to be flat in the second quarter. However, some are putting money into the UK economy, as the weak pound makes British products more competitive on the global market. The automotive supplier Brose, which employs about 1,000 people at two factories in Coventry, is opening a new \u00a310m paint plant with the creation of about 30 new jobs. The German-owned company\u2019s plant will be able to paint about 3.5m seats a year for UK customers, including those of Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and Toyota. \u201cBrose is committed to growing our UK operation,\u201d said Juergen Zahl, the managing director of its UK arm. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, could use his forthcoming budget to boost business investment, according to Lee Hopley, the chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation. \u201cGovernment action in the forthcoming budget to spur companies to commit to investment in the UK will be a priority,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, the eurozone is leaping ahead. IHS Markit\u2019s manufacturing PMI for the single currency bloc hit a record high for September, as conditions strengthened to the greatest extent in over six and a half years. The survey came in for 58.1 in the eurozone, slightly below expectations among economists. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy, said: \u201cUK manufacturers are riding on the coat-tails of their counterparts in the booming eurozone, but they increasingly are being held back by weak domestic demand.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Monarch, Britain\u2019s longest-surviving airline brand, has gone into administration, leaving all flights grounded with 110,000 passengers abroad. The government has asked the Civil Aviation Authority to initiate a large repatriation operation but a further 300,000 customers with future bookings have had their flights and holiday plans cancelled. What caused the crisis at Monarch and what should passengers expect now? Are 110,000 passengers really stranded? No. The government has made clear that all Monarch customers abroad will be repatriated, with about 700 flights to be specially chartered over the next fortnight, at no further cost,. But some may experience some disruption or amendments to their original travel plans. The CAA has taken over Monarch\u2019s website and has provided information for passengers abroad, who can also ring a Department for Transport helpline on +44 1753 330 330. What about people who booked a future flight or holiday? How do they get their money back or rebook? There is no immediate substitute or process for rebooking; flights are simply cancelled. If a holiday was booked through Monarch Holidays or another holiday firm or travel agent, it should be Atol protected and refundable. If a flight was booked direct with Monarch Airlines after 15 December 2016, it was not Atol protected. However, the CAA believes most people should eventually be able to reclaim at least what they paid for their flight, through a section 75 or chargeback claim with their credit or debit card provider. But people who booked accommodation or car hire separately may struggle to recoup all costs depending on their payment method and insurance. The CAA has full information here and passengers in the UK can also call a DfT helpline on 0300 303 2800; the travel association Abta also has information here. What role did Brexit play in Monarch\u2019s failure? Monarch had been struggling for years. It was kept aloft in 2014 through pay cuts and redundancies when taken over by the investment firm Greybull Capital, but the EU referendum and associated fall in the pound was a hammer blow. The decline in sterling left Monarch paying \u00a350m a year more for its fuel and aircraft \u2013 airlines\u2019 biggest costs, paid for in the international market in dollars. Sterling has fallen 10% against dollar since the referendum and more than 12% against the euro. Monarch had also placed an order for Boeing 737 Max planes worth more than $3bn, again to be paid for in dollars. More broadly, British holidaymakers were deterred from travelling by the weak pound and fares fell. Uncertainty around Brexit, including fundamental questions over whether British carriers will still have the right to operate freely in Europe, is said to have deterred potential buyers from rescuing Monarch. Was terrorism a major factor? This was perhaps the biggest difficulty Monarch faced, with the carrier being above all a leisure airline operating routes to the sun. One of its most important markets was the Red Sea, but all travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, a year-round sun destination, was stopped after the 2015 bombing of a Russian Metrojet airliner. Monarch also had to stop operating services to Tunisia after the shootings at Sousse in 2015. Monarch\u2019s collapse follows the failure of Air Berlin and Alitalia, so will we see more airlines go bust? The three carriers most likely to fail have now done so. But in general, industry observers have warned of too much capacity in the market: good news for passengers in the short term with lower fares, even for summer holiday flights, but unsustainable for many businesses. The pressure on airlines eased while the price of oil was low, but others may yet struggle. What will happen to Monarch\u2019s assets such as its planes and landing slots? Administrators said there have been no realistic offers for the airline as a whole, but easyJet is believed to be interested in parts of it, especially landing slots that would allow it to offer more flights out of Gatwick and Luton. IAG, the owner of British Airways, and Wizz Air may also be interested in buying landing slots. Monarch\u2019s leased planes are currently unable to fly due to the administration process. Will Monarch leave a big hole in the holiday market and will prices rise as a result? Prices may well rise, although Monarch, despite its longevity, remains a comparatively small player in the overall market. Competition concerns may exist over easyJet\u2019s interest in some of the airline\u2019s assets.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has ordered big lenders in the UK to find \u00a3116bn of funding as part of a series of measures to ensure that taxpayers will never again have to bail out the banking sector. Threadneedle Street also intends to publish details of how each of the big lenders would cope in the event they find themselves in a situation similar to Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, which needed \u00a365bn of taxpayer bailouts almost a decade ago. Sir Jon Cunliffe, the deputy governor at the Bank responsible for financial stability, said regulators needed to let banks fail in a similar way that traditional companies collapse. This has not been possible in the past because of the risk that savers lose their funds and because a system did not exist to allow banks to be put into insolvency. The Bank has devised a system to instead \u201cresolve\u201d banks instead of putting them into insolvency and has such a plan \u2013 sometimes known as \u201cliving wills\u201d \u2013 for each lender. The details of how big lenders would cope with a crisis will be published from 2019 and are intended to demonstrate to the public that they will no longer be on the hook when banks collapse. \u201cJust like when other business fails, losses arising from bank failure would be imposed on shareholders and investors. This protects the public from loss and incentivises banks to operate more prudently,\u201d said Cunliffe. As part of the plans, the industry needs \u00a3116bn of special funding \u2013 bonds that can be turned into equity during times of crisis. Some \u00a3112bn can be found by rejigging their existing borrowings, while an extra \u00a34bn will need to be issued by institutions. Banks have been issuing these types of bonds in recent years; HSBC, for example, has issued \u00a380bnin the past 18 months. These bonds are known as MREL \u2013 minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities \u2013 and are regarded as a crucial part of the toolkit that the Bank will be able to deploy if there is a re-run of the 2008 crisis. The Bank has set out how banks can be \u201cresolved\u201d \u2013 rather than liquidated like a company \u2013 in what it is describing as its \u201cpurple book\u201d for troubled institutions. \u201cResolution policy has come a long way since 2007,\u201d said Cunliffe, who added that banks needed to devise resolution plans now, before they run into trouble. \u201cResolution cannot be an afterthought. In order to have the option of resolution, when and if a bank fails, we need to ensure in advance that there are resources that can be bailed in and that other barriers to effective resolution have been removed.\u201d The threat of resolution was hung over bondholders in the Co-operative Bank.

      "bodyText": "Monarch Airlines passengers booked on early morning flights arrived at Luton, Gatwick and other airports to find the company had gone into administration, forcing them to make alternative travel plans. The Civil Aviation Authority said 300,000 Monarch bookings had been cancelled and it has hired 34 charter planes to get 110,000 people back to the UK, after the airline\u2019s administrators, KPMG, stopped all flights from 4am on Monday. At Gatwick on Monday, a bride and groom found their flight to their wedding destination had been cancelled five minutes before they were due to board. Alan Jee, 42, from Bournemouth, said their week had been plunged into chaos after flights for 30 of his friends and family were also affected. He said calls to find replacement transport proved fruitless and he was facing the prospect of sleeping at Gatwick until it was sorted \u2013 or even missing Saturday\u2019s \u00a320,000 wedding in Gran Canaria altogether. \u201cWe went past passport control, then five minutes before we were due to go on the plane they just put an announcement out saying everything\u2019s been cancelled and if we want to get flights anywhere else we have to pay for them ourselves,\u201d Jee told PA. \u201cMy missus just burst straight into tears, and my mother-in-law and my mum.\u201d He added: \u201c[Monarch] are doing absolutely nothing about it whatsoever, they\u2019ve palmed us off. No one\u2019s told us anything about it, we\u2019ve tried speaking to Monarch but they\u2019ve gone into liquidation. They can\u2019t get any more flights and we can\u2019t get a hotel out here until this is sorted.\u201d At Luton a small sign saying \u201cInformation for passengers\u201d had been placed at the entrance to the airport\u2019s departure area. \u201cAll Monarch airlines flights from 2 October 2017 are cancelled as the airline has ceased trading,\u201d it said. Inside the dim, under-refurbishment departures area, Hazel Henson and Ann Johnson sat by Starbucks, waiting for flights rebooked with other operators. \u201cWe arrived this morning just before four o\u2019clock,\u201d said Henson, 47, who had left home at 2am to catch a Monarch flight with her husband. She said that when they arrived there was no warning that their trip would not go ahead and the Monarch information desk was closed. \u201cWe checked in yesterday and when we got here this morning, just after four o\u2019clock, my husband got an email saying thank you for checking in.\u201d Henson said her husband had paid about \u00a3270 for replacement flights with easyJet after airport staff initially told them to go home. They are due to fly at 5pm, 11 hours after arriving at the airport. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to ruin our holiday, and that\u2019s why my husband has paid for more flights.\u201d Johnson, 75, from Luton, and her husband spent \u00a3450 buying new tickets to Faro with Ryanair. \u201cI\u2019m angry with Luton airport because there was no information from them. They just left us. No tannoy; nothing,\u201d she said. Cabin crew attended a meeting about the collapse of their former employer on Monday morning at the airline\u2019s training centre, close to the Monarch head office near Luton airport. After the meeting Natasha Slessor, five months\u2019 pregnant and wondering how she will support her baby, said she and colleagues heard the news in an email sent at about 3.30am. \u201cI woke up devastated, reading the emails, came to work this morning and we all met in the crew room and just waited to find out what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said. The collapse had been unexpected for most Monarch workers, Slessor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been kept in the dark for a long time. We had emails about speculation: one moment we were going long haul, we were flying to New York, we were going to be OK. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell us anything, they kept us in the dark. We\u2019ve been working all this time and put in overtime, and now we haven\u2019t got a job.\u201d Another crew member, who preferred not to give her name, said workers were devastated: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the end of an era. It\u2019s like losing family, everybody knows everybody at Luton. It\u2019s a nightmare. What are we going to do now?\u201d Jayne Deacon, 29, from Manchester, booked flights to Barcelona with Monarch for the end of October as a birthday treat for her partner after her original booking with Ryanair was cancelled due to pilot rostering issues. Deacon, who works for a travel company, only booked her flights with Monarch five days ago: \u201cWe\u2019ve ended up cancelling the birthday trip as the cost to fly with other airlines is too much. \u201cMy partner also experienced the same bad luck when her Christmas flights back to Spain were cancelled with Ryanair and rebooked with Monarch. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially put me off low-cost airlines, and next time I book anything I\u2019ll put it on a credit card.\u201d Doug and Lynne Webster from Derbyshire flew out to Italy on Saturday only to read about Monarch\u2019s troubles the next day. Doug said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe we were allowed to get on the plane. The pilots and crew must have known about this before the flight took off.\u201d Doug Webster, who works as an IT engineer and is in Lake Garda on holiday, said: \u201cIt\u2019s ruined our week. We\u2019re both unwell and had we known we wouldn\u2019t have travelled. Our booking is Atol-protected, but we booked a private transfer to Verona airport for our return flight on Saturday and we don\u2019t know what will happen yet. \u201cWe have had no communication from or with Monarch. It\u2019s disgraceful. It\u2019s not about money but trust and honesty. Someone must have known there were some serious issues prior to our departure given that one day later they tanked.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair pilots have formed an unofficial trade union and are invoking the spirit of Winston Churchill in a battle with the chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, over their employment terms. O\u2019Leary has clashed with pilots amid the fallout from the Dublin-based carrier\u2019s recent pilot rostering \u201cmess-up\u201d, which saw more than 700,000 passengers affected by flight cancellations. A letter circulated among pilots and seen by the Guardian indicates they are coordinating to derail Ryanair\u2019s strategy of negotiating separately with multiple employee representative committees (ERCs), small groups representing individual airport bases. Instead, they have now formed a central committee to replace the ERCs, in a move designed to improve their bargaining power. According to a letter from the committee to pilots, it was set up to \u201coppose the longstanding strategy of divide and conquer that Ryanair has applied in its dealing with pilots\u201d. It warns that pilots are likely to face a tough battle given Ryanair\u2019s policy of not recognising trade unions and dealing instead with multiple ERCs separately. Ryanair allows its employees to be members of trade unions, but it generally refuses to recognise or negotiate with unions. \u201cTo overthrow this structure will require immense force of will, stamina and commitment from every pilot,\u201d the letter says. \u201cIt is entirely possible that things will get worse before they get any better. Expect management to fight any change by all means available to them. There will be casualties.\u201d In a final rallying cry, the committee urged pilots to make autumn 2017 \u201cthe beginning of the end of the race to the bottom for our profession\u201d. \u201cTo paraphrase Churchill: Let us make sure future colleagues look back and say: \u2018This was their finest hour.\u2019\u201d According to the letter, while Ryanair has offered improved pay terms to pilots at four bases \u2013 Stansted, Dublin, Frankfurt and Berlin \u2013 none has yet agreed to any deal. It said Stansted pilots were in the process of electing new representatives, while other UK airport bases have arranged meetings with the British pilots\u2019 trade union Balpa to take place on Monday and on Wednesday. Pilots in Dublin have agreed to approach the Irish pilots\u2019 union IALPA with a view to some form of cooperation, the letter claimed. It urged pilots at individual airport bases not to respond to any offers from the company and to report any such communication to the committee. Committee members will remain anonymous until they have secure legal guarantees that there will be no reprisal from Ryanair for their actions. Despite the letter\u2019s confrontational tone, the central committee warned pilots to think carefully before adopting tactics such as coordinating mass sick days or \u201cwork to rule\u201d, which would involve refusing to carry out non-contractual tasks such as turning up early to ensure punctuality. The committee warned this could expose individual pilots to lawsuits from the company, or trigger disciplinary procedures that could cow other pilots into silence. Rather than making detailed demands, the committee said it was seeking a structural overhaul of pilots\u2019 representation at Ryanair, including legal tools that would allow them to push for changes to employment terms. Ryanair had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. Separately, the airline cancelled a further 21 flights from Pisa due to a strike by ground handling staff at the Italian airport. It also repeated its apology to more than 700,000 customers affected by two waves of flight cancellations due to the pilot rostering error. Ryanair said alternative routings or refunds had been processed for 98% of passengers affected by the first wave, while 75% of those affected by the second wave had been assisted.",

      "bodyText": "At the annual meeting of Starbucks shareholders in March, executives were confronted by a barista who demanded more paid family leave for new moms like her. Now, if a group of Starbucks investors has its way, the people asking that question will soon be the shareholders themselves. On Monday, a group led by Zevin Asset Management announced it would pressure Starbucks to inform shareholders of whether its paid family leave policy \u2013 which offers less leave to retail workers than to corporate employees \u2013 might count as employment discrimination. \u201cPaid family leave is a huge factor in how well women can stay involved in the workforce after having a baby, or how much time out they have to take in their careers,\u201d said Pat Tomaino, Zevin\u2019s associate director of socially responsible investing. \u201cWomen and their families benefit from equal and generous paid family leave \u2013 but companies do too.\u201d It appears to be the first shareholder proposal calling for a company to rethink its policy on paid family leave. Nor are the investors stopping with Starbucks. In letters sent this summer, Zevin warned nearly a dozen other major employers \u2013 among them Costco, Target, UPS, Amazon, AT&amp;T, Apple, CVS, and Marriott \u2013 that their paid leave policies could face similar scrutiny. Starbucks is the first target because its family leave policies are already being protested by a vocal group of baristas and store managers. The coffee company offers employees of its corporate offices 16 weeks\u2019 paid leave if they give birth and 12 weeks if they are new fathers or adoptive parents. Retail workers who give birth or adopt are eligible for six weeks of paid leave; dads whose partners give birth get none. Starbucks argues its parental leave policy is one of the best in the retail industry. But parents protesting the policy say it presents a hardship. \u201cIt is in no way fair to the average worker,\u201d Jess Svabenik, a new mother and a barista, told the Guardian. \u201cYou can\u2019t have corporate without us, so why would one have a better benefit than the other?\u201d The proposal that investors filed with the company suggested that the policy could be discriminatory. LGBTQ parents, Tomaino said, are especially disadvantaged. Tomaino added that the unequal policy poses a \u201creputational liability\u201d, because Starbucks executives have repeatedly boasted about treating corporate and retail employees equally. At the March 2017 shareholders meeting, Howard Schultz, the outgoing chief executive, said a decision in the 1990s to offer stock options and healthcare \u201cto everyone that worked at Starbucks, including part time people \u2026 became the foundation of the culture of the company.\u201d Tomaino said Starbucks has said it is willing to discuss the proposal before it comes to a vote. A company spokeswoman would not comment on how Starbucks would respond to the proposal, but touted its benefits policy. \u201cWe offer a more robust benefits package than any other retail company,\u201d said Jaime Riley. \u201cYou will not find another company that has pioneered more innovative benefits for full- and part-time employees.\u201d Shareholder resolutions are becoming more popular as a way to press for gender equality. They typically originate with smaller investors and rarely pass, because they do not receive the necessary support from major shareholders. The proposals do not have to pass, however, to make an impact. In 2016, the investment firm Arjuna Capital used similar measures to pressure Amazon, Apple, Expedia, Intel, and Microsoft to disclose whether they paid men and women equitably. Before the proposals could come to a vote, all five companies said they had closed their gender pay gaps or would take the necessary steps. Arjuna Capital is one of several cosigners to the proposal now before Starbucks. \u201cStarbucks will have to defend its policy of treating people in retail outlets differently than people at its headquarters, even if this has very little chance of passing,\u201d said Peter Henning, a professor at Wayne State University law school. This article was amended on 3 October 2017, to reflect Starbucks leave policy changes which came into effect on 1 October.",

      "bodyText": "Some of Britain\u2019s wealthiest homeowners have seen as much as \u00a313m wiped off the value of their property in a year as Brexit uncertainty and tax changes continue to wreak havoc in the prime central London market. According to new research, Kensington Palace Gardens in west London tops the list of the most expensive streets in Britain, with an average property value of \u00a335.7m \u2013 although that is \u00a32.5m less than this time last year, when the figure was \u00a338.3m. In July 2015 a typical property in the street was worth \u00a342.6m \u2013 which reflects a near-\u00a37m decline in just over two years, said property website Zoopla in its annual Rich List of house prices. Kensington Palace Gardens is reported to be home to Chelsea football club\u2019s owner, Roman Abramovich, the Formula One heiress Tamara Ecclestone and the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah. However, the ultra-wealthy owners of homes in the Boltons, two miles south, have had a much tougher time of it. Zoopla said the average value of a property on the street in South Kensington had plummeted from \u00a333.3m this time last year to just under \u00a320m now. Previous residents of the Boltons include Madonna and actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr. The Boltons came third in the table of the top 10 most expensive streets, all of which are in London. Other roads in the area, such as Manresa Road in Chelsea, had smaller falls, and a few increased in value over the year. Other surveys have also reported sharp falls in some of the capital\u2019s most expensive boroughs. Last month the property site Rightmove said the average asking price of a newly marketed home in Kensington and Chelsea fell by \u00a3308,000 between August and September. On Tuesday, upmarket estate agent Savills said prices in central London had fallen by 3.2% in the first nine months of this year, and were 15.2% below their peak three years ago. On Friday, Nationwide said London house prices had fallen for the first time year on year since the height of the financial crisis eight years ago. Rightmove described the slump in the high-end central London market as a \u201creadjustment\u201d, and quoted an estate agent saying that, since the introduction of the 3% surcharge on stamp duty paid by investors, along with the uncertainty over how Brexit would pan out, \u201cinvestors have been standing on the sidelines\u201d. Zoopla said there were now 14,417 streets in Britain where the average property value is \u00a31m or more \u2013 up from 12,418 in 2016. Of those, 5,899 are in Greater London. The Yorkshire and the Humber region has 77 \u00a31m streets, north-east England has 45 and Wales has 11. In line with this trend, 19 of the 20 towns with the highest number of \u00a31m-plus streets are in southern England. Guildford in Surrey takes the top spot with 204, with Reading in Berkshire in second place with 187. Zoopla says its website attracts more than 40m visits per month. Asked about the large fall recorded for the Boltons, a spokesman said: \u201cThe number of estimates on a given road can vary and can be subject to change throughout the year. In the case of the Boltons, it could be that several estimates have been newly added to listings which previously didn\u2019t have a figure attached, and this may have had the knock-on impact on the street\u2019s average value compared to last year.\u201d",
