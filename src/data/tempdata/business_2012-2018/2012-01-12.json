      "body": "<p>Catalogue chain Argos has blamed the squeeze on living standards faced by low-income families for dire Christmas sales.</p> <p>The weeks leading up to Christmas are usually the best of the year for the struggling catalogue chain but its boss Terry Duddy said they had been a rollercoaster ride as shoppers cut back spending on gifts such as iPods and game consoles.</p> <p>\"Volatile is the word I would use,\" said Duddy. \"Day-to-day, week-to-week sales have been all over the place.\"</p> <p>Duddy argues that Argos customers, drawn from the mass market C2 and D socio-economic groups, are struggling because they have not benefited from falls in mortgage rates as much as those with higher incomes. Divergent sales performances he said were explained by \"following the money\" \u2013 \"the John Lewis and Sainsbury's customer base has the money\".</p> <p>Last year Argos was in the frontline of a collapse in spending on consumer electronics with sales of flat-screen TVs and video games down nearly 20%, with analysts arguing that it needs to close as many as 400 of its 759 outlets. That advice was ignored on Thursday with the retailer announcing plans to close only a handful of shops, even though Christmas sales were down nearly 9%.</p> <p>Maternity and childrenswear chain Mothercare also reported a drop in UK sales as it battled fierce competition from supermarkets and the internet, as well as parents scrimping on big-ticket purchases such as pushchairs.

      "bodyText": "Catalogue chain Argos has blamed the squeeze on living standards faced by low-income families for dire Christmas sales. The weeks leading up to Christmas are usually the best of the year for the struggling catalogue chain but its boss Terry Duddy said they had been a rollercoaster ride as shoppers cut back spending on gifts such as iPods and game consoles. \"Volatile is the word I would use,\" said Duddy. \"Day-to-day, week-to-week sales have been all over the place.\" Duddy argues that Argos customers, drawn from the mass market C2 and D socio-economic groups, are struggling because they have not benefited from falls in mortgage rates as much as those with higher incomes. Divergent sales performances he said were explained by \"following the money\" \u2013 \"the John Lewis and Sainsbury's customer base has the money\". Last year Argos was in the frontline of a collapse in spending on consumer electronics with sales of flat-screen TVs and video games down nearly 20%, with analysts arguing that it needs to close as many as 400 of its 759 outlets. That advice was ignored on Thursday with the retailer announcing plans to close only a handful of shops, even though Christmas sales were down nearly 9%. Maternity and childrenswear chain Mothercare also reported a drop in UK sales as it battled fierce competition from supermarkets and the internet, as well as parents scrimping on big-ticket purchases such as pushchairs. It has announced plans to close more than 100 of its UK stores over the next two years after a disastrous year that saw chief executive Ben Gordon shown the door after a series of profit warnings. Its executive chairman, Alan Parker, said the troubled business was showing signs of improvement but its customers were under pressure with sales of its \"baby plan\" \u2013 which spreads the cost of kitting out a nursery \u2013 up 26%.

    "webTitle": "Greece races to tie up writedown deal before debt repayments fall due", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece and its private-sector creditors are involved in a race against time to finalise a debt writedown deal over the next 48 hours that will prevent the troubled country from defaulting on its massive debts. The body negotiating on behalf of investors is adopting a tough stance amid concerns that a breakdown in the talks would result in Greece failing to secure the next tranche of its bailout cash from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Charles Dallara, who heads the Washington-based International Institute of Finance, which is acting on behalf of private investors, said \"some key areas remained unresolved\" after a two-hour meeting with Greece's finance minister Evangelos Venizelos. \"Discussion will continue in Athens [on Friday] but time for reaching an agreement is running short,\" Dallara said in a statement. \"It is essential in order to finalise the voluntary agreement that support be given by all official parties in the days ahead.\" Venizelos expressed confidence that the talks would be successful, with European leaders hopeful that a resolution of the Greek crisis will take pressure off other vulnerable eurozone countries. The euro rose on exchanges after a successful bond auction in Spain and upbeat comments from the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi. Interest rates on 10-year Spanish and Italian bonds fell sharply, although analysts warned that it was far too early to say the eurozone was out of danger. Banks, insurance companies, pension funds and hedge funds holding Greek debt are under pressure to accept a 50% writedown \u2013 or \"haircut\" \u2013 on their investments in a bond-swap scheme. This crucial reduction would slice around \u20ac100bn (\u00a382.6bn) from its \u20ac205bn government debt, which would save Athens around \u20ac5bn in debt servicing costs and cut its debt pile from 160% of GDP to 120% by 2020 \u2013 a ratio that officials \u2013 not least in Germany, the main provider of EU rescue funds \u2013 see as much more sustainable. Piling on the pressure, the Greek government warned that without the second financial aid package \u2013 announced by EU leaders in October but delayed by wrangling over the bond swap \u2013 the nation would inevitably default on the \u20ac14.5bn of maturing debt it will have to repay on 20 March, a nightmare scenario for the rest of the eurozone. \"Once the details of the deal are agreed there are several more weeks of paperwork and actually getting the private sector to implement it,\" said a senior Greek government official. \"The intention is to have the basic agreement, at least, wrapped up by the time the troika [inspectors from the EU, ECB and IMF] arrive next week.\" In recent weeks, however, speculation that private investors would be forced to make further concessions and accept an even bigger writedown in the value of bonds has fuelled uncertainty over the scheme. Acknowledging the difficulty officials were having in attracting the private sector's approval, Greece's deputy finance minister, Filippos Sachinidis, hinted on Thursday that the EU may have to increase rescue funds for Athens if creditors refused to sign up to the deal. That development would inevitably incur the wrath of taxpayers in other eurozone countries. So far the ECB \u2013 the biggest holder of Greek bonds \u2013 has remained steadfast in its refusal to participate in the deal. \"If the percentage of participation is not, for instance, 100%, then Greece may need further support from the side of our partners to cover the financial gap,\" Sachinidis told a local radio station. His comments chimed with those of Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, who this week warned that, after months of missing fiscal targets, Greece's economic outlook looked little better than when the crisis erupted two years ago in the wake of revelations that the country's deficit was three times bigger than originally thought. The IMF chief also raised the prospect of the EU adding yet more money to the \u20ac130bn bailout it agreed in October, saying that if such a deal proved impossible, holders of private debt would have to accept even bigger losses. The seeming inability of Greece to improve its economic indicators despite an unprecedented austerity programme fuels persistent speculation over whether it will remain in the single currency. But polls have shown that despite unemployment hitting a record 18.5% and a barrage of wage cuts and tax increases demanded by international creditors in return for aid, the vast majority of Greeks are against reverting to their old currency, the drachma.",

Interest rates on 10-year Spanish and Italian bonds fell sharply, although analysts warned that it was far too early to say the eurozone was out of danger.</p> <p>Banks, insurance companies, pension funds and hedge funds holding Greek debt are under pressure to accept a 50% writedown \u2013 or \"haircut\" \u2013 on their investments in a bond-swap scheme. This crucial reduction would slice around \u20ac100bn (\u00a382.6bn) from its \u20ac205bn government debt, which would save Athens around \u20ac5bn in debt servicing costs and cut its debt pile from 160% of GDP to 120% by 2020 \u2013 a ratio that officials \u2013 not least in Germany, the main provider of EU rescue funds \u2013 see as much more sustainable.</p> <p>Piling on the pressure, the Greek government warned that without the second financial aid package \u2013 announced by EU leaders in October but delayed by wrangling over the bond swap \u2013 the nation would inevitably default on the \u20ac14.5bn of maturing debt it will have to repay on 20 March, a nightmare scenario for the rest of the eurozone.</p> <p>\"Once the details of the deal are agreed there are several more weeks of paperwork and actually getting the private sector to implement it,\" said a senior Greek government official. \"The intention is to have the basic agreement, at least, wrapped up by the time the troika [inspectors from the EU, ECB and IMF] arrive next week.\"</p> <p>In recent weeks, however, speculation that private investors would be forced to make further concessions and accept an even bigger writedown in the value of bonds has fuelled uncertainty over the scheme.</p> <p>Acknowledging the difficulty officials were having in attracting the private sector's approval, Greece's deputy finance minister, Filippos Sachinidis, hinted on Thursday that the EU may have to increase rescue funds for Athens if creditors refused to sign up to the deal.

      "bodyText": "It is not hard to imagine what a former Sony boss used to the trappings of a five-star corporate lifestyle would think of Solarcentury's offices. The renewable energy company's HQ is sandwiched between a betting shop and a newsagent offering money transfers in the colourful but scruffy market that shares the road behind Waterloo station in London. Derry Newman made that journey. The softly spoken but steely Welshman went from head of European operations at the Japanese electronic group with more than 3,500 staff to a job at Solarcentury, where he had responsibility for 65 employees. \"It was a shocking change,\" says the chief executive who gave up half his salary and company car to join a company that he has turned into one of Britain's fastest growing businesses, with a team that has almost doubled to 120 staff in his time there. But Newman is now about to embark on another brave leap of faith: into unemployment. The official reason the 54-year-old is quitting is that he wants to spend more time with his family. That is often a euphemism for a boardroom bust-up but in this case reflects the fact that both he and his wife have had health problems: \"There have been times when my wife has had illness and I have had to rush back from business trips abroad, and we don't want to be in that position again.\" His decision to leave Solarcentury in April, announced to the staff on Thursday, is not just about taking his marital duties seriously, it is also about looking after his children, himself \u2013 and the company. \"One of the first things I will do is go out and buy a dog for my son. I have committed to do that for him \u2013 but only when I had time to look after it properly. I have had 33 years at senior-level appointments when I have not been able to support the family in the way that I should or could have done. I do not want to get to the age of 60 and look back with regret.\" But Newman is also influenced by the fact that Solarcentury is at a turning point. The company, which is more often associated with its founder and chairman Jeremy Leggett, will hear in the appeal court on Friday whether the government had the legal right to cut the feed-in tariff (FIT), which reimburses small renewable energy generators, in the middle of a consultation period. Solarcentury and a group of other renewables firms won an earlier judgment against the Department of Energy and Climate Change and they expect to win again. But the reality is that any judgment over this decision will not stop the industry here being badly hit. The FIT is to be cut in half and new rules on insulation standards will rule out 90% of UK properties from receiving solar panels in future, argues Newman, who describes the move as \"draconian\". Solarcentury needs to find new markets in Asia and elsewhere fast, and the current says he is not the man for that job. \"I do not want to find myself in a position where I am financially secure but emotionally bankrupt and physically not able to do what is needed for the business. The demands on a chief executive these days are extreme. There is a need to give financial returns to investors, there are kneejerk reactions from governments and the need to keep the staff together. Anyone who leads a company and thinks they can take all this in their stride is fooling themselves. It inherently chips away at you and causes emotional and spiritual stress.\" Newman, born in Port Talbot and educated in engineering at Southampton, questions whether Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the group chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group who recently took time off work due to fatigue, was right to rush back, and Newman says he does not want to end up like Steve Jobs, the Apple boss who kept on working despite having pancreatic cancer and being already one of the richest men in the world. There are serious challenges at Solarcentury but Newman says he is leaving the company with no debt and a strong pipeline of contracts including high-profile ones such as the setting-up of new lighting for Blackfriars station in London, involving the installation of more than 4,400 solar photovoltaic panels on a bridge over the Thames \u2013 which the company says will be the biggest solar array in London. And, although he must be looking forward to cutting out the commute from his home in Fleet, Hampshire, he reflects: \"Whoever comes in will have a rare privilege. There are few companies where the staff all have absolute passion for their work.\"",

During a sometimes highly personalised three-hour Commons debate, MPs also called for an industry-wide statutory code of practice with an option for publicans to be free of being tied to pubcos alongside an open market review of rent, all overseen by an independent body. The independent inquiry, due to report in the autumn, marks a shift from the government's alternative plan to encourage legally binding self-regulation in the sector, a settlement agreed in December between government and the large pub trade bodies. During the debate, the government's decision in December to welcome the deal announced by the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), the trade association that includes pubcos in its membership, was slammed by MPs on all sides of the house. Adrian Bailey, the chairman of the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, said: \"The pledge given by the minister fails to meet the aspirations of virtually all sections of the industry, apart from the pub companies themselves. \"Up and down the country there are literally thousands of publicans who will be listening and watching this today.

Davey rejected claims of collusion with the BBPA, and said that he met with a wide range of parties during the consultation. The Conservative MP Brian Binley accused pubcos of operating a \"model that is unsustainable, and continues on the base of excessive debt, misleading information and deception\". He also alleged that some tenants \"face prices higher than on the open market, they face exorbitant rents and a measure of misleading information\".

The \"interconnectedness\" of economies around the world became startlingly clear in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, as the shock was transmitted and amplified through financial markets. New research by Goldman Sachs suggests that as the eurozone slowdown bites in the coming months, families and businesses from Istanbul to Lima will be reminded that, like it or not, we're all in this together. Emerging economies \u2013 including the ex-communist countries in the waiting room to join the euro \u2013 were hit hard by the Great Recession in 2008-09, but many managed to recover with the help of drastic cuts in interest rates by the ECB, the Bank of England and the Fed, which sent cheap credit flowing to firms and businesses far beyond the borders of Europe or the US. While credit flows in the world's largest economies have all but ground to a halt since the crunch, in emerging markets they're back to pre-crisis levels. According to Goldman's analysis, that could be about to come to an end. Depressed demand for exports from eurozone customers is the most obvious channel through which the turmoil in the euro area will hit other economies. But Goldman's analysts identify two other ways in which the crisis that has spiralled out from Greece and Portugal to plunge the German economy into the red in the final quarter of 2011 will hit scores of other countries. First, \"deleveraging\" \u2013 the process of struggling banks withdrawing assets to get their balance sheets back in shape \u2013 will squeeze the flow of credit and make it harder for businesses in many emerging countries to raise capital from foreign investors. At the same time, Goldman argues that a collapse in confidence could lead to a sharp decline in bank lending even in countries that aren't heavily dependent on lending from eurozone financial institutions. By testing how closely linked recent economic growth has been to credit expansion \u2013 and therefore how vulnerable each country is likely to be to a so-called \"sudden stop\" in capital flows \u2013 Goldman identifies a disturbingly long list of economies that could be in the firing line. Turkey, Colombia, Hong Kong, Peru, Indonesia, Russia and Poland have all attracted a healthy flow of investment since 2008, as City analysts have thumbed the pages of their atlases looking for alternatives to the clapped-out economies in the developed world. But that means they may now be heavily exposed to the sharp change in mood in Brussels and beyond.

      "bodyText": "Will it or won't it? The weakness of Britain's industrial sector late last year has re-invigorated the debate about whether the economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2011 and is on course for a double-dip recession. Official data will be published this month, and as things stand the consensus is that it is too close to call. Here's how things stack up. The growth figure that will be released by the Office for National Statistics is based on the output from three sectors of the economy: services (more than 76% of the total); industry (just over 15%); and construction (a little more than 7.5%). So far there is only data for the services and construction sectors in October, while that from industry is a bit more up to date, covering both October and November. Construction output dipped in October, while activity in the services sector was estimated by the ONS to be down 0.7%. Industrial production figures showed a 0.6% decline in November, following a 1% drop in October, and if there was no change in December there would be a 1.4% fall between the third and fourth quarters of 2011, enough to shave 0.2% off national output. On the face of it, the signs are ominous, but it is not all bad news. Service sector output tends to bounce around, and the survey evidence from the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply was relatively upbeat for November and December. But, as George Buckley at Deutsche Bank notes, even a chunky 0.8% increase in output in November followed by a further 0.5% jump in December would still only result in a 0.2% increase in the fourth quarter. The warm weather should help construction output by keeping building sites open. As with services, the survey evidence has been stronger than expected. Predicting the path of national output at the turn of the year is always tough because of the capriciousness of the elements and the concentration of consumer spending in December and January. The likelihood is that the economy moved sideways in the fourth quarter of 2011, and it would be something of a surprise if it grew by more than 0.2% or contracted by more than 0.2%. Whatever the outcome, there has clearly been a slowdown in the final few months of the year prompted by a lack of consumer spending power and the crisis in the eurozone. Not much should be read into the decision by the Bank of England to do nothing at today's meeting. If Threadneedle Street is going to decide on more quantitative easing, February has always been the month to announce it. That still remains a real possibility.",

Standing in heels and smiling all day can't be easy, especially when you are being snapped by the world's auto press. Just like the cars, the models at the auto show change from year to year, but year after year after year they manage to keep smiling.</p> <p>Just occasionally, the models let their faces slip, as if they've woken from a dream to realise this really is 2012, not 1972. I'm not naming names here \u2013 a girl's gotta work \u2013 but I saw one who briefly looked like some vengeful queen from a vampire movie, angry-eyed and ready to kill. Then, as if she'd been spotted my gaze, she snapped back into action, all hair and smiles. Detroit was saved from the attack of the killer car girl.</p> <p>Using women to sell stuff is hardly new. And to be fair to the auto show, it's done in reasonably good taste. The shows in Europe and Asia (except China) are, by all accounts, far more Austin Powers meets Russ Meyer. No one gets draped across the hood in a bikini in Detroit; the \"look\" this year was more cocktail dress or catsuits than thongs and Jello. At Lincoln's flashy stand, designed by U2 set designer Chuck Hoberman, huge pulsating globes hovered above professionally chic women, who looked like they were plotting to take over the world, if James Bond didn't stop them.</p> <p>And where was James Bond? There was a brief flash of man candy when a Jon Hamm-look-a-like appeared behind the wheel of Toyota's NS4 concept car. But he was <em>driving</em>.</p> <p>Otherwise, though, cut the LCD screens, knock out the hybrids, add a few tail fins and shorten the skirts and this could have been any car show since the second world war.</p> <p>What other major industry so blatantly ignores the fact that half its customers are women, and another (far smaller, but not insignificant) fraction are gay men? Sure, sex sells, but there are two of them, you know. About 34% of all the cars registered in the US are registered to women, but there are precious few women in senior positions at the car firms in the US and even fewer in Europe and Asia.</p> <p>Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at <a href=\"http://www.edmunds.com/\">Edmunds.com</a>, has been covering the auto industry for 30-years. \"It's had it's moments,\" she says, diplomatically. Things are getting better, she says, but only recently, she turned up at a senior industry event where she was the only woman of the 75 people in the room.</p> <p>This year, there was a lot of talk about \"the millenials\". The car industry is desperate to sell to the next generation of car buyers.</p> <p>It's easy to see why. There were about 80m of them born between 1980 and 1995 and they represent the biggest selling opportunity for the car firms since the baby boomers. Sadly, they just aren't buying. From the chatter at Detroit, you would think this was because they are locked in a digital world of Facebook and everything Apple. The car industry isn't doing enough to attract them with cars that make the grade in the era of the iPad, runs the patter.</p> <p>The truth is probably more to do with economics than ergonomics: cash-strapped, people have been putting off big purchases \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=144668532\">average age of a car in the US has reached a record 11 years</a>. If and when the economy does improve, those millenials will no doubt buy cars and move out of their parents' homes, probably in that order.</p> <p>But what the industry seems to have missed is the ones with the most money to spend will probably be women. More women than ever are taking MBAs: last year, a study by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) found that <a href=\"http://www.topmba.com/articles/admissions/women-post-highest-ever-levels-mba-applications\">48% of MBA-programme hopefuls were women</a>, up from 35% in 2006. Women earned the majority of degrees in 2008/09 across all levels, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.</p> <p>Perhaps, the automakers should add a bit more man candy to next year's show \u2013 some skinny indie boys and a few tattooed rockers, or whatever millenials are into. They need to do something different: no millennial is going to be sold by this 70s game show aesthetic. It's time to end the march of the dolls.</p>",

And where was James Bond? There was a brief flash of man candy when a Jon Hamm-look-a-like appeared behind the wheel of Toyota's NS4 concept car. But he was driving. Otherwise, though, cut the LCD screens, knock out the hybrids, add a few tail fins and shorten the skirts and this could have been any car show since the second world war. What other major industry so blatantly ignores the fact that half its customers are women, and another (far smaller, but not insignificant) fraction are gay men? Sure, sex sells, but there are two of them, you know. About 34% of all the cars registered in the US are registered to women, but there are precious few women in senior positions at the car firms in the US and even fewer in Europe and Asia. Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at Edmunds.com, has been covering the auto industry for 30-years. \"It's had it's moments,\" she says, diplomatically. Things are getting better, she says, but only recently, she turned up at a senior industry event where she was the only woman of the 75 people in the room. This year, there was a lot of talk about \"the millenials\". The car industry is desperate to sell to the next generation of car buyers. It's easy to see why. There were about 80m of them born between 1980 and 1995 and they represent the biggest selling opportunity for the car firms since the baby boomers. Sadly, they just aren't buying. From the chatter at Detroit, you would think this was because they are locked in a digital world of Facebook and everything Apple. The car industry isn't doing enough to attract them with cars that make the grade in the era of the iPad, runs the patter. The truth is probably more to do with economics than ergonomics: cash-strapped, people have been putting off big purchases \u2013 the average age of a car in the US has reached a record 11 years. If and when the economy does improve, those millenials will no doubt buy cars and move out of their parents' homes, probably in that order. But what the industry seems to have missed is the ones with the most money to spend will probably be women. More women than ever are taking MBAs: last year, a study by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) found that 48% of MBA-programme hopefuls were women, up from 35% in 2006. Women earned the majority of degrees in 2008/09 across all levels, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Perhaps, the automakers should add a bit more man candy to next year's show \u2013 some skinny indie boys and a few tattooed rockers, or whatever millenials are into. They need to do something different: no millennial is going to be sold by this 70s game show aesthetic. It's time to end the march of the dolls.",

      "bodyText": "For all his efforts since taking on the task of turning round Royal Bank of Scotland, Stephen Hester still appears to be running a bank the size of the UK economy. Hester, who inherited a bank reporting the biggest loss in British corporate history of \u00a324bn and a balance sheet of \u00a32.2 trillion, has already shed \u00a3600bn of assets and cut 33,000 jobs, some 22,000 of which are in the UK. Another \u00a3100bn of assets have gone from the non-core business. Even with the announcement on Thursday of another overhaul of the investment bank, which will involve \u00a3120bn of asset reductions in the next three years, RBS will still have a balance sheet of about \u00a31.4tn. According to the data supplied by the Treasury for the 2011 budget, that is equivalent to the value of the output from the UK economy. RBS will provide a more up-to-date picture of its size when it reports its full-year results next month. Further shrinkage is likely. The marker to watch is by how far the \u00a31.4tn barrier can be broken \u2013 and any indication of what impact the ringfencing proposals from the Independent Commission on Banking will have on shrinking the bank even further.",

But, there will be serious challenges in the months ahead, particularly for those that rely heavily on exports to the eurozone.\" The Treasury is keenly anticipating the first estimate of GDP growth later this month, which will reveal whether the economy contracted in the final three months of 2011. Two negative quarters would mark a double-dip recession. Industrial production figures for the eurozone were also released, showing a better-than-expected decline of 0.1% in November, compared with forecasts for a 0.3% drop.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has given up on global ambitions for its investment bank, announcing 3,500 City-style roles are for the axe as it focuses on profitable operations and adapts to regulatory changes. The latest job cuts in the investment bank \u2013 on top of 2,000 in the second half of 2011 \u2013 were announced alongside 950 redundancies at Ulster Bank and take the job cull since Stephen Hester was parachuted in to run the bank after its October 2008 bailout to 34,000. Unite, the union at the retail banking arm, believes 22,000 roles have gone in the UK. Separately, Barclays announced 422 IT jobs would go from its retail bank with some roles going offshore to Lithuania. Under Hester, 10,000 jobs will have been axed from the RBS investment bank \u2013 the global banking and markets (GBM) arm that expanded rapidly after the ill-timed ABN Amro takeover \u2013 although the scaled-down operation will still employ 13,400 by the end of the latest three-year restructuring. The fresh job cuts, and the pledge to cut another \u00a3120bn from the bank's bulging balance sheet, propelled the shares 6% higher to 23p \u2013 which still represents a \u00a324bn loss on the taxpayer's 83% stake. Hester has already cut \u00a3700bn from the \u00a32.2 trillion balance sheet he inherited. The rise in the shares inflated a potential \u00a34m-plus share-based bonus for John Hourican, who will run the streamlined investment bank, by around \u00a3250,000. Unite branded any potential bonuses \"a disgrace\". The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said: \"This is not the time to start paying people lavish bonuses.\" Hester told staff he was sorry that details of the cuts had been leaked. He added: \"This is a part of business I hate; making decisions that adversely affect people. But I truly believe that the best result for the most people can only lie in us making RBS a business success, sustainable for the long term.\" Without the changes, profits in the wholesale business would be at unacceptable levels, he added. But he stressed he had no regrets about his decision up until now to use GBM to generate \u00a310bn of profits since 2009. This had been \"essential to pay for the clean-up losses of [the] RBS legacy\". When Hester took the helm following the bailout \u2013 which eventually amounted to \u00a345bn \u2013 the bank reported the biggest loss in British corporate history of \u00a324bn . Despite the cuts, the bailed-out bank will continue to employ some big earners. While GBM is to be renamed markets and international banking, it will still be involved in some potentially lucrative businesses. The \"markets\" part will focus on trading debt, currencies and money markets, while GBM's corporate banking business will be merged with global transaction services to create the \"international\" arm. The unprofitable cash equities, corporate broking, equity capital markets, and mergers and acquisitions businesses \u2013 part of which is Hoare Govett \u2013 will be sold or shut down. In December George Osborne told parliament that RBS was embarking on \"further significant reductions\" in its investment banking arm when he pledged to implement the recommendations by the Independent Commission on Banking. Hester had already signalled further cuts were on the cards in the investment bank as he responded the downturn in activity caused by the eurozone crisis. The bank was careful to indicate on Thursday that it was in the process of realigning its business to erect the \"ringfence\" around its high-street business that was recommended by the ICB, but provided no more detail.",
