Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday, Paul drew a strong link between political donations and the decision of successive governments to retain the tax break, saying the system was open to \u201ccorruption\u201d.</p> <p>As early as 1988, the Inland Revenue consulted on how non-dom tax perks might be swept away. The initiative was abandoned, but in 1996, Gordon Brown indicated Labour would end the special treatment. </p> <p>His spin doctor told the Sunday People: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong that some millionaires pay no tax and we\u2019ll make sure they all pay their fair share in the future.\u201d</p> <p>But the numbers declaring themselves non-domicile UK residents did not dwindle under Tony Blair\u2019s prime ministership \u2013 they increased. There were 67,600 non-doms when Labour came to power in 1997, and 137,000 a decade later.</p> <p>At the same time, non-dom entrepreneurs like Lakshmi Mittal and Richard Caring were donating millions to Labour. Mittal wrote two separate \u00a32m cheques to the party in 2005 and 2007, giving over \u00a35m in total before 2010.</p> <p>Efforts to reform the system were stymied. In 2008, with Alistair Darling as chancellor, Labour passed legislation which simply introduced a new set of loopholes.</p> <p>Non-doms could stay in the UK for up to seven years with all the benefits \u2013 tax-free offshore income and capital gains, no inheritance tax, and, for many, no obligation to pay tax on offshore assets in their country of origin either.</p> <p>Those who stayed longer than seven years would either pay tax on worldwide income like any ordinary UK citizen, or pay an annual fee and retain all their offshore protection. Today that fee stands at \u00a330,000-\u00a390,000, depending on how long the individual has resided in the UK.</p> <p>That is a high a price to pay for ordinary earners, but small change to a billionaire with hundreds of millions to lose in tax. \u201cFor those people, the annual fee is a weekend\u2019s pocket money on a trip to Monaco,\u201d says Christensen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Non-dom status became so commonplace that British citizens, like HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver, started swapping homelands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And for non-doms resident in the UK for the less than 17 years, there is still no inheritance tax. The only real requirements to qualify are a foreign passport, and successfully persuading the tax man that one intends to end one\u2019s days abroad.</p> <p>Giving his verdict on the changes, tax adviser Patrick Harney, a partner at London firm Forsters, wrote: \u201cSince 2008, there have been significant changes in the UK tax treatment of UK resident non-domiciliaries that have made tax planning for \u2018non-doms\u2019 a much more complex task. Nonetheless, the basic premise about the UK being a tax haven for the well-advised \u2019non-dom\u2019 remains true.\u201d</p> <p>The status has other attractions. Fiona Fernie, tax partner at Pinsent Masons, explains: \u201cFor the people in the media, they tend to pay the charge because it\u2019s important to keep a certain level of privacy around their affairs.\u201d</p> <p>Debate is now focusing on how much, if anything, reform could raise.

      "bodyText": "When John Major was contemplating scrapping the tax advantages of non-dom status some decades ago, legend has it he changed his mind after a delegation of Greek shipping merchants descended on Downing Street, threatening to move the Baltic Exchange shipping market from London to Hamburg. Successive generations of ministers across the political spectrum have tried and failed to close the loophole that allows wealthy individuals with foreign passports to live in the UK, raise their families here and often end their days here, without paying tax on their offshore fortunes. But Ed Miliband\u2019s pledge to end an \u201cunfair\u201d system that discriminates against ordinary UK citizens is the first by a serving party leader. If the electorate returns a Labour government, there will be considerable pressure to water down any changes. The Tax Justice Network has lobbied for abolition of the loophole on the grounds that it is discriminatory. Its director, John Christensen, says: \u201cMy suspicion is there are no real benefits to the UK economy [from the nom-dom rule]. The politicians do it because of the power of the lobbies that fund the political parties. \u201cThere is a large and influential industry of lawyers and accounting firms and estate agents who are extremely vociferous in lobbying for retention of this exemption, and throughout my career this lobby has been one of the most powerful but discrete going\u201d. One of the most startling revelations from the HSBC files \u2013 which highlighted tax avoidance and evasion aided by the bank\u2019s Swiss operation \u2013 was that while the bank\u2019s customers from Brazil, France or Italy were often hiding their money illegally in the bank\u2019s Swiss subsidiary, many UK resident non-doms were sheltering their assets in Switzerland with the full backing of British law. A typical tax exile will have UK residency, a Swiss account, and assets hidden in companies and trusts established in UK protectorates such as Jersey, Guernsey, the British Virgin Islands or the Cayman Islands, where details such as company accounts and even company ownership are not required to be published. Any UK assets, including homes, land, art collections and even garages full of high-end cars will typically be owned by such offshore trusts. This wealth is of little profit to the UK taxpayer, but can pay rich dividends for the UK lawyers, accountants and money managers who advise on how to hide it. Until 2010, non-doms were allowed to avoid tax while at the same time sitting as legislators in both houses of Parliament. Reforms saw the MP Zac Goldsmith and peer Swraj Paul renounce their non-dom status to hold on to their seats. Architect Norman Foster chose instead to renounce his seat in the Lords and keep his valuable non-dom status. But those who belong to the select club of the UK\u2019s wealthiest foreign citizens still hold sway over British politics. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday, Paul drew a strong link between political donations and the decision of successive governments to retain the tax break, saying the system was open to \u201ccorruption\u201d. As early as 1988, the Inland Revenue consulted on how non-dom tax perks might be swept away. The initiative was abandoned, but in 1996, Gordon Brown indicated Labour would end the special treatment. His spin doctor told the Sunday People: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong that some millionaires pay no tax and we\u2019ll make sure they all pay their fair share in the future.\u201d But the numbers declaring themselves non-domicile UK residents did not dwindle under Tony Blair\u2019s prime ministership \u2013 they increased. There were 67,600 non-doms when Labour came to power in 1997, and 137,000 a decade later. At the same time, non-dom entrepreneurs like Lakshmi Mittal and Richard Caring were donating millions to Labour. Mittal wrote two separate \u00a32m cheques to the party in 2005 and 2007, giving over \u00a35m in total before 2010. Efforts to reform the system were stymied. In 2008, with Alistair Darling as chancellor, Labour passed legislation which simply introduced a new set of loopholes. Non-doms could stay in the UK for up to seven years with all the benefits \u2013 tax-free offshore income and capital gains, no inheritance tax, and, for many, no obligation to pay tax on offshore assets in their country of origin either. Those who stayed longer than seven years would either pay tax on worldwide income like any ordinary UK citizen, or pay an annual fee and retain all their offshore protection. Today that fee stands at \u00a330,000-\u00a390,000, depending on how long the individual has resided in the UK. That is a high a price to pay for ordinary earners, but small change to a billionaire with hundreds of millions to lose in tax. \u201cFor those people, the annual fee is a weekend\u2019s pocket money on a trip to Monaco,\u201d says Christensen. And for non-doms resident in the UK for the less than 17 years, there is still no inheritance tax. The only real requirements to qualify are a foreign passport, and successfully persuading the tax man that one intends to end one\u2019s days abroad. Giving his verdict on the changes, tax adviser Patrick Harney, a partner at London firm Forsters, wrote: \u201cSince 2008, there have been significant changes in the UK tax treatment of UK resident non-domiciliaries that have made tax planning for \u2018non-doms\u2019 a much more complex task. Nonetheless, the basic premise about the UK being a tax haven for the well-advised \u2019non-dom\u2019 remains true.\u201d The status has other attractions. Fiona Fernie, tax partner at Pinsent Masons, explains: \u201cFor the people in the media, they tend to pay the charge because it\u2019s important to keep a certain level of privacy around their affairs.\u201d Debate is now focusing on how much, if anything, reform could raise. Of the 113,800 self-declared non-doms in 2012-13, only 5,080 paid the annual charge. Pinsent Masons estimate they paid \u00a36.8bn in tax that year, of which the levy was only 2.6%. Some argue that every incentive exists to prevent non-doms bringing money into the UK and incurring tax. Many have kept the majority of their business interests firmly abroad rather than creating hundreds of new jobs in the UK. What is certain is that, if the non-doms attracted to the UK in recent decades where to relocate again \u2013 to the Middle East, for example, where there is no income tax \u2013 the Top 20 of the annual Sunday Times rich list would require a major rewrite. A casual glance shows more than half the names \u2013 including the Hinduja brothers, the Russians Len Blavatnik and Roman Abramovich, and the Swiss Italian businessman Ernesto Bertarelli \u2013 may be eligible for the perk. HMRC does not publish names, but the roll call of declared non-doms includes the Tetra Pak heiress Sigrid Rausing, the financier Ben Goldsmith, the Dragons\u2019 Den entrepreneur James Caan, and the newspaper owner Viscount Rothermere, who inherited his French nationality, along with the Daily Mail newspaper, from his father. Non-dom tax exemption dates to 1799, when income tax began. UK residents were taxed only on money brought into the country. This encouraged outward investment \u2013 the profits from Jamaica sugarcane plantations or Virginia tobacco were sheltered from UK duties. But in 1914, with a war to pay for, the UK Finance act introduced income tax for overseas earnings as well. An exception was made for those resident, but not domiciled, in the UK.

Then came the Indian entrepreneurs and Russian oligarchs, along with tax refugees from some of Europe\u2019s most powerful families. Non-dom status became so commonplace in the City that some British citizens, like HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver, started swapping homelands. Gulliver lives in the UK, runs the country\u2019s biggest bank and educated his children in Britain, but he is now Hong Kong Chinese for tax purposes, and has told the UK tax office that he plans to end his days abroad. For tax campaigner Richard Murphy, reforming the non-dom laws would be the single biggest contribution to tax justice in the UK. \u201cThe significance of this cannot be overstated.

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that growth in the US economy had slowed and officials were divided on whether to raise interest rates for the first time since the global recession. Releasing the minutes of its March meeting, the Fed said officials had discussed the moderation of gross domestic product \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy \u2013 in the first quarter, even as the job market continued to improve. The minutes were drawn up before the latest official US jobs report recorded a sharp decrease in the rate of hiring. Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US economy added just 126,000 new jobs in March, barely half the number economists had expected and ending a 12-month streak of monthly gains of over 200,000 jobs. The latest job figures may have added weight to those Fed officials seeking a delay of in interest-rate hikes. \u201cSeveral participants judged that the economic data and outlook were likely to warrant beginning normalization at the June meeting,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cHowever, others anticipated that the effects of energy price declines and the dollar\u2019s appreciation would continue to weigh on inflation in the near term, suggesting that conditions likely would not be appropriate to begin raising rates until later in the year, and a couple of participants suggested that the economic outlook likely would not call for liftoff until 2016.\u201d The lingering impact of a frigid winter and lower oil prices leading to job cuts in the booming domestic oil market may have impacted the numbers. New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley said on Wednesday that he was not overly concerned with one month\u2019s jobs report but that the economic growth was slowing. \u201cClearly the economy is growing slower and there\u2019s less pressure on the labor market,\u201d Dudley said during an event presented by Thomson Reuters. Dudley said it would be \u201creasonable to expect that the timing of the Fed\u2019s first rate hike might be a little further off in time\u201d. In a note to investors Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said it was now clear that Fed officials were split on whether to begin hiking the fed funds rate in June or to wait until some time in the second half of this year. \u201cThe weak March payroll figures may have tipped the balance on the FOMC [Federal open markets committee] in favour of waiting until September. But perhaps not if Fed officials chalked it up to the same transitory factors, such as the unseasonably cold weather, that some of them believe can explain the softness in first-quarter spending,\u201d he wrote. US stock markets shrugged off the news and were largely unchanged after the release of the minutes.",

    "webTitle": "Greece's Tsipras meets Putin in Moscow - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Before we close up, here is a summary of today\u2019s main events. Two key events have dominated. First, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was in Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin: At a joint press conference Tsipras said Greece was not in favour of Western sanctions imposed on Russia, adding that it risked the start of another Cold War Putin said that it was unfortunate the Greek economy had been hit by counter sanctions imposed by Russia, but no exceptions could be made for any country within the EU Putin said that Greece had not asked Russia for financial aid. But he added that Russia was willing to talk about investing in projects in Greece Austria warned Greece not to get too close to Russia The second major event was the news that Shell has agreed to buy BG Group for \u00a347bn. BG\u2019s new chief executive Helge Lund - in the job for just two months - could walk away with up to \u00a325m. Shares in BG soared, helping to push the FTSE 100 up 0.5% earlier in the day. The FTSE\u2019s gains were erased in later trading however, following other European indices lower. Thank you for reading the blog today and for all your comments. Please join us again tomorrow, when it\u2019s another deadline day for Greece. This time the Greek government must repay \u20ac450m of debt to the IMF. Have a great evening. AM The FTSE has been unable to hold on to gains made earlier, when it was boosted by news of Shell\u2019s proposed \u00a347bn takeover of BG Group. It has followed other markets lower, ahead of the latest set of minutes from the Fed\u2019s Open Market Committee (FOMC) tonight. FTSE 100: -0.3% at 6,944.57 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.7% at 12,039 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 5,136.54 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 23,583.03 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.8% at 11,637.5 US markets have opened up slightly: Dow Jones: +0.1% at 17,885.63 S&amp;P 500: +0.1% at 2,078.15 Nasdaq: +0.3% at 4,357.73 The press conference is over. It ended with a few comments on Greece\u2019s potential participation in the Turkish Stream pipeline project. Putin said nothing concrete was agreed, but Greece could potentially earn millions of euros every year from the project. The Russian President added that Greece\u2019s creditors would benefit should the Greek economy improve as a result of closer ties with Russia. Putin said that it is unfortunate that counter sanctions imposed by Russia on the West have affected Greece. But we cannot make any exceptions for any country in the European Union. He says he does not understand why such a fuss is being made about the Greek PMs visit to Russia [I\u2019m paraphrasing there. AM]. Tsipras has just said that hostile relations between the West and Russia could lead to another Cold War. The counter sanctions imposed by Russia have inflicted pain on the Greek economy. But we know the retaliations were a response to sanctions (against Russia), the logic of which we do not entirely share. We openly disapproved of the sanctions. It is not an efficient solution. We think it could bring about a new Cold War between Russia and the West. Putin says Greece has not asked for financial aid from Russia. He adds Russia is ready to bid for projects in infrastructure in Greece, and all it would ask for is that Russian companies are not viewed any less favourably than companies bidding from other countries. Tsipras says it is not a Greek crisis it is a European crisis, and that is why the solution must be a European solution. Vladimir Putin: A major part of Greece\u2019s relations with Russia is tourism. Greece is one of the most popular destinations for Russians. Last year Greek resorts and other attractions were visited by one million Russians. The Greek PM Alexis Tsipras thanks Putin for his hospitality. We have discussed in detail how we can boost Greek exports to Russia, covering the huge negative trade balance. And how we can attract Russian investment into the Greek economy... branches such as tourism, infrastructure, and how we can further strengthen our cultural, scientific, educational, academic exchange ties. I once again want to say how important it is to restart and to forget the past. The live stream is here. Vladimir Putin says Greece and Russia have adopted a joint plan of action for 2015 and 2016. We agreed to pay more attention to co-operation in investment, so far the figures have been quite humble here. While we wait, an alternative view of the press conference room in the Kremlin. The definition of \u201cwill begin shortly\u201d is clearly open to interpretation... The Tsipras/Putin press conference will begin shortly... Live stream here. Greek shares are lower today, with the ATG index in Athens down 1.1% at 768.63. Elsewhere in Europe, markets remain mixed: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 6,981.42 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 12,089.6 France\u2019s CAC: flat at 5,152.27 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 23,673.99 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 11,702.3 The hotly-anticipated Putin/Tsipras press conference at the Kremlin has yet to kick off. The select few member of the press attending the event in Moscow are being kept waiting back stage. Russia Today (RT) is reporting that Russia is preparing to lift the embargo on Greek food imports. It reports: Greece has been hit especially hard by the ban, as more than 40 percent of Greek exports are to Russia. In 2013, more than \u20ac178 million in fruits and conserves were exported to Russia, according to the Greek fruit export association, Incofruit-Hellas. Up until the ban, Russia had been Greece\u2019s biggest single trading partner worth $12.5 billion (\u20ac9.3 billion) by 2013, more than double the 2009 figure. On March 3, Greece sent a letter to the Russian food watchdog Roselkhoznadzor requesting the temporary restrictions on agricultural products such as strawberries, kiwis, peaches, and seafood is lifted. Russia\u2019s agricultural food ban applies to EU countries and is not due to expire until August 2015, a year after the restrictions were imposed in response to Western sanctions. The ban also applies to the US, Australia, Canada, Japan, and Norway and includes meat, fish, chicken, cheese, milk, fruit, and vegetables. The Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith says tensions are running high back in Athens, as the highly political nature of PM Tsipras\u2019 trip to Moscow is closely scrutinised. She reports: The concerns raised by senior European officials, including Martin Schultz, the European parliament president over today\u2019s Tsipras-Putin talks are being described as \u201cunnecessary\u201d by Greek sources. \u201cGreece has the right to have a multi-dimensional foreign policy,\u201d Greek officials said as prime minister Alexis Tsipras began talks with president Vladimir Putin. \u201cThe noise\u201d made by European leaders was not only unheeded but tantamount to interference in the country\u2019s affairs. Athens not only wanted to improve ties economically but culturally with Moscow, said another source adding that 2016 had been declared the Year of Greek-Russian friendship. Tsipras himself gave voice to the desire to strengthen ties with the Greek media quoting him as telling Putin that relations between the two countries were not only \u201cdeep and continuous\u201d but based on \u201ccommon struggles and a common religious tradition.\u201d \u201cThe aim of my presence here is to look to reset Greek-Russian relations to the benefit of both countries and to the benefit of security and stability in the wider region,\u201d the leftist prime minister told the Russian president. City University\u2019s Professor Anastasia Nesvetailova says that Russia would be in no position to bail out Greece, but argues there are other options on the table. It is difficult to imagine that the current enthusiasm about Greece-Russia relations will mature into Russia\u2019s tangible economic aid to Greece. Certainly not on the scale that can solve Greece\u2019s financial problems. The crisis-stricken Russian economy at present can ill-afford to extend financial aid to Greece. But some economic concessions, like a subsidised price for Russian gas transported through the newly planned Turkish Stream pipeline, or Russian purchases of failing Greek companies, are on the table. To Russia, the economic gains on many of these potential investments to Russia are questionable. And it is clear that both sides are using this moment for short-term political gesticulation directed at the EU. The best case scenario for Greece that can come out of Tsipras\u2019s visit to Moscow would be the removal of the food embargo on Greek agricultural exports to Russia, Russia\u2019s financial participation in the privatisation of Greek enterprises and reduced tariffs on Russian gas. A bilateral trade deal will boost some economic sectors in Russia. But beyond this, friendship with a ruined Greek economy will ultimately add to the pressures on the ailing economy of Russia. Back to Shell\u2019s \u00a347bn takeover of BG Group for a moment. The deal has been agreed just two months after Helge Lund joined BG as its new chief executive on 9 February. Once the deal with Shell is sealed, Lund will leave the company, taking up to \u00a325m with him. It begs the question, did Lund know about the Shell approach when he took on the BG job? Apparently not. This from the Guardian\u2019s Sean Farrell, who is at a press conference on the deal. The two leaders are expected to give a press conference at 15.30 Moscow time. In the meantime, the Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker brings this report from the Russian capital: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has begun talks with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin, the main event of a two-day trip to the Russian capital which has raised eyebrows in the EU. The meeting in Moscow comes a day before cash-strapped Greece is due to make a major payment to the International Monetary Fund. Tsipras arrived in Moscow on Tuesday, and on Wednesday morning laid flowers in a ceremony at a World War Two monument outside the Kremlin. He was due to make a joint appearance with Putin at a press conference in the Kremlin in the afternoon, after their talks had concluded. In Tsipras, Moscow sees a potential ally on a continent where it has few of them. The wooing of the new Greek government is part of a strategy in Moscow to seek out whatever forces may help to break the consensus in Europe that Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea and east Ukraine require a tough, sustained response. Already, Moscow has reached out to European far right groups, including by giving a \u20ac9m loan to France\u2019s Front National. On the eve of his visit to Moscow, Tsipras reiterated his opposition to EU sanctions on Russia, calling them \u201ca road to nowhere\u201d in an interview with TASS news agency. \u201cI support the point of view that there is a need for a dialogue and diplomacy, we should sit down at the negotiating table and find the solutions to major problems.\u201d In Brussels, the visit will be watched with trepidation, for fear the Russians could make Tsipras an offer he cannot refuse. Bookmaker Paddy Power is offering odds of 5/4 that Greece will accept more than \u20ac1bn in a bailout from Russia in 2015. Germany has no reason to believe Greece has changed its stance on supporting Russian sanctions, a German foreign ministry spokeswoman said. Speaking ahead of Alexis Tsipras\u2019 meeting with Vladimir Putin this afternoon, she said: So far there is no reason to think in concrete terms that the position of Greece has changed. So far Greece has supported all the decisions linked to sanctions and we hope that will continue to be the case. More on the news that Aldi has overtaken Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s sixth-largest supermarket chain. Aldi\u2019s share of the market has risen to 5.3% according to market researcher Kantar Worldpanel, compared with 5.1% for Waitrose, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership. This from the Guardian\u2019s Sarah Butler: Aldi has grown rapidly in recent years as shoppers have kept a tight rein on their budgets. Having leapfrogged Waitrose, it is now closing in on the Co-op, the UK\u2019s fifth-largest supermarket chain, which is now less than one percentage point ahead of the German chain in terms of market share. Waitrose\u2019s sales rose 2.9%, a relatively strong performance in a market which expanded by just 1%. But that was not enough to prevent the upmarket grocer being overtaken by Aldi, which was by far the top performer in a tough market where grocery prices fell by 2%. Fellow discounter Lidl also saw strong growth, with sales up 12.1%, taking its market share to 3.7%. The two German grocery chains now have a combined market share of 9%, up from 5.4% only three years ago. Supermarket sector: market share Tesco 29.4% Asda 17.1% Sainsbury\u2019s 16.4% Morrisons 10.9% The Co-op 6.0% Aldi 5.3% Waitrose 5.1% Lidl 3.7% Wow. Nice work if you can get it? Helge Lund, BG Group\u2019s new chief executive (he joined on 9 February) is in line for up to \u00a325m once the \u00a347bn deal with Shell is sealed. The Guardian\u2019s Julia Kollewe: The International Monetary Fund has made \u20ac2.5bn (\u00a31.8bn) of profit from its loans to Greece since 2010, according to the Jubilee Debt Campaign. This is how the JDC makes its calculation: The IMF has been charging an effective interest rate of 3.6% on its loans to Greece. This is far more than the interest rate the institution needs to meet all its costs, currently around 0.9%. If this was the actual interest rate Greece had been paying the IMF since 2010, it would have spent \u20ac2.5bn less on payments. Out of its lending to all countries in debt crisis between 2010 and 2014 the IMF has made a total profit of \u20ac8.4bn, over a quarter of which is effectively from Greece. All of this money has been added to the Fund\u2019s reserves, which now total \u20ac19bn. These reserves would be used to meet the costs from a country defaulting on repayments. Greece\u2019s total debt to the IMF is currently \u20ac24bn. Tim Jones, economist at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, said the \u201cusurious interest\u201d imposed by the IMF \u201cadds to the unjust debt forced on the people of Greece\u201d. Here is the timetable for Alexis Tsipras\u2019 meeting with Vladimir Putin this afternoon in Moscow. All in local time. 13.00 - the two leaders meet 14.00 - working lunch 15.15 - documents signed 15.30 - press conference Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Athens, brings us this update on Tsipras\u2019 visit to Moscow. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is accompanied by a delegation that includes veterans from World War II. The former communist party youth leader is determined to display his leftist credentials on his trip to Moscow. Photographs this morning show him being accompanied by the Marxist energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, and the families of World War II veterans. Many communists were banished to the former Soviet Union and other countries in the Communist bloc after the 1946-49 Greek civil war which followed the Nazi occupation of Greece. Tsipras\u2019 radical left Syriza party has traditionally had strong ties with the Russian left. Lafazanis, who leads Syriza\u2019s militant wing, has pushed forcefully for improved ties with Moscow. Reflecting the controversial and highly political nature of Tsipras\u2019s meeting with Putin in Moscow later today, the Austrian finance minister has fired a warning shot in Greece\u2019s direction. Speaking in Vienna, Hans Joerg Schelling suggested Greece should be careful in its dealings with Russia, at a time when Greece is almost out of money and trying to negotiate a deal with its eurozone partners. The minister said: It\u2019s perfectly normal for talks to take place but I would urgently warn against getting closer. We are in the middle of final negotiations for financing for Greece and I don\u2019t believe that a good game is being played here. Big moment for UK supermarkets as the German discount chain Aldi overtakes Waitrose to become Britain\u2019s sixth largest supermarket, according to market researcher Kantar Worldpanel. More soon. As Alexis Tsipras begins his controversial visit to Moscow, a Greek government official has insisted the prime minister will not be seeking financial aid from Russia when he meets Putin later today. Greece is still focused on resolving its debt crisis with its existing lenders, the official told Reuters. We have not asked for financial aid. We want to solve our issues of debt ... within the eurozone. The official added that the two leaders would discuss economic co-operation and bilateral investment and exports. European parliament president Martin Schulz warned Tsipras before he travelled not to break with the EU line on sanctions imposed on Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis. The Greek official said: Greece knows what to do within the EU framework but every country also has the sovereign right to look after and improve its bilateral relations. Investors in Europe have mixed feelings this morning. The FTSE was briefly back above 7,000, but has fallen back a bit. FTSE 100: +0.5% at 6,995.4 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.4% at 12,077.76 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,143.97 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: flat at 23,708.91 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 11,738.8 More reaction is coming in on the Shell/BG Group \u00a347bn mega deal. Marc Kimsey, senior trader at Accendo Markets, has sent a note entitled oil m&amp;a - we\u2019re just getting started: The deal between Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group will prompt sector consolidation. The decline in oil price over the past year has battered some stocks which are clearly now looking attractive. In the last year BG shares fell 30%, shares in Tullow Oil have fallen 65%, Premier Oil down 55%, and Petrofac down 20%. By comparison sector behemoths BP and Royal Dutch Shell have only shed 10% over the same period leaving them in the position of predator rather than prey. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, says Shell\u2019s move on BG is opportunistic: Whether precipitated by the falling oil price or BG\u2019s more recent production woes, Shell has acted opportunistically, as it previously implied it might if the occasion arose. Already the largest FTSE 100 constituent by a considerable margin, this deal will further consolidate Shell\u2019s position in that regard. There are clear attractions from Shell\u2019s viewpoint, including its additional exposure to liquified natural gas, almost immediate cost synergies and, in due course, asset sales from a partial break up of BG\u2019s operations. The projected price being paid for BG does not quite match the company\u2019s previous high of 1551p in March 2011, since when the shares have fallen 41%, 20% of which is in the last year alone. Nonetheless, the combined cash and shares offer will not, it would appear, dilute the cash generative abilities of the combined entity, with a substantial share buyback programme pencilled in for 2017 and beyond. In terms of the energy sector itself, the deal could also prompt other companies who have been running the slide rule over potential targets to make their move. The FTSE 100 is up 0.5% at 6,998.64. Top performers: Bottom performers: Big spike in BG shares this morning, up 42% at \u00a313 following confirmation that Shell wants to buy the company for \u00a347bn. Shell shares opened down 2.9% at \u00a321.45. Meanwhile BP shares have opened up 4.4% at 474.85p Shell boss Ben van Beurden told has told reporters that Helge Lund will \u201cprobably move along\u201d if the deal goes ahead. Lund only joined in February... It is also a big day for Greece, following the arrival in Moscow of prime minister Alexis Tsipras for a meeting with Vladimir Putin later today. The meeting comes a day before Greece must make a \u20ac450m debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has vowed to meet the deadline. We will be bringing you updates on Greece throughout the day. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The mega deal is back. The big corporate news this morning is that oil giant Royal Dutch Shell has announced that it has agreed to buy gas group BG for \u00a347bn. The full statement is here. The cash and shares deal will undoubtedly excite investors and analysts this morning as the various implications of such a major deal are absorbed. Our story on the deal is here, and we\u2019ll be brining you more details and reaction throughout the day. This is what the key players had to say in this morning\u2019s statement... Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Shell: Bold, strategic moves shape our industry. BG and Shell are a great fit. This transaction fits with our strategy and our read on the industry landscape around us. BG will accelerate Shell\u2019s financial growth strategy, particularly in deep water and liquefied natural gas: two of Shell\u2019s growth priorities and areas where the company is already one of the industry leaders. Furthermore, the addition of BG\u2019s competitive natural gas positions makes strategic sense, ahead of the long-term growth in demand we see for this cleaner-burning fuel. This transaction will be a springboard for a faster rate of portfolio change, particularly in exploration and other long term plays. We will be concentrating on fewer themes, and at a larger scale, to drive profitability and balance risk, and unlock more value from the combined portfolios. Over time, the combination will enhance our free cash flow potential, and our capacity to undertake share buybacks, where I expect to see a substantial increase in pace. Helge Lund, chief executive of BG: The offer from Shell delivers attractive returns to shareholders and has strong strategic logic. BG\u2019s deep water positions and strengths in exploration, liquefaction and liquified natural gas shipping and marketing will combine well with Shell\u2019s scale, development expertise and financial strength. The consolidated business will be strongly placed to develop the growth projects in BG\u2019s portfolio. The transaction will take time to complete, during which my team and I will remain committed to BG and our shareholders, and to safely delivering our 2015 business plan. Helge Lund only joined BG as chief executive on 9 February, so he hasn\u2019t wasted much time. The company came under fire for offering Lund a \u00a325m package to take the job, and was forced into an embarrassing u-turn.",

It believes that \u201cherding\u201d behaviour \u2013 as fund managers charge into the same asset classes simultaneously in order to hit their performance targets \u2013 is \u201cprevalent and increasing\u201d \u2013 particularly in emerging market assets. This herding can lead to sudden reversals as market conditions change, and the tendency of individual investors to pull their money out of under-performing funds can give these laggards an incentive to take bigger risks, the authors argue. The report also claims that clients of fund management firms can sometimes have an incentive to get out fast when trouble strikes, posing another risk. \u201cSome factors point to the existence of incentives to run in segments of the industry.\u201d \u201cLarge-scale sales by funds may exert significant downward asset-price pressures, which could affect the entire market and trigger adverse feedback loops,\u201d it warns. The IMF suggests that as well as checking up on the safety of financial products to prevent customers being ripped off, watchdogs should look more closely at how they might affect market stability \u2013 forcing them to hold more liquid assets, and subjecting them to stress tests along the lines of those imposed on major banks, for example. The IMF is also concerned that in many cases, asset management firms are owned by large banks, creating what it calls \u201cpotentially very influential and complex mega conglomerates\u201d. In a separate chapter of the GFSR, the IMF gives a cleaner bill of health to the global banking sector, which it says is tending to become more local, reducing the risks of cross-border shocks of the kind that rocked global financial markets in 2007 and 2008. \u201cThe relative shift on the part of foreign banks away from cross-border lending and toward more local lending \u2026 has a positive effect on the financial stability of host countries,\u201d it says.",

    "webTitle": "Shell agrees to buy BG Group for \u00a347bn", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to buy gas group BG for \u00a347bn after a plunging oil price prompted a swoop on its long-coveted takeover target. The takeover of BG, formerly the exploration arm of British Gas, will be the the energy sector\u2019s biggest for a decade and create a company worth almost \u00a3180bn. Shell is already Britain\u2019s largest company with a valuation of about \u00a3130bn and the combined group will be more than 50% bigger than the second largest HSBCcorporation. BG Group\u2019s chief executive, Helge Lund, who joined in early February, will leave once the deal goes through next year, and could walk away with more than \u00a325m. His pay deal sparked a shareholder revolt in November, forcing BG to link his earnings more closely with company performance. Lund, who stayed at BG\u2019s head office in Reading on Wednesday instead of facing analysts and investors in London, was hired to overhaul the company. But he may now receive a windfall for keeping BG ticking over until the deal is closed. The takeover also represents a multimillion pound pay day for the investment banks who advised the companies. Goldman Sachs and Robey Warshaw will get about \u00a333m each for advising BG, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch will receive \u00a355m for working for Shell, according to Thomson Reuters. The takeover, which must clear regulatory hurdles around the world including in Brussels and Australia, was hatched by Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, and Andrew Gould, the chairman of BG. Van Beurden said he called Gould on 15 March to suggest a deal and that negotiations moved quickly. Van Beurden said Lund would stay on at BG to manage the business but that he would \u201cdo his own thing\u201d once the deal was complete. \u201cI do not know Helge very well but I know him well enough to know that I had a good and constructive and transparent dialogue with him and he said, \u2018This is how I see it.\u2019 And that\u2019s perfectly OK,\u201d Van Beurden said. Gould said Lund had stayed in Reading to brief employees about the deal and that the two-hour drive to London was too time consuming for him to join him and the Shell bosses to present the takeover to the City. On Lund\u2019s pay, Gould said: \u201cThe shares Helge has been [awarded] are subject to performance conditions that will not be known until this transaction has completed. I\u2019m afraid you will have to wait until the deal has completed to know what the final number is going to be.\u201d There has been widespread speculation that BG would become a takeover target as part of a wave of deals in the sector. Many City analysts predicted Exxon of the US would make a move on the business. Gould declined to say whether any other companies had approached him about a takeover. Shell offered cash and shares worth \u00a313.50 per share \u2013 50% more than BG\u2019s market value on Tuesday night. It is the biggest oil and gas takeover since Shell\u2019s Dutch and British arms were formally merged in 2004, and the 10th biggest mergers and acquisitions deal ever, according to data from Thomson Reuters. BG\u2019s share price surged 27% to \u00a312.06 on the news, while Shell shares fell 8.6% to \u00a321.16. Van Beurden said the hefty premium Shell was paying was not outlandish in the energy sector and that the low oil price had presented an opportunity to buy BG, whose shares had fallen by more than a quarter since the oil price began its slide last June. \u201cThe logic has always been compelling. Of course the environment today has made the value piece of its a whole lot more compelling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been looking at BG for a long time and we thought this was the right time to move.\u201d He added that the combined business will sell off \u00a320bn of assets from each company between 2016 and 2018, most of which will be returned to investors via a \u00a317bn share buyback. Shell, whose interests include operations in Malaysia, the North Sea and Nigeria, said the deal would create pretax cost savings of about \u00a31.7bn a year. It will add some 25% to the company\u2019s proved oil and gas reserves and 20% to production, as well as strengthening its position in new oil and gas projects, particularly in liquified natural gas [LNG] in Australia and deepwater production off Brazil. BG and Shell both have huge interests in the LNG market, which allows gas to be shipped around the world in tankers. Like other oil and gas companies, BG has been hit hard by falling oil prices. A glut of oil and weak demand has caused the price to fall nearly 50%, to around $59 a barrel, since last summer. The company\u2019s profits were down nearly 20%, to just over $900m, in the three months to the end of last year. Shell has also been affected by falling oil prices. Only two weeks ago the Anglo-Dutch business unveiled 250 job cuts in the North Sea and changes to shift patterns for workers to cut costs. But Van Beurden said the company was committed to the North Sea and would invest \u00a34bn between 2016 and 2018. Asked if he could guarantee no further North Sea job losses from the deal, Van Beurden said: \u201cThere are no guarantees in life. Irrespective of what happens [with the BG deal], we will have to look at how we make the North Sea a strong and healthy [site] again.\u201d How the companies compare Royal Dutch Shell \u2022 Founded in 1907 when Royal Dutch merged with Shell. Based in The Hague \u2022 Chief executive Ben van Beurden has been with firm for 32 years. Last year he was paid \u20ac24m. \u2022 Biggest company in the FTSE-100, with market value \u00a3130bn \u2022 Made $15bn profit in 2014 \u2022 Has 92,000 staff \u2022 Produces: 3m+ barrels, oil equivalent, a day \u2022 Wants BG because it needs more reserves and wants to be bigger in gas industry BG Group \u2022 Formerly the upstream business of state-owned British Gas.

Irrespective of what happens [with the BG deal], we will have to look at how we make the North Sea a strong and healthy [site] again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"All-time largest corporate takeovers and mergers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1428509607695/largest_deals_all.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>How the companies compare</h2> <p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Founded in 1907 when Royal Dutch merged with Shell.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s banks have come under renewed pressure to not fund the country\u2019s largest coal projects after three of France\u2019s leading financial institutions ruled out providing capital for the developments. In response to questions from French climate activists, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and BNP Paribas all said they will not be involved in proposed mines for the coal-rich Galilee Basin region of central Queensland. Letters from the banks rule out the mines, which include developments from Clive Palmer\u2019s Waratah Coal and Adani\u2019s $16.5bn Carmichael project. BNP Paribas\u2019 letter extended this to \u201crelated dedicated infrastructure projects\u201d. This could refer to a new rail line needed to take coal to the Abbot Point port, which is set to be expanded as part of the developments. A total of 11 international banks have publicly distanced themselves from the Galilee Basin projects in one form or another, including HSBC, Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Citi. The coal projects are opposed by environmentalists due to the huge volume of greenhouse gas emissions they will create, as well as concerns over the impact upon the Great Barrier Reef. Minerals will be exported overseas from Abbot Point, which lies adjacent to the reef. The mining industry, however, has stressed that the projects are crucial in creating thousands of jobs in Queensland as well as billions of dollars in taxes. The industry has also said concerns over increased shipping and associated dredging and dumping of seabed sediment for port expansion have been overblown. According to an analysis by fossil fuel divestment group Market Forces, French banks were the fifth largest source of debt finance for Australian fossil fuel projects between 2008 and 2014. \u201cRegardless of how Adani is attempting to secure finance for its Carmichael mega coalmine and new export terminal at Abbot Point, it is inevitable that this project will require a syndicate of major international banks contributing to a debt facility,\u201d said Julien Vincent, lead campaigner at Market Forces. \u201cFor 11 of the world\u2019s \u2018go-to\u2019 banks for coal finance to now be out of the picture means the options available to Adani for the billions of dollars of debt it will need are severely limited.\u201d Climate group 350.org is to kick off a fresh campaign to pressure the Commonwealth Bank to rule out funding for the Carmichael project. The activist organisation has previously highlighted CBA chairman David Turner\u2019s directorship role with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation in an attempt to make the bank distance itself from the project. \u201cThe actions of major banks from overseas really highlights the silence from Australian banks on this issue,\u201d said Charlie Wood, campaigns director at 350.org. \u201cThere are so many things risky about this project, at a time when we should be peaking our emissions. Australian banks need to follow the example of overseas banks and say no.\u201d None of the \u201cbig four\u201d Australian banks \u2013 ANZ, CBA, Westpac and NAB \u2013 have publicly ruled out funding the Carmichael project and Adani has consistently maintained that it will ensure funding for the mine, which will remove up to 60m tonnes of coal a year for export. An Adani spokesman said: \u201cThe company continues to progress the financing arrangements for its projects in Australia. \u201cAdani has not formally requested any financing from the institutions you have referred to. An institution ruling out something it was not requested to do has no bearing on this company. \u201cAdani\u2019s projects in Queensland comply with the strictest environmental conditions in a world\u2019s best practice environmental approvals framework.\u201d A spokeswoman for CBA declined to comment directly about funding Galilee Basin projects. Instead, she said in a statement: \u201cWe recognise that we play a crucial role in enabling economic and social development of Australia supporting jobs, growth, innovation and opportunities for people and businesses. \u201cWe also recognise our role in addressing the challenge of climate change, including helping organisations to transition to a low-carbon economy, investing in renewables and ensuring we have robust responsible lending practices in place.\u201d \u201cWe have a robust approach to responsible lending for any project, no matter where it is.\u201d",

BG shares had fallen by nearly a third in the last year prior to today\u2019s announcement, as the company\u2019s exposure to a series of troubled projects in Brazil and costs associated with the launch of a new Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project in Australia weighed on the shares. </p> <p>Shell is taking on more risk in issuing more shares and also in paying out cash to BG shareholders.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets This morning\u2019s news ... has given the beleaguered oil and gas sector a much needed shot in the arm after 18 months of significant underperformance. While the size of the deal is certainly noteworthy, it\u2019s the second biggest deal of its kind, behind the 1998 Exxon Mobil tie up, it also speaks to the damage the sharp decline in the oil price has done to a number of big oil players in the last few months, making the sector ripe for consolidation. It also raises expectations as to which other companies could also come into play as the oil and gas sector gears up for further consolidation, with speculation surrounding Tullow Oil, whose shares have lost 60% since the beginning of 2014 and BP. The last time we saw deals of this size was in 1998 when Exxon and Mobil merged at a cost of $73bn and BP bought Amoco for $48.2bn. We\u2019ve seen the oilfield services sector start the ball rolling at the end of last year with US company Halliburton announcing it was merging with US rival Baker Hughes, with a price tag of $34bn. In the past 12 months, the oil majors have had to deal with the consequences of events in Ukraine and the Crimea as well as western government sanctions on Russia and the effects these sanctions have had on the profitability of their assets exposed to those sanctions. Early last year, Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s CEO, Ben Van Beurden, announced a significant sharper focus on costs and unnecessary capital expenditure. The company also warned on profits for the first time in a decade... The company\u2019s most recent numbers were encouraging, showing that cashflow had improved by 11% and earnings were up 14%, suggesting that Van Beurden\u2019s strategy of targeted cost cutting appeared to be bearing fruit, despite the lower oil price. This does appear to be reflected in the share price performance since the beginning of 2014, which shows that Royal Dutch Shell is among the better performers in the sector, in stark contrast to its target BG Group. It would appear that Shell is looking at BG Group\u2019s LNG assets as it looks to diversify further away from its core oil business, at a time when new exploration for both oil and gas is becoming increasingly expensive in terms of cost versus returns. Given that BG Group is one of the world leaders in LNG and recently completed a $20bn facility in Australia, the acquisition here could well draw a line under a turbulent time for BG Group, which has struggled with management uncertainty over the last 18 months, and in the process given shareholders a rather torrid time.",

      "bodyText": "Aldi has overtaken Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s sixth-largest supermarket chain by market share, continuing the discounter\u2019s rapid push into mainstream grocery retailing. The German chain increased sales by 16.8% in the 12 weeks to 29 March, according to the latest figures from Kantar Worldpanel. That took Aldi\u2019s share of the market up to 5.3%, compared with 5.1% for Waitrose, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership. Waitrose\u2019s sales rose 2.9%, a relatively strong performance in a market which expanded by just 1%. But that growth was not enough to prevent the upmarket grocer being overtaken by Aldi, whose pace of growth far outstripped a tough market in which grocery prices overall fell by 2%. Sales fell at bigger rivals Asda and Morrisons and barely scraped into growth at Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, rising by 0.3% and 0.2% respectively. Aldi, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary in the UK, has considerably stepped up growth in recent years as shoppers have tried out new stores to save money. Having leapfrogged Waitrose, it is now closing in on the Co-op \u2013 which is now less than one percentage point ahead in terms of market share. If current trends continue, in a year Aldi could overtake the Co-op to become the UK\u2019s fifth biggest grocer, according to Fraser McKevitt at Kantar Worldpanel. Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Tesco are much further ahead, however. Aldi\u2019s fellow discounter Lidl also saw strong growth, with sales up 12.1%, taking its market share to 3.7%. The combined market share of the two German chains is 9%, up from 5.4% three years ago. It puts the share of the market held by discounters at its highest level since 1999, when Kwik Save was still in existence and Danish discounter Netto had a bigger presence in Britain. At their peak, in the early 1990s, the discounters together controlled about 11% of the UK grocery market. McKevitt said the German chains were on track to considerably beat that. \u201cAldi and Lidl\u2019s rates of growth will continue to come down but they are still ahead of the rest of the industry. We have had big discounters in the UK market before but what\u2019s different about Aldi and Lidl is they are both massive international retailers and private companies investing in many more stores,\u201d McKevitt said. On Wednesday, Aldi confirmed plans to quadruple the number of its stores in London, with nine new outlets including a second trial of a convenience-style outlet in Tooting. The group has 560 stores in Britain and wants 1,000 by 2022. A spokesman for Aldi said the supermarket was \u201ccommitted to investing in the UK and Greater London is a key area of growth for the business\u201d. Some commentators believe discounters could in future control as much as 20% of the UK market. In Germany, Aldi and Lidl account for almost 40% of food and grocery sales. Many believe the two chains will continue to gain share in the UK even as consumers\u2019 disposable income improves because frugal shopping habits have become entrenched after years of falling living standards. The German chains\u2019 international scale also means they can offer a much more sophisticated experience than outfits such as Kwik Save did in the past, enabling them to appeal to middle-class shoppers as well as those on a tight budget. \u201cWhen you go to a discounter, you don\u2019t feel like you are a loser,\u201d said Patrick O\u2019Brien of the retail analysis firm Verdict Retail. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily feel that if you had a bit more money you would be shopping elsewhere.\u201d Cultural change has been fuelled by the internet, he said, with websites such as Money Saving Expert helping make savvy shopping fashionable. It is the same trend that has enabled the rise of Primark, Poundland and B&amp;M. \u201cThere is now a more confrontational attitude between retailers and consumers,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has evolved. There is a danger that attitude will move back out of fashion but I\u2019m not sure that is a key driver.\u201d Supermarket sector by market share Tesco 29.4% Asda 17.1% Sainsbury\u2019s 16.4% Morrisons 10.9% The Co-op 6.0% Aldi 5.3% Waitrose 5.1% Lidl 3.7%",
