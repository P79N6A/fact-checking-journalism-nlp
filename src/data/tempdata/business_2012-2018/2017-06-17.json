      "bodyText": "As the sun shone on millions of solar panels and unseasonable gusts turned thousands of turbine blades last Sunday, something remarkable happened to Britain\u2019s power grid. For a brief period, a record 70% of the electricity for the UK\u2019s homes and businesses was low-carbon, as nuclear, solar and wind crowded out coal and even gas power stations. That afternoon was a glimpse into the future, of how energy provision will look in 13 years\u2019 time because of binding carbon targets. On what one grid manager called \u201cstunning Sunday\u201d, the carbon intensity of producing power \u2013 a key measure of progress towards climate goals \u2013 dropped below the \u201cmagic number\u201d of 100g of CO2 per kilowatt hour for the first time. That\u2019s the level that must be the norm by 2030, according to the government\u2019s climate advisers. Yet last Sunday was just one of a run of striking records for renewable power in Britain that pose profound questions for conventional generators and the companies which manage power grids. On one Friday in May, solar power briefly eclipsed the UK\u2019s eight nuclear power stations. The grid recently went without coal for an entire day for the first time, and the dirty fuel is now regularly absent from power supply for hours at a time. These milestones are having tangible effects. Solar cuts power demand for National Grid, reducing prices, while wind power also lowers prices. That led to another first last week, when high wind output pushed down the wholesale price and resulted in negative power prices, which means some conventional power plants had to pay household suppliers like British Gas to take their electricity. \u201cThis has surprised people,\u201d said John Feddersen, chief executive of analysts Aurora Energy Research, referring to the speed at which negative prices had arrived in the UK. In Germany, lower power prices driven by the country\u2019s green energy boom have wiped billions off the share prices of energy giants E.ON and RWE. But will the likes of EDF and British Gas owner Centrica, which own nuclear and gas plants, face the same fate in the UK? Feddersen argues that there are two reasons why this will not happen. One is the UK\u2019s \u201ccapacity market\u201d, which has been set to cope with power shortages as coal plants have closed and renewables have made supplies more intermittent. A new scheme will pay conventional power station owners \u00a3378m in subsidies this winter to be on standby and ensure the lights stay on. The other is the payments from National Grid to fossil fuel plants for services that are vital to national power supply, such as \u201cblackstart\u201d \u2013 the ability to restart the nation\u2019s power grid in the event of a catastrophic, widespread loss of energy supplies. Odd as it may sound, power station owners no longer make money out of power, but from these other mechanisms. \u201cThis is the new world for how the system\u2019s meant to work in the UK. Generators know you\u2019re not going to get your investment back in the energy market,\u201d said Feddersen. \u201cWe won\u2019t actually see the share-price impacts in the UK that we\u2019ve seen in Germany,\u201d he said. The capacity market is the main reason why. Rob Lalor, senior analyst at EnAppSys, which monitors energy supply, said: \u201cThe big difference between the UK and Germany is they\u2019ve [conventional operators] been given the opportunity to make money [through the capacity market].\u201d So far, the low prices seen in the UK during renewable output surges were relatively infrequent and had had limited impact, he said. But that will change as such events become more common \u2013 records will continue to be broken because of a pipeline of offshore windfarms being plugged into the grid. However, it is clear that the growth of renewables has made prices a lot spikier than they used to be. As well as low or negative prices during high wind and solar periods, prices can leap very high when wind doesn\u2019t materialise as forecast. Day-ahead power prices in May averaged \u00a341 per megawatt hour, but dipped just below zero early on 7 June during a period of high wind output. Prices also rose as high as nearly \u00a383 in May. \u201cWhat you see with more wind and solar in the market is a lot more volatility of prices in the day,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Touati of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a US energy research body. He has seen the same phenomenon in California, where the two technologies now play a key role in determining price. In the UK, the rise of renewables is also creating new challenges for the people who manage local and national power grids. Robert Gross, director of the centre for energy policy and technology at Imperial College, said fossil fuel plants were having to ramp up and down more quickly to adjust to wind and solar output. \u201cMy understanding is that\u2019s not causing any insurmountable problems [for the grid]. The way I heard it characterised is the National Grid control room now finds summer to be more worrisome than January nights. Now it\u2019s the [challenge of] solar and low demand on very sunny days [rather than high demand days in winter].\u201d His research shows that costs for managing the grid \u2013 balancing supply and demand as the energy supply becomes more variable \u2013 will not rise prohibitively until the UK has at least twice as much wind and solar power as it does now. But for some observers, such as credit agency Moody\u2019s, wind and solar presents a long-term risk to Europe\u2019s energy networks. \u201cThe growing share of electricity from renewables has already had adverse effects on incumbent generators and energy networks are not immune,\u201d it said in a report this week. But Duncan Burt, who oversees daily operations at the National Grid, is sanguine about the renewable records. \u201cIt\u2019s one of these things where we\u2019ve tipped through a threshold. But the work we\u2019ve done to get ready for this has paid off,\u201d he said, citing a grid-run scheme that encourages large energy users to increase their demand during summer periods of low demand and high wind and solar output. The UK isn\u2019t done with records this year yet, Burt thinks, suggesting solar could go higher and carbon intensity might go even lower than the 90g CO2 per kWh last Sunday, to as low as 80g. \u201cI think we will beat them several times this summer.\u201d Germany\u2019s view When Angela Merkel announced in 2011 that Germany would seek to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2022, questions arose as to whether renewable sources of energy, such as wind or solar, could grow quickly enough to meet the requirements of German industry. Yet six years later, renewable power stations across the country are producing power in such abundance that conventional providers relying on coal and gas are being squeezed out of the market, and the state has to pay some renewable energy companies to switch off their turbines to stop congesting the power grid. On one particularly sunny but windy day, on 8 May 2016, a record 87.6% of Germany\u2019s energy needs were met by renewables: an inspirational achievement, were it not for conventional power stations continuing to produce energy at their usual rate. As a knock-on effect of the oversupply, energy market prices collapsed, adding further volatility to a rapidly changing the environment for energy companies. E.ON, Germany\u2019s biggest utility, reported a record loss of \u20ac16bn (\u00a314bn) for 2016 and said it would have to cut around 1,300 jobs, 3% of its total workforce. The previous year, E.ON had already posted a loss of almost \u20ac7bn. Both E.ON and RWE, Germany\u2019s second-largest electricity provider, have reacted by radically restructuring their companies, splitting their renewable business from their fossil-fuel operations and selling stakes in the new operations to investors. E.ON hived off its gas and coal power stations into an entity called Uniper at the start of 2016. RWE moved its renewables business into \u201cRWE International\u201d on 1 April 2016. Cries of woe from lobbyists haven\u2019t gone unnoticed, and the future of Germany\u2019s big energy giants could feature in the upcoming federal elections in September. Some politicians from the pro-business wing of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats have called for an end to state subsidies for green energy by 2021. Providers of green energy don\u2019t receive \u201csubsidies\u201d in the sense of direct payments from the state, but are guaranteed a fixed price at which they can sell energy into the grid.

    "webTitle": "Philip Hammond under pressure to spend to lure voters back to Tories", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond is resisting Theresa May\u2019s demands for an end to austerity amid Treasury concerns that loosening the purse strings will lead to a black hole in the government\u2019s finances. The chancellor has used discussions with the prime minister since the election to press the case for a cautious approach to the public finances, despite the widespread view among Conservative MPs that seven years of spending cuts and pay restraint handed seats to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party. Hammond has already eased the pace of austerity since moving into the Treasury almost a year ago but is opposed to the idea that his planned planned autumn budget should result in far higher borrowing to fund new spending pledges. The pressure to ease up comes just as Hammond can trumpet some progress on cutting the deficit \u2013 which is the gap between what the government receives in income, such as through taxes, each year and what it spends. For the financial year just ended in March, the deficit was \u00a348.7bn, down a hefty \u00a323.4bn from the previous year. That was also \u00a33bn smaller than forecast at the time of Hammond\u2019s maiden budget in March. The government\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said in March that the deficit was expected to widen again this year to \u00a355.2bn but then shrink every year over the following four years. The public finances are still expected to be in the red well into the next decade. John Hawksworth, chief economist at consultancy group PwC, said: \u201cPeople are certainly fed up with austerity. The political rhetoric is going to change. The question is whether it will be reflected in the hard numbers.\u201d Carl Emmerson, at leading thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said any change of tack was likely to take the form of higher borrowing by the government. \u201cWe could see more borrowing because of the desire to spend a little more than current plans imply, and because of a lack of desire to put up taxes to pay for it,\u201d he said. Hammond and May must also consider whether the Conservatives should match Labour spending pledges, like scrapping tuition fees, that proved popular with young voters. But some economists point out that more spending will not necessarily translate into a much bigger hole in the public finances. Martin Beck, from the consultancy Oxford Economics, believes increasing borrowing to fund more spending or tax cuts would help the economy grow faster, which in turn could speed up deficit reduction. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong case for doing more fiscal loosening,\u201d said Beck. \u201cIt could boost demand. It might not be completely self-financing but the idea you wouldn\u2019t get more activity from more spending and tax cuts is silly and higher activity generates tax revenues.\u201d But Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said it was clear that Hammond took a different view and was unreceptive to the idea of permitting a big increase in the deficit. Bell said one way to pay for spending increases would be to delay some of the more expensive proposed tax cuts \u2013 raising the personal allowance, increasing the upper rate threshold and reducing corporation tax \u2013 that the government has lined up for the current parliament. Against this backdrop, some of the pressures on the chancellor include: Public sector pay The praise for the emergency services for the way in which they responded to the Manchester Arena bombing, the Borough Market attacks and the fire last week in Grenfell Tower has made it much tougher for the government to stick to its 1% pay ceiling in the public sector. If the cap held until its planned end in 2020, public sector workers would be earning less in real terms than in 2004-5, making it harder to recruit and retain staff. Cost: \u00a33bn for each percentage point increase in public sector pay. Schools The government has protected the budget for schools but a growing population means that funding per pupil is set to fall in the four years from 2015-16 to 2019-20. Labour said it would reverse these cuts and the education secretary, Justine Greening, will be pressing Hammond to do the same. Cost: \u00a34bn to ensure per pupil funding remains unchanged. Welfare George Osborne announced \u00a312bn of welfare cuts in his summer 2015 budget as part of his plan to put government finances back into the black by 2020. These included less generous child benefit, a freeze on in-work benefits and restrictions on housing benefit. Some changes have been introduced but most expected savings will occur in the new parliament. Cost: \u00a39bn to reverse welfare cuts due to come in during the current parliament. \u00a32bn: cost of Labour\u2019s planned social security package. Tax The election meant the government had to shelve a number of revenue-raising measures until after polling day. These would have been passed comfortably in the event of the expected large Tory majority but are now at the mercy of a hung parliament. These include the \u201cmaking tax digital\u201d programme aimed at putting more of the tax system online, restrictions on corporation tax relief and scrapping non-domicile status. Revenue: \u00a37.6bn in total: \u00a34bn from corporation tax; \u00a32.2bn from making tax digital; \u00a31.4bn from cracking down on non-doms. Tuition fees One of Labour\u2019s most popular policies was the pledge to scrap higher education tuition fees and reinstate maintenance grants, and the Tories might face pressure to match it if they are to secure a younger vote that could be the swing demographic in the next general election. Corbyn said he would fund this move by levying a 45% income tax on those earning more than \u00a380,000 and 50% tax on those earning more than \u00a3110,000. The Conservatives promised in their manifesto not to raise income tax. Cost: \u00a39bn NHS Spending on the NHS has been ring-fenced since 2010, sparing health from the deep cuts that have affected most other Whitehall departments. Even so, the NHS budget has increased by just over 1% a year on average since the last year of Gordon Brown\u2019s government \u2013 just one third of the average annual increase since it was founded in 1948. The Tory manifesto pledged an extra \u00a38bn for the NHS over the next five years, while Labour promised \u00a330bn. Cost: Around \u00a35bn a year to match Labour\u2019s commitment.",

      "body": "<p>Philip Hammond is resisting Theresa May\u2019s demands for an end to austerity amid Treasury concerns that loosening the purse strings will lead to a black hole in the government\u2019s finances.</p> <p>The chancellor has used discussions with the prime minister since the election to press the case for a cautious approach to the public finances, despite the widespread view among Conservative MPs that seven years of spending cuts and pay restraint handed seats to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party.</p> <p>Hammond has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/philip-hammond-brexit-vote-borrowing-autumn-statement\">eased the pace of austerity</a> since moving into the Treasury almost a year ago but is opposed to the idea that his planned planned autumn budget should result in far higher borrowing to fund new spending pledges.</p> <p>The pressure to ease up comes just as Hammond can trumpet some progress on cutting the deficit \u2013 which is the gap between what the government receives in income, such as through taxes, each year and what it spends. For the financial year just ended in March, the deficit was \u00a348.7bn, down a hefty \u00a323.4bn from the previous year. That was also \u00a33bn smaller than forecast at the time of Hammond\u2019s maiden budget in March.</p> <p>The government\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said in March that the deficit was expected to widen again this year to \u00a355.2bn but then shrink every year over the following four years. The public finances are still expected to be in the red well into the next decade.</p> <p>John Hawksworth, chief economist at consultancy group PwC, said: \u201cPeople are certainly fed up with austerity. The political rhetoric is going to change. The question is whether it will be reflected in the hard numbers.\u201d</p> <p>Carl Emmerson, at leading thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said any change of tack was likely to take the form of higher borrowing by the government. \u201cWe could see more borrowing because of the desire to spend a little more than current plans imply, and because of a lack of desire to put up taxes to pay for it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hammond and May must also consider whether the Conservatives should match Labour spending pledges, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/21/labour-abolish-university-tuition-fees-jeremy-corbyn-eu-uk-europe\">scrapping tuition fees</a>, that proved popular with young voters.</p> <p>But some economists point out that more spending will not necessarily translate into a much bigger hole in the public finances. Martin Beck, from the consultancy Oxford Economics, believes increasing borrowing to fund more spending or tax cuts would help the economy grow faster, which in turn could speed up deficit reduction.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a strong case for doing more fiscal loosening,\u201d said Beck. \u201cIt could boost demand. It might not be completely self-financing but the idea you wouldn\u2019t get more activity from more spending and tax cuts is silly and higher activity generates tax revenues.\u201d</p> <p>But Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said it was clear that Hammond took a different view and was unreceptive to the idea of permitting a big increase in the deficit. Bell said one way to pay for spending increases would be to delay some of the more expensive proposed tax cuts \u2013 raising the personal allowance, increasing the upper rate threshold and reducing corporation tax \u2013 that the government has lined up for the current parliament. Against this backdrop, some of the pressures on the chancellor include:</p> <h2><strong>Public sector pay</strong></h2> <p>The praise for the emergency services for the way in which they responded to the Manchester Arena bombing, the Borough Market attacks and the fire last week in Grenfell Tower has made it much tougher for the government to stick to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/18/public-sector-pay-tuc-midwives-teachers\">1% pay ceiling in the public sector</a>. If the cap held until its planned end in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/15/public-sector-workers-cut-pay-resolution-foundation\">public sector workers would be earning less in real terms than in 2004-5</a>, making it harder to recruit and retain staff.<br><strong>Cost: </strong>\u00a33bn for each percentage point increase in public sector pay.</p> <h2><strong>Schools</strong></h2> <p>The government has protected the budget for schools but a growing population means that funding per pupil is set to fall in the four years from 2015-16 to 2019-20. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/09/labour-pledges-6bn-annual-boost-to-school-budgets\">Labour said it would reverse these cuts</a> and the education secretary, Justine Greening, will be pressing Hammond to do the same.<br><strong>Cost: </strong> \u00a34bn to ensure per pupil funding remains unchanged.</p> <h2><strong>Welfare</strong></h2> <p>George Osborne announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/21/osborne-to-proceed-with-12bn-welfare-cuts-despite-anti-austerity-protests\">\u00a312bn of welfare cuts</a> in his summer 2015 budget as part of his plan to put government finances back into the black by 2020. These included less generous child benefit, a freeze on in-work benefits and restrictions on housing benefit. Some changes have been introduced but most expected savings will occur in the new parliament.<br><strong>Cost: </strong>\u00a39bn to reverse welfare cuts due to come in during the current parliament. \u00a32bn: cost of Labour\u2019s planned social security package.</p> <h2><strong>Tax</strong></h2> <p>The election meant the government had to shelve a number of revenue-raising measures until after polling day. These would have been passed comfortably in the event of the expected large Tory majority but are now at the mercy of a hung parliament. These include the \u201cmaking tax digital\u201d programme aimed at putting more of the tax system online, restrictions on corporation tax relief and scrapping non-domicile status.<br><strong>Revenue:</strong> \u00a37.6bn in total: \u00a34bn from corporation tax; \u00a32.2bn from making tax digital; \u00a31.4bn from cracking down on non-doms.</p> <h2><strong>Tuition fees</strong></h2> <p>One of Labour\u2019s most popular policies was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/21/labour-abolish-university-tuition-fees-jeremy-corbyn-eu-uk-europe\">pledge to scrap higher education tuition fees</a> and reinstate maintenance grants, and the Tories might face pressure to match it if they are to secure a younger vote that could be the swing demographic in the next general election. Corbyn said he would fund this move by levying a 45% income tax on those earning more than \u00a380,000 and 50% tax on those earning more than \u00a3110,000. The Conservatives promised in their manifesto not to raise income tax.<br><strong>Cost: </strong>\u00a39bn</p> <h2><strong>NHS</strong></h2> <p>Spending on the NHS has been ring-fenced since 2010, sparing health from the deep cuts that have affected most other Whitehall departments. Even so, the <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/nhs-in-a-nutshell/nhs-budget\">NHS budget has increased by just over 1% a year on average</a> since the last year of Gordon Brown\u2019s government \u2013 just one third of the average annual increase since it was founded in 1948. The Tory manifesto pledged an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2017/may/19/party-manifestos-nhs-general-election\">extra \u00a38bn for the NHS over the next five years</a>, while Labour promised \u00a330bn.<br><strong>Cost: </strong> Around \u00a35bn a year to match Labour\u2019s commitment.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Revealed: the Romanian site where Louis Vuitton makes its Italian shoes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Louis Vuitton\u2019s Italian shoes are the very height of luxury. Its Venice workshop claims to embody \u201cancestral savoir-faire\u201d in a region \u201crevered for its fine shoe craftsmanship\u201d. It is an image burnished by one of the biggest advertising budgets in the world. The Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) luxury group spent $4.4bn (\u00a33.45bn) last year on marketing its portfolio of top labels, which range from Moet &amp; Chandon champagne to Givenchy, TAG Heuer and Louis Vuitton shoes, adorned with the LV logo that is a global badge of wealth. This is, however, far from the full picture. Many of the shoes and boots it sells for between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,800 a pair and stamped as \u201cmade in Italy\u201d are mostly made in Transylvania, a region better known for vampires than any tradition of luxury craftsmanship. The factories are a well-kept secret, their identity closely guarded. The management says it has taken pains to ensure they do not turn up in a Google search. On the outside there is no mention of the brand \u2013 just a shadow of the Louis Vuitton checkerboard print, painted in grey on the factory walls. The name on the gate is Somarest, a little-known LVMH subsidiary. A French TV documentary team was turned back at these gates in 2014. Anonymous workers said entire shoes were made in Romania before being sent to Italy, where the soles were added. Bernard Arnault, LVMH\u2019s chief executive and France\u2019s richest man, rejected the claim. Now the Guardian can report from inside the factory for the first time, and can confirm that thousands of Louis Vuitton shoes leave their doors every week, complete in most details apart from the soles. When first contacting Somarest, the factory\u2019s communications officer hung up at the mention of Louis Vuitton and did not respond to any further attempt to contact her. Emails were forwarded to the head office in Paris. \u201cWe don\u2019t open the doors of our workshops due to internal policy,\u201d the company said. But Louis Vuitton has not been able to prevent clues about its Romanian operation from leaking on to the internet. A painstaking search through Romanian websites, including staff selfies on Facebook, eventually led to the factory door. Once you pass security and the cypress trees that stand sentry at the door to the Somarest factory in Cisnadie, a small town at the foot of the Southern Carpathian mountains, Louis Vuitton is omnipresent. At the top of the stairs is a glass case holding a pair of heritage leather boots embossed with the LV logo. They retail for $2,000. On the wall behind is a gallery of handbags on glass shelves. At the centre of the room is a trunk, a piece of the brand\u2019s history. Louis Vuitton made a name for himself creating these trunks for aristocrats in the 1850s. Today they are made to custom order on the outskirts of Paris, and cost upwards of $30,000. Exclusivity did not, however, make Louis Vuitton the 20th most valuable brand in the world. In the 1980s the company expanded to cater to a growing middle class, and now the brand makes most of its revenue from selling large amounts of product to the middle market. As a business model, mass-produced luxury has made Louis Vuitton so successful that it has now acquired 70 luxury houses.Just a few weeks ago it took control of Christian Dior. To keep profits high, the company had to lower production costs. This is what led it to Cisnadie, a pastel-hued town where EU flags fly from the lampposts along the main street. At one end is the kind of fortified church for which Transylvania is famed. At the other end is the Somarest factory. LVMH established its first plant here in 2002 to make the most of Romania\u2019s low-wage labour. By 2004, it was producing 1,500 pairs of shoe uppers a week, according to the online CV of the company\u2019s director at the time. Somarest was not willing to discuss how many shoes it currently produces, but the online CV of its operations manager claims production has increased 70% since 2007, which suggests annual output of well over 100,000 pairs. A second factory was built in nearby Avrig in 2009, also to make components for handbags and suitcases. A spokeswoman for the factory finally agreed to meet to discuss details of its production. Senior managers, she said, are French and the materials used are likewise imported from France. After assembly, she explained, the factory exports the goods to France and Italy, where they are \u201cfinished\u201d so that they qualify for a \u201cmade in France\u201d or \u201cmade in Italy\u201d label in accordance with EU law. The European parliament voted for compulsory \u201cmade in\u201d labels in 2014 to untangle the knotted thread of globalised production. For goods produced in more than one country, the country of origin is the one where the items underwent \u201cthe last, substantial, economically justified processing\u201d. Accordingly, the soles of the shoes are always added after they are exported. The Romanian factory affords visitors both a real and metaphorical window onto the production process, as a glass wall opens up the offices to the factory floor. Beyond the window, the work environment is clean and bright and the staff work sitting down. \u201cHere in Romania, these are things that the workers appreciate,\u201d the LV spokeswoman said, referring to the poor working conditions elsewhere in the country that have led campaigners to describe Romania\u2019s substantial garment sector as \u201cEurope\u2019s cheap sweatshop\u201d. \u201cIn Europe\u2019s low-wage countries, workers rights and human rights at work are publicly a taboo and not protected at all,\u201d said Bettina Musiolek of the Clean Clothes Campaign, which works to improve conditions in the industry. Louis Vuitton\u2019s factories give workers weekends off, pay for overtime and use non-toxic chemicals, the spokeswoman said, facts confirmed by the Inspectoratul Teritorial de Munca, the labour inspectorate in nearby Sibiu. Somarest is a point of pride in this community, the inspectorate made clear. \u201cThere have been no complaints, \u201d said Enciu Dumitru. The factories employ 734 local people who, according to the spokeswoman, are paid average Romanian garment worker wages. According to Clean Clothes Campaign, that is about \u20ac133 (\u00a3116) a month. At that rate it would take a worker nearly six months to earn enough to buy a single pair of mid-priced Louis Vuitton leather court shoes. At such wage rates, garment production in Romania is cheaper than elsewhere in the EU, but lower prices do not mean lower quality, according to Ioana Ciolacu, a leading Romanian fashion designer. \u201cNor should it be mistaken for child labour, sweatshops and all those horror stories we hear now and then happening in let\u2019s say China or Bangladesh,\u201d she said. The products at Somarest are moulded and stitched by hand, just as they are in Louis Vuitton\u2019s advertisements, but the craft is not handed down through generations. Most of the workers are trained on site. Ten years ago the brand opened a store in Bucharest . Shoes produced in Romania can therefore be soled and labeled in France or Italy and then sent back to the Romanian capital to be sold as goods made elsewhere. The start of this process can be seen through the big glass window that overlooks the Somarest factory floor and the hundreds of workers inside.Visitors are closely watched, however, and it was a matter of just a few moments before a senior manager appeared to usher the Guardian away from the glass \u2013 and to direct the spokeswoman into an office for a conversation that appeared terse and stern. The factory visit then came to an abrupt end. \u2022The average wage stated in the original article was from a 2014 report from the Clean Clothes Campaign. Since then the minimum wage has been raised to about \u20ac321.17 gross or \u20ac232 after tax. As the company pays a standard wage for Romanian garment workers, the current wages are therefore likely to reflect that increase.",

The Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) luxury group spent $4.4bn (\u00a33.45bn) last year on marketing its portfolio of top labels, which range from Moet &amp; Chandon champagne to Givenchy, TAG Heuer and Louis Vuitton shoes, adorned with the LV logo that is a global badge of wealth.</p> <p>This is, however, far from the full picture. Many of the shoes and boots it sells for between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,800 a pair and stamped as \u201cmade in Italy\u201d are mostly made in Transylvania, a region better known for vampires than any tradition of luxury craftsmanship. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/may/14/louis-vuitton-cruise-show-japan-mountains-miho-museum\">Louis Vuitton stages flamboyant cruise show in Japanese mountains</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The factories are a well-kept secret, their identity closely guarded.
