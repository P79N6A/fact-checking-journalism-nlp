The economics consultancy Capital Economics, though, said it was sceptical that the situation in the Mediterranean island could be the cause for the sell off in gold</p> <p>The slump continued which meant that the gold had now fallen nearly $200 in the last two days to below $1,400 an ounce for the first time since February 2011. The plunge came as finance ministers and central bank officials travelled to the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting in Washington.</p> <p>Concern may turn to China after a rebound in its economic fortunes late last year appeared to reverse when GDP figures for the first quarter of the year revealed a drop in annualised growth to 7.7% from 7.9% in the previous quarter.</p> <p>Some analysts blamed much of the weakening picture across the globe on the continuing recession in the eurozone, which triggered a 7% decline in imports last month. Most eurozone countries are in recession and growth is not expected to pick up until the end of the year or possibly 2014.</p> <p>In response to the ongoing depression and the possibility that Spain will apply for a bailout, calls for a break-up or fundamental review of the single currency are gathering pace.</p> <p>In Germany, the newly formed political party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland put pressure on the chancellor, Angela Merkel, to restrict eurozone bailout terms unless wealthy property owners in southern Europe make a larger contribution.</p> <p>Peter Bofinger, an economic adviser to Merkel, criticised the bailout terms set for Cyprus, which involved a raid on individual and business savings. \"The resourceful rich just move their money to banks in northern Europe and avoid paying,\" Prof Bofinger told Der Spiegel, a German magazine.</p> <p>He said property owners in Spain, Greece, Portugal and Cyprus should pay a wealth tax to partly fund their government rescue packages.</p> <p>Remarks by Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, that struggling banks should be allowed to fail added to the sense of unease.</p> <p>He said: \"The banking sector and the financial market of the euro area has become fragmented. This is harmful as the euro area is a bank-based economy.</p> <p>\"Around three quarters of firms' financing comes from banks. So if banks in some countries will not lend at reasonable interest rates, the consequences for the euro area economy are severe.\"</p> <p>\"In providing liquidity to our banking counterparties, we cannot and do not want to subsidise banks that are failing.

      "bodyText": "Concerns that strong recoveries in the US and China have come to a dramatic halt sent gold to a two-year low in one of its sharpest falls in recent years. Gold fell 8.5% and silver was down 14.5% as investors digested news from Beijing of a slowdown in growth and a downbeat report from US manufacturers. Brent crude oil prices fell to their lowest since last summer, ending the day only a few cents above $100 a barrel, down 2.3% on the day. Gold had already fallen to its lowest level in 18 months on Friday amid fears that cash-strapped countries would need to sell off their reserves, as Cyprus is expected to do so, to raise \u20ac400m (\u00a3340m) \u2013 although the amount it raises will drop if the price keeps falling. The economics consultancy Capital Economics, though, said it was sceptical that the situation in the Mediterranean island could be the cause for the sell off in gold The slump continued which meant that the gold had now fallen nearly $200 in the last two days to below $1,400 an ounce for the first time since February 2011. The plunge came as finance ministers and central bank officials travelled to the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting in Washington. Concern may turn to China after a rebound in its economic fortunes late last year appeared to reverse when GDP figures for the first quarter of the year revealed a drop in annualised growth to 7.7% from 7.9% in the previous quarter. Some analysts blamed much of the weakening picture across the globe on the continuing recession in the eurozone, which triggered a 7% decline in imports last month. Most eurozone countries are in recession and growth is not expected to pick up until the end of the year or possibly 2014. In response to the ongoing depression and the possibility that Spain will apply for a bailout, calls for a break-up or fundamental review of the single currency are gathering pace. In Germany, the newly formed political party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland put pressure on the chancellor, Angela Merkel, to restrict eurozone bailout terms unless wealthy property owners in southern Europe make a larger contribution. Peter Bofinger, an economic adviser to Merkel, criticised the bailout terms set for Cyprus, which involved a raid on individual and business savings. \"The resourceful rich just move their money to banks in northern Europe and avoid paying,\" Prof Bofinger told Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He said property owners in Spain, Greece, Portugal and Cyprus should pay a wealth tax to partly fund their government rescue packages. Remarks by Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, that struggling banks should be allowed to fail added to the sense of unease. He said: \"The banking sector and the financial market of the euro area has become fragmented. This is harmful as the euro area is a bank-based economy. \"Around three quarters of firms' financing comes from banks. So if banks in some countries will not lend at reasonable interest rates, the consequences for the euro area economy are severe.\" \"In providing liquidity to our banking counterparties, we cannot and do not want to subsidise banks that are failing. Our liquidity support is not and should not be equity support. Likewise, in pricing out break-up risk in sovereign debt securities, we cannot and do not want to subsidise governments,\" he said. Capital Economics said gold has traditionally grown in value during periods of uncertainty. \"None of the fundamental explanations being discussed for the slump in gold prices really holds up. It is still not even certain that Cyprus, whose holdings are tiny, will be selling any gold.

      "bodyText": "Their debut album reached number one in 16 countries, and on their way to chart success the five members of One Direction have provided ample material for gossip columnists. But on Monday Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne attracted attention not for their hairstyles, fashion sense or love lives but because the \u00a35m they each earned last year was described as \"mad\" in a debate on high pay in the City. The business secretary, Vince Cable, was dragged into discussing the wealth of the boy band \u2013 a creation of the X Factor franchise \u2013 after he appeared to agree with remarks by the head of the Institute of Directors, Simon Walker, who is a high-profile critic of City pay. During a debate at which Cable had been highlighting the situation of the low paid on the national minimum wage, Walker attacked the \"greedy sins of those who demand and secure rewards for failure\", and digressed to the pay of pop stars and footballers to put top bosses' salaries into perspective. \"I think it's mad that members of boy band One Direction made \u00a35m each last year,\" Walker said. He made clear that he did not think that the government should intervene or that their pay was any of his business, and said shareholders should clamp down on executive pay. Cable, sitting alongside him, later clarified remarks he had made supporting Walker's general thesis on executive pay, telling Sky News: \"I don't want to attack One Direction, this is one particular group who are apparently very popular and very successful so I have nothing against them. \"But there is a general issue of chief execs in particular who are paid well beyond what can be justified in terms of the performance of their companies, and that's something the government is now trying to address.\" The wealth of the five pop stars \u2013 the oldest of whom is Tomlinson at 21 \u2013 was calculated this weekend for the Sunday Times young music rich list, on which they featured for the first time. Breaking into the US, where two albums made it to number one, helped generate the band's wealth. Walker, who last month attacked \u00a31m payouts to 523 bankers at Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, said: \"When the ordinary, hard-working people who are the workforce, customer base and often shareholders in our companies see value destroyed in scandals like Libor fixing, or the collapse of HBOS, they are shocked. When those who oversaw such disasters get multimillion-pound payoffs rather than public censure, they are horrified and angry, And rightly so.\" Cable has begun investigating whether the three individuals criticised for running HBOS into the ground \u2013 Lord Stevenson, Sir James Crosby, who is handing back his knighthood, and Andy Hornby \u2013 can be struck off as company directors. \"I've got an open mind of whether the system of sanctions is strong enough,\" Cable told the Guardian. He is against a cap on bonuses but at a time when the top rate of tax has been cut to 45% from 50% he admitted he would \"be more radical in taxing wealth\". The business secretary outlined rises in the minimum wage of 1% for those below 21 and by nearly 2%, or 12p an hour, for adults to \u00a36.31. The Resolution Foundation calculated that this constituted a real-terms fall for a fourth year in succession, taking the minimum wage back to the same level as in 2004. Cable acted in line with recommendations by the low pay commission, except with regards to apprenticeships where he raised the hourly rate by 3p to \u00a32.68 despite the independent body's call for the rate to be frozen. The rate for 18- to 20-year-olds will rise by 5p to \u00a35.03, and for 16- and 17-year-olds by 4p to \u00a33.72. Cable said there would be a crackdown on abuses of the minimum wage, pointing to the cash economy of unrecorded wages, restaurateurs making assumptions about tips and other employers making deductions for uniforms. He faced criticism from the public sector Unison for not using a \"living wage\" as the baseline for pay. \"It is a disgrace that 28,000 hard-working local government staff now earn less than the rate which the government accepts is the minimum any worker in the UK should be paid,\" said Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, pointing to council workers who earn \u00a36.30, 1p below the new adult minimum. Cable called for a debate about the living wage campaigns \u2013 in London the rate is set at \u00a38.55 \u2013 which he said needed to be \"grounded in evidence rather than based on rhetoric and political point-scoring\". With debate about high and low pay continuing, investors are under pressure to embark on another \"shareholder spring\" of revolts. Robert Talbut, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, told the conference that remuneration was the responsibility of boards, and called for less complex bonus schemes and less emphasis on \"lottery payouts\".",

When those who oversaw such disasters get multimillion-pound payoffs rather than public censure, they are horrified and angry, And rightly so.\"</p> <p>Cable has begun investigating whether the three individuals criticised for running HBOS into the ground \u2013 Lord Stevenson, Sir James Crosby, who is handing back his knighthood, and Andy Hornby \u2013 can be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/07/vince-cable-seeks-ban-hbos-bosses\" title=\"\">struck off as company directors</a>. \"I've got an open mind of whether the system of sanctions is strong enough,\" Cable told the Guardian.</p> <p>He is against a cap on bonuses but at a time when the top rate of tax has been cut to 45% from 50% he admitted he would \"be more radical in taxing wealth\".</p> <p>The business secretary outlined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/15/minimum-wage-rise\" title=\"\">rises in the minimum wage</a> of 1% for those below 21 and by nearly 2%, or 12p an hour, for adults to \u00a36.31. The Resolution Foundation calculated that this constituted a real-terms fall for a fourth year in succession, taking the minimum wage back to the same level as in 2004.</p> <p>Cable acted in line with recommendations by the low pay commission, except with regards to apprenticeships where he raised the hourly rate by 3p to \u00a32.68 despite the independent body's call for the rate to be frozen. The rate for 18- to 20-year-olds will rise by 5p to \u00a35.03, and for 16- and 17-year-olds by 4p to \u00a33.72.</p> <p>Cable said there would be a crackdown on abuses of the minimum wage, pointing to the cash economy of unrecorded wages, restaurateurs making assumptions about tips and other employers making deductions for uniforms.</p> <p>He faced criticism from the public sector Unison for not using a \"living wage\" as the baseline for pay. \"It is a disgrace that 28,000 hard-working local government staff now earn less than the rate which the government accepts is the minimum any worker in the UK should be paid,\" said Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, pointing to council workers who earn \u00a36.30, 1p below the new adult minimum.</p> <p>Cable called for a debate about the living wage campaigns \u2013 in London the rate is set at \u00a38.55 \u2013 which he said needed to be \"grounded in evidence rather than based on rhetoric and political point-scoring\".</p> <p>With debate about high and low pay continuing, investors are under pressure to embark on another \"shareholder spring\" of revolts. Robert Talbut, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, told the conference that remuneration was the responsibility of boards, and called for less complex bonus schemes and less emphasis on \"lottery payouts\".</p>",

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an airworthiness directive that requires airlines to carry out inspections of components on the 737's tail. The FAA's concerns center on the lack of an anti-corrosive coating on pins used to attach the 737s' horizontal stabiliser \u2013 also known as the tail plane. \"We are issuing this [airworthiness directive] to prevent premature failure of the attach pins, which could cause reduced structural integrity of the horizontal stabiliser to fuselage attachment, resulting in loss of control of the airplane,\" the FAA said. The FAA said the inspection was \"prompted by reports of an incorrect procedure used to apply the wear and corrosion protective surface coating to attach pins of the horizontal stabilizer rear spar.\" In a statement Boeing said the FAA airworthiness directive (AD) had been planned for some time and follows a standard federal process which has been underway over the last year. \"This AD is not linked to any in-service event but rather a finding of a surface finish degradation on recently installed attachment pins. \"The AD requires inspection and possible replacement of the pins by 56,000 flight cycles.

      "standfirst": "Disappointing Chinese data and worries about eurozone gold sales hit mining sector and push leading shares lower", 
      "body": "<p>As gold continued to plummet and disappointing Chinese data added to mining sector woes, at least airline shares were flying high.</p> <p><strong>Easyjet</strong> climbed 35p to \u00a311.38 and <strong>International Airlines Group</strong>, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, finished 6.8p better at 250.4p.</p> <p>Analysts have been concerned about overcapacity in the sector but there now seem to be signs that airlines are becoming more disciplined in their attitude. Nomura analysts said:</p> <blockquote> While air travel volumes have grown 9% compound in the post war period, global margins have been just 2%, as the benefits of increased aircraft efficiency and higher load factors have accrued to customers through cheaper real ticket prices, governments and airport operators, aircraft manufacturers and generous compensation for their unionised workforces. <br> One key reason for weak returns and falling real ticket prices is the nature of, and approach, to airline capacity. Airline capacity has been fragmented and the mindset of the airlines has been one of growth over achieving appropriate returns.  Recent signals that the airlines are taking a more disciplined approach to capacity discipline gives some hopes that the spell of bad airline industry returns can be broken.  We continue to have a preference for IAG and Lufthansa over Air France-KLM among the networks and easyjet within the low cost carriers. </blockquote> <p>But the rise in airline shares and a smattering of bid talk was not enough to prevent markets moving lower, as mining shares took the brunt of the selloff.</p> <p>Copper hit a one and a half year low following news that China had reported <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/15/china-economic-growth-gdp-slows-q1\" title=\"\">a 7.7% rise in first quarter GDP</a>, lower than the 7.9% growth achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012 and below forecasts of 8%.</p> <p>But gold was under pressure again, partly on worries that troubled eurozone countries could flood the market by selling reserves to boost their struggling finances.</p> <p>So <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> was down 413p at \u00a345.45, not helped by Citigroup cutting its price target from \u00a355.40 to \u00a343 and issuing a sell recommendation. <strong>Fresnillo</strong> fell 193p to \u00a310.80, while among the mid-caps, <strong>Petropavlovsk</strong> slumped 44.8p to 141.8p and Egyptian gold miner Centamin closed 5.17p lower at 37.83p.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Polymetal</strong> lost 113p to 746p as Citi cut from neutral to sell and slashed its target from \u00a311.31 to 577p and <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> dropped 11.3p to 238.1p, with JP Morgan Cazenove edging down its price target to 295p from 300p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell 40.79 points to 6343.60 having dropped as low as 6300, despite takeover speculation lifting water shares. <strong>United Utilities</strong> jumped 18p to 739p following weekend reports the company was beefing up its defences against a bid. Infrastructure funds are said to be keen on UK utilities, which has also helped lift <strong>Severn Trent</strong> 27p to \u00a317.33.</p> <p>Still with utilities, <strong>Centrica</strong> climbed 2.3p to 381.7p after the British Gas owner linked up with Qatar Petroleum to pay \u00a3650m for oil and gas assets in Canada. Deutsche Bank kept its hold recommendation:</p> <blockquote> This [deal] is consistent with its updated strategy, focusing on gas rather than power assets upstream, and on North America. Centrica's 60% share of the deal will increase the group's upstream production by about 12%. While we are unexcited by the new strategy, the acquisition should not be a shock to investors. </blockquote> <p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> was the biggest riser in the leading index, gaining 61p to 1630.5p on hopes of US approval for Breo, its experimental lung disease treatment developed with Theravance.</p> <p>Reviewers from the US Food and Drug Administration said data appeared inconsistent but Breo's safety profile was consistent with similar drugs. An expert meeting is due to be held on Wednesday, and Jeffrey Holford at Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> The probability of approval increases marginally, but [Wednesday's meeting] will be key We expect peak sales of $1.5bn for Breo/Relvar. On the back of these documents we are marginally more comfortable with the approvability of Breo for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the US, and now expect a 50% probability of a complete response letter [letting the companies know an application is not ready for approval], down from a 60% probability of a CRL prior to the documents release. </blockquote> <p>In the betting world, <strong>Betfair</strong> soared 82.5p to 782p on news it was facing a possible \u00a3800m bid but <strong>Ladbrokes</strong> lost 16.6p to 190.3p after warning on profits, partly due to paying out on favourites at the recent Cheltenham festival.</p> <p>Private equity firm CVC Capital said was considering an offer for Betfair and had held preliminary talks with possible partners including investor Richard Koch, who holds 6.5% of Betfair. But it said there was no guarantee an offer would be made, and the betting exchange advised its shareholders to take no action. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt issued a hold recommendation on Betfair shares, saying:</p> <blockquote> The interest from CVC looks like good opportunistic timing but whether a full bid will materialise is difficult to say at this stage. However, it could well provide a catalyst for either others to look at Betfair or lead management to take a different strategic route [such as acquisitions or mergers]. Either of these outcomes should be positive for shareholders. <br> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Ladbrokes warned in an unscheduled update that annual profits would be at the bottom end of forecasts.

      "bodyText": "As gold continued to plummet and disappointing Chinese data added to mining sector woes, at least airline shares were flying high. Easyjet climbed 35p to \u00a311.38 and International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, finished 6.8p better at 250.4p. Analysts have been concerned about overcapacity in the sector but there now seem to be signs that airlines are becoming more disciplined in their attitude. Nomura analysts said: While air travel volumes have grown 9% compound in the post war period, global margins have been just 2%, as the benefits of increased aircraft efficiency and higher load factors have accrued to customers through cheaper real ticket prices, governments and airport operators, aircraft manufacturers and generous compensation for their unionised workforces. One key reason for weak returns and falling real ticket prices is the nature of, and approach, to airline capacity. Airline capacity has been fragmented and the mindset of the airlines has been one of growth over achieving appropriate returns. Recent signals that the airlines are taking a more disciplined approach to capacity discipline gives some hopes that the spell of bad airline industry returns can be broken. We continue to have a preference for IAG and Lufthansa over Air France-KLM among the networks and easyjet within the low cost carriers. But the rise in airline shares and a smattering of bid talk was not enough to prevent markets moving lower, as mining shares took the brunt of the selloff. Copper hit a one and a half year low following news that China had reported a 7.7% rise in first quarter GDP, lower than the 7.9% growth achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012 and below forecasts of 8%. But gold was under pressure again, partly on worries that troubled eurozone countries could flood the market by selling reserves to boost their struggling finances. So Randgold Resources was down 413p at \u00a345.45, not helped by Citigroup cutting its price target from \u00a355.40 to \u00a343 and issuing a sell recommendation. Fresnillo fell 193p to \u00a310.80, while among the mid-caps, Petropavlovsk slumped 44.8p to 141.8p and Egyptian gold miner Centamin closed 5.17p lower at 37.83p. Elsewhere Polymetal lost 113p to 746p as Citi cut from neutral to sell and slashed its target from \u00a311.31 to 577p and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation dropped 11.3p to 238.1p, with JP Morgan Cazenove edging down its price target to 295p from 300p. Overall the FTSE 100 fell 40.79 points to 6343.60 having dropped as low as 6300, despite takeover speculation lifting water shares. United Utilities jumped 18p to 739p following weekend reports the company was beefing up its defences against a bid. Infrastructure funds are said to be keen on UK utilities, which has also helped lift Severn Trent 27p to \u00a317.33. Still with utilities, Centrica climbed 2.3p to 381.7p after the British Gas owner linked up with Qatar Petroleum to pay \u00a3650m for oil and gas assets in Canada. Deutsche Bank kept its hold recommendation: This [deal] is consistent with its updated strategy, focusing on gas rather than power assets upstream, and on North America. Centrica's 60% share of the deal will increase the group's upstream production by about 12%. While we are unexcited by the new strategy, the acquisition should not be a shock to investors. GlaxoSmithKline was the biggest riser in the leading index, gaining 61p to 1630.5p on hopes of US approval for Breo, its experimental lung disease treatment developed with Theravance. Reviewers from the US Food and Drug Administration said data appeared inconsistent but Breo's safety profile was consistent with similar drugs. An expert meeting is due to be held on Wednesday, and Jeffrey Holford at Jefferies said: The probability of approval increases marginally, but [Wednesday's meeting] will be key We expect peak sales of $1.5bn for Breo/Relvar. On the back of these documents we are marginally more comfortable with the approvability of Breo for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the US, and now expect a 50% probability of a complete response letter [letting the companies know an application is not ready for approval], down from a 60% probability of a CRL prior to the documents release. In the betting world, Betfair soared 82.5p to 782p on news it was facing a possible \u00a3800m bid but Ladbrokes lost 16.6p to 190.3p after warning on profits, partly due to paying out on favourites at the recent Cheltenham festival. Private equity firm CVC Capital said was considering an offer for Betfair and had held preliminary talks with possible partners including investor Richard Koch, who holds 6.5% of Betfair. But it said there was no guarantee an offer would be made, and the betting exchange advised its shareholders to take no action. Nick Batram at Peel Hunt issued a hold recommendation on Betfair shares, saying: The interest from CVC looks like good opportunistic timing but whether a full bid will materialise is difficult to say at this stage. However, it could well provide a catalyst for either others to look at Betfair or lead management to take a different strategic route [such as acquisitions or mergers]. Either of these outcomes should be positive for shareholders. Meanwhile Ladbrokes warned in an unscheduled update that annual profits would be at the bottom end of forecasts. That indicates a total of around \u00a3188m compared to \u00a3206m last year, dashing hopes the company was over the worst after problems with its online business. It said first quarter operating profits fell \u00a313m to \u00a337.4m. It made \u00a36m less revenue from Cheltenham and saw a \u00a39m increase in like for like costs and machine taxation. Ocado slid 9.2p to 141p after Barclays analysts issued a downbeat note on the online grocer but Dixons Retail rose 0.82p to 35.4p following a positive note from Panmure Gordon. Analyst Philip Dorgan said: In the light of a strong share price performance, we have re-examined our forecasts and our valuation of Dixons.

We therefore retain our buy recommendation.",

After a whimsical journey through Amsterdam's history and the crisis of 1763, he gave a stark warning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In providing liquidity to our banking counterparties, we cannot and do not want to subsidise banks that are failing. Our liquidity support is not and should not be equity support. Likewise, in pricing out break-up risk in sovereign debt securities, we cannot and do not want to subsidise governments.</p> </blockquote> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unlike economies with a single fiscal authority or with a fully-fledged federal structure, the euro area comprises multiple sovereign states. The debt of each of these states has different liquidity and risk characteristics. In such a set-up there is no uncontroversial way to define the term structure of the risk-free rate. As a matter of fact, this means that there is no univocal measure of the term premium for the euro area as a whole.</p> <p>The banking sector and the financial market of the euro area has become fragmented. This is harmful as the euro area is a bank-based economy. Around three quarters of firms\u2019 financing comes from banks. So if banks in some countries will not lend at reasonable interest rates, the consequences for the euro area economy are severe.</p> </blockquote> <p>And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-04-15T14:10:24.395Z\">at 3.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-516bff15e4b046e93b9623dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-15T13:23:46.843Z\">2.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More from Draghi's Amsterdam speech.</p> <p>He says financial sector fragmentation in the eurozone has been receding but problems in the euro area's economic landscape still \"loom large\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b6010132-4161-4972-bc45-922fccc59679\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/15/1366032133504/f0244bff-385d-49e5-9fa8-d0a5f29ad3d8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mario Draghi met De Nederlandsche Bank President Klaas Knot (2nd L), Dutch PM Mark Rutte (centre L) and Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem (2nd R) in The Hague today.

That\u2019s actually only a sensible thing to do in pretty extreme circumstances. Gold returns are utterly crushed by equity markets in the long term \u2013 to a really astonishing degree <em>for those economies where we have continuous equity markets</em>. Compared with shares in pre-revolutionary China or pre-war Poland, gold returns look pretty good. Gold is less an index of how confident we are that our leaders a) want to b) know how to do the right thing as it is an index of how sure we are that they won\u2019t completely and utterly screw the pooch.</p> <p>So what can go wrong?</p> <p>I\u2019m sick of hearing about hyperinflation. The case for gold often starts off with a chart of narrow money or the Central Bank balance sheet, and skips over the (dead-in-the-water) dynamics of broad money. Economists like to use the parable of \u201chelicopter money\u201d (banknotes thrown from a helicopter), and sadly some people appear to be scanning the skies for scrip-dispensing helicopters. What\u2019s actually happened is that the helicopter pilot suffered some nasty losses on US subprime debt and Greek Government bonds and is hoarding the new money, so it\u2019s not having a lot of inflationary impact.</p> <p>If inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, hyperinflation is a political one. Without the political conditions \u2013 usually an-even-more-than-normally unpopular and illegitimate government \u2013 usually the harder choices do in fact get taken. Argentina and Russia (and Jamaica for that matter) defaulted on debt in local currency debt that they could print rather than face hyperinflationary consequences. Argentina and Iceland both imposed capital controls for similar reasons.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-516bc29ee4b046e93b9623bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-15T09:04:30.124Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/M_McDonough/status/323722692853387264\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>*GOLD FUTURES FALL $100 AN OUNCE TO $1,401 IN NEW YORK TRADING -Bloomberg</p>&mdash; Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/M_McDonough/status/323722692853387264\">April 15, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/katie_martin_FX/status/323722164249448448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Slip sliding away. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23goldsongs\">#goldsongs</a></p>&mdash; Katie Martin (@katie_martin_FX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katie_martin_FX/status/323722164249448448\">April 15, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/323722096473669633\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Gold going down like a knackered lift</p>&mdash; World First (@World_First) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/323722096473669633\">April 15, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-516bc1cbe4b00f501f7c42de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-15T09:01:00.017Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Gold reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So what has caused gold to fall 3% today, after a 5.3% fall on Friday?</p> <p>Hitting a two-year low, gold, along with other commodities, have slumped.</p> <p>Usually gold is invested in to hedge against inflation.

      "bodyText": "With gold on the slide again - thanks to disappointing Chinese growth and fears of countries flooding the market by selling their reserves to boost their finances - stock markets were also under pressure. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Anyone hoping for a quiet start to the week in the lead up to this week\u2019s G20 and IMF meetings got a rude awakening as European markets dropped sharply on the open in the wake of disappointing Chinese economic data which showed that economic growth for the first quarter only came in at 7.7%, well below expectations of a rise to 8%. Mining stocks and commodity prices have got absolutely battered with gold prices falling though a key technical support level and silver prices also doing the same thing. But by the close, many European markets had come off their worst levels: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished down 40.79 points at 6343.60, a 0.64% fall \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 0.41% \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.5% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB lost 0.96% \u2022 Spain's Ibex fell 0.33% \u2022 The Athens market dipped 0.11% And with downbeat US manufacturing and housing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 120 points. On that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. Recently appointed Cypriot finance minister Haris Georgiades insists there is no anti-EU feeling in the country despite criticisms of the bailout terms. In an interview with the Financial Times he said there was frustration at the remedy offered, but also a realisation that the problems were self-inflicted rather than coming from outsiders. Portuguese banks may not need extra capital despite what a leading ratings agency suggested, according to the head of the country's Banking Association. Moody's warned last week the country's banks might need an extra \u20ac8bn as non-performing loans had risen more than expected. But Fernando Faria de Oliveira told Reuters that \"nothing points to those figures\" and at the moment there was no need for more capital. He said: I respect Moody's but I don't believe we will need to raise such [an] amount of capital at all. We are confident about the solidity of Portuguese banks. The latest US data has added to the gloom engendered by disappointing Chinese growth figures and the continuing pressure on the gold price. Following worst than expected New York manufacturing figures comes a downbeat US housing survey. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index fell to 42 in April from 44 in March, the third dip in a row. Analysts had been expecting a small rise to 45. Builders reported increasing costs of materials and worries about the supply chain. With that, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added to opening losses and is now down nearly 100 points or around 0.7%. More from Draghi: There is not much new in Draghi's comments, according to Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy: In a nutshell, Draghi hasn't added much to what suggested in early April. The ECB is widely aware with problems with SMEs but it looks like it has no \"magic wand\" to solve the lack of transmission. Comments by Draghi suggest that some step in the direction of repairing SMEs lack of competitiveness have been made but it's not just the ECB policy that can work its way through the economy. The European Central Bank has published a full copy of President Mario Draghi's speech. After a whimsical journey through Amsterdam's history and the crisis of 1763, he gave a stark warning: In providing liquidity to our banking counterparties, we cannot and do not want to subsidise banks that are failing. Our liquidity support is not and should not be equity support. Likewise, in pricing out break-up risk in sovereign debt securities, we cannot and do not want to subsidise governments. He added: Unlike economies with a single fiscal authority or with a fully-fledged federal structure, the euro area comprises multiple sovereign states. The debt of each of these states has different liquidity and risk characteristics. In such a set-up there is no uncontroversial way to define the term structure of the risk-free rate. As a matter of fact, this means that there is no univocal measure of the term premium for the euro area as a whole. The banking sector and the financial market of the euro area has become fragmented. This is harmful as the euro area is a bank-based economy. Around three quarters of firms\u2019 financing comes from banks. So if banks in some countries will not lend at reasonable interest rates, the consequences for the euro area economy are severe. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. More from Draghi's Amsterdam speech. He says financial sector fragmentation in the eurozone has been receding but problems in the euro area's economic landscape still \"loom large\". Over at the University of Amsterdam, ECB president, Mario Draghi, is giving a speech. He said: We do not want to support banks that are failing Suggesting he has moved away from his position of unlimited funding to bolster struggling markets. Here are tweets coming from the room EU officials are expected to tell the G20 finance ministers in Washington this week: The euro area has made further progress in the implementation of its comprehensive crisis-response strategy. With a mild recovery setting in toward mid-2013 and strengthening in the second half of 2013 and in 2014. That's according to Bloomberg who have seen a draft statement left over from a similar meeting in Dublin last Friday. The pace of growth in manufacturing in New York state - an early indicator for the rest of the country - slowed more than expected. The New York Federal Reserve's \"Empire State\" general business conditions index fell to 3.05, from 9.24 in Larch, short of forecasts of 7. New orders dropped to 2.2 from 8.18, inventories improved to -4.55 from -5.68. The Telegraph has reported comments from Professor Peter Bofinger, an adviser to Angela Merkel, that he made in Der Spiegel. In it, he suggests the rich in struggling eurozone countries, such as Spain and Italy, should face new property taxes instead of any future raids on depositors savings, as in Cyprus. He told the German magazine: The resourceful rich just move their money to banks in northern Europe and avoid paying. Instead of taxing cash, European Union governments should in future target property and other, less mobile assets, he said. For example, over the next 10 years, the rich should give up a portion of their assets. The argument goes that the taxes should be used to fund future bailouts rather than relying on cash injections from the Troika. However, Merkel has yet to endorse the ideas put forward by Bofinger. The eurozone's trade surplus grew in February, but the positive balance was helped by lower demand for imports rather than export growth. The trade surplus with \u20ac10.4bn in February, unadjusted, beating expectations of \u20ac3bn, and up from a \u20ac1.3bn surplus in February last year. Eurozone exports were down 1.1% year-on-year in February, while imports were down by 7.1% year-on-year. Seasonally-adjusted data show the trade surplus improved to \u20ac12bn in February, after dipping to \u20ac8.7bn in January from \u20ac10bn in December. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The eurozone is likely to have needed all the help it could get from net trade in the first quarter of 2013 as it looks highly likely that domestic demand contracted overall. The eurozone will be fervently hoping that global growth improves as 2013 proceeds, thereby boosting exports and facilitating the single currency area\u2019s exit from recession. A new major study in Greece has found that heart attacks have increased during the economic crisis, giving an insight into the effects beyond monetary ones. Open Democracy, which reports the findings, said heart attacks increased 29% after the crisis hit, compared with before, with women suffering hardest hit - up 39%. The researchers point out the unemployment rate for women is higher than men Dr Emannouil Makaris, presenting his findings at a research talk at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s annual meeting, said Greek women have a higher unemployment rate than men, they are responsible for child care, and they also work outside the home - a formula for stress. Unemployment is a stressful event and stress is connected with heart disease, but other issues also come with financial difficulties. In these times a lot of people do not have money to buy medications or go to their primary care doctor. The cost to society is high. Sticking with gold, Pawelmorski has written an excellent blog post on the precious metal. Here's an extract: Gold \u2013 unlike bank deposits, equity or bonds, or even banknotes \u2013 it\u2019s separate from the real economy; it\u2019s what you invest in when you want to take a breather from what\u2019s happening in the real economy. That\u2019s actually only a sensible thing to do in pretty extreme circumstances. Gold returns are utterly crushed by equity markets in the long term \u2013 to a really astonishing degree for those economies where we have continuous equity markets. Compared with shares in pre-revolutionary China or pre-war Poland, gold returns look pretty good. Gold is less an index of how confident we are that our leaders a) want to b) know how to do the right thing as it is an index of how sure we are that they won\u2019t completely and utterly screw the pooch. So what can go wrong? I\u2019m sick of hearing about hyperinflation. The case for gold often starts off with a chart of narrow money or the Central Bank balance sheet, and skips over the (dead-in-the-water) dynamics of broad money. Economists like to use the parable of \u201chelicopter money\u201d (banknotes thrown from a helicopter), and sadly some people appear to be scanning the skies for scrip-dispensing helicopters. What\u2019s actually happened is that the helicopter pilot suffered some nasty losses on US subprime debt and Greek Government bonds and is hoarding the new money, so it\u2019s not having a lot of inflationary impact. If inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, hyperinflation is a political one. Without the political conditions \u2013 usually an-even-more-than-normally unpopular and illegitimate government \u2013 usually the harder choices do in fact get taken. Argentina and Russia (and Jamaica for that matter) defaulted on debt in local currency debt that they could print rather than face hyperinflationary consequences. Argentina and Iceland both imposed capital controls for similar reasons. So what has caused gold to fall 3% today, after a 5.3% fall on Friday? Hitting a two-year low, gold, along with other commodities, have slumped. Usually gold is invested in to hedge against inflation. Some bearish analysts have warning the past that it would be a good bet because of the fears of hyperinflation. However, these haven't panned out. Michael van Dulken at Accendo Markets said: Gold took another leg down from its Friday weakness, although off its worst levels of $1425 (2-year lows). Having decisively broken 18-month lows of $1520 on Friday, this level could well revert to resistance on any rally attempt. Broker bearishness (optimistic on economic growth), uncertainty over duration of US Fed\u2019s QE3 (again optimism on econ growth), ETF outflows and fears of Eurozone nations selling the metal to pay for bailouts all spooking markets. A reminder \u2013 Cyprus said on Friday it would try and sell \u20ac400m-worth of its gold, leading to fears that other countries could turn to a gold selloff to fund its needs. As RANSquawk points out, poor GDP numbers from China will temper inflation (as well as knock other commodity prices). While, bad retail figures from the US last week, and a more determined effort by the eurozone to keep an eye on inflation means the need to hedge with gold looks less important by the day. Joe Weisenthal wrote over at Business Insider: So the collapse in gold is not about gold, but about vindication for a large corpus of belief and economic research, which has largely panned out. It's great that our economic elites know what they're talking about, and have the tools at their disposal to address crises without creating some new catastrophe. Things aren't great in the economy, but the collapse/hyperinflation fears haven't panned out, and the decline in gold is a manifestation of that. The Troika group of lenders \u2013 the European Commission, ECB and IMF \u2013 have put out a statement on the agreement reached with Greece this morning. You can read the statement in its entirety here, but in short, it's very much steady-as-she-goes missive. The mission and the authorities agreed that the economic outlook is largely unchanged from the previous review, with continued prospects for a gradual return to growth in 2014, supported by inflation well below the euro area average and improved wage flexibility, which are helping to restore the competitiveness of the Greek economy. It says debt reduction has been achieved, more autonomy has been given to tax collectors, tax evasion and corruption has been tackled. It added: The mission also discussed with the authorities progress in strengthening the social safety net, including through targeted employment and training programmes supported by the EU, pilot programmes to extend unemployment benefits and provide minimum income support, a programme to provide access to primary health care for the uninsured, and a scheme to reduce the financial burden on indebted low-income households which have been severely affected by the crisis. Over in Athens, the Greek government has been meeting with the Troika group of lenders. Finance minister Yiannis Stournaras told waiting reporters that a deal has been reacted on a review of the country's austerity programme, adding that the Cyprus crisis will not change Greece's macro-economic situation. Finally, he revealed the cuts have seen a primary budget surplus this year, which will be used to pay down public debt. Spot gold prices continue to fall, hitting $1,450 an ounce, the lowest level in two years. Bang on time, the FTSE 100's biggest fallers on opening are all mining companies, reacting to the Chinese data and commodity price falls. Randgold (down -4.9%), Fresnillo (down 3.8%), Polymetal (down 3.2%), Evraz (down 3.2%), Rio Tinito (down 3%), ENRC (down 2.1%), Anglo American (down 1.9%), Antofagasta (down 1.9%), BHP Billiton (down 1.6%) and Xstrata (down 1.6%) Good morning and welcome to another day of rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. After the excitement of Friday's finance ministers get-together in Dublin and Cameron and Merkel's weekend together, today is slightly quieter, but we wait to see if the tumbles in commodities continue. Gold fell to an 18-month low, with oil and silver both down too. Overnight, disappointing numbers came out of China, with Q1 GDP at 7.7% missing expectations of 8% and down from 7.9% last time. Industrial production in March fell from 9.9% to 8.9%, missing expectations of 10.1%. However, retail sales remained strong at 12.4%, up from 12.3% in February. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, results of the country's general election are through, but political uncertainly in the oil-rich country could also have an impact on commodities. We will be keeping an eye on all the reaction to the results and any other events to break throughout the day.",

But perhaps the wrong intoxicant was being blamed. The controversial former drug tsar David Nutt told the Sunday Times this weekend that cocaine-using bankers with their \"culture of excitement and drive and more and more and more ... got us into this terrible mess\". I'm inclined to agree. Cocaine is (I'm reliably informed) a drug that results in intense bouts of over-exuberance as well as a tendency to talk extremely convincingly about stuff you know nothing about. Everyone accepts that a credit bubble occurred in the mid-noughties and that it was a direct result of what the former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan has referred to as \"irrational exuberance\". It could also be argued that traders would be better able to sell absurdly complicated financial weapons of mass destruction after taking a confidence-boosting narcotic such as cocaine. Furthermore, surely only cocaine-ravaged buffoons would actually buy billions of dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities when they were so clearly doomed to explode the minute the property boom stalled. I certainly saw my fair share of sniffly noses and gurning jaws at City bars every Thursday night.

Dr Chris Luke, an A&amp;E specialist based at Cork University Hospital, Ireland, who has studied the effects of cocaine on bankers, has stated that \"prominent figures in financial and political circles made irrational decisions as a result of megalomania brought on by cocaine usage\". He concludes that \"people were making insane decisions and thinking they were 110% right \u2026 which led to the current chaos.\" Greed, selfishness, ignorance and ruthlessness also played their part, of course, but I think it would be foolish not to see the role that the drug played in creating the bubble. Herd mentality, which thrives during times of uncertainty, is certainly much more explicable when you factor in the trembling insecurity and depleted discernment that go hand in hand with a coke habit. There is, I'm pleased to say, a happy ending to this sorry tale: my ex-colleagues and clients who still work in the Square Mile tell me that many City boys are now too scared to keep snorting the Bolivian marching powder.

That indicates a total of around \u00a3188m compared to \u00a3206m last year, dashing hopes the company was over the worst after problems with its online business. It said first quarter operating profits fell \u00a313m to \u00a337.4m. It made \u00a36m less revenue from Cheltenham and saw a \u00a39m increase in like for like costs and machine taxation. Greg Johnson at Shore Capital said: Overall, we see the statement as odd given bookies success at the Grand National and continued volatile football results. With retail trading flat at best and limited momentum online, Ladbrokes appears much more at the risk of sporting results than its closest peer William Hill, which continues to demonstrate significant customer momentum, especially with online accounting for half of group profits. We would see fair value down to 170p-180p per share which would assume little for a recovery in the online operation.",
