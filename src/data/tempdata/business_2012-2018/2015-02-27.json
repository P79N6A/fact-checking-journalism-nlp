      "bodyText": "Profits at International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, have soared past \u20ac1bn (\u00a3730m) after tax and the company has promised even more for 2015 with a sharp upgrade to its forecast. The post-tax profits and \u20ac1.4bn operating profit are vindication of the chief executive\u2019s view that the merger of British Airways and Iberia would eventually pay off, after three years in which IAG was dragged nearer or into the red by heavy losses at the Spanish airline. Chief executive Willie Walsh had promised that Iberia would break even in 2014 after a restructuring that included thousands of redundancies, and now the airline has made \u20ac50m in operating profit. British Airways\u2019 lucrative transatlantic routes and lower costs across the group underpinned the profits but Walsh said Iberia\u2019s contribution was key to the improvement. He said: \u201cIberia\u2019s turnaround has been remarkable, both financially and operationally, and we\u2019re very proud of its achievement especially its strong cost discipline. \u201cIn 2013, we said our intention was for Iberia to break even in 2014 and it has fulfilled that promise.\u201d He added that Iberia remained a work in progress but it would match the profit margins of BA in the medium term. IAG, which also includes Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling, said operating profit across the group would probably come in above \u20ac2.2bn for 2015. That is more than 20% higher than its previous guidance, helped by the global oil price slump that is driving down fuel costs for airlines, as well as increased capacity. Walsh said that although lower oil prices did help to bring down costs last year, other factors such as more fuel-efficient aircraft were also responsible. \u201cWe achieved a strong unit cost performance \u2013 down 4.1% \u2013 through increased productivity, supplier cost savings and lower fuel unit costs. The latter was boosted by the introduction of more efficient aircraft into our fleet and lower fuel prices in the last quarter of the year. However, the positive effect of the oil price reduction has been partly offset by hedging and significant currency impact.\u201d Despite the profits, Walsh ruled out any announcements on cutting fuel surcharges for passengers, although he said the charges were kept under review. Shares closed at 580p, up by 3.6%. Operating profit jumped 80% in the year to 31 December 2014, from \u20ac770m in 2013. Revenue rose 8% to \u20ac20.2bn (\u00a314.5bn). Walsh said IAG would continue to pursue its acquisition of the Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, but he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to walk away from a deal that would mean far more to Aer Lingus than IAG. Its \u20ac1.36bn bid has yet to receive the support of the Irish government, which owns a 25% stake. Earlier this week, Dublin presented IAG with a new list of demands in return for backing a deal, including assurances on jobs and on connections between Ireland and London. Walsh said he would be waiting another week before flying to Dublin next week to speak to unions and government officials. \u201cWe will sit down with the so-called expert panel that has been appointed by the minister of transport. \u201cFor IAG, it\u2019s not a must-do at all \u2013 it\u2019s a nice deal, an attractive deal, one we like but we will only do it on terms that are acceptable to us and if they\u2019re not we\u2019ll have no hesitation in recommending to the board of IAG that we don\u2019t proceed. For Aer Lingus it\u2019s a much bigger deal \u2013 they\u2019ve said that their ability to grow is significantly enhanced by being part of IAG.\u201d Despite recent pledges by George Osborne and the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, to move swiftly on expanding Heathrow or Gatwick, Walsh said he remained pessimistic. \u201cYou need political consensus. I think it\u2019s highly unlikely we\u2019ll have anything other than a coalition so the politics will be the overriding factor. I expect the airports commission will produce an excellent report but I don\u2019t see any evidence of political consensus and I don\u2019t believe there will be action on the back of it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here are some photos from tonight\u2019s anti-government demonstration in Athens. Despite the bad weather, the KKE communist party did manage to rally the troops. It\u2019s a reminder to Alexis Tsipras that he could face larger protests if the public feel let down by his government. As Helena puts it from Athens: The demo tonight is a warning shot over the bows of the government that there will be mass protests if it goes too far. And that, I think, is all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting - it\u2019s been a busy few days. Next week probably won\u2019t be any different. Good night! GW And before the cameras in the cabinet room are switched off, Alexis Tsipras declares: \u201cThe country has come out of this difficult and hard process of real negotiation stronger and more proud.\u201d Alexis Tsipras may be offering Greece some sugar, before the yuckier medicine prescribed by its creditors. As our own Helena Smith tweets: Tsipras has also promised an investigation into how Greece was forced into its bailouts. Although the question is, how far back to you go?.... Alexis Tsipras has allowed the TV cameras into the cabinet room in Athens tonight, as he outlines his government\u2019s plans. He\u2019s pledging to bring legislation to parliament next week to enact some of the reforms announced this week. Thanks to the magic of Twitter, here are the key points from the invaluable Diane Shugart: Outside parliament, Greece\u2019s communists are valiantly pressing on with their demonstration despite the inclement weather. No point getting soggy, though: Alexis Tsipras is holding a cabinet meeting tonight to discuss the government\u2019s next move: Despite the rain, demonstrators are now massing outside the Greek parliament: The chants of KKE communist party protesters are wafting through central Athens, reports Helena Smith, as they march through the city centre on their way up Syntagma square where tonight\u2019s \u201canti-loan\u201d rally is due to take place. It has been raining hard in the Greek capital and only the hardiest are expected to attend the demonstration called to denounce the leftist-led government\u2019s climbdown in Brussels last week. A statement by Greece\u2019s celebrated composer Mikis Theodorakis denouncing the loan accord was to be read out at the rally. Theodorakis met with Alexis Tsipras earlier this week; clearly he\u2019s not placated.... Investors are still pricing in a high chance that Greece\u2019s debts will be \u2018restructured\u2019: The Greek media has been rather taken by what some are describing as the liveliest display of support yet for the crisis plagued country abroad, reports Helena Smith in Athens. Three bare-chested women - former activists of the Femen group - have caused a bit of commotion outside the Berlin offices of Bild protesting against the mass-selling tabloid\u2019s \u201cno to greedy Greeks\u201d campaign launched earlier this week. The semi-naked protestors had written Ja (Yes) and \u201cFree Greece\u201d in blue paint across their bodies. They then went on to dance the famous Greek Syrtaki while throwing back copious amounts of ouzo. \u201cWe wanted to show another face. Not just to German citizens but to the Greek people,\u201d one was quoted as saying. Ta Nea has more details. Bild, it appears, maybe rowing back after a wave of criticism - including in the Bundestag this morning. Meanwhile in Athens, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras has been meeting with one of the new wave of European politicians, German Green MEP Ska Keller. Greece is being deliberately starved of liquidity in an effort to get its reform plans motoring, according to Reuters this afternoon. Even though the Bundestag has approved the extension, Greece has little hope of getting any funding until it has satisfied its creditors, they say, quoting Brussels sources. Here\u2019s a flavour: Shut out of debt markets and faced with a steep fall in tax revenues, Athens is expected to run out of cash by the middle or end of March. Its finance minister has warned that Greece will struggle to repay creditors starting with a 1.5bn euro IMF loan repayment due in March. Athens has been looking for quick fixes to tide it through the coming weeks but has not found one yet. Euro zone officials hope the liquidity squeeze will force Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s nascent government to agree reform plans more quickly than the end of April deadline set by creditors, paving the way for bailout funding to be released. \u201cThe liquidity squeeze is being used to push the Greeks to very quickly start discussions on the review and finish that as soon as possible \u2013 not even waiting for the end of April,\u201d one euro zone official said. Greece hopes to clear this funding crisis by being allowed to issue more short-term debt; but only if the ECB allows it... In the US, revised figures showed GDP rose at an annualised rate of 2.2% (revised from 2.6%) in the fourth quarter, down sharply from 5% in the previous quarter. However economists were expecting a slowdown to 2.1%. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: The slowdown is unlikely to worry Fed policymakers, however, who are likely to \u2018keep calm and carry on\u2019 with contemplating an initial rate hike in the summer, possibly as early as June. One reason for the lack of concern is that the slowdown was due in part to a far smaller than previously estimated inventory build-up, in turn thought to be partly due to port strikes. The weaker stock build-up late last year bodes well for first quarter growth. There was also better news on investment, with business spending on equipment rising at a 0.9% annualised rate instead of falling 1.9%, as initially thought. Consumer spending growth meanwhile remained solid, revised down only marginally to still rise at an annualised rate of 4.2%, its fastest since the start of 2006. In a closely watched auction, Greece plans to sell \u20ac875m of six-month treasury bills next Wednesday to refinance a maturing issue. Greek banks use T-bills as collateral to borrow from the ECB\u2019s emergency liquidity line and then invest the money in more T-bills. This helps the government, which is frozen out of the bond markets, to cover its short-term needs. Foreign investors have shied away from T-bill sales in recent months. They are the only source of commercial borrowing for Tsipras\u2019 government. Over in Athens, government sources are saying that prime minister Alexis Tsipras will unveil five pieces of legislation to be brought before parliament next week when his cabinet meets at 7:30pm tonight. Helena Smith reports that the bills will: call for the establishment of an investigative committee into the circumstances surrounding Greece\u2019s request to be bailed out from the EU, ECB and IMF outline how the leftist-led coalition will crack down on tax evasion outline how unpaid tax dues can be settled with a repayment process of up to 100 installments legislate against foreclosures including primary homes of indebted Greeks legislate the reinstatement of the state-run television channel dismantled by the previous coalition government As reported earlier, Tsipras will make a televised address to the nation at the start of the cabinet session which will otherwise be closed. Despite dissent within the ranks of his radical left Syriza party, the young prime minister is enjoying unprecedented levels of popularity, according to polls. So far, the EFSF has handed \u20ac141.bn in financial assistance to Greece. The last loan tranche, another \u20ac1.8bn, is available through June if the final review is successfully completed. It\u2019s official: The European Financial Stability Facility\u2019s board of directors has extended the Greece bailout until June 30, says EFSF chief Klaus Regling. Read the full statement here. The Greek government may be nervous of exposing splits within Syriza by holding a vote on the bailout extension, but failing to hold a vote will not look great: Another update from Helena Smith in Athens: Angst over the pending funding gap is VERY real. Government figures show that tax revenues have dropped precipitously (22.5%) as a result of the political turmoil gripping the country. Greeks have simply stopped paying. The country\u2019s former deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos has just made a statement saying rather than conducting real negotiations, the new leftist-led government is waging a \u201cwar of impressions,\u201d \u201cThe country is in a strategic vacuum. Just one month after the election everything is in the air. Revenues, cash requirements, fiscal targets. How will the fiscal gap that exists be plugged? Where are we going regarding the debt? Sadly our array of negotiating mistakes has taken us way off from the point we were when the parliament was dissolved,\u201d he said referring to the day snap polls were called in December. \u201cEverything is being enthusiastically projected as a triumph, but as soon as you scratch the surface, you see that there is no plan, or result, or security or prospect. The country has to find its goals.\u201d Helena\u2019s also heard that that prime minister Alexis Tsipras will hold a cabinet meeting tonight, from 7.30pm local time, to prepare to bring legislation to parliament next week. It could be a lively evening in Athens; as the KKE communist party is organising a mass rally outside parliament to protest against the loan agreement. Apparently 29 CDU/CSU MPs voted against extending Greece\u2019s bailout, the biggest rebellion among Angela Merkel\u2019s bloc yet. The FT\u2019s Jeeven Vasagar reckons Angela Merkel has suffered a \u201csubstantial rebellion\u201d, with 32 German MPs voting against giving Greece more time. He writes: Germany\u2019s chancellor Angela Merkel faced dissent over her eurozone rescue policy on Friday after 32 legislators voted against extending Greece\u2019s bailout. While the four-month extension passed with a comfortable majority of 542 out of 587 lawmakers in the Bundestag who voted, there was a substantial rebellion within Ms Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and sister party the Christian Social Union. There were 13 abstentions. Dissent in the Bundestag has swelled since the vote over the passage of the second Greek bailout in 2012, when 13 members of her Christian Democratic bloc and four members of coalition partners, the Free Democrats, voted against. Back in Greece, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has caused quite a stir this morning by revealing that he was deliberately abstruse about targets and numbers in the list of reforms Athens proposed this week (Helena Smith writes). Varoufakis told Greek television channel ANT I that he was proud his team was so obscure while negotiating their four-month bailout extension. \u201cI use the term creative vagueness. I want to be the first minister of finance who will never refer to a number if I am not sure that I will attain it.\u201d And Varoufakis insisted that he had warned his counterparts that he didn\u2019t want to speak of numbers because he didn\u2019t want to be ultimately exposed and contradicted. The Greek finance minister also lobbed a rhetorical grenade at dissenters in the governing Syriza party. \u201cIf we wanted real freedom from Europe, we would have to exit the euro but that would be catastrophic.\u201d A quick explainer: The Bundestag vote means that Greece now has until the end of June to satisfy its lenders, and receive the final payment from its bailout programme, worth \u20ac7.2bn. That programme was due to expire on Saturday, until the eurogroup and Greece agreed a four-month extension last week. This vote doesn\u2019t actually unlock any more money, though. Greece must prove that it is implementing reforms that are acceptable to its lenders; the list of reforms submitted to Brussels earlier this week needs to be expanded and fleshed out. Germany isn\u2019t the only country that has to approve the deal. All eurozone countries have to approve it; Finland did so on Tuesday. Our Europe editor sees ructions ahead: Just as the German parliament was voting to extend Greece\u2019s loan agreement, prime minister Alexis Tsipras was convening a meeting of his entire economics team at his office. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Insiders are saying that the \u201cemergency\u201d talks Tsipras has called with his economic team are focusing on two things: \u2022 1) The financing gap that Greece faces imminently (it has to service IMF loans, which expire in March, of just under \u20ac2bn euro and has to redeem short-term debt amounting to \u20ac21.8bn by the end of June). Greek officials are increasingly voicing concerns about how such loans will be financed, amid mounting speculation that Athens may even ask the IMF to delay the repayment \u2022 2) Whether the Greek government should hold its own vote on the bailout extensions, given the level of dissent since the deal was done. The Government spokesman, Gavriel Sakellarides, suggested this morning that the bill may be debated \u201carticle by article.\u201d [to avoid one single debate over the plan] This is the biggest majority for any vote on eurozone bailouts since the crisis began, reports Germany\u2019s Spiegel news magazine. So, a pretty resounding majority in favour of the bailout extension - we don\u2019t yet know who the rebels are, though. The Bundestag voted overwhelmingly in favour of the four-month extension of the Greek bailout. Of 587 votes cast, 542 - yes 32 - no 13 - abstentions Meanwhile in Greece, a spoof video clip hailing the charms of their finance minister has caused quite a stir. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports: It got an airing on SKAI\u2019s flagship news programme last night and is doing the rounds of social media like wild-fire. The one person who has NOT commented on it is Yanis Varoufakis himself. Recently the Greek finance minister told me that he didn\u2019t have time to follow what the global media was saying of him. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a healthy contempt for the media, especially the awful tabloid media, and whether they celebrate or disparage me, it doesn\u2019t matter. I really don\u2019t care. The media pulls you up and then they dump [on] you. The more you rise, the harder the fall but it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I am ready for it \u2026 the star system was always very low in my list of priorities (many might dispute that...).\u201d It is not clear when we will get the result. Watch this space. They are counting the votes. The debate is finally over, and MPs are voting right now: The debate is nearly over. MPs will vote on the Greek bailout extension shortly. In a lively debate in the German parliament, Thorsten Frei, of the CDU/CSU, hits back at the previous speakers from his party. He says this is not about approving a new bailout, but about seeing the existing Greek bailout through to its successful conclusion. Klaus-Peter Willsch of the conservative CDS/CSU group is against extending the Greek bailout. He argues that Greece needs to crack on with reforms. Noting the high rate of youth unemployment, he deplores that labour costs in Greece are still twice as high as in Poland and Slovenia. Would you buy a used car from Tsipras or Varoufakis, he asks. He ends with a well-known German proverb (Lieber ein Ende mit Schrecken als ein Schrecken ohne Ende): Better an end with terror than terror without an end.[i.e. It\u2019s best to get unpleasant things over and done with.] Eckhart Rehberg, also of the CDU/CSU, asserts: Greece doesn\u2019t need a Marshall plan. Greece [already] has a Marshall plan. Solidarity is not a one-way street. Sch\u00e4fer calls for mutual understanding, rather than provocative statements (this is partly aimed at his parliamentary colleagues). He stresses There is no German diktat for Athens. There is a debate. Holding up a copy of mass daily Bild\u2019s \u201cNein!\u201d page, Axel Sch\u00e4fer of the SPD says: We do not support campaigns against other countries. [Bild yesterday asked readers to send selfies, posing alongside its declaration that \u201cGreedy Greeks\u201d should not get more money] Sch\u00e4fer also refers to the London Debt Conference, when Germany\u2019s creditors agreed to write off about half of the country\u2019s debt. That conference began 62 years ago today. But he also takes issue with Greek prime minister Aleix Tsipras comments \u201cwe\u2019ve won a battle but not the war\u201d. He says no one is fighting battles in Europe. CSU general secretary Andreas Scheuer calls on Greece \u201cto deliver\u201d (reforms). The German parliamentary debate continues. Solidarity (in Europe) is today\u2019s watchword. A quick recap from today\u2019s debate on Greece\u2019s aid package, now we\u2019ve heard from all the main German political parties: German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has called on the Bundestag to support Greece\u2019s four-month bailout extension. Sch\u00e4uble told MPs that Greece is not getting more money today: We\u2019re not talking about new billions for Greece, we\u2019re not talking about any changes to this programme - rather it\u2019s about providing or granting extra time to successfully end this programme. He admitted it wasn\u2019t \u201can easy decision for any parliament member,\u201d adding \u201cGreece has to do its bit. Solidarity has something to do with reliability\u201d. Sch\u00e4uble won the most applause when he insisted that Germany must do everything it can to hold Europe together. Other politicians from across the spectrum have emphasised the importance of avoiding new divisions in Europe. Although there was disagreement about how Greece\u2019s plight came about. Ralph Brinkhaus of the ruling CDU/CSU party insisted that the problems predated Greece\u2019s first aid package, and that other eurozone bailouts had been successful. Gregor Gysi of Die Linke party said Greece \u201ckamikaze policy\u201d of austerity must be changed. Carsten Schneider of SPD said that wealthy Greeks must make a bigger contribution to its finances, and also acknowledged that Greece may need a third bailout: For the Greens, Anton Hofreiter called for more solidarity: This conflict is about the interests of a few super-rich people versus ordinary people in Greeks. The vote should start soon, and we\u2019re expecting a large majority in favour. But how many CDU/CSU MPs will rebel?... Brinkhaus also criticises the Greek government for inconsistency: \u201cIt\u2019s really bad if someone leaves the [euro] project,\u201d he concludes. Brinkhaus says five countries received bailouts during the financial crisis, and regards four out of those five a success. Portugal said yesterday it would pay back its loans early. This shows that it\u2019s worth saying yes sometimes. And even with Greece things didn\u2019t go too badly until December. He stresses that the vote is not about a new bailout, but extending the old (second) bailout for Greece. Angela Merkel is also in the chamber, sat alongside economy minister Sigmar Gabriel. He\u2019s next to foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier: Ralph Brinkhaus of the ruling CDU/CSU (conservatives) is next. He stresses that Greece\u2019s problems were not caused by the troika but date back longer, and that Europe has been very generous in its help. Hofreiter, of the Greens, says the litmus test is whether policies are helping ordinary Greeks. He adds that Greece should stay in Europe. If Greece regains some of its wealth there is a bigger chance it will repay its debts. Hofreiter talks about the failure of Angela Merkel\u2019s and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s European policies. We need a European policy based on solidarity, he contends. He adds: This conflict is about the interests of a few super-rich people versus ordinary people in Greeks. Anton Hofreiter of the Greens is now speaking. Schneider says: We support growth, help to self-help and more social justice. But it must be clear that those who who have earned a lot and have wealth in Greece must pay. He says a return to the drachma is not the answer, because Greece\u2019s debts are denominated in euros. The drachma would most likely plummet and a 50% depreciation would double Greek debts. He concludes by saying It\u2019s now up the Greeks themselves, we are extending our hands to them. Greece is not paying interest on its debt any more, Schneider says. [That is true, because of the restructuring.] It is important for the Greeks to realise they can help themselves. Sch\u00e4uble said earlier that \u201cit\u2019s not easy to make this decision\u201d (on the bailout extension). Schneider of the SPD says he feels similar. The Bundestag debate is due to last 105 minutes, followed by a vote on the bailout extension until 30 June for Greece. It started on time at 8am GMT. Carsten Schneider of the SPD (Social Democrats) is next. The Left party supports the four-month bailout extension for Greece to give the country \u201cbreathing space and the chance for a fresh start,\u201d Gysi says, ending his statement. Gysi of the German Left party contends: We need a Marshall plan for southern Europe. 90% of the bailout money is going to French and German banks, Gysi says. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s early take on Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s speech: Gregor Gysi, who heads up the parliamentary group of the Left party, is up next. The newly elected left-wing government in Greece has called an end to cuts and austerity, he says. He describes it as a \u201ckamikaze policy,\u201d which led to high youth unemployment and recession. Syriza is the first government in Europe that has challenged neoliberal policies, he asserts. With this kind of policy debts will never be repaid. There is no logic. We must help rebuild Greece, so it can repay its debts. France has implemented important structural reforms and Italy is on track to make good decisions, the German finance minister says. Greece within Europe cannot decide alone what the right path is. That concludes his statement. There is a lot of applause from MPs. But, he says in a veiled dig at the new Greek government: Solidarity doesn\u2019t mean that you can blackmail each other. Sch\u00e4uble says Europe must stand together and makes an oblique reference to WWII. Applause from MPs. We Germans must do everything to keep Europe together. Sch\u00e4uble says it will take Greece longer than other countries to win back the trust of financial markets. But he adds: Greece has to do its bit. Solidarity has something to do with reliability. Reuters is snapping the key points from Sch\u00e4uble: GERMAN FIN MIN SCHAEUBLE SAYS GERMAN PARLIAMENT DOESN\u2019T FACE EASY DECISION ON GREEK BAILOUT EXTENSION GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS NOT ABOUT MORE MONEY OR CHANGE IN TERMS FOR GREECE, JUST MORE TIME SCHAEUBLE SAYS GREECE CAN\u2019T CHANGE THE BAILOUT PROGRAMME WITHOUT AGREEMENT OF IMF, EU AND ECB Sch\u00e4uble is explaining that Greece is simply being given more time to complete its bailout measures, and that it cannot change the terms unilaterally. Sch\u00e4uble says: We are all democracies. Greece produced a clear vote [when it elected the Syriza government]. Not much applause from German MPs Greece has pledged not to take unilateral measures \u2013 without agreement of the troika (the IMF, EU and ECB), the German finance minister explains. The Bundestag session has started. The finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, speaks first. He stresses that the four-month bailout extension is NOT about new billions of euros for Greece or changes to the bailout. Applause from German MPs You can watch the Bundestag debate live here. It will start in a few minutes. A large majority of Germans, across the political spectrum, doubt that Greece will implement its reform programme. Germany\u2019s opposition Green party has also pledged to support Greece in today\u2019s vote: There was isolated violence in the Greek capital last night, for the first time since last month\u2019s general election. It occurred after a demonstration by far-left activists in Athens, unhappy with the bailout extension agreed with Greece\u2019s creditors. The BBC reports: \u201cDozens of activists hurled petrol bombs and stones at police and set cars alight after the march. About 450 far-left protesters took to the streets of Athens on Thursday to voice their anger. After the march, about 50 demonstrators clashed with riot police. Shop windows and bus stops were also smashed. It sounds quite small scale: And it\u2019s calm this morning: Even Germany\u2019s president Joachim Gauck has waded into the Greece debate and come out in support of the four-month bailout extension. (Like the Queen, the German president traditionally stays above the political fray). Gauck,75, told radio station MDR: \u201cThe parliament is willing to take responsibility and is taking on the issue with great seriousness.\u201d He said the Bundestag, the German parliament\u2019s lower chamber, has to ask itself what Europe would gain if it were to lose part of its community, German mass daily Bild and other newspapers reported. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of Greece\u2019s debt crisis and other developments across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. German MPs are voting today on whether Greece\u2019s bailout should be extended by four months. The Bundestag (the lower house of the German parliament), is pretty much certain to approve it, with a decent majority. But today\u2019s debate is also important because it will shine a light on the state of German-Greek relations. They look increasingly strained by the events of recent weeks. As our Europe editor Ian Traynor explains: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the finance minister, told Merkel\u2019s backbenchers that the new Greek government was manipulating eurozone largesse to \u201ctrample all over European solidarity\u201d, Der Spiegel reported. The Germans expect the Greeks, beneficiaries of a \u20ac240bn (\u00a3175bn) rescue, to be grateful. Instead they are seen to be impertinent. No sooner was the ink dry on the deal on Tuesday granting Athens a 17-week loan extension than its finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, upped the ante and demanded the massive debt burden be partly written off. Sch\u00e4uble virtually accused the Tsipras team of lying. \u201cThe question now is whether one can believe the Greek government\u2019s assurances or not. There\u2019s a lot of doubt in Germany.\u201d The word in Brussels is that Sch\u00e4uble and Varoufakis can hardly bear to be in the same room together. The confrontation looks certain to get worse over the next month as Tsipras sets out the fiscal and economic reforms he must enact to win the bailout extension and then, over the summer, a new package of financial aid. Full story: Greece bailout saga strains German patience The debate starts at 9am CET in Berlin (8am GMT or 10am EET), and probably lasts for 90 minutes followed by a vote. Some 22 MPS from Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU party voted against the extensions at an \u2018indicative ballot\u2019 yesterday; a small rebellion that won\u2019t scupper the vote, but which puts pressure on the Chancellor to maintain a tough line with Athens in the months ahead. We\u2019ll be covering the debate, the results, reaction, and other events through the day....",

Instead they are seen to be impertinent. No sooner was the ink dry on the deal on Tuesday granting Athens a 17-week loan extension than its finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, upped the ante and demanded the massive debt burden be partly written off.</p> <p>Sch\u00e4uble virtually accused the Tsipras team of lying. \u201cThe question now is whether one can believe the Greek government\u2019s assurances or not. There\u2019s a lot of doubt in Germany.\u201d</p> <p>The word in Brussels is that Sch\u00e4uble and Varoufakis can hardly bear to be in the same room together. The confrontation looks certain to get worse over the next month as Tsipras sets out the fiscal and economic reforms he must enact to win the bailout extension and then, over the summer, a new package of financial aid.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Full story: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/26/greece-bailout-saga-strains-german-patience\">Greece bailout saga strains German patience</a></h2> <p><strong>The debate starts at 9am CET in Berlin (8am GMT or 10am EET), and probably lasts for 90 minutes followed by a vote.</strong></p> <p>Some 22 MPS from Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU party voted against the extensions at an \u2018indicative ballot\u2019 yesterday; a small rebellion that won\u2019t scupper the vote, but which puts pressure on the Chancellor to maintain a tough line with Athens in the months ahead.</p> <p><em><strong>We\u2019ll be covering the debate, the results, reaction, and other events through the day....</strong></em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-02-27T07:36:27.741Z\">at 7.36am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Justin King, the former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, is expected to be confirmed as part of team backing the revival of the Manor Marussia Formula One team. Racing industry insiders said motor racing fan King, whose son Jordan is a Formula Two driver, would not have an executive role at Marussia, which is aiming to take part in the season-opening Australian grand prix on 15 March. The team, which began as Virgin Racing, pulled out of the last three races of the 2014 season after getting into financial difficulties. Eight months after leaving the supermarket group, King, who had been tipped to replace Bernie Ecclestone as the head of Formula One, is still looking for a major new role. King recently also joined the chicken processing firm 2 Sisters as an adviser, in his first confirmed role since leaving the supermarket. The part-time, temporary role at one of the biggest suppliers to British supermarkets will involve helping 2 Sisters chief executive and controlling shareholder Ranjit Singh map out a future for the group. King is credited with turning around the fortunes of Sainsbury\u2019s, where he spent 10 years before leaving just as a long stint of sales growth came to an end. A 2 Sisters spokesman said: \u201cJustin knows our business well from his time at Marks &amp; Spencer and more recently at Sainsbury\u2019s, and we look forward to working with him and drawing from his considerable knowledge and expertise.\u201d The food group, which owns Fox\u2019s biscuits, pizza brand Goodfella\u2019s and Holland\u2019s Pies, was one of two chicken processors at which a Guardian investigation last summer uncovered a series of hygiene failings. Breakdowns in machinery led to high-risk material such as feathers, guts and offal piling up while production continued at a 2 Sisters factory in Wales. King takes up his role, first reported by Sky News, as the whole poultry industry comes under scrutiny for the prevalence of the potentially lethal food poisoning bug campylobacter in supermarket chicken. A report by the food industry watchdog published earlier this week found nearly three-quarters of chickens sold in supermarkets were contaminated with the bug, 19% at a high level. The 2 Sisters group is among several suppliers seeking new ways to tackle the bug. It put rapid-chilling technology in place at several of its facilities in September as part of a five-point plan.",

      "bodyText": "The German parliament has backed the extension of the Greek bailout by four months with an overwhelming majority \u2013 the biggest yet of any Bundestag vote on measures to fight the European debt crisis. But in a sign of growing scepticism over Greece\u2019s financial aid package within Germany, 29 MPs from Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU bloc rebelled and voted against the plan. A total of 542 MPs voted in favour, with just 32 MPs voting against and 13 abstaining. The finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, admitted at the start of the session: \u201cThis is not an easy decision for any parliament member.\u201d He also told MPs that Greece is not getting more money. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about new billions for Greece, we\u2019re not talking about any changes to this programme \u2013 rather it\u2019s about providing or granting extra time to successfully end this programme.\u201d The extension will give Greece breathing space to hammer out a new reform programme with the much-loathed troika \u2013 the EU, IMF and European Central Bank. The bailout would otherwise expire on Saturday. The Bundestag vote was important because Germany is the dominant force in the eurozone. It means that Greece now has until the end of June to satisfy its lenders, before it can receive the final payment from its bailout programme, worth \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.2bn). Greece\u2019s financial position is still precarious, as it must repay a \u20ac1.6bn IMF loan in March and \u20ac7.5bn of maturing bonds held by the ECB in July and August. The European Financial Stability Facility\u2019s board of directors has officially extended the Greece bailout until 30 June. So far, the EFSF has handed \u20ac141.bn in financial assistance to Greece. Friday\u2019s vote came after a small group of protesters attacked cars and shops in Athens, after the first anti-government demonstrations since the leftwing Syriza goverment swept to power a month ago. Kicking off a lively parliamentary debate that frequently featured the word solidarity from across the political spectrum, Sch\u00e4uble stressed: \u201cGreece has to do its bit. Solidarity has something to do with reliability.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble won much applause from MPs when he insisted that Germany must do everything it can to hold Europe together. The Left and the Green parties had previously signalled their support alongside the parliamentary groups of the ruling CDU/CSU and SPD parties. Gregor Gysi of Die Linke (Left) party said Greece\u2019s \u201ckamikaze policy\u201d of austerity must be changed. Meanwhile, Carsten Schneider of the SPD (Social Democrats) said that wealthy Greeks must make a bigger contribution to the country\u2019s finances, and also acknowledged that Greece may need a third bailout. Referring to the Greek prime minister and finance minister, Klaus-Peter Willsch of Merkel\u2019s CDU party, who opposed the bailout extension, said: \u201cLook at Tsipras, look at Varoufakis, would you buy a used-car from these men?\u201d. Thursday\u2019s edition of Bild carried a giant \u201cNein!\u201d headline, adding: \u201cNo more billions for the greedy Greeks!\u2019\u2019 The newspaper asked readers to send selfies posing alongside its declaration. Holding up the page, SPD MP Axel Sch\u00e4fer said: \u201cWe do not support campaigns against other countries.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Lloyds Banking Group is being handed \u00a311.5m in pay and share bonuses as the bailed out bank resumes dividends to shareholders for the first time since its taxpayer rescue seven years ago. Unions were outraged by the package for Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, which includes a \u00a37.5m bonus from a three-year scheme but excludes \u00a33.6m of shares he is being handed under a new long-term incentive plan. His ten-strong management team, assembled after he took the helm in 2011, cashed in \u00a323m under the same three year plan \u2013 which 800 top staff also participated in \u2013 and are being handed \u00a320m of shares in the new three-year bonus scheme. The payments were revealed as the bank \u2013 which has the largest private shareholder base in the UK with some 3 million small investors \u2013 announced it would pay a dividend of 0.75p a share for 2014, worth \u00a3535m. Taxpayers will get around \u00a3130m from the first dividend since 2008, when the EU blocked payments under the terms of the taxpayer rescue and the bank lacked the financial muscle to offer them. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cThis \u00a37.5m bonus will outrage customers and the taxpayers who bailed out the bank. And with the government being the biggest shareholder, voters will want to know why they have not acted to hold back this excess. It is as if the banking crisis never happened and it\u2019s 2006 all over again.\u201d The Robin Hood Tax campaign, which wants a levy on the financial system, condemned the \u201clottery-sized awards\u201d, while Labour Treasury spokeswoman Cathy Jamieson said people \u201cwill be rightly taken aback by the huge scale of the bonuses being paid \u2013 especially when Lloyds continues to be part-owned by the taxpayer\u201d. Lord Blackwell, chairman of Lloyds, said the bonuses were the result of \u201ctremendous\u201d performance. \u201cPeople should celebrate the fact the management team have delivered a great achievement,\u201d Blackwell said. Profits for 2014 rose fourfold year-on-year to \u00a31.8bn, taking into account a further \u00a3700m provision for payment protection insurance (PPI) \u2013 bringing the bank\u2019s total bill for the mis-selling scandal to more than \u00a312bn \u2013 and the \u00a3217m fine for rigging Libor imposed last year. The overall bonus pool was 3% lower at \u00a3370m and 49 bankers were paid more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3730,000). George Osborne, the chancellor, said of the resumption of the dividend: \u201cThis is good news not only for taxpayers, who will get at least another \u00a3100m from the dividend, but also for millions of savers who hold Lloyds shares or have money invested in Lloyds through their pensions.\u201d The bonuses need to be voted on by UK Financial Investments, which controls the taxpayer stakes in the bailed out banks, at the annual meeting on May 14 \u2013 just days after the general election. Horta-Os\u00f3rio acknowledged that his pay was high. \u201cI would expect in this country and with the culture in the country that you focus on pay for performance,\u201d he said. He said the stock market value of the bank had increased significantly since the bonus shares were awarded in March 2012 when they traded at 34.7p each. They are now worth 79p. John Cridland, boss of the employers\u2019 body the CBI, leapt to the bank\u2019s defence. \u201cThe CBI has been clear that rewards for failure are unacceptable but legitimate financial rewards for success should not be vilified,\u201d said Cridland Horta-Os\u00f3rio has embarked on the second of his three-year plans for the bank, which includes axing 9,000 jobs and closing 200 branches. Around 15,000 roles were lost under his first strategic plan. In light of the revelations that Stuart Gulliver, boss of HSBC, has as bank account in Switzerland routed through Panama, Horta-Os\u00f3rio \u2013 who is Portuguese \u2013 said he was non-domiciled and paid tax on all his Lloyds earnings. He refused to say where his personal accounts were held. In an attempt to appease any anger, he said that he would not sell any of the shares he was receiving from his bonus until the taxpayers\u2019 stake had been further reducedand that his future bonuses were linked to the government\u2019s stake falling further. The government\u2019s stake in the bank has shrunk from 43% to below 24%. Bonuses for the management team from 2012 and 2013 were being withheld because of the ongoing investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into the bank\u2019s handling of complaints for PPI. Even so, \u00a32m of shares awarded in 2011 were released to the management team and \u00a33.3m of shares were awarded to the top management in annual bonuses for 2014. The dividend was lower than the 1p that some analysts had expected but Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cWe are not particularly concerned by the fact that this is smaller than we anticipated as management had always said it would be a token effort at first.\u201d Finance director George Culmer said the aim was to have a dividend payout ratio of at least 50% of sustainable earnings. The pages of legal warnings attached to the Lloyds results also cover its Swiss banking operations which it sold in 2013. The bank had been participating in the US justice department\u2019s investigation into potential tax avoidance but is no longer doing so.",
