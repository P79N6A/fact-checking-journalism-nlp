      "bodyText": "This liveblog is now closed, but you can catch-up with all the latest developments here: And finally, the Turkish crisis makes the front page of Tuesday\u2019s Guardian: The Times is reporting that UK holidaymakers are taking advantage of the fact they can now get eight lira to the pound: President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s defiant speech makes the front page of the Independent, and the Financial Times: That\u2019s all for today. We\u2019ll back on Tuesday morning, UK time, with the latest market action. Stay tuned to the Guardian website in the meantime, for any breaking developments. Goodnight! GW Over in Asia, the markets are cranking back into action for Tuesday\u2019s session. And so far, the lira looks quite orderly - trading just below 7 lira to the US dollar, as in Europe earlier. The US stock market has close down lower tonight, as the Turkey crisis weighted on sentiment. The Dow shed 125 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 25,187. The wider S&amp;P 500 lost 0.4%. Energy companies led the sell off, dropping by 1.2%. Banks and miners lost 1%, reflecting worries that the lira crisis could create financial turmoil and dent economic demand. After a busy day, here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the Turkish crisis: A fresh plunge in the Turkish lira sent tremors through global currency markets on Monday, amid fears that the failure of Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government to tackle its worsening financial crisis would have a domino effect on other vulnerable countries. The Argentine peso and the South African rand were the biggest knock-on casualties of a day of turbulence that saw the lira fall 8% against the dollar and Erdogan lash out at \u201ceconomic terrorists on social media\u201d, as he accused Donald Trump of stabbing Turkey in the back. But the Turkish president\u2019s insistence that his country would survive an economic siege failed to reassure financial markets alarmed at the possible collapse of the strategically-vital emerging market country. Concerns that the 45% drop in the value of the lira this year would prove ruinous for companies that had borrowed heavily in foreign currencies prompted the renewed sell off of the lira and pushed up the cost of servicing Turkey\u2019s budget deficit. Erdogan insisted that the Turkish economy was fundamentally sound and attacked the US president for imposing sanctions and doubling tariffs on Turkey\u2019s steel and aluminium imports last week over the house arrest of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, on disputed terrorism charges. \u201cWe are together in NATO and then you stab your strategic partner in the back,\u201d Erdogan said as he came under pressure from the markets to respond to the lira\u2019s fall and an inflation rate of more than 15%. Here\u2019s the full story: My colleague Martin Chulov has discovered that the lira crisis has been fuelled by a misunderstanding between the leaders of the US and Turkey. He writes: The currency plunge imperilling Turkey\u2019s economy has been fuelled by a standoff between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan over the fate of a Turkish woman detained in Israel whose freedom the US president brokered, and an American pastor held in Turkey whose release he demands in return, officials in Ankara claim. Those officials say that Trump may have \u2018misinterpreted\u2019 a discussion with Erdo\u011fan over the pair - Turkish woman Ebru \u00d6zkan, jailed for alleged links to Hamas (but released last month), and Andrew Brunson, a preacher from North Carolina. It appears that Trump thought he had reached a deal for Brunson\u2019s release, while Erdo\u011fan believed he\u2019d agreed to transfer the pastor to house arrest (as happened in July). Martin explains: \u201cIt took place on the margins of the Nato summit,\u201d the source told the Guardian. \u201cErdo\u011fan asked Trump for help with the lady in prison in Israel. There was only the two of them and a translator. Trump said: \u2018I need some traction on the pastor first\u2019. When Erdo\u011fan said OK he meant that we are working on it. Then [US vice-president Mike] Pence, due to midterm election considerations, messed things up. Trump confused a process for an agreement.\u201d That might explains why the White House has taken such a tough line on Turkey this week, imposing new sanction and starting the process to double tariffs on steel and aluminium. One late newsflash: Argentina\u2019s central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate to a blistering 45% (!), from 40%. As explained earlier, the peso hit a record low as the Turkish crisis rocked emerging market currencies (and as a political scandal continued to shake confidence). This rate hike is aimed at preventing the peso plunging even further, and suggest Buenos Aires is concerned that the markets could become more volatile in the days ahead. Time for a recap The currency crisis gripping Turkey has deepened today, sending ripples through the financial world and hurting emerging market countries across the globe. Fears over Turkey\u2019s financial position sent its currency spiralling to a fresh record low, hitting 7.2 lira to the US dollar. The lira has now lost a third of its value in the last week, as the crisis has escalated alarmingly. Turkey\u2019s stock market also had a rough day, with bank shares tumbling by over 10%. Economists fear that Turkish companies will struggle to repay loans priced in dollars, given the lira\u2019s plunge in value. Contagion caused jitters elsewhere too, with India\u2019s rupee and Argentina\u2019s peso dropping to record lows. The Russian rouble and the South African rand hit levels not seen since 2016. A cocktail of problems are to blame, from Turkey\u2019s surging inflation rate and current account deficit to the diplomatic row with America that means the Turkish economy faces punishing sanctions. Investors believe that Turkey needs to take decisive action, such as hiking interest rates from their current level of 17.75% to an even more painful rate - perhaps over 27%. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is refusing to bow to pressure from the markets, though. He told an audience of ambassadors in Ankara that Turkey was under attack from overseas interests: \u201cThe developments over recent weeks have shown that Turkey is under siege. It is clear that these attacks will continue for a while.\u201d Erdo\u011fan also blasted US sanctions against its NATO ally, calling them a \u201cstab in the back against Turkey.\u201d Turkey\u2019s central bank has taken some steps to prop up the lira. It has pledged to \u201cprovide all the liquidity the banks need\u201d, which should help them to keep providing loans to people and businesses. Delphine Arrighi, fund manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, argues that borrowing costs must rise to prevent the lira plunging to fresh depths. \u201cOther options could include capital controls, which seem more likely than an appeal to the IMF, but that would certainly not be the least painful and would most likely precipitate a recession while postponing the return of portfolio inflows. Hence a sizable rate hike followed by drastic measures of fiscal consolidation still appear as the most viable option to re-anchor the lira and pull the Turkish economy from the brink. Turkish authorities have also launched a crackdown against social media accounts, which it blames for spreading \u2018fake news\u2019 and undermining confidence in the economy. Even German chancellor Angela Merkel has weighed in, saying she hoped Turkey could be economically prosperous. She also called for Turkey\u2019s central bank to be properly independent -- a touchy subject, as Erdo\u011fan has been pushing it not to raise interest rates. There are fears that currency speculators could drive Turkey deeper into the crisis in the days ahead: And on the streets of Turkey, people have spoken of their concerns as import prices jump and the value of their savings shrinks. One told the Guardian: \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand any of it. I think it\u2019s political. Erdo\u011fan argues with Trump, and we end up trapped in a corner.\u201d \u201cWe can just pray to God,\u201d he added. The US stock market is heading lower, as worries over Turkey ripple weigh on Wall Street. Banks are bearing the brunt, with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan both down around 1%. Traders remain worried that the Turkish crisis will escalate, unless Ankara takes more decisive steps - such as an interest rate hike. A bit more from Ed Conway: After a day of heavy losses, Turkey\u2019s stock exchange has closed deep in the red with the benchmark BIST 100 index losing 2.4%. Financial stocks felt the full blast of the currency crisis, with some bank stocks falling by over 10%. The slump is even worse if you adjust for the depreciation of the lira, points out Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway in this thread about the situation in Turkey: Our economics editor Larry Elliott has written a new Q&amp;A on the Turkish crisis. Here\u2019s a flavour: What are the implications for the global economy? The direct impact of what looks like an inevitable recession in Turkey would be relatively small because, despite a population of 80 million and strong growth in recent years, the country accounts for only 1% of global GDP. Eurozone countries run a trade surplus with Turkey but it is small. In the two previous Turkish financial crises since the turn of the millennium, European exporters have been able to divert their business to other markets. The European Central Bank has expressed concern about potential contagion through the eurozone banking system, with Spain, followed by Italy, the most heavily exposed countries. A bigger danger is that Turkey\u2019s crisis will spill over into other emerging market economies and there were signs on Monday that other countries seen as vulnerable were coming under speculative attack. Turkey\u2019s problems are particularly acute because it has more than $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt, which is getting more expensive to finance by the day. However, other countries \u2013 such as Mexico and South Africa - also took advantage of low US interest rates in the years after the financial crisis to borrow heavily in dollars and saw their currencies coming under pressure. The fear is of a full-blown emerging market crisis. The lira is weakening in late trading, and is threatening to plunge back the 7 lira-to-the-US dollar mark to a new all-time low. Andy Birch, principal economist at IHS Markit, fears the lira will keep tumbling until Turkey raises interest rates: The changes to reserve requirements in recent days and the government\u2019s unspecified action plan has done little to stabilize the lira. Significantly more than just official promises of action are needed to exit the current crisis. IHS Markit continues to believe that the most immediate step to be taken to rescue the lira is a sharp central bank rate rise. If this step is taken in conjunction with a shifting of government rhetoric, the plunge of the lira could pause and portfolio investment outflows may slow. Turkish citizens are struggling to cope with the impact of the lira\u2019s astonishing losses in recent days, report Kareem Shaheen and Gokce Saracoglu in Istanbul. Some fear their businesses could shut down, while others who support the president say they will buy domestic products and shun goods from abroad. Those who cater to tourists, however, hope that the decline in the value of the currency will bring more foreign holidaymakers to the country. All declined to give their full names. \u201cGo your way, nothing will happen to this country, I\u2019ve seen the lira much lower than this in the 1990s,\u201d said one foreign exchange office worker. Money-changing offices in Istanbul were selling dollars at a much higher rate than the banks on Monday, however, saying the fluctuation in the currency\u2019s value was so unstable as to render the price they set meaningless. One vegetable and fruit seller said he had been forced to raise the price of imported products. A kilogram of bananas that cost 10 lira last week was now 15 lira. \u201cWe need to send Erdo\u011fan away,\u201d he said. While ordinary Turks struggle to absorb the effects of high inflation and a declining currency, some foreigners who earn salaries in dollars and tourists are buying up luxury items. Pictures on social media over the weekend showed queues of foreigners outside stores such as Luis Vuitton and Chanel. \u201cA lot of tourists, especially Arabs, buy from our store,\u201d said the manager of a high-end design store in Galata. \u201cBut every 15 days we have to buy new supplies from Europe. Here\u2019s their full report: European stock markets have closed in the red, as Turkish worries weigh on shares. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 shed 24 points, or 0.3%, to end the day at 7642. Holiday firm TUI was the worst-performing stock on the Footsie, losing 2.5%. Last week, it revealed it was taking a financial hit on euro-denominated loans taken out to fund hotel building in Turkey. The lira\u2019s losses push up the cost of repaying that debt. European banks with exposure to the Turkish economy also had a bad day. Spain\u2019s BBVA lost 3.2% while Unicredit shed 2.5%. Argentina has been hit by the anxiety rippling through the financial markets today. The peso has fallen to a record low, at around 30 pesos to the US dollar. Back in April it was trading around the 20 mark, before a slump in market confidence forced Buenos Aires to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The peso is also being driven down by an unfolding scandal involving alleged bribes made to former officials of the Kirchner government (which was in power until 2015). More than a dozen business people have been arrested, after it emerged that the chauffeur of a former government official had kept diaries which allege to show payments totalling millions of dollars. The ongoing investigation has also hit share and bond prices, as traders wonder whether more executives, or politicians, will be dragged in. Despite today\u2019s drama, currency exchange offices have been operating as normal in Turkey today. Here are some photos from Istanbul: While the slump in the lira is bad news for Turkish citizens, it\u2019s something of a boon for tourists. For example, one pound is now worth 8.8 lira -- compared to just 4.5 lira a year ago. That makes Turkey an attractive destination for Brits, driving down the cost of accommodation and food. Economics columnist Matt O\u2019Brien has written a pithy explanation of the Turkish financial crisis, which new readers might find particularly helpful: In another worrying sign, the cost of insuring Turkish government bonds has jumped today. The cost of a five-year credit default swap (which would pay out if Ankara can\u2019t repay its bonds) jumped to 573 basis points, up from 452bp on Friday. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit, and suggests Turkish debt is now seen as riskier. Technically, it means it would cost $573,000 per year to insure $10m of Turkish debt. After several hours of volatile trading, the Turkish lira has settled around 6.87 lira to the US dollar. That\u2019s a loss of around 7% today (a whopping move by usual standards), but also a small recovery on the record low of 7.2 struck overnight. It also means the lira has still lost a third of its value in the last week. The news that the Turkish central bank is offering more liquidity to commercial banks (see earlier post) seems to have stemmed the panic. However, investors still want to see more comprehensive action to tackle its inflation and current account deficit, such as a massive hike in interest rates. Reto Foellmi, economist from the University of St Gallen, fears that further lira losses could be disastrous: The vibrant growth of Turkey relied heavily on financing in foreign-currency debt. While Turkish exports get cheaper, Turkish companies face higher repayment obligations of the loans which hurts banks as well. As the Lira has a reputation as a weak currency, Erdogan\u2019s rhetoric puts oil into the fire. With a further weakening of the Lira, Turkey faces a downward spiral, where default could be the end. The Turkish crisis dragged world stock markets to a one-month low today. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.6% this morning, as the Turkish lira hit fresh record lows against the US dollar. That was driven by losses in Asia overnight, in Europe this morning, and at emerging markets across the world. Dean Popplewell of City firm OANDA says anxiety over Turkey has \u201cseverely bullied emerging markets into near submission.\u201d In Japan, the Nikkei tumbled -2% to a five-week low overnight as a sell-off in emerging market currencies frightened investors, with the safe-haven yen\u2019s (\u00a5110.20) appreciation also hurting sentiment. The broader Topix dropped -2.1%. Down-under, Aussie shares ended lower overnight, weighed down by materials and banks after the crisis in Turkey hit Asian assets, while global trade turmoil pushed commodity prices lower. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 index fell -0.4%. In S. Korea, the Kospi ended down -1.5%, in line with other Asian countries. However, America\u2019s stock market is holding its nerve. Wall Street is calm in early trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 60 points (or 0.23%). The EIU\u2019s Agathe Demarais adds that Turkey has a lot of work to do to regain market confidence -- but it\u2019s not clear that such measures will be taken..... With an overheated and indebted economy, Turkey will require credibly orthodox economic policies, fiscal discipline and central bank independence to reverse the current situation. A normalisation of relations with the US could also reduce the amount of legwork that the central bank will have to do to control the economic situation, but this is unlikely to happen at the moment. In view of the domestic political and economic conditions, it is therefore unclear whether the necessary steps will be taken to contain the market fallout. Agathe Demarais, Turkey analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, has predicted that Western banks will suffer losses from the Turkish lira\u2019s slump soon. She told the AFP newswire that the impact of the currency crisis will ripple through the financial world, as Turkish companies find they can\u2019t service loans taken out in dollars. \u201cSo far the impact of the lira crash has been limited in Europe and the rest of the world. \u201cHowever, within a few months western banks that have strong ties with Turkey will feel the impact of the crisis as Turkish corporates will struggle to repay debt in foreign currency. \u201cThe sharp depreciation of the lira has almost doubled the local currency value of external debt repayments since the start of the year.\u201d German chancellor Angela Merkel has now waded into the crisis, urging Turkey to ensure the independence of its central bank. Merkel told a news conference in Berlin that: \u201cNo one has an interest in an economic destabilisation inTurkey. But everything must be done to ensure an independent central bank,. Germany would like to see an economically prosperous Turkey. This is in our interest.\u201d The Turkish central bank has been restricted by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s opposition to higher borrowing costs (he believes they cause inflation, while most economists believe they restrict it). Turkish interest rates are currently 17.75% -- very high by current standards. Some City experts, though, argue they should be hiked by over 1000 basis points (to around 27%) to prop up the lira. And here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take on the Turkish leader\u2019s speech earlier today. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country is under an economic \u201csiege\u201d that has nothing to do with its economic indicators. During an address to Turkish ambassadors in the capital, Ankara, Erdogan said Monday that Turkey would overcome the \u201cattack\u201d on its economy. He insisted that Turkey\u2019s economy remains strong and said the currency would soon settle \u201cat the most reasonable level.\u201d In an apparent reference to the United States, Erdogan said \u201cthe bullies of the global system cannot roughly, shamelessly encroach on our gains that were paid for by blood.\u201d The Turkish leader\u2019s comments came after authorities launched investigations into hundreds of social media accounts for alleged reports they claimed were helping the currency\u2019s plunge. Erdogan said there is an \u201ceconomic terror\u201d being waged on social media, adding that \u201ctraitors\u201d would be punished. Here\u2019s Reuters first take on the Erdo\u011fan speech: President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said on Monday he expected attacks on Turkey\u2019s economy to continue but predicted the lira would return to \u201crational levels\u201d soon, after the Turkish currency hit a record low of more than 7 to the U.S. dollar. Erdo\u011fan, who has described the lira\u2019s fall as the consequence of a plot rather than economic fundamentals, also said that spreading false news about the economy was treason and recent U.S. actions were a stab in the back against Ankara. Here\u2019s a clip of president Erdo\u011fan addressing the Ambassadors\u2019 conference a moment ago: The lira is weakening, following Erdo\u011fan\u2019s claim that America is trying to stab Turkey in the back. It has dropped back to 6.9 lira to the US dollar, close to this morning\u2019s record low of 7.2. President Erdo\u011fan has also declared that spreading false news about false news about Turkey\u2019s economy is \u201ctreason\u201d. That follows this morning\u2019s crackdown on social media accounts blamed for sharing misleading information about the crisis. Heads-up: Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is giving a speech now, 10th annual Ambassadors\u2019 Conference in Ankara. Bloomberg say Erdo\u011fan has told the conference that Turkey must prepare for further attacks on its economy. He has accused America of breaking World Trade Organisation principles (presumably by doubling tariffs on Turkish metal exports last week). Erdo\u011fan adds that America is trying to stab Turkey in the back. On the market turmoil, Erdo\u011fan has told his audience that the lira would settle at a rational level soon. There is no \u2018economic basis\u2019 for recent exchange rate moves, he adds. There will also be no retreat from free market economic policies, he insists. More details to follow soon Some UK stocks are taking a direct hit from the Turkey crisis. Travel firm TUI is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down 3.3% this morning. In theory, the slump in the lira makes Turkey a more attractive holiday destination. In practice, reports of financial instability are likely to deter tourists. Ashmore, a fund manager focused on emerging markets, is down 5%. Stockbroker AJ Bell explains: \u201cFund management group Ashmore is widely seen as the London-listed bellwether for emerging markets and its shares are unsurprisingly being sold off in the wake of the crisis in Turkey. \u201cThe recent collapse in the Turkish lira has served to trouble investors around the world and triggered a \u2018risk-off\u2019 mentality. Put simply, investors are less willing to hold assets in higher risk areas such as emerging markets, and are switching instead to assets deemed to be safer havens. Fiona Cinoctta, senior market analyst at City Index, reckons the Turkish government only has a few days to stem the crisis. She warns that the slump in the lira could prompt some companies to default on their US dollar loans, triggering a domino effect: The lira had already declined 20% against the dollar on Friday on a mixture of domestic financial problems and increasing friction with the US and the decline continued this morning with the Turkish currency plumbing new lows. For the time being Turkey\u2019s financial crisis looks localised but the country\u2019s central bank has perhaps only days to stop the decline of the currency before the lira\u2019s freefall results in loan defaults, starts seriously affecting the country\u2019s financial system and potentially starts spilling over onto European banks. Into this domestically induced financial slide comes the deteriorating relationship between Turkey and the US. The US is holding it against Turkey that it is refusing to support US sanctions against Iran and that is not releasing an American pastor who is being held on terrorism charges. The US response was fairly clear cut \u2013 on Friday when the lira was in freefall the US announced it would raise the tariffs on imports of Turkish steel to 50% and the tariffs take effect Monday morning. The selloff at the Istanbul stock market is gathering pace. The BIST 100 index has fallen 4%, with some bank stocks suffering double-digit losses. You can get up to speed on the Turkey crisis with this Q&amp;A: Plus, here\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott on why Turkey needs to raise interest rates sharply, or turn to the IMF for help.... Erdo\u011fan\u2019s answer to the financial crisis \u2013 that his followers should do their patriotic duty and exchange rapidly appreciating US dollars for ever-more worthless Turkish lira \u2013 is laughable. Indeed, it will merely add to the belief in the world\u2019s financial markets that Turkey is being led by a man who has lost touch with reality. It is clear what needs to happen. Turkey has to tackle the three causes of its current predicament: an overheating economy; Erdo\u011fan\u2019s attempts since his re-election in June to prevent the central bank from taking the necessary action to deal with rising prices; and the stand-off with the US. For Erdo\u011fan, that means eating a huge plateful of humble pie. He is going to have to surrender to Trump over [jailed pastor Andrew] Brunson, because he is damaging the economy by continuing with a fight he cannot win. And he will need to accept that tough and unpopular measures are now inevitable to prevent a total collapse in the currency leading to hyper-inflation. The slump in the Turkish lira in recent weeks is quite extraordinary. It has lost a third of its value against the US dollar in a week (!) as investors have grown more anxious about the country\u2019s financial health, its diplomatic row with the US, and its central bank\u2019s reluctance (or inability) to raise borrowing costs to stem the crisis. This chart shows how the crisis could spread to Europe, if Turkish banks find themselves struggling to repay dollar-denominated debts: Turkish authorities have launched a crackdown on news and social media posts which are threatening confidence in the economy, according to local reports. Turkish financial regulators are threatening legal action against those who make or publish \u201cerroneous and fabricated news and statements\u201d. Almost 350 social media accounts are under investigation, for undermining the lira\u2019s exchange rate against the US dollar. The move comes as president Erdo\u011fan\u2019s office warns that there is a co-ordinated attempt to undermine the country\u2019s economy. H\u00fcrriyet Daily News has the details: The Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Istanbul has opened an investigation into actions threatening \u201ceconomic security,\u201d while Turkey\u2019s financial watchdog launched a separate probe into what it described as \u201cfake news\u201d aiming to manipulate economy. \u201cAn investigation has been launched according to Turkish Penal Law, Banking Law, Capital Markets Board regulations and related laws into people who displayed actions that threaten economic security through manipulative stories on media and operational social media accounts as part of the economic attacks that target the Republic of Turkey, its social peace, unity and economic security by the powers behind the [2016] coup attempt,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement on August 13, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. In a separate statement, Turkey\u2019s Interior Ministry said that \u201ca judicial investigation has been launched into 346 social media accounts who shared posts to provoke the rise in the dollar exchange rate.\u201d Meanwhile, Turkey\u2019s Financial Crime Investigation Board (MASAK) also launched a probe into what it described as \u201cfake news\u201d aiming to manipulate economy. \u201cMASAK started an investigation into people and institutions that spread fake news, such as those claiming that \u2018the state will intervene to convert foreign exchange in accounts into Turkish lira\u2019 and \u2018it will fix dollar exchange rate\u2019 by ditching floating rate policy, which is a main pillar of the free market,\u201d Treasure and Finance Ministry Press Undersecretary Ali Berber said in a tweet on Aug. 13. More here: Turkey launches probe into \u2018fake news\u2019 over lira rumors Overnight, the president\u2019s communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, has claimed there is a \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d underway to undermine confidence in Turkey\u2019s financial sector. He is unhappy about reports that President Erdo\u011fan is threatening to seize foreign currency deposits. Over the weekend, Erdo\u011fan warned he would take new measures if businesses rushed to withdraw their bank funds. He told an audience in Trabzon that: \u201cIt is industrialists\u2019 duty too to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise we will set into motion our plan B and C.\u201d Altun insist on Twitter, though, that this has been misinterpreted (although he doesn\u2019t reveal what Plans B or C might be): Emerging currencies across the globe are suffering from the Turkish crisis. The South African rand has dropped to a two-year low, while Russia\u2019s rouble is at its lowest against the US dollar since early 2016. India\u2019s rupee hit a record low, with traders reporting that the country\u2019s central bank had intervened to prevent an even steeper loss. The Turkish lira is still sharply lower today, down 6% at 6.8 lira to the US dollar (having plunged through 7 lira in early trading). With the US dollar strengthening, traders fear that developing economies are going to suffer capital outflows - potentially creating fresh currency crises. Neil Wilson of Markets.com fears further pain for emerging markets [EM in City jargon]. The dollar is the big winner in all this as investors turn away from EM. This may very well make things worse, particularly as long-dollar increasingly becomes something of a one-way trade. This dollar rally has a lot further to go and this will heap more misery on EM. European bank shares are leading the selloff, driven by fears that they could be dragged into the Turkish crisis. Several European financial institution, including Spain\u2019s BBVA, Italy\u2019s UniCredit and France\u2019s BNP Paribas, have significant operations in Turkey. They have borrowed in US dollars and may struggle to repay those debts unless the lira recovers. BBVA shares have fallen by 2.2%, Unicredit have lost 2% and BNP Paribas are down 1%. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that the European Central Bank is concerned about their exposure to the Turkish crisis. Anxiety about spillover effects from Turkey is also pinning the euro at a one-year low against the US dollar (down half a cent at $1.137 right now). Yesterday, Turkish finance minister Berat Albayrak pledged that a new economic action plan would be implemented today. He announced: \u201cFrom Monday morning onwards our institutions will take the necessary steps and will share the announcements with the market.\u201d But that promise, and the Turkish central bank\u2019s new measures, don\u2019t appear to be stemming the crisis. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at financial services group ADSS, says Turkish policymakers need to do more: Erdogan\u2019s speeches over the weekend did little to calm down investors as he remains defiant and this morning news that the Turkish central bank implemented measures to improve liquidity is not addressing the main issue which is the lira\u2019s decline. Ergodan\u2019s unwillingness to raise interest rates suggests that the situation might not be defused soon extending the risk-off sentiment seen across all markets. Anxiety over Turkey is hitting share prices across Europe too, following those losses in Asia earlier today. The main European indices have all fallen into the red in early trading. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 0.8%, and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 0.45% or 35 points at 7631. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says contagion fears are engulfing the markets. The panic that engulfed the markets at the end of last week is showing no signs of going anywhere at the start of the new week. Traders were met with a sea of red as indices dived across the Asian session; investors shunned riskier assets overnight while safer havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss Franc firmed; jitters surrounding the Turkish currency crisis were showing few signs of moving on. The Turkish Lira dropped a further 6.3% in trading overnight, breaking through TL7 and hitting an all time low of TL7.2 after comments from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the weekend failed to calm investors. The lack of any new significant policy and a defiant stance from Erdogan means that traders are bracing themselves for another day of hectic trading on Monday. Turkey\u2019s stock market is suffering heavy losses this morning. The BIST 30 index of Turkey\u2019s top countries has slumped by 2.5% in early trading, with virtually every share down. Financial stocks, utilities and consumer-focused companies are all leading the selloff, as investors fear that the financial crisis is escalating. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at foreign exchange firm FXTM, argues that Turkish policymakers need take much more decisive action, immediately. With inflation expected to run above 20%, a current account deficit that continues to widen, bond yields trading at record highs and growing political tensions with the U.S., the Turkish administration have limited choices to stop the Lira from bleeding. Investors need to see serious economic measures and not political ones to prevent things getting completely out of control. This includes an emergency interest rate hike by the central bank, imposing capital controls, fiscal reforms, securing a rescue package by the IMF or other lenders and ending the current diplomatic fight with Donald Trump. Until such steps are taken, investors will continue to selloff Turkish assets. Turkey\u2019s central bank has taken action to stem the crisis, after seeing the lira slump to a record low today. The central bank of Turkey has announced several measures to \u201csupport financial stability and sustain the effective functioning of markets\u201d. This includes providing \u201call the liquidity the banks need\u201d, and taking a more active role in the foreign exchange markets. In a statement (online here), the bank says: The Central Bank will closely monitor the market depth and price formations, and take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability, if deemed necessary. It\u2019s an attempt to stabilize the tumbling lira and improve liquidity in the banking system. The move is having some success - the lira has recovered to around 6.7 against the dollar, from this morning\u2019s record low of 7.2. But, that still means it has suffered a huge depreciation in the last week: Crucially, the bank has NOT raised interest rates, despite some economists arguing they need to increase by perhaps 10 percentage points. Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at Swedish bank SEB, thinks more needs to be done: Asian stock markets and emerging currencies have been hit by the Turkish crisis today, and the euro has been dragged down to its lowest level in a year. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: The Turkish lira fell almost 9% in early trading on Monday and the euro hit a one-year low as investors feared that the country\u2019s financial crisis could spread to European markets. Despite defiant words by the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan over the weekend pledging as yet unspecified action to reverse the slide, the currency slipped alarmingly against the US dollar on Monday. Asian stock markets were also down on Monday. The Nikkei in Japan lost 1.7%, Hong Kong was off 1.8%, Shanghai -1.7%, Sydney -0.5% and the Taiwanese bourse fell 3%. The euro dropped 0.3% to a one-year low against the US dollar on Monday as the falling lira fuelled demand for safe havens, including the greenback, Swiss franc and yen. The Vix volatility index measuring turbulence in financial markets \u2013 also known as the fear index \u2013 jumped 16% on Monday. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fear is sweeping through the financial markets this morning as Turkey falls deeper into a currency crisis. The Turkish lira has slumped to new record lows overnight, hitting more than 7 lira to the US dollar. That followed Friday\u2019s precipitous declines, as investors fear that the country could be heading towards full-blown financial chaos. The crisis has been building for months as Turkey\u2019s inflation rate has surged higher, its current account deficit has risen, and its economy has been hurt by the strengthening US dollar. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s increasing autocratic governing stance - including putting his son-in-law into a key post running the economy - has spooked the markets. So has his dislike of higher interest rates, which would typically be used to prop up a weakening currency like the lira. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to double Turkey\u2019s steel and aluminium tariffs on Friday has added to the sense of panic. President Erdo\u011fan did nothing to reassure investors over the weekend. Instead, in a series of public addresses, he blasted the United States over the dispute over a jailed US pastor, and appeared to hint that Turkey \u2013 a Nato member \u2013 might look elsewhere for help (Russia, perhaps?) He declared: \u201cWe will say bye bye to those, who sacrifice their strategic partnership and alliance with a country of 81 million people on the altar of their relations with terror organisations. \u201cWe are working day and night for alternative markets.\u201d Erdo\u011fan also urged the Turkish people to do their bit, by converting any spare dollar and euros into lira. He told supporters in the north-eastern Turkish town of \u00dcnye that: \u201cIf there are dollars under your pillow, take these out. \u201cIf there are euros, take these out \u2026 immediately give these to the banks and convert to Turkish lira and, by doing this, we fight this war of independence and the future. Because this is the language they understand.\u201d Unless Turkish policymakers can get a grip, the situation could easily cause serious problems in other markets. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The Turkish lira has taken a battering, and the banks in Turkey who have borrowed in euros might struggle to repay their loans if they haven\u2019t hedged their position. Some eurozone banks have substantial shareholdings in Turkish bank, and should the default rate rise in Turkey, it could have a knock on effect around Europe. It looks like the eurozone banking system is set for another period of turmoil as the exposure that some Spanish and French banks have to Turkey could hurt confidence in the region. European banks have enough to worry about with their own non-performing loans, and let alone Turkey\u2019s weakened loan books. When it comes to the health of banks, traders usually steer clear of stocks and seek out safe-haven assets such as government bonds or the Japanese yen.

Here\u2019s a flavour:</p> <h2>What are the implications for the global economy?</h2> <p>The direct impact of what looks like an inevitable recession in Turkey would be relatively small because, despite a population of 80 million and strong growth in recent years, the country accounts for only 1% of global GDP. Eurozone countries run a trade surplus with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a> but it is small. In the two previous Turkish financial crises since the turn of the millennium, European exporters have been able to divert their business to other markets. The European Central Bank has expressed concern about potential contagion through the eurozone banking system, with Spain, followed by Italy, the most heavily exposed countries.<br></p> <p>A bigger danger is that Turkey\u2019s crisis will spill over into other emerging market economies and there were signs on Monday that other countries seen as vulnerable were coming under speculative attack. Turkey\u2019s problems are particularly acute because it has more than $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt, which is getting more expensive to finance by the day. However, other countries \u2013 such as Mexico and South Africa - also took advantage of low US interest rates in the years after the financial crisis to borrow heavily in dollars and saw their currencies coming under pressure. The fear is of a full-blown emerging market crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/13/how-serious-is-turkeys-lira-crisis-and-what-are-the-implications\">How serious is Turkey's lira crisis and what are the implications?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b71adabe4b0cc3a88371818\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-13T16:16:06.993Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The lira is weakening in late trading, and is threatening to plunge back the 7 lira-to-the-US dollar mark to a new all-time low.</strong></p> <p>Andy Birch, principal economist at IHS Markit, fears the lira will keep tumbling until Turkey raises interest rates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The changes to reserve requirements in recent days and the government\u2019s unspecified action plan has done little to stabilize the lira.

      "bodyText": "A fresh plunge in the Turkish lira sent tremors through global currency markets on Monday, amid fears that the failure of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government to tackle its worsening financial crisis would have a domino effect on other vulnerable countries. Argentina\u2019s central bank raised its key interest rate by five percentage points to 45% after a fall in the peso and the South African rand was also hit in a day of turbulence that saw the lira fall 8% against the dollar. Erdo\u011fan lashed out at \u201ceconomic terrorists on social media\u201d as he accused Donald Trump of stabbing Turkey in the back. But the Turkish president\u2019s insistence that his country would survive an economic siege failed to reassure financial markets alarmed at the possible collapse of the strategically vital emerging market country. Concerns that the 45% drop in the value of the lira this year would prove ruinous for companies that had borrowed heavily in foreign currencies prompted the renewed sell off of the lira and pushed up the cost of servicing Turkey\u2019s budget deficit. Erdo\u011fan insisted that the Turkish economy was fundamentally sound and attacked the US president for imposing sanctions and doubling tariffs on Turkey\u2019s steel and aluminium imports last week over the house arrest of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, on disputed terrorism charges. \u201cWe are together in Nato and then you stab your strategic partner in the back,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said as he came under pressure from the markets to respond to the lira\u2019s fall and an inflation rate of more than 15%. Speaking at a gathering of Turkish ambassadors in Ankara, Erdo\u011fan offered no hint that he would release Brunson and has so far made no application to the International Monetary Fund for emergency financial help. The lira would soon settle \u201cat the most reasonable level\u201d, he said. Reto Foellmi, economist from the University of St Gallen in Switzerland, said: \u201cAs the lira has a reputation as a weak currency, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rhetoric puts oil into the fire. With a further weakening of the lira, Turkey faces a downward spiral, where default could be the end.\u201d Although Turkey\u2019s $300bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt makes it particularly vulnerable, currency speculators have started to assess the potential damage to Europe and to identify other emerging market countries that have also taken advantage of low global interest rates to accumulate foreign currency debts during the post-financial crisis period. Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, voiced growing concern in European capitals that Turkey\u2019s problems could spill over into the European Union, either through losses to Spanish and Italian banks exposed to bad loans or from a politically-unpopular rise in migration. Merkel called on Erdo\u011fan to drop his opposition to higher interest rates, thereby allowing the central bank in Ankara to raise official borrowing costs from their current level of 17.75%. \u201cNobody has an interest in an economic destabilisation in Turkey. But everything must be done to ensure an independent central bank,\u201d Merkel said as the euro hit a 13-month low on currency markets. In the absence of higher interest rates or capital controls to defend the currency, the lira was trading at around 7.0 to the dollar in late trading on Monday. The announcement by Turkey\u2019s central bank that it was easing financing conditions for banks failed to halt a decline that has seen the lira lose 20% of its value against the dollar so far this month. Analysts warned that the contagion from Turkey would increase the longer it took Ankara to respond decisively to the crisis. Agathe Demarais, lead Turkey analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cWith an overheated and indebted economy, Turkey will require credibly orthodox economic policies, fiscal discipline and central bank independence to reverse the current situation. \u201cA normalisation of relations with the US could also reduce the amount of legwork that the central bank will have to do to control the economic situation, but this is unlikely to happen at the moment. In view of the domestic political and economic conditions, it is therefore unclear whether the necessary steps will be taken to contain the market fallout.\u201d Argentina\u2019s central bank raised its key interest rate from 40% to 45% as the peso hit a record low, the rand was at its weakest in two years, and there was also downward pressure on the Indian rupee and the Indonesian rupiah. In the City, UK companies exposed to Turkey saw their share prices fall. Travel firm TUI was the biggest loser in the FTSE 100, despite the fall in the lira against the pound making Turkish holidays cheaper. European banking stocks fell 1%, reflecting investor that some EU-based banks could suffer significant losses on loans to Turkish businesses. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s anger at Trump has fuelled speculation that he might pull Turkey out of Nato and seek financial support from Russia and China rather than from the IMF. The Turkish president also spoke in Ankara of \u201ceconomic terrorists on social media,\u201d adding that the judiciary and financial authorities were taking action in response. \u201cThey are truly a network of treason,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make those spreading speculations pay the necessary price.\u201d Analysts warned that Turkey\u2019s response had been inadequate and that the lack of effective countermeasures heightened the risk of contagion. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at foreign exchange firm XTB, said: \u201cCalls from President Erdo\u011fan for citizens to abstain from exchanging their currency for foreign equivalents and a statement from the Turkish interior ministry that they will look to take action against bad-mouthing the economy on social media are clearly not going to be enough to spark a recovery, and the longer this goes on without concrete steps being taken towards an amicable solution, the greater the risk of contagion. \u201cOther emerging market currencies such as the South African rand, the Argentinian and Mexican pesos and the Russian rouble are all looking vulnerable to further declines, while a benchmark of global emerging stock markets has fallen near to its lowest level of the year.\u201d Alastair George, chief investment strategist at Edison Investment Research, said: \u201cWhile deft diplomacy cannot at this stage be ruled out to defuse the crisis, the US and Turkey remain on a collision course at present. Erdo\u011fan is keen to play the possibility of support from other allies \u2013 perhaps Russia, China and Iran. \u201cThis is therefore more than a domestic economic or political crisis but potentially a key geopolitical turning point in respect of Nato and Turkey\u2019s relationship with the EU.\u201d This article was amended on 14 August 2014 because an earlier version erroneously referred to \u201cthe Indonesian ringgit\u201d.

Then the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, repeated his angry analysis of who was to blame.

Meanwhile, any notion of summoning the IMF, and thereby awakening memories of past Turkish crises, remains politically unpalatable. The net result was a further 8% slide in a currency that has lost roughly half its value against the dollar this year.

The trouble is, Turkey\u2019s crisis is happening now, whereas any loans from Russia or China \u2013 who, in any case, have reasons not to inflame their own quarrels with the US \u2013 would arrive only slowly. One still has to assume that, one way or another, the IMF will eventually become involved, just as it did in Argentina in June. Quite how Erdo\u011fan can credibly shift to such a position is anybody\u2019s guess but it is the logical endgame. The only vaguely good news is that the contagion warnings are not flashing red. A few European banks are overexposed, but the lending problem is not system-wide. In a bigger crisis, investors would also be selling the currencies of other weak emerging economies. The South African rand is sliding but one cannot \u2013 yet \u2013 call it across-the-board panic. That may come, however.

Clarity needed at Esure \u201cEsure is a great business today and I am excited about the many opportunities we have to ensure we continue to be a great business in the future,\u201d the founder, chairman and 30% owner, Sir Peter Wood, said in March. Has his enthusiasm waned? Five months later, Woods and Esure are \u201cminded to recommend\u201d a 280p-a-share, or \u00a31.2bn, takeover approach from the private equity outfit Bain Capital. The proposed price doesn\u2019t look terrific since Esure was valued at slightly more only 12 months ago. But it is a 37% premium to the share price last week, which is a level at which boards tend to roll over. To those shareholders who grumble that Esure floated at 290p in 2013, the directors will be able to point to the \u00a3300m of dividends paid since and the demerger of the price comparison website Go Compare. But investors will want clarity on a more important point. Bain, you would think, would want to keep Wood in harness in some role. After all, he founded Esure in 2000 and is the guru of general insurance, having also launched Direct Line in the 1980s. Would Wood sell all his shares to Bain? Or would he remain a player with a stake? If it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s a significant point. Speak up \u2013 starting with Tuesday\u2019s half-year results.

Sorry, but this doesn\u2019t wash. There is a huge difference between the expression of an interest in a buyout and the completion of the legal paperwork and due diligence to make the deal happen.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Annual data from the bureau of statistics on the labour force shows that more than one million workers last year changed jobs, with many changing occupations and industries. It also shows that the level of workers who are satisfied with the number of hours they are working each week is continuing its 45 year downward trend. One of the commonly forgotten aspects when we look at the monthly employment figures is that not all new employment is to a person who was previously unemployed or out of the workforce. Each month a significant number of people change jobs. In the 12 months to February 2018, more than a million workers changed jobs. But while that number appears massive, somewhat contrary to the narrative that people are more likely to work numerous jobs than in the past, the data suggest that people are now more likely to be sticking with the same employer. Just 8.1% of the 12 and half million employees changed jobs in the past year \u2013 well down on the record 19.5% in 1989. Over two thirds of those who changed jobs did so to change the number of hours \u2013 although only around a third changed from part-time to full-time or vice-versa. And more than half not only changed industries but also their occupation: The experience of searching for more hours is something that workers are very much aware of \u2013 and definitely more so than in the past. What this annual data highlights is the great change in the basis of work since the 1960s. In 1962 almost all workers \u2013 whether working full-time or part-time \u2013 were happy with their hours. From the early 1970s through to the end of the 1980s this level of satisfied workers trended down \u2013 both due to economic downturns throughout much of the 1970s and the early 1980s recession, and the influx of women workers into the labour force. The 1990 recession saw a major fall in the number of satisfied workers, and while the period of strong economic growth in the 1990s and early 2000s saw the level improve, it has never returned to the pre-1990 levels. But then once the GFC hit the level of satisfied workers again fell \u2013 to be now at a near record low, having improved slightly from the low point in 2017: The figures show that men are generally more satisfied with their hours than are women \u2013 but that both genders are less satisfied than in the past: But the data also suggests that a major part of the decrease in satisfaction and the subsequent increase in underemployment is due mostly to the increase in overall part-time work by both genders. In 2018, underemployed part-time workers accounted for just under 9% of all workers, which was well above the 6.6% level of 1993. But 1993 was the year that recorded the highest ever level of part-time workers who were underemployed. In that year 28.1% of part-time workers wanted more hours, compared to 26.4% in 2018: It highlights the difficulty with tackling underemployment \u2013 it is not that part-time workers are suddenly wanting more hours than in the past, it is that part-time workers make up a larger share of workers than in the recent past. The percentage of both men and women part-time workers who are underemployed is actually little changed from 2009 despite during that time underemployment levels overall have risen: Interestingly men part-time workers are more likely to be after more hours than women, and men are also more likely to want to move into full-time employment than are women: The annual data also gives some insight into the numbers of people who are marginally attached to the workforce \u2013 those who are not technically unemployed because they are not actively looking for work. There is a suggestion by some that not including such people in the labour force figures hides the true level of unemployment. But what the data shows is that the percentage of such people has not changed significantly at all in recent years and is, if anything, lower than in the past. Including such people in the total of the unemployed would certainly increase the unemployment rate (up to around 12%) but it would not suggest any difference in the change over the past decade: And while it is important to track the level of disaffected job searchers, mostly this can be done through changes in the participation rate. Certainly the search for work can be so difficult as to drive people to give up. The data however suggests that people have slightly less difficulty now than in the past: For most job seekers the biggest change since the GFC has been the increase in competition for each job \u2013 17% said in 2018 that was the main difficulty in finding work, compared to just 8% in 2008: The annual data of labour force participation gives us a chance to take a long-term view of how the economy has changed for workers. It presents a picture that shows that the solutions to issues of underemployment are rather complex. While the level of underemployment has grown, the data shows that part-time workers overall are not becoming more eager to work more hours, just that there are more part-time workers now than in the past This presents challenges for policy makers seeking to reduce underemployment as it requires tackling large scale changes in the economy rather than hoping to see employers of part-time workers increase their hours, through better economic growth (or lower company tax). It will require arresting the major shift of the past 45 years of work going from full-time to the more flexible but less satisfying part-time. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

In that year 28.1% of part-time workers wanted more hours, compared to 26.4% in 2018:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underemployed part-time workers\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oOCfi/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It highlights the difficulty with tackling underemployment \u2013 it is not that part-time workers are suddenly wanting more hours than in the past, it is that part-time workers make up a larger share of workers than in the recent past. </p> <p>The percentage of both men and women part-time workers who are underemployed is actually little changed from 2009 despite during that time underemployment levels overall have risen:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percent of part-time workers who are underemployed\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8cRZL/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Interestingly men part-time workers are more likely to be after more hours than women, and men are also more likely to want to move into full-time employment than are women:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percent of underemployed seeking full-time work\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/T7O57/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The annual data also gives some insight into the numbers of people who are marginally attached to the workforce \u2013 those who are not technically unemployed because they are not actively looking for work. </p> <p>There is a suggestion by some that not including such people in the labour force figures hides the true level of unemployment. But what the data shows is that the percentage of such people has not changed significantly at all in recent years and is, if anything, lower than in the past. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of the population with marginal attachment to the workforce\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UoyRe/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Including such people in the total of the unemployed would certainly increase the unemployment rate (up to around 12%) but it would not suggest any difference in the change over the past decade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployment rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OqPyk/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And while it is important to track the level of disaffected job searchers, mostly this can be done through changes in the participation rate. Certainly the search for work can be so difficult as to drive people to give up.

    "webTitle": "Blow for coal power as EU carbon emissions price hits 10-year high", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The amount polluters pay for emitting carbon in the EU has hit a 10-year high, in a blow for coal power station owners and a boost for renewable energy. The price of carbon in the bloc\u2019s emissions trading scheme reached \u20ac18 (\u00a316) per tonne on Monday, triple the level a year ago. About 12,000 factories and power stations have to pay for every tonne of carbon they emit under the scheme, but for years an oversupply of permits has meant the cost has languished at about \u20ac5 per tonne. That is too low to spur companies to lower emissions. However, observers said the carbon price rises and further anticipated increases would begin to hurt coal operators\u2019 profit margins and influence investment decisions. Phil MacDonald, the head of communications at Sandbag, a group that monitors the carbon market, said: \u201cIt will already be cutting into coal profits \u2026 Renewables get a big win from this and so does nuclear.\u201d Mark Lewis, the head of research at the Carbon Tracker thinktank, said although coal plant owners were bearing the brunt of the higher carbon price, they would pass it straight through to consumers. The price of carbon would need to go much higher, to as much as \u20ac30 (\u00a327) per tonne, to trigger large-scale switches from coal to gas and renewables, he argued. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are at the stage yet where the carbon price will have a major effect.\u201d Sandrine Ferrand, a market analyst at Engie Global Markets, said the extra cost would be significant for coal, at about \u20ac11-12 extra per megawatt hour. But the incentive to switch fuels would be limited because gas prices had also increased, alongside oil prices. \u201cSo far, the carbon price is not high enough to trigger a large switch from coal-fired power generation to less polluting gas-fired power generation,\u201d she said. Coal companies are also insulated temporarily as they hedge when buying carbon permits and have benefited from recent increases in wholesale power prices. The dramatic increase in the carbon price has been driven up partly by European commission reforms to cut the supply of carbon permits from January. The heatwave affecting large parts of Europe this summer is also seen as having a bullish effect. The hot weather bolstered fossil fuel burning as people turned to fans and air conditioning to keep cool, while generation from hydro and windfarms has been down because of low river levels and wind speeds. Continued growth in the carbon price would strengthen progressive members of Germany\u2019s newly formed \u201ccoal exit commission\u201d, which is due to issue a plan this year. One wild card is Brexit and whether the UK quits the carbon market if and when it leaves the EU. Chris Piabiatek, a carbon trader at Vertis Environmental Finance, which expects a tonne of carbon to cost just under \u20ac19 next year, said a no-deal Brexit that involves the UK crashing out of the carbon market would be \u201csuper bearish\u201d for carbon prices.",

    "webTitle": "Defence firm Chemring issues profit warning after fatal explosion", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in Chemring plunged after a fatal explosion at its Salisbury factory forced the defence company to halt production there and issue a profit warning. The explosion and fire on Friday afternoon at its facility near Salisbury in Wiltshire killed one employee and badly injured another. Parts of the factory, which employs more than 400 people and makes products to protect military ships and aircraft from missiles, were damaged. Production at the site has been suspended while the company carries out an investigation with the authorities into the cause of the blast. Chemring expects underlying operating profit for the 12 months to 31 October to be \u00a310m to \u00a320m lower than the previous forecast of \u00a355m. It said it was unable to quantify accurately the impact of the explosion on 2018 and 2019, as it depends on money recovered from its insurer, when the site reopens and at what rate production resumes. Last year the firm made an underlying operating profit of \u00a355.4m, while pretax profits were down 50% to \u00a34m after accounting for one-off items, including restructuring costs. Sanjay Jha, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the timing of the blast \u201ccould not be worse\u201d. Chemring tests its products during the dry summer months in the UK and US, and makes and sells them between August and October, its fourth quarter.

      "bodyText": "When Dollar General came to Haven, Kansas, it arrived making demands. The fastest-growing retailer in America wanted the taxpayers of the small, struggling Kansas town to pick up part of the tab for building one of its squat, barebones stores that more often resemble a warehouse than a neighbourhood shop. Dollar General thought Haven\u2019s council should give the company a $72,000 break on its utility bills, equivalent to the cost of running the town\u2019s library and swimming pool for a year, on the promise of jobs and tax revenues. The council blanched but ended up offering half of that amount to bring the low-price outlet to a town that already had a grocery store. \u201cDollar General are a force. It\u2019s hard to stop a train,\u201d said Mike Alfers, Haven\u2019s then mayor who backed the move. \u201cObviously there\u2019s been collateral damage. We didn\u2019t expect it. I\u2019m torn but, net-net, I still think it was a good move to bring them in.\u201d The Dollar General opened in Haven at the end of February 2015. Three years later, the company applied to build a similar store in the neighbouring town of Buhler, a 20-minute drive along a ramrod straight road north through sprawling Kansas farmland. Buhler\u2019s mayor, Daniel Friesen, watched events unfold in Haven and came to see Dollar General not so much as an opportunity as a diagnosis. Friesen understood why dying towns with no shops beyond the convenience store at the gas station welcomed Dollar General out of desperation for anything at all, like Burton, just up the road, where the last food shop closed 20 years ago. But Buhler had a high street with grocery and hardware stores, a busy cafe and a clothes shop. It had life. As Friesen saw it, Dollar General was not only a threat to all that but amounted to admission his town was failing. \u201cIt was about retaining the soul of the community. It was about, what kind of town do we want?\u201d he said. Dollar General is opening stores at the rate of three a day across the US. It moves into places not even Walmart will go, targeting rural towns and damaged inner-city neighbourhoods with basic goods at basic prices \u2013 a strategy described by a former chief executive of the chain as \u201cwe went where they ain\u2019t\u201d. The chain now has more outlets across the country than McDonald\u2019s has restaurants, and its profits have surged past some of the grand old names of American retail. The company estimates that three-quarters of the population lives within five miles of one of its stores, which stock everything from groceries and household cleaners to clothes and tools. Not everything is to be had for a dollar, but rarely is anything priced above $10. But there is a cost. Dollar General\u2019s aggressive pricing drives locally owned grocery stores out of business, replacing shelves stocked with fresh fruit, vegetables and meat with the kinds of processed foods underpinning the country\u2019s obesity and diabetes crisis. Dollar Generals are frequently found at the heart of \u201cfood deserts\u201d, defined by the department of agriculture as a rural community where one-third of residents live more than 10 miles from a grocery store selling fresh produce. That was not what bothered Friesen. He saw construction of a Dollar General more as a statement about the health of his town as a whole than any one of its 1,400 residents. If Dollar General were to be believed, there was a sound economic benefit for Buhler from one of its stores. This time the company didn\u2019t ask the council for money. Instead it sold the promise of prosperity, claiming it would boost the town\u2019s coffers with increased sales tax revenues by encouraging residents to shop locally instead of traveling to distant supermarkets for what they cannot find at the grocery store. Buhler\u2019s council called two public meetings in March to gauge the mood of residents and invited Doug Nech, owner of neighbouring Haven\u2019s only grocery store, the Foodliner, to speak. Dollar General had driven his shop out of business days earlier. \u201cWe lasted three years and three days after Dollar General opened,\u201d he said. \u201cSales dropped and just kept dropping. We averaged 225 customers a day before and immediately dropped to about 175. A year ago we were down to 125 a day. Basically we lost 35 to 40% of our sales. I lost a thousand dollars a day in sales in three years.\u201d The arrival of Dollar General cost the Foodliner hundreds of thousands of dollars over that time. The foremost challenge was price. The chain has the power of scale in negotiating with foodmakers. Nech discovered the store had done a deal with Campbell\u2019s Soup to make a 14.5oz can of chicken noodle soup for $1.50, the price he was paying wholesale for an 11oz can of the same soup. \u201cDollar General have buying power. There\u2019s not a lot of competition at the wholesale level so it\u2019s rather difficult and the smaller you are, you pay a higher price for goods whether it\u2019s in delivery costs or volume buying or any number of things,\u201d he said. Nech calls Dollar General \u201ca cancer\u201d but reserves his anger for Haven\u2019s council for subsidising a hugely profitable corporation to compete against him. He asked the council to cut his shop\u2019s utility bill to $100 a month until the Foodliner received a matching benefit. It refused, saying that Dollar General had taken advantage of a programme to bring in new business while Nech\u2019s was long established. \u201cIt\u2019s the principle that they gave them money to come to town. I\u2019m kind of conservative. I don\u2019t believe in asking government for anything and I damn sure don\u2019t believe in asking the government for anything now,\u201d he said. Friesen said Nech\u2019s account \u201cscared a lot of people\u201d in Buhler who feared they could lose their own grocery store. The council also took on board what happened in a town an hour north-east of Buhler when a small Walmart moved in, put two grocery stores out of business and then shut down, leaving the town with nothing. \u201cDollar General, Walmart, any large corporation, doesn\u2019t have the best interests of our community at heart here at all,\u201d said the mayor. Buhler\u2019s council was not reassured by Dollar General\u2019s attempts to say that it should not even discuss the store and its potential impact at the planning meetings. The company submitted its application through the developer assigned to build the outlet. The developer sought a change of use for the land from agricultural to retail without specifying what kind of shop it planned to construct. Friesen said Dollar General did not want its name brought up during the council\u2019s deliberations. \u201cDollar General were saying this wasn\u2019t an application for a Dollar General, it was an application for a retail store. It could be anything. It could be a clothing store. They didn\u2019t want us to consider some significant issues such as local economic impact,\u201d he said. The council asked an expert on the impact of cut-price stores from Kansas State University to address the public meeting. David Procter laid out the ways independently owned family businesses generally benefit small communities. \u201cOn the average there are about 15 employees in these small grocery stores and Dollar General stores might have five employees. Profits from small-town grocery stores are generally going to stay in that town whereas profits made by Dollar General, a significant percentage of them anyway, are going to the corporate office in Tennessee,\u201d he said. Procter said many local grocery stores also serve as community gathering places, some of them with delis and seating areas where people have lunch, and offer services such as home delivery for the elderly or infirm. Dollar General, which tends to build spartan shops on the edge of towns to catch passing traffic on main roads, does none of these. \u201cGrocery stores give more back to the community. They are much more likely to support local sporting teams, local faith-based organisations. Dollar General corporate policy sets a pretty strict limit on how much community giving they provide,\u201d said Procter. Some at the public meeting spoke up in favour of the chain. They liked its long opening hours \u2013 most of Buhler\u2019s shops are closed on a Sunday \u2013 and cheaper prices. But the sentiment was overwhelmingly against the store and an informal online poll of the town\u2019s residents came out two to one in opposition. Some people didn\u2019t want an ugly building as the gateway to the town. A retirement community next to the planned site objected. In the end, people in Buhler decided that although the grocery and hardware stores might cost a little more they were prepared to pay a premium to preserve their community. Buhler has a large brown and yellow sign on the main road into town. It features a cross with an open book suggestive of a Bible. On one page is written \u201ctraditional values\u201d and on the other \u201cprogressive ideas\u201d. \u201cThere were some who said this is not very progressive to deny a new retail development in the community,\u201d said Friesen. \u201cBut there was agreement in the city council that the more progressive thing is to not do what every small community in Kansas seems like it\u2019s doing, just begging for a national retail chain to come in.\u201d Days after Nech was driven out of business in Haven, Buhler\u2019s council voted unanimously to reject Dollar General. The company\u2019s developer was not pleased. \u201cI wasn\u2019t terribly impressed. They stormed out. They were pretty hot about it,\u201d said Friesen. In Haven, the former mayor Mike Alfers conceded that the promised financial advantage of Dollar General has largely been lost with the closure of the Foodliner. It is now a fitness centre, with the old grocery store sign still hanging outside. Sales tax revenue for the town rose by more than $60,000 between the years before and after the Dollar General opened. But the Foodliner alone was collecting around $75,000 a year in sales tax which is now gone. On top of that, Nech paid an annual electricity bill of $37,000, which the city made money on, plus there was the break the council gave Dollar General on its utility bills. It remains to be seen how much business will transfer from the defunct grocery store to the Dollar General but the end result is the Haven\u2019s main street is finding it even more of a struggle to survive with the diminished flow of people to pick up groceries. For all that, while Alfers feels sympathy for Nech, he said the Dollar General is the future. \u201cThe Model-T put horses out of business. It\u2019s hard to protect existing businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cI would still vote for Dollar General. If one state didn\u2019t accept the Model-T it wouldn\u2019t have changed the outcome. I think Buhler voted their sentiment. The question is, in five years will they have a Dollar General or something similar?\u201d The owner of Buhler\u2019s grocery store, JC Keith, is acutely aware that seeing off Dollar General is not the only challenge. With decent paying jobs increasingly scarce in rural Kansas, a good part of the population of Buhler and Haven work in large towns with ready access to a range of rivals from Walmart to farmers markets. It\u2019s easier for residents of what have become bedroom communities to stop at a major store on the way home from work and only use the local grocery shop for last-minute supplies such as milk. \u201cA majority of people in Buhler that work, work somewhere else,\u201d said Keith, who is also a long-distance truck driver. \u201cChances are they drive right by some chain store on their way home.\u201d The threat from Dollar General prompted Keith to evaluate his way of doing business. He was already in the process of building a larger shop just down the road from the existing one, but now it will incorporate hot foods such as chicken and a salad bar. It will also open later. For all his support for building the Dollar General in Haven, Alfers rarely shops there and regrets the loss of the Foodliner. \u201cIt makes a lot of difference to me. I shopped a lot at Foodliner,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have a hard time time shopping at Dollar General. I like to cook. I like food items and spices you can\u2019t get at Dollar General. I\u2019m less loyal to any one store these days.\u201d Haven\u2019s residents now have to travel out of town to find fresh food, although many do that for work in any case. The more immediate impact has been on those who are less mobile, like the elderly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculates that about a quarter of the population is unable to buy healthy food nearby. Dollar Generals are frequently to be found in those areas and some studies have made a direct link between the rise of dollar stores and unhealthy eating. But it is not that straightforward. Megan Rinehart worked at Nech\u2019s Foodliner for six years. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a rich town. A lot of our customers bought not healthy stuff. They leaned towards what was fast and cheap. We had a pretty good selection of fresh produce. It was a matter of if they could afford it,\u201d she said. An agriculture department study found that many of those on low income and reliant on food stamps were more likely to decide where to shop based on price than where the nearest store is. They drive past a grocery store to a Dollar General. Alfers thinks Buhler will struggle to stave off the cut-price chain store because it is the future. Doug Nech is not so sure. He owned the Foodliner alongside a job travelling a dozen states as a church pew cushion salesman. Nech has seen the impact across the midwest of the store that put his own out of business. He views Dollar General as a juggernaut but that does not mean he thinks it\u2019s invincible. \u201cDollar General is building just as fast as it can. Nebraska. The Dakotas. You see it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut somewhere down the line, as these small towns dry up, business for Dollar General is going to dry up just like it does for a grocery store. If there\u2019s nobody new coming to town and your older population is dying off and they\u2019re not getting replaced very quickly, who are they going to sell to?\u201d",

There\u2019s not a lot of competition at the wholesale level so it\u2019s rather difficult and the smaller you are, you pay a higher price for goods whether it\u2019s in delivery costs or volume buying or any number of things,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nech calls Dollar General \u201ca cancer\u201d but reserves his anger for Haven\u2019s council for subsidising a hugely profitable corporation to compete against him. He asked the council to cut his shop\u2019s utility bill to $100 a month until the Foodliner received a matching benefit. It refused, saying that Dollar General had taken advantage of a programme to bring in new business while Nech\u2019s was long established.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the principle that they gave them money to come to town. I\u2019m kind of conservative. I don\u2019t believe in asking government for anything and I damn sure don\u2019t believe in asking the government for anything now,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6c5d9d4d6e600df071e26c882870a3fe0e4efb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6c5d9d4d6e600df071e26c882870a3fe0e4efb1/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Freiden in Buhler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Friesen in Buhler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kacy Meinecke for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Friesen said Nech\u2019s account \u201cscared a lot of people\u201d in Buhler who feared they could lose their own grocery store. The council also took on board what happened in a town an hour north-east of Buhler when a small Walmart moved in, put two grocery stores out of business and then shut down, leaving the town with nothing. \u201cDollar General, Walmart, any large corporation, doesn\u2019t have the best interests of our community at heart here at all,\u201d said the mayor.</p> <p>Buhler\u2019s council was not reassured by Dollar General\u2019s attempts to say that it should not even discuss the store and its potential impact at the planning meetings. The company submitted its application through the developer assigned to build the outlet. The developer sought a change of use for the land from agricultural to retail without specifying what kind of shop it planned to construct. Friesen said Dollar General did not want its name brought up during the council\u2019s deliberations.</p> <p>\u201cDollar General were saying this wasn\u2019t an application for a Dollar General, it was an application for a retail store. It could be anything. It could be a clothing store. They didn\u2019t want us to consider some significant issues such as local economic impact,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The council asked an expert on the impact of cut-price stores from Kansas State University to address the public meeting. David Procter laid out the ways independently owned family businesses generally benefit small communities. \u201cOn the average there are about 15 employees in these small grocery stores and Dollar General stores might have five employees. Profits from small-town grocery stores are generally going to stay in that town whereas profits made by Dollar General, a significant percentage of them anyway, are going to the corporate office in Tennessee,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Procter said many local grocery stores also serve as community gathering places, some of them with delis and seating areas where people have lunch, and offer services such as home delivery for the elderly or infirm. Dollar General, which tends to build spartan shops on the edge of towns to catch passing traffic on main roads, does none of these.</p> <p>\u201cGrocery stores give more back to the community. They are much more likely to support local sporting teams, local faith-based organisations. Dollar General corporate policy sets a pretty strict limit on how much community giving they provide,\u201d said Procter.</p> <p>Some at the public meeting spoke up in favour of the chain. They liked its long opening hours \u2013 most of Buhler\u2019s shops are closed on a Sunday \u2013 and cheaper prices. But the sentiment was overwhelmingly against the store and an informal online poll of the town\u2019s residents came out two to one in opposition. Some people didn\u2019t want an ugly building as the gateway to the town.</p> <p>A retirement community next to the planned site objected. In the end, people in Buhler decided that although the grocery and hardware stores might cost a little more they were prepared to pay a premium to preserve their community. Buhler has a large brown and yellow sign on the main road into town. It features a cross with an open book suggestive of a Bible. On one page is written \u201ctraditional values\u201d and on the other \u201cprogressive ideas\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere were some who said this is not very progressive to deny a new retail development in the community,\u201d said Friesen. \u201cBut there was agreement in the city council that the more progressive thing is to not do what every small community in Kansas seems like it\u2019s doing, just begging for a national retail chain to come in.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d80ceb697f43dd3c181538dd09ca391327b9a1f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d80ceb697f43dd3c181538dd09ca391327b9a1f4/0_15_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burrton, Kansas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burton, Kansas, where the last food shop closed 20 years ago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kacy Meinecke for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Days after Nech was driven out of business in Haven, Buhler\u2019s council voted unanimously to reject Dollar General. The company\u2019s developer was not pleased. \u201cI wasn\u2019t terribly impressed. They stormed out. They were pretty hot about it,\u201d said Friesen.</p> <p>In Haven, the former mayor Mike Alfers conceded that the promised financial advantage of Dollar General has largely been lost with the closure of the Foodliner. It is now a fitness centre, with the old grocery store sign still hanging outside. Sales tax revenue for the town rose by more than $60,000 between the years before and after the Dollar General opened. But the Foodliner alone was collecting around $75,000 a year in sales tax which is now gone.</p> <p>On top of that, Nech paid an annual electricity bill of $37,000, which the city made money on, plus there was the break the council gave Dollar General on its utility bills. It remains to be seen how much business will transfer from the defunct grocery store to the Dollar General but the end result is the Haven\u2019s main street is finding it even more of a struggle to survive with the diminished flow of people to pick up groceries.</p> <p>For all that, while Alfers feels sympathy for Nech, he said the Dollar General is the future. \u201cThe Model-T put horses out of business. It\u2019s hard to protect existing businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cI would still vote for Dollar General. If one state didn\u2019t accept the Model-T it wouldn\u2019t have changed the outcome. I think Buhler voted their sentiment. The question is, in five years will they have a Dollar General or something similar?\u201d</p> <p>The owner of Buhler\u2019s grocery store, JC Keith, is acutely aware that seeing off Dollar General is not the only challenge. With decent paying jobs increasingly scarce in rural Kansas, a good part of the population of Buhler and Haven work in large towns with ready access to a range of rivals from Walmart to farmers markets. It\u2019s easier for residents of what have become bedroom communities to stop at a major store on the way home from work and only use the local grocery shop for last-minute supplies such as milk.</p> <p>\u201cA majority of people in Buhler that work, work somewhere else,\u201d said Keith, who is also a long-distance truck driver. \u201cChances are they drive right by some chain store on their way home.\u201d</p> <p>The threat from Dollar General prompted Keith to evaluate his way of doing business. He was already in the process of building a larger shop just down the road from the existing one, but now it will incorporate hot foods such as chicken and a salad bar. It will also open later.</p> <p>For all his support for building the Dollar General in Haven, Alfers rarely shops there and regrets the loss of the Foodliner. \u201cIt makes a lot of difference to me. I shopped a lot at Foodliner,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have a hard time time shopping at Dollar General. I like to cook. I like food items and spices you can\u2019t get at Dollar General. I\u2019m less loyal to any one store these days.\u201d</p> <p>Haven\u2019s residents now have to travel out of town to find fresh food, although many do that for work in any case. The more immediate impact has been on those who are less mobile, like the elderly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculates that about a quarter of the population is unable to buy healthy food nearby. Dollar Generals are frequently to be found in those areas and some studies have made a direct link between the rise of dollar stores and unhealthy eating. But it is not that straightforward. Megan Rinehart worked at Nech\u2019s Foodliner for six years.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a rich town. A lot of our customers bought not healthy stuff. They leaned towards what was fast and cheap. We had a pretty good selection of fresh produce. It was a matter of if they could afford it,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/15/food-apartheid-food-deserts-racism-inequality-america-karen-washington-interview\">Food apartheid: the root of the problem with America's groceries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An agriculture department study found that many of those on low income and reliant on food stamps were <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2016/may/recent-evidence-on-the-effects-of-food-store-access-on-food-choice-and-diet-quality/\">more likely to decide</a> where to shop based on price than where the nearest store is. They drive past a grocery store to a Dollar General.</p> <p>Alfers thinks Buhler will struggle to stave off the cut-price chain store because it is the future. Doug Nech is not so sure. He owned the Foodliner alongside a job travelling a dozen states as a church pew cushion salesman. Nech has seen the impact across the midwest of the store that put his own out of business. He views Dollar General as a juggernaut but that does not mean he thinks it\u2019s invincible.</p> <p>\u201cDollar General is building just as fast as it can. Nebraska. The Dakotas.

      "bodyText": "As concerns over Donald Trump\u2019s import tariffs intensify and ministers renegotiate Britain\u2019s trading relationship with Europe, the postwar consensus towards ever-closer economic cooperation between wealthy nations is being unpicked. Why is trade good? Economists argue about a lot of things, yet many would probably agree on the benefits of free trade, which generates wealth by allowing the free flow of goods across international borders, without taxes and other such barriers. The argument runs that billions of people around the world have been lifted out of poverty by the combined power of capitalism and free trade. We are taught that the world\u2019s most powerful nations spurred their advance by tearing down the castle walls of protectionism during the latter half of the 19th century \u2013 ending centuries of beggar-thy-neighbour economic nationalism \u2013 opening up new markets to boost the industrial revolution and drive forward the development of the middle class. John Stuart Mill wrote that, once upon a time, the average patriot \u201cwished all countries weak, poor and ill-governed, but his own: he now sees in their wealth and progress a direct source of wealth and progress to his own country\u201d. Two ideas remain central to the theory of international trade more than 200 years later. In his seminal work The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith taught countries to concentrate their efforts on producing and selling goods in which they have an \u201cabsolute advantage\u201d over their trading partners. Cheaper labour costs give modern-day China an absolute advantage over most western nations for manufacturing. But what happens when a country has absolute advantage in multiple industries? In the 19th century, David Ricardo took the idea further by arguing that one country might have a comparative advantage over the other. He said it was possible for England to produce more wine and cloth than Portugal. However, it would require greater effort in England, handing Portugal a comparative advantage. Both theories teach nations to focus their time on making and selling goods in which they have an advantage over their rivals, for mutual benefit through free trade. Consumers will benefit from lower prices in both nations. Classical economic theory does not, however, always work in practice, and the rules require all nations to sing from the same hymn sheet. Unfettered capitalism across borders still creates winners and losers, posing thorny social and political questions for policymakers where dry economic models cannot help. There are thousands of ways nations can distort the playing field. The most extreme might be the use of military intervention, although far more common are subsidies for particular industries, tax, spending and the use of the legal system. Trump\u2019s import tariffs are the most high-profile example. How do import tariffs work? Tariffs are border taxes charged on foreign imports. Importers pay the charges at the point of entry to the customs agency of the country or economic bloc imposing them. Rather than being used to raise revenue, they are imposed to increase the price of foreign goods in order to make domestic produce comparatively cheaper, with the aim of encouraging domestic production and protecting firms from global competition. Economists mostly agree higher tariffs are counterproductive. While they can protect jobs, they also tend to raise the price of goods for consumers and stifle innovation that could benefit the economy. Countries signed up to the World Trade Organisation agree to keep their tariffs within certain limits. Acting as the ultimate arbiter in international tariff disputes, the club numbers about 160 nations including the UK, US, Japan and Germany, representing 96% of world trade. China joined in 2001 in a major moment for world trade and Russia became the world\u2019s last major economy to become a member, in 2012. With the US the most powerful nation in the WTO and the driving force behind its creation in 1995, much of the organisation is hewn in the image of America. Trump, however, views membership as a \u201cdisaster\u201d. Besides using tariffs to protect domestic industries, countries often provide support to certain sectors through state subsidies, or impose quotas restricting the volume of goods imported from overseas. There are also non-tariff barriers; such as patent rules, health and safety regulations, labour and environmental standards, and rules of origin (for example, parmesan cheese can only come from northern Italy). Non-tariff rules have forged countries\u2019 domestic policies closer together in recent decades to enable greater levels of international trade. After all, we wouldn\u2019t want to have higher car safety standards for foreign goods than our own. Herein lie many of the arguments about how Britain will arrange its trade with the EU or US after Brexit. There are fears the US would push Britain to lower its food safety standards. That could allow the sale of chlorinated chicken. Meanwhile, Brexiters are concerned the UK adhering to EU rules could hinder trade deals with the rest of the world. Do trade deficits matter? Many economists would argue trade deficits are an irrelevance, although surpluses are often seen as economic virility symbols. Persistent deficits require funding via international borrowing, which becomes harder if confidence in a country falls. There are other risks from reliance on imports over domestic production. National security is one: should a country sacrifice the ability to produce steel required for making tanks, for example. Trump is using national security legislation for much of his tariffs, although some observers argue he has done so because the law is harder for the US political system to block, delay or modify. The other risk is that imports support jobs overseas, rather than at home. Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! was the president\u2019s rallying cry ahead of his election. Workers in industries competing most with imports \u2013 typically in manufacturing \u2013 do tend to lose out, economists have found, while employment shifts towards sectors less exposed to trade. Without smooth transitions for struggling industries, or the safety net of the welfare state \u2013 through jobseeker benefits, education and training \u2013 whole communities can be left bereft of work. Britain during the 1980s was a classic example, as the government of Margaret Thatcher chose to shut UK mines and import coal from South Africa and Argentina. Is free trade always the answer? Trade deals always create winners and losers. But while the choice is a matter for politics, these decisions often come amid an onslaught of lobbying from powerful vested interests. Some observers argue free trade deals are therefore often simply the result of rent-seeking by politically well-connected parties. The failed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the US and the EU is one recent example, where corporate interests including the US private health industry wanted to expand to new markets in Europe. The deal ultimately failed amid widespread public opposition. There are fears trade deals benefit larger corporations already operating across international borders, rather than smaller firms. Domestic producers can be squeezed out by global rivals with huge economies of scale. The argument could be best put by the political theorist Isaiah Berlin who noted \u201cfreedom for the pike is death for the minnows\u201d. However, international firms often support networks of smaller companies in their supply chains. Greater trade barriers can make it more difficult for multinationals to operate across borders, meaning they could relocate elsewhere where it is easier for them to do so \u2013 directly and indirectly affecting jobs and economic growth. After the gradual advance of globalisation in recent years, rapidly unpicking the progress may cause severe short-term pain. Economists argue international competition stimulates greater innovation and productivity, while warning protectionism can hinder progress. The quantity and quality of Soviet cars and other eastern bloc goods serves as one example, while the poor reputation of cars made by the British motor industry during the 1970s might be another. Consumers have benefited as the quality of goods have improved and prices have fallen. What next? There are already signs Trump\u2019s import tariffs and retaliatory measures are having an effect. Industrial surveys show manufacturers are suffering from higher costs of materials and longer delivery times in the US and the eurozone, while production is also slowing. Harley-Davidson has said it will need to move production of motorcycles for European consumers outside the US after the EU carried through a threat to tax American motorbikes, following the imposition of steel tariffs by Washington. In the UK, Airbus and BMW have warned of lost jobs and withheld investment triggered by uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU. Figures from the Office for National Statistics already report falling levels of business investment in the UK since the EU referendum. The existing US tariffs are forecast by economists to trigger American job losses as well as weaker economic growth, despite the pledge by Trump that the taxes should save US jobs. The International Monetary Fund warns global growth could slow by as much as 0.5% by 2020, worth as much as $430bn (\u00a3328bn). There are fears the situation could spiral further, as countries retaliate by imposing ever higher taxes on one another\u2019s goods. The next major flashpoint will come when the US completes a national security investigation into car and truck imports, due before February next year. For the UK, the key test for leaving the EU will come in October when the European Council meets to consider the Brexit deal, ahead of Britain formally withdrawing in March next year. The disputes could rumble on for many years. Although the EU has hit back against US steel and aluminium tariffs with $3.2bn of levies on US goods, it has held back a second round of duties on $4.2bn with an implementation date of June 2021 to put pressure on the White House.",

Trump is using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/08/donald-trump-metal-tariffs-trade-war\">national security legislation</a> for much of his tariffs, although some observers argue he has done so because the law is harder for the US political system to block, delay or modify.</p> \n<p>The other risk is that imports support jobs overseas, rather than at home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/31/donald-trump-jobs-analysis\">Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!</a> was the president\u2019s rallying cry ahead of his election. Workers in industries competing most with imports \u2013 typically in manufacturing \u2013 do tend to lose out, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5cd85d00-f08b-11e5-9f20-c3a047354386\">economists have found</a>, while employment shifts towards sectors less exposed to trade.</p> \n<p>Without smooth transitions for struggling industries, or the safety net of the welfare state \u2013 through jobseeker benefits, education and training \u2013 whole communities can be left bereft of work. Britain during the 1980s was a classic example, as the government of Margaret Thatcher chose to shut UK mines and import coal from South Africa and Argentina. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/gloab-trade-03-08-18/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Briefing box 2\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/gloab-trade-03-08-18/embed.html\">Briefing box 2</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Is free trade always the answer?</strong></h2> \n<p>Trade deals always create winners and losers. But while the choice is a matter for politics, these decisions often come amid an onslaught of lobbying from powerful vested interests. Some observers argue free trade deals are therefore often simply the result of rent-seeking by politically well-connected parties.</p> \n<p>The failed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> between the US and the EU is one recent example, where corporate interests including the US private health industry wanted to expand to new markets in Europe. The deal ultimately failed amid widespread public opposition.</p> \n<p>There are fears trade deals benefit larger corporations already operating across international borders, rather than smaller firms. Domestic producers can be squeezed out by global rivals with huge economies of scale. <br></p> \n<p>The argument could be best put by the political theorist Isaiah Berlin who noted \u201cfreedom for the pike is death for the minnows\u201d.<br></p> \n<p>However, international firms often support networks of smaller companies in their supply chains. Greater trade barriers can make it more difficult for multinationals to operate across borders, meaning they could relocate elsewhere where it is easier for them to do so \u2013 directly and indirectly affecting jobs and economic growth. After the gradual advance of globalisation in recent years, rapidly unpicking the progress may cause severe short-term pain.</p> \n<p>Economists argue international competition stimulates greater innovation and productivity, while warning protectionism can hinder progress. The quantity and quality of Soviet cars and other eastern bloc goods serves as one example, while the poor reputation of cars made by the British motor industry during the 1970s might be another. Consumers have benefited as the quality of goods have improved and prices have fallen. </p> \n<p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n<h2><strong>What next?</strong></h2> \n<p>There are already signs Trump\u2019s import tariffs and retaliatory measures are having an effect. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/02/eurozone-factory-output-tariff-manufacturing-eu-us-trade-war\">Industrial surveys show</a> manufacturers are suffering from higher costs of materials and longer delivery times in the US and the eurozone, while production is also slowing. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/25/harley-davidson-production-us-eu-tariffs-motorcycles\">Harley-Davidson</a> has said it will need to move production of motorcycles for European consumers outside the US after the EU carried through a threat to tax American motorbikes, following the imposition of steel tariffs by Washington. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/22/theresa-may-will-listen-to-airbus-brexit-concerns-no-10-says\">Airbus and BMW have warned of lost jobs and withheld investment</a> triggered by uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU. Figures from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/nov/23/uk-growth-figures-business-investment-spending-retail-sales-productivity-downgrade-business-live\">Office for National Statistics</a> already report falling levels of business investment in the UK since the EU referendum. </p> \n<p>The existing US tariffs are forecast by economists to trigger American job losses as well as weaker economic growth, despite the pledge by Trump that the taxes should save US jobs. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/16/imf-trump-trade-war-global-economy-us-tariff-weo\">International Monetary Fund</a> warns global growth could slow by as much as 0.5% by 2020, worth as much as $430bn (\u00a3328bn). There are fears the situation could spiral further, as countries retaliate by imposing ever higher taxes on one another\u2019s goods. </p> \n<p>The next major flashpoint will come when the US completes a national security investigation into car and truck imports, due before February next year. </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>For the UK, the key test for leaving the EU will come in October when the European Council meets to consider the Brexit deal, ahead of Britain formally withdrawing in March next year. </p> \n<p>The disputes could rumble on for many years. Although the EU has hit back against US steel and aluminium tariffs with $3.2bn of levies on US goods, it has held back a second round of duties on $4.2bn with an implementation date of June 2021 to put pressure on the White House.<br></p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2></h2> \n<p><br></p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>",

      "bodyText": "Greenpeace has called on the Australian government to suspend the sale of the weedkiller Roundup after a US court ruled it had caused the terminal cancer of an American man. On Friday, the San Francisco superior court of California ruled that Roundup caused school groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2013 a fatal blood cell cancer. The jury also found that manufacturer Monsanto \u201cknew for decades\u201d the product was potentially dangerous, and acted \u201cwith malice or oppression\u201d by failing to warn Johnson of the risks. The weedkiller is widely available in Australian supermarkets and hardware stores, and Greenpeace said the government must now take \u201curgent action\u201d to restrict it. The active chemical in Roundup \u2013 glyphosate \u2013 was classified as \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d in 2015 by the World Health Organisation. It is still approved for use in Australia, and is the most commonly used herbicide in the world. Monsanto\u2019s vice president, Scott Partridge, has insisted that Roundup is safe, saying on Friday that the \u201cverdict doesn\u2019t change the four-plus decades of safe use and science behind the product\u201d. A spokeswoman for Monsanto in Australia told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe US Environmental Protection Agency and regulatory authorities around the world, including Australia, support the fact that glyphosate does not cause cancer.\u201d But Greenpeace said the federal government should suspend the use of glyphosate until more studies were conducted. \u201cWe need to be urgently exercising the precautionary principle,\u201d said Jamie Hanson, Greenpeace\u2019s head of campaigns. \u201cUse of this dangerous product should be severely restricted. \u201cRoundup is widely available for sale in Australia ... potentially exposing millions of people to its harmful effects. This case is only the first of hundreds that have been filed in the US claiming Roundup causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We have no idea how far this will spread and how many more are to come.\u201d The UK hardware chain Homebase announced it would review its sale of Roundup in the wake of the court decision. But Bunnings Warehouse in Australia said it had not removed Roundup because it was still classified safe by the government regulator. \u201cWe follow advice from Australia\u2019s chemical regulator, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, for this product,\u201d Clive Duncan, Bunnings\u2019s director of marketing and merchandise, said. \u201cWe take customer and team member welfare extremely seriously and strongly recommend users read and follow the directions and recommendations listed on the labels and packaging.\u201d The chief executive of Cancer Council Australia, Professor Sanchia Aranda, said Roundup posed no threat to \u201cmum-and-dad gardeners\u201d as long as they took precautions. \u201cThis risk is only classified for people who use it in the workplace on a regular basis,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no evidence there is a danger to mum-and-dad gardeners, or kids who play in parks where Roundup is being sprayed. \u201c[Wear] protective clothing to stop it getting on your skin \u2013 it doesn\u2019t need to be industrial protection \u2013 just make sure your arms and legs are covered. Wear a mask so you don\u2019t inhale it.\u201d But she said this advice would change if Monsanto was hiding more information about Roundup. \u201cThe most concerning thing is the suggestion that they are holding any information back. We want to emphasise that if there is other information that Monsanto have, that they must be transparent. We have zero tolerance for companies who protect their shareholders over the public.\u201d The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority confirmed the court decision would not change Roundup\u2019s status in Australia. \u201cThe APVMA is aware of the decision in the Californian superior court,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cGlyphosate is registered for use in Australia and APVMA approved products containing glyphosate can continue to be used safely according to label directions.\u201d Monsanto said it intenedd to appeal against the decision in the US. Shares in an Australian maker of a similar product, Nufarm Ltd, fell 17% after the weekend\u2019s decision, hitting a two-year low.",
