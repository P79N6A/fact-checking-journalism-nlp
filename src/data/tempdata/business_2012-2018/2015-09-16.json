      "bodyText": "Beer brands Peroni and Grolsch could combine with Stella Artois and Budweiser to create one of the world\u2019s largest companies, after Anheuser-Busch InBev approached rival SABMiller about a $275bn (\u00a3177bn) tie-up. The mega-deal to combine the two largest players in the industry would be the eighth-largest takeover of all time and would create a company that produces a third of the world\u2019s beer. SABMiller brews Peroni, Grolsch and London-based craft beer Meantime while AB InBev owns Stella Artois, Budweiser and Corona. The brewery industry has been awash with speculation about a major deal involving AB InBev and SABMiller for months. However, City sources said that SABMiller is likely to launch a fierce defence against a deal and could instead look to combine with Diageo, the British owner of Guinness and Johnnie Walker whisky. SABMiller, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, began life in 1886 when Charles Glass began making Castle beer for gold miners in South Africa. A decade later, South African Breweries was founded off the back of Castle\u2019s success and the company became the largest beer producer in the country. During apartheid, SAB was forced to abandon its ambitions to expand overseas and instead diversified into other sectors such as food and furniture. However, in the 1990s, at the end of apartheid, it focused again on beer and snapped up a string of overseas rivals. Under the leadership of Graham Mackay, who moved the company to London from Johannesburg, it bought Grolsch, Foster\u2019s and the Miller Brewing Company, which led to the creation of SABMiller. However, following the death of Mackay, the chairman, in 2013, speculation has grown that SABMiller could become a takeover target itself. AB InBev was only formed in 2008 by the merger of Anheuser-Busch, the American maker of Budweiser, and InBev, which itself was an amalgamation of Belgium\u2019s Interbrew, the owner of Stella Artois, and AmBev, the Brazilian maker of Brahma. Since the creation of AB InBev, the enlarged company has bought Grupo Modelo, the owner of Corona, for more than $20bn. SABMiller revealed in a stock market statement that AB InBev had informed the brewer it intends to make a takeover proposal, although no bid has yet been received. AB InBev then confirmed the approach and said it wanted to work with SABMiller on a deal, rather than pursuing a hostile takeover. Under British takeover rules, AB InBev now has four weeks to make a formal bid or request an extension. If it fails to do either, the company will be blocked from making an approach for SABMiller for six months. The combined company would be worth $275bn. Shares in SABMiller rose 20% to \u00a336.14 on Wednesday, valuing the brewer at \u00a358.8bn. AB InBev shares rose 6.4%, valuing the company at $184bn. The deal is likely to attract the attention of competition regulators around the world, particularly in the US, where the brands would distribute Budweiser, Miller and Coors, the latter through SABMiller\u2019s joint venture with Molson Coors. However, this issue could be resolved by SABMiller selling its 58% stake in the MillerCoors joint venture. The leading brewers are exploring mergers and acquisitions as sales of established brands come under pressure from craft beers. Spiros Malandrakis, an analyst at Euromonitor International, said: \u201cAs the craft movement is coming of age and solidifies its position as a key disruption force within beer and the entire alcohol industry, corporate consolidation can perhaps provide some last drops of stock market intoxication.\u201d The key players in deciding whether a deal between AB InBev and SABMiller goes ahead will be Altria, the US tobacco company that owns more than a quarter of SABMiller\u2019s shares, and 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity group. 3G controls almost half of AB InBev alongside the Belgian families that used to own Interbrew. Fitch, the rating agency, said a deal would create a \u201cglobal player\u201d that widens the gap with rivals Heineken and Carlsberg. \u201cIt would be exposed to high growth and profitable markets and would require only limited divestments in relation to market overlaps,\u201d it added. In a statement, SABMiller said: \u201cThe board of SABMiller notes the recent press speculation and confirms that Anheuser-Busch InBev has informed SABMiller that it intends to make a proposal to acquire SABMiller. \u201cNo proposal has yet been received and the board of SABMiller has no further details about the terms of any such proposal. The board of SABMiller will review and respond as appropriate to any proposal which might be made.\u201d In response, AB InBev said: \u201cAB InBev confirms that it has made an approach to SABMiller\u2019s board of directors regarding a combination of the two companies,\u201d it said. \u201cAB InBev\u2019s intention is to work with SABMiller\u2019s board toward a recommended transaction.\u201d How the two companies compare SABMiller Year founded: 2002 Key brands: Grolsch, Peroni, Foster\u2019s Pints sold per year: 57bn Employees: 69,000 Market value: \u00a359bn Chief executive: Alan Clark Profits: \u00a34.1bn AB InBev Year founded: 2008 Key brands: Stella Artois, Budweiser, Corona Pints sold per year: 81bn Employees: 150,000 Market value: \u00a3118bn Chief executive: Carlos Brito Profits: \u00a311.9bn AB InBev\u2019s brands Stella Artois Budweiser Corona Brahma Boddingtons Leffe Hoegaarden Lowenbrau Bass SABMiller\u2019s brands Grolsch Peroni FostersMillerMeantime Lech Blue Moon Castle",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has edged closer to its first interest rate rise in nine years after two policymakers told MPs an increase was needed soon to head off pay rise-induced inflation. The UK is recovering in strength and is unlikely to be knocked off course by volatile global markets, the rate-setters said in an appearance at the Treasury select committee. Ian McCafferty, one of nine members of the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, said the return of real wage rises this year and the prospect of higher oil prices would force Threadneedle Street to raise rates in the near future. \u201cOver the course of 2016 and 2017, the risks are that wages will pick up a little faster than the central forecast embedded in the August report, such that we would see a slightly greater inflation overshoot by early 2017 than the central projection in the forecast.\u201d McCafferty\u2019s bullish remarks chimed with Kristin Forbes, another rate-setter, who said that there was already very little slack left in the British economy. She said that in order to head off inflation, rates would need to increase in the not-too-distant future. Their comments indicate a shift on the MPC towards a more hawkish stance. In July, the Bank governor Mark Carney said the picture on a rate increase would only be clear enough around the end of the year. This month, McCafferty was the only one of the MPC\u2019s nine members who voted to increase borrowing costs from their record low of 0.5%. Forbes\u2019s colleague Martin Weale was more circumspect, however, though he said his views were similar to those of McCafferty. Weale said he was concerned that a recent return to higher rates of productivity may prove to be \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d and could quickly revert to the lacklustre rates of last year. He said he had also held off voting to raise interest rates because of developments in China, and that he was cautious about the chance of further economic shocks that could push down consumer price inflation, which weakened back to zero in August. \u201cNot only my experience of the period of above-target inflation but also more general statistical analysis suggests that apparently independent inflation shocks tend to come like buses, more than one at a time,\u201d Weale said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I would necessarily give a great deal of weight to but it is something that makes me a bit more cautious.\u201d Carney, also appearing at the Treasury select committee, joined his colleagues in talking up the UK economy, which he said was growing above trend and was relatively immune to external shocks from emerging markets. He defended the Bank\u2019s role against those who would force it to adopt a wider remit than just an inflation target. John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw and opponent of Jeremy Corbyn, asked in a thinly veiled reference to the new Labour leader whether the Bank would redirect the \u00a3375bn invested under the quantitative easing programme into public works. Carney said in response: \u201cThe issue would be imperiling potentially the achievement of price stability. The consequence of that of course would be inflationary. \u201cThe people who tend to get hurt the most by inflation are the poor, the elderly, those that can\u2019t hedge themselves \u2013 that\u2019s been the experience throughout history and I\u2019m sure that will be the experience in the future if the Bank of England were not to conduct policy not consistent with achieving its mandate from parliament.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Over in Greece bankers are saying that the quick formation of a new government will almost certainly lead to the relaxation of debilitating capital controls. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Since the imposition of capital controls at the end of June, business activity has been brought almost to a grinding halt. Unable to pay suppliers, small and medium sized companies have been hardest hit with exports and imports not only severely curtailed but further exacerbating the country\u2019s economic tailspin. Bank figures show that cash-starved smaller companies have often been forced to make more frequent imports at higher prices \u2013 the only way of circumventing the demand of suppliers overseas for large sums up front for merchandise But bankers are now saying restrictions are likely to be further relaxed \u2013 bank transactions abroad were relaxed earlier this month - if Greece moves fast to regain the trust it lost with its European partners (during fraught negotiations over its latest bailout) by forming a reform-minded government after Sunday\u2019s elections. Six months of wrangling with creditors saw a bank run of around \u20ac40bn. \u201cOnce banks are recapitalized and deposits flow back, that will lessen dependence on the European Central Bank and make further lifting of the controls easier,\u2019 said one banker. Withdrawals from ATMs \u2013 now controlled at \u20ac420 a week \u2013 may be among the restrictions to be lifted. But insiders cautioned against speculation that the controls would be entirely removed. \u201cA lot will rest on the type of government that is put in place but even if it is ultimately a government of technocrats, restrictions will be with us for some time yet,\u201d said the banker speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cOur big fear, central to the controls right now, is the outflow of deposits. Everyone worries that if we lift them altogether people will rush to take whatever they have out with everything that means for a system that is already fragile.\u201d On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The prospect of a Greek exit from the euro was \u201cnever for real\u201d, according to V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, vice-president of the European Central Bank in an interview this week with Thomson Reuters. Here is the relevant passage. Const\u00e2ncio said: We have growth again. We need to strengthen the confidence in peripheral countries. That has to be achieved by deepening integration. The Greek turmoil raised doubts. These doubts have to be now closed by additional institutional reforms. Q. What doubts were raised about the euro? It raised doubts for the markets that countries like Greece could cope with the challenges of monetary union. There was never any doubt among the majority of member countries. We maintain that the euro is irreversible. Legally, no country can be expelled. The actual prospect of that happening was never for real. Despite the continuing uncertainty about whether or not the Federal Reserve will raise rates on Thursday, investors were in fairly buoyant mood. The betting seems to be coming down on the side of no move - just about. Meanwhile news of a possible merger between drinks groups SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev saw both companies share prices soar and give a lift to stock markets, notably the FTSE 100. Energy companies were also in demand as crude prices moved higher after an unexpected fall in weekly US inventory data. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 jumped 91.61 points or 1.49% to 6229.21 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.38% to 10,227.21 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.67% to 4645.84 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.71% to 22,059.21 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.99% higher at 9976.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.51% to 692.44 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 92 points or 0.56% higher. Thursday\u2019s Federal Reserve decision on interest rates is still too close to call, according to the latest Reuters poll. But the pendulum has swung slightly in favour of the central bank keeping borrowing costs on hold: Oil prices are surging after an unexpected fall in US crude stocks last week. Crude inventories fell by 2.1m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to expectations of a rise of 1.2m barrels. The news has sent Brent crude nearly 5% higher to $50.10 a barrel, with West Texas also on the rise: Bank governor Mark Carney said that if wage growth moves about 3% and unit labour costs rise, then a decision on a rate hike comes into sharper relief. (A reminder that average pay rose by 2.9% in the three months to July.) MPC member Ian McCafferty, who voted for a rate rise last time round: More from the UK Treasury select committee quizzing Bank of England governor Mark Carney and members of the rate-setting monetary policy committee (Ian McCafferty, Kristin Forbes, and Martin Weale): Meanwhile the Bank has released reports to the committee from Mark Carney and Kirstin Forbes. Ahead of the all important Federal Reserve decision on interest rates, US markets have joined in the global rally, adding to Tuesday\u2019s gains. In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 29 points or 0.18%. Elsewhere the FTSE 100 is 1.32% higher - helped by the news of a possible merger between drinks groups SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev - while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.11%. The other MPC member at the Treasury Select Committee, Kristin Forbes, is also worried about volatility: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is up before the Treasury Select committee to discuss the latest inflation report. On interest rates he said there was \u201ca wide distribution of possible outcomes around any expected path for bank rate.\u201d He said the timing of a rate rise would be in sharper focus at the turn of the year. One uncertainty of course has been the recent worries about the outlook for China\u2019s economy. He said there was \u201cdownside risk\u201d but not enough to adjust the Bank\u2019s forecasts at the moment. Monetary Policy Committee member Ian McCafferty said he had moved from believing rates should remain on hold to believing they should rise because he was worried about the prospect for the inflation outlook, notwithstanding any international risks. But former hawk (although he criticised the term) Martin Weale said it was not appropriate for a rise because of the Chinese slowdown, further recent falls in oil and raw material prices and weak UK productivity. The US inflation data is likely to add to the chances of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates on hold on Thursday, said Har Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research. He said: Now that the last important economic data releases ahead of tomorrow\u2019s FOMC decision is out, we know as much as before: The main growth engine of the US economy, the consumer, has been doing well \u2013 at least until before the financial market volatility began (we are confident that this improvement has continued and will continue, but the data for this period still has to be released). The manufacturing sector, on the other hand, still suffers from global headwinds, the stronger US dollar, and \u2013 in the short-term \u2013, from an inventory correction. Finally, inflation rates are currently held back by transitory factors. While the core CPI still stands at a relatively solid 1.8% year on year, it has lost some momentum since June, mostly due to the renewed decline in energy prices. Moreover, the Fed prefers to look at the Personal Consumption Expenditures deflator excluding food &amp; energy, which has slowed in July to 1.2% year on year, the lowest since early 2011. We had pointed out before that this number is artificially biased downward by low health care costs, but FOMC members still seem to see it as their benchmark measure. Low inflation, in combination with the fact that the risk averse Fed would like to get a better sense about how the latest global developments \u2013 read: the slowdown in China, the related stock market sell-off and the renewed decline in oil prices \u2013 affect the outlook for growth and inflation, most likely mean that the FOMC will leave rates unchanged at this week\u2019s meeting. The August US inflation figure will probably not change the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates, said Rob Carnell of ING Bank. He expects no change from the central bank although admits a small hike could be on the cards: US August CPI was the last significant piece of data standing between the Federal Open Market Committee and its rate decision on Thursday, and it came in almost bang on expectations, with the only marginal deviation from expectations being the core inflation rate, which was unchanged at 1.8% year on year - though from an expected 0.1% month on month gain, so almost certainly just a rounding effect. Headline inflation was unchanged at 0.2% year on year, dragged down by a 2.0% month on month decline in energy prices \u2013 not surprisingly. his result doesn\u2019t even give a directional boost to the hawks, which might have been the case if energy had dragged just a little less. That said, this was never likely to be a decisive piece of data, and the FOMC members will probably go into this meeting already with a good idea of what they want to do. Recent data will have played a minor role in that conclusion. Our base case remains no hike with a strong hint for October, but a small (less than 25 basis point hike) still looks like a strong call to us. Followers of the eurozone debt crisis should check out this story from Athens, on the worrying rise of Greece\u2019s extremist Golden Dawn party, ahead of Sunday\u2019s elections: The US monthly inflation rate has turned negative, giving the Federal Reserve another reason to hold off raising interest rates tomorrow. Consumer prices unexpectedly fell by 0.1% month-on-month in August, mainly due to cheaper gasoline prices. This left the annual Consumer Prices index unchanged at 0.2%. This is the first drop in the monthly inflation rate since January, defying expectations of a small rise in prices. In response, the yield on American government debt has dropped a little, suggesting the Fed is less likely to hike tomorrow. Sterling is continuing to strengthen, as today\u2019s wage growth figures fuels predictions the the Bank of England could raise interest rates sooner than expected. The pound has now gained a whole cent against the US dollar to $1.5445. It\u2019s also up 1% against the euro to a six-day high of \u20ac1.3744, meaning one euro is worth 72.66p. On a different note, a survey from City firm M&amp;G Investments has found little appetite among European citizens for any more government bailouts. M&amp;G reports that Spain is the only country where a majority of people back the concept (Spain being one country that could have been dragged into the eurozone debt crisis) Given the mess suffered by Greeks since 2010, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising. But it could make it harder for Europe to grow and drive down unemployment, as M&amp;G\u2019s Jim Leaviss explains: To become an Optimum Currency Region, the Eurozone needs fiscal transfers between areas doing well, and areas where the economy is weak. The survey data confirm that the majority of the public do not support such transfers. This is perhaps no surprise \u2013 we blogged a couple of years ago that some German states are vehemently against fiscal transfers even within Germany itself, let alone to other EU members. The lack of public support does not mean that there can be no bailouts \u2013 we\u2019ve already had sovereign bailout programmes within the EU. But it does mean that they lack democratic support and perhaps also that political parties that reflect the anti-bailout views of voters are likely to do well in the future. It also means that the agents for future bailouts are likely to remain institutions one step removed from the democratic process, such as the ECB and the IMF. And whilst we can look at these results and tell ourselves that they are an indication that the European project is flawed and broken, we should ask ourselves how Californians would vote if they had a choice about fiscal transfers to Detroit, or if the UK\u2019s Home Counties were asked if they wanted to continue redistributing tax revenues to former industrial areas elsewhere in the country..... More here: New M&amp;G YouGov survey: there\u2019s very low support in Europe for sovereign bailouts The rise in annual wage growth to 2.9% in the last quarter suggests the cost of living crisis is finally easing (although not for everyone, of course). My colleague Heather Stewart reports: Pay for Britain\u2019s workers is rising at the fastest pace for more than six years, even before George Osborne\u2019s national living wage is implemented, in a sign that living standards are continuing to rise. Official figures showed that average pay across the economy increased by 2.9%, when comparing May to July with the same period a year earlier. The growth rate was the same once bonuses were taken into account. The Office for National Statistics said that was the fastest pace of wage growth since the three months to January 2009 \u2013 and with inflation running at 0.1% in July, that suggests the long-running squeeze on living standards has come to an end. City analysts said the pay data suggested consumer demand, a key driver of economic growth, would be underpinned by the rise in real wages. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cJuly\u2019s marked strengthening in earnings growth coupled with consumer price inflation dipping to 0.0% in August is very good news for consumers\u2019 purchasing power.\u201d Osborne said the figures were an indicator his economic plan was working. \u201cIt is welcome news that pay packets are rising and jobs are being created,\u201d he said. \u201cWith wages up 2.9% over the year and inflation low, working people have received the fastest real terms rise in over a decade.\u201d Here\u2019s Heather\u2019s full story: Britain\u2019s youth unemployment rate is too high, and falling too slowly, warns Lindsay Owen, Deputy Director of Policy at The Prince\u2019s Trust. She says: \u201cWhile overall unemployment continues to fall steadily, there is a real danger that young people could be left behind. Whereas overall unemployment has fallen by 8 per cent over the past 12 months, youth unemployment has only fallen by 1 per cent, barely shifting for a year. \u201cSuch a sustained period of stalling clearly shows there is an ongoing and pressing need for us to help young people develop the skills and confidence they need to move into work and have the best possible chance of building a successful future.\u201d And here\u2019s some context: For May to July 2015, for people aged from 16 to 24, there were: 3.90 million people in work (including 907,000 full-time students with part-time jobs) 723,000 unemployed people (including 245,000 full-time students looking for part-time work) 2.63 million economically inactive people, most of whom (2.04 million) were full-time students Young people continue to get the rough end of the labour market, although the situation is slowly improving. The youth unemployment rate (for 16 to 24 year olds) was 15.6% in the three months to July, almost three times the overall rate. It is also: lower than for February to April 2015 (16.1%) lower than for a year earlier (16.6%) higher than the pre-downturn trough of 13.8% for the 3 months ending February 2008 Owen Smith MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, is concerned that unemployment rose by 10,000 in the last quarter: Here\u2019s his response: \u201cIt\u2019s welcome news that workers\u2019 pay packets are increasing after years of stagnating. However, this is now the third consecutive increase in unemployment and Ministers mustn\u2019t become complacent about overall joblessness. \u201cWith such low levels of productivity persisting in the workforce and high levels of youth unemployment, the Government must do more to bring about an increase in the number of secure jobs in the British economy. \u201cRather than stripping workers of their employment rights and taking thousands of pounds a year out of the pockets of millions of working families across the UK, the Government should be backing British workers to bring confidence and optimism back into our workforce.\u201d Another reason for caution. The number of women classed as unemployed spiked by 23,000 in the three months to July. The number of unemployed men fell by 13,000, though, meaning the unemployment total rose by 10,000. That\u2019s compared to the February-April quarter. Today\u2019s labour market report isn\u2019t all good news, especially for those already employed in the public sector or looking for work. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, explains: \u201cIt\u2019s now fairly clear that the UK labour market recovery changed tack in the first half of the year. The previous and prolonged \u2018jobs-rich/pay-poor\u2019 trend appears, at least for now, to have gone into reverse, with the headline unemployment rate static at 5.5% since the spring while the rate of pay growth has risen to 2.9%. The good news is that this provides further evidence that the much needed improvement in labour productivity may at last be underway. However, while this will be welcomed by employers, wage earners and economic pundits, the news is not so good for jobseekers because it now looks as though it will take a little longer than previously expected for unemployment to fall back to the pre-recession rate. \u201cPublic sector workers will also be feeling less than chipper. Their pay is rising at a rate of 1.3%, almost three times slower than the average rate of pay growth in the private sector, while the first half of the year saw an underlying fall (adjusting for statistical reclassification effects) of 22,000 in the number of people employed in the public sector.\u201d And this graph shows how the public sector workforce has shrunk on David Cameron\u2019s watch: This chart explains why S&amp;P have downgraded Japan: It shows that country\u2019s national debt is expected to keep rising until the 2020s, to 250% of GDP. Just in - Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has hit Japan with a credit rating downgrade, warning that prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s attempts to stimulate growth is faltering. S&amp;P has cut Japan\u2019s rating from AA- to A+, which is only the fifth highest rating. It\u2019s still one notch higher than Fitch, who cut Japan to A in April. Andy Scott, economist at HiFX, has explained why today\u2019s data sent the pound jumping this morning: Average earnings rose at their fastest pace in six years in July, showing that the improving labour market is feeding increased wage demands \u2013 a sign that employers are willing to pay more to keep existing, or hire new workers. \u201cThe news of individuals seeing strong pay growth in real terms should continue to support domestic demand and economic growth, all the more important when the global growth outlook is weakening. This also tallies with consumer confidence which has recently been at a 15-year high, as people\u2019s improving financial position boosts sentiment. \u201cSterling rose more than half a percentage point against the dollar to 1.54, and by the same against the euro to 1.37 as the news supports those at the Bank of England who are signalling rates will need to rise \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d... The pound has jumped half a percent against the US dollar, on the back of today\u2019s labour market report. Traders are calculating that Britain\u2019s rising wage growth means the Bank of England may raise interest rates sooner. Update. The Treasury have amended George Osborne\u2019s comments: Breaking away from unemployment....the OECD has just issued a new report, warning that the world economy is slowing. It has cut its forecast for global growth from 3.1% to 3.0%, and trimmed China\u2019s from 6.8% to 6.7%. More here: Chancellor George Osborne has hailed the rise in wage growth, and taken a swipe at new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (although not completely successfully). Here\u2019s the statement: \u201cIt is welcome news that pay packets are rising and jobs are being created. With wages up 2.9% over the year and inflation low, working people have received the fastest real terms rise in over a decade. At 73.5%, the employment rate is the highest it has been. But we still face risks both from the global economy and from those at home who would undermine our economic security, hike taxes and privatise industry. This government will continue to support firms, increase training and provide more free childcare for working parents, as well as introducing a National Living Wage.\u201d I think he means \u2018....and nationalise industry\u2019.... Here\u2019s some instant reaction to today\u2019s UK labour market report, focusing on the news that wage growth is running at its fastest rate since 2009. You can download a pdf of today\u2019s unemployment report here. Here are the key points: There were 31.09 million people in work, 42,000 more than for February to April 2015 and 413,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 22.74 million people working full-time, 361,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 8.36 million people working part-time, 52,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 73.5%, little changed compared with February to April 2015 but higher than for a year earlier (72.8%). There were 1.82 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 10,000 more than for February to April 2015 but 198,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate was 5.5%, unchanged compared with February to April 2015 but lower than for a year earlier (6.2%). The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labour force (those in work plus those unemployed) who were unemployed. There were 8.99 million people aged from 16 to 64 who were economically inactive (not working and not seeking or available to work), 24,000 fewer than for February to April 2015 and 65,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The inactivity rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were economically inactive) was 22.1%, little changed compared with February to April 2015 but down slightly from a year earlier (22.3%). Comparing May to July 2015 with a year earlier, both total pay (including bonuses) and regular pay (excluding bonuses) for employees in Great Britain increased by 2.9%. Wages across the UK have risen at their fastest pace since 2009. The ONS reports that average pay rose by 2.9% in the three months to July, compared to a year ago. That\u2019s the strongest growth rate for regular pay (excluding bonuses) since 2009. That\u2019s an encouraging sign, suggesting that the recovery is feeding through to pay packets. And with inflation at zero, it means real wages are running at a pretty decent rate. But it also raises the chances of an earlier interest rate rise, if the Bank of England concludes that inflationary pressures are building. Today\u2019s report also shows a drop in the total hours worked. The number of people in work across Britain rose by 42,000 quarter-on-quarter to 31.09 million. That leaves the employment rate little changed at 73.5%, a record high. Speaking on Sky News right now, employment minister Priti Patel says: The economy is still growing, with more people in work than ever before. Today\u2019s report shows that there were 1.82 million unemployed people in Britain in the three months to July. That\u2019s 10,000 more than in February to April, but it\u2019s also lower than the 1.85 million recorded a month ago. Here comes the UK unemployment data. And the top line is that the jobless rate has fallen back to 5.5% in the three months to July, compared to 5.6% in the three months to June. That\u2019s better than expected. Lots more to follow.... Economists will scrutinise today\u2019s unemployment data for signs that the labour market is weakening. These charts, from last month\u2019s jobless report, show how the UK employment has dipped recently, after hitting a record high in the spring. China\u2019s late surge is helping to keep shares up in Europe, but that rally could fade away if the UK jobless data (due in 40 minutes) is weak. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Wage growth is expected to see a mild increase, from 2.4% to 2.5% (though the figure has missed estimates for the past 2 months), whilst the claimant count change is forecast to decrease by 5.1k against the 4.9k drop announced in August. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, is expected to remain at 5.6% after unexpectedly creeping up from 5.5% in July. In anticipation of these results the FTSE was up by around 30 points, though that increase is lower than its initial 50 point high. There\u2019s excitement in China right now where the stock market has surged by almost 5%. After a subdued start, the Shanghai composite index leapt in late trading to close 147 points higher at 3,152. That reverses two days of losses, which were blamed on rising worries over the Chinese economy. A few theories are circulating to explain today\u2019s recovery. One is that Beijing authorities intervened, again, to get the index back over the 3,000 point mark. Another is a rumour that Global index compiler MSCI is going to include the Shanghai market in its global index. A third is that traders are optimistic that the Fed will sit tight tomorrow, and leave US interest rates unchanged. But sometimes, you\u2019ve got to admit that there\u2019s no easy answer: Commodity trading giant Glencore is leading the FTSE 100 risers this morning, up over 4%, after raising $2.5bn through a share placement last night. Glencore certainly needs the money. The slump in commodity prices has left the Swiss based firm with a $30bn debt mountain, which will be trimmed to $20bn once the rescue plan announced last week is implemented. Shares had hit a new record low last night, having shed around three quarters of their value since it floated just four years ago. A blow to millions of Brits whose pension funds hold Glencore shares, although at least billionaire founder Ivan Glasenberg and top colleagues are sharing the pain (and investing more money via this placement). Today\u2019s rally shows relief that one hurdle is cleared. But two more remain, as my colleague Nils Pratley explains: The first is Glencore\u2019s vulnerability to more falls in the prices of copper and coal. The former has shown signs of stability in the last week, partly because Glencore itself is shutting a couple of mines, but coal shows no hint (yet) of reaching a trough. After the fundraising, Glencore is less indebted than it was but, remember, the starting point was borrowings of $30bn. The second factor can\u2019t be measured so precisely. It is the damage to Glasenberg\u2019s reputation for reading the market. Last year\u2019s $1bn share buyback \u2013 at an average of roughly 300p a share versus 128p now \u2013 was plainly a mistake, born of over-optimism..... More here: Europe\u2019s stock markets are opening now, and shares are rising. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 41 points or 0.7% at 6167. The pound is flat, as traders await the jobless data. The German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB shares indexes have all gained 1%. Traders may be less worried about tomorrow meeting of the Federal Reserve, where policymakers will decide whether or not to hike interest rates. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: Is fear receding ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Fed decision? Are markets less worried about a hike or more convinced of no change? Consensus remains divided after the latest US data. The employment data may also show that average earnings rose over the summer. CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson explains: Today\u2019s average earnings data are expected to continue to contribute to a rise in disposable incomes with a rise from 2.8% to 2.9% for the three months to July, excluding bonuses. The ILO unemployment rate for July is expected to remain stable at 5.6% with August jobless claims set to decline by 5k. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover if Britain\u2019s employment market is weakening, when the latest jobless data is released by 9.30am. The figures will show the unemployment total in the three months to July, and also how many people claiming jobless benefits in August. We\u2019ll also see whether wages picked up. After a solid run recently, the last two months\u2019 data have been unexpectedly weak. UK unemployment rose by 15,000 in the three months to May, for the first time in two years. That trend continued the next month, with an extra 25,000 people out of month in the quarter to June. Economists predict that the jobless rate will remain unchanged at 5.6%, and that the claimant count will dip by around 5,000. We\u2019ll find out soon. The unemployment data will be scrutinised in Westminster, as well as the City, as Labour\u2019s new leader Jeremy Corbyn faces David Cameron at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions at noon. Get the popcorn ready. Yesterday we learned that Britain\u2019s inflation rate has fallen back to zero, as weak energy and lower food prices keep the cost of living pegged back. At 10am it\u2019s the eurozone\u2019s turn to report inflation data. Economists expect an annual rate of just 0.2%. Anything weaker will put more pressure on the European Central Bank to consider fresh stimulus measures. Then at 1.30pm BST we get America\u2019s August inflation report, which is the final clue to how the Federal Reserve might act at Thursday\u2019s FOMC rate-setting meeting. We should also hear from Bank of England governor Mark Carney this afternoon when he, and senior colleagues, testifies to the Treasury select committee on the latest inflation report. Kickoff is 2.15pm. Not much corporate news to entertain us, although JD Sport is reporting results this morning and trainmaker Hornby has warned that revenues will be weaker than expected this year. And there\u2019s just four days to go until the Greek general election. Excitement isn\u2019t exactly at fever pitch yet, though. The latest poll puts the conservative New Democracy (ND) party slightly ahead of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s Syriza: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day...",

Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>Since the imposition of capital controls at the end of June, business activity has been brought almost to a grinding halt. Unable to pay suppliers, small and medium sized companies have been hardest hit with exports and imports not only severely curtailed but further exacerbating the country\u2019s economic tailspin. Bank figures show that cash-starved smaller companies have often been forced to make more frequent imports at higher prices \u2013 the only way of circumventing the demand of suppliers overseas for large sums up front for merchandise </p> <p>But bankers are now saying restrictions are likely to be further relaxed \u2013 bank transactions abroad were relaxed earlier this month - if Greece moves fast to regain the trust it lost with its European partners (during fraught negotiations over its latest bailout) by forming a reform-minded government after Sunday\u2019s elections. Six months of wrangling with creditors saw a bank run of around \u20ac40bn.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8f14d5896407844080497690a4c3219543c5db0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8f14d5896407844080497690a4c3219543c5db0/0_0_5616_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowds trying to enter Greek banks in Athens in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowds trying to enter Greek banks in Athens in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Geiss/dpa/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>\u201cOnce banks are recapitalized and deposits flow back, that will lessen dependence on the European Central Bank and make further lifting of the controls easier,\u2019 said one banker. Withdrawals from ATMs \u2013 now controlled at \u20ac420 a week \u2013 may be among the restrictions to be lifted. </p> <p>But insiders cautioned against speculation that the controls would be entirely removed. \u201cA lot will rest on the type of government that is put in place but even if it is ultimately a government of technocrats, restrictions will be with us for some time yet,\u201d said the banker speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cOur big fear, central to the controls right now, is the outflow of deposits. Everyone worries that if we lift them altogether people will rush to take whatever they have out with everything that means for a system that is already fragile.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><em><strong>On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening.

Finally, inflation rates are currently held back by transitory factors. While the core CPI still stands at a relatively solid 1.8% year on year, it has lost some momentum since June, mostly due to the renewed decline in energy prices.</p> <p>Moreover, the Fed prefers to look at the Personal Consumption Expenditures deflator excluding food &amp; energy, which has slowed in July to 1.2% year on year, the lowest since early 2011.</p> <p>We had pointed out before that this number is artificially biased downward by low health care costs, but FOMC members still seem to see it as their benchmark measure.

That said, this was never likely to be a decisive piece of data, and the FOMC members will probably go into this meeting already with a good idea of what they want to do. Recent data will have played a minor role in that conclusion. Our base case remains no hike with a strong hint for October, but a small (less than 25 basis point hike) still looks like a strong call to us.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55f965e1e4b0197216fcea4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-16T12:52:40.791Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Followers of the eurozone debt crisis should check out this story from Athens, on the worrying rise of Greece\u2019s extremist <strong>Golden Dawn</strong> party, ahead of Sunday\u2019s elections:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/greek-election-2015-golden-dawn-austerity\">Greek election 2015: Golden Dawn exploits atmosphere of austerity-driven despair</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55f9620ee4b0ee9ae5e2a93e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-16T12:41:41.474Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US consumer prices fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The US monthly inflation rate has turned negative, giving the Federal Reserve another reason to hold off raising interest rates tomorrow.</strong></p> <p>Consumer prices unexpectedly fell by 0.1% month-on-month in August, mainly due to cheaper gasoline prices.

      "body": "<p>A former foreign exchange trader at Lloyds Banking Group has accused the bank of making him redundant because he was a whistleblower after he raised concerns about the unit, including about a currency trade for supermarket Tesco.</p> <p>According to evidence presented to a London employment tribunal, Paul Carlier claims his redundancy from the bailed-out bank in September 2014 was because he had \u201cchallenged the business over various practices\u201d and made \u201cprotected disclosures\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was targeted. I was selected and that was it, and everything that happened thereafter was window-dressing to make it fit,\u201d Carlier said as he cross-examined Anders Henrikson, the bank\u2019s head of foreign exchange product.</p> <p>Carlier, who is representing himself and is yet to give evidence, had a \u00a3175,000 salary and received a \u00a350,000 bonus, according to Henrikson\u2019s witness statement.</p> <p>As Carlier\u2019s case opened, another former Lloyds employee who had been bringing a case for unfair dismissal against the bank withdrew his case. Andrew Reed had submitted rates for Libor, the interest rate over which banks around the world have been fined after they were found to have manipulated it. Lloyds <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/28/lloyds-suspends-seven-people-rigging-rates-libor\">was fined \u00a3226m last year for rate-rigging offences</a>.</p> <p>According to Henrikson\u2019s witness statement, Carlier sent emails after being informed of his redundancy that were \u201clengthy, frequently offensive in tone and content and repetitive\u201d. They were initially blocked by the bank\u2019s firewall because of their content.</p> <p>On the trade for Tesco, the size and nature of which was not disclosed, Carlier raised concerns after it was partially completed in July 2014.

      "bodyText": "A former foreign exchange trader at Lloyds Banking Group has accused the bank of making him redundant because he was a whistleblower after he raised concerns about the unit, including about a currency trade for supermarket Tesco. According to evidence presented to a London employment tribunal, Paul Carlier claims his redundancy from the bailed-out bank in September 2014 was because he had \u201cchallenged the business over various practices\u201d and made \u201cprotected disclosures\u201d. \u201cI was targeted. I was selected and that was it, and everything that happened thereafter was window-dressing to make it fit,\u201d Carlier said as he cross-examined Anders Henrikson, the bank\u2019s head of foreign exchange product. Carlier, who is representing himself and is yet to give evidence, had a \u00a3175,000 salary and received a \u00a350,000 bonus, according to Henrikson\u2019s witness statement. As Carlier\u2019s case opened, another former Lloyds employee who had been bringing a case for unfair dismissal against the bank withdrew his case. Andrew Reed had submitted rates for Libor, the interest rate over which banks around the world have been fined after they were found to have manipulated it. Lloyds was fined \u00a3226m last year for rate-rigging offences. According to Henrikson\u2019s witness statement, Carlier sent emails after being informed of his redundancy that were \u201clengthy, frequently offensive in tone and content and repetitive\u201d. They were initially blocked by the bank\u2019s firewall because of their content. On the trade for Tesco, the size and nature of which was not disclosed, Carlier raised concerns after it was partially completed in July 2014. Henrikson\u2019s witness statement said: \u201cIt is important to appreciate that colleagues in sales have no mandate to take risk or trade in their own account. The suggestion by Paul that the sales desk was going to buy back [the amount of the order that had not yet been confirmed to the client at a lower price to make a profit] was therefore not feasible unless Paul or another trader with a risk mandate would have facilitated such a transaction.\u201d Henrikson said the issues raised by Carlier were general. They also included matters relating to a trading system known as ProTrade. \u201cPaul was vocal in expressing his opinions on the spot [foreign exchange] desk but I did not regard him as a whistleblower,\u201d said Henrikson. He also rejected a claim by Carlier that \u201che felt intimated, bullied and harassed by me\u201d. According to Henrikson, Carlier also raised issues about his own authorisation with the City regulator. During the hiring process in 2011, Lloyds discovered that Carlier had a number of county court judgments against him. Lloyds said: \u201cAs the employment tribunal is ongoing, it would be inappropriate for us to comment in detail, other than to say that the allegations are without merit and we are defending them vigorously.\u201d The hearing continues.",

      "bodyText": "Many practitioners of the \u201cgloomy science\u201d are the object of scathing criticism these days, either for having taken their eyes off the financial ball in the run-up to the banking crisis or for retreating into mathematical byways. But Barry Moore, who has died aged 74 of a heart attack, belonged to the old school of \u201capplied\u201d economists \u2013 a breed always concerned with practical issues, and much in demand around the world. His early speciality lay in regional policy \u2013 a subject that almost fell into desuetude from the later years of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government, once Michael Heseltine had used development corporations to revive the fortunes of Merseyside and London Docklands, but which now seems to have been rediscovered by their Conservative successors. While a member of the highly regarded and at times controversial Cambridge Economic Policy Group, headed by Wynne Godley and known to some as \u201cthe Treasury in exile\u201d, Barry produced two notably influential papers with John Rhodes: Evaluating the Effects of British Regional Economic Policy (1973) and The Relative Decline of the UK Manufacturing Sector (1976). The latter anticipated many of the subsequent arguments about the causes and extent of deindustrialisation in the UK economy. The importance of assisting ailing regions to revive with new sectors for economic growth has been supplemented by the development of city \u201chubs\u201d. These are closely connected with the encouragement of public and private sector co-operation on research and innovation, not least with an emphasis on the science base, for which the Cambridge Silicon Fen \u2013 a British equivalent to California\u2019s Silicon Valley \u2013 has become world famous. Barry was a pioneer in demonstrating how the economic expertise and research methods developed in the academic environment of a university could be successfully applied and exploited in the commercial sector. From 1985 he pursued this aim as one of the founders of PACEC (Public and Corporate Economic Consultants), sometimes in conjunction with the Centre for Business Research, of which he was a research fellow. He came to be regarded as a leading international authority in the evaluation of innovation and science policy, and his work was held in the highest regard by policymakers. Both a macro- and micro-economist, he managed to combine an active teaching career with the publication of eight books and more than 100 academic articles and papers. Born in Ruskin College, Oxford, to which his mother had been evacuated during the second world war, Barry was the son of Rena (nee Vandersteen) and Charles, who both worked in the clothing industry. From Beal grammar school (now Beal high school) in Ilford, Essex, he went to the London School of Economics, where he gained a BSc in economics (1965), followed by master\u2019s degrees both there (1968) and at Cambridge (1973). He held research posts at the department of applied economics in Cambridge between 1970 and 1985, joining shortly before Godley became director, and to his appointment as director of studies in economics at Downing College, Cambridge (1979-90), he added a range of university posts. He went to the department of land economy as assistant director of research in 1985 and became reader there in 2003. For nearly three decades, he taught international economic issues to visiting Americans through Instep, the Institute of Economic and Political Studies. Many benefited not only from his economic knowledge but also from his encyclopedic knowledge of wine. I, too, knew him as a well-rounded character, a jovial bon vivant who was wonderful company. He belonged to the true Keynesian tradition of serious application to study combined with thorough enjoyment of the good things in life. But whereas Keynes\u2019s leisure pursuits were associated with Bloomsbury, Barry preferred Soho. A cousin who was vicar of St Anne\u2019s church, Soho, introduced Barry at the age of 16 to the pubs and clubs of the area, where he got to know Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and that rather different category of artist, Jeffrey Bernard. Favourite venues were the French House and the Groucho Club. Keith Waterhouse proposed him for membership of Gerry\u2019s Club, another haunt of actors and Soho types. Barry is survived by his wife, Lesley (nee Simm), whom he married in 1966, and their three daughters, Charlotte, Natasha and Jessica. \u2022 Barry Charles Moore, economist, born 18 March 1941; died 18 August 2015",

The European court of justice ruled that the KitKat\u2019s shape was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the chocolate covered wafer. Nestl\u00e9 is not seeking to trademark its two-fingered version of KitKat. Nestl\u00e9 had argued that even without its red and white packaging or the word KitKat embossed on the chocolate, the shape of the bar should be regarded as distinct. The dispute between Nestl\u00e9 and Cadbury, which has fought to prevent Nestl\u00e9 securing a trademark, will go back to the UK high court for a final ruling that will determine whether rivals will be able to launch copycat KitKats in Britain. Despite the court\u2019s failure to allow the trademark, Nestl\u00e9 said it was pleased with the ruling. Nestl\u00e9 suffered a setback in June when the advocate general of the European court of justice, whose opinions are usually followed by the court, said the company\u2019s attempts to trademark the KitKat shape did not comply with EU law. Nestl\u00e9, the world\u2019s biggest food group, and Cadbury, owned by US group Mondel\u0113z , have been in a tit-for-tat battle over the distinctiveness of their chocolate products. Cadbury decided to try and thwart Nestl\u00e9\u2019s attempt to trademark KitKat in 2010 after Nestl\u00e9 blocked Cadbury\u2019s effort to trademark the shade of purple used for its chocolate wrappers. The UK Trade Marks Registry turned down Nestl\u00e9\u2019s application to protect the chocolate bar in the UK in 2013, following Cadbury\u2019s opposition. Rowntree &amp; Co sold the first KitKat, then called Chocolate Crisp, in 1935 and the shape remains roughly the same now. Its name changed to KitKat Chocolate Crisp and then, after the second world war, to KitKat.

A bid has been rumoured for years and the timing carries a whiff of opportunism \u2013 before Wednesday, SAB\u2019s shares had slipped 20% from their springtime high, hit by general worries about growth in emerging markets. If, like the Brazilian billionaires behind AB InBev, you keep your eyes on five- and 10-year horizons, that\u2019s an opening. Yet there is an obvious problem with this takeover approach. The market for bland lager (a description that applies to the bulk of AB InBev\u2019s output and a fair slug of SAB\u2019s) has already been consolidated to the point where competition regulators around the world will be on red alert. AB InBev is the world\u2019s largest brewer \u2013 its convoluted name reflects how many businesses have been thrown in the barrel \u2013 and SAB is the second biggest. Together, the duo would have almost a third of the global beer market, towering over the next biggest player, Heineken, with about 10%. Regulators are bound to force disposals. In the US, SAB\u2019s 58% stake in Miller-Coors would have to go since Miller and AB InBev\u2019s Budweiser would not be allowed to co-habit. In China, SAB\u2019s joint venture is the top player and AB InBev comes in third: local regulators wouldn\u2019t permit that combination. And something would have to give in both companies\u2019 sideline of bottling fizzy drinks, since SAB works with Coca-Cola and AB InBev with Pepsico. AB Inbev\u2019s calculation, one assumes, is that, even after a spin in the regulatory mixer, enough prime assets will remain. SAB brings the old South African Breweries, a big player in Africa, which is relatively unexplored territory for AN Inbev. Then there a few local monopolies, such as in Colombia, where SAB has about 99% of the market. Best of all from AB Inbev\u2019s point of view, it has to win the backing of only two SAB shareholders to get this deal close to the finishing line. Altria, spun out of the old Philip Morris, has 26%, and the Colombian Santo Domingo family, have 14%. Even so, SAB hardly needs a rescuer. Graham Mackay, the chief executive who led SAB\u2019s expansion into global brewer, died two years ago but he built a robust company. Pre-tax profits were flat last year at $4.83bn (\u00a33.14bn) but cash flow remains strong and the dividend was raised 8%. Altria and the Santo Domingos could demand a takeover premium that would test even AB Inbev\u2019s deal-making appetite. SAB\u2019s shares are up about 600p, or 20%, on Wednesday, at a shade over \u00a336. It might require another 25% on top \u2013 meaning an offer of at least \u00a345 a share \u2013 to force SAB\u2019s board to the negotiating table. To get that far, AB Inbev would have to spy huge scope for cutting costs. This is tricky given that nobody would describe SAB, with a top-line profit margin of 24%, as flabby. Don\u2019t doubt AB Inbev\u2019s willingness to consume every big brewer in the world, given half a chance and a large helping of cheap debt. But, from the point of the poor old drinker, this takeover approach feels depressingly stale already \u2013 another round of consolidation that hasn\u2019t noticeably made everyday beer cheaper.",

      "bodyText": "Under intense security and privacy, 12 people are gathering in Washington DC to make decisions that could change the lives of everyone in the US \u2013 and much of the rest of the world. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will on Wednesday and Thursday thrash out a decision on whether to raise US interest rates, which have been held at near-zero since the 2008 financial crisis. If rates do rise, it will likely lead to higher mortgage, car and personal loan and credit card rates in the US, and spark central banks throughout the rest of the developed world to also consider raising their interest rates. For months, economists had been expecting a rate rise (dubbed \u201cliftoff\u201d by Fed officials) at this meeting, but their enthusiasm has waned markedly following last month\u2019s global stock market panic over the health of the Chinese economy. The decision will be announced by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen at a highly anticipated press conference in Washington on Thursday. Even if rates aren\u2019t raised, every word that she says \u2013 and how it reflects the committee\u2019s confidence in the US economy \u2013 has the potential to significantly move global markets. The FOMC members, who are often in close agreement, appear to be deeply split about whether they think the economy can handle an increase in rates, which could put companies off investing and hiring more employees. John Williams, an FOMC member and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, has been bullish about the strength of the US economy for most of the year but appeared much more cautious last week. \u201cAll of the data that we have had up until now has been, I think, encouraging,\u201d he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. \u201cBut there are some pretty significant \u2013 and I would say have now grown larger \u2013 headwinds that have developed.\u201d His counterpart from Minneapolis, Narayana Kocherlakota, is even less confident. \u201cI don\u2019t see a near-term increase in interest rates as being appropriate, and by near-term I mean really through the course of 2015,\u201d he told CNBC at the recent central bankers jamboree in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve and the most important US central banker after Yellen, has also said the idea of raising rates this month isn\u2019t as \u201ccompelling\u201d as it was before the China-led stock market chaos. On the other side of the table, Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice-chairman, has said recent \u201cimpressive\u201d jobs growth \u2013 to the level the government considers effective full employment \u2013 creates a \u201cpretty strong case\u201d to raise rates in September. \u201cWe\u2019re getting back to normal and at some point we will want to show that, by beginning to normalize interest rates,\u201d he said recently. Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, reckons employment conditions needed for a rate rise have \u201clargely been met\u201d, but he is less certain on inflation. \u201cRecent reports on wages and salaries still show few signs that the tightening labor markets are translating to increases in wages and salaries consistent with reaching 2% inflation,\u201d he said. US prices have risen by 0.3% over the past year, and inflation has lingered below the Fed\u2019s 2% target for more than three years. Goldman Sachs analysts this week said in a report they expect rates to be left unchanged, but think the Fed will signal that \u201cliftoff is near\u201d. ING economists said Thursday\u2019s decision will be \u201cthe most eagerly awaited in years\u201d, though they also expect rates to be left unchanged \u2013 \u201cbut this is a very close call\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Hornby has warned that disruption from installing a new computer system and problems supplying model railways to Europe will cause first-half revenues to fall. The maker of train sets, Airfix kits and Corgi cars introduced a new system in July to replace antiquated processes for stock control, sales and distribution. Combined with weak overall retail sales, disruption caused by installing the new system affected Hornby\u2019s UK summer trading, the company said in an update. The system has since settled in and sales volumes are back to levels higher than last year, it said. Hornby also suffered lower revenues in European countries such as Italy and France as it struggled to get products onto shelves from new suppliers in China. The company said UK revenues would be up slightly in the six months to the end of September but that European weakness would bring overall sales down. The Kent-based toymaker was bugged by distribution problems for many years, caused by recurring problems at its Chinese manufacturer and suffered a \u00a31.1m loss in 2014. It has extricated itself from the contract and signed up with a range of alternative providers in China but is still encountering problems supplying countries outside the UK. Hornby said: \u201cThe UK [system] implementation has, as expected, had its challenges. As the system was introduced, trading was impacted throughout July and August, against a backdrop of a weaker general retail environment. \u201cEuropean sales are currently being impacted by ongoing problems with supply of international model rail. We are working hard to overcome these issues and we are confident that supplies of these products will improve in time.\u201d Hornby\u2019s shares, which had risen almost 50% in the past year, fell 4% to 101.26p in late morning trading. Hornby said its results for the year ending in March would depend greatly on trading over the Christmas period. Manufacturing for the UK is ahead of plan in trains and Scalextric, which is producing a James Bond Spectre set to tie in with the next film in the Bond franchise. Richard Ames, Hornby\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cEarly indications from our customers are positive and we have an exciting pipeline of new products that are being well received.\u201d Hornby said it expected its annual results to be better than last year\u2019s when underlying pre-tax profit was \u00a31.6m.

      "bodyText": "The planned \u00a36bn flotation of Worldpay is back on track after one of its private equity backers warned of the risks of backing a bid from French rival Ingenico. Bain Capital, one of the two main backers of the British payment processing company, is becoming increasingly nervous about agreeing to a deal with Ingenico. It believes the risks attached to such a transaction are high, given that the French group would be doubling its market capitalisation to do the deal. It would also need shareholder approval. \u201cThe Ingenico share price is under pressure as investors worry about whether it can pay a sufficiently high price and still make the deal work,\u201d said a source close to Bain. Ingenico\u2019s share price has fallen from \u20ac125 to \u20ac98 over the past month as its interest in a deal has been made known. One of the bank advisers advising on the deal has also argued that a stock market flotation offers the group greater certainty, despite the risks of higher interest rates. Bain Capital and Advent, the private equity owners of Worldpay, were scheduled to announce details of the \u00a36bn share issue this week but postponed the announcement last Friday as Ingenico showed signs of wanting to increase its bid. Sir Mike Rake, the Worldpay chairman, left the board of Barclays bank in order to steer Worldpay to the public markets. This time last year he chaired roadside assistance group, the RAC, as it prepared for a flotation but left when the Singapore wealth fund GIC bought a stake instead. Some of those advising Worldpay on a flotation have cautioned against the current instability of the markets and the possibility of them being further shaken by a rise in US interest rates. However, they also know that agreeing a deal with Ingenico is not without considerable risk. Investment bankers are hoping that a \u00a36bn flotation would help kickstart the new issues market in London, which has been relatively quiet since the election and the summer months, also troubled by the turmoil on the China markets. So far there have been 53 UK issues this year, compared with 93 at the same time last year, according to Dealogic. Some of the large flotations this year have included DFS Furniture in February, which had a valuation of \u00a3585m, and Autotrader, which was valued at \u00a32.35bn.",

Shares in SABMiller soared by more than 22% following the announcement, while AB InBev rose 11%. SABMiller revealed in a stock market statement that AB InBev had informed the drinks company it intends to make a takeover proposal, although no bid has yet been received. ABInBev confirmed the approach and said it wanted to work with SABMiller on a deal, rather than pursuing a hostile takeover. A combination of the brewers would create a company with a market value of about $250bn (\u00a3162bn). It would bring together Stella Artois and Budweiser with SABMiller\u2019s brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and British craft beer Meantime. The brewery industry has been awash with speculation about a major deal and City sources have long touted the prospect of AB InBev and SABMiller combining. AB InBev\u2019s largest shareholder is 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity group, which has snapped up major food companies including Heinz and has a track record of major deals in the beer industry. SABMiller is listed in London and South Africa and employs 69,000 people around the world. AB InBev is listed in Brussels and New York. In a statement, SABMiller said: \u201cThe board of SABMiller notes the recent press speculation and confirms that Anheuser-Busch InBev has informed SABMiller that it intends to make a proposal to acquire SABMiller. \u201cNo proposal has yet been received and the Board of SABMiller has no further details about the terms of any such proposal. The board of SABMiller will review and respond as appropriate to any proposal which might be made.\u201d In response, AB InBev said: \u201cAB InBev confirms that it has made an approach to SABMiller\u2019s board of directors regarding a combination of the two companies,\u201d it said. \u201cAB InBev\u2019s intention is to work with SABMiller\u2019s board toward a recommended transaction.\u201d Spiros Malandrakis, analyst at Euromonitor International, said the companies were being forced to act in the face of the growing popularity of craft beers. He said: \u201cAs the craft movement is coming of age and solidifies its position as a key disruption force within beer and the entire alcohol industry, corporate consolidation can perhaps provide some last drops of stock market intoxication.\u201d AB InBev\u2019s brands Stella Artois Budweiser Corona Brahma Boddingtons Leffe Hoegaarden Lowenbrau Bass SABMiller\u2019s brands Grolsch Peroni FostersMillerMeantime Lech Blue Moon Castle",

      "bodyText": "The world economy appears to be suffering a slowdown in growth that will stretch through the rest of the year and 2016, according to a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development. Heightening concerns that a period of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d is about to dampen the prospects for global growth, the Paris-based thinktank said China\u2019s economy was flagging and recent stock market turmoil had exposed the fragility of many emerging market economies. But the steady progress made by some of the largest developed economies, including Britain, the US and Germany was maintaining the global recovery. Nevertheless, the OECD described the outlook for the next couple of years as one characterised by \u201cpuzzles and uncertainties\u201d as the growth prospects for Japan and the uneven pace of growth among eurozone countries revealed a mixed and confusing picture. It said: \u201cThe US recovery remains solid, but there are puzzles around developments in other major economies. Growth in the euro area is improving, but not as fast as might be expected. \u201cErratic data in Japan raise questions about the robustness of the recovery there. And growth dynamics in China are difficult to assess, with conflicting signals coming from different indicators.\u201d It added: \u201cThis leaves the outlook clouded by important uncertainties.\u201d The OECD, which counts the world\u2019s richest nations among its membership, said in its interim economic forecast that the prospect of higher interest rates in the US and UK had exposed the vulnerability of emerging market economies to higher borrowing costs. It urged the US Federal Reserve to maintain its course for higher interest rates, but called on its officials to signal that the pace of increases will be slow, allowing those countries that have borrowed heavily in dollars to adjust to the jump in costs. It said there were also \u201cincreasing doubts about the medium-term growth of economic potential in advanced and emerging economies alike\u201d. This is likely to be seen as a clear reference to concerns that secular stagnation has become the over-arching feature of the major economies, restricting growth. The term, which has grown in popularity since it was adopted by former US Treasury adviser Larry Summers, depicts western nations as gripped by higher health and pension costs associated with ageing populations that increase the emphasis on saving at the expense of investment and improved productivity. The UK is expected to remain on track to grow by 2.4% this year and 2.3% next year. But most countries covered by the report are likely to slow in 2016 from the OECD\u2019s previous forecast in June. Brazil is expected to be one of the hardest hit by the slowdown in China and by its exposure to higher borrowing costs following a US interest rate rise. It will suffer a bigger recession this year and remain in recession next year after a 1.8 percentage-point downgrade by the OECD in its 2016 forecast.",

In the six months to 1 August, pre-tax profit before exceptional items jumped 82%, from \u00a325.5m a year earlier, as revenue surged 21% to \u00a3809.9m. Statutory pre-tax profit rose 88%. Sales at stores open a year or more increased by more than 10%, as shoppers bought trainers made by Nike and other leading brands. It said trading in August and September had been encouraging, suggesting JD was not badly affected by weak clothing sales on British high streets over the summer. JD shares have more than doubled in price in the past year. They rose to a record 917p after the results announcement and were up 0.7% at 900p in afternoon trading. Brian Small, JD\u2019s finance director, said footwear and women\u2019s sportswear had sold especially well. \u201cWe are strong across the board. We are particularly pleased with trainer sales and we are doing better than ever with ladies\u2019 wear. Various fitness classes are popular at the moment, such as yoga and pilates.\u201d He said JD was also benefiting from people taking part in sport into middle and old age. JD has been one of British retailing\u2019s success stories, defying gloomy patches in the wider market, such as last Christmas, by capitalising on sporting fashion wear. It has carved out an upmarket niche by selling the latest items from in-demand brands such as Adidas as well as its own lines, including Duffer of St George. Small said JD\u2019s close links with Adidas and Nike, and spending to keep stores looking smart, gave it access to sought-after products as well as brands such as Giorgio Armani\u2019s EA7 that its rivals, which include Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, do not supply. \u201cOur customers tend to be young and the brands they wear are important to them. They believe it gives them status and it\u2019s important to them that they have the latest ranges.\u201d Most of JD\u2019s 690 stores are in the UK but it is expanding in the Netherlands, Spain, France and Germany in a bid to become Europe\u2019s top sports fashion retailer. JD said its was confident about its expansion plans but that growth was likely to slow from the past two years and profit margins would be affected by the weak euro. Small said: \u201cIf you look around the retail universe, there won\u2019t be many retailers that would expect to get another full year of double-digit like-for-like sales. We are a cautious management team and we don\u2019t want to over promise. It\u2019s a sensible observation rather than a flashing warning light.\u201d JD said it was making progress in turning around its loss-making outdoor business, which trades under the Millets, Blacks and Ultimate Outdoors brands. The division\u2019s loss narrowed to \u00a34.5m from \u00a35.6m a year earlier.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Interest rates in the US have been close to zero since the depths of the financial crisis but global investors are braced for change, as the country\u2019s central bank prepares to raise borrowing costs. The first in an expected string of small increases could come this week, with the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee starting a two-day meeting on Wednesday where it will consider a rise. The ramifications of the decision, announced on Thursday, will extend beyond the world\u2019s largest economy. What is happening this week? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets official US interest rates, meets on Wednesday and Thursday and announces its latest policy decision on Thursday at 7pm UK time (2pm Washington DC time). Minutes from its last meeting in July suggested members were getting ready to hike interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. So-called \u2018lift-off\u2019 could perhaps be as soon as this September meeting. Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, or Fed, will give a news conference half an hour after the announcement and investors will be looking to her for clues on future moves from the central bank. Even if the Fed has just hiked, Yellen is expected to take a \u201cdovish\u201d tone, emphasising that any further tightening will be gradual and only happen when economic conditions are right. How does the central bank influence the economy? The 12-member FOMC holds eight scheduled meetings a year, around every six weeks, when it decides on key short-term interest rates to meet its economic goals of \u201cmaximum employment and stable prices\u201d. When deciding whether to raise these rates the committee will weigh up news from the US labour market, the likely outlook for inflation and developments in the global economy. The committee sets a target for the Federal Funds rate, a key interest rate between commercial banks which in turn influences borrowing costs throughout the economy. That rate has been held close to zero (technically it is a range of 0.0% to 0.25%) since 2008. Since 2008 the Fed also sought to buoy the crisis-hit US economy with a vast bond-buying programme. That quantitative easing (QE) scheme involved printing money to buy assets off financial institutions, in the expectation that they would reinvest the funds in the wider economy. Why are interest rates so low? Extraordinary times warrant extraordinary monetary policy, is the thinking from the Fed. In its own words: \u201cThe financial crisis that began in 2007 was the most intense period of global financial strains since the Great Depression, and it led to a deep and prolonged global economic downturn.\u201d So why should US rates rise now? This week marks seven years since the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers and, on the surface, the world\u2019s biggest economy appears to have put the global financial crisis behind it. In that case, why leave monetary policy on an emergency setting? Unemployment is at 5.1%, the lowest since March 2008. Economic growth has been picking up. GDP rose at a 3.7% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the second quarter of 2015. Unless these stronger conditions are matched by more normal monetary policy, economists see risks for inflation rising too high in the future. The Fed\u2019s favoured inflation measure, the index of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), is near zero and well below the central bank\u2019s 2% target. \u201cInflation is not a problem now, but zero rates are a recipe for excess inflation down the road. The longer the wait, the higher the risks. If inflation does break out, the Fed will be forced to tighten aggressively, causing far more damage to the US and global economy than starting now,\u201d says Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief economist David Folkerts-Landau. Federal Reserve vice-chairman Stanley Fischer recently said there was \u201cgood reason to believe that inflation will move higher as the forces holding down inflation dissipate further\u201d. There is also an argument that after all the build-up to a potential rate hike this week, pulling the trigger at last would actually remove some of the volatility from financial markets. \u201cOnce the dust has settled, the combination of a small hike and a relatively dovish statement may be better received than yet another delay. The latter might simply be interpreted as a sign that the Fed is more worried about the global economy,\u201d said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. What are the arguments for waiting? While all may look rosy with the US economy for now, there are a few clouds on the horizon. There have been wild swings on financial markets in recent months and signs that the global economy is losing momentum. The market turmoil stems from China, where an economic downturn has coincided with a stock market rout. Against the backdrop of waning demand from China, oil prices have fallen sharply, keeping a lid on inflation in the US and elsewhere. Falling oil prices also hurt the economy in the US given its role as an energy producer. Responding to volatile global markets, Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve and a member of the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee, said in late August that a September interest rate rise was \u201cless compelling\u201d than it had been a few weeks earlier. What effect would a rate rise have in the US? Whether the Fed edges interest rates up now or later, the move will be seen as the first in a series of small hikes to gradually take borrowing costs to more normal levels. The central bank\u2019s comments and updated economic forecasts on Thursday will be scrutinised for clues. The dollar would likely strengthen on the back of higher official rates and yields would rise on US government bonds. The Fed\u2019s move would also be felt throughout the economy as borrowing costs shift higher. That is good news if you are a saver. Not so good if you are in debt. The prospect of rising rates has already sparked jitters in equity markets and huge movements of capital as investors fear rising costs will affect business borrowing and consumer spending. There have also been warnings that a hike could cost jobs. Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers believes higher rates would mean companies sit on their cash rather than investing in new hires or new equipment. How would a hike be felt outside the US? The biggest concerns about the non-US effects of a Fed hike centre on emerging markets. Money had flowed into fast-growing developing countries while interest rates were at rock-bottom levels in advanced economies but the prospect of an imminent US rate hike has seen those funds start to flow back out as investors move their money on the expectation of improving returns. The pressure on Asian emerging markets, where currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit have slumped to their lowest in more than a decade, has been exacerbated by the prospect of China\u2019s malaise spreading to its neighbours. The Fed would argue, however, that it sets interest rates for the US economy not the rest of the world. For the eurozone, a hike in the US puts policy there even more at odds with the ultra-loose stance of the European Central Bank, which has embarked on its own QE programme. That will put the single currency under pressure against the dollar. Diverging official rates In the UK, the Bank of England (BoE) could follow the Fed\u2019s lead and finally hike interest rates after more than six years at a record low of 0.5%. But UK inflation remains well below the BoE\u2019s target and at its last meeting, only one of the nine-member monetary policy committee voted for a rate hike.",

The central bank\u2019s comments and updated economic forecasts on Thursday will be scrutinised for clues.</p> <p>The dollar would likely strengthen on the back of higher official rates and yields would rise on US government bonds. The Fed\u2019s move would also be felt throughout the economy as borrowing costs shift higher. That is good news if you are a saver. Not so good if you are in debt.</p> <p>The prospect of rising rates has already sparked jitters in equity markets and huge movements of capital as investors fear rising costs will affect business borrowing and consumer spending. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LHSummers/statuses/635778912363126784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No time for an interest rate hike.

      "bodyText": "When we tell someone a secret, we trust them to keep it. We tell our phone providers our secrets every single day, without even really thinking about it. Every text message we send, every call we make, they can see. So when they sell us out, it\u2019s a devastating breach of trust. It\u2019s been four long years since two Vodafone employees accessed a journalist\u2019s call and text records. But only now, after being publicly exposed, has the company referred the matter to the Australian federal police for investigation. Vodafone never contacted the journalist. It never contacted the Australian privacy commissioner. It never contacted the police. The company kept it all in-house in what has become an all too familiar pattern for telecommunications companies caught doing naughty things with their customers\u2019 personal data. It should worry everyone, but it should be a particular concern for journalists. This story only emerged on Saturday when the Australian reported that a Fairfax journalist, Natalie O\u2019Brien, had had her phone records trawled through by a Vodafone employee after she exposed a major data breach by the company. The company acknowledged the breach had occurred, but said at the outset of a first lengthy statement dealing with a number of issues that it denied any improper behaviour. It appeared to backflip a few days later on Tuesday, and informed the AFP about the \u201cpotentially criminal\u201d action. Vodafone has not explained why it chose to wait all this time to refer the matter to police. The company\u2019s primary defence has been that in 2012 it commissioned KPMG to conduct a review into what had happened. The focus of the review does not appear to be on the lawfulness of accessing O\u2019Brien\u2019s phone, but the behaviour of the two men at the centre of the allegations and whether they had been directed by Vodafone management to access O\u2019Brien\u2019s phone records. A Vodafone spokeswoman said the report found: \u201cThere was no evidence VHA management instructed \u2026 [the investigators] to review customers\u2019 text messages or that VHA management was aware they had been accessed.\u201d Vodafone has refused to release the report. It also will not comment on whether the report made any recommendations about what should have been done at the time. It may transpire that the investigators really were acting on their own. But even if that is the case, Vodafone still bears some responsibility for the actions of its employees, and an obligation to its customers to advise them of privacy breaches. Some parts of Vodafone management \u2013 both in Britain and in Australia \u2013 have been aware of this breach since at least 2012. They bear the responsibility to keep their customers\u2019 records safe, and they bear responsibility to take action when a violation of privacy has occurred. When placed into the context of the broader concerns around access to journalists\u2019 phone and web metadata, this episode is even more alarming. Telecommunications companies process these requests on a daily basis from law enforcement authorities. Journalists in particular are relying on unseen employees within these companies to be vigilant that these kind of authorisations from law enforcement agencies meet the legal requirements set out in the act. It doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in this process when it transpires that employees within one of these companies sought to use a journalist\u2019s phone records to track down sources. It shows contempt for the role of journalists and the way they conduct their craft. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance has described the episode as an unforgivable breach. Vodafone\u2019s behaviour is becoming a pattern in the telecommunications sector. These corporations hold vast amounts of personal data. It\u2019s an essential part of their business, so it means a lot to them. Any public exposure of breaches or lapses in security could foreseeably diminish their vast data-driven enterprises. So they don\u2019t report. They keep quiet. They hide it away, and hope that nobody will ever find out. Vodafone has been caught out on this one, but there is a message in this for all tech companies that handle Australians\u2019 personal data: report it when it happens. Take action when it happens. Because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be dragged kicking and screaming into the public domain.",
