      "bodyText": "British motorists face a 10% rise in the cost of their annual car service and repair bills if the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal, an industry body has warned. The UK\u2019s collective car repair bill could rise by more than \u00a32bn due to tariffs and other barriers arising from a hard Brexit, according to a report published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which assumes the UK is forced to fall back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The prediction comes after warnings from various industries about the impact on their sectors of a hard Brexit. They have ranged from the UK nuclear industry highlighting the \u201ccliff edge\u201d faced by not replacing the existing European nuclear treaty, Euratom, to farmers warning that the price of British strawberries could rise by more than one-third if the UK cannot ensure access to European workers after Brexit. Speaking about the motor trade, Mike Hawes, the chief executive of SMMT, said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t secure a new trading relationship with the EU that is free of tariffs and customs checks, British consumers could face significant increases to their annual car repair bill due to new tariffs and other trade barriers. \u201cGovernment must now prioritise an interim arrangement that maintains single market and customs union membership until the right trade deal with the EU is implemented.\u201d The SMMT\u2019s report said a WTO tariff on imported car parts of between 2.5% and 4.5% would cost the average car owner an extra \u00a321 a year for replacement components. Meanwhile, quotas, subsidies, customs delays and regulatory barriers could add an additional \u00a349, adding up to a \u00a32.14bn rise in the UK\u2019s collective car maintenance bill, the trade body said. Theresa May has previously said \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d when it comes to the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, suggesting the prime minister believed that falling back on the default position of WTO rules in the absence of a trade deal with the EU is a credible alternative. However, the Guardian reported in February that leaving the EU without a trade deal would saddle British exporters with more than \u00a36bn a year in new tariffs. The SMMT said: \u201cSome 80% of replacement car parts fitted to British cars are imported, with almost three-quarters of these coming from EU-based suppliers. However, the manufacture of components in the UK is growing, making the risk of tariffs on British products sold in Europe and other key global markets another major concern.\u201d The report concluded that WTO tariffs on automotive parts exported from the UK could cost the domestic industry up to \u00a33bn in lost revenue, \u201cwith a potential impact on future investment and jobs\u201d. Despite talk of no deal, many Brexit observers believe there has been a softening of the government\u2019s stance since the general election, with increasing talk of the UK negotiating a transitional agreement. In research published on Sunday, the political consultancy Eurasia Group said: \u201cTo clear the air and offer more certainty to business than the government\u2019s current nods and winks, ministers believe that May will make a major speech on Europe in September. \u201cThis will update the government\u2019s policy, including on the transitional period. It would mark a significant retreat from the hard Brexit she would have pursued had she won a majority in the June election. \u201cUntil then, however, uncertainty will likely remain on what the transitional deal might involve. UK ministers have not discussed it in any depth. [Philip] Hammond accepts that the UK will technically leave the EU, and its single market and customs union, in 2019. \u201cAt the same time, he is seeking a solution that in practice implies largely accepting free movement of labour, continued budget payments and the continued adoption of EU laws and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, hence dubbed a \u2018status quo\u2019 transition.\u201d The SMMT and Eurasia reports were released as economic optimism fell to the lowest level for six months, according to the latest study of business confidence from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Economic optimism slipped by one percentage point from 18% to 17%, it found. The negative figures came as overall business confidence remained unchanged at 30% in July, the bank said, just below the long-term average of 32%. The share of companies reporting higher business confidence decreased by three points to 45%, but this was offset by those reporting lower confidence, which fell by three points to 15%.",

The stoppage has been called over a below-inflation pay offer to the Bank\u2019s maintenance, security and hospitality staff, and was originally due to begin on Monday. However, the action has been delayed for a day to allow late talks via the conciliation service, Acas, and is now scheduled to last between Tuesday and Thursday if talks fail. Protesters are planning to gather outside the Bank\u2019s headquarters in Threadneedle Street, in the heart of the City of London, on Tuesday wearing masks of Governor Mark Carney and holding placards and flags stating: \u201cBank of England staff want fair pay.\u201d There has never been a strike at the Bank\u2019s headquarters, with the last industrial action affecting the central bank taking place at its printing plant in Essex in the late 1960s. The Unite union said the dispute was caused by the imposition of a 1% increase in the pay pot for the year from March. The union argues the amount an individual would receive was at the discretion of line managers, so that employees could receive less than 1% and some no rise at all. It balloted 84 members, of whom 95% voted for the strike. Although the action involves less than 2% of the Bank\u2019s 4,000-strong workforce, the union has said the threatened strike would make the institution \u201ceffectively inoperable\u201d. The Bank said: \u201cThe Union balloted approximately 2% of the workforce. Should the strike go ahead, the Bank has plans in place so that all sites can continue to operate effectively. We will continue to have discussions with Unite and hope that there will be a positive outcome.\u201d Unite, which describes the pay offer as \u201cderisory\u201d, said: \u201cStaff are angry that the bank has imposed a below inflation pay offer for the second year running. In a gesture of goodwill by the union the start of the strike has been postponed for one day in order to allow for last minute talks to take place at Acas.\u201d The industrial action is scheduled during a busy week for the governor. He will chair a meeting of the monetary policy committee, at which interest rates are expected to be left unchanged at their record low of 0.25%, and on Thursday is due to present the Bank\u2019s inflation report. The inflation report will contain the Bank\u2019s latest economic forecasts.

An earlier version said the strikes would be the first Bank of England strike in 50 years. This has been corrected to say nearly 40 years.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A \u00a3625m project to connect the energy systems of the UK and Belgium has unearthed more than a dozen bombs and mines dating back a century to when the continent was racked by war. Detailed underwater surveys by National Grid, undertaken this year ahead of the laying of the 80-mile interconnector, have detected 19 pieces of unexploded ordnance from the first and second world wars along the seabed on the planned route. The finds highlight the unique challenge of running a power cable in one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, with a history of such intense warfare. \u201cIt\u2019s mines normally, sometimes bombs dropped from aircraft, some are from the first world war. You find mines that are attached to the seabed still, mines that are floating around,\u201d said Mike Elmer, the project director for Nemo Link. The firm and its Belgian partner have had to call in the Royal Navy, and the Belgian and French navies, to explode the bombs and sea mines \u2013 usually a much safer option than removing them. The ordnance is clustered nearest the UK and Belgian shores, mostly found in seas 10-15 metres deep, meaning navy divers have to navigate murky waters to attach explosives and detonate the unexploded bombs. In some cases, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) have also been deployed to explode the ordnance. The largest find was a huge, two-tonne bomb believed to have been dropped by the US airforce, and probably used to destroy concrete bunkers. It was detonated by the Belgian navy earlier in July. The last few pieces of unexploded ordnance are all in Belgian waters. Petty Officer Scotty Eaton, a Royal Navy diver who tackled one of the sea mines recently, said that a four-strong team would first send a diver down to confirm the ordnance, before alerting the coastguard to establish a shipping cordon. PE8 explosives are then attached to the bomb or mine, with the detonation initiated from the surface. \u201cThe biggest challenge we found ... was the tides, they are unpredictable,\u201d Eaton said. Rising tides increased the risk of a diver becoming entangled in their guide line and the detonating cord. Other discoveries in the underwater mapping, undertaken by vessels trailing hi-tech sensors through the water, include a cannon, cannonballs, and an anchor. While the interconnector route has remained largely unchanged by the finds, it was rerouted after pieces of an aircraft wing were found, thought to be from the second world war. As a potential war grave, a 100-metre exclusion zone was ordered. Elmer said the biggest threat to potentially delaying the project had come not from bombs, but a 14th-century ship found in French waters. \u201cIt\u2019s off the route, fortunately, because that would have delayed [the project]. That\u2019s being treated by the French government as archaeology, and as soon as they designate as archaeology, a 100-metre exclusion zone is put through the whole thing,\u201d he said. After works started in October 2015, Nemo Link is now around halfway through construction, and due to be operational in January 2019. It will come onshore near Sandwich in Kent, and Zeebrugge in Belgium. There are four such UK interconnectors at present. At least a further eight, including the one to Belgium, are being laid along the seabed or through the Channel Tunnel in one case, to exchange power between the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Norway. As Britain generates a growing share of electricity from intermittent sources such as windfarms and solar panels, the cables have become increasingly important, providing around 7% of power. They also help dampen down peaks in wholesale prices. One thinktank recently warned that Brexit could put new projects at risk, with a knock-on effect on energy bills. \u201cElectricity interconnection with the EU meets 7% of UK\u2019s electricity needs and keeps consumer energy bills down,\u201d the Green Alliance said. Elmer said that even with the UK leaving the EU, the case for greater interconnection is as important. \u201cBrexit is a complication, it would be foolish to deny it. But we still need to trade power,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>A \u00a3625m project to connect the energy systems of the UK and Belgium has unearthed more than a dozen bombs and mines dating back a century to when the continent was racked by war.</p> <p>Detailed underwater surveys by National Grid, undertaken this year ahead of the laying of the 80-mile interconnector, have detected 19 pieces of unexploded ordnance from the first and second world wars along the seabed on the planned route.</p> <p>The finds highlight the unique challenge of running a power cable in one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, with a history of such intense warfare. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mines normally, sometimes bombs dropped from aircraft, some are from the first world war. You find mines that are attached to the seabed still, mines that are floating around,\u201d said Mike Elmer, the project director for Nemo Link.</p> <p>The firm and its Belgian partner have had to call in the Royal Navy, and the Belgian and French navies, to explode the bombs and sea mines \u2013 usually a much safer option than removing them.</p> <p>The ordnance is clustered nearest the UK and Belgian shores, mostly found in seas 10-15 metres deep, meaning navy divers have to navigate murky waters to attach explosives and detonate the unexploded bombs. In some cases, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) have also been deployed to explode the ordnance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR_oyp9wJ_0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xR_oyp9wJ_0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>A sea mine being detonated.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The largest find was a huge, two-tonne bomb believed to have been dropped by the US airforce, and probably used to destroy concrete bunkers. It was detonated by the Belgian navy earlier in July. The last few pieces of unexploded ordnance are all in Belgian waters.</p> <p>Petty Officer Scotty Eaton, a Royal Navy diver who tackled one of the sea mines recently, said that a four-strong team would first send a diver down to confirm the ordnance, before alerting the coastguard to establish a shipping cordon. </p> <p>PE8 explosives are then attached to the bomb or mine, with the detonation initiated from the surface. \u201cThe biggest challenge we found ... was the tides, they are unpredictable,\u201d Eaton said. Rising tides increased the risk of a diver becoming entangled in their guide line and the detonating cord.</p> <p>Other discoveries in the underwater mapping, undertaken by vessels trailing hi-tech sensors through the water, include a cannon, cannonballs, and an anchor.</p> <p>While the interconnector route has remained largely unchanged by the finds, it was rerouted after pieces of an aircraft wing were found, thought to be from the second world war. As a potential war grave, a 100-metre exclusion zone was ordered.</p> <p>Elmer said the biggest threat to potentially delaying the project had come not from bombs, but a 14th-century ship found in French waters.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s off the route, fortunately, because that would have delayed [the project]. That\u2019s being treated by the French government as archaeology, and as soon as they designate as archaeology, a 100-metre exclusion zone is put through the whole thing,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/07/nemo-zip/giv-3902SA8AN41b9fGF/\" data-alt=\"Nemo Link map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/07/nemo-zip/giv-3902SA8AN41b9fGF/\">Nemo Link map</a> </figure>  <p>After works started in October 2015, Nemo Link is now around halfway through construction, and due to be operational in January 2019.

      "bodyText": "The routes have names that evoke glorious Americana and the frontier spirit: the Empire Builder, the Silver Meteor, the Sunset Limited, the Texas Eagle, the Coast Starlight and the California Zephyr. But a president who ran on a nostalgic promise to \u201cmake America great again\u201d appears to have little interest in reviving once mighty railroads that stood as symbols of American capitalist ambition in the era of the robber barons. While he has touted a $1tn investment plan for America\u2019s infrastructure \u2013 which so far shows few signs of materialising \u2013 the president\u2019s proposed budget included $630m in cuts for Amtrak that would devastate long-distance services. An advocacy group, the National Association of Railroad Passengers (Narp), warned the budget \u201cwipes out funding for long-distance train service in over 220 cities and towns and in 23 states that will lose train service completely\u201d. Almost all those states are in the middle of the country and voted for Trump. Most of the stations said to be at risk are in rural areas. Narp launched a \u201cRally for Trains\u201d campaign that saw events last month across the country, from Portland, Oregon, to Miami, Florida, via Wausau, Wisconsin. One rally was in Alpine, a west Texas town of about 6,000 people in Brewster County \u2013 an area bigger than Connecticut that gave 53% of its votes to Trump in the 2016 presidential election. A Trump-Pence Make America Great Again poster is fixed to a balcony above a store opposite the station along one of Alpine\u2019s main drags, which could pass for a western film set but for a Thai food truck.

Save Alpine\u2019s Amtrak!\u201d A sprightly 71-year-old with a background in marketing, Jamieson fell in love with trains on long trips through her native Canada. She moved to Alpine three and a half years ago, from Massachusetts. Now she leads the local effort to save the station, arranging rallies and letter-writing campaigns. \u201cPassenger service to me is everything,\u201d she said. Owing its existence to the arrival of the Southern Pacific railroad in 1882, Alpine is a gateway to Big Bend national park and the hipster haven of Marfa. The next nearest Amtrak station, Sanderson, is 85 miles away. The loss of a service used by about 5,000 people a year, Jamieson said, would be a grievous blow for local people and tourists. A woman sitting on a bench was waiting to pick up passengers arriving from Los Angeles for the Marfa film festival. Here, bus service to major cities is infrequent and indirect and the nearest commercial airports are three or four hours away. So the train is a valuable option, even if it does take 14 hours and 25 minutes to traverse the 596 miles from Alpine to Houston \u2013 five or six hours slower than in a car. \u201cThat\u2019s a long drive. Amtrak was just the perfect thing for me; you could sleep, you could read,\u201d said Chris Sweeney, 61, who spent two years commuting from Houston to Alpine by train. \u201cRiding trains, there\u2019s something kind of romantic about it. You get to see stuff you wouldn\u2019t see if you were flying or driving.\u201d Running three days a week, the Sunset Limited takes 48 hours to complete its 1,995-mile route between Los Angeles and New Orleans. It extended all the way to Orlando until damage from Hurricane Katrina curtailed the route to Florida, which was never restored. Along this path, Amtrak is an inconvenience to the lucrative and frequent freight services that barrel, horns booming, through Alpine every few minutes. Meanwhile, underlining the contrast in prospects between rural and urban areas, plans are advancing for a privately funded $15bn bullet train between Dallas and Houston. California is constructing a high-speed link to whisk travellers between Los Angeles and San Francisco in three hours or less. And Elon Musk is fantasising about 29-minute trips from New York to Washington. With wrangling over the transportation budget ongoing in Washington, campaigners received hopeful news this month when the House appropriations committee released a 2018 funding bill that included $1.4bn for Amtrak \u2013 coincidentally, the same amount Trump requested for initial construction of his border wall. But even if the Sunset Limited and other routes survive Trump\u2019s axe this time, supporters fear an annual battle to keep unprofitable long-distance train travel alive while lawmakers provide the bare minimum in financial support, causing a slow roll into the sidings: a lack of investment that leads to reduced reliability and declining passenger numbers. Bruce Ashton of Narp said Alpine was a symbol of \u201ca whole lot of the small communities that will be affected by the Trump cut\u201d. \u201cCities in Kansas, cities in Arkansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Colorado. All of these little, small towns, Alpine is representative of what they stand to lose.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There have been periods in the past in which the Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged for a long time. In 1719, official borrowing costs were raised from 4% to 5%, where they remained during the South Sea bubble, the seven years\u2019 war, the loss of the American colonies, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. In 1822, Seven years after the Battle of Waterloo, the Bank decided it was again time to act and reduced rates to their level of 103 years earlier. By comparison with their 18th and early 19th century forbears, the current crop of policymakers in Threadneedle Street are positively hasty. Rates were cut to 0.5% in March 2009 and left there for a mere seven-and-a-half years. A year ago, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, they were reduced to 0.25%. And there they are likely to stay. When the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee last met, three of the eight members said the post-referendum stimulus had done its work, making it possible to push rates back up to 0.5%. That caused a flurry of speculation that this week\u2019s MPC meeting would result in the first rate rise in more than a decade. It would be wise not to bet your mortgage on it. The case for an increase was never all that strong and is weaker than when the MPC last met in June. Growth has been sluggish in the first half of the year, running at an annualised rate of 1%. While above its 2% target, inflation unexpectedly fell in June to 2.6% and looks to be close to a peak. There are few signs that workers have been able to use the erosion of their living standards caused by the fall in the value of the pound to negotiate higher pay awards. Those advocating a rate rise say the Bank needs to give itself some room for manoeuvre in the event of there being another recession. The logic of this is not immediately obvious. Raising interest rates when the economy is struggling and consumer debt has been rising rapidly would risk triggering the recession the Bank is keen to avoid. Borrowing costs would go up only to come down again. It is the same story around the developed world. Central banks are uncomfortable with interest rates at historically low levels. They would like to sell back to the financial markets the bonds they bought in their quantitative easing programmes. But that\u2019s easier said than done. Only in the US have interest rates been increased, and even there, the Federal Reserve is moving at a snail\u2019s pace. The European Central Bank is not remotely close to tightening policy, nor is the Bank of Japan. Hope springs eternal. Since the financial crisis broke 10 years ago, policymakers have viewed the disruption as a temporary phenomenon. Growth would pick up. Productivity would rise. Inflationary pressure would increase. Interest rates would return to more normal levels. It hasn\u2019t happened. The first convulsions in the financial markets occurred on 9 August 2007 and a decade on, it is getting ever harder to see the crisis as a temporary phenomenon. Instead, the period before the crash now looks like the modern equivalent of the Edwardian summer before the outbreak of the first world war. The economic historian Angus Madison has produced figures for growth per head of population for western countries going back centuries. In the UK, GDP per head growth averaged 1.26% a year between 1820 and 1870, decelerated to 1.01% a year from 1870 to 1913, and then fell again to 0.92% in the period from 1913 to 1950 that included two world wars and the Great Depression. There was then a marked improvement to 2.44% a year in the period from 1950 to 1973, followed by a fresh decline to 1.79% in the quarter century from 1973 to 1998. Since the economy last peaked in early 2008, growth in GDP per head has averaged about 0.2% a year, in line with the performance of the economy between 1500 and 1820. The underlying performance of the UK economy is probably not quite as bad as that, but the trend has been poor enough for long enough to consider whether the really strong growth in the period after the second world war was the exception. There is plenty of supporting evidence for this notion. Economic growth in the G7 has been declining since the 1960s. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that potential per capita growth among its 34 rich-country members is 1% a year. The American economist Robert Gordon said only in one relatively brief period \u2013 1996 to 2004 \u2013 has US productivity matched the growth rates of the golden age after the second world war, and that was when IT transformed office work. By 2000, Gordon said, every office was equipped with web-linked personal computers that could do not just word processing, but download all sorts of information and perform calculations at high speed. By 2005, the transition to the modern office was complete with the arrival of flatscreens, but then the progress stopped. As in the UK, US productivity growth since the financial crisis has been slow. There will be profound implications if, and it remains an if, this is the new normal. For a start, growth oscillating around a 1% trend will result in more recessions. Inflationary pressure will be weak and deflationary episodes will be common. In the 19th century, there was no assumption that the cost of living would rise year in and year out: indeed, the price level was lower in 1914 than it had been in 1815. Weaker growth, in itself, would not necessarily be a bad thing. It might actually be a good thing if it meant less systematic damage being caused to the environment. Living standards in the developed world are already high, so does it really matter if they are increasing at 1% a year rather than 2% a year? The answer to that question depends on how the fruits of that growth are distributed. If they are apportioned so the neediest benefit the most, this would be one thing. If they go disproportionately to the 1%, while the other 99% have to accept flat living standards and deteriorating public services, this would create conditions ripe for social and political upheaval. Central banks have provided unprecedented amounts of stimulus in the past decade, but the payoff has been poor. That alone should raise serious doubts about whether there will ever be a return to the days when living standards doubled in a quarter of a century. Instead, we need to be prepared for a world in which there will be a bitter struggle over the meagre spoils of growth.",

      "body": "<p>There have been periods in the past in which the Bank of England has left interest rates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/13/interest-rates-uk-since-1694\">unchanged for a long time</a>. In 1719, official borrowing costs were raised from 4% to 5%, where they remained during the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thebubblebubble.com/south-sea-bubble/\">South Sea bubble</a>, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War\">seven years\u2019 war</a>, the loss of the American colonies, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. In 1822, Seven years after the Battle of Waterloo, the Bank decided it was again time to act and reduced rates to their level of 103 years earlier.</p> <p>By comparison with their 18th and early 19th century forbears, the current crop of policymakers in Threadneedle Street are positively hasty. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/05/interest-rates-quantitative-easing\">Rates were cut to 0.5%</a> in March 2009 and left there for a mere seven-and-a-half years. A year ago, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">they were reduced to 0.25%</a>. And there they are likely to stay. </p> <p>When the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee last met, three of the eight members said the post-referendum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/15/bank-of-england-uk-interest-rates-inflation\">stimulus had done its work,</a> making it possible to push rates back up to 0.5%. That caused a flurry of speculation that this week\u2019s MPC meeting would result in the first rate rise in more than a decade. It would be wise not to bet your mortgage on it. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The case for an increase was never all that strong and is weaker than when the MPC last met in June. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/26/uk-gdp-economy-grows-slowdown-manufacturing-construction-services\">Growth has been sluggish</a> in the first half of the year, running at an annualised rate of 1%. While above its 2% target, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/18/uk-inflation-falls-first-time-9-months-fuel-prices\">inflation unexpectedly fell in June</a> to 2.6% and looks to be close to a peak. There are few signs that workers have been able to use the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/22/brexit-economy-uk-slowdown-living-standards-costs\">erosion of their living standards</a> caused by the fall in the value of the pound to negotiate higher pay awards.</p> <p>Those advocating a rate rise say the Bank needs to give itself some room for manoeuvre in the event of there being another recession. The logic of this is not immediately obvious. Raising interest rates when the economy is struggling and consumer debt has been rising rapidly would risk triggering the recession the Bank is keen to avoid. Borrowing costs would go up only to come down again. </p> <p> It is the same story around the developed world. Central banks are uncomfortable with interest rates at historically low levels. They would like to sell back to the financial markets the bonds they bought in their quantitative easing programmes. But that\u2019s easier said than done. Only in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/14/federal-reserve-interest-rates-increase-us-economy\">have interest rates been increased</a>, and even there, the Federal Reserve is moving at a snail\u2019s pace. The European Central Bank is not remotely close to tightening policy, nor is the Bank of Japan. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Hope springs eternal. Since the financial crisis broke 10 years ago, policymakers have viewed the disruption as a temporary phenomenon. Growth would pick up. Productivity would rise. Inflationary pressure would increase. Interest rates would return to more normal levels.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t happened. The first convulsions in the financial markets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/01/credit-crunch-pinpointed-august-2007\">occurred on 9 August 2007</a> and a decade on, it is getting ever harder to see the crisis as a temporary phenomenon. Instead, the period before the crash now looks like the modern equivalent of the Edwardian summer before the outbreak of the first world war.</p> <p>The economic historian Angus Madison has produced figures for growth per head of population for western countries going back centuries. In the UK, GDP per head growth averaged 1.26% a year between 1820 and 1870, decelerated to 1.01% a year from 1870 to 1913, and then fell again to 0.92% in the period from 1913 to 1950 that included two world wars and the Great Depression. There was then a marked improvement to 2.44% a year in the period from 1950 to 1973, followed by a fresh decline to 1.79% in the quarter century from 1973 to 1998.</p> <p>Since the economy last peaked in early 2008, growth in GDP per head has averaged about 0.2% a year, in line with the performance of the economy between 1500 and 1820.</p> <p>The underlying performance of the UK economy is probably not quite as bad as that, but the trend has been poor enough for long enough to consider whether the really strong growth in the period after the second world war was the exception.</p> <p>There is plenty of supporting evidence for this notion.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jack Ma was destined to live an ordinary life. He failed the Chinese university entrance exam several times before being accepted by the worst school in Hangzhou, and he was rejected from a dozen jobs \u2013 even selling chicken at KFC. Ma was ready to settle into a quiet life as an English teacher in eastern China, a position with few advancement prospects, when, during a trip to Seattle in 1995 working as a translator for a trade delegation, everything changed. A friend showed Ma the internet. He placed a toe on to the information superhighway with a one-word search \u2013 \u201cbeer\u201d \u2013 and, two decades later, Ma is the richest man in Asia, head of an e-commerce and finance empire that includes Alibaba, one of the largest retailers in the world. Now Ma has once again set his sights on the US. In a high-profile meeting with Donald Trump before the inauguration, Ma promised to create 1m jobs in the US, and has wasted no time ingratiating himself into Trump\u2019s inner circle. He has dined alone with Ivanka Trump, and last week commerce secretary Wilbur Ross sat next to Ma at a meeting of US and Chinese businessmen. Those political connections may benefit him as he seeks to acquire American companies in a country that is increasingly wary of big Chinese investment. For Trump, the headlines of Ma\u2019s job-creating scheme may be more important that any actual jobs created. \u201cAs a merchant, it\u2019s about knowing your customer, and Trump doesn\u2019t care about anything that\u2019s not huge,\u201d says Duncan Clark, a longtime friend and author of Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built. \u201cHe figured a million is a good number to get Trump\u2019s attention. \u201cRealistically, without a major acquisition, I fail to see how that\u2019s possible,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn the US context, it\u2019s a very big number.\u201d For years, Ma has been pushing his vision of US small businesses selling to Chinese shoppers through his online marketplaces. He is often called the \u201cJeff Bezos of China\u201d, and there are clear similarities. Both built e-commerce empires and, like Bezos and the Washington Post, Ma even owns a an old established newspaper, in his case Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post. But there\u2019s a key difference: while Bezos\u2019s Amazon sells products to consumers, maintaining massive warehouses and operating a sophisticated logistics network, Alibaba\u2019s sites are simply a medium, connecting consumers with merchants who ship through independent couriers. This has led experts to say Alibaba\u2019s business model is closer to Google\u2019s than Amazon\u2019s. Alibaba\u2019s strength has always been solving inefficiencies, creating a website that allowed a host of businesses to sell directly to consumers during the infancy of the internet in China and starting an online payment system when it was cumbersome to wire funds. The company\u2019s flagship platforms, Taobao (similar to eBay) and Tmall (similar to Amazon), have created a one-stop shop for consumers, and Alibaba is exporting the model to emerging markets such as Russia and Brazil. But the US presents a new challenge, and e-commerce is already a crowded space. Alibaba may not have what it takes to spur massive job creation in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly unlikely target for job creation in any plausible time frame,\u201d said Christopher Balding, a professor of business and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC business school. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking 25 or 40 years, maybe Alibaba could create that many jobs.\u201d By comparison, WalMart, the largest private employer in the US, employs 1.5 million people. If Ma is able to deliver on his promise of 1m jobs, it would decrease the number of unemployed workers by a staggering 14%. Ma was born in the scenic city of Hangzhou in 1964, two years before the start of the Cultural Revolution, a decade of political upheaval that saw his parents and grandfather persecuted by elements of the ruling Communist party. His father beat him, according to a 2013 biography, but Ma found his escape in teaching himself English. From the age of 12, Ma would cycle for 40 minutes to the city\u2019s hotels to offer foreign tourists his services as a guide around the West Lake so that he could practise his English. \u201cThe west was his lifeline in a land where he wasn\u2019t on the elite track,\u201d says Duncan Clark. \u201cHe struggled in school, he\u2019s not an engineer, he\u2019s not a technical guy, so he became an English teacher.\u201d Ma\u2019s ability to read an audience, though, is on a par with a standup comedian, Clark adds, and some have described his charisma as \u201cJack Magic\u201d. That charm is increasingly being directed at Trump administration officials. But beyond the million-jobs propaganda story, Ma is working to convince the US government that his intentions are innocuous as he makes a $1.2bn bid for MoneyGram, the second largest remittance firm in the US in a deal that has raised national-security concerns. \u201cHis repeat performances with Trump and his administration show he is making significant inroads,\u201d says Michael Wessel, head of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a oversight body that reports to Congress. \u201cMa isn\u2019t interested in America succeeding, he\u2019s interested in Ma, Alibaba and China succeeding. As a skilled, global businessman, Ma is operating in his own interest which, at times, might also be the interests of the Chinese Communist party. That has to be considered whenever he acts.\u201d The MoneyGram deal has attracted significant opposition from lawmakers in Washington, hinging on the fact that a large number of military families use the company to transfer money. The purchase is yet to be approved by US regulators in a process that could see the matter decided by Trump. Last year, Alibaba admitted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the accounting practices of its logistics network and its huge Singles\u2019 Day online shopping event \u2013 it\u2019s like Black Friday but much, much bigger \u2013 a matter that has yet to be resolved. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Ma chastised the US, saying that while America benefited from globalisation, it was squandering trillions of dollars on foreign wars and neglecting the country\u2019s infrastructure and its own citizens. Back in China, Ma\u2019s ties to the government have been invaluable. At a time when Chinese president Xi Jinping is signalling that companies should rein in overseas purchases, Ma\u2019s continuing push in the US is a clear sign of his political clout. And in 2014, when China\u2019s state administration for industry and commerce published findings showing that more than 70% of goods in a random sample on Taobao were fake, Ma met with the head of the agency, who subsequently claimed that the report was merely the minutes of a meeting and \u201chad no legal effect\u201d. While Ma hopes to encourage American small businesses to sell on the company\u2019s high-end marketplace, Tmall, in December 2016 the US government put its much larger sister site, Taobao, on a blacklist of \u201cnotorious marketplaces\u201d known for the sale of counterfeit goods and violations of intellectual property rights . The blacklisting was not the first setback for Alibaba. The company was burned on its first attempts to expand into the US when, shortly after founding the company, Ma was forced to shut down an office it opened just outside San Francisco after less than a year. Another venture \u2013 an online shopping site like Amazon called 11 main \u2013 was shuttered in 2015. Despite these hurdles, Ma is pushing on with his dream for US businesses to sell to China through his websites. In June, Alibaba hosted a conference, Gateway, in Detroit, which was aimed at bringing more small firms into its ecosystem. One of the speakers, something of a poster child for Alibaba, was Sam Wolf, who turned his family\u2019s vitamin store in suburban Philadelphia into an online giant selling 40,000 products around the world. His company, LuckyVitamin, started selling on Tmall in November and Wolf estimates he has hired about 20 employees since then, though only a fraction deal with China directly, with most working in inventory or accounting. But when LuckyVitamin began selling in China, it already had the experience of expanding into more than 30 countries around the world, and Wolf warned that opening a shop on Tmall was the most challenging. \u201cSelling on Tmall is like starting a new business, as opposed to simply adding a new channel for sales,\u201d Wolf says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a light switch, it\u2019s not a get-rich-quick opportunity where you can just double your business overnight by opening the door to China. It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. Anybody who comes to Tmall with get-rich-quick aspirations is going to be disappointed.\u201d Along with LuckyVitamin, Ma has convinced a handful of other businesses to sell through his websites. To fulfil his promise of 1m jobs, he needs more than 50,000 companies to replicate Wolf\u2019s success in the next few years. By then, or course, Trump will likely have moved on to his next pet project, and Ma, the English teacher turned tech billionaire, will have greased the wheels in the world\u2019s two largest economies.

The company\u2019s flagship platforms, Taobao (similar to eBay) and Tmall (similar to Amazon), have created a one-stop shop for consumers, and Alibaba is exporting the model to emerging markets such as Russia and&#xa0;Brazil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87e56405a8f388be0f843817999de3aa925566bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87e56405a8f388be0f843817999de3aa925566bf/422_66_3306_2202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Ma with Donald Trump, January 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Ma with Donald Trump, January 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the US presents a new challenge, and e-commerce is already a crowded space. Alibaba may not have what it takes to spur massive job creation in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly unlikely target for job creation in any plausible time frame,\u201d said Christopher Balding, a professor of business and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC business school. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking 25 or 40 years, maybe Alibaba could create that many jobs.\u201d</p> <p>By comparison, WalMart, the largest private employer in the US, <a href=\"http://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/company-facts\" title=\"\">employs 1.5 million people</a>. If Ma is able to deliver on his promise of 1m jobs, it would decrease the number of <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\" title=\"\">unemployed workers</a> by a staggering 14%.</p> <p>Ma was born in the scenic city of Hangzhou in 1964, two years before the start of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/the-cultural-revolution-50-years-on-all-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-political-convulsion\" title=\"\">Cultural Revolution</a>, a decade of political upheaval that saw his parents and grandfather persecuted by elements of the ruling Communist party. His father beat him, according to a 2013 biography, but Ma found his escape in teaching himself English. From the age of 12, Ma would cycle for 40 minutes to the city\u2019s hotels to offer foreign tourists his services as a guide around the West Lake so that he could practise his&#xa0;English.</p> <p>\u201cThe west was his lifeline in a land where he wasn\u2019t on the elite track,\u201d says Duncan Clark. \u201cHe struggled in school, he\u2019s not an engineer, he\u2019s not a technical guy, so he became an English teacher.\u201d Ma\u2019s ability to read an audience, though, is on a par with a standup comedian, Clark adds, and some have described his charisma as \u201cJack Magic\u201d.</p> <p>That charm is increasingly being directed at Trump administration officials. But beyond the million-jobs propaganda story, Ma is working to convince the US government that his intentions are innocuous as he makes <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ant-financial-increases-bid-for-moneygram-1492402252\" title=\"\">a $1.2bn bid for MoneyGram</a>, the <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-five-best-remittance-companies-in-the-world-2016-7\" title=\"\">second largest remittance firm in the US</a> in a deal that has raised national-security&#xa0;concerns.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Government findings showed that more than 70% of goods in a random sample on Taobao were fake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHis repeat performances with Trump and his administration show he is making significant inroads,\u201d says Michael Wessel, head of the <a href=\"https://www.uscc.gov/about\" title=\"\">US-China Economic and Security Review Commission</a>, a oversight body that reports to Congress. \u201cMa isn\u2019t interested in America succeeding, he\u2019s interested in Ma, Alibaba and China succeeding. As a skilled, global businessman, Ma is operating in his own interest which, at times, might also be the interests of the Chinese Communist party. That has to be considered whenever he acts.\u201d</p> <p>The MoneyGram deal has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/07/19/chinas-jack-ma-has-penetrated-the-trump-administration-and-he-knows-what-he-wants/?utm_term=.a5c41c652d52\" title=\"\">attracted significant opposition</a> from lawmakers in Washington, hinging on the fact that a large number of military families use the company to transfer money. The purchase is yet to be approved by US regulators in a process that could see the matter decided by Trump.</p> <p>Last year, Alibaba admitted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the accounting practices of its logistics network and its huge Singles\u2019 Day online shopping event \u2013 it\u2019s like Black Friday but much, much bigger \u2013 a matter that has yet to be resolved.</p> <p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/jack-ma-america-has-wasted-its-wealth/\" title=\"\">Ma chastised the US</a>, saying that while America benefited from globalisation, it was squandering trillions of dollars on foreign wars and neglecting the country\u2019s infrastructure and its own citizens.</p> <p>Back in China, Ma\u2019s ties to the government have been invaluable. At a time when Chinese president Xi Jinping is signalling that companies should rein in overseas purchases, Ma\u2019s continuing push in the US is a clear sign of his political clout. And in 2014, when China\u2019s state administration for industry and commerce published findings showing that more than 70% of goods in a random sample <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/28/alibaba-defies-chinese-authorities-critical-report-trading-practices\" title=\"\">on Taobao were fake</a>, Ma met with the head of the agency, who subsequently claimed that the report was merely the minutes of a meeting and \u201chad no legal effect\u201d.</p> <p>While Ma hopes to encourage American small businesses to sell on the company\u2019s high-end marketplace, Tmall, in December 2016 the US government put its much larger sister site, Taobao, on a blacklist of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelzakkour/2016/12/22/u-s-agency-puts-alibaba-back-on-notorious-markets-list-heres-why-theyre-wrong/#1dde99df5df7\" title=\"\">\u201cnotorious marketplaces\u201d</a> known for the sale of counterfeit goods and violations of intellectual property&#xa0;rights .</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ab5de911cfbe9ab3725a2d51f87abb650bf76f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ab5de911cfbe9ab3725a2d51f87abb650bf76f3/0_0_961_1281/750.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Ma Newsweek magazine cover\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The blacklisting was not the first setback for Alibaba. The company was burned on its first attempts to expand into the US when, shortly after founding the company, Ma was forced to shut down an office it opened just outside San Francisco after less than a year. Another venture \u2013 an <a href=\"https://qz.com/434600/alibaba-has-closed-down-11-main-its-us-based-amazon-competitor-one-year-after-launch/\" title=\"\">online shopping site</a> like Amazon called 11 main \u2013 was shuttered in 2015.</p> <p>Despite these hurdles, Ma is pushing on with his dream for US businesses to sell to China through his websites. In June, Alibaba hosted a conference, Gateway, in Detroit, which was aimed at bringing more small firms into its ecosystem. One of the speakers, something of a poster child for Alibaba, was Sam Wolf, who turned his family\u2019s vitamin store in suburban Philadelphia into an online giant selling 40,000 products around the world. His company, LuckyVitamin, started selling on Tmall in November and Wolf estimates he has hired about 20 employees since then, though only a fraction deal with China directly, with most working in inventory or&#xa0;accounting.</p> <p>But when LuckyVitamin began selling in China, it already had the experience of expanding into more than 30 countries around the world, and Wolf warned that opening a shop on Tmall was the most challenging.</p> <p>\u201cSelling on Tmall is like starting a new business, as opposed to simply adding a new channel for sales,\u201d Wolf says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a light switch, it\u2019s not a get-rich-quick opportunity where you can just double your business overnight by opening the door to China. It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. Anybody who comes to Tmall with get-rich-quick aspirations is going to be disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>Along with LuckyVitamin, Ma has convinced a handful of other businesses to sell through his websites. To fulfil his promise of 1m jobs, he needs more than 50,000 companies to replicate Wolf\u2019s success in the next few years.</p> <p>By then, or course, Trump will likely have moved on to his next pet project, and Ma, the English teacher turned tech billionaire, will have greased the wheels in the world\u2019s two largest economies.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Wang Zhen</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The French economy is growing at the same pace the UK managed in 2016 and looks set to maintain it for the rest of the year. Growth for the second quarter was 0.5% and 1.8% over the past year. Meanwhile the UK is shuffling along in the slow lane, up just 0.3% between April and June. Does the reversal of fortunes tell us that France has found its mojo while the UK has done worse than let its foot slip off the accelerator? There is certainly a swagger to president Emmanuel Macron as he surveys a scene his predecessor Fran\u00e7ois Hollande dreamed about. Consistent growth is something that has eluded the French ever since the financial crash, as one false start after another robbed the economy of whatever momentum it had. With Greek bankruptcy averted and the refugee crisis contained, at least in the view of the Brussels bureaucrats, France can grow again without hindrance while Germany and Spain maintain their stellar record of expansion. Italy may still be struggling, but now that its banks, like Greece\u2019s, are shored up with extra government cash, its ailing finances are to some extent ringfenced. France is in the clear. To emphasise the point, unemployment is now at its lowest since the eurozone crisis, inflation is under control, and business surveys reveal the best confidence levels in a decade. Most importantly, exports jumped 3.1% \u2013 after a 0.7% contraction in the previous quarter \u2013 and household spending growth inched up slightly to 0.3% in the latest quarter, from 0.1%. But few analysts in the French financial services industry think the surge is more than a cyclical rebound. The return of business confidence follows Macron\u2019s election, the absence of financial disasters inside the EU and the cheap money flowing out of the European Central Bank, which is having the same effect now on France that the Bank of England\u2019s quantitative easing had on the UK economy in 2013. A structural recovery is one based on sustained increases in investment \u2013 public and private \u2013 and improvements in productivity that propel wages growth and higher standards of living for all. Macron expects that a mix of neo-liberal supply-side reforms to a labour market dominated by union rules, and an attack on cosy business practices allied to directives from the Elys\u00e9e Palace to reform the public sector, will bring about the mix of policies needed to achieve this aim. But all his talk of industrial strategies is much like Theresa May\u2019s \u2013 empty when he has little money to spend and French businesses, much like their British counterparts, are unwilling to invest. That means France will continue to rely, as the British economy does, on armies of young people working for low pay on short-term contracts to keep the wheels turning. There is a silver lining, however. In the three months ending in May, world trade in goods grew by 5.1%, almost back to the growth rates seen prior to the financial crisis (the average rate then was 6.7%). While Britain is hampered by Brexit uncertainty, France has the capacity to join Germany in exporting more of its high-grade machine tools, pharmaceuticals, aeroplanes and lorries to emerging markets. France has hung on to less of its industrial heritage than Germany, but has apprenticeship schemes and polytechnical educational establishments that put Britain\u2019s to shame. Rebuilding the UK\u2019s technical skills after four decades of decline will take some time. Further education colleges are on their knees and, to shore up their finances, universities are looking abroad for students even more than usual. The Brexit dividend of homegrown talent that will foster growth looks like a mirage to anyone in the education business. That leaves Macron in a position where he only needs to achieve a fraction of the reforms he has planned for France to accelerate out of trouble, leaving the UK in its wake. In the end, Virgin couldn\u2019t fly solo Thursday was \u201can exciting day\u201d for Virgin Atlantic, Sir Richard Branson wrote to his staff, as the airline\u2019s founder sold the bulk of his shareholding to Air France-KLM and left Delta with the biggest stake. But there were elegiac notes in the letter, recalling the decades when his airline was pitched as the upstart, punching above its weight. Now, Virgin has firmly sided with the big boys, and Branson can no longer control its destiny. Staff may be less than reassured by Branson promise that the Virgin Atlantic brand would live on. The Atlantic suffix is apt: the airline has flown more and more on established routes to the US since the first Delta hook-up in 2012. But Virgin\u2019s wings have been clipped, with riskier routes to Africa and Asia cut back. To exit with \u00a3220m from Air France-KLM tucked away is an honourable retreat for an ageing knight. Airlines have had a good three or four years on the back of low oil prices, but the days of wafer-thin margins and teetering businesses are never far away. Virgin\u2019s own return to profit is now menaced by Brexit and the falling pound. Branson claimed to have proved Willie Walsh wrong. The chief executive of British Airways parent IAG said in 2012 that the Virgin Atlantic brand was likely to disappear if Delta took control. Branson may yet emerge technically victorious, but Walsh\u2019s prognosis that smaller airlines would be swallowed up looks prescient. This deal was hastened partly because of the travails of another partner of Delta and Air France-KLM: national carrier Alitalia, perennially kept on life support by Rome. Where full mergers are blocked by foreign ownership rules, joint ventures on lucrative routes, such as British Airways\u2019 tie-up with American, have become the strategic alternative. But where permitted, consolidation has been the story: the US \u201cbig four\u201d are the prime example. Although Virgin traditionally prized its independence, Branson has also concluded that it was now time to join forces. Farewell to Libor RIP Libor. The interest rate benchmark linked to a series of bank scandals is to be phased out in 2021, Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, has announced. There have been various attempts to reform the index, used to price more than $350 trillion of financial products around the world, after it emerged that banks had been manipulating the rate. But as Bailey admitted last week, banks no longer want to participate in the setting of Libor \u2013 the London interbank offered rate. Regulators did not \u201csuspect further wrongdoing or have any evidence of such\u201d, he insisted. But it certainly feels like the right time to retire a rate that has taken on toxic connotations in the wake of the financial crisis. Now the search starts for an alternative. So it\u2019s a good job the regulators have given themselves five years to come up with something that will be a lot less prone to manipulation than Libor of old.",

It happened to Winston either side of the second world war and, in his own sphere, grandson Rupert Soames looks to be receiving some similar treatment. Soames, of course, runs the embattled outsourcing giant Serco \u2013 which many think would not now exist had he not come to save it during many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. \u201cSome of the best civil servants are moving to work on Brexit negotiations,\u201d Remainer Soames told the Evening Standard last year, as he outlined why Brexit might inspire a boom in supplying the UK government with its services. \u201cThe government is going to need help to get stuff done.\u201d And yet HM government does not yet seem to have concluded that that assistance should be provided by Serco. As the group prepares to address the City at the group\u2019s interim results this week, analysts at investment bank Jefferies reckon the firm has a \u201cmixed bid pipeline\u201d as \u201cdecisions are drifting in an unhelpful political environment\u201d. If that feels like Soames is being kept waiting, then at least there is a trace of solace in the family history. Grandpa was kept waiting by the government in the 1930s \u2013 and then by the great British electorate in 1945. Both called (eventually). ConvaTec\u2019s male problem needs a cure A year ago, very few people had ever heard of the medical products group ConvaTec, even folk in the City who pretend to follow these things. That changed when the company floated last autumn and was quickly promoted into the FTSE 100. The shares are now soaring 36% above the float price, the group has made a couple of subsequent acquisitions, and we will get to hear more about its largely effortless progress as a public company this week, when it announces results. Effortless save for one area, that is. The maker of medical products such as colostomy bags has come under fire for its lack of gender balance, as it is the sole FTSE 100 member to possess an all-male board. So much so that even those the City who ignore these things when shares are rising began to wonder if the catheter supplier was metaphorically extracting the urine. No longer. Ros Rivaz was announced as the firm\u2019s first female director last month and chairman Sir Christopher Gent has said the board \u201cwill in time reflect the requirements for gender diversity\u201d. A female-only shortlist for a second board vacancy is promised. Developing \u2026 Shock as RBS results \u2018might be all right\u2019 Royal Bank of Scotland is the most British of institutions. Like the country as a whole, the (largely) state-owned bank once bestrode the globe, before a changing international scene, coupled with the odd piece of comic incompetence, took both institutions down a peg or 10. Nowadays, we are all thankful if either avoids total embarrassment on the world stage. Which brings us to the banking reporting season and RBS\u2019s interim results this week, which, in a bout of unusual optimism, the City seems to think won\u2019t be a complete humiliation. Analysts at Credit Suisse headline their preview with the prediction \u201cshould be OK\u201d \u2013 which on recent form would constitute a triumph. Still, the subtext will really be whether the government starts selling down its RBS stake, now the bank no longer has to offload Williams &amp; Glyn and (many of) its US woes are history. Meanwhile another disgraced UK bank, HSBC, also reports numbers this week \u2013 and despite attracting bad publicity like RBS recently (money laundering, Swiss banking etc etc), the word is that the bank is throwing off so much cash that investors wonder if HSBC might do something with it. History suggests nothing could possibly go wrong.",
