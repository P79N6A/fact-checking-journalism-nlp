      "bodyText": "The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 800 points, its worst drop in eight months, led by sharp declines in technology stocks. The sharp sell-off was even starker at the tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange, home to Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and others. The Nasdaq fell over 4%. Wednesday marked the fifth consecutive daily decline for the S&amp;P 500, the longest losing streak since November 2016. Just a week ago stock markets set another record high, a fact that was trumpeted by Donald Trump. But after years of growth, investors appear to be spooked by rising bond yields that have been drawing some out of the stock market. Fears of further falls led others to sell their holdings. The best-performing stocks over the past year \u2013 which include the so-called Faang companies of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2013 took some of the biggest losses Wednesday. Amazon lost 6.2% and Netflix gave back 8.4%. Fears of escalating tensions with China over trade also contributed to the fall. On Monday the International Monetary Fund warned that the US\u2019s increasingly protectionist trade policies would hit global growth. Trump blamed the slide on the policies of the Fed, which has raised rates three times this year. In comments before a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, the president said: \u201cI think the Fed has gone crazy.\u201d Investors in Asia Pacific were braced for heavy losses when trading begins in the region on Thursday. The benchmark ASX200 index was down 123 points, or 2%, in early tarde in Sydney. The Nikkei in Tokyo was expected to open down 3%. market was expected to fall 3%. Gina Martin Adams, the chief equity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, said investors are concerned about the big increase in bond yields, which makes it more expensive to borrow money. She said they also fear that company profit margins will be squeezed by rising costs, including the price of oil. Insurance companies also dropped as Hurricane Michael continued to gather strength and came ashore in Florida bringing winds of up to 155mph. Berkshire Hathaway dipped 4.1% to $214.64 and reinsurer Everest Re slid 4.6% to $218.97. The biggest driver for the market over the last week has been interest rates, which began spurting higher following several encouraging reports on the economy. Higher rates can slow economic growth, erode corporate profits and make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a blood bath,\u201d said Ed Campbell, senior portfolio manager at QMA, the asset management branch of Prudential Financial. \u201cIt\u2019s primarily the cumulative effect of interest rate moves over the past five days and news reports about trade impacting companies.\u201d The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.22% from 3.20% late Tuesday after earlier touching 3.24%. It was at just 3.05% early last week. Technology and internet-based companies are known for their high profit margins, and many have reported explosive growth in recent years, with corresponding gains in their stock prices. Adams, of Bloomberg Intelligence, said investors have concerns about their future profitability, too. That has helped make technology stocks more volatile in the last few months. \u201cAs stocks go up, tech goes up more than the stock market. As stocks go down, tech goes down more than the stock market,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Brexit uncertainty has crushed confidence in the property market, according to the official surveyors\u2019 body, with buyers evaporating, prices falling and sales taking a record amount of time to complete. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said the time taken to complete a property sale has widened to 19 weeks, the longest duration since it began collecting data. It said the downward pressure on prices in London had spread out of the capital, and that \u201cthe already negative readings for the south-east and East Anglia deteriorated a little further in September\u201d. Surveyors across London and the south-east who took part in the RICS research were almost unanimous in blaming Brexit. Simon Barker, a surveyor at the estate agency Knight Frank, said: \u201cA no-deal Brexit will be a disaster for the property market.\u201d. Michael Brooker, a surveyor and estate agent in Crowborough, East Sussex, said: \u201cThe Brexit effect is really depressing the sales market.\u201d RICS measures sentiment in the property market rather than prices, and said that the net balance had fallen to -2% from +1% in August. It said its measure of inquiries from buyers fell to -11% from -9% the previous month. Appraisals by surveyors before properties go on the market have slumped dramatically. \u201cThe level of appraisals being undertaken remains down on an annual comparison, with the net balance sitting at -20%. As such, there is nothing from this indicator to suggest a pick-up in sales listings is imminent,\u201d said RICS. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, said: \u201cThere are a number of themes running through the comments of respondents this month, but uncertainty relating to Brexit negotiations is at the very top of the list followed by references to the confidential remarks made by the Bank of England governor to the cabinet. All of this is, not surprisingly, taking its toll on the sales market.\u201d But outside of the south, Brexit uncertainty is having less of an impact. \u201cHouse prices continue to rise firmly across much of the UK, with the West Midlands, Northern Ireland and Scotland posting the strongest growth,\u201d said RICS. Northern Ireland currently has the most vibrant property market in the UK, despite the fact that the border with the Irish Republic remains the thorniest issue for Brexit negotiators, and the province is without a government in Stormont. \u201cThe market has continued to be strong despite the dreaded word Brexit,\u201d said Kirby O\u2019Connor of the Belfast estate agents GOC. The rental market across the UK has bucked the trend in the sales market, with demand rising for the fourth successive month, said RICS. It said that with new instructions from landlords down and tenant demand up, rents were likely to rise by about 2% this year and accelerate to 3.5% a year over the next five years, outstripping projected pay rises. The RICS figures come just weeks after Halifax revealed that house prices had tumbled at the fastest pace for almost six months, and that the number of homes for sale had fallen to a decade low. Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender said the average price of a home in Britain had dropped to \u00a3225,995 last month, down 1.4% from the level recorded in August. The price of a home remained 2.5% higher than a year ago.",

      "bodyText": "WeWork, according to the founders\u2019 blurb, is \u201ca place you join as an individual, \u2018me\u2019, but where you become part of a greater \u2018we\u2019. A place where we\u2019re redefining success measured by personal fulfilment, not just the bottom line.\u201d Very uplifting, but you\u2019d probably think twice before investing. Funky murals and cheese-tasting events for tenants are eye-catching but, in the end, WeWork is a provider of office space on short-term leases, which is a notoriously cyclical game. And, despite opening offices in more than 70 cities around the world, WeWork currently makes substantial losses. However, SoftBank of Japan, one of the world\u2019s biggest and most adventurous investors, is keen to throw serious sums at the company. It has already invested $4.4bn and, according to reports, is lining up another $10bn or $20bn. Softbank\u2019s co-traveller is Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund via the duo\u2019s enormous $100bn Vision Fund, which aims to make big bets on businesses of tomorrow. You certainly need to be a visionary of some kind to see how WeWork could possibly be worth the implied valuation of about $40bn. Losses more than quadrupled in the first half of this year to $723m. Even if you prefer to concentrate on revenues, and overlook the costs of rapid expansion, it\u2019s hard to make sense of it. Revenues will still only be $2.3bn at the end of this year, said the company in August, and that was on a flattering \u201crun rate\u201d, or annualised, basis. SoftBank\u2019s founder, Masayoshi Son, made one of the great investments when he backed Alibaba, the Chinese online retailer, in its early days, so his record can\u2019t be ignored. But the punt on WeWork looks bizarre. Old-hand property experts point to the fundamental risk of taking on long leases on big buildings and offering tenants short, flexible rents. In a downturn, they argue, the fixed costs will remain but income will be vulnerable. It seems a reasonable point. Indeed, it is one reason why the UK group IWG, which has been offering short-term office space for 30 years, is valued at only \u00a32bn, despite making real profits and having more revenue than its US competitor. Its investors know that this corner of the property world is cyclical. What\u2019s more, the space is being crowded as the overhyped rise of WeWork spawns imitators at a furious pace. WeWork is a bubble, surely. Luke Johnson must be choking on his Patisserie Valerie \u00e9clair If you prefer your business pundits to have firsthand business experience, Luke Johnson is your man. He\u2019s a punchy writer who shares wisdom learned from his years at Pizza Express and elsewhere. One of last month\u2019s columns in the Sunday Times was excellent \u2013 \u201can aide-memoire for those looking to spot the next fraud\u201d. Identifying swindles is not so difficult, apparently, because \u201cmany of the same tricks were played 50 or even 100 years ago\u201d. Now \u2013 with cruel timing \u2013 the owner of Patisserie Valerie, a company where Johnson is executive chairman and owns a 37% stake, has caused co-investors to choke on their mille-feuille. The board \u201chas been notified of significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities.\u201d Chris Marsh, the chief financial officer who joined with the Johnson-led buyout in 2006, has been suspended from duties. Johnson is leading the investigation. By lunchtime on Wednesday, he revealed that a winding-up petition had been filed in the high court against the group\u2019s main trading subsidiary four weeks ago. It was not explained how the board could previously have missed this information. Beyond that, Patisserie Holdings isn\u2019t saying much. But, if the size of the accounting irregularities is \u00a320m, it\u2019s a mighty mouthful. The sum is equivalent to last year\u2019s entire pre-tax profits. Alternatively, it represents about eight years\u2019 worth of dividends at last year\u2019s payout ratio. The only safe bet is that Patisserie won\u2019t be valued at \u00a3450m if and when trading in the shares resumes. Still, it\u2019s all useful material for future columns. Johnson could expand on a thought in another recent dispatch: \u201cMost of us think we know more than we do.\u201d Trade unions should recruit outside traditional industries It\u2019s hardly fresh news that unionised workers tend to be able to secure higher wages, but it\u2019s still remarkable to see some hard numbers, courtesy of the chief economist of the Bank of England. The premium has been found to lie in the range of 10%-15%, says Andy Haldane. And the effect of falling levels of union membership has been to lower wage growth by 0.75 percentage points per year over the past 30 years. You could view these statistics as valuable recruiting material for trade unions. That\u2019s certainly the case. But union leaders should also look in the mirror. Their own failure to expand outside traditional industries is also part of the tale. There are signs of improvement \u2013 but too few.",

      "body": "<p>WeWork, according to the founders\u2019 blurb, is \u201ca place you join as an individual, \u2018me\u2019, but where you become part of a greater \u2018we\u2019. A place where we\u2019re redefining success measured by personal fulfilment, not just the bottom line.\u201d Very uplifting, but you\u2019d probably think twice before investing. Funky murals and cheese-tasting events for tenants are eye-catching but, in the end, WeWork is a provider of office space on short-term leases, which is a notoriously cyclical game. And, despite opening offices in more than 70 cities around the world, WeWork currently makes substantial losses.</p> <p>However, SoftBank of Japan, one of the world\u2019s biggest and most adventurous investors, is keen to throw serious sums at the company. It has already invested $4.4bn and, according to reports, is lining up another $10bn or $20bn. Softbank\u2019s co-traveller is Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund via the duo\u2019s enormous $100bn Vision Fund, which aims to make big bets on businesses of tomorrow.</p> <p>You certainly need to be a visionary of some kind to see how WeWork could possibly be worth the implied valuation of about $40bn. Losses more than quadrupled in the first half of this year to $723m. Even if you prefer to concentrate on revenues, and overlook the costs of rapid expansion, it\u2019s hard to make sense of it. Revenues will still only be $2.3bn at the end of this year, said the company in August, and that was on a flattering \u201crun rate\u201d, or annualised, basis.</p> <p>SoftBank\u2019s founder, Masayoshi Son, made one of the great investments when he backed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/alibaba\">Alibaba</a>, the Chinese online retailer, in its early days, so his record can\u2019t be ignored. But the punt on WeWork looks bizarre. Old-hand property experts point to the fundamental risk of taking on long leases on big buildings and offering tenants short, flexible rents. In a downturn, they argue, the fixed costs will remain but income will be vulnerable. It seems a reasonable point.</p> <p>Indeed, it is one reason why the UK group IWG, which has been offering short-term office space for 30 years, is valued at only \u00a32bn, despite making real profits and having more revenue than its US competitor. Its investors know that this corner of the property world is cyclical. What\u2019s more, the space is being crowded as the overhyped rise of WeWork spawns imitators at a furious pace. WeWork is a bubble, surely.</p> <h2>Luke Johnson must be choking on his Patisserie Valerie \u00e9clair</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4430a77a2955fc6363782c2b132acba48e7213bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4430a77a2955fc6363782c2b132acba48e7213bc/150_41_3623_2174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke Johnson, executive chairman of Patisserie Valerie, at a branch in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Williams/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you prefer your business pundits to have firsthand business experience, Luke Johnson is your man.

Identifying swindles is not so difficult, apparently, because \u201cmany of the same tricks were played 50 or even 100 years ago\u201d.</p> <p>Now \u2013 with cruel timing \u2013 the owner of Patisserie Valerie, a company where Johnson is executive chairman and owns a 37% stake, has caused co-investors to choke on their mille-feuille. The board <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/10/patisserie-valerie-shares-suspended-over-accounting-black-hole\">\u201chas been notified of significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities.\u201d</a></p> <p>Chris Marsh, the chief financial officer who joined with the Johnson-led buyout in 2006, has been suspended from duties. Johnson is leading the investigation. By lunchtime on Wednesday, he revealed that a winding-up petition had been filed in the high court against the group\u2019s main trading subsidiary four weeks ago. It was not explained how the board could previously have missed this information.</p> <p>Beyond that, Patisserie Holdings isn\u2019t saying much. But, if the size of the accounting irregularities is \u00a320m, it\u2019s a mighty mouthful. The sum is equivalent to last year\u2019s entire pre-tax profits. Alternatively, it represents about eight years\u2019 worth of dividends at last year\u2019s payout ratio. The only safe bet is that Patisserie won\u2019t be valued at \u00a3450m if and when trading in the shares resumes.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s all useful material for future columns. Johnson could expand on a thought in another recent dispatch: \u201cMost of us think we know more than we do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/09/uber-uk-strike-users-urged-not-to-cross-digital-picket-line\">Uber UK strike: users urged not to cross 'digital picket line'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Trade unions should recruit outside traditional industries</h2> <p>It\u2019s hardly fresh news that unionised workers tend to be able to secure higher wages, but it\u2019s still remarkable to see some hard numbers, courtesy of the chief economist of the Bank of England.

      "bodyText": "The UK economy ground to a halt in August, according to official figures that suggest a slowdown in growth after the World Cup. The Office for National Statistics said the rate of GDP growth in August dropped to 0% from 0.4% in July, missing City economists\u2019 forecasts of 0.1%. Analysts said momentum in the UK economy was fading after robust growth earlier in the summer, when hot weather and the World Cup tempted consumers to spend more money. They also warned that the weak August reading could serve as a warning signal for weaker economic growth in the months ahead, amid mounting concerns over the risks from a no-deal Brexit. Despite the weaker performance in August, the rolling three-monthly GDP figure revealed the strongest growth in almost two years, with 0.7% across the three months. The ONS says monthly readings of GDP can prove volatile, with the potential to change significantly from one month to the next. Some economists, however, said the August figure may have revealed underlying weaknesses in the economy. \u201cIt seems that the World Cup may have encouraged spending during July, but the party ended abruptly the following month,\u201d said Azad Zangana, senior economist at the fund manager Schroders. \u201cIt could also be in response to the rise in fear over a no-deal or cliff edge Brexit \u2026 If the slowdown is Brexit-related, then it is likely to have persisted through September, and could potentially last for a few more months yet,\u201d he added. The latest snapshot for UK growth showed that the stagnation in August was across much of the economy, with only a modest improvement in the rate of output in the industrial sector thanks to mining and quarrying activity. The services sector, which accounts for more than four-fifths of the economy, flatlined, recording zero growth. Manufacturing output slid by 0.2%, while construction output dropped 0.7%. Some economists said August could be a blip; earlier this year the UK economy ground to a halt amid freezing weather, before rebounding. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said it expected the UK economy would expand by 0.7% in the third quarter of 2018 and by 0.5% in the final three months of the year, pointing to economic growth for the year as a whole of about 1.5%. John Hawksworth, chief economist at the accountancy group PricewaterhouseCoopers, said growth of around 1.5% a year was still below the pre-Brexit vote trend about 2%, with the mounting risk of a no-deal departure from the EU continuing to drag on activity. \u201cThis seems likely to continue into the fourth quarter of 2018, when we expect some moderation of UK growth [amid Brexit uncertainty],\u201d he added. The ONS update came after the International Monetary Fund downgraded UK growth forecasts for this year. The global lender of last resort expects a growth rate of 1.1%, down from 1.3%, as Brexit uncertainty weighs more heavily on trade and investment.",

      "bodyText": "Alan Tudge, the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, on Tuesday repeated a suggestion that migrants might be forced to live in regions or cities other than Melbourne and Sydney. His proposal was first mooted in August and the lack of any further details or specifics in the latest iteration suggest the policy is more about talking than acting. That is just as well, because the driver of migration destination remains not government penalties or even incentives, but jobs. I grew up in country South Australia and, like most of my school friends, as soon as I finished high school, I left. I finished university in the early 1990s at a time when the recession was so deep that in South Australia there were 48 unemployed for every job vacancy (currently there are four unemployed per vacancy). So, like many others of my age, I left the state. I lived in far north Queensland for a decade and then moved to Canberra after getting a job there in the public service. My story is not all that unusual, and it goes to the problems governments both federal and state have with migration and population. I, like most people, moved to where there was work. It wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise that Tudge gave a speech this week that included a suggestion something needed to be done about migration to Sydney and Melbourne. Similarly it was not surprising that he suggested some vague measures to encourage or force migrants to move to regional areas or, at the very least, not Sydney or Melbourne. It was really just a repeat of what he said a couple months ago. Politicians love to talk about the need to do something on migration and they love even more to suggest vague solutions. They are less enamoured, however, with acting or proposing specific policies. Tudge\u2019s suggestion for a geographic visa requirement for certain migrants was so meagrely spelled out that to call it half-baked would be to greatly overstate things. His speech at the Menzies Research Centre was mostly just a gee-up for the Liberal party faithful in attendance than any great contribution to policy debate. Near the end he suggested that the government was \u201cworking on measures to have more new arrivals go to the smaller states and regions and require them to be there for at least a few years\u201d. Just how these measures would work was left unsaid. In an interview on ABC News Breakfast, he told Virginia Trioli that \u201cwhen somebody\u2019s on a visa, then we can easily place conditions upon it. Now, we haven\u2019t announced all the details exactly how we\u2019re going to do that yet but it\u2019s reasonably straightforward to do that.\u201d And yet when Trioli pressed him on how would you compel someone to stay in an area even if they were not able to get a job, Tudge replied that \u201cwe haven\u2019t outlined all the exact details yet\u201d and quickly moved on to talking about incentives currently in place that make it easier for migrants to gain a visa if they move to certain areas. And that is where it will mostly sit. The talk of forcing migrants to do things plays well with the conservative base but mostly remains talk because not only is it quite difficult to enforce such a visa requirement, it also would achieve little, because people go where the demand for work is. Consider internal migration. People move from state to state to chase work. In 2012, Victoria barely had any net interstate migration, and yet Western Australia was getting record numbers of people moving to the state. Now the situation is reversed \u2013 in the past 12 months, Western Australia saw 12,040 more people leave the state than move to it, while Victoria had just over 15,000 more people arrive than leave: Why has this occurred? Well consider that, in 2012, there were as few as 1.4 unemployed per vacancy in Western Australia. When the mining boom ended, this rose quickly to over five per vacancy, and so the people left. Where did they go? Victoria was a big destination. And why there? Because in 2012 there was up to five unemployed per vacancy in Victoria but, as employment grew in the state, this has fallen to now being around 2.3: Victoria and New South Wales are the easiest places to get work, so not surprisingly that is where Australians move. NSW\u2019s net interstate migration figures are always negative so it is best to look at the arrival figures alone, and here you can see quite clearly that since 2012 both it and Victoria have experienced a surge in arrivals that has echoed their improving economies: And, not surprisingly, there has been a very similar story for international migration: The supply of labour goes to where the demand for jobs is. The greater capital city areas of Sydney and Melbourne are also where the highest level of full-time employment exists. Among the non-capital city areas, only WA with its high dependency on mining has a high percentage of people aged 25-54 working full-time: And the problem with pushing people to the regions and non-Melbourne capital cities is that it can actually lead to unintentional consequences. Demographer Prof Peter McDonald of the University of Melbourne recently noted in a paper this very question of \u201cwhat would happen if international immigrants were diverted away from high-growth cities, as the government is proposing?\u201d He concluded that \u201cironically, reducing international migration to large cities would make it harder for the regions, including Adelaide and Hobart, to maintain their populations\u201d. The reason being that this shift of workers away from the areas where there was high demand for labour to places where the fight for jobs was already tough would mean the \u201cyoung people\u201d in places like Adelaide and Hobart \u201cwould be drawn to Sydney and Melbourne, replacing the immigrants\u201d. If you want migrants to settle in certain places, jobs and infrastructure need to be in place. Without them, not only will international migrants be unlikely to move there, neither will Australians.",

I, like most people, moved to where there was work.&#xa0;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/aug/12/blaming-a-rising-population-is-easy-finding-solutions-is-hard-but-it-can-be-done\">Blaming a rising population is easy. Finding solutions is hard but it can be done | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise that Tudge gave a speech this week that included a suggestion something needed to be done about migration to Sydney and Melbourne. Similarly it was not surprising that he suggested some vague measures to encourage or force migrants to move to regional areas or, at the very least, not Sydney or Melbourne. It was really just a repeat of what he said a couple months ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>Politicians love to talk about the need to do something on migration and they love even more to suggest vague solutions. They are less enamoured, however, with acting or proposing specific policies.</p> <p>Tudge\u2019s suggestion for a geographic visa requirement for certain migrants was so meagrely spelled out that to call it half-baked would be to greatly overstate things.</p> <p>His speech <a href=\"http://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/tudge/speeches/2018/ats001_2018.aspx\">at the Menzies Research Centre</a> was mostly just a gee-up for the Liberal party faithful in attendance than any great contribution to policy debate. Near the end he suggested that the government was \u201cworking on measures to have more new arrivals go to the smaller states and regions and require them to be there for at least a few years\u201d.</p> <p>Just how these measures would work was left unsaid.&#xa0;</p> <p>In an interview on ABC News Breakfast, <a href=\"http://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/tudge/interviews/2018/ati015_2018.aspx\">he told Virginia Trioli</a> that \u201cwhen somebody\u2019s on a visa, then we can easily place conditions upon it. Now, we haven\u2019t announced all the details exactly how we\u2019re going to do that yet but it\u2019s reasonably straightforward to do that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Politicians love to talk about the need to do something on migration and they love even more to suggest vague solutions.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet when Trioli pressed him on how would you compel someone to stay in an area even if they were not able to get a job, Tudge replied that \u201cwe haven\u2019t outlined all the exact details yet\u201d and quickly moved on to talking about incentives currently in place that make it easier for migrants to gain a visa if they move to certain areas.</p> <p>And that is where it will mostly sit. The talk of forcing migrants to do things plays well with the conservative base but mostly remains talk because not only is it quite difficult to enforce such a visa requirement, it also would achieve little, because people go where the demand for work is.</p> <p>Consider internal migration. People move from state to state to chase work.&#xa0;</p> <p>In 2012, Victoria barely had any net interstate migration, and yet Western Australia was getting record numbers of people moving to the state.</p> <p>Now the situation is reversed \u2013 in the past 12 months, Western Australia saw 12,040 more people leave the state than move to it, while Victoria had just over 15,000 more people arrive than leave:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NY3D6/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Why has this occurred? Well consider that, in 2012, there were as few as 1.4 unemployed per vacancy in Western Australia. When the mining boom ended, this rose quickly to over five per vacancy, and so the people left. Where did they go? Victoria was a big destination. And why there? Because in 2012 there was up to five unemployed per vacancy in Victoria but, as employment grew in the state, this has fallen to now being around 2.3:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vPOhF/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Victoria and New South Wales are the easiest places to get work, so not surprisingly that is where Australians move.</p> <p>NSW\u2019s net interstate migration figures are always negative so it is best to look at the arrival figures alone, and here you can see quite clearly that since 2012 both it and Victoria have experienced a surge in arrivals that has echoed their improving economies:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3iFab/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And, not surprisingly, there has been a very similar story for international migration:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YCYxW/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The supply of labour goes to where the demand for jobs is.&#xa0;</p> <p>The greater capital city areas of Sydney and Melbourne are also where the highest level of full-time employment exists.

The reason being that this shift of workers away from the areas where there was high demand for labour to places where the fight for jobs was already tough would mean the \u201cyoung people\u201d in places like Adelaide and Hobart \u201cwould be drawn to Sydney and Melbourne, replacing the immigrants\u201d.</p> <p>If you want migrants to settle in certain places, jobs and infrastructure need to be in place.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A no-deal Brexit would send shockwaves through the global financial system and is one of the main risks to economic stability, the International Monetary Fund has said. Echoing concerns from the Bank of England, the Washington-based organisation said the potential for millions of financial contracts between City banks and their counterparts across rest of Europe to collapse in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal was a major worry. The warning puts further pressure on the European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative MPs to justify a no-deal Brexit over a compromise negotiated by the prime minister that includes an agreement on cross-border financial contracts. Theresa May is seeking a settlement that at the very least would provide the legal framework for planes to fly across the channel, medicines to be imported from the continent and trillions of pounds worth of cross-border financial contracts to be maintained. A no-deal scenario has the potential to undermine legal contracts and disrupt trade with the result that the UK would suffer a post-Brext recession, the Treasury has argued. The IMF said its central forecast remained that by the end of the year Brussels and London would agree a path towards a deal on trade in goods and services. But it warned in a report for its annual meeting, which is staged this year in the Indonesian resort of Bali, that the failure to make progress not only had implications for the UK and eurozone economies but could also drag down the global economy. \u201cA rise in political and policy uncertainty could adversely affect financial market confidence,\u201d the IMF said in its financial stability report. \u201cFor example, growing anxiety about a breakdown in Brexit negotiations could give rise to contractual and operational uncertainties in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe.\u201d It added: \u201cIn general, the likelihood and severity of financial stability risks will be reduced by a closer relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU during the transition period and beyond, but will be heightened in the event of a hard Brexit.\u201d The importance of London as a financial centre was emphasised by the Bank of England on Tuesday when it said that the EU\u2019s lack of planning for Brexit had created growing risks for almost \u00a370tn of complex financial contracts. London boasts more foreign banks than any other financial centre and ranks as one of the world\u2019s three most important hubs for trading and asset management along with New York and Tokyo. Threadneedle Street said Brussels had made only limited progress to protect the financial system and time was running out, with less than six months before the UK is due to leave the EU. EU firms have about \u00a369tn of outstanding derivatives contracts that must be settled in London. It is estimated that as much as \u00a341tn will mature after Britain exits the bloc in March 2019. The Bank has also estimated that \u00a355bn worth of insurance contracts sold by UK insurers across the EU could be disrupted should they lose their authorisation to service these contracts. Such is the scale of the potential threat to the financial system that the IMF said central banks should stand ready to provide their own commercial banks with extra borrowing facilities. It also warned that London-based banks worried about the implications of a no-deal Brexit could send funds abroad, triggering a flight of capital and upending stock and bond markets. \u201cCentral banks should be prepared to use available instruments as needed. On the external side, a disorderly exit could lead to capital outflows. Authorities should closely monitor such developments and be aware of the potential for sharp asset price moves,\u201d it said in its report. The ERG has argued that a no-deal Brexit may be a better option than one that kept Britain aligned with EU rules, but prevented the government signing trade deals with other countries, especially the US. It has dismissed concerns that the EU would block cross-border financial transactions from being processed in London in the event of a no-deal Brexit, saying this would be an act of self-harm.",

    "webTitle": "UK economy flatlines in August but grows by 0.7% over the quarter - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound has been boosted by hopes that a Brexit deal could be struck after all, but upbeat commentary has yet to be supported with detail. Sterling is up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3179, and up 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1445. A stronger pound tends to work against the FTSE 100, where companies make a large proportion of earnings abroad. The leading UK index is down 0.5% at 7,202. Losses have extended on equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic, as investors grow fearful of a cocktail of risks facing the global economy. In the UK, the latest official figures showed the economy stalled in August, with zero growth. Things looked better in the three months to August, with GDP rising 0.7%, There was some startling corporate news, as Patisserie Valerie said it had uncovered a potentially fraudulent accounting black hole and a \u00a31m unpaid tax bill. Meanwhile the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said that after a lost decade for wage growth, a new dawn was breaking for pay. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all the comments, and please join us again tomorrow. The opening bell has rung and US markets are lower: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 26,403 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,874 Nasdaq: -0.5% at 7,701 US investors are reacting to higher treasury yields, which rose after producer prices data showed no let up in inflationary pressures and reinforced fears that rate hikes will come faster than previously thought. Patisserie Valerie has just published another trading update, after revealing this morning potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities. The bakery chain says it has only today become aware of a winding up petition that was filed with the High Court of Justice on 14 September. The petition relates to a \u00a31.14m payment due to HM Revenue &amp; Customs and a hearing date is listed for 31 October. Patisserie Valerie says in the latest update: The company and its advisors are in communication with HMRC with the objective of addressing the petition. The company continues to engage with its professional advisers to understand better the financial position of the Group and will make further announcements in due course. As revealed earlier, the company\u2019s finance chief, Chris Marsh, has been suspended, as has trading in the shares on AIM. Julian Jessop at the Institute of Economic Affairs says the latest GDP figures from the ONS suggest the UK economy is on course to grow by 0.6% in the third quarter (July to September). That would be the fastest rate since the final quarter of 2016, when the economy grew by 0.7%. Italy\u2019s finance minister, Giovanni Tria, has attempted to ease investor concerns over the government\u2019s plans to increase spending. We will try to do everything we can to regain the confidence of markets. Addressing a parliamentary panel in Rome, Tria added that the current market pricing of Italian bonds did reflect the sustainability of Italy\u2019s public debt. The Italian government\u2019s borrowing costs have jumped since it revealed it would run a deficit of 2.4% of GDP next year, tripling the previous government\u2019s target. Italian bond yields fell after Tria\u2019s comments, with the yield on two year government bonds down 8 basis points at 1.64%. The yield on 10-year bonds fell 3 basis points to 3.5%, where lower yields reflect lower borrowing costs. Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, has been speaking about pay this morning at a conference in London. Reuters reports: Evidence for a \u201cnew dawn\u201d in British wage growth after years of sluggish pay rises has strengthened over the past year, though the pace of the pick-up is likely to be limited, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane said on Wednesday. Haldane linked the modest forecast pick-up in pay with financial market expectations for the central bank to raise interest rates by about a quarter of a percentage point a year over the next three years. \u201cI think there is more compelling evidence of a new dawn breaking for pay growth, albeit with the light filtering through only slowly,\u201d he said in a speech to Britain\u2019s ACAS labour dispute arbitration service. \u201cA limited and gradual build in domestic cost pressures is one important factor underpinning the limited and gradual pace of further interest rates rises expected by financial markets and communicated by the Monetary Policy Committee,\u201d he added. The BoE increased interest rates for only the second time since the financial crisis in August, raising them to 0.75 percent from 0.5 percent. However, Haldane said that in the longer term there risked being downward pressure on pay growth from reduced worker bargaining power, automation and less competition between businesses. The Treasury has responded to the latest GDP figures, and says the national debt is falling, so the government can spend more on public services and keeping taxes as low as possible. Does this mean the chancellor Philip Hammond is planning to unveil tax cuts and spending increases? We\u2019ll find out when he delivers the budget on 29 October. A Treasury spokesperson said: We are building a stronger, fairer economy, and have made great progress repairing the public finances and helping more people into work. Our debt is starting to fall, so we can spend less on debt repayments and invest more in public services, while keeping taxes as low as possible. The economy continues to grow with retail, food and drink all performing well during the summer. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturing trade body EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says the UK economy returned to \u201cbusiness as usual in August\u201d: The main take away from today\u2019s bumper crop of releases on the economy is that the UK saw a spurt of activity in June and July not seen since the end of 2016. Beyond that it seems that it\u2019s back to business as usual more or less in August. The underlying services picture looks to be slow and steady, the construction sector has recovered its weather-related losses from earlier in the year and manufacturing weakness is persisting in the second half of this year so far. Jonathan Reynolds, Labour MP and shadow Treasury minister, says the ONS figures show the UK economy is underperforming: This month\u2019s GDP figures confirm that the economy continues to underperform under the Tories, with growth below its historical trend and real wages still below their 2010 levels. Only Labour has a plan to transform our economy and boost real pay, with a \u00a310 hour minimum wage and investment for the whole country. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says Brexit uncertainty is likely to be a drag on growth in 2018. Overall, the pattern of UK growth this year has been heavily affected by the weather, with the unusually long and cold winter dampening growth in the first quarter while the relatively warm spring and summer boosted growth in the second and third quarters of the year. But aside from these seasonal variations, the underlying trend is for moderate UK growth at a rate of around 1.5% per annum. This is somewhat below its longer term trend rate of around 2% and reflects the continued drag on business investment in particular from Brexit-related uncertainty. This seems likely to continue into the fourth quarter of 2018, when we expect some moderation of UK growth to around 0.3-0.4%. UK growth in 2017 was 1.7% - the slowest rate since 2012 when the economy grew by 1.4%. The UK failed to grow in August according to the latest monthly estimates from the Office for National Statistics. Zero growth followed a 0.4% rise in GDP in July, which was revised up from a previous estimate of 0.3%. Growth in June was also revised up, to 0.2% from 0.1%. The 0% forecast for August disappointed forecasts from economists polled by Reuters, who were predicting a 0.1% increase. The picture looked better on a rolling three month basis, with growth in the three months to August unchanged at 0.7% (after growth in three months to July was revised up from 0.6%). Retail, food and drink were hot spots during the heatwave. Here is the assessment from Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP from the ONS: The economy continued to rebound strongly after a weak spring with retail, food and drink production and housebuilding all performing particularly well during the hot summer months. However, long term growth continues to lag behind its historical trend. A large drop in imports of non-monetary gold alongside a jump in oil exports helped narrow our trade deficit with the world. Britain is near the bottom of the international rankings for the strength of its public finances according to the IMF, ahead of only Portugal. The figures show the UK government has \u00a35tn in liabilities, but less than \u00a33tn in assets, leaving it with a negative net worth of more than \u00a32tn. The weak position reflects the large-scale privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s, leaving the government with few assets. Meanwhile it has large debts and major future pension liabilities to finance. On the flip side, Norway came out on top with a war chest built on its publicly held oil wealth: It\u2019s a sea of red across European markets this morning, as investors struggle to find reasons to cheer. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,227 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 11,939 France\u2019s CAC: -0.6% at 5,290 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 19,966 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.7% at 9,196 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 372 Patisserie Valerie has some unsavoury news this morning. The bakery chain has uncovered irregularities in its accounts that are \u201cpotentially fraudulent\u201d. The firm has suspended Chris Marsh, its finance director, and its shares on AIM have been suspended from trading. In a statement to the stock exchange, chairman Luke Johnson said: We are all deeply concerned about this news and the potential impact on the business. We are determined to understand the full details of what has happened and will communicate these to investors and stakeholders as soon as possible. The company said its cash position was \u201csignificantly impacted\u201d by the discovery and it may lead to a material change in its overall financial position. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global investors are on edge, as they wait to see how a number of major situations play out. In Europe, the political situation in Italy continues to weigh on sentiment, as the new populist coalition heads into a row with the EU over its plans to increase spending, adding to its already massive debt pile of some 130% of GDP. In the US, the economy appears healthy but the prospect of more rate hikes is reigniting fears over emerging market economies, while uncertainty over the US/China trade war rumbles on. Jasper Lawler from London Capital Group explains: Uncertainty is prevailing in the financial markets, we are seeing more investors opting to wait and see how risks surrounding rising US treasury yields, global growth and China play out. Near term risks to global financial stability have increased rapidly over the past few months. The markets have been relatively complacent, but we are starting to see an acknowledgement of these risks which is keeping traders on the side-lines. The Dow Jones in the US closed down 56 points or 0.2% last night, and the FTSE 100 has opened down 11 points or 0.2% at 7,227. In the UK, growth figures for the month of August will give the latest indication of how well the economy is coping with Brexit uncertainty. They\u2019ll be out at 9.30am. Stick with us for the day\u2019s rolling news.",
