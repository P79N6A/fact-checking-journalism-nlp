      "bodyText": "Tesco fell to a two-month low on Friday in a rising market, as investors checked out of the supermarket group's shares in the wake of its first profit fall for 20 years. The company reported half-year figures on Wednesday showing trading profits dropped 10.5% to \u00a31.6bn, prompting concerns about its poor UK performance and growing problems in its international business. It closed down 2.8p at 315.35p on Friday, its worst level since the start of August as analysts queued up to downgrade the business. Kate Calvert and Freddie George at Seymour Pierce said: \"The market was prepared for a decline in profits from Tesco, but we believe its first-half results were disappointing even in that context. With no visibility on where UK profitability will bottom and too many of its overseas businesses face trading issues shorter term, we reiterate our reduce recommendation and cut our target price to 290p from 310p.\" Caroline Gulliver at Espirito Santo said: \"We believe Tesco is in transition and may well emerge a well-run, mature retailer with operating margins of over 5% and a cashflow yield above 10%. But we are not there yet and with several obstacles on the path we cut our fair value by 10% to 300p and keep our neutral rating.\" Overall the market ended the week on a positive note, boosted by better than expected US jobs figures, with the FTSE 100 finishing 43.24 points higher at 5871.02. Despite continuing concerns about the eurozone crisis \u2013 with the problems in Spain, Greece and Portugal far from resolved \u2013 the leading index added nearly 130 points over the course of the week. Commodity companies were among the main gainers on Friday after the US data suggested a brighter picture for the global economy. Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation led the way, up 18.6p to 333.3p after Credit Suisse said its shares could gain ground in the near term after recent weakness. Fellow Kazakh miner Kazakhmys climbed 31.5p to 738p, while Vedanta Resources rose 36p to \u00a311.01. Evraz, the Russian steelmaker controlled by Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, recovered from a fall on Thursday in the wake of news it was taking a majority stake in coalminer Raspadskaya. Its shares ended 9p to 254.1p. But engineering and design firm WS Atkins fell nearly 5%, down 34p to 695p after reports that its role in the west coast rail franchise fiasco was being investigated. The franchise was taken away from the winner, FirstGroup, after irregularities in the bidding process. Atkins \u2013 along with law firm Eversheds \u2013 had reportedly been hired in January to give technical advice on the franchise process. Meanwhile FirstGroup fell 4.5p to 196.1p having lost 20% on the day the franchise was withdrawn. Elsewhere energy services business Wood Group added 22.5p to 833.5p after an upbeat trading statement, with the company saying it was confident of meeting full year expectations. AstraZeneca added 7.5p to 2918.5p, as traders suggested Monday's decision by the new chief executive, Pascal Soriot, to halt its share buyback programme could mean it was on the takeover trail. US group Forest Laboratories was one name mentioned as a possible target. Among the mid-caps, the biggest loser was Kcom. The telecoms group fell 5.6p to 78.75p after reporting lower than expected growth in its business and public sector markets. Mitchells &amp; Butlers rose 5.6p to 306.6p after Peel Hunt raised its rating from hold to buy. On Thursday horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier had bought 7m shares in the pubs group through their Elpida vehicle, raising their stake to 22.47%. Joe Lewis, the billionaire currency trader who saw two bids for the business rejected last year, owns 26.3%. Finally Pursuit Dynamics lost a quarter of its value, down 2.05p to 6.075p after the company said it was seeking new funding as it awaited firm orders for its process technology equipment. It hopes to provide an update by the end of the month. In March this year the company raised \u00a39.4m through a rights issue, eight months after an \u00a38m placing.",

That's a real rise in the number of people working, not some technicality or worse still, a fall caused by people quitting the workforce.</p> <p>The US added 114,000 jobs in September, a pretty lacklustre figure and roughly in line with the number of jobs the US economy needs to add just to stand still. But the jobs figures for July and August were dramatically revised upwards. Employment for July was revised from 141,000 to 181,000, and the change for August was revised from 96,000 to 142,000. Together they managed to move the unemployment rate below 8%.</p> <p>Kevin Dunning, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said recent rises in consumer confidence and good car sales had seemed at odds with flat jobs reports for the past two months. Now that the bureau of labor statistics has revised its jobs figures for July and August, \"these figures make that discrepancy look more coherent\", he said. \"Things were not as bad as they seemed.\"</p> <h2>2. Government cuts have stalled</h2> <p>The slow growth of the jobs market has to date been driven entirely by the private sector in the midst of savage cuts in local and federal jobs. With occasional blips, the government has been cutting jobs since mid-2010. Overall government jobs have been up over 20,000 for the past three months. All that could change come January when savage government cuts are expected if a political agreement can not be found for the \"fiscal cliff\".</p> <h2>3. The price of employment</h2> <p>Recent shifts down have been driven in part by people dropping out of the workforce. Not this time. But, in part, this rise was driven by people being forced to take part-time work because they can not find full-time jobs. The number of part time workers who want full time jobs rose from 8 million to 8.6 million last month.</p> <p>Some 582,000 people took part time jobs because they couldn't find full time work last month. Those people contribute to the broader measure of unemployment, know as U-6, compiled by the BLS. U-6 includes \"marginally attached workers\" \u2013 those who are neither working nor looking for work but who have looked for work recently; people who have given up looking and people who are employed part-time for economic reasons. Thanks to the rise in part-timers, that rate remained unchanged at 14.7% in September.</p> <h2>4. Long-term legacy</h2> <p>The legacy of long-term unemployment caused by this recession is a major problem. Unemployment for adult women, men and whites is steadily moving in the right direction. But the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed at 4.8 million last month.</p> <p>Federal reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has warned that long-term unemployment could \"wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years\". A recent survey by recruitment software firm Bullhorn found it was easier for recruitment firms to place someone with a criminal record than a candidate who had been unemployed for two years.</p> <h2>5. Race and age divide</h2> <p>Unemployment rates for white men and women are moving firmly back in the right direction and are now around 7%. But for black Americans in general, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 13.4%. For Hispanics, the rate is 9.9%.</p> <p>The unemployment rate for black men over the age of 20 was 14.2% last month and for women 10.9%.

The French and German governments, which each have a 22.35% share of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings, would each control 9% of the new company. On Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel magazine reported that negotiations between the UK, French and German governments over the deal were close to collapse. However, sources close to the transaction said BAE and EADS remained committed to establishing an agreement by the 10 October deadline. Darling told the FT it was \"totally unacceptable\" France and Germany were seeking to take stakes in the new company while Britain was prepared to take a less active role. He said: \"We will be taken to the cleaners. I don't see how you could have a large new company like this with the French and German governments having large direct and indirect stakes and we have none. I would prefer that all three governments had minimal stakes. \"There is a danger that decisions in the defence and the commercial businesses could be taken on the basis of politics rather than what is best.\" BAE Systems played down MPs' concerns, saying the structure of the merged business would \"enable it to operate in a normal commercial manner which confers the same rights on all shareholders, large and small\".",

    "webTitle": "September jobs report a huge boost for Obama as unemployment rate tumbles", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barack Obama's hopes of holding on to the White House have received a major boost from new figures showing that the US unemployment rate has dropped below 8% for the first time since he took office in January 2009. The US added 114,000 new jobs in September, in line with expectations. But August's disappointing jobs figure was dramatically revised upwards from 96,000 to 142,000, helping to bring the unemployment rate down to 7.8%. \"Today, I believe that as a nation we are moving forward again,\" Obama told a raucous campaign rally in Fairfax, Virginia, on Friday a few hours after the figures were published. \"This morning, we found out that the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since I took office.\" Acknowledging that the economy was not out of the woods yet, he added: \"Now, every month's figures reminds us that we have still got too many of our friends and neighbours struggling to pay the bills ... But now is certainly not the time to talk down the economy and score a few political points. It's a reminder that this country has come too far too turn back now.\" Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, described the report as \"pretty darn good\". Greenhaus highlighted the fact that the total number of employed persons rose by \"a whopping\" 873,000 while the number of unemployed persons declined by 456,000, the largest increase in employment since January 2003. The news could not have been better timed for Obama, whose re-election campaign has been rattled in recent days by his perceived weak performance in his first debate with rival Mitt Romney. The report contained good news for many voters in key demographics being targeted ahead of the election. The unemployment rates for adult men is now 7.3%, for adult women it was 7%. But problems remain. September's unemployment rate for teenagers was 23.7% and there was little change for black Americans (13.4%) or Hispanics (9.9%). The number of people working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job rose from 8 million in August to 8.6 million in September. \"This is not what a real recovery looks like,\" Romney said in a statement. \"We created fewer jobs in September than in August, and fewer jobs in August than in July, and we've lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs since president Obama took office.\" He added: \"The results of President Obama's failed policies are staggering \u2013 23 million Americans struggling for work, nearly one in six living in poverty and 47 million people dependent on food stamps to feed themselves and their families. The Republican House speaker John Boehner also noted the figures are too high but, unusually, acknowledged there was some good news too. \"While there is positive news in today's report, job creation is far too slow and the unemployment rate is far too high.\" Conservative business guru Jack Welch, former boss of General Electric, went as far as accusing the Bureau of Labor Statistics of cooking the books. \"Unbelievable jobs numbers\u2026 these Chicago guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers,\" he said on Twitter. Labor secretary Hilda Solis immediately hit back at claims that the Obama administration might have skewed the jobs numbers. \"I'm insulted when I hear that because we have a very professional civil service,\" Solis told CNBC. The monthly jobs report has become a political hotspot on the 2012 election. Last month's disappointing figures came as the Democrat's wrapped up their convention in Charlotte. \"If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover,\" Romney said in a statement at the time. The final monthly jobs report of the campaign will come just days before the election on 6 November. While Obama can now point to 24 consecutive months of growth, the Republicans argue the rate remains historically weak. An increase of 114,000 barely covers population growth in the US as new entrants come into the job market. Geoff Hoffmann of recruitment firm DHR International said employers were growing increasingly confident but a lot of uncertainty remained. \"There's uncertainty about the impact of healthcare legislation, tax impacts, it's not really clear what is going to happen in 2013 and beyond,\" he said. Hoffmann said recovery was taking place in industries like technology, life sciences and that consumer and retail recruitment were doing \"surprisingly well\". But industries like financial services were still lagging after the financial crisis. Greenhaus said the report was \"95% better than expected\" but warned that slow growth could still come back to bite the recovery in the jobs market. The US recently cut its forecasts for gross domestic product \u2013 the widest measure of economic growth - after a sharp fall in manufacturing orders. \"You can't have jobs growth without economic growth,\" he said.",

So mining shares are among the leading risers, while utilities are out of favour. Meanwhile energy services business Wood Group is benefiting from an upbeat trading statement, with the company saying it was confident of meeting full year expectations. The engineering division continues to perform well, with a number of contracts in the Gulf of Mexico, and it confirmed its contract problems in Oman would lead to a $15m-$20m loss from its business there. Wood's shares have added 6p to 817p, but Keith Morris at Investec kept his hold rating an 800p price target: Today's statement does not highlight any significant changes to the 2012 outlook since the Interims at the end of August. With a rating in line with its large cap peers, we see no specific catalysts for outperformance. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 11.55 points at 5839.33, with Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation leading the way, up 8.9p at 323.6p. Analysts at Credit Suisse said: With the strong pick-up in nickel prices (lead indicator for stainless demand), rising stainless prices in Europe and potential supply risk in South Africa (strike risk spreading) we expect the fourth quarter to be a trough for prices and, given very weak recent performance, ENRC shares could see improved momentum near term. Still with the sector, Vedanta Resources has risen 32p to \u00a310.97 while Kazakhmys has climbed 16p to 722.5p. Evraz, the Russian steelmaker controlled by Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, has recovered from Thursday's fall in the wake of it taking a majority stake in coal miner Raspadskaya. Its shares are 5.7p better at 250.8p. But with defensive stocks out of favour, United Utilities is 8.5p lower at 727.5p and Pennon is down 6p at 726.5p. Tesco is the biggest faller, down 4.7p to 313.45p, as investors continued to react unfavourably to its first profit fall in twenty years. Caroline Gulliver at Espirito Santo said: The deteriorating outlook for Tesco's international business, for both structural and cyclical growth, leads us to cut our group pretax profit estimates by 10% for 2013 and 16% for 2014. We believe Tesco is in transition and may well emerge a well-run, mature retailer with operating margins of over 5% and a cashflow yield above 10%. At which point we would see value in the shares up to 380p. But we are not there yet and with several obstacles on the path we cut our fair value by 10% to 300p and keep our neutral rating.",
