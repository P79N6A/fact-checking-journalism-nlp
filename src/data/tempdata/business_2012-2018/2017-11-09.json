      "bodyText": "Shoppers are not \u201cpulling on the handbrake\u201d, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s insisted as he blamed a soggy August for a recent slowdown in sales growth. The supermarket revealed a 9% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a3251m in the six months to 23 September as rising costs offset a 1.6% rise in sales at established stores. Sainsbury\u2019s said sales growth had slowed to 0.6% in the second three months of the period from 2.3% in the previous quarter. Despite the slowdown, Mike Coupe insisted: \u201cWe don\u2019t see [customers] pulling on the handbrake.\u201d He said Sainsbury\u2019s had benefited from a warm spring which helped boost sales of ice-cream, barbecue food and paddling pools at its Argos chain in the first three months of the half year. However, the following three months had been affected by a \u201cparticularly depressing August\u201d, beset by chilly and wet weather, while sales of coats and cold weather gear fell during a relatively warm September. \u201cThese things tend to play a draw over the season,\u201d Coupe said. \u201cThere is nothing in the numbers we are looking at that give cause for concern about Christmas.\u201d He said food price inflation had been running at about 2% but Sainsbury\u2019s was offsetting that by cutting costs and improving efficiency, suggesting that the market was now through the worst of price rises spurred by last year\u2019s fall in the value of the pound. \u201cYou can see from the mood music of some of our competitors that there is a level of nervousness in the market but there are lots of reasons to believe [things will go well for Sainsbury\u2019s],\u201d he said. Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s would benefit from hosting 165 Argos outlets in its stores, up from 30 last year. The catalogue shops boost grocery sales in their host supermarkets by 1% to 2% and those open for a year are seeing sales growth of 20%. Sainsbury\u2019s intends to install 250 Argos outlets in its stores after buying the chain for \u00a31.4bn last year. It is also adding sushi counters and Patisserie Valerie cafes in a bid to draw more shoppers back to large supermarkets. All the major supermarket chains have been suffering from heavy competition from the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl and a change in habits towards shopping online and at local convenience stores. Coupe said grocery sales at Sainsbury\u2019s established stores, including large supermarkets, were up over the half year after price cuts and improvements in the quality of its food. The group is also seeing strong growth in online grocery sales, convenience stores and in clothing, sales of which rose 7% over the half year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry\u2019s new chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, has revealed plans to take the British luxury brand more upmarket as part of a shake-up that comes with a hefty price tag of its own. The company\u2019s shares fell 10% \u2013 wiping nearly \u00a3850m off its value \u2013 as investors took fright at Gobbetti\u2019s ambition to turn Burberry into a super-luxe brand, like Gucci and Dior, which have higher prices and profit margins. To get there it will spend millions of pounds turning its stores into temples of luxury and stop selling its trench coats and handbags through some department stores, denting sales in the short-term. Gobbetti spelled out his vision nine days after Christopher Bailey, the group\u2019s president and design chief, unexpectedly announced his departure after 17 years with the brand. \u201cI played no part in it and am sad to see him go,\u201d said Gobbetti of Bailey\u2019s departure. \u201cThe process has started but it will take some time to find the right creative leader for Burberry for the next decade. Don\u2019t expect any announcements very, very soon.\u201d Bailey transformed Burberry from a small UK company into a global fashion brand, building its digital presence by streaming its fashion shows live and redesigning its flagship stores. He became chief executive in 2014 but luxury goods veteran Gobbetti was hired as a co-chief executive two years later after investors became anxious about the design supremo also running the business. In July Gobbetti replaced Christopher Bailey and became sole chief executive. Bailey was named president instead and his sudden decision to quit was a surprise to most fashion-watchers. In Thursday\u2019s strategy update Gobbetti, who previously ran C\u00e9line, said he would close some outlets in department stores, starting in the US, before moving on to the European operation. \u201cWe must sharpen our brand position, we must move up to plant ourselves firmly in luxury,\u201d explained Gobbetti, who said the luxury market was changing and that shoppers wanted more \u201cfashion and newness\u201d. Gobbetti gave the example of simple polo shirts, which are priced at \u00a3145 to \u00a3275 each. They needed to be priced about 50% higher to match other luxury players, he said. Other products, such as Burberry\u2019s famous trenchcoats, which cost around \u00a31,200, were already at the right level, he said. Burberry said it was too early to give numbers for affected outlets and jobs. To help fund the transformation Gobbetti said the company would cut its running costs by \u00a3120m a year but those savings would be ploughed into the investment programme. RBC analyst Rogerio Fujimori said the plan would require a \u201clot of time and patience\u201d from investors.\u201d. The shares closed down 198p at \u00a317.87. The company refused to comment on speculation that British fashion designer Phoebe Philo, who is creative director at French house C\u00e9line, is the front runner to replace Bailey. Burberry trades on its 161-year British heritage but the Italian businessman said it was not essential that the candidate came from this country as there were plenty of examples of US and European brands with creative directors from elsewhere. Gobbetti\u2019s plan was unveiled as Burberry posted half-year profits. Like-for-like retail sales were up 4% in the six months to September, ahead of analysts\u2019 forecast of 3% growth, with the UK growing in double digits. Pre-tax profits also came in ahead of expectations at \u00a3128m. Overall, revenues rose 9% to \u00a31.3bn. Rainwear has boosted sales in the past six months, with the car coat and the tropical gabardine particularly popular. China posted the strongest growth while UK sales slowed in the latest quarter compared with last year. After the Brexit vote in June 2016, sterling fell sharply and there was an influx of tourists who bought Burberry coats and bags. Steve Clayton, manager of a Hargreaves Lansdown fund that holds a 3.8% stake in Burberry, said: \u201cMr Gobbetti wants to take Burberry out of all but the most exclusive stores, starting in the US wholesale channel, and then more widely. It\u2019s a textbook luxury brand repositioning, which should leave Burberry jostling up against the world\u2019s most exclusive names, with the margins to match. But this will take time and in the near term, sales growth will be held back and the group must invest more to achieve its goals.\u201d Clayton thinks the move upmarket makes sense. \u201cTrue luxury brands command immense pricing power and generate fabulous margins and cash flows. They sell to wealthy consumers and just like their customers, are more resistant to downturns. As Mr Gobbetti puts it, \u2018we will play in the most rewarding, enduring segment of the market\u2019. That\u2019s a prize worth paying for.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "European stock markets have closed, with losses across the board. Here\u2019s the damage: Traders took their cue from Asia, says David Madden of CMC Markets: Stocks in Europe sold-off as the sudden and severe decline in the Nikkei 225 overnight trigged fears around the world. Lately stock markets in Europe have been lacklustre as there has no major change to the economic or political outlook. The low volatility was interrupted today by the rapid drop in the Japanese market, which got traders out of their comfort zone in Europe. The sell-off is broad based, and when you look back at how much ground was made in 2017, dealers don\u2019t need much of an excuse to exit the market. That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW As ever nothing is easy in Greece. Just when prime minister Alexis Tsipras was sounding an optimistic note on the investment front earlier, the Canadian company, Eldorado Gold, has announced that it will freeze one of the biggest investment projects in the country. Sounding a defiant note, George Burns, Eldorado\u2019s President and CEO said the Vancouver-based firm was not only freezing further investment in its gold copper deposit at Skouries but taking legal action Greece\u2019s ministry of energy and environment, \u201cAlthough we have made good progress on the Olympias mine, we require the necessary permits and government support prior to investing further in Skouries,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAs a consequence we are now taking the necessary legal action to enforce the Company\u2019s rights while continuing efforts to resolve outstanding matters through ongoing dialogue.\u201d Upon approval and receipt of the required permits, the Company will re-assess its investment in the Skouries project if the government was \u201csupportive and open to discussions regarding the use and implementation of best available technologies.\u201d The tough stance is likely to put off other foreign investors who have often cited Greece\u2019s labyrinthine bureaucracy and unwieldy justice systems as major obstacles to investment. In September Eldorado had threatened to halt new investment in its Olympias and Stratonii mines in the northern region of Halkidiki because of a spat over permits but subsequently backed down. With more than 2,000 employees, the firm is one of the largest foreign employers in Greece. The mood in the stock markets has \u201creally soured this afternoon\u201d, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. With Wall Street follows Europe into the red, there\u2019s not much optimism on the trading floors today. He writes: Despite the European Commission promising the best Eurozone growth for a decade in 2017, the region\u2019s indices were in a bad mood this Thursday. That\u2019s because the euro attracted most of the buzz; while the currency rose 0.3% against both the dollar and the pound the DAX and CAC plunged, dropping 1.3% and 1% respectively. An acute retail headache, and a red-soaked set of mining stocks, meant the FTSE failed to take advantage of the pound\u2019s losses against the euro (and flat performance against the dollar). Instead the UK index slid half a percent , taking it under 7500 as it was dragged lower by Burberry\u2019s eye-watering 10% decline, a 2% drop from Sainsbury\u2019s and a 2% to 3% falls from Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Anglo American. The worst-performing stock in Europe is Vestas, the wind turbine maker. It disappointed investors today by reporting a drop in pre-tax profits and smaller profit margins as competition gets tougher. An influential House of Lords Committee have urged the government to agree a Brexit transitional deal before the end of this year, or risk losing City jobs overseas. Having taken evidence from City experts, the EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee has concluded that ministers need to act now, before banks trigger their own contingency plans. Committee chair Baroness Falkner has written to chancellor Philip Hammond, saying: \u201cThe clock is relentlessly ticking. Witness, after witness, told us that financial services industry won\u2019t be able to continue servicing cross-border clients after 2019 if a transition period is not agreed by the end of this year. The UK\u2019s financial services industry will be severely hit \u2013 as will EU counterparties. \u201cThe more the Government waits, the more the value of such a period irreversibly declines. A trickle of banks and insurers have started to implement their contingency plans ahead of access to the Single Market being suspended in March 2019. The Government must urgently negotiate a transition period to stop this trickle turning into a flood.\u201d Wall Street has joined the global stock market selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 103 points, or 0.4%, at the start of trading in New York. The long-running saga of Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to float oil giant Aramco has taken another curious twist today. The UK government has confirmed it is close to handing Aramco a $2bn credit line. It means British taxpayers will effectively be lending the company money to encourage it to buy goods and services in the UK. The government has denied that the credit guarantee has any link to the question of whether Aramco - which is the world\u2019s largest oil producer - should list 5% of its shares in London. If the IPO goes through, it will be the biggest flotation ever and would deliver a bonanza of fees for the City. But the idea has been criticised by several major investors, as existing listing rules will need to be bent for Aramco. Nick Macpherson, formally the top civil servant in the Treasury, isn\u2019t impressed at all. More here: Just in: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has risen, and by more than expected. Some 239,000 US citizens filed \u2018initial claims\u2019 last week, as the jobs market got back to normal after the hurricane season. That\u2019s up from 229,000 in the previous seven days, and more than expected. But still, it\u2019s a very low figures in historical terms. The EC\u2019s upbeat eurozone growth forecasts haven\u2019t brought much cheer to the region\u2019s stock markets. Every major index is down today, although not massively. The FTSE 100 has shed around 40 points, or 0.55%, while Germany\u2019s DAX has lost nearly 1%. The FTSE 100 is being dragged down by Burberry, which is still off by 10%. Investors aren\u2019t happy that today\u2019s strategy of moving more upmarket will hurt profits for the next couple of years. Eurozone bonds are also under pressure, with prices falling and yields (the rate of return) up. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a single trigger for the selloff. But after such a long rally, investors can\u2019t be blamed for cashing in some profits. Rabobank rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor says (via Reuters): \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a bit of a view out there that it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s going to get in bond markets so it\u2019s worth taking a bit of profit.\u201d The European Commission\u2019s forecasts are more pessimistic than other forecasts. For example, the IMF predicts that the UK will grow by 1.7% this year, and by 1.5% in 2018. But the big picture is unimpressive, with the EC predicting that Britain will suffer \u201csubdued\u201d private consumption growth and weak business investment. Peter Dixon, Senior Economist at Commerzbank, says the forecasts don\u2019t make \u201cparticularly pleasant reading for UK policymakers\u201d This comes just a week after the BoE projections pointed to growth of 1.6% next year and 1.7% in 2019. Although the BoE\u2019s growth path is a little higher, the key point is that very few forecasters currently expect the UK to grow at sustained rates in excess of 2%. Just as fans of the English national football team used to regard \u201conly\u201d reaching the quarter finals of the World Cup as a failure, they would happily accept such an outcome today. In a similar vein, for the foreseeable future UK policymakers who used to regard 2% GDP growth as being too slow, might look back on the halcyon days of such growth as a golden era. Looking back at the UK housing market.... rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned that mortgage borrowers in Northern Ireland, East Midlands, East Anglia and the South West are most vulnerable if UK interest rates keep rising. In a new report, Moody\u2019s analyst Steven Becker says: \u201cIn the event of a rate increase to 1.25%, borrowers in East Midlands, East Anglia and Northern Ireland are up to 2x more likely to face financial stress and go into arrears than a borrower in Scotland.\u201d When it raised interest rates last week, to 0.5%, the Bank of England indicated that borrowing costs would rise a few more times over the next few years. The EC predicts that Greece will grow by 1,6% this year, a little faster than the UK. This is expected to jump to 2.5% in both 2018 and 2019 (a lot faster than the UK!). And over in Athens prime minister Alexis Tsipras has appealed to Arab entrepreneurs to invest in Greece, as he pushes the message that the transformation of the crisis-plagued country is underway. My colleague Helena Smith reports: Greece has crossed the rubicon and is now one of the best countries in the world to invest in, Alexis Tsipras told the EU-Arab world summit in Athens. Opening the second such meeting in the Greek capital the leftist leader urged businessmen from across the Arab world to grab the golden opportunity of investment in a nation that after eight gruelling years of austerity-fueled recession was finally showing signs of economic recovery. \u201cGreece for certain has emerged from crisis, Greece has crossed the rubicon of crisis,\u201d he told the conference describing the country as an especially attractive place for investment because of low acquisition and labour costs. Tsipras gave the speech as unionists attached to the powerful KKE communist party prepared mass to stage mass protest rallies nationwide. Did the EC consider a hard Brexit scenario when drawing up today\u2019s forecasts? No, we had a purely technical approach based on the \u2018ongoing status quo\u2019, replies commissioner Pierre Moscovici. He adds that this doesn\u2019t mean that a particular option is better or worse. Also, any change in the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU would affect every European country\u2019s economic outlook (so it would be unfeasibly tricky to model). Importantly, these new forecasts are based on the assumption that the EU and the UK maintain the current \u2018status quo\u2019 in 2019. So if Britain doesn\u2019t hammer out a transition deal, today\u2019s forecasts could prove to be too optimistic. In another blow, the EC has warned that Britain\u2019s budget deficit is going to rise in the current financial year. After \u201cseveral years of improvement\u201d, the UK\u2019s general government deficit is expected to rise to 2.5% of GDP in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, up from 2.3%. The EC also warns that Britain\u2019s deficit could be even higher, if negotiations with the EU go badly. It says: Risks to the forecast point to upward pressure on the general government deficit, particularly in case of a Brexit-related trade shock during the forecast period. On the UK, the European Commission says that growth has been slowing as rising inflation hits consumers and Brexit uncertainty spooks businesses. Today\u2019s report states: Economic growth in the UK has been slowing since the start of the year, as higher consumer prices constrained private consumption growth. Based on a purely technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK, growth is still expected to remain subdued over the forecast horizon. Consumption growth is projected to be modest, in line with weak real wage growth, while uncertainty continues to weigh on business investment. However, net exports are expected to provide some support to growth, and the labour market is projected to show continued resilience. And here\u2019s a chart, showing how the EC expects Britain\u2019s growth to slow: The report is online here: THE UNITED KINGDOM: Slowdown in growth expected to continue European Economic Forecast \u2013 Autumn 2017 But....the EC also concedes that too many people across the eurozone are out of work. Unemployment in the euro area is expected to average 9.1% this year, its lowest level since 2009, dropping to 8.5% in 2018 and 7.9% in 2019. In contrast, the UK\u2019s unemployment rate is just 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is presenting today\u2019s forecasts now. Sounding upbeat, Moscovici says the eurozone is expected to post its fastest growth since the financial crisis, adding: We have entered a new phase of the economic recovery, with stronger growth driven by resilient consumption, the global upswing, loose financing conditions and falling unemployment. Here\u2019s a chart from the new EC economic forecasts, showing which countries are expected to post the strongest and weakest growth (lighter = faster) Having slashed the UK\u2019s growth forecasts, the EC has also raised its forecasts for the eurozone. The Commission now believes that eurozone countries will expand by 2.2% this year, up from the 1.7% forecast earlier this year. The Commission says the eurozone has enjoyed a bumper year, having shaken off the debt crisis that gripped the region a couple of years ago. \u201cThe European economy has performed significantly better than expected this year, propelled by resilient private consumption, stronger growth around the world, and falling unemployment. Investment is also picking up amid favourable financing conditions and considerably brightened economic sentiment as uncertainty has faded,\u201d However, growth is expected to dip slightly in 2018 to 2.1%, and then to 1.9% to 2019. If the EC is right, it means the UK will lag behind the eurozone for the next couple of years.... Newflash: The European Commission has slashed its forecast for UK growth, warning that Brexit uncertainty will hurt business investment. It now expects Britain\u2019s economy to grow by just 1.5% this year, down from 1.8% previously. The EC also predicts that growth will slow to 1.3% next year, and just 1.1% in 2019. The forecasts also appear to be based on a transition deal being agreed that will prevent a cliff edge in 2019 and a hard Brexit. The EC says: \u201cInvestment growth is forecast to weaken in 2018, as many firms are likely to continue deferring investments in the face of uncertainty. \u201cGiven the ongoing negotiation on the terms of the UK withdrawal from the EU, our projections for 2019 are based on a purely technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK.\u201d So far this year, the UK grew by 0.3% in January to March and also in April to June, rising to 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017. So the EC\u2019s new forecasts don\u2019t sound unduly pessimistic. RICS has surveyed chartered surveyors and estate agents from across the UK to gauge the state of the market. A number of them are particularly gloomy (although others less so). Here\u2019s a selection from today\u2019s report: Newcastle Upon Tyne: Neil Foster of Foster Maddison Property Consultants. Prolonged political uncertainty and weak direction from government is hampering sentiment amongst buyers and sellers. We are in for a long winter. Ilkley, Yorkshire: Bill Dale of Dale Eddison The market has slowed in the last month, albeit after a frenetic period in July and August when stock levels of available houses fell as a result of strong sales. There is a noticeable seasonal slowdown and the lack of supply is also holding back activity Liverpool: Derek Coates of Venmore: A surprisingly busy month for sales and buyer enquiries. However, there is a lack of properties coming on to the market which has been a worrying trend for some time. Vendors appear unwilling to commit in the present climate of uncertainty. Worksop, Nottinghamshire: David Hawke of David Hawke &amp; Co Although as we approach Christmas you would expect a downturn but this reduction in market activity is well beyond this, generally so quiet!! Norfolk: Nigel Steele of Jackson-Stops: A slowing market with Brexit and economic uncertainty having an effect so that it could be a long winter. Beaconsfield: John Frost of The Frost Partnership: There is life in the market at the right price! Buyers are offering lower than guide prices and sales are doing the same up the chain. Stamp duty levels have had a considerable impact on the number of potential instructions coming to the market. West Devon and Cornwall: David Lewis of Stags: Continued political and economic uncertainty is negatively influencing the market place. Actively levels have fallen \u2013 has winter come early? Lampeter, Wales: Andrew Morgan of Morgan &amp; Davies: A very busy period in the market across all sectors. This appears to be benefitting the rural lifestyle type properties most of all. No signs of depreciation at present. Putney, London: Allan Fuller of Allan Fuller Estate Agents: We usually have buyers registering keen to move before Christmas. So far we are registering 80% less than normal during October. Vendors more receptive to price drops and some are agreeing to 10% reductions, which are then attracting interest. East London: Josh Homans of Valunation: The sales market has dramatically changed and technically crashed across the board. In E2 the difference between asking and sale price is a staggering 20%. Glasgow: Grant Robertson of Allied Surveyors Autumn/winter slowdown in evidence. Strong interest for market leading homes but generally things are slower. Belfast: Gareth Gibson of Douglas Huston Supply remains very restricted however new enquiries are lower, the normal September lift was not seen. PSA, the firm which owns Vauxhall and Opel, has announced a wide-ranging cost-reduction plan including voluntary layoffs. It\u2019s an important development for UK workers at Vauxhall\u2019s plants near Liverpool, and at Luton, as well as Opel factories across Europe. PSA, which also owns Peugeot, says it hopes to avoid compulsory redundancies, as part of a plan to improve Vauxhall and Opel\u2019s performance. Crucially, PSA is promising not to shut any factories, but there is going to be a shake-up. Opel/Vauxhall chief executive Michael Lohscheller told journalists at a press conference in R\u00fcsselsheim, Germany, that the company would not shut any factories in Europe and try to avoid compulsory redundancies. Any cost reductions would be achieved through shorter working hours, voluntary redundancies and early retirement. Lohscheller said personnel costs in relation to revenues were too high. Some workers who are on 40 hour-weeks will be moved to 35 hours. He added the group would consult employee representatives, \u201cespecially the works council and the union IG Metall in Germany\u201d and had already held meetings this morning. PSA boss Carlos Tavares, speaking at the same press conference, reiterated that the company needed to act fast to become more competitive. \u201cOpel is facing a dramatic situation. There is no time to waste\u2026 This dramatic situation is getting worse day by day. We have a significant opportunity to rescue this company.\u201d The FT\u2019s Peter Campbell is also tweeting from the press conference call: RICS\u2019s gloomy survey of the UK housing market gets plenty of coverage this morning. In the Financial Times, Chris Giles says: Estate agents have become more pessimistic over the housing market, saying prices have not risen at all in the past three months, newly agreed sales are down, and prices are likely to fall in most parts of the country. Andy Bruce of Reuters shows how optimism has hit its lowest level since 2012, if you exclude the wobble after the Brexit vote. Ben Chu of the Independent points out that the top end of the housing market is under the most pressure: More expensive homes are under significant downward price pressure, with 70 per cent of surveyors reporting that offers for homes in the \u00a31m plus bracket are coming in below asking price. Some 60 per cent also reported lower offers for homes on the market priced between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31m. Pantheon Economics\u2019 Sam Tombs is also concerned: Shares in UK housebuilders are also falling this morning, following this morning\u2019s downbeat survey of chartered surveyors and estate agents. Barratt Development are down 2.8% and Persimmon have lost 2.7%. Investors are concerned to learn that UK house prices have stalled, with fewer potential buyers making inquiries about buying a home. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, explains why Burberry\u2019s shares have slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 this morning: It was crucial Burberry\u2019s new chief executive Marco Gobbetti got off to a good start after chief creative officer Christopher Bailey announced he\u2019ll be off next year. Unfortunately, the market appears unimpressed with Gobbetti\u2019s vision of Burberry\u2019s strategy, and his first address to the market since taking over has failed to prevent the loss of big share price gains made since September. Gobbetti\u2019s aim to generate high-single digit revenue growth plus \u2018meaningful\u2019 operating margin expansion is ambitious, yes, but the big benefits don\u2019t come through until 2021. Ouch! Shares in fashion chain Burberry have slumped by around 9% in early trading. The slide came as Burberry\u2019s new CEO Marco Gobbetti, who replaced Christopher Bailey in July, revealed that he wants to take the British luxury brand more upmarket. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Gobbetti reveals in a strategy update today that the company will close some outlets in department stores that don\u2019t fit in with this move, starting in the US, before reviewing Europe in coming years. The company said it was too early to give numbers for affected outlets and jobs. Burberry has also posted better-than-expected numbers this morning. Like-for-like retail sales were up 4% in the six months to September, ahead of the analysts\u2019 forecast of 3% growth, with the UK growing in double digits. Rainwear did particularly well, for example the car coat and the tropical gabardine. Pretax profits also came in ahead of expectations at \u00a3128m. Overall revenues rose 9% to \u00a31.3bn. A spokesman said the \u201cstrong growth in the UK and mainland China with the Chinese luxury consumer travelling, has continued\u201d Gobbetti told investors this morning that: We will reshape our offer, increasing and invigorating the fashion content. We will create compelling luxury leather goods and accessories to attract new customers. We will build on the strength of our apparel and re-energise it. We will build our offer to provide a complete look for our customers, while continuing to simplify our ranges. However, growth slowed in the UK in the latest quarter due to a tough comparison with last year. Following the Brexit vote in June 2016, sterling fell sharply and there was an influx of tourists who bought Burberry coats and bags. Germany\u2019s already sizeable trade surplus has widened further, as Europe\u2019s largest economy continues to export much more than it imports. The Federal Statistical Office has just reported that German exports rose by 4.6% over the last 12 months in September, to \u20ac110.4. Imports also rose, by 5.5%, to \u20ac86.3bn. This pushed the overall German trade surplus for the month up to \u20ac24.1bn, from \u20ac23.7bn in September 2016. The figures also show that Germany ran a chunky trade surplus with the rest of the European Union - exporting \u20ac65bn to fellow EU member states while importing \u20ac57.6bn. That includes Germany\u2019s large trade surplus with the UK, of course.... Another sign that German-manufactured products are valued around the world? That the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus measures are paying off? Or that Europe\u2019s largest member is benefitting from the relative weakness of the euro compared to the Deutsche Mark? Probably all three.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s army of estate agents are getting more pessimistic about the UK housing market, as the London property market continues to cool. A new survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has found that prices nationally have stalled over the last few months, with the number of new sales dropping. More RICS members reported a fall in new buyers last month than a rise, suggesting \u201csubdued momentum\u201d in the market as demand for properties cools. Sellers of the most expensive houses are also having to accept lower offers, in another sign that demand is weakening in the face of slow economic growth and political uncertainty. Here are the key points from RICS\u2019 survey: National price indicator turns flat with sentiment still downbeat in London and the South East Subdued sales trends now being reported across most regions 70% of respondents report sales prices are coming in below asking prices for homes valued at \u00a31m+ These charts show clearly how the market has weakened in the last few months, with sales expectations hitting the lows seen after the Brexit vote and during the eurozone crisis: The report is more pessimistic than recent surveys from Halifax and Nationwide. Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, paints a pretty gloomy picture of the market today: \u201cThe combination of the increased cost of moving, a lack of fresh stock coming to the market, uncertainly over the political climate and now an interest rate hike appears to be taking its toll on activity in the housing market. With both buyer enquiries slipping and sales expectations also subdued, the sense is that home owners are staying put and first time purchasers are increasingly focusing on that part of the market supported by the Help to Buy incentive. A stagnant second-hand market is bad news for the wider economy, not just in terms of spending but also because it restricts mobility. More details to follow.... Also coming up today... New German trade data is being released this morning, showing how Europe\u2019s largest economy posted another surplus in September (more on this shortly). Auto maker PSA Group is outlining its new strategy for Opel/Vauxhall this morning, in an attempt to return to profitability by 2020. The plan includes offering an electrified version of all its models by 2024. Car workers at its plants across Europe will be listening to see what it means for their jobs... Pharma group AstraZeneca, fashion chain Burberry, supermarket group Sainsbury, and energy provider National Grid and car dealership Bookers are all reporting results. Sainsbury have reported a rise in sales, but a 9% drop in profits over the last six months. The agenda: 7am GMT: German trade data for September 9am GMT: The European Central Bank publishes its latest economic bulletin 10am GMT: The European Commission releases new economic forecasts 1.30pm GMT: The weekly US jobless report",

      "bodyText": "The UK is finalising arrangements for a $2bn (\u00a31.52bn) loan guarantee to Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil company, but the government has denied the support is in any way linked to the the state-owned firm\u2019s potential listing on the London Stock Exchange. The UK\u2019s credit export agency, the UKEF, which helps British companies win contracts with foreign companies, is backing the loan. The oil-rich kingdom is planning to privatise 5% of state-owned Saudi Aramco in 2019, as part of a plan to raise funds to help diversify its economy. The UK is hoping Aramco will list on the London Stock Exchange. Downing Street said this week that London had a \u201cstrong case\u201d to host what would be the world\u2019s biggest ever flotation. The City regulator has proposed rule changes that would help a listing by a sovereign nation such as Saudi Arabia. The company could be valued at $2tn, though some experts have said that figure is overinflated. The Treasury denied there was a link between the new loan guarantee and the listing. \u201cIt\u2019s totally separate to that,\u201d an official said. But Nick Macphereson, former permanent secretary to the Treasury, associated the loan guarantee to the potential listing, attacking it as a commercially motivated move by government. \u201cHer Majesty\u2019s government guaranteeing a loan to Aramco would be a further lurch in descent to mercantilism. Mr Gladstone will be turning in his grave,\u201d he tweeted. The Treasury could not name the British companies which stood to benefit from the agreement, but said UKEF was holding exporter events in coming months to help British suppliers win deals with the Saudi firm. As well as UK oil and gas companies, renewable energy groups are expected to benefit. The $2bn loan guarantee is not the first time the UK government has extended financial support to Aramco. UKEF has given the company a total of \u00a3500m of credit support over the last five years, including help for Sadara, a huge petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cUK Export Finance works to increase UK exports by providing finance to overseas buyers of our goods and services. As part of this, we will be providing Saudi Aramco with support in the form of credit guarantees to procure from the UK. This builds on previous support for UK exports as part of Saudi Aramco joint venture projects.\u201d The credit export agency came under fire two years ago for helping oil and gas companies abroad, despite a coalition government pledge to stop the agency aiding \u201cdirty fossil-fuel energy production\u201d. Greenpeace UK criticised the government for announcing the new support while annual UN climate talks are taking place in Bonn. \u201cIt\u2019s high time the UK government stopped acting like a benevolent fund for fossil fuel firms and started championing the clean technologies that can provide jobs and trade opportunities for Britain,\u201d said the group\u2019s executive director, John Sauven. Separately, Saudi Aramco said it had signed agreements worth $4.5bn in total with eight international oil and gas contractors to work on gasfields and pipelines in the kingdom. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Vodafone has struck a \u00a3500m deal to bring next-generation gigabit speed broadband to a dozen UK cities, enabling hospitals to send CT scan images in seconds and consumers to download 4k quality movies in minutes rather than hours. The company has struck a deal with CityFibre, the publicly listed company, to take fibre optic lines to 1m homes by 2021, with an option to extend to 5m homes by 2025, covering 20% of the UK broadband market. While few consumers and businesses currently need gigabit speeds, of up to 1,000Mbps, it is likely to become the norm in the coming years. It would be 50 times faster than standard UK broadband and three times quicker than the fastest option currently available from BT. Fibre networks will be needed to provide the back-end data shifting muscle for next generation 5G mobile networks and the internet of things \u2013 including fully automated homes, driverless cars and \u201csmart\u201d manufacturing. The cities where full-fibre networks will be rolled out have yet to be named but are likely to be locations such as Peterborough, Milton Keynes, Leeds and Edinburgh, where CityFibre has already been focusing. Construction is due to start in 2018 with the first customers expected to be connected before the end of that year. The government has referred to full-fibre networks as the \u201cgold standard\u201d internet infrastructure. Ofcom points out that with the boom in streaming and downloading video, fuelled by services such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube, home broadband data usage has grown at a rate of 36% a year. \u201cOrganisations such as schools, hospitals and GP surgeries, will get these speeds for the first time,\u201d said Nick Jeffrey, Vodafone\u2019s UK chief executive. \u201cThe UK has fallen far behind the rest of the world, trapped by the limited choice available on [existing] networks. Only with gigabit fibre will the UK be able to deliver 5G services.\u201d Jeffrey cited examples of the benefits of high-speed internet: a two gigabyte CT scan sent between hospitals could be done in 40 seconds, compared with the average 14 minutes now. A five gigabyte virtual reality game would take 1.7 minutes to download, compared to 34 minutes now. And a 4K movie would download in 33 minutes, instead of 11 hours. In the move Vodafone would take on BT\u2019s Openreach, which runs the UK broadband infrastructure that rivals such as Sky and TalkTalk use, and Virgin Media, which runs its own network. Vodafone will have exclusive rights to market the new networks during construction phase, guaranteeing to take on 20% of customers, with CityFibre eventually looking to allow rivals to sell packages to consumers using its network. \u201cWith this commitment from Vodafone we have a partner with whom we can transform the digital capabilities of millions of homes and businesses,\u201d said Greg Mesch, chief executive of CityFibre. \u201cThis is a major step forward in delivering gigabit Britain.\u201d Shares in CityFibre, which in July raised \u00a3200m to fund building fibre networks, soared more than 25% following the announcement of the deal. If Vodafone\u2019s deal with CityFibre is extended to cover 5m households it will achieve 50% of the government\u2019s target of full fibre to 10m homes and businesses. The partners said they will know in a \u201cyear or two\u201d which cities beyond the first 12 will be targeted next. Openreach has been in talks with operators including Vodafone and Sky to deliver on the government\u2019s call for more full fibre. Openreach has said it will cost up to \u00a3600m and costs will be footed by price rises for consumers. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The European commission enters key Brexit talks with the government with the eurozone economy in its best shape for a decade and activity in the UK weaker than expected six months ago. In its half-yearly health check, the commission sharply cut its forecast for UK growth this year and said it was likely to continue struggling in 2018 and 2019 even on the assumption that trade would not be disrupted by its departure from the EU. Forecasts produced by economists in Brussels said the UK economy would grow by 1.5% this year rather than the 1.8% pencilled in when the last assessment was made in May. The International Monetary Fund is expecting UK growth of 1.7% this year, while the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is forecasting growth of 1.6%. Brussels believes that the UK economy will slow further to 1.3% in 2018 and 1.1% in 2019 \u2013 with growth of just 0.3% in every quarter for the next two years. It is gloomier about the outlook than the Bank of England, which expects growth of 1.7% in both years. \u201cEconomic growth in the UK has been slowing since the start of the year, as higher consumer prices constrained private consumption growth,\u201d the commission report said. \u201cBased on a purely technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK, growth is still expected to remain subdued over the forecast horizon. \u201cConsumption growth is projected to be modest, in line with weak real wage growth, while uncertainty continues to weigh on business investment. However, net exports are expected to provide some support to growth, and the labour market is projected to show continued resilience.\u201d The weakening outlook for the UK contrasts with the commission\u2019s growth upgrade for the eurozone. Helped by a pick up in the world economy and by the stimulus provided by the European Central Bank, the eurozone is expected to expand by 2.2% this year, up from 1.7% six months ago. Of the four big eurozone economies, Spain is expected to grow by 3.1% in 2017, Germany by 2.2%, France by 1.6% and Italy by 1.5%. For the eurozone as a whole, the pace of growth is expected to slacken slightly to 2.1% in 2018. The commission said the eurozone had enjoyed its best year since the start of the financial crisis a decade ago, having shaken off the debt crisis that gripped the region a couple of years ago. \u201cThe European economy has performed significantly better than expected this year, propelled by resilient private consumption, stronger growth around the world, and falling unemployment. \u201cInvestment is also picking up amid favourable financing conditions and considerably brightened economic sentiment as uncertainty has faded.\u201d Despite the pick up in growth, Europe\u2019s unemployment rate is expected to be 8.5% next year \u2013 double the rate in the UK. Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said: \u201cWe have entered a new phase of the economic recovery, with stronger growth driven by resilient consumption, the global upswing, loose financing conditions and falling unemployment.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s housing market has stalled, with fewer people looking to buy a new home and prices barely rising across the country, according to a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). Rics expects the market to remain subdued in the coming months as newly agreed sales stay flat or fall in most regions of the UK. Interest from buyers continued to drop in October, with 20% more surveyors reporting a fall in new buyer enquiries than an increase. The same proportion observed a decline in transactions over the month across the UK. The north-south divide persists: Scotland, north-east England and Wales were the only areas where sales picked up, while in the rest of the country trends were either flat or negative. Sales are expected to flatline in the next three months, and to dip over 12 months. Rics said a balance of just 1% of professionals saw prices go up nationally last month, down from 6% in September. In London, nearly two-thirds of surveyors reported a drop in prices over the month \u2013 the poorest reading since the depth of the financial crisis in 2009. In the Rics report, Neil Foster of Foster Maddison Property Consultants in Newcastle said: \u201cProlonged political uncertainty and weak direction from government is hampering sentiment among buyers and sellers. We are in for a long winter.\u201d Alan Fuller of the eponymous estate agents in Putney in south-west London, said: \u201cWe usually have buyers registering keen to move before Christmas. So far we are registering 80% less than normal during October.\u201d The Rics chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said: \u201cThe combination of the increased cost of moving, a lack of fresh stock coming to the market, uncertainty over the political climate and now an interest rate hike appears to be taking its toll on activity in the housing market.\u201d Rubinsohn said homeowners tended to stay put, while first-time buyers were focusing on the part of the market supported by the help to buy initiative. \u201cA stagnant secondhand market is bad news for the wider economy, not just in terms of spending but also because it restricts mobility,\u201d he added. The downturn in luxury housing is also continuing, the Rics report suggests: for homes valued at \u00a31m or more, nearly three-quarters of surveyors are reporting that they change hands for less than the asking price. For homes listed at between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31m, nearly two-thirds of professionals noted that sales prices were coming in lower than asking prices. In the lettings market there was little change in tenant demand in the three months to October. Rents are expected to rise by about 3.5% a year over the next five years. However, in London rents are set to fall over the next 12 months. The surveys from major mortgage lenders Halifax and Nationwide have painted a more buoyant picture of the housing market. This week Halifax reported that house prices in the UK were rising at their fastest annual pace since February, up 4.5% to a record \u00a3225,826. Nationwide\u2019s house price index also showed prices picking up in October, to an annual rate of 2.5%, the highest reading recorded in three months. Both lenders cautioned that the increase in prices was in large part caused by a shortage of homes on the market rather than a recovery in demand. In addition, low mortgage rates and high rates of employment have countered the squeeze on household incomes from stagnating wages and rising inflation. However, last week the Bank of England raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade and hinted at gradual rate rises. Brian Murphy, head of lending for mortgage broker Mortgage Advice Bureau, said: \u201cWhat one can draw from the Rics report is that if consumers are seeking to sell within the next few months, then pricing realistically is going to be key, as clearly there are still buyers out there who are motivated and want to move, but the dynamic is shifting slightly in some areas.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) also shows that the country\u2019s annual rate of property price inflation has increased to almost 13%. The findings will be seen by some as fresh evidence that the Celtic Tiger is roaring again. The figures indicate a dramatic recovery in the country\u2019s housing market following the banking crisis and property price crash of a decade ago. As recently as January 2013, residential prices in Dublin were 56% down on the highs they hit in early 2007. According to the CSO, the residential property price index has climbed to its highest level since April 2009. In the year to September, property prices at a national level increased by 12.8%. This compares with a rise of 11.8% in the year to August and is the highest annual figure since May 2015. The annual rate of price growth in Dublin was 12.4% for houses and 11.4% for flats. The west region saw the biggest annual increase at 16.5%. The CSO said prices nationally had increased by 70% since the post-banking crisis low point of early 2013. \u201cIn the same period, Dublin residential property prices have increased 87%, while residential property prices in the rest of Ireland are 61.4% higher,\u201d it added. During the period in question, the median price paid for a home was \u20ac219,999 [\u00a3194,500], though the figure for Dublin was considerably higher, at \u20ac340,000, and in one part of the Dublin region \u2013 D\u00fan Laoghaire-Rathdown \u2013 the median price paid was \u20ac510,000.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of women holding the most senior jobs in the boardrooms of Britain\u2019s biggest 100 companies has barely changed in the past 10 years, despite a series of government-backed initiatives to boost gender diversity. The analysis by Cranfield School of Management shows that the proportion of women holding the most influential non-executive positions, such as chairman and senior independent director, is just 8%, compared with 6% a decade ago. The report shows that women now hold 27.7% of directors\u2019 seats in the boardrooms of FTSE 100 companies compared with 11% in 2007, but it is largely a result of women being hired from outside to part-time non-executive roles as part of a drive to meet targets. The proportion of female chief executives is just 7% \u2013 although this has doubled over 10 years \u2013 and sparked calls for a renewed focus on promote women into executive roles, particularly at a time when the focus is on Brexit. The number of women in executive roles \u2013 employed as full-time managers in a company \u2013 has more than doubled, but is still only 10%. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of employers\u2019 body the CBI, said: \u201cToo much of the focus has been on the non-executives of listed firms, not the day-to-day leaders of our biggest businesses. And at times of great change it\u2019s all too easy to let things slip backwards. This must not be allowed be happen.\u201d The data was released alongside an update from a government-backed review, which last year set a voluntary target of 33% of FTSE 100 boardroom seats to be held by women by 2020. Sir Philip Hampton, who had been conducting the review with Dame Helen Alexander, who died in August, is now extending that target to FTSE 250 companies, where the proportion of women holding boardroom roles is currently 22.8%. \u201cWe are making progress towards the targets set out in November 2016, but it\u2019s fair to say that the pace of change will need to quicken if we are to hit the targets,\u201d said Hampton, who is chairman of pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. This year, 30% of FTSE 100 boardroom appointments have been women and 34% in the FTSE 250. This will need to increase to almost one in two boardroom appointments being women to reach the target, the Hampton-Alexander review said. For FTSE 100 boards, this is the same rate of hiring of women as over the previous three years, when they were chasing targets set by Lord Mervyn Davies, the former chief executive of Standard Chartered. In 2011, he called for the doubling of the number of women in boards in five years to 25%. The Hampton-Alexander review has also set a goal to increase female representation at executive committee management levels \u2013 just below the boardroom \u2013 by measuring 23,000 management positions in FTSE 350 companies. It has set a target of 33% women in these leadership teams in FTSE 100 companies. It is currently about 25%. Seven FTSE 100 companies have executive committees without any women, including Barclays bank and oil company BP, two household names that Hampton said he found \u201cvery surprising\u201d. This is \u201cwhere the glass ceiling is most conspicuous\u201d, he said. In the foreword to the report, Hampton said he expected companies without women on their executive committees to explain why. \u201cWe look forward to hearing cogent reasons from companies that struggle to identify women with strong executive abilities. We share the scepticism of those who also doubt that limited diversity is consistent with a meritocracy.\u201d Hampton faced criticism in July for his remarks about the BBC gender pay gap when he said women did not ask for pay rises. He said he was not trying to apportion blame for the disparities.",

      "bodyText": "Brexit will have nearly twice the impact on the economy of the north of England as it will on London, according to a new report. Northern regions are relatively more dependent on trade with the EU than the south, research from the IPPR North thinktank found. About 10.2% of the north\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of output of goods and services, is dependent on the EU, compared with 7.2% for inner London. The findings will prove worrying for the upper half of the country, where many areas voted to leave the EU in the referendum a year ago. The forecasts made in the thinktank\u2019s annual assessment of the regional economy, State of the North 2017, shows how Brexit will have a major impact, especially in areas that are already struggling or stagnated. Cumbria is hardest affected in the assessment, suffering a 13.2% hit to GDP, followed by northern Lincolnshire at 12.8%. The report suggests many northern regions are 50%-60% more dependent on EU markets for their prosperity than London. Many Britons voted to leave the EU feeling the economic recovery since the financial crisis had failed to improve their lives, made worse by government cuts. However, commentators have argued the economic consequences of the vote weren\u2019t always clearly spelled out or were ignored. The IPPR North report cited one Newcastle heckler, who, when confronted with the downside of the EU vote ahead of the poll, said: \u201cThat\u2019s your bloody GDP, not ours.\u201d The annual health check also finds millennials and generation Z citizens will make up over 50% of the northern electorate for the first time by 2030. Still, the region will need 2.7 million more working-age people to support its ageing population \u2013 or for people to retire later. The report also finds more than 40% of all northern jobs are in occupations at high risk of being taken by robots or other types of automation. The report said the government should devolve further power to the north so that \u201cnorthern millennials can take charge\u201d. Luke Raikes, senior research fellow at IPPR North, said: \u201cThey already clipped Theresa May\u2019s wings in this year\u2019s general election and will have no qualms in condemning the government\u2019s watered down plans for the north of the country.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
