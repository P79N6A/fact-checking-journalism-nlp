      "bodyText": "Smith &amp; Wesson stock opened near an all-time high on Friday after five police officers were killed and seven were injured in a shooting in Dallas. The gunmaker\u2019s stock opened at $29.75 a share. Earlier this year, the stock hit a record high on 18 March, trading at $30.44 a share. That day it closed at an all-time high of $29.37. Stocks for Smith &amp; Wesson rose about 3% on Friday while stocks for fellow firearm manufacturer Sturm Ruger went up by 5%. The shares surged in anticipation of higher gun sales due to fears of stricter gun control policies following the worst mass shooting of police in US history. In addition to shares of gunmakers, shares of Taser and Digital Ally also surged on the news. The two companies make wearable video cameras worn by US police, and Taser also makes electroshock weapons used by some police. Earlier this week, the investment firm Cowen urged its clients to buy Smith &amp; Wesson stock, citing a surge in firearm background checks. More than 2.1m background checks for gun sales were conducted by the FBI in June. In June 2015, by contrast, the FBI conducted about 1.5m such checks. June was the 14th straight month in which the number of firearm background checks reached a record high for the month. According to Cowen\u2019s Cai von Rumohr, June\u2019s background check surge was a reaction to the killing of 49 people during a shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. He attributed it to \u201cgun owners buying [Modern Sporting Rifles] in anticipation of possible purchase restrictions, and handguns for personal safety\u201d. For the past four years, mass shootings have been followed by calls for tighter gun control and spikes in the value of Smith &amp; Wesson stock. Last month, Smith &amp; Wesson announced that its annual profits reached $293.8m, a 50% increase on last year\u2019s figures. The increase was attributed to surging gun sales following a wave of mass killings. Over the past 12 months, firearms accounted for $657.6m of company\u2019s sales. Overall sales reached $722.9m \u2013 an increase of 31% from the year before, the company announced. Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s sales have risen more than 200% since Barack Obama was elected president. In the year to date, shares of Smith &amp; Wesson have surged 32% and those of Sturm Ruger 13%.",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has halted plans to sell the Port Talbot steelworks and is instead working on keeping its UK business as part of a joint venture with the German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp. The announcement will be met with a mixed reaction by Tata Steel UK\u2019s 11,000 workers. While the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales is now closer to securing its survival, Tata warned that the deal could still fall apart. The company said on Friday night that it was in talks with ThyssenKrupp about combining its European steel businesses, including in the UK, but the deal requires financial support from the British government and a restructuring of Tata Steel\u2019s pension scheme. It also confirmed it would look to sell its speciality steels business, which is based in Yorkshire, and its pipe mills in Hartlepool. These sites employ around 2,000 people. The speciality steels division faces a Serious Fraud Office investigation and some of its top staff are suspended, which could complicate a sale. Tata Steel announced in March that it was considering pulling out of its UK business, sparking heavy criticism of the government for not dealing with the crisis in the steel industry. The company began a sales process for the business, and seven potential bidders were shortlisted. However, it decided to work on a deal to keep its UK concern after the government pledged to offer hundreds of millions of pounds of support and restructure the company\u2019s pension scheme. A source close to Tata Steel said the company was keen to keep the UK business but was waiting for the government to deliver on its pledge to provide support. The source said that it was time for \u201cput up or shut up\u201d from the government. Koushik Chatterjee, Tata Steel\u2019s executive director for Europe, said: \u201cIt is too early to give any assurances about the success of these talks. \u201cSuch success, especially the inclusion of the UK business in the potential joint venture, would depend on several issues, including finding a suitable outcome for the British Steel pension scheme, successful discussions with the UK trade unions and the delivery of policy initiatives and other support from the governments of the UK and Wales.\u201d Chatterjee said that creating a joint venture with another steel business would create \u201ca premium, world-class strip-steel business with the scale and scope of capabilities to compete successfully on the global stage\u201d. He said the company had considered the bids it received for the UK business but wanted to look at \u201calternative and more sustainable portfolio solutions for the European business\u201d. As a result it was talking to other steel companies, including ThyssenKrupp, although these were at a \u201cpreliminary stage\u201d. ThyssenKrupp has a longstanding interest in merging its steel business with Tata. The companies held talks about a deal earlier this year but they broke down because the German company was concerned about the losses of the UK business and its pension liabilities. Since then, the government has offered loans of up to \u00a31bn to support Tata Steel and revealed plans to restructure the pension scheme. The sharp fall in the price of sterling since the EU referendum has also helped Tata Steel UK. The slump in sterling has made Tata Steel UK\u2019s exports more attractive to buyers in Europe and elsewhere, and made it more expensive for China to export steel to Britain. However, the result of the referendum has also caused turmoil in the government, leading to concerns within Tata about whether it can win approval for state aid and the pension scheme restructuring, which needs to be enshrined in law. The latest figures show the pension scheme has a deficit of \u00a3700m and liabilities of almost \u00a315bn. The government has drawn up a plan with trustees and trade unions that would see the scheme spun off into a new shell company and the inflation-linked annual increase benchmarked against the consumer price index rather than the retail price index, potentially saving billions of pounds in future liabilities. However, the Pension Protection Fund and some MPs have said this could create a dangerous precedent and encourage other companies to walk away from their pension liabilities. A consultation on the changes finished last month, but the government is yet to make a further announcement.",

    "webTitle": "Tina Green: Lady of leisure or 'blonde hurricane' of a formidable partnership?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Tina Green first met her future husband, Philip Green, at a party in 1985 she thought he was \u201cdreadful\u201d. At the time Christina Palos, as she was known, was running a London boutique called Harabels in Knightsbridge. When she explained to her future husband what she did, he told her that he had never heard of it. \u201cI thought, what an arrogant man,\u201d she said in a rare newspaper interview. The next day, they met again at another party, hosted by a mutual friend. Tina says she noticed that Philip had a crooked bow tie and went up to him to straighten it. \u201cIt was the oddest thing,\u201d she would later say. \u201cI thought \u2018I\u2019m in trouble here\u2019. I just fell in love with him that moment.\u201d Five years later they married, forming a formidable partnership that would go on to dominate high streets in Britain in the early 21st century. In 2006 they became Lady and Sir, when Philip was knighted for services to retail. Now however, their behaviour is under the spotlight like never before. The collapse of BHS, which the Greens controlled for 15 years, has raised awkward questions about their tax status, morals, and business acumen. Lady Green was this week forced to defend the family\u2019s use of tax havens after MPs investigating the demise of BHS asked her to explain the \u201ccomplex web\u201d of companies behind their retail empire. In a letter to the parliamentary committee behind the investigation, Lady Green outlined the details of 11 companies in which she or her wider family hold the controlling stake. The majority were incorporated in Jersey and the British Virgin Islands. On the reason why they are based there, she said: \u201cMy understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes and well respected regulators and the size and competence of their professional communities.\u201d However, these offshore locations had tax benefits too. The couple, along with their children Brandon and Chloe, moved to Monaco in 1998. Sir Philip told MPs last month that he left the UK because of a heart scare and \u201csomebody suggested\u201d that Monaco would be a good place to live. \u201cI wanted to put my children in school somewhere, and I had two or three choices. We went there, had a look, met the people and decided to stay there,\u201d he explained. When Sir Philip came back to Britain in 2000 to buy BHS, the investments were made through his wife, who remained in Monaco. Today Lady Green remains the controlling party of Taveta, the family\u2019s investment company. Taveta owns Arcadia, the retail business behind Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and a host of other high street brands. In 2005, Lady Green collected a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia, the biggest in British corporate history. No tax was paid on the dividend because of her Monaco base. The same goes for the family\u2019s share of the estimated \u00a3586m that was paid out of BHS to the Greens and other investors in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of the retailer. In total, the Greens have amassed an estimated \u00a33.2bn fortune and are ranked as the 29th richest people in the UK on the Sunday Times Rich List. However, those close to Lady Green insist she is not just a nominal owner on behalf of her husband. Friends say she is shrewd, ambitious, and has an extremely sharp eye for design and business. Lady Green once said that Sir Philip \u201cdoes nothing without consulting me\u201d. She co-founded Green &amp; Mingarelli Design, which has done interior designs for private jets, luxury yachts, and apartments in London and Monaco. Lady Green also designed a homeware line for Lalique, the crystal glassmaker. She insists that she enjoys looking after the rest of the family, including her husband. \u201cI loved being a homemaker, looking after Philip and the children, and to this day, I still love doing anything for him \u2013 cooking, putting away his clothes,\u201d she told the Sunday Times in 2014. \u201cWomen are women, and men are men. Does looking after your man take feminism back to the 1950s? Bullshit.\u201d However, Lady Green also enjoys the glamorous side of life in Monaco. She was recently photographed inspecting the family\u2019s new yacht \u2013 the \u00a3100m Lionheart \u2013 and is a fixture on the party and dinner scene in the principality. The birthday presents she had bought her husband include a \u00a37m Gulfstream jet and a \u00a3250,000 gold Monopoly set. Lady Green\u2019s age is shrouded in secrecy, like much of her early life, and she is notoriously reluctant to reveal it. However, she is thought to be in her late 60s. She was born in England \u2013 despite a Wikipedia page claiming she was born in South Africa \u2013 but travelled the world while she was young, as her father worked in the wine trade. She met her first husband, Robert \u2013 or Bobby \u2013 Palos, a South African jazz musician, in Hong Kong when she was 17. They were married a year later. The couple travelled around Japan and Australia, before moving to Johannesburg. Lady Green and Palos, who was 14 years older than her, had two children, Stasha and Brett, who is a director of Arcadia. They opened a clothes shop in South Africa and expanded the business abroad. She credits the growth of the business as one of the reasons why the couple grew apart, saying that he \u201cwasn\u2019t driven in the same way I was\u201d. The couple divorced after 20 years together. Sir Philip and Lady Green rarely talk about their private life or their own relationship. However, when they do, both have let it be known that they believe the UK has become jealous of wealth. Lady Green says there is only one secret to their success \u2013 hard work. Stasha, her daughter, describes her as a hurricane. \u201cMost of the people who judge mum don\u2019t know her,\u201d she told the Sunday Times in 2014 in the same interview as Lady Green. \u201cShe created her own success and built her own dreams. She\u2019s a blonde hurricane, and I\u2019m so lucky to have this tough independent little lady as my mum.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Tina Green first met her future husband, Philip Green, at a party in 1985 she thought he was \u201cdreadful\u201d. At the time Christina Palos, as she was known, was running a London boutique called Harabels in Knightsbridge. When she explained to her future husband what she did, he told her that he had never heard of it. \u201cI thought, what an arrogant man,\u201d she said in a rare newspaper interview.</p> <p>The next day, they met again at another party, hosted by a mutual friend. Tina says she noticed that Philip had a crooked bow tie and went up to him to straighten it. \u201cIt was the oddest thing,\u201d she would later say. \u201cI thought \u2018I\u2019m in trouble here\u2019. I just fell in love with him that moment.\u201d Five years later they married, forming a formidable partnership that would go on to dominate high streets in Britain in the early 21st century. In 2006 they became Lady and Sir, when Philip was knighted for services to retail.</p> <p>Now however, their behaviour is under the spotlight like never before. The collapse of BHS, which the Greens controlled for 15 years, has raised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/29/philip-green-family-bhs-mp-frank-field\">awkward questions about their tax status, morals, and business acumen.</a> Lady Green was this week<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bhs-tina-green-denies-family-firms-are-based-offshore-for-tax-reasons\"> forced to defend the family\u2019s use of tax havens</a> after MPs investigating the demise of BHS asked her to explain the \u201ccomplex web\u201d of companies behind their retail empire.</p> <p>In a letter to the parliamentary committee behind the investigation, Lady Green outlined the details of 11 companies in which she or her wider family hold the controlling stake. The majority were incorporated in Jersey and the British Virgin Islands. On the reason why they are based there, she said: \u201cMy understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes and well respected regulators and the size and competence of their professional communities.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/29/philip-green-family-bhs-mp-frank-field\">Philip Green's family accused of 'nicking money' from BHS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, these offshore locations had tax benefits too. The couple, along with their children Brandon and Chloe, moved to Monaco in 1998. Sir Philip told MPs last month that he left the UK because of a heart scare and \u201csomebody suggested\u201d that Monaco would be a good place to live. \u201cI wanted to put my children in school somewhere, and I had two or three choices. We went there, had a look, met the people and decided to stay there,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>When Sir Philip came back to Britain in 2000 to buy BHS, the investments were made through his wife, who remained in Monaco. Today Lady Green remains the controlling party of Taveta, the family\u2019s investment company. Taveta owns Arcadia, the retail business behind Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and a host of other high street brands.</p> <p>In 2005, Lady Green collected a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia, the biggest in British corporate history. No tax was paid on the dividend because of her Monaco base. The same goes for the family\u2019s share of the estimated \u00a3586m that was paid out of BHS to the Greens and other investors in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of the retailer. In total, the Greens have amassed an estimated \u00a33.2bn fortune and are ranked as the 29th richest people in the UK on the Sunday Times Rich List<em tabindex=\"-1\">.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"157e6f49faa1eb5d8c1e7b757dd0c8280031c4a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/157e6f49faa1eb5d8c1e7b757dd0c8280031c4a2/0_93_2391_1434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip and Lady Green at a benefit party in the Standard hotel, New York, in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip and Lady Green at a benefit party in the Standard hotel, New York, in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BFA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, those close to Lady Green insist she is not just a nominal owner on behalf of her husband. Friends say she is shrewd, ambitious, and has an extremely sharp eye for design and business. Lady Green once said that Sir Philip \u201cdoes nothing without consulting me\u201d. </p> <p>She co-founded Green &amp; Mingarelli Design, which has done interior designs for private jets, luxury yachts, and apartments in London and Monaco. Lady Green also designed a homeware line for Lalique, the crystal glassmaker. She insists that she enjoys looking after the rest of the family, including her husband. \u201cI loved being a homemaker, looking after Philip and the children, and to this day, I still love doing anything for him \u2013 cooking, putting away his clothes,\u201d she told the Sunday Times in 2014. \u201cWomen are women, and men are men. Does looking after your man take feminism back to the 1950s? Bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>However, Lady Green also enjoys the glamorous side of life in Monaco. She was recently photographed inspecting the family\u2019s new yacht \u2013 the \u00a3100m Lionheart \u2013 and is a fixture on the party and dinner scene in the principality. The birthday presents she had bought her husband include a \u00a37m Gulfstream jet and a \u00a3250,000 gold Monopoly set.</p> <p>Lady Green\u2019s age is shrouded in secrecy, like much of her early life, and she is notoriously reluctant to reveal it. However, she is thought to be in her late 60s. She was born in England \u2013 despite a Wikipedia page claiming she was born in South Africa \u2013 but travelled the world while she was young, as her father worked in the wine trade. She met her first husband, Robert \u2013 or Bobby \u2013 Palos, a South African jazz musician, in Hong Kong when she was 17. They were married a year later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bhs-tina-green-denies-family-firms-are-based-offshore-for-tax-reasons\">BHS: Tina Green denies family firms are based offshore for tax reasons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The couple travelled around Japan and Australia, before moving to Johannesburg. Lady Green and Palos, who was 14 years older than her, had two children, Stasha and Brett, who is a director of Arcadia. They opened a clothes shop in South Africa and expanded the business abroad. She credits the growth of the business as one of the reasons why the couple grew apart, saying that he \u201cwasn\u2019t driven in the same way I was\u201d. The couple divorced after 20 years together.</p> <p>Sir Philip and Lady Green rarely talk about their private life or their own relationship. However, when they do, both have let it be known that they believe the UK has become jealous of wealth. Lady Green says there is only one secret to their success \u2013 hard work.</p> <p>Stasha, her daughter, describes her as a hurricane. \u201cMost of the people who judge mum don\u2019t know her,\u201d she told the Sunday Times in 2014 in the same interview as Lady Green. \u201cShe created her own success and built her own dreams.

Barroso, who was president of the European commission for 10 years until 2014, is becoming chairman of Goldman Sachs International \u2013 the bank\u2019s UK and European operations \u2013 and will also be an adviser. His pay has not been disclosed. He replaces Ireland\u2019s former attorney general Peter Sutherland who left in May 2015 and whose position had been temporarily filled by the Swedish businessman Claes Dahlback, another non-executive director. Barroso joins Goldman Sachs as the investment bank is not only tackling Brexit but is also facing questions about its involvement in BHS, the retailer that collapsed in April. It is also fighting a court case brought by the Libyan Investment Authority for losses on trades during the 2008 financial crisis. He told the Financial Times (\u00a3) that one of the most difficult elements in the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations would be over passporting rights \u2013 the ability to trade from the UK across to what will now be a 27 nation bloc. \u201cWhat I know for sure is that on both sides it will be intelligent and wise to have a fair negotiation,\u201d he told the FT. \u201cNobody wins from a confrontation.\u201d He said he would attempt to mitigate the negative effects of the referendum result. \u201cOf course I know well the EU, I also know relatively well the UK environment,\u201d Barroso said. \u201cIf my advice can be helpful in this circumstance I\u2019m ready to contribute, of course.\u201d During his final period of tenure at the commission, Barroso was critical of David Cameron\u2019s handling of the EU and the prime minister\u2019s ambitions to impose a cap on immigrants from eastern Europe. While he was head of the commission, Barroso was at heart of the banking crisis and the ensuing fallout which gripped the eurozone. He has been critical of the behaviour of banks. \u201cAs president of the EC, I was leading an overall effort of regulation and supervision, including the creation of banking union in the euro area, to bring back stability, credibility to the financial sector,\u201d Barroso told the FT. Before taking the EC role, Barroso was prime minister of Portugal between 2002 and 2004. The co-heads of Goldman Sachs International, Michael Sherwood and Richard Gnodde, said that Barroso had been hired for his understanding of Europe. \u201cWe look forward to working with him as we continue to help our clients navigate the challenging and uncertain economic and market environment,\u201d they said in a joint statement.",

    "webTitle": "Brexit fallout \u2013 the economic impact in six key charts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s surprise decision to quit the European Union at the 23 June referendum sent shockwaves across global markets, triggered a political crisis in the UK, and pushed the economy into uncharted waters. Here are six key charts that show the immediate impact of the Brexit vote: 1 The pound has fallen sharply against the dollar As markets woke up on 24 June to news of the British vote to leave the EU, the pound fell to a 31-year low against the dollar. In the following days sterling slipped further against the US currency as fears about Britain\u2019s economic outlook intensified and traders bet on lower UK interest rates. Ending last week at around $1.29, the pound still has some way to go to hit its 1985 low of $1.05. However, some commentators have warned sterling could yet slump to parity with the dollar. Among them, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to the investment company Allianz, who said sterling\u2019s fate depended on the British government developing a credible plan B. \u201cThe future value of sterling is a function of how quickly the structural uncertainty is resolved \u2013 if plan B is delayed and/or it doesn\u2019t involve much of a free trade setup with the EU, it is not inconceivable for sterling to head to parity with the US dollar,\u201d he told Reuters. 2 Sterling has also tumbled against the euro It\u2019s bad news for holidaymakers heading to the eurozone this summer, with the pound down more than 10% against the euro since the Brexit vote. On the day of the referendum \u00a31 was worth \u20ac1.30 \u2013 now it is worth \u20ac1.17. It is not just holidaymakers hurt by a weaker pound against the euro. Although it makes UK exporters\u2019 products and services more competitive a weaker pound makes imports from the single currency bloc more expensive and that could stoke UK inflation. 3 The FTSE 100 initially fell but later recovered The FTSE 100 had rallied ahead of the referendum on bets that Britons would vote to remain. When the leave result was confirmed the index initially slumped. Losses were tempered, however, by reassuring words from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. His heavy hints that interest rates will be cut helped the index of the biggest London-listed companies recover in days following the vote. The FTSE 100 is now at around 6,556, compared with a close of 6,338.10 on the day of the referendum. The index has also had significant support from shares in those companies that report a large chunk of earnings in dollars. As the pound falls against the dollar their earnings have been flattered. Mining firms too have been bolstered by a rise in the gold price, seen as a safe haven for investors in times of trouble. Other sectors on the index have fared far worse. Shares in housebuilders and most banks \u2013 all seen as particularly vulnerable to a Brexit-related downturn \u2013 are down markedly since the referendum. 4 The FTSE 250 fell and is still below its pre-Brexit vote level The FTSE 250 index of midcap firms is seen as a better reflection of UK prospects. The index, more domestically focused than the FTSE 100, slumped 7% on the day the referendum outcome was confirmed. Unlike the FTSE 100, this index of smaller firms has not recovered all its Brexit-related losses. On Friday it rose to 16,130, still down 7% from 17,334 on the day of the referendum. 5 Gilt yields have dropped to record lows as investors seek safer assets Government bonds in the the UK and elsewhere have been in demand since the referendum as investors ditch assets like shares and seek out safer investments amid worries about the impact of Brexit on an already fragile global economy. As a result, yields \u2013 which move inversely to prices of bonds \u2013 have fallen. The yields on UK government bonds, also known as gilts, have set record lows in the wake of the referendum. The yield on 10-year gilts now stands at 0.778%, having almost halved from 1.376% on 23 June. 6. Banking shares took a hammering on sector health fears Investors have been offloading shares in UK and other European banks on worries about the economic outlook and their likely profitably in uncertain times. The FTSE 350 index of bank shares is down 11% since the referendum. The prospect of official interest rates falling even further from their record lows is bad news for banks. Low interest rates make it harder for banks to make a profit on the difference between the rates that are paid on savings and the rates that can be charged on loans. At the same time, there are concerns banks could come under strain from a rise in bad debts if the housing market slows markedly or unemployment rises, making it difficult for customers to maintain their loan repayments. Banks also face the prospect of losses on their loans to commercial property developers. The sector has come under scrutiny following the Brexit vote on fears commercial property prices could fall. Banks also use commercial property to count towards their capital buffers; at the end of 2015 around 55% of their core capital \u2013 their main safety net in a crisis \u2013 was based on commercial property.",

In the following days sterling slipped further against the US currency as fears about Britain\u2019s economic outlook intensified and traders bet on lower UK interest rates. </p> <p>Ending last week at around $1.29, the pound still has some way to go to hit its 1985 low of $1.05. However, some commentators have warned sterling could yet slump to parity with the dollar. Among them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mohamed-el-erian\">Mohamed El-Erian</a>, chief economic adviser to the investment company Allianz, who said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/07/pound-dollar-brexit-politicians-city-stock-markets-retail-live?page=with:block-577df5a0e4b04e08d34e309b#block-577df5a0e4b04e08d34e309b\">sterling\u2019s fate depended on the British government developing a credible plan B</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe future value of sterling is a function of how quickly the structural uncertainty is resolved \u2013 if plan B is delayed and/or it doesn\u2019t involve much of a free trade setup with the EU, it is not inconceivable for sterling to head to parity with the US dollar,\u201d he told Reuters.</p> <h2>2 Sterling has also tumbled against the euro</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2016-07-08T13:33:02/embed.html\" data-alt=\"pound v euro\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2016-07-08T13:33:02/embed.html\">pound v euro</a> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s bad news for holidaymakers heading to the eurozone this summer, with the pound down more than 10% against the euro since the Brexit vote.

When the leave result was confirmed the index initially slumped. </p> <p>Losses were tempered, however, by reassuring words from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England </a>governor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney\">Mark Carney</a>. His heavy hints that interest rates will be cut helped the index of the biggest London-listed companies recover in days following the vote. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 is now at around 6,556, compared with a close of 6,338.10 on the day of the referendum.</p> <p>The index has also had significant support from shares in those companies that report a large chunk of earnings in dollars. As the pound falls against the dollar their earnings have been flattered. </p> <p>Mining firms too have been bolstered by a rise in the gold price, seen as a safe haven for investors in times of trouble. Other sectors on the index have fared far worse. Shares in housebuilders and most banks \u2013 all seen as particularly vulnerable to a Brexit-related downturn \u2013 are down markedly since the referendum.</p> <h2>4 The FTSE 250 fell and is still below its pre-Brexit vote level</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2016-07-08T13:31:36/embed.html\" data-alt=\"FTSE 250 is still below its pre-Brexit vote level\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2016-07-08T13:31:36/embed.html\">FTSE 250 is still below its pre-Brexit vote level</a> </figure>  <p>The FTSE 250 index of midcap firms is seen as a better reflection of UK prospects. The index, more domestically focused than the FTSE 100, slumped 7% on the day the referendum outcome was confirmed. Unlike the FTSE 100, this index of smaller firms has not recovered all its Brexit-related losses. On Friday it rose to 16,130, still down 7% from 17,334 on the day of the referendum.</p> <h2>5 Gilt yields have dropped to record lows as investors seek safer assets</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2016-07-08T13:33:31/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Gilt yields fell to record lows\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2016-07-08T13:33:31/embed.html\">Gilt yields fell to record lows</a> </figure>  <p>Government bonds in the the UK and elsewhere have been in demand since the referendum as investors ditch assets like shares and seek out safer investments amid worries about the impact of Brexit on an already fragile global economy. As a result, yields \u2013 which move inversely to prices of bonds \u2013 have fallen.<br></p> <p>The yields on UK government bonds, also known as gilts, have set record lows in the wake of the referendum. The yield on 10-year gilts now stands at 0.778%, having almost halved from 1.376% on 23 June.</p> <h2>6. Banking shares took a hammering on sector health fears</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2016-07-08T13:33:55/embed.html\" data-alt=\"banking shares fell heavily\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2016-07-08T13:33:55/embed.html\">banking shares fell heavily</a> </figure>  <p>Investors have been offloading shares in UK and other European banks on worries about the economic outlook and their likely profitably in uncertain times. The FTSE 350 index of bank shares is down 11% since the referendum. <br></p> <p>The prospect of official interest rates falling even further from their record lows is bad news for banks. Low interest rates make it harder for banks to make a profit on the difference between the rates that are paid on savings and the rates that can be charged on loans.</p> <p>At the same time, there are concerns banks could come under strain from a rise in bad debts if the housing market slows markedly or unemployment rises, making it difficult for customers to maintain their loan repayments.</p> <p>Banks also face the prospect of losses on their loans to commercial property developers. The sector has come under scrutiny following the Brexit vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/07/property-fund-turmoil-continues-as-legal-and-general-foreign-and-colonial-reveal-cut-in-value\">on fears commercial property prices could fall</a>. Banks also use commercial property to count towards their capital buffers; at the end of 2015 around 55% of their core capital \u2013 their main safety net in a crisis \u2013 was based on commercial property.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Markets are up on both sides of the Atlantic as investors breathed a collective sigh of relief when the better-than-expected US jobs report was published. In Europe, earlier gains have accelerated: FTSE 100: +1% at 6,596 FTSE 250: +1.8% at 16,178 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1.9% at 9,600 France\u2019s CAC: +1.5% at 4,180 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +3.6% at 15,989 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +2% at 8,167 The pound has held fairly steady against the dollar all day, and is now up 0.4% at $1.2953. We have had warnings from the IMF and Moody\u2019s that one of the biggest risks posed by the Brexit risk is political contagion in the rest of the EU. There were underwhelming figures from the UK, where the trade in goods deficit widened. Meanwhile Germany reported a shock fall in exports. And with Brexit jobs all the rage, Goldman Sachs has hired Jose Manuel Barroso, the former head of the European Commission, to advise on the subject. That\u2019s it for today, thank you for joining us. Have a great weekend. AM Wall Street has opened higher after non-farm payrolls jumped by 287,000 in June, the most in eight months. And the Dow Jones has now recovered all of the losses following the Brexit vote: Dow Jones: +0.7% at 18,022 S&amp;P 500: +0.6% at 2,111 Nasdaq: +0.6% at 4,905 Goldman Sachs has drafted in Jose Manuel Barroso, the former head of the European Commission, as an advisor as the impact of the Brexit vote unfolds. Barroso was president of the EC for a decade between 2004 and 2014. In a statement issued by GS, Michael Sherwood and Richard Gnodde, co-CEOs of Goldman Sachs International, commented on the high-profile appointment: Jos\u00e9 Manuel brings immense insights and experience to Goldman Sachs, including a deep understanding of Europe. We look forward to working with him as we continue to help our clients navigate the challenging and uncertain economic and market environment. Barroso also comments on his new role in an FT piece running online. He says he will do what he can to \u201cmitigate the negative effects\u201d of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Of course I know the EU well, I also know relatively well the UK environment. If my advice can be helpful in this circumstance I\u2019m ready to contribute, of course. The Guardian\u2019s Katie Allen reports: The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth outlook for the eurozone on the back of the Brexit vote, warning that a new climate of uncertainty across the single currency bloc will dent confidence, fan financial market volatility and spill over into other economies. The Fund used a regular healthcheck on the eurozone to warn it would suffer an economic slowdown and more political uncertainty as a result of last month\u2019s referendum result. It is the latest body to warn that fresh cracks could emerge in the region as it grapples with the fallout of the UK\u2019s decision to depart the EU. GDP in the eurozone is now expected to grow 1.6% this year and just 1.4% in 2017, a slowdown from a 1.7% expansion last year, \u201cmainly due to the negative impact of the UK referendum\u201d, the IMF said. That compares with IMF forecasts before the June vote of 1.7% growth for the eurozone this year and next. The IMF had repeatedly warned before the referendum of dire economic consequences from Brexit, much to the anger of leave campaigners. The IMF said: \u201cLooking ahead, the risks to the outlook remain firmly on the downside and are mainly political. Uncertainty will persist as long as the UK\u2019s new status vis-\u00e0-vis the EU is not clear. \u201cThe recommendation in the staff report that collective actions should be taken to improve the governance of the economic union and make it more cohesive remains valid, and has now taken on greater urgency.\u201d Full story here: The far stronger-than-expected non-farm payrolls were boosted in particular by job creation in leisure and hospitality, health care and social assistance, as well the financial sector. On the downside, the Labor Department figures showed the unemployment rose to 4.9% in June from 4.7% in May. So the non-farm payrolls were a major surprise on the upside. But as it turns out, last month payrolls were up just 11,000! And everyone thought the original estimate of 38,000 jobs was a shocker. Payrolls summed up nicely: US payrolls were far stronger than expected in June, rising by 287,000. It a huge leap compared with May, when 11,000 jobs were created (revised down from 38,000) and more than the 175,000 forecast by economists. More soon. Five minutes to go until non-farm payrolls. European markets are up ahead of the key US data. The FTSE 100 was down earlier but is now up 0.2% or 16 points at 6,549. Hargreaves Lansdown has commented on property funds, and the move by so many this week to block withdrawals as investors panic about the potential impact of Brexit on the property market. Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown suggests the negative view of property in the current climate might be overdone. It\u2019s been a hectic week for property funds, but as yet we don\u2019t know how deep the fault lines run. The mark down in asset prices is really an educated guess, and it may not be borne out by real world transactions, for better or worse, though with such sharp adjustments there appears to be a lot of bad news in the price. Open-ended funds investing in property clearly have limitations, but long term investors in any market should be willing to tolerate periods of weakness. Selling out when prices have fallen sharply is usually a bad idea, particularly if the decision is a knee-jerk reaction. The fundamental trends that led to the popularity of property as an asset class are still in place, with interest rates still low and gilt prices still high. Economic uncertainty casts a shadow over the sector for sure, but as yet we lack real data on what the full impact of Brexit will be. The Greek government is poised to sell \u20ac625m of three-month treasury bills on 3 July to refinance maturing debt, the country\u2019s debt agency PDMA said. The pound is up 0.6% against the dollar at $1.2984. It is also up 0.6% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1732. Barack Obama has written a piece in today\u2019s FT entitled \u201cAmerica\u2019s alliance with Britain and Europe\u201d. The US President uses the piece to say the \u201cspecial relationship between the US and the UK will endure\u201d. As he seeks to provides reassurance, his latest comments on the post-Brexit world are far more upbeat than in the run-up to the referendum, when he said the UK would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with America. As difficult as it will be, I am confident that the UK and the EU will be able to agree on an orderly transition to a new relationship, as all our countries stay focused on ensuring financial stability and growing the global economy. And, while the relationship between the UK and the EU will change, it is worth remembering what will not change. The special relationship between the US and the UK will endure... Likewise, the US will continue to have an indispensable partner in the EU. The US and the EU have the largest trade and investment relationship in the world and our co-operation will be essential to stimulating global growth and reducing inequality through public investments so that globalisation delivers opportunity for all people, not just those at the top. Europe will remain a cornerstone of America\u2019s engagement with the world. Moreover, while Brexit creates some uncertainty, our shared prosperity will continue to rest on the rock-solid foundation of Nato. Business secretary Sajid Javid is in Mumbai to meet the boss of Tata about the group\u2019s plans for its UK steel business. It is though Tata could announce that it is putting on hold its plans for a sale of the UK business. Tata announced plans to sell its UK steel operation in late March, putting 11,000 jobs at risk, including 4,000 at the strip products business in Port Talbot, south Wales. It blamed cheap Chinese imports, the depressed price of steel and high energy costs for the decision to sell the business it bought in 2007. European markets are looking a little mixed now ahead of those US payroll numbers at 1.30pm (UK time). The FTSE 100 is slightly down, while the FTSE 250 is up 1.2% at 16,092. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets says investors are hanging on to see what the jobs report brings There appears to be little incentive this morning to drive markets strongly one way or the other ahead of this afternoon\u2019s US payrolls report. We do have a slightly firmer tone with the FTSE100 underperforming somewhat due to a weaker oil price, but overall we appear to be in a holding pattern at the end of what has been a fairly turbulent week. More on the the risk of political contagion posed by the Brexit vote. Any signs of political contagion could trigger a \u201cwild\u201d reaction among investors according to NN Investments. There is no guarantee that investors\u2019 emotions will not turn wild again if signs of political contagion from the UK into mainland Europe becomes more visible, or if the needed recapitalisation of the Italian banking system remains unresolved, or if headline-grabbing newsflow of suspensions of real estate funds intensifies. The Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab will be publishing news alerts on today\u2019s US jobs report.

Some gloomy observations this morning from Moody\u2019s, which is warning that Brexit could topple the whole EU project. The ratings agency says that a weaker UK and EU economy in the wake of the Brexit vote is not the key risk to the global economy. Rather it is political contagion. The downside risks to global growth stem not from the possibility of a recession in the UK, but from the possibility that developments in the UK may give rise to increased political risk elsewhere in the EU. In the long run, the potential strengthening of nationalistic and protectionist movements could have a detrimental effect on the EU, even threatening its existence. The fragmentation of the trade bloc could also encourage protectionist tendencies in other countries, potentially halting the past few decades of increasing globalisation. This in turn would damage the long-term growth prospects of individual economies. The EU economy represents roughly a quarter of global GDP, making it systemically important to the world economy and the US. Therefore, if the negative risks in the EU materialize, it would have a significant consequences for global trade and growth. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, is underwhelmed by the UK trade performance, describing it as \u201cdisappointing\u201d. He makes the point that very little progress is being made towards rebalancing the economy - a long-held ambition of George Osborne - away from domestic consumer spending and towards exports. May\u2019s UK trade figures are a further sign of the unbalanced nature of the economic recovery. Looking ahead, the 10% or so fall in trade-weighted sterling since the referendum should help to boost exports in time. Although any improvement is likely to be slow against a background of fairly sluggish global growth and uncertainty about future trade relationships between the UK and other countries. The reason behind the rise in the UK\u2019s goods deficit is that exports fell more sharply than imports in May. Exports fell by \u00a32.1bn to \u00a323.7bn in May, while imports fell by 1.6bn to \u00a333.5bn according to the Over a three-month period however, the trade deficit narrowed by \u00a32.5bn to \u00a38.2bn. Britain\u2019s trade position with the EU improved slightly over the three months, narrowing by \u00a3100m to \u00a322.5bn as exports increased by more than imports. Outside the EU, things also looked better, with a 6.8% increase in exports pushing the deficit down \u00a32.6bn to \u00a38.2bn. The hope is that the weaker pound will drive exports higher because British-made goods will be cheaper abroad. But on the flip side, it makes imports more expensive, which could lead to a rise in prices in UK shops. The UK trade in goods deficit widened slightly in May, to \u00a39.9bn from \u00a39.4bn in April. The figure for April was a downward revision from an earlier estimate of a \u00a310.5bn goods deficit. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has a take on the markets this morning: It was a fairly typical start to a non-farm Friday for the European indices, which have little to occupy themselves with until this afternoon\u2019s US data dump. At most rising by 10 points the FTSE continued to hover around the 6550 mark this morning, that level having become the UK index\u2019s safe space for much of the week. The pound was similarly settled (it\u2019s all relative) at the start of Friday, trading just above $1.29 against dollar and \u20ac1.165 against the euro. UK trade data is coming up. The goods deficit with the rest of the world is expected to widen slightly to \u00a310.65bn in May from \u00a310.52bn in April. The figures should be out at 9.30. German exports fell at the sharpest rate in nine months in May. It was an unexpected drop, and a weaker than expected rise in exports was another sign that demand is slowing in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Exports fell by 1.8% over the month, following a 0.1% rise in April. Imports increased by 0.1%, so Germany\u2019s trade balance narrowed to \u20ac22.1bn from \u20ac24.1bn in April. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, says it tops off a bad week for Germany, both in economic and footballing terms... Another indicator signalling that Germany\u2019s performance is currently not champion-like. Today\u2019s trade data mark the end of a disappointing week for the German industry. All May data point to a sharp slowdown of the German industry. Probably the entire batch of industrial data will not get the attention it deserves. Germany will be mainly busy digesting and analysing its own exit; the exit from the Euro2016, the European Soccer Championships. However, to offer some solace: if there is any economic impact from soccer, last night\u2019s result was the best possible outcome for the eurozone: stimulus and psychological support for France, while at the same time Germany can still feel superior. Markets are steady this morning, with no big lurches in the pound or equities. But European shares are on track for their worst week in five months. Following a rebound in the week immediately after the Brexit vote, investors appear to have taken a step back this week. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says that some harsh realities have been sinking in: It\u2019s been a strange week for equity markets with heavy falls for European markets reversing a lot of the gains that we saw in the week post Brexit, though US markets and the FTSE100 have stood out as outperforming, and managing to hang on to a good proportion of their gains thus far this week. Having got caught up in the euphoria of the prospect of lower for a lot longer interest rates, investors forgot about the vulnerability of the European banking system and its sclerotic banks and soon saw the error of their ways, smashing the Italian banking sector, as well as Swiss giants UBS and Credit Suisse and German giant Deutsche Bank to new record all-time lows. Markets are not exactly off to a flying start this morning, as investors await the main event of the day from the US at 1.30pm (UK time), when the June payrolls report will be published. The FTSE 100 is up 8 points. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 6,542 FTSE 250: +0.03% at 15,9047 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 9,409 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 4,112 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: 0.4% at 15,506 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.04% at 8,005 A report published overnight shows consumer sentiment has taken a hammering in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. GfK\u2019s long-running index of consumer confidence dropped eight points to -9 in a special report to measure sentiment after the vote. It was the sharpest drop in 21 years. A breakdown of responses showed that people who voted to remain in the EU were feeling the least confident, at -13, while leavers were less pessimistic at -5. GfK noted a fall across all the survey\u2019s key indicators, including the outlook for household finances and people\u2019s appetite for splashing out on major purchases. Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK: In these extraordinary times this one-off Brexit special gauges the temperature of consumer confidence right now. During this period of uncertainty, we\u2019ve seen a very significant drop in confidence, as is clear from the fact that every one of our key measures has fallen, with the biggest decrease occurring in the outlook for the general economic situation in the next 12 months. Read our full story on the report here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The main focus of the day is the US payrolls report for June. The report has particular significance this month following an absolute shocker last month, when it emerged the number of jobs added in May was just 38,000. Economists were expecting a 164,000 increase in jobs... It was the weakest growth in jobs since September 2010, and the numbers for March and April were also revised down. Investors will be looking for improvement in today\u2019s numbers, and hoping the sharp slowdown in May was just a blip. Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting a 175,000 increase in payrolls in June. If the number comes in strong, the expectation will be that the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner rather than later, possibly in September. Another shockingly weak number would raise concerns that a worrying trend is emerging in the US labour market, putting a rate rise off the table for the time being. The Fed is, of course, weighing up other factors, not least what impact Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU will have on the US economy. Meanwhile the pound is settled at the moment, hovering around $1.29 and currently at $1.2934. Also coming up today we have UK trade data for May. Although it covers the period before the referendum on 23 June, it will serve as a timely reminder of Britain\u2019s current trade position with the rest of the world. The IMF will publish its latest take on the eurozone at 2pm UK time. We will bring you all the latest developments as they happen.",

    "webTitle": "IMF cuts growth predictions for eurozone over post-Brexit confusion", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth outlook for the eurozone on the back of the Brexit vote, warning that a new climate of uncertainty across the single currency bloc will dent confidence, fan financial market volatility and spill over into other economies. The Fund used a regular healthcheck on the eurozone to warn it would suffer an economic slowdown and more political uncertainty as a result of last month\u2019s referendum result. It is the latest body to warn that fresh cracks could emerge in the region as it grapples with the fallout of the UK\u2019s decision to depart the EU. GDP in the eurozone is now expected to grow 1.6% this year and just 1.4% in 2017, a slowdown from a 1.7% expansion last year, \u201cmainly due to the negative impact of the UK referendum\u201d, the IMF said. That compares with IMF forecasts before the June vote of 1.7% growth for the eurozone this year and next. The IMF had repeatedly warned before the referendum of dire economic consequences from Brexit, much to the anger of leave campaigners. In its latest comments, the Washington-based fund highlighted the UK\u2019s importance as a trading partner for the eurozone as the destination for 13% of euro area exports. \u201cThe markdowns for the euro area reflect likely weaker investor confidence on account of heightened uncertainty, greater financial market volatility, and lower import demand from the UK. \u201cGiven the euro area\u2019s substantial weight in world trade, this slowdown would have spillovers to many other economies, including emerging markets but the impact is expected to be limited. \u201cLooking ahead, the risks to the outlook remain firmly on the downside and are mainly political. Uncertainty will persist as long as the UK\u2019s new status vis-a\u0300-vis the EU is not clear. The recommendation in the staff report that collective actions should be taken to improve the governance of the economic union and make it more cohesive remains valid, and has now taken on greater urgency.\u201d The UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU heaps fresh pressure on the eurozone project less than a year after debt-ridden Greece came close to tumbling out of the currency union. Grexit was narrowly avoided but the IMF warns prolonged low growth and inflation have left the euro area increasingly vulnerable to shocks. The bloc will also remain prone to recurrent crises of confidence unless political leaders pull together, it says. Earlier on Friday, a leading credit ratings agency also warned of political shockwaves from Brexit. Moody\u2019s said the UK\u2019s vote could even topple the whole EU project. \u201cIn the long run, the potential strengthening of nationalistic and protectionist movements could have a detrimental effect on the EU, even threatening its existence,\u201d it said, in an update to financial markets. Even before the referendum, the IMF was warning about political tensions in the region and its managing director Christine Lagarde had flagged up risks from economic nationalism and inequality. That theme was reprised in the Fund\u2019s \u201carticle 4\u201d annual report into the 19-nation eurozone, written just before the UK\u2019s 23 June referendum. The report was published on Friday alongside a supplementary note with the lower growth outlook written after the referendum. The IMF\u2019s experts wrote: \u201cGrowing political divisions and skepticism have put the euro area at a critical juncture. The usual approach of muddling through appears increasingly untenable, raising the risks of stagnation and further fragmentation.\u201d Downside risks to the eurozone\u2019s growth prospects had increased, amid \u201cgrowing political divisions and euroscepticism\u201d, the IMF said. Medium-term prospects remained weak, with high public and private debt and slow progress in structural reforms weighing on growth. With interest rates in the eurozone already at record lows, the European Central Bank pumping in electronic money and government finances stretched, the IMF warned there was \u201cvery little policy space to cope with adverse shocks\u201d. It urged more \u201ccollective actions\u201d from governments to strengthen the currency union.

It is the latest body to warn that fresh cracks could emerge in the region as it grapples with the fallout of the UK\u2019s decision to depart the EU. </p> <p>GDP in the eurozone is now expected to grow 1.6% this year and just 1.4% in 2017, a slowdown from a 1.7% expansion last year, \u201cmainly due to the negative impact of the UK referendum\u201d, the IMF said.

      "bodyText": "The US economy added 287,000 jobs in June \u2013 exceeding expectations after two months of disappointing job growth. The unemployment rate went up to 4.9%, the Department of Labor announced on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected 175,000 jobs to be added in June and the unemployment rate to go up to 4.8% \u2013 up from 4.7% a month ago. Friday\u2019s report comes just days after the Federal Reserve released notes from its June meeting. In June, the US central bank decided for the fourth time this year not to raise US interest rates. In December, the Fed raised rates for the first time in almost a decade. June\u2019s decision to hold off on raising interest rates from the current range of 0.25% to 0.5% was attributed to slowing job growth and the then upcoming vote by the UK on whether it should leave the European Union. May\u2019s initial jobs report found that the US economy had added a meager 38,000 jobs \u2013 about 122,000 fewer than expected. The disappointing number was blamed on the 44-day strike by 40,000 Verizon workers, most of whose jobs are subtracted from the total while they are on strike. The strike finished at the end of May. Despite expectations of upward revisions, on Friday, the Department of Labor revised May\u2019s figure from 38,000 jobs to 11,000. \u201cThe employment gain in June was hefty, but it follows a very weak May and was not confirmed by strength in the household survey. Job growth in the quarter averaged just 151,000,\u201d said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial. \u201cFrom here, we need to see further gains in manufacturing and construction as well as broader gains in services \u2013 growth in healthcare and leisure alone won\u2019t cut it \u2013 before we are comfortable calling a turn for the better in the employment trend.\u201d Last month, the leisure and hospitality industry added 59,000 jobs and healthcare added 39,000 jobs. However, mining continued to lose jobs. In June, the industry lost another 6,000 jobs. Since its peak in September 2014, mining has lost 211,000 jobs, according to the Department of Labor. In June, hourly earnings went up by 2 cents to $25.61 an hour. The annualized rate of wage growth for the past 12 months has reached 2.6%. Earlier this year, Barack Obama touted the fact that so far this year, wages have grown at a rate of about 3%, which he said was still \u201ctoo slow\u201d. The Fed was also concerned about the number of part-time workers. \u201cThe share of workers employed part time for economic reasons rose noticeably in May,\u201d according to the notes from June\u2019s meeting. The number of those who wanted full-time jobs but were only able to find part-time jobs was 5.8m in June, down from 6.4m in May, just barely offsetting the increase in involuntary part-time labor the month prior. \u201cAlthough the rate of private-sector job openings remained elevated, the rate of hires declined in both March and April and the rate of quits was unchanged.\u201d A high number of Americans leaving their jobs means that they are confident they can find a new job and are optimistic about the US jobs market: The number of people quitting their jobs was 828,000 in June, slightly up from 796,000 in May. The job growth rebound recorded in June might be enough to assuage the Fed\u2019s fears about the weakening job market, according to Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cToday\u2019s report helps the case for more Fed tightening before too long \u2013 if strength is sustained \u2013 although officials are being ultra cautious amidst turmoil in global markets,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cThe Fed will almost certainly remain on hold at the 26 to 27 July meeting.\u201d Despite the positive job growth, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon, advised caution in the coming months. The June report reflected pre-Brexit vote data, he noted. The UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union \u201cwill hurt manufacturing exporters\u201d, he said, adding that the jobs report had a margin of error of more than 100,000 jobs and \u201ccould be revised down substantially\u201d next month.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fund managers are being warned by the City regulator not to embark on fire sales of office blocks and shopping centres to meet the demands of customers trying to cash in investments from property funds. Since the EU referendum on 23 June, more than half a dozen commercial property fundshave taken steps to adapt to the changing economic backdrop. Some have prevented customers withdrawing their cash by suspending trading; others have announced fund devaluations, including Aberdeen Asset Management, which devalued by by 17%. The Financial Conduct Authority reissued guidance to remind the investment industry of their duty to treat all customers fairly \u2013 including those who want to remain in a fund. \u201cIt is the duty of the fund manager to ensure that assets are valued fairly and accurately and to ensure that any subscriptions or redemptions of units take place at a fair price. Failure to do so may lead to some investors gaining at the expense of other investors in the same fund,\u201d the FCA said. \u201cIf a fund has to dispose of underlying assets in order to meet an unusually high volume of redemption requests, the manager must ensure these disposals are carried out in a way that does not disadvantage investors who remain in the fund or are newly investing in it,\u201d the regulator added. Its new chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said earlier this week that the structure of these funds \u2013 which offer instant redemption on assets that are difficult to sell \u2013 might need to be reviewed. The commercial property sector has been a focus since the Brexit vote and there are predictions that some properties could fall by 20% in the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Analysis by brokers at UBS found that some Brexit clauses were being triggered in commercial property transactions, causing some deals to fall through. UBS also expects the outlook to remain uncertain until negotiations over passporting rights \u2013 which give firms in the City of London the ability to transact across the EU\u2013 are finalised. The UBS analysts said they expected London office values to fall by 20% \u2013 an increase on their previous 15% estimate. Falls in the price of other commercial properties would not be so large. But, they said: \u201cAt this early stage, there is limited evidence to point towards, to assess the potential magnitude of the impact on the commercial real estate market.\u201d The analysts said: \u201cWe have heard of some so-called Brexit clauses being triggered, causing deals to fall through. The long-term demand picture in London is uncertain as banks investigate the potential impact of a withdrawal of passporting rights, while the near-term outlook is also difficult. So the direction is certainly down, but the magnitude is uncertain.\u201d The scale of the fall is not expected to reach the 44% decline that took place from 2007-09 when the financial crisis was at its peak.

The business secretary is in Mumbai, where Tata is due to hold its monthly board meeting, and will hold talks with Cyrus Mistry, Tata\u2019s chairman. Tata may announce that the sale of Tata Steel UK has been put on hold. Tata announced plans to sell its UK steel operation in late March, putting 11,000 jobs at risk, including 4,000 at the strip products business in Port Talbot, south Wales. It blamed cheap Chinese imports, the depressed price of steel and high energy costs for the decision to sell the business it bought in 2007. When the sale was announced the business was said to be losing \u00a31m a day but cost-cutting, a partial recovery in the steel price and the pound\u2019s plunge on currency markets have made the business more viable. The UK government has promised a package of support including a loan of up to \u00a31bn and possible joint ownership. About 40,000 jobs are thought to rely on the business, including those in its supply chain. Some bidders have pulled out due to the economic uncertainty following Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, Bloomberg reported, although Javid\u2019s department apparently has not been told about any withdrawals. The situation has been further confused by Tata considering the sale of its speciality steels and pipeline tube businesses if it decides to stay in the UK. The operations employ 2,500 people in Rotherham, Hartlepool and Stocksbridge, near Sheffield. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP whose Aberavon constituency includes Port Talbot, has called on Javid and Tata to clear up questions about the sale process and set clear objectives. He has demanded that Javid make a statement to parliament on Monday when he returns from India. Javid was left embarrassed in March because he was in Australia when Tata announced the sale, while Kinnock and trade unions travelled to Mumbai in an attempt to persuade the company to keep the UK business open. He flew to Mumbai to meet Mistry in early April and again in May, when the company was compiling a shortlist of bidders.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hammerson has paid \u00a31bn to take control of Dundrum Town Centre, Ireland\u2019s biggest shopping centre, in a deal the property developer said was attractive amid the uncertainty engulfing the UK after the vote to leave the EU. This is the first move into the Dublin shopping market for Hammerson, one of the UK\u2019s largest commercial real estate companies. Hammerson\u2019s decision highlights the turnaround in Ireland\u2019s economy, which has revived strongly since the country was bailed out in 2010 after the financial crisis, becoming Europe\u2019s fastest growing economy last year. The recovery has been helped by the fall in the value of the euro and Ireland\u2019s continuing appeal as an English-speaking, low-tax entry point for international companies in Europe. Hammerson said Ireland\u2019s allure was enhanced by comparison with the UK, where the group\u2019s properties include Birmingham\u2019s Bullring and Brent Cross in north-west London. The UK commercial property sector has been thrown into turmoil by the vote to leave the EU, with concerns about falling values of City office blocks and retail parks if the economy shrinks. David Atkins, Hammerson\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIreland stands out from other European territories for its powerful economic growth and dynamic consumer recovery. Furthermore, against the current backdrop of UK market volatility and political uncertainty, the Irish economy continues to hold a number of competitive advantages as a European hub for business activity in a wide range of sectors.\u201d Hammerson pointed to high rates of growth for Ireland, whose central bank expects the economy to expand by 5.1% this year and 4.2% in 2017. Many economists expect the UK to dip into recession in the second half of 2016 and the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates next week to shore up growth. To support its new acquisitions, Hammerson has opened an office in Dublin that will have about 130 employees. Before the deal, the company owned an interest in a small outlet centre in Kildare, west of Dublin. Hammerson said: \u201cThanks to its well-educated workforce, competitive tax regime, robust legal system, English-speaking business environment and ease of access to London and other major international cities, Ireland is expected to continue to hold its competitive advantage in attracting business activity.\u201d Dundrum Town Centre boats houses 120 shops, 38 restaurants and a 12-screen cinema. Tenants including Harvey Nichols, House of Fraser and Marks &amp; Spencer paid \u20ac30m (\u00a326m) in rent last year. In September, Hammerson and partner Allianz Real Estate \u2013 part of Germany\u2019s Allianz insurance group \u2013 bought loans secured against retail property from Ireland\u2019s National Asset Management Agency, which oversees troubled assets, for \u00a31.5bn. They have now taken control of Dundrum Town Centre and the other properties used to secure the loans. Hammerson\u2019s share of the purchase price was \u00a31.01bn. Hammerson and Allianz will own Dundrum jointly. Hammerson has bought the other properties, including three smaller Dublin shopping centres, from Allianz. Hammerson shares, which have fallen 15% since the vote to leave the EU, rose 1% to 498p.",
