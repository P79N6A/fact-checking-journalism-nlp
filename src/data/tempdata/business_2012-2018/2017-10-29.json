      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is poised to raise interest rates this Thursday for the first time in more than a decade, raising the cost of borrowing for British households already hurt by an earnings squeeze. Threadneedle Street is expected to reverse emergency action taken following the EU referendum, when it cut rates from 0.5% to 0.25% to avert a recession. While a slump has not materialised, the British economy appears in worse health than most other major countries with potential to be blown further off course by faltering talks to leave the EU. The UK is growing at half the rate recorded in the US for the year to September, at 1.5%, while growth is expected to trail Italy, France and Germany next year. Stepping up the cost of borrowing would add to household costs such as mortgage payments and taking out personal loans at a time when wage growth is failing to keep pace with inflation. The cut to real earnings means average pay is no higher than it was in February 2006, despite the economy being 4.4% bigger per person than at that time, according to the Resolution Foundation. Average earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.1% in the three months to August, down from 2.2% in the three months to July after a revision to the earlier data, according to the latest figures. That is despite the bargaining power of workers potentially being raised by the lowest level of unemployment since the mid-1970s. However, that is only a fraction below the expectations of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), which decides where to set the cost of borrowing. But it would need to be confident wages can rise further in the coming months. Although it will draw to a close the longest period in living memory without a rate rise \u2013 with the last in July 2007 when rates increased to 5.75% \u2013 economists expect this week\u2019s increase to be modest and followed by few, if any, further rises over the coming year. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has also cautioned that this is likely to be his preferred course of action. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cGiven that interest rates have not risen since 2007, the MPC may well sit tight for an extended period after an initial hike to see how consumers and businesses respond.\u201d While increasing borrowing costs could hurt squeezed households, it will support the strength of the pound and help to cut inflation, which reached 3% in September and is expected to rise further still, driven by the higher cost of importing food and fuel. Economists at HSBC expect two rate rises from the Bank, one on Thursday and one in May next year. They estimate this could reduce annual average inflation to 2.5% from a previous forecast of 2.9% The Bank\u2019s preparations come as business investment flatlines, with companies reluctant to spend because of fears over a hard Brexit. Similar to families facing a higher cost of living on the high street, companies have faced steeper prices for materials, eroding profitability. Raising interest rates would remove support for firms from cheap loans, potentially compounding the problem. Threadneedle Street had said in September that a majority of the MPC\u2019s nine members, including Carney, saw a need to raise rates should the economy continue to show signs of resilience. City analysts expect the MPC to split on Thursday, with votes against raising rates from two of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors, Dave Ramsden and Jon Cunliffe. Although the economy is growing slower than before the EU referendum, the Bank had been looking for a growth rate of 0.3% in the third quarter, which is below the rate recorded last week. City analysts viewed this as confirmation enough for an increase this week. Failure to act on Thursday could also pose fresh risks. Financial markets apportion a more than 80% chance of the MPC voting for a rise, which could mean keeping rates on hold triggers a drop in the value of the pound immediately after the decision. Philip Rush, the founder of the consultancy Heteronomics, said: \u201cA dovish disappointment would weaken the currency and reintroduce inflationary pressures that previously appeared to be intolerably excessive.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An Indian customs official has reportedly dismissed allegations that the Adani Group illegally siphoned nearly 15bn rupees (\u00a3176m) into overseas tax havens. It is the third set of siphoning allegations against the Adani Group and key figures in the Adani family to be dismissed by the official, KVS Singh, in recent months. The Indian mining conglomerate, which is preparing to build one of the world\u2019s largest coal mines in Australia, had been accused of using a front company in Dubai to inflate the price of equipment it purchased for electricity projects between 2009 and 2013. India\u2019s Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had alleged the Dubai company was sourcing equipment from South Korea and China, which it would sell on to Adani Group subsidiaries for up to 13 times the price in some instances. According to DRI documents published by the Guardian in August, the Dubai company was owned and controlled by Vinod Adani, the elder brother of Gautam Adani, who chairs the Adani Group. The Adani Group had consistently denied any wrongdoing. On Saturday the Indian Express reported that Singh, the adjudicating authority for the DRI, had decided to dismiss the allegations. He reportedly concluded that even though the Dubai company and the Adani Group were linked by the involvement of Vinod Adani, this had not affected the deal struck between the two. \u201cI have come to the conclusion that the said relation has not affected the price and that the same was at arm\u2019s length and have accepted the transaction value,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThus I find that the allegation that the impugned goods were over-valued does not hold water.\u201d Evidence collected by the DRI showed at least 57 cases of equipment being shipped directly to Adani Group subsidiaries in India while the invoices were routed through the Dubai company, which raised their price by an average of 400%. In his order, Singh reportedly concluded that under the relevant legislation, the \u201ccomparison of value of goods covered by each and every individual consignment was impermissible and unjustified in law\u201d. He reportedly found that the contract struck between two Adani Group subsidiaries, Maharashtra Eastern Grid Power Transmission Company Limited and PMC Projects, to source the equipment, had been issued \u201con the basis of international competitive bidding wherein the said bid was found to be the lowest\u201d. The Guardian has sought access to the order but the Adani Group declined to release it. The DRI did not respond to requests to access the judgment. The same customs official, Singh, dismissed two other sets of fraud allegations against Adani Group in August that allegedly employed the same modus operandi. As in the latest judgment, the August order concluded that though the Adani Group and the Dubai company were linked by the involvement of Vinod Adani, \u201cthe requirement of [the] relationship influencing the price was not satisfied\u201d. Singh also argued that the increased price the Dubai company charged the Adani Group subsidiaries could be justified on the grounds the company had provided extended warranties on the equipment it purchased, and had signed stringent supply contracts. \u201c[The Dubai company] had undertaken the risk and financial burden to provide extended warranty over what the [suppliers] had added substantially to the said goods,\u201d he said. \u201cThis additional risk spread over an extended period of time was bound to add a cost premium to the value of the imported goods.\u201d The DRI is reportedly preparing to appeal against Singh\u2019s August decision. Adani Group subsidiaries are among 40 companies facing separate allegations of using front organisations to increase the price of coal they mined from Indonesia. The total value of the alleged scam has been estimated at 290bn rupees. The Adani Group and the other companies fully deny the allegations. A public-interest lawsuit has been lodged in the Delhi high court asking for a special investigation into the fraud claims against the Adani Group and those involving other energy companies. The lawsuit, filed in September, alleges the Adani Group, the Indian company Essar, and several others inflated the price of power equipment and coal \u201cin order to cheat the people and to siphon off funds from public companies\u201d. Prashant Bhushan, the senior lawyer leading the case, said it would not be affected by Singh\u2019s latest order. The case will be heard again in the Delhi high court in November.",

    "webTitle": "Sparkling employment figures mask real picture of UK economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Falling unemployment has been the one bright spot in what has been a distinctly mediocre year for the economy. Harold Wilson was prime minister the last time Britain had a jobless rate as low as 4.3%. When the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee meets this week to discuss interest rates, the state of the labour market will feature prominently. Many of the members think that the UK is at, or very close to, full employment and that any further falls in joblessness will lead to wage inflation. We\u2019ve been here before. The Bank thought earnings growth would start to pick up when unemployment hit 7%, 6% and 5% and was wrong every time. Nor, to be frank, is there any evidence of an imminent wage-price spiral now. That\u2019s because the bulk of the jobs being created are low-skill, low-wage jobs in the service sector competed for by retirees coming back into the labour market to supplement their pensions, those arriving in the UK from overseas and former welfare claimants looking for work as a result of tougher benefit rules. The increase in the supply of labour is keeping pace with demand, keeping the lid on pay. The lack of any real upward pay pressure is one difference between today\u2019s labour market and that of the mid-1970s. Hidden unemployment is the other big change, as research from Sheffield Hallam University, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, shows. It concludes that the real level of unemployment is considerably higher than the officially reported rate. There are two ways in which the Office for National Statistics calculates unemployment. First, there is the claimant count, which picks up the number of people out of work and claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance or universal credit. In the spring of 2017, the claimant count stood at 785,000. The claimant count fell out of favour in the 1980s, however, when the then Conservative government made more than 30 changes to the way in which it was calculated, almost all of them leading to a lower total. Greater attention was paid to a broader measure of unemployment based on criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation. This second method states that a person is unemployed if he or she doesn\u2019t have a job, has looked for work in the past four weeks and can start within a fortnight. This methodology tops up the claimant count with another 735,000 people giving a total of just over 1.5m. The Sheffield Hallam researchers \u2013 Christina Beatty, Steve Fothergill and Tony Gore \u2013 say a further 760,000 should be added because they are people hidden on incapacity benefits. Real unemployment, the study says, is just shy of 2.3m. Parking people on incapacity benefits was a way of keeping the official unemployment total down in the 1980s and 1990s. Despite the population becoming gradually healthier, the number on incapacity benefits rose from 750,000 at the end of the 1970s to more than 2.5 million by the end of the 1990s. Vigorous efforts have subsequently brought the total down, but not by much. The researchers say many of those claiming incapacity benefits would like to work, but take a dim view of their job prospects because they feel their health is too poor or their disability is too severe, or because they think the chances of finding a job are small, especially when they are in competition with fit and healthy workers likely to catch the eye of potential employers. To be clear, the research does not say that these people are claiming incapacity benefits to which they are not entitled, but it notes that ill-health is not necessarily an insuperable barrier to holding down a job, and that the employment rate of those with a work-limiting disability depends on geography. According to official data, 44% of the 6.1 million people of working age classified as having a work-limiting disability are in employment, but the key factor is whether jobs are in short supply or hard to come by. In the north-east of England for example, the employment rate among men and women with a work-limiting disability was 37%, with similar rates for Scotland (38%), Wales (39%) and north-west England (40%). By contrast, it was 53% in the south-east and 52% in the south-west. The researchers calculate the level of hidden unemployment by benchmarking a town or region against what would be achievable were the local economy to be operating at full employment. As would only be expected, the highest rates of hidden unemployment are in the parts of the country where de-industrialisation has been most marked: South Wales, Merseyside, north-east England and Clydeside. In these areas, incapacity benefits can account for up to 10% of the entire working-age population. These are places where standards of health have long been below the national average, but a generation ago the incapacity claimant rates were far lower. The good news is that hidden unemployment is coming down, from just over a million in 2007 to 900,000 in 2012 and 760,000 now. That means the Sheffield Hallam estimate of real unemployment has also fallen by more than a million in the past five years. The bad news is that the total remains high and is concentrated in the regions with the weakest labour markets. Blackpool has the highest hidden unemployment on incapacity benefits, estimated at just over 7% of the town\u2019s working population. According to the claimant count, unemployment in Blackpool is 3,760. Adding in those classified as unemployed under the ILO definition, the total comes to 4,260. The study suggests a further 6,100 people are hidden unemployed, taking the total to 10,400, or 12% of the working population. Hartlepool, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and Middlesbrough fill the next four spots in the real unemployment list. Whatever the official figures might suggest, Britain is a long way from full employment. Some parts of the country are in the happy state of having enough jobs for all who want them, including those who feel marginalised, but almost all of them are in the home counties. Fothergill dismisses the idea that Britain was at or close to full employment, saying: \u201cWhat our estimates of the real level of unemployment show is that big variations in the health of regional and local economies are still very much with us.\u201d So if the Bank puts up interest rates this week, it won\u2019t be because the labour market is overheating in the Welsh valleys or former Pennine textile towns. It is now almost 40 years since the recession of the early 1980s decimated Britain\u2019s manufacturing base, and more than 30 years since the miners\u2019 strike heralded the end for coal. Those parts of the country have never recovered.",

Many of the members think that the UK is at, or very close to, full employment and that any further falls in joblessness will lead to wage inflation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/healthy-unemployment-figures-mask-hardship-fear-unregulated-jobs-market-irene\">Falling unemployment is great for the economy? Try telling cleaners like Irene | Stefan Baskerville</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve been here before. The Bank thought earnings growth would start to pick up when unemployment hit 7%, 6% and 5% and was wrong every time. Nor, to be frank, is there any evidence of an imminent wage-price spiral now.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the bulk of the jobs being created are low-skill, low-wage jobs in the service sector competed for by retirees coming back into the labour market to supplement their pensions, those arriving in the UK from overseas and former welfare claimants looking for work as a result of tougher benefit rules. The increase in the supply of labour is keeping pace with demand, keeping the lid on pay.</p> <p>The lack of any real upward pay pressure is one difference between today\u2019s labour market and that of the mid-1970s. Hidden unemployment is the other big change, as <a href=\"http://shura.shu.ac.uk/17175/\">research from Sheffield Hallam University</a>, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, shows. It concludes that the real level of unemployment is considerably higher than the officially reported rate.</p> <p>There are two ways in which the Office for National Statistics calculates unemployment. First, there is the claimant count, which picks up the number of people out of work and claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance or universal credit. In the spring of 2017, the claimant count stood at 785,000.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the Bank puts up interest rates this week, it won\u2019t be because the labour market is overheating in the Welsh valleys</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The claimant count fell out of favour in the 1980s, however, when the then Conservative government made more than 30 changes to the way in which it was calculated, almost all of them leading to a lower total. Greater attention was paid to a broader measure of unemployment based on criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation. This second method states that a person is unemployed if he or she doesn\u2019t have a job, has looked for work in the past four weeks and can start within a fortnight. This methodology tops up the claimant count with another 735,000 people giving a total of just over 1.5m.</p> <p>The Sheffield Hallam researchers \u2013 Christina Beatty, Steve Fothergill and Tony Gore \u2013 say a further 760,000 should be added because they are people hidden on incapacity benefits. Real unemployment, the study says, is just shy of 2.3m.</p> <p>Parking people on incapacity benefits was a way of keeping the official unemployment total down in the 1980s and 1990s. Despite the population becoming gradually healthier, the number on incapacity benefits rose from 750,000 at the end of the 1970s to more than 2.5 million by the end of the 1990s. Vigorous efforts have subsequently brought the total down, but not by much.</p> <p>The researchers say many of those claiming incapacity benefits would like to work, but take a dim view of their job prospects because they feel their health is too poor or their disability is too severe, or because they think the chances of finding a job are small, especially when they are in competition with fit and healthy workers likely to catch the eye of potential employers.</p> <p>To be clear, the research does not say that these people are claiming incapacity benefits to which they are not entitled, but it notes that ill-health is not necessarily an insuperable barrier to holding down a job, and that the employment rate of those with a work-limiting disability depends on geography.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc01d84ff243a59422c25f4be1eb5077b8c76c8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc01d84ff243a59422c25f4be1eb5077b8c76c8a/0_188_5644_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"grim-faced miners leaving colliery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kellingley colliery in Yorkshire, the last remaining deep coal mine in the country, which shut in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to official data, 44% of the 6.1 million people of working age classified as having a work-limiting disability are in employment, but the key factor is whether jobs are in short supply or hard to come by.<br></p> <p>In the north-east of England for example, the employment rate among men and women with a work-limiting disability was 37%, with similar rates for Scotland (38%), Wales (39%) and north-west England (40%). By contrast, it was 53% in the south-east and 52% in the south-west.</p> <p>The researchers calculate the level of hidden unemployment by benchmarking a town or region against what would be achievable were the local economy to be operating at full employment. As would only be expected, the highest rates of hidden unemployment are in the parts of the country where de-industrialisation has been most marked: South Wales, Merseyside, north-east England and Clydeside. In these areas, incapacity benefits can account for up to 10% of the entire working-age population. These are places where standards of health have long been below the national average, but a generation ago the incapacity claimant rates were far lower.</p> <p>The good news is that hidden unemployment is coming down, from just over a million in 2007 to 900,000 in 2012 and 760,000 now. That means the Sheffield Hallam estimate of real unemployment has also fallen by more than a million in the past five years.</p> <p>The bad news is that the total remains high and is concentrated in the regions with the weakest labour markets.

Bailey up for a grilling Andrew Bailey probably hasn\u2019t had the most relaxing weekend. If he\u2019s sensible, the Financial Conduct Authority chief executive will have been mugging up before questions at the Treasury committee on Tuesday. He could be in for a rough ride. Last Monday, the FCA reluctantly published a summary of a report into how Royal Bank of Scotland treated its small business customers. It was more critical of RBS than was suggested by a list of bullet points released by the FCA a year ago. The Treasury committee has hired a barrister to check for consistency between last week\u2019s summary and the full report. He handed over his findings last week. The FCA also revealed it was considering taking action against RBS. The MPs will want more detail, which Bailey may be unwilling to give. Then there is the matter of Saudi Aramco\u2019s mooted flotation in London. This month, Bailey admitted he met officials from Saudi\u2019s state oil company before publishing plans to soften listing rules to attract the giant \u00a31.5 trillion listing. Bailey would also be wise to bring figures about diversity in the upper ranks of the FCA. The MPs want fewer white men at the top of finance. Stop crude focus on oil profits At the start of last year, Britain\u2019s big oil companies, Shell and BP, appeared to be in crisis. A slump in the price of Brent crude \u2013 from more than $110 a barrel in 2014 to less than $30 in January 2016 \u2013 sent profits tumbling and appeared to threaten dividends. After painful cost cuts and a partial recovery in the oil price to near $60, the pressure has eased and both are expected to report solid first-half results this week. BP goes first, on Tuesday, with Shell, the stronger of the two, on Thursday. The commotion over the oil slump diverted some attention from their commitments to low-carbon energy. To much fanfare, both companies\u2019 boards supported resolutions at their 2015 annual meetings that required clearer reporting of emissions, business risks and efforts to develop green energy sources. But last week, ShareAction, which campaigned for the resolutions, criticised BP and Shell for inaction. Their capital spending on low-carbon energy sources (1.3% at BP and 3% by 2020 for Shell) was unconvincing, ShareAction argued. Cannily, the group couched its criticism in terms of the threat to pensions if BP and Shell find themselves extinct.

      "bodyText": "Economists tend to be sniffy about the CBI\u2019s distributive trades survey \u2013 the one that this week reported the \u201csteepest drop\u201d in retail sales since the depths of the recession in 2009. The report describes only a two-week snapshot of trading, they say, and thus is volatile and unreliable. The size of the sample is too small, they also argue, because only 49 retailers participate and half of them employ fewer than 100 people. These are fair points, and economists are paid to be fussy. But sometimes even a statistically dodgy survey chimes with common sense and the mood music from the front line. The overwhelming evidence suggests a storm is gathering over the retail sector. Exhibit A is John Lewis, almost the definition of a high street bellwether. Sales fell by 4.7% in the week before last. Warm autumn weather isn\u2019t helping, of course, because clothing rails are stocked with winter fashions, but this weak run is looking alarmingly long. Over three weeks, same-store sales at John Lewis are estimated to be 4.5% behind last year. And that\u2019s hefty. Then there is last week\u2019s profits warning from Pendragon, the car dealer behind the Evan Halshaw and Stratstone brands. Again, it may be that special factors are at work, in this case the slump in sales of diesel cars and overproduction by car manufacturers. But neither of those pressures is new. The bottom line is that, at the beginning of August, Pendragon expected to make a \u00a375m profit in 2017; now it thinks the figure will be \u00a360m. Perhaps nervous consumers are deciding this is not the moment to make a big-ticket commitment like a new car. That would fit with earnings data from the Office for National Statistics. Latest estimates show that, when inflation is taken into account, average real wages for employees fell by 0.4% in the period from June to August compared with the previous year. And the squeeze on incomes has probably intensified since then. Inflation, as measured by the retail prices index, rose to 3.9% in September. The strain is showing in consumers\u2019 wallets. UK Finance, a trade body for banks and credit card issuers, said borrowing on credit cards from high street banks was 5.5% higher than a year ago. Meanwhile, applications for individual voluntary arrangements \u2013 a means of managing personal debt \u2013 are soaring. The picture of maxed-out consumers struggling to save, and running on more credit, is clear. So is the influence of Brexit \u2013 or, more strictly, of a weaker pound \u2013 on disposable incomes. In the months immediately after the June 2016 referendum, nothing happened. Prices in shops didn\u2019t change and supermarkets could defer price rises on imported foods because they had locked in supplies at the old exchange rate. Now those financial hedges have finished and prices of basic goods in shops are rising. Another exchange rate effect may also be at work: retailers suspect consumers who took a summer holiday in the eurozone were surprised by the size of the credit card bill and have taken an autumn pledge of austerity. The question for retailers is whether Christmas will improve matters. Predictions of dire pre-Christmas trading have been confounded many times in recent years. The bleak October may turn out to be a blip, and the picture may be distorted by the shift to online shopping. The script could yet come good for shopkeepers, especially food retailers, if consumers decide a quick way to save is to avoid restaurants. Yet things feel different. Real incomes have fallen for the first time since 2014, confidence in house prices stands at a five-year low, and next week the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. Yes, the CBI survey, which showed a dramatic swing from boom to gloom between September and October, may be an exaggeration. But the direction of travel seems correct: 16 months after the fall in sterling, consumers feel poorer because they are poorer. Barclays stuck with Staley\u2019s strategy The first time Barclays wanted Jes Staley it got scared off. Appointing the American investment banker as chief executive in 2012 would have been too racy at a time when the bank was mired in the Libor rate-rigging scandal. Instead, the internal candidate Antony Jenkins got the job, until he was fired for being just a bit too safe. So, Barclays got Staley the second time around in 2015 \u2013 and he came with a big promise. John McFarlane, the loose-tongued chairman, let it be known that the ousting of Jenkins would give the bank a chance to double its share price in three years. That was July 2015 and the share price was 260p. If McFarlane does not rue the day he made that promise, Staley must. More than two years later, the shares are at 180p after taking a pounding following disappointing nine-month results last week. Staley cannot get momentum behind his vision for a transatlantic bank with centres in London and New York, and now freed from its once-prized African operations. True, he cannot be blamed for the Brexit-induced shock that rocked the markets last year. Yet that does not explain the malaise surrounding the bank. Anxiety looms large about Staley\u2019s strategy to expand the investment bank, which has been through numerous incarnations in recent years. The business is cyclical \u2013 and currently in the wrong part of the cycle to support his case to plough resources into an operation so hated by his predecessor. There is also uncertainty about Staley himself. Weighing heavily on the stock is an investigation by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic into his attempts to unmask a whistleblower weigh heavily on the stock. A damning finding could force Staley out \u2013 and leave Barclays looking for yet another chief executive. Yet here\u2019s the rub. A new boss is probably not what Barclays needs as it implements the Vickers reforms to ringfence its high street arm from its investment bank, or braces for Brexit. Staley\u2019s strategy may be unproven but it\u2019s the only one on the table. Dammit, Janet is set to survive President Donald Trump is expected to announce who will chair the US central bank for the next four years in the coming week. But after months of speculation involving various potential new appointees to run the Federal Reserve, analysts now expect he will give the incumbent, Janet Yellen, another term. No one should be surprised when a senior official who was once derided suddenly becomes the president\u2019s new best friend. It seems to happen to so many. In the summer, Trump said he was minded to replace Yellen, and put forward the names of five economists. Later he narrowed the field to two: Jerome Powell, a Fed official with a voting record that mimics Yellen\u2019s, and John Taylor, a Stanford University economist who ranks among the Fed\u2019s fiercest critics. One of Trump\u2019s concerns was that savers were being short-changed by low interest rates. But now that Yellen is raising rates, she is back in favour and he has moved on to other battles, giving monetary policy some much-needed stability.",

      "body": "<p>Economists tend to be sniffy about the CBI\u2019s distributive trades survey \u2013 the one that this week reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/alarm-sounds-over-state-of-uk-high-street-as-sales-crash\" title=\"\">the \u201csteepest drop\u201d in retail sales since the depths of the recession in 2009</a>. The report describes only a two-week snapshot of trading, they say, and thus is volatile and unreliable. The size of the sample is too small, they also argue, because only 49 retailers participate and half of them employ fewer than 100 people.</p> <p>These are fair points, and economists are paid to be fussy. But sometimes even a statistically dodgy survey chimes with common sense and the mood music from the front line. The overwhelming evidence suggests a storm is gathering over the retail sector.</p> <p>Exhibit A is John Lewis, almost the definition of a high street bellwether. Sales fell by 4.7% in the week before last. Warm autumn weather isn\u2019t helping, of course, because clothing rails are stocked with winter fashions, but this weak run is looking alarmingly long. Over three weeks, same-store sales at John Lewis are estimated to be 4.5% behind last year. And that\u2019s hefty.</p> <p>Then there is last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/23/shares-in-uks-biggest-car-dealer-pendragon-fall-by-17\" title=\"\">profits warning from Pendragon</a>, the car dealer behind the Evan Halshaw and Stratstone brands. Again, it may be that special factors are at work, in this case the slump in sales of diesel cars and overproduction by car manufacturers. But neither of those pressures is new. The bottom line is that, at the beginning of August, Pendragon expected to make a \u00a375m profit in 2017; now it thinks the figure will be \u00a360m. Perhaps nervous consumers are deciding this is not the moment to make a big-ticket commitment like a new car.</p> <p>That would fit with earnings data from the Office for National Statistics. Latest estimates show that, when inflation is taken into account, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/18/real-wages-fall-despite-low-levels-of-unemployment\" title=\"\">average real wages for employees fell by 0.4% in the period from June to August</a> compared with the previous year. And the squeeze on incomes has probably intensified since then. Inflation, as measured by the retail prices index, rose to 3.9% in September.</p> <p>The strain is showing in consumers\u2019 wallets. UK Finance, a trade body for banks and credit card issuers, <a href=\"https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/uk-finance-update-on-lending-october-2017/\" title=\"\">said borrowing on credit cards from high street banks was 5.5% higher than a year ago</a>. Meanwhile, applications for individual voluntary arrangements \u2013 a means of managing personal debt \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/27/rise-in-personal-debt-agreements-add-to-concerns-about-uk-debt\" title=\"\">are soaring</a>. The picture of maxed-out consumers struggling to save, and running on more credit, is clear.</p> <p>So is the influence of Brexit \u2013 or, more strictly, of a weaker pound \u2013 on disposable incomes. In the months immediately after the June 2016 referendum, nothing happened. Prices in shops didn\u2019t change and supermarkets could defer price rises on imported foods because they had locked in supplies at the old exchange rate. Now those financial hedges have finished and prices of basic goods in shops are rising. Another exchange rate effect may also be at work: retailers suspect consumers who took a summer holiday in the eurozone were surprised by the size of the credit card bill and have taken an autumn pledge of austerity.</p> <p>The question for retailers is whether Christmas will improve matters. Predictions of dire pre-Christmas trading have been confounded many times in recent years. The bleak October may turn out to be a blip, and the picture may be distorted by the shift to online shopping. The script could yet come good for shopkeepers, especially food retailers, if consumers decide a quick way to save is to avoid restaurants.</p> <p>Yet things feel different. Real incomes have fallen for the first time since 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/27/uk-housing-market-confidence-weakens-5-year-low-house-prices\" title=\"\">confidence in house prices stands at a five-year low</a>, and next week the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. Yes, the CBI survey, which showed a dramatic swing from boom to gloom between September and October, may be an exaggeration. But the direction of travel seems correct: 16 months after the fall in sterling, consumers feel poorer because they are poorer.</p> <h2>Barclays stuck with Staley\u2019s strategy</h2> <p>The first time Barclays wanted Jes Staley it got scared off. Appointing the American investment banker as chief executive in 2012 would have been too racy at a time when the bank was mired in the Libor rate-rigging scandal. Instead, the internal candidate Antony Jenkins got the job, until he was fired for being just a bit too safe. So, Barclays got Staley the second time around in 2015 \u2013 and he came with a big promise. John McFarlane, the loose-tongued chairman, let it be known that the ousting of Jenkins would give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/barclays-john-mcfarlane-board-double-share-price-three-years\" title=\"\">the bank a chance to double its share price in three years</a>.</p> <p>That was July 2015 and the share price was 260p. If McFarlane does not rue the day he made that promise, Staley must. More than two years later, the shares are at 180p after taking a pounding following disappointing nine-month results last week.</p> <p>Staley cannot get momentum behind his vision for a transatlantic bank with centres in London and New York, and now freed from its once-prized African operations. True, he cannot be blamed for the Brexit-induced shock that rocked the markets last year. Yet that does not explain the malaise surrounding the bank.</p> <p>Anxiety looms large about Staley\u2019s strategy to expand the investment bank, which has been through numerous incarnations in recent years.
