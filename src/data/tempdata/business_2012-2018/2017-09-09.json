      "bodyText": "A new study by the IMF examining the impacts of tax cuts has found that while lowering tax rates for the rich will stimulate the economy, it does so at the great cost of increased inequality. Most damningly, it finds the benefits of tax cuts targeted at the wealthiest 25% \u2013 such as the one the Turnbull government brought in last year \u2013 are far too weak to raise the welfare of the majority of the population and also never pay for themselves. Last year, the government made great talk of the need for a tax cut for those earning more than $80,000. The threshold for the 37% rate was raised to $87,000 to ensure \u2013 as the prime minister argued at the time that \u201cmiddle-income Australians, those that are on average full-time earnings, which as you know is nudging $80,000, don\u2019t move into the second top tax bracket\u201d. But as I noted at the time, those on $80,000 earned roughly 1.5 times the current median taxable income of $55,000, putting them above what would be considered \u201cmiddle class\u201d. Such income earners were also around the top 25% of those with a taxable income and in the top 14% of all adults. This year, the only income-tax cut delivered was similarly targeted at high-income earners \u2013 in this case the very high. The end of the deficit levy, which delivered a 2% tax cut to those earning more than $180,000, combined with the 0.5% increase in the Medicare levy, meant everyone who earned less than $240,000 had a tax rise, while those earning above that amount received a tax cut. And this is important because of the new IMF study \u2013 tax cuts aimed at the top 25% improve growth but reduce the welfare of most of the population, and tax cuts targeted at middle-income earners reduce inequality and can actually raise the size of the middle class. The study also rather sharply slaps down the biggest furphy put forward by many who advocate tax cuts to stimulate growth \u2013 that they will pay for themselves through stronger growth and, thus, more tax revenue. The idea of self-funding tax cuts got a big run in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan. He argued that his policies, which slashed the top tax rate in the US from 70% to 26%, would pay for themselves through increased growth. They didn\u2019t. In 2006, a US treasury study found that the tax cuts caused revenue to fall in real terms and was only partially made up by other tax increases that Reagan introduced. But the myth of tax cuts paying for themselves remains. The current US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said in April that economic growth would pay for Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts; in the same month Liberal senator James Paterson told the Senate that \u201cthe revenue collected from individuals after the tax rates were cut [by Reagan] in fact increased rather than decreased\u201d. The IMF study, which modelled the impacts of tax cuts on a US-style economy, found that any income-tax cut \u2013 whether targeted at middle or high-income households \u2013 reduced tax revenue. The study\u2019s authors noted that personal income-tax cuts stimulated growth but the supply-side effects, such as increased employment and wages, \u201care never large enough to offset the revenue loss from lower marginal tax rates\u201d. Or as they succinctly conclude: \u201ctax cuts do not pay for themselves\u201d. The study, however, finds that tax cuts do generate growth. This is not uncontroversial \u2013 giving people money either through direct or indirect payments or a tax cut will generally lead to them spending more money and thus increase economic growth. The issue is how to pay for the tax cuts and what impact they will have on the economy. The study looked at two types of tax cuts \u2013 one for middle-income earners and the other for those in the top 25% income bracket. It found that both improved economic growth, but more growth resulted from the high-income tax cuts. If you stopped reading there, you would miss the crucial aspect. While a high-income tax cut generates more growth than one directed at middle-income earners, that growth delivers very skewed benefits. The study found that in an economy such as the US or Australia, the high-income tax cut would lead to increased spending on goods and services, which in turn could improve wages for those lower-income earners who provided those goods, but it would also cause prices to rise and would need to be paid for by either other tax increases or cuts to government spending. The total impact, even when you accounted for policies that tried to \u201cprotect the poor\u201d to reduce the impact of other tax increases and spending cuts, was \u201ca significant decline in consumption of low and middle- income households, and a significant reduction of the middle class\u201d. So you get strong economic growth, but you reduce the size of the middle class and increase inequality. Damningly, the study\u2019s authors conclude of the high-income tax cut that \u201cthe \u2018trickle-down\u2019 effects\u201d are \u201cinsufficient to raise the welfare of the bulk of the population\u201d. On the other hand, they find that a tax cut targeted at middle-income earners, while generating less overall growth, \u201creduces income inequality and polarisation by moving people from lower income households back into the middle class\u201d. The study estimates that a tax cut targeted at middle-income earners can increase the size of the middle class by about 4% and reduce inequality, even if itis paid for by raising consumption taxes such as the GST. In the past, the belief has been that you need to sacrifice equality for economic growth. Numerous recent studies, however, have found that reducing inequality improves economic growth in the long term. The IMF study gives the issue an even more precise examination. Rather than talking in general economic terms, it looks at the specific impact of taxation policy. And it shows that governments that choose high-income tax cuts are choosing economic growth for the few and reduced welfare for the many.",

      "bodyText": "More than 2 million poor families will be more than \u00a350 a week worse off by the end of the decade, according to an alarming analysis of welfare cuts, crippling rent rises and looming inflation. In a bleak assessment of the plight of the poorest families in Britain, the study commissioned by the Local Government Association found that more than 84% of those set to lose \u00a350 a week or more are households with children, either lone parents or couples. Almost two-thirds of them are working households, despite claims from ministers that they wish to create a welfare system that encourages work. The analysis, by the Policy in Practice consultancy, also undermines claims from ministers that moves to cut taxes and increase the wages of the poorest are compensating them for years of austerity and the rising cost of living. While some of the seven million low-income households in Britain will be better off by 2020, the group as a whole faces an average loss of \u00a340.62 a week by 2020 compared with the end of last year, once benefit and tax changes, wages, housing costs and inflation are all taken into account. The report\u2019s publication comes as Philip Hammond, the chancellor, faces intense pressure to ease years of austerity following an election result that signalled voters had reached the end of their patience with spending cuts. Nurses took to the streets in protest last week over claims they have suffered a 14% real-terms cut in their wages over the past seven years. Hammond is also under pressure to curb rising levels of student debt in the forthcoming budget. The study finds that the introduction of the government\u2019s flagship policy of universal credit, which combines a series of benefits into a single payment, will lead to an average income loss of \u00a311.18 per week. It coincides with new warnings from Citizens Advice that the rollout of the system should be halted, amid claims that some of those already receiving it have found themselves in serious debt. With charities and councils warning of rising homelessness, increasing housing costs are identified as a main cause of falling income. More than 2 million low-paid private renters face an average real-terms loss of \u00a338.49 a week by 2020. For low-income private renters with three or more children, the average income loss that they face by 2020 in real terms is \u00a367.21 a week. This compares with \u00a330.67 for private renters without children. The authors also say rents are rising faster in some areas than others, with housing benefit not rising to match it. The study found rents are set to rise by 20.7% in the south-west by 2020, but by just 3.5% in the north-east. The report warns that there is now a looming \u201caffordability crisis\u201d because cuts to housing benefit, known as local housing allowance (LHA) for private renters, mean it is no longer linked to real rents, pushing people into poverty or even homelessness. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201cThis report reveals the true state of Britain, a country where millions of families face a daily struggle to afford a roof over their head and food on their table. This is the everyday experience of millions of people forced to the edge of homelessness. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on the government to act now, in this year\u2019s budget, to end the freeze on housing benefit and to commit to building decent homes at affordable rents. Without this action this is a crisis which can only get worse.\u201d The study points out that funding handed to councils and targeted at helping poor families had also been stripped back. Funding for extra help in the form of \u201cdiscretionary housing payments\u201d in 2017-18 is \u00a3185m, dwarfed by the combined annual income loss associated with the government\u2019s benefit cap, the bedroom tax and those paying rent above housing benefit levels, totalling more than \u00a34bn. Claire Kober, chair of the LGA\u2019s resources board, warned that the problems highlighted in the report came as councils were \u201cexperiencing huge funding pressures and faces an overall funding gap of \u00a35.8bn by 2020\u201d. \u201cCouncils are particularly concerned by the potential rise in the number of households in temporary accommodation or at risk of homelessness,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the right funding, freedom and flexibilities, councils could do so much more to manage and mitigate the impact of the welfare reforms, and help low-income households.\u201d The analysis also suggests the government\u2019s attempts to increase the minimum wage and lower income tax on poorer workers is not helping those in most need. It found 4.8 million low-income households would see no net benefit from the measures. Of the 2.4 million households that are better off due to the measures, 900,000 are households that are actually gaining from the transition to universal credit. Deven Ghelani, director of the Policy in Practice consultancy, said: \u201cThe broken link between LHA rates and rents means that housing is becoming increasingly unaffordable for people, particularly within the private rented sector.\u201d The Department for Work and Pensions said: \u201cThis report assumes that people won\u2019t make any attempt to change and to improve their lives. But our welfare reforms incentivise work and, for the first time, universal credit helps working people progress and earn more, so they can eventually stop claiming benefits altogether. \u201cUnder universal credit people are finding a job faster and staying in it longer than under the old system, and since the benefit cap was introduced, 34,000 households have moved off the cap and into work.\u201d",

More than 2 million low-paid private renters face an average real-terms loss of \u00a338.49 a week by 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"290ec52191ccb190a33b116f3b9ba8077728c6ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/290ec52191ccb190a33b116f3b9ba8077728c6ae/0_150_4512_2707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tories out demonstration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tories out national demonstration against Theresa May earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Chattle/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For low-income private renters with three or more children, the average income loss that they face by 2020 in real terms is \u00a367.21 a week. This compares with \u00a330.67 for private renters without children.</p> <p>The authors also say rents are rising faster in some areas than others, with housing benefit not rising to match it. The study found rents are set to rise by 20.7% in the south-west by 2020, but by just 3.5% in the north-east. The report warns that there is now a looming \u201caffordability crisis\u201d because cuts to housing benefit, known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/dec/07/rent-gap-local-housing-allowance\">local housing allowance </a>(LHA) for private renters, mean it is no longer linked to real rents, pushing people into poverty or even homelessness.</p> <p>Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201cThis report reveals the true state of Britain, a country where millions of families face a daily struggle to afford a roof over their head and food on their table. This is the everyday experience of millions of people forced to the edge of homelessness.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on the government to act now, in this year\u2019s budget, to end the freeze on housing benefit and to commit to building decent homes at affordable rents.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In the weeks that followed their disastrous election result, a delegation of Tory MPs marched to Downing Street with a clear message for the prime minister and her team. After years of austerity, voters\u2019 patience was running out, and some positivity was needed. The MPs went away from the meeting convinced they had secured an end to the public sector pay cap that would mark a loosening of spending cuts that they could use to show their constituents that the government was listening. Yet while Theresa May and her chancellor, Philip Hammond, are preparing to make a gesture to selected public servants, the years of salami slicing mean that, quite apart from Brexit, there are now myriad issues that ministers fear could erupt into full-blown political crises. It is why some Tories are now concerned that, far from staging a political recovery in the autumn, the party may do well to dodge a winter of discontent that would provoke renewed anger among voters and make the once-distant prospect of prime minister Jeremy Corbyn more likely. The spinning plates most in danger of crashing to the floor include not just public sector pay, but forthcoming welfare cuts, the increasingly controversial rollout of a new benefits system, local government funding and an NHS heading into an early winter crisis. \u201cThe next three to four months are possibly going to be the rockiest so far \u2013 with Brexit uncertainty affecting some of these domestic issues,\u201d said one minister. \u201cThese are choppy waters to navigate between now and New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cThe question is what concessions can be made in the budget consistent with our reputation for sound money and balancing the books. The threat of prime minister Corbyn is the only glue that is holding the Tory party together.\u201d The immediate threat is coming from the unions, some of whom are threatening strikes should the government attempt to reward some public sector workers rather than others. Major unions are already warning ministers not to be selective about which public servants deserve a raise. A survey by the public services union Unison of nearly 11,000 employees, including paramedics, teaching assistants, hospital porters and police staff, found that more than two in five (43%) described their standard of living as worse than a year ago, and a quarter (26%) said they owed more money than they did 12 months ago. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d said Dave Prentis, Unison\u2019s general secretary. \u201cThe pay cap must end, not this autumn or next year, but now. The government cannot pick and choose who should benefit. Everyone working in the NHS, schools and higher education, local government and the police service is long overdue a rise.\u201d Meanwhile, a coming welfare squeeze \u2013 combined with the new universal credit system of administering a series of benefits \u2013 is also threatening to unravel. Some Tories who rebelled over past attempts to cut tax credits still have concerns. \u201cThe problem with universal credit is the so-called taper rate [the amount of benefits a claimant loses for each pound they earn] \u2013 it is at 63p in the pound, meaning some are paying an effective 63% rate of tax on extra money they earn,\u201d said Stephen McPartland, one of the leading Tory campaigners on the issue. \u201cI would like to see the chancellor look at this again in the budget.\u201d There is an even more pressing issue emerging over the way universal credit is being administered. From October, the number of job centres introducing the new benefit is set to increase from five to 50 a month. However, highly respected Citizens Advice has taken the extreme move of calling for a pause of the rollout amid signs that delayed payments are pushing recipients into debt. In an analysis of more than 50,000 cases published last Monday, it found that claimants are 14% more likely to have problems with pressing debts if they are on universal credit compared with the benefits it is replacing. A fifth of recipients on universal credit are not being paid in full within six weeks. Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions select committee, said: \u201cThe idea of making people wait six weeks, and sometimes longer, for their benefit to be paid is made to look increasingly questionable by each bleak new piece of evidence on universal credit. People who are already hard up simply cannot cope that long without an income. \u201cI\u2019ve pleaded with the government for a Christmas truce \u2013 a postponement of the full rollout of universal credit in Birkenhead [the Labour MP\u2019s constituency] \u2013 otherwise the system will push families into destitution over the festive period.\u201d Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said universal credit remained \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d, adding: \u201cIf government doesn\u2019t fix these problems, its expansion is a disaster waiting to happen.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the organisation\u2019s analysis was not representative. \u201cThe vast majority of claimants are comfortable managing their money, and for anyone who needs extra help we have budgeting advice and benefit advances,\u201d she said. Also in the precarious policy mix is evidence that the NHS may face an early winter crisis. Last week, NHS Providers, which represents 229 of the 233 NHS trusts in England, said that the health service was on course for disaster unless an extra \u00a3350m was found for extra beds and staff. It all adds up to a very long queue outside the chancellor\u2019s door as he draws up one of the most challenging budgets in recent years. While the uncertainty over Brexit means he instinctively wants to take a conservative approach, political pressures to turn on the spending taps are growing. Ending austerity comes with a hefty price tag of \u00a333bn a year, according to the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies. It says that, among other things, allowing public sector pay to rise in line with pay in the private sector until 2020 would cost \u00a39.7bn by 2021-22. Unfreezing benefits would cost \u00a33.6bn, while reversing the cuts to work allowances in universal credit would cost about \u00a33.2bn. Allowing departmental spending to rise in line with economic growth would cost \u00a312.3bn. \u201cHammond has indicated that he has listened to the message in the election, but has also indicated he remains wedded to the idea of balancing the books by the middle of the next decade,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. \u201cAt the moment he is on course to slightly undershoot his public finance target for 2017-18. That could give him some wiggle room, but not much.\u201d Hammond is still said to be in cautious mode, but sympathetic to aiming any budget help at the young. Cancelling the forthcoming rise in student debt interest is one option. Some senior Tories see the mounting threats as part of a wider lack of vision from their party that needs to be addressed urgently. Grant Shapps, the former party chairman, said: \u201cWinning elections involves having both positive achievements and a positive message. It is vital that in this party conference and budget season we grasp the opportunity to show that there is no party in Britain more aspirational for the future of the British people than Conservatives.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "The $1tn question: how far can the new iPhone 8 take Apple?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Apple\u2019s stock market value is heading towards a new milestone and its latest product launch on 12 September could push the tech giant closer to becoming the first ever $1tn (\u00a3760bn) company. At the end of last week, the company\u2019s market capitalisation hovered around $830bn, continuing a 10-year run that has generally headed upwards since a low of $69bn in January 2009, during the financial crisis. Tuesday\u2019s event, with the iPhone 8 the star attraction, will strive to meet investors\u2019 \u2013 and customers\u2019 \u2013 vaulting expectations. But what will Apple tempt users with to justify Wall Street\u2019s faith in its future profits? An Apple spokesman declined to discuss what will be revealed at the event in the company\u2019s $5bn, spaceship-shaped Cupertino headquarters. However, although Apple is always tight-lipped, this year leaks from its suppliers, and from the company itself (through details embedded in a software update) have told us much about what\u2019s coming. iPhone The smartphone market is more competitive than ever, with sophisticated devices available for much less than the rumoured \u00a3900 cost of the iPhone 8. Most rivals are swallowing losses by cutting prices to win sales but Apple is heading upmarket to protect the iPhone, which is crucial to its success. Three new models are expected: two updating its present 7 and 7 Plus models (probably called the 7S and 7S Plus), and one entirely new \u2013 the iPhone 8. Internally known as \u201cD22\u201d, its screen will unlock via facial recognition, potentially replacing the fingerprint unlock system used since 2013. The screen will also cover more of the front, allowing the display to go right to the edges. And the screen will use a technology bought from Samsung \u2013 called Amoled, or active matrix organic light-emitting diode \u2013 which gives brighter colours. It could also mean the new phone will have a longer battery life because it does not need to be backlit, unlike the LCD screens Apple uses presently. But none of these technological tweaks are cheap \u2013 hence the \u00a3900 price tag, compared to the \u00a3719 starting price of the larger iPhone 7 Plus. The new phone will be a tricky sell, says Jan Dawson, who runs US-based tech consultancy Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt has to get the balance just right, giving people a compelling upgrade in the successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, while also offering up a higher tier,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt has to do that without alienating people who can\u2019t afford or justify spending the higher price for the new device, but don\u2019t want to settle for second best.\u201d The last time Apple had a \u201csecond best\u201d phone, the plastic iPhone 5C in 2013, its sales were slower than expected, while demand for the top-end 5S outstripped supply. Apple needs to avoid that happening again, says Dawson: \u201cIt has to supply the new premium phone in high enough numbers so that if there\u2019s a big demand shift from the standard models to the new one, it doesn\u2019t end up depressing overall sales while there are supply constraints.\u201d Apple seems confident. For the current quarter, it has forecast revenues of $49bn-$52bn, which would represent growth of between 4% and 11% from a year ago, and bring its performance back to 2015 levels. Dawson expects that iPhone sales will grow year-on-year in the October-December and January-March quarters: \u201cMuch of the timing of that growth will depend on the supply constraints.\u201d Wearables A few years ago, \u201cwearables\u201d \u2013 the market sector dominated by digital watches and Fitbits \u2013 were seen as the next technology hit. But the first Apple Watch, released in April 2015, underwhelmed many reviewers. None the less, early adopters liked it; the research company IDC reckons 28.8m had sold by the end of July this year. Though Apple doesn\u2019t release unit sales or revenues, it is definitely the world\u2019s most popular smartwatch, while Google\u2019s rival Android Wear business has failed to take off. Now Apple is readying a version that can use 4G phone networks. It means those who have bought an Apple Watch for fitness reasons \u2013 the watch\u2019s biggest customer base \u2013 can stream music or podcasts while they run and work out, as well as making FaceTime video or audio calls, getting map directions, and receiving and replying to messages. According to Bloomberg, the 4G version will be on sale at the four US mobile carriers, and possibly through European networks too. Apple\u2019s wearables strategy doesn\u2019t stop at the Watch: its wireless in-ear AirPods headphones, which have been in short supply since their launch last year, have delighted those who managed to get their hands on them. With supply improving, they could be a Christmas hit. Home With the smartphone market now well established, the home is the new battlefield for the big tech companies. A few years ago most people expected that Microsoft would be a serious contender because its Xbox console was installed in millions of living rooms. But instead Amazon has taken a lead, having sold an estimated 15 million of its voice-controlled Echo and Dot devices, which can provide weather, news and traffic reports and play music, as well as controlling digitally connected lights and similar devices around the home. Google joined in last year with its Google Home device. Now Apple is pitching in with HomePod, a high-quality music speaker controlled by its Siri voice assistant. As you might guess, it\u2019s pricey, with a reported cost of around \u00a3349 in the UK. Also expected is an update to Apple TV, the company\u2019s set-top box, to allow it to stream higher definition pictures. On its own, that might not sound much. But the company has big ambitions in the US market, where millions of homes are abandoning expensive monthly cable-TV contracts and opting for cheaper services such as Netflix. Apple always wants to get ahead of those broader digital trends. Now it aims to become an alternative TV service, offering a la carte programming if you buy its hardware. However, TV networks won\u2019t license their programmes cheaply because they want to retain the viewers who in turn watch the adverts that provide their revenues. So Apple is having to make its own. Eddy Cue, the executive behind this drive, is well-armed for the fight. As well as hiring TV and film executives, he has bought the rights to James Corden\u2019s Carpool Karaoke and has a $1bn warchest for producing original content. Although that\u2019s a long way from Netflix\u2019s $6bn annual spending, or Amazon\u2019s estimated $4.5bn, Apple is ambitious. Software A new iPhone means a new version of Apple\u2019s iOS software, which will update about 500m existing devices as well as running on the new products. With iOS 11, iPhone and iPads will be able to run \u201caugmented reality\u201d (AR) apps, which can overlay Star Wars spaceships, or map directions, or geolocated information, on to a live camera view on the screen. AR apps are forecast to spark a new app boom; some of them will struggle, but it only takes one success to validate the entire field. And Apple will have an advantage over Android, where AR will only work on a few million devices by the end of the year. Services For the past seven quarters, and 12 of the past 19, the fastest-growing part of Apple has been its \u201cservices\u201d. Most recently generating $7.2bn \u2013 more than either iPad or Mac sales \u2013 it includes Apple Music fees, the 30% cut of payments and subscriptions on millions of apps in the App Store, and payment for iCloud storage (where only the first 5GB is free). Chief executive Tim Cook has repeatedly pointed out to analysts that, on its own, the services segment generates enough revenue to enter the Fortune 100 list of America\u2019s biggest companies. As the iPhone user base grows, and people buy more apps, the services segment keeps growing. And if the Apple TV ploy succeeds, it could really take off. What Wall Street really likes about services, though, is its promise of recurring revenue, separate from hardware sales. If Apple grows its user base, the Services segment grows too; thus it also provides an indicator of the overall health of the company\u2019s ecosystem of hardware, software, users and developers. Suddenly, a $1tn valuation looks attainable \u2013 and sustainable. Surprises What else is Apple working on? The company\u2019s car project, code-named \u201cProject Titan\u201d, appears to have been scaled down and the firm will no longer build self-driving vehicles: according to reports, it will concentrate on the software behind autonomous cars instead. More likely to arrive sooner are \u201cAR glasses\u201d for putting augmented reality right in front of you. In March the Financial Times reported that Apple is working on such glasses; what\u2019s unclear, as ever, is the timescale. Months? Years? We can\u2019t be sure until Tim Cook shows it off on stage.",

      "body": "<p>Apple\u2019s stock market value is heading towards a new milestone and its latest product launch on 12 September could push the tech giant closer to becoming the first ever $1tn (\u00a3760bn) company.</p> <p>At the end of last week, the company\u2019s market capitalisation hovered around $830bn, continuing a 10-year run that has generally headed upwards since a low of $69bn in January 2009, during the financial crisis. Tuesday\u2019s event, with the iPhone 8 the star attraction, will strive to meet investors\u2019 \u2013 and customers\u2019 \u2013 vaulting expectations.</p> <p>But what will Apple tempt users with to justify Wall Street\u2019s faith in its future profits? An Apple spokesman declined to discuss what will be revealed at the event in the company\u2019s $5bn, spaceship-shaped Cupertino headquarters. However, although Apple is always tight-lipped, this year leaks from its suppliers, and from the company itself (through details embedded in a software update) have told us much about what\u2019s coming.</p> <h2><strong>iPhone</strong></h2> <p>The smartphone market is more competitive than ever, with sophisticated devices available for much less than the rumoured \u00a3900 cost of the iPhone&#xa0;8. Most rivals are swallowing losses by cutting prices to win sales but Apple is heading upmarket to protect the iPhone, which is crucial to its success.</p> <p>Three new models are expected: two updating its present 7 and 7 Plus models (probably called the 7S and 7S Plus), and one entirely new \u2013 the iPhone 8. Internally known as \u201cD22\u201d, its screen will unlock via facial recognition, potentially replacing the fingerprint unlock system used since 2013. The screen will also cover more of the front, allowing the display to go right to the edges. And the screen will use a technology bought from Samsung \u2013 called Amoled, or active matrix organic light-emitting diode \u2013 which gives brighter colours. It could also mean the new phone will have a longer battery life because it does not need to be backlit, unlike the LCD screens Apple uses presently.</p> <p>But none of these technological tweaks are cheap \u2013 hence the \u00a3900 price tag, compared to the \u00a3719 starting price of the larger iPhone 7 Plus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/apple-share-price-zip/giv-3902TWTsRbSqqop5\" data-alt=\"Apple's share price\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/apple-share-price-zip/giv-3902TWTsRbSqqop5\">Apple's share price</a> </figure>  <p>The new phone will be a tricky sell, says Jan Dawson, who runs US-based tech consultancy Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt has to get the balance just right, giving people a compelling upgrade in the successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, while also offering up a higher tier,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt has to do that without alienating people who can\u2019t afford or justify spending the higher price for the new device, but don\u2019t want to settle for second best.\u201d</p> <p>The last time Apple had a \u201csecond best\u201d phone, the plastic iPhone 5C in 2013, its sales were slower than expected, while demand for the top-end 5S outstripped supply.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s that time of year when thousands of fashion buyers, press and \u201cdigital influencers\u201d decamp to London to take in the catwalk shows that will shape what we wear come spring. On Wednesday, the Polish brand Reserved put on a show of its own, hiring Kate Moss to draw the fashion crowd to its debut store on London\u2019s Oxford Street, where 120 million shoppers pass by each year. Billed as Poland\u2019s answer to Topshop, the retailer is ploughing an initial \u00a350m into breaking the UK market, paying a high price for the cavernous former BHS department store it believes will, literally, provide it with a shop window to the world. \u201cLondon is a bridge to a new world of very competitive fashion for us,\u201d says Marek Piechocki, who co-founded the fashion brand in the days after communist rule ended in Poland in 1989. \u201cIt is a mirror for the whole world and will prove whether we can stand strong alongside our biggest competitors.\u201d But gaining a foothold in the UK high street is not without risk. High shop rents and intense competition make the big prize of the \u00a336bn that Britons spend each year on clothing elusive. After trumpeting their arrival three years ago the US chain American Eagle threw in the towel this summer. Gap-owned Banana Republic quit the UK last year. Another US brand Forever 21 has also been closing stores after setting up shop in 2010. The big successes of recent years have been online specialists, such as Boohoo and Asos, which are going from strength to strength. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d sighs Piechocki, reacting to the list of failures. \u201cBut when you look at these American companies they are offering a classic look with a college style that is more or less repeating forever. The European customer is completely different. I believe we are one of the European leaders in fashion forward clothing.\u201d Reserved has signed a 10-year lease worth \u00a342m to secure its prized spot on London\u2019s most important shopping street. If the retailer is Poland\u2019s Topshop, then Piechocki must be its de facto Philip Green, albeit a tall, slim, uncontroversial version with a degree in civil engineering from the Gda\u0144sk University of Technology. The 56 year-old started LPP with another entrepreneur Jerzy Lubianiec when he was in his late twenties. The businessmen initially ran an import business, selling clothes to the hypermarket chains that had begun to colonise Poland\u2019s virgin grocery market. \u201cDuring communist times we were having coupons for everything,\u201d Piechocki explains. \u201cThere was nothing in the shops. There was big demand for everything, particularly garments. \u201cIn 1989 when we got a container load of 20,000 shirts, customers would be queuing up and paying cash,\u201d he says. \u201cThen we were having a whole table of cash and the next day we could go and buy more.\u201d Around half of parent company LPP\u2019s 6bn zloty (\u00a31.3bn) annual sales hail from Reserved stores with the rest rung up by its four other brands: Mohito, House, Cropp and Sinsay. Reserved\u2019s pitch is to 20- to 40-year-old British shoppers with \u201caccessible and affordable on-trend pieces\u201d such as the \u00a340 faux leather jackets and \u00a320 skinny jeans among its autumn ranges. Piechocki describes its women\u2019s fashion \u2013 its also offers men\u2019s and childrenswear \u2013 as \u201cmore feminine\u201d than the likes of H&amp;M with an \u201ceastern European twist\u201d on current trends. Its in-house designers use graphics inspired by Poland\u2019s famous heritage in poster art to give the brand a point of difference. Against all odds \u2026 It is easy to forget that international retailers such as Sweden\u2019s H&amp;M and Spanish export Zara, which are now a ubiquitous presence on the British high street, also got lost in translation when they opened their first stores. \u201cThe Zara sizing was quite wrong \u2013 because we are much bigger than the Spanish or the French,\u201d says Maureen Hinton, a retail analyst at consultancy GlobalData. \u201cBut because the company takes a lot of feedback from its store managers it was able to adapt. \u201cAmerican Eagle and Forever 21 were not different enough to what is already here. Zara and H&amp;M are much stronger brands ... there\u2019s a lot of competition and you\u2019ve got to stand out from the crowd.\u201d After touring the Reserved store, another GlobalData analyst reported back that it was a \u201cbit hit and miss\u201d in style terms, with strong casualwear and workwear ranges undermined by what she viewed as the damning presence of \u201csnoods and waterfall cardigans\u201d. H&amp;M opened its first store in 1976 and now has 280 stores including new brands Arket and Weekday, which opened their first stores in London last month. Inditex-owned Zara now has 110 stores including sister brands Massimo Dutti and Pull &amp; Bear. \u201cZara doesn\u2019t advertise so when the store opened on Regent Street nobody knew the brand and it struggled to recruit staff,\u201d explains one fashion insider. \u201cShoppers didn\u2019t understand what it was offering because the stores looked upmarket, which frightened people off. When the next stores opened in Bluewater and Reading the sales figures were shocking. \u201cI think Reserved will succeed or fail based on quality and price points of product,\u201d the experienced fashion executive added. \u201cI have experience of fashion retailing in eastern Europe and to my mind it\u2019s a very specific taste that doesn\u2019t necessarily work in the UK.\u201d Reserved has created the 150-piece Redesign specifically tailored to UK shoppers and the Oxford Street store will be receiving new drops of clothing twice a week. Bestsellers can be repeated in its Polish factories within three weeks. Today LPP is one of Poland\u2019s biggest listed companies with 1,700 shops covering swaths of eastern Europe. Once the retailer has honed its UK formula, Piechocki says more stores will follow \u2013 he is still a firm believer in the power of bricks and mortar, even in a digital age. Despite the odds seemingly stacked against Reserved, Piechocki is quietly determined to conquer the British high street. \u201cWe have never withdrawn from any market in 25 years,\u201d he says, before citing the phrase \u201cnever, never, never give up\u201d, borrowed from Churchill. \u201cThis is such a crucial step for the company because if we can succeed in London there is no other city in the world where we cannot be successful.\u201d",

High shop rents and intense competition make the <a href=\"tel:www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/another-high-street-name-could-join-bhs-scrapheap-kantar-sales-decline-uk-fashion\">big prize of the \u00a336bn</a> that Britons spend each year on clothing elusive. After trumpeting their arrival three years ago the US chain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/26/normcore-goes-mainstream-american-eagle-shops-uk-london\">American Eagle</a> threw in the towel this summer. Gap-owned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/18/gap-to-shut-all-banana-republic-shops-in-the-uk\">Banana Republic</a> quit the UK last year. Another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/01/forever-21-us-answer-to-topshop\">US brand Forever 21</a> has also been closing stores after setting up shop in 2010.</p> <p>The big successes of recent years have been online specialists, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/26/boohoo-profits-nearly-double-celebrities-instagram-online-fashion-retail\">Boohoo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/15/asos-app-allows-shoppers-to-snap-up-fashion\">Asos</a>, which are going from strength to strength.</p> <p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d sighs Piechocki, reacting to the list of failures. \u201cBut when you look at these American companies they are offering a classic look with a college style that is more or less repeating forever. The European customer is completely different. I believe we are one of the European leaders in fashion forward clothing.\u201d</p> <p>Reserved has signed a 10-year lease worth \u00a342m to secure its prized spot on London\u2019s most important shopping street. If the retailer is Poland\u2019s Topshop, then Piechocki must be its de facto Philip Green, albeit a tall, slim, uncontroversial version with a degree in civil engineering from the Gda\u0144sk University of Technology.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc646ecf0f6cd4ba9d3dd9f3da01193bf4bc684d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc646ecf0f6cd4ba9d3dd9f3da01193bf4bc684d/0_202_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers pass the Reserved store on Oxford Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers pass the Reserved store on Oxford Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Chattle/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 56 year-old <a href=\"http://www.lppsa.com/o-nas/historia-lpp?lang=en\">started LPP with another entrepreneur Jerzy Lubianiec</a> when he was in his late twenties. The businessmen initially ran an import business, selling clothes to the hypermarket chains that had begun to colonise Poland\u2019s virgin grocery market. </p> <p>\u201cDuring communist times we were having coupons for everything,\u201d Piechocki explains. \u201cThere was nothing in the shops. There was big demand for everything, particularly garments.</p> <p>\u201cIn 1989 when we got a container load of 20,000 shirts, customers would be queuing up and paying cash,\u201d he says. \u201cThen we were having a whole table of cash and the next day we could go and buy more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c53fc2d4ea8e61b3f28f301ae90c60407f5459e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c53fc2d4ea8e61b3f28f301ae90c60407f5459e/0_175_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Moss\u2019s clothing range for Reserved.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Moss\u2019s clothing range for Reserved.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DALiM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around half of parent company LPP\u2019s 6bn zloty (\u00a31.3bn) annual sales hail from Reserved stores with the rest rung up by its four other brands: Mohito, House, Cropp and Sinsay.

You may have seen an advert somewhere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Against all odds \u2026</h2> <p>It is easy to forget that international retailers such as Sweden\u2019s H&amp;M and Spanish export Zara, which are now a ubiquitous presence on the British high street, also got lost in translation when they opened their first stores.</p> <p>\u201cThe Zara sizing was quite wrong \u2013 because we are much bigger than the Spanish or the French,\u201d says Maureen Hinton, a retail analyst at consultancy GlobalData. \u201cBut because the company takes a lot of feedback from its store managers it was able to adapt.</p> <p>\u201cAmerican Eagle and Forever 21 were not different enough to what is already here. Zara and H&amp;M are much stronger brands ... there\u2019s a lot of competition and you\u2019ve got to stand out from the crowd.\u201d</p> <p>After touring the Reserved store, another GlobalData analyst reported back that it was a \u201cbit hit and miss\u201d in style terms, with strong casualwear and workwear ranges undermined by what she viewed as the damning presence of \u201csnoods and waterfall cardigans\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af795f19c85fae49d8c9ced2465f5cbf5aa57f57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af795f19c85fae49d8c9ced2465f5cbf5aa57f57/82_117_3272_1964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Moss arrives at the Reserved store opening on Oxford Street, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Moss arrives at the Reserved store opening on Oxford Street, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>H&amp;M opened its first store in 1976 and now has 280 stores including new brands <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/aug/19/swedish-stores-uk-high-street-invasion-market-weekend\">Arket and Weekday</a>, which opened their first stores in London last month. Inditex-owned Zara now has 110 stores including sister brands Massimo Dutti and Pull &amp; Bear.</p> <p>\u201cZara doesn\u2019t advertise so when the store opened on Regent Street nobody knew the brand and it struggled to recruit staff,\u201d explains one fashion insider. \u201cShoppers didn\u2019t understand what it was offering because the stores looked upmarket, which frightened people off. When the next stores opened in Bluewater and Reading the sales figures were shocking.</p> <p>\u201cI think Reserved will succeed or fail based on quality and price points of product,\u201d the experienced fashion executive added. \u201cI have experience of fashion retailing in eastern Europe and to my mind it\u2019s a very specific taste that doesn\u2019t necessarily work in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Reserved has created the 150-piece Redesign specifically tailored to UK shoppers and the Oxford Street store will be receiving new drops of clothing twice a week. Bestsellers can be repeated in its Polish factories within three weeks.</p> <p>Today LPP is one of Poland\u2019s biggest listed companies with 1,700 shops covering swaths of eastern Europe. Once the retailer has honed its UK formula, Piechocki says more stores will follow \u2013 he is still a firm believer in the power of bricks and mortar, even in a digital age.</p> <p>Despite the odds seemingly stacked against Reserved, Piechocki is quietly determined to conquer the British high street. \u201cWe have never withdrawn from any market in 25 years,\u201d he says, before citing the phrase \u201cnever, never, never give up\u201d, borrowed from Churchill. </p> <p>\u201cThis is such a crucial step for the company because if we can succeed in London there is no other city in the world where we cannot be successful.\u201d</p>",
