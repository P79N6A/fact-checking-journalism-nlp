      "bodyText": "Three of the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chains have halted deliveries of chicken from a factory belonging to the country\u2019s biggest poultry supplier after undercover filming revealed poor hygiene standards and food safety records being altered. The 2 Sisters Food Group, which owns the site, is also facing a \u201cshort, sharp\u201d parliamentary inquiry in the wake of evidence uncovered by a joint investigation by the Guardian and ITV News, which showed footage of workers altering the source and slaughter date of poultry being processed at the plant in West Bromwich. Experts said their actions could artificially stretch the commercial life of the meat and dupe consumers into buying chicken past its use-by date. Other footage showed chicken being picked off the floor and being thrown back on to the production line, and older poultry being mixed with fresher birds. The chairman of parliament\u2019s environment, food and rural affairs committee, Neil Parish, said he was preparing to call the founder of 2 Sisters, Ranjit Singh Boparan, to Westminster to answer questions about the scandal. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) launched its own investigation into the company, which produces a third of all poultry products eaten in the UK. Marks &amp; Spencer said the footage showed \u201cunacceptable\u201d standards. All chicken received from the plant had been cleared from its shelves as a precautionary measure and all further deliveries had been stopped until M&amp;S completed its own investigation of conditions in the chicken factory. Marks &amp; Spencer said: \u201cWe have commenced an immediate investigation into these allegations and will not be taking any more product from the West Bromwich site until it has concluded to our satisfaction. \u201cThe standards shown in the footage are unacceptable, we take hygiene and traceability very seriously and have extremely high production standards.\u201d Aldi and Lidl said they had also suspended supplies from the food processor, while Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s had launched their own investigations. Parish said: \u201cIt would be good if we could have a short, sharp inquiry. We need to restore both food safety, animal welfare and consumer confidence to these massive chicken plants run by 2 Sisters. \u201cWe would certainly head for the highest levels of the company and ask them to present evidence to us. We are producing chicken to a very high standard in this country. We have got to make sure that welfare and food safety through the processing plants are carried out properly. In this case, it is not and it has to be put right immediately.\u201d The prospect of the publicity-shy Boparan being called in front of parliamentarians emerged as the FSA said it had begun \u201cliaising with the local authority in regards to taking the investigation forward and will consider whether offences have been committed\u201d. The joint investigation involved taking secret recordings during a spell of 12 working days inside 2 Sisters\u2019 plant in West Bromwich. It revealed evidence of: \u2022 An instance of workers altering the \u201ckill date\u201d of hundreds of chickens to one day later in August. Simultaneously, workers changed records of where chickens had been slaughtered, potentially hindering authorities from recalling contaminated meat during food scares. \u2022 Chicken portions which had been returned by supermarket distribution centres being repackaged by 2 Sisters and sent out again to rival grocers. \u2022 Workers dropping chicken on the floor of the processing plant and returning it to the production line. \u2022 Chickens slaughtered on different dates being mixed on the production line. Workers said use-by dates printed on the packets of the mixed chicken tended to reflect the age of the freshest, rather than oldest, meat in the batch. A spokesman for 2SFG said: \u201cWe have now had an opportunity to view all the evidence and launch our own internal investigation. This is ongoing and we will ensure our inquiries are comprehensive and thorough. We will of course continue to work closely with all stakeholders during this investigative phase.\u201d The FSA said inspectors visited the West Bromwich plant on Thursday and found no evidence of breaches. \u201cHowever we continue to review the evidence and if any incidences of non-compliance are found we will take prompt and proportionate action with the business concerned, working closely with the local authority. \u201cWe would urge ITV and the Guardian to share any additional evidence, including witness statements, that would inform our investigation.\u201d It said the plant was regularly audited by the FSA and subjected to unannounced inspections. It urged anyone with information in relation to the investigation to get in contact. 2 Sisters Food Group is the UK\u2019s second largest food company by turnover and claims to process around 6 million chickens a week. It is owned by Boparan and his wife, Baljinder Kaur Boparan, and the chicken operations \u2013 which include 12 sites in the UK \u2013 are part of a sprawling \u00a33bn food empire that separately includes the turkey producer Bernard Matthews, the restaurant chains Harry Ramsden, FishWorks and Giraffe, plus food brands such as Fox\u2019s Biscuits and Goodfella\u2019s pizza. The Boparans, who have always shunned publicity, are worth \u00a3544m, according to the Sunday Times rich list. The company said: \u201c2SFG ensures all staff are fully trained on hygiene and safety matters, and enforces a number of policies to ensure compliance with all regulations. It is subject to regular audits in these areas and staff have a number of ways in which to voice their concerns.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Shares in the beleaguered Carillion construction group, which is working on the HS2 London to Birmingham rail line and the vast Battersea Power Station project, plunged by 20% on Friday after the company issued its second profit warning in two months. Carillion reported a first-half loss of \u00a31.15bn and said its full-year performance would be worse than previously expected. It described the loss as \u201cdisappointing\u201d. The shares, which were changing hands at 190p little more than three months ago, closed at 51p. The company is struggling with a large debt pile and badly-performing contracts. It said it would write down \u00a3200m on 23 support services contracts, and was taking a \u00a3134m charge relating to its UK and Canadian construction businesses. In July, the company shocked the City with a profit warning, an \u00a3845m writedown, and the departure of its chief executive. \u201cThis is a disappointing set of results,\u201d said Keith Cochrane, who was appointed interim chief executive after his predecessor Richard Howson resigned when the group\u2019s financial problems emerged in July. \u201c[It] reflects the issues we flagged in July and the additional \u00a3200m provision for our support services business that we have announced today. We now expect results for the full year to be lower than current market expectations.\u201d The company counts the government among its biggest customers and has won a series of high-profile contracts, including on the HS2 project. It is also working on the Anfield stadium in Liverpool. Cochrane said the group had been working on \u201ca clear plan\u201d since July to address its problems, with the aim of reducing Carillion\u2019s risks and costs, and strengthening its balance sheet. Net debt has almost doubled to \u00a3571m in the last year. \u201cNo one is in any doubt of the challenge that lies ahead. We have made an encouraging start and the ambition is there to build on that progress,\u201d Cochrane said. \u201cAt the heart of this company, there is a strong core. Supported by an operating model that manages risk much more effectively and led by a fresh management team with a mandate to drive cultural change, I am confident that a strong business can emerge.\u201d However, Julie Palmer, partner at the insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor, said Carillion\u2019s first-half results made \u201cuncomfortable\u201d reading. \u201cAs one of the government\u2019s biggest contractors, with more than 50,000 staff worldwide and an eye-watering pension deficit, many believe that Carillion is now too big to fail. With no permanent chief executive in place, an unstable shareholder register and a current market value of less than \u00a3200m, calling on investors to shore up its finances is no longer a possibility,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile the current management team is working hard to create a more stable and cash positive base going forward, by selling off non-core businesses including its healthcare operations in the UK and Canada, the most realistic short term fix is a cheap sale to a white knight, which, if you believe the hype, could be just around the corner.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Philip Larkin famously said life was never better than in 1963, between the end of the ban on Lady Chatterley and the first Beatles LP. The former poet laureate was wrong. As far as younger people were concerned, it was just the start of a spending boom that went on for the rest of the century. Then things flipped around. After decades in which young people had consumed more on average than the population as a whole, since the turn of the millennium it has been the older generation who have had the spare cash to flash around. The conventional wisdom is that young people are having a tough time of things, which is why they voted overwhelmingly for Jeremy Corbyn in the general election. This view of the world has not gone unchallenged. The millennials might not be seeing the same sort of growth in real incomes as their parents and grandparents did, but they are still having a grand old time, streaming their music on Spotify, jetting off for weekend breaks in Budapest and eating avocado on toast before heading off to the movies. A study of consumption data stretching back to 1963, carried out by experts at Loughborough University for the Resolution Foundation, puts this theory to the test and finds it wanting. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the young are spendthrifts frittering away their money. The real story is that the baby boomer generation have been on the winning side both when they were young and now that they are getting older. Young people are, by contrast, being squeezed in two ways \u2013 their incomes are not rising nearly as rapidly as was the case in the past, and more of that income is being spent on housing. In 1963, those aged between 25 and 34 spent marginally less than 55- to 64-year-olds, but that picture changed markedly: by 1989 those aged 25-34 were spending 11% more. By 2014, they were spending 15% less. As far as individual categories of spending are concerned, the report finds that those aged 25-34 do eat out more than those aged 55-64, but that is mainly accounted for by the fact that younger people spend less on eating in. Since 2000, the upward trend in eating out has been driven by older working-age adults. There is, says the report, little support for the idea that \u201cavocado on toast consumption in cafes is crowding out more long-term or purposeful spending\u201d among younger people. Similarly, consumption of holidays by younger people has remained flat since 2000, with the strongest growth recorded by the 55-64 demographic, who enjoy more leisure trips than any other age group. The narrative that millennials are jet-setting more than their predecessors is not supported by the facts. Nor have the older generations missed out on the consumer products made available by technological developments. Younger people spend \u00a39 a week on their mobiles and internet services, compared with \u00a37 a week for those aged 55-64, and the increase in spending since 2000 has been similar at all ages. The report the 10th done for the Resolution Foundation\u2019s intergenerational commission and contains both an economic and a political message. The economic message is that young people \u2013 especially those on low incomes \u2013 are struggling. They are cutting back and often living in grotty housing conditions. The political message is that the different consumption patterns explain why the Conservatives only secured a majority in the election among those in their mid-40s and older.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK economy grew at a slower pace than previously thought in July, with fresh warning signals pointing to weaker growth as the Bank of England prepares to raise the cost of borrowing for the first time in a decade. Britain recorded its weakest annual growth rate since 2013 in the three months to the end of June, according to revised figures published on Friday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The country\u2019s services sector showed signs of contracting, while the UK\u2019s trading position with the rest of the world also deteriorated. The figures come as new Bank of England data showed consumers continuing to borrow using personal loans, credit cards and car finance at a rate almost five times that of the growth in earnings. Consumer credit increased by 9.8% in the year to August and now stands at \u00a3203bn \u2013 a level unseen since the financial crisis. The ONS found that the amount being set aside as savings rose to 5.4% of disposable income in the three months to June \u2013 although this remains well below the near-10% average for the last 50 years. The figure for the three months to March was revised up to 3.8% from 1.7%. Debt charities are becoming increasingly alarmed, seeing more people turning to them for help. \u201cMillions of people\u2019s household finances are on a knife edge, with nearly 9 million people in the UK having had to rely on credit to cover essential household bills in the last year,\u201d said Peter Tutton at the StepChange debt charity. Threadneedle Street could use a rate increase from 0.25% to 0.5% \u2013 signalled for as early as November \u2013 to prick the growth in debt levels. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, warned on Friday of a \u201cpocket of consumer debt\u201d he wants to target. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the governor said consumer lending is \u201cgetting a little frothy and should be addressed\u201d. He also took a more upbeat view on the economy, with the unemployment rate at a 42-year low and robust retail sales figures among the factors swaying the Bank\u2019s outlook. Carney said the Bank was ready to raise the cost of borrowing should the economy continue to show signs of strengthening. \u201cAll the indications are that it is \u2013 in the relatively near term you can expect that interest rates will increase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are talking about just easing a bit off the accelerator to keep with the speed limit of the economy. So interest rate increases when they come \u2013 when and if they come \u2013 will be to a limited extent and in a gradual way.\u201d However, official data published soon after Carney spoke showed year-on-year GDP growth slowed to 1.5% in the second quarter from 1.8% in the first three months of the year, against an expectation among City economists that there would be no change. The quarterly growth rate for the three months to June stood unchanged at 0.3%. Figures for the UK\u2019s trading position, also published on Friday, showed the current account deficit \u2013 a measure of Britain\u2019s trade and investment income with the rest of the world \u2013 unexpectedly widened by \u00a3900m in the three months to June, to \u00a323.2bn. As a share of GDP, the deficit widened to 4.6% in the second quarter from 4.4% in the first three months of the year. While less than the 6.5% recorded just before the Brexit referendum, the figure is still much greater than the 60-year average of 1.3%. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe risk of a hard Brexit still threatens to sap overseas\u2019 investors enthusiasm for UK assets. Higher interest rates likely will boost sterling, exacerbating the current account deficit and increasing financial stability risks.\u201d Meanwhile, July figures for the country\u2019s services sector, which makes up about 80% of the economy, showed a 0.2% decline on the previous month. Darren Morgan of the ONS said: \u201cThere was a notable slowdown in growth in the first half of 2017. The often buoyant services sector was the only area to grow in the second quarter.\u201d The figures will be disappointing for Philip Hammond, as the chancellor prepares to deliver his autumn budget in November. The data will limit his wriggle room and also come at a time when the risks to the economy increase as the UK prepares to leave the EU. Carney has repeatedly warned that the UK relies on the \u201ckindness of strangers\u201d through its current account deficit \u2013 referring to the need for foreign investors to buy UK sovereign debt in order to plug the deficit \u2013 at a time when the risks to trade and investment facing the country are increasing. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cIt would be unprecedented for the central bank to tighten policy with the data pointing to such anaemic economic growth. However, policymakers continue to fuel expectations that interest rates will rise soon in response to higher-than-expected inflation.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Ryanair promises full refunds or rebooking for cancelled flights", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair has promised to notify all customers of their rights to compensation, including rebooking on other airlines, as it attempted to avert legal action by the UK aviation watchdog. The Civil Aviation Authority had ordered the airline to tell hundreds of thousands of passengers how it would provide alternatives to their cancelled flights, after it announced a further 18,000 flights would be axed from its schedules. Ryanair promised to give full refunds, or rebooking on other Ryanair flights or comparable, low-cost carriers, as well as reimbursement of \u201creasonable out of pocket expenses\u201d. Ryanair has now told customers that those expenses include hotels and meals. The airline said it had emailed all customers again to clarify their rights to refunds, after a wave of criticism from passengers, government and consumer groups. But Ryanair also took a swipe at the CAA, claiming it had not enforced similar action on British Airways after the IT meltdown that caused widespread cancellations in May. The CAA said that Ryanair had \u201ccapitulated\u201d and it would monitor the airline to make sure that passengers got the compensation they were entitled to. The CAA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Haines, said: \u201cWhere we find that an airline is systematically flouting the rules, we will not hesitate to take action, to minimise the harm and detriment caused to passengers, as we have done with Ryanair in recent days. It appears that Ryanair has now capitulated. We will review their position in detail and monitor this situation to ensure that passengers get what they are entitled to in practice.\u201d Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said: \u201cWe apologise again sincerely for the disruption and inconvenience our rostering failure has caused some of our customers.\u201d He said more than 90% of the 400,000 customers affected by the latest schedule changes would be refunded or rebooked by Sunday, while 97% of the first wave of cancelled passengers had been helped already, while all were receiving travel vouchers as well. He added: \u201cWe have restored the reliability and punctuality of our flight operations. Over the past seven days we have operated over 15,000 flights with over 96% of our first wave morning departures operating on time, or with zero flight cancellations.\u201d Referring to the EU passenger compensation law, EU261, he added: \u201cWe have taken on extra customer service staff and are moving now to process and expedite all EU261 claims from affected customers. We are committed to processing all such claims within 21 days of receipt and hope to have all such claims settled before the end of October.\u201d Earlier this week, the CAA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Haines, had given Ryanair an ultimatum: \u201cThis issue is urgent, as passengers may already have been disadvantaged by taking a decision based on misleading information provided by Ryanair.\u201d The CAA set a Friday 5pm deadline for Ryanair to issue a press release addressing its concerns. The CAA had condemned Ryanair for wrongly claiming it was not obliged to arrange new flights for passengers on rival airlines, and \u201comitting material information\u201d about their rights. The airline said it would scrap 18,000 flights on 34 routes between November 2017 and March 2018, affecting nearly 400,000 passengers. The move came a week after a first wave of cancellations was announced, with the company citing a problem with pilots\u2019 rosters. A group of pilots on Friday appealed directly to Ryanair shareholders, urging them to call an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to quiz O\u2019Leary and his directors. They warned shareholders could see their investments suffer if they did not intervene to ensure the airline\u2019s relationship with pilots and cabin crew does not deteriorate. In an open letter, they said staff were disillusioned due to a \u201clack of wisdom, focus and a longer term strategy for the company\u201d, warning that the company could face a wave of resignations by experienced pilots. \u201cThe continuing problems at Ryanair show no signs of abating in the short term,\u201d they said. \u201cThe Ryanair pilot group and staff firmly believe that these problems will only get worse. Ryanair management seem to be adopting a \u2018head in the sand\u2019 attitude towards the pilot shortage, which has been widely acknowledged by the aviation industry.\u201d Ryanair has denied it has been affected by a shortage of pilots. \u201cWe feel that the shareholders should take action as soon as possible to protect their investments before these issues at Ryanair are compounded.\u201d The group said investors should use an EGM to question some of Ryanair\u2019s assertions about the severity of its flight cancellations and the likelihood that more will follow. They added that cancellations \u201cwill continue beyond March 2018 despite the communications from management\u201d. Passengers waiting to depart on flights from Luton airport on Friday were scathing about Ryanair. \u201cWe\u2019re just glad we are not flying with them,\u201d said Lianne Dolan, a nurse, ahead of flying to Amsterdam for a short break with 10 friends. Expectations of Ryanair were not high among any of the Luton passengers. Paul Carvall, 53, who was flying with the airline to Kerry for a wedding, said: \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to temper whatever you think about them with the fact that they are an out-and-out budget airline. Michael O\u2019Leary does set out his stall like that. \u201cHe\u2019s an abrasive fellow but he\u2019s from the school of no publicity is bad publicity. He\u2019s talked about passengers in the past being cattle, making them stand up, charging them for the toilet.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Ryanair has promised to notify all customers of their rights to compensation, including rebooking on other airlines, as it attempted to avert legal action by the UK aviation watchdog.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Civil Aviation Authority had ordered the airline to tell hundreds of thousands of passengers how it would provide alternatives to their cancelled flights, after it announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/27/ryanair-cancel-flights-passengers-stansted-edinburgh\">further 18,000 flights</a> would be axed from its schedules. <br></p> <p>Ryanair promised to give full refunds, or rebooking on other Ryanair flights or comparable, low-cost carriers, as well as reimbursement of \u201creasonable out of pocket expenses\u201d. Ryanair has now told customers that those expenses include hotels and meals.</p> <p>The airline said it had emailed all customers again to clarify their rights to refunds, after a wave of criticism from passengers, government and consumer groups. But Ryanair also took a swipe at the CAA, claiming it had not enforced similar action on British Airways after the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/03/ba-compendsation-bill-could-be-just-start-it-failure-iag\">IT meltdown</a> that caused widespread cancellations in May.</p> <p>The CAA said that Ryanair had \u201ccapitulated\u201d and it would monitor the airline to make sure that passengers got the compensation they were entitled to.</p> <p>The CAA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Haines, said: \u201cWhere we find that an airline is systematically flouting the rules, we will not hesitate to take action, to minimise the harm and detriment caused to passengers, as we have done with Ryanair in recent days. It appears that Ryanair has now capitulated. We will review their position in detail and monitor this situation to ensure that passengers get what they are entitled to in practice.\u201d</p> <p>Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said: \u201cWe apologise again sincerely for the disruption and inconvenience our rostering failure has caused some of our customers.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said more than 90% of the 400,000 customers affected by the latest schedule changes would be refunded or rebooked by Sunday, while 97% of the first wave of cancelled passengers had been helped already, while all were receiving travel vouchers as well. He added: \u201cWe have restored the reliability and punctuality of our flight operations. Over the past seven days we have operated over 15,000 flights with over 96% of our first wave morning departures operating on time, or with zero flight cancellations.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to the EU passenger compensation law, EU261, he added: \u201cWe have taken on extra customer service staff and are moving now to process and expedite all EU261 claims from affected customers. We are committed to processing all such claims within 21 days of receipt and hope to have all such claims settled before the end of October.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week, the CAA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Haines, had given Ryanair an ultimatum: \u201cThis issue is urgent, as passengers may already have been disadvantaged by taking a decision based on misleading information provided by Ryanair.\u201d The CAA set a Friday 5pm deadline for Ryanair to issue a press release addressing its concerns. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The CAA had condemned Ryanair for wrongly claiming it was not obliged to arrange new flights for passengers on rival airlines, and \u201comitting material information\u201d about their rights.</p> <p>The airline said it would scrap 18,000 flights on 34 routes between November 2017 and March 2018, affecting nearly 400,000 passengers.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up. A blizzard of economic data has highlighted problems in the UK economy today. Growth over the last 12 months has been revised down to just 1.5%, the lowest since 2013, despite a pick-up in business investment. The UK\u2019s current account deficit also widened, to over \u00a323bn, consumer credit has risen, and service sector growth seems to have cooled sharply in July. Jon Cunliffe, Chief Investment Officer of Charles Stanley, says: \u201cThe deterioration in the UK\u2019s current account position is disappointing, as it underlines that the sharp devaluation in Sterling has not fed through into a better trade position with the rest of the world. Analysts have also been predicting that London\u2019s housing market has hit a turning point, after prices fell by 0.6% over the last quarter. Details start here. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has had another busy day, telling the Today Programme that consumer debt is a concern, and that the Bank can\u2019t fix inequality (even though its monetary policy has distributive effects). He also repeated his warnings that borrowing costs could rise soon: Carney has also pledged to improve the bank\u2019s communications.....and been chastised by the chief economist of Citigroup for sticking his oar into the Scottish and Brexit referendums. Christine Lagarde, meanwhile, has predicted a world where digital currencies challenge traditional ones, and artificial intelligence plays a greater role in running our central banks. In the City, the FTSE 100 has jumped by around 0.75% today, while the pound has dipped to $1.341 following the growth downgrade. That\u2019s all for this week. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW We need to make the Bank of England more permeable and comprehensible, Mark Carney concludes, so that the public understands what it\u2019s up to. He admits that a middle-aged man in a blue suit reading out a speech simply doesn\u2019t cut it these day (even though that\u2019s exactly what Carney is doing right now). The Bank is trying to reach out to the public; officials have met 10,000 people at regional meetings, and it\u2019s holding a series of Town Hall events too. It has also racked up one million hits to its Bank Underground blog (which is well worth checking out) But....Carney says the BoE must do more, and use social media to keep the public better informed. We need to do a much better job of taking bite-sized bits of analysis, cut them and send them out so people can grab them understand what the trade-offs are in monetary policy, why the Phillips Curve has gone down... How much capital the banks really do have, and if house prices go down by a third what would happen to the banking sector. Some of it will be good, some of it will be incomprehensibly impermeable. At least Carney isn\u2019t setting the bar unrealistically high.... Carney then explains why he doesn\u2019t support calls for a new strategic body, involving the Treasury, to oversee systemic risk issues. Our current arrangement does involve picking up the phone when the chancellor phones...and phoning him up too when there\u2019s a financial stability problem, says Carney. Plus, the Bank must tell the government if it thinks taxpayers funds are at risk. Mark Carney is wrapping up his two-conference on central bank independence now. Governor Carney says the consensus from the meeting is that Bank of England independence has worked, but with several buts. One is that Britain hasn\u2019t yet tackled the \u2018too big to fail\u2019 problem \u2013 the fact that our largest banks would still need to be bailed out if they collapse. Carney says: Everywhere I\u2019m asked, when are we going to tackle the \u2018too big to fail\u2019 problem, and its fundamental unfairness. He explains that the Bank has all the tools it needs, but it hasn\u2019t yet completed the job. Carney also responds to Willem Buiter\u2019s scorching criticism of meddling central bankers, arguing that the Bank had a legal responsibility to express concerns over the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. If you\u2019re testifying at parliament and MPs ask you if Scottish independence has financial stability risks, \u2018you can\u2019t dodge it\u2019, says Carney. Professor Ngaire Woods of Oxford University takes issue with Willem Buiter\u2019s comments that central bankers should stick to monetary policy. She warns that this will simply make the Bank of England look remote and uncaring. The problem with a strict interpretation [of a central bank mandate] is that central banks will look like what most of the people in most countries think the elite look like -- people who are just not listening. Financial crises have led to the rise of the far-right, so it\u2019s really important that the Bank shows that it is listening to people\u2019s concerns, she adds. Clearly no-one told Willem Buiter that the Bank of England is having a celebration this week.... Back at the Bank of England\u2019s conference, Citigroup\u2019s Willem Buiter is delivering a forensic explanation of central bankers\u2019 failings since the financial crisis began. Buiter says central bank independence is under threat because the bankers themselves have failed to \u2018stick to their knitting\u2019, and instead have got involved in politics. He accuses them of becoming \u201cpartizans\u201d in the debate on fiscal policy, structural reforms, and inequality, including: the ECB\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d intervention in the Irish banking crisis, when Jean-Claude Trichet wrote to the Irish finance minister and effectively dictated fiscal policy. Mario Draghi\u2019s repeated calls for structural reforms in the eurozone The Bank of England\u2019s comments on Brexit, which received \u201ca very heated response from some of the Brexiteers\u201d. Trichet and Draghi\u2019s active role in the downfall of Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi This is compounded by the failure of monetary policy to do better since the financial crisis, Buiter continues. He says: Central banks have some output legitimacy, but have very little input legitimacy. And there is simply not enough accountability at some institutions. The ECB, for example, should start holding a formal vote at its meetings, and publish the results. This drop in London house prices could be a \u201cmilestone\u201d for prices in the capital, says Vicky Fowler, partner at law firm Gowling WLG. She believes that falling real wages are to blame, rather than an exodus of overseas buyers. Fowler explains: A recent Mayoral report highlighted that overseas investors count for just one in ten of the central London properties in current ownership. Recent figures highlighting a widespread decrease in wage levels throughout the UK could, therefore, be having more of an effect on the capital\u2019s property market than originally thought. \u201cIndeed, with Sadiq Khan having recently committed to the building of more affordable homes, one wonders if this could be the beginning of a downward trend where the proportion of London\u2019s properly affordable homes grows significantly and a corresponding downward pressure on land values\u201d. I missed this earlier (under the deluge of UK data), but eurozone inflation has come in below forecasts this month. Eurostat\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 estimate shows that prices in the euro area only rose by 1.5% in September, the same as in August. Economists had expected a rise to 1.6%. More significantly, core inflation (stripping out food and energy) fell from 1.2% to 1.1%. That means the European Central Bank\u2019s money-printing stimulus programme isn\u2019t having the effect Mario Draghi hoped for - so the ECB will probably keep printing for longer! Looking back at house prices... this charts shows how London properties are still waaaay beyond the average earner, despite dropping 0.6% over the last year. Christine Lagarde is also asked whether digital currencies could eventually mean that monetary policy becomes redundant. Q: If currencies are truly global...could we reach a point where exchange rate targeting is necessary as that\u2019s the only way that markets can decide the strength of a country\u2019s economy? Lagarde argues that in the short term, the fragmentation of the financial world makes central bankers more necessary. But eventually - who will set the value of money? The future will tell. Que sera sera, Lagarde smiles. Back on digital currencies....Christine Lagarde suggests that they could be included in the IMF\u2019s own basket of currencies, its \u2018special drawing rights\u2019. Lagarde warns that policymakers must remember that new technologies must work for all. This was neglected when everyone was \u201cbeating their chests\u201d about how globalisation was helping the world economy to grow. Let us make sure that these new technologies, and the way they will adapt the world economy, will benefit everyone, she concludes. Otherwise, by 2050 we might be \u201cvery sorry\u201d that we didn\u2019t remind ourselves of that today. Christine Lagarde also predicts a day when artificial intelligence plays a much bigger role in running the economy. She tells the Bank of England conference that artificial intelligence is improving fast. Even the world\u2019s best Go players have found themselves outmatched by computers, who could self-learn and develop better strategies. In a few decades time, we might find that smart machines are helping to run our central banks too. Lagarde says: Clearly the global economy is vastly more complex than a game of Go. But over the next generation machines will almost certainly play a much larger role in assisting policymakers offering realtime forecasts, spotting bubbles and uncovering complex financial links. Young economists shouldn\u2019t cry into their spreadsheets too much, though. Lagarde says humans will still be needed to run the system. And she also warns that the public may find it hard to trust computers - and could computers explain their decisions in plain English (something existing human central bankers have struggled with....). As Lagarde puts it: \u201cEven with the best algorithms and machines, targets will be missed, crises will occur, mistakes will be made. But can machines really be held accountable \u2014 to the young couple unable to buy a house, to the working mother finding herself unemployed? Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has warned central bankers not to close their eyes and ears to the rise of digital currencies. She\u2019s giving a speech on what the global economy will look like in 20 years, at the Bank of England\u2019s conference on central bank independence in London today. Lagarde says that digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, don\u2019t pose a major threat to the current status quo of fiat currencies today. Digital currencies are \u201ctoo volatile, too risky, too energy-intensive\u201d to replace traditional currencies today, she argues. They\u2019re not scalable enough, they\u2019re too opaque for regulators to get a grip on, and some have been hacked (for example, the Mt Gox bitcoin exchange which failed in 2014). But....in 20 years, this situation may have changed, says Lagarde. Eventually, digital currencies could become safer and more reliable, especially in less stable regions. The IMF chief predicts: \u201cSo in many ways, virtual currencies might just give existing currencies and monetary policy a run for their money. Central banks such as the BoE need to stay alert, for the moment when a digital currency \u201cknocks on the door\u201d and expects to be treated like sterling. Sterling has fallen, following the news that Britain\u2019s economy grew slower than expected over the last year. The pound has dropped by over half a cent against the US dollar to $1.338, which is nearly a two-week low. That\u2019s despite Mark Carney\u2019s latest hint that interest rates will probably rise soon. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says this morning\u2019s growth figures have hit sentiment in the City. Softer GDP data for the second quarter of 1.5%, down from previous estimates of 1.7%, triggered the slide in the pound, which was already looking a little vulnerable following recent moves. Concerns over the ongoing Brexit talks may also be hitting the pound. Earlier today, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned that it will take \u201cmiracles\u201d for the two sides to start discussing their future relationship next month. Adam Posen, a former Bank of England policymaker, says central bankers cannot ignore the fact that they make us all richer, or poorer, by their actions. Posen was speaking at the Bank\u2019s conference on independence (you can follow it live, here). He\u2019s not responding directly to Mark Carney\u2019s comments on inequality (details here), but he\u2019s put his finger on the underlying issue. Namely, monetary policy has distributional effects. Carney\u2019s argument is that it\u2019s up to governments to address that - most likely by changing the tax rate to claw back money from wealthier citizens who benefit when the Bank drives up asset prices through its QE asset purchase scheme. Posen says that central bankers have to be open about the fact that they are making a choice between inflation and unemployment when they set interest rates. Monetary policy dictates how fast prices rise, or how many more people join the ranks of the unemployed. For 20 or 30 years, Posen says, central bankers have \u201cgot away with arguing that they only focus on aggregates\u201d - ie, the overall impact of their policies. But that era is over; if central bankers want to keep the public\u2019s support, they need to be more explicit about the impact of their actions. Monetary policy does have its limits, of course; Posen also reminds us that some central bankers are looking to governments to do more. Posen wraps up with this quote from Jane Austen (who now appears on the new \u00a310). In more disappointing news, the UK\u2019s current account deficit has widened (yes, there\u2019s a lot of data out this morning). The ONS reports that the current account deficit jumped to \u00a323.2bn in April to June, up from \u00a322.3bn in January to March. This was mainly caused by a rise in foreign earnings on investment in the UK, which is growing faster than Britain\u2019s own earnings overseas. The trade deficit narrowed, though, to \u00a36.5bn thanks to a rise in exports. New figures also show that Britain\u2019s consumers continue to ramp up their borrowings. Figures show that consumer credit jumped by \u00a31.58bn in August, up from \u00a31.2bn in July. This may alarm Mark Carney given his comments about \u2018frothy\u2019 debt this morning. It suggests more people are turning to credit to finance new purchases, or to cover the gap between wages and inflation. Worryingly, the ONS also warns that Britain\u2019s service sector had a bad July, with its \u201cIndex of Services\u201d decreasing by 0.2% during the month. The ONS says: The largest contribution to the month-on-month decrease came from the transport, storage and communication sector, which contributed negative 0.22 percentage points The industry largely responsible for the fall on the month was motion pictures, which contributed negative 0.19 percentage points; this decrease follows a particularly strong June for the industry. These new UK growth figures also show that business investment has picked up, but the economy is still barely growing once you adjust for population changes. Here\u2019s som key points: GDP per head grew by 0.1% in April-June, much slower than the headline growth of 0.3% Business investment rose by 0.5% during the quarter (revised up from 0%). Household spending rose by 0.2% (revised up from 0.1%) The Household Savings Ratio rose to 5.4%, highest since Q3 2016 Breaking: Britain\u2019s annual growth rate has been revised down. UK GDP rose by just 1.5% annually in the second quarter of 2017, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. That\u2019s down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%, and is the slowest annual growth since 2013. However, growth during the quarter was unrevised, at 0.3%. The service sector was the only part of the economy that grew. More to follow.... Brexit has helped to push London\u2019s housing market to an \u2018inflection point\u2019, says Nicholas Finn, executive director of Garrington Property Finders. \u201cThe softening of prices was initially led by the capital\u2019s prime market, which was knocked sideways both by Brexit and in the wake of the introduction of higher rates of stamp duty for high-value homes. \u201cBut it is now spreading from the central boroughs \u2013 which saw prices rise fastest during the boom \u2013 to other areas where the growth came later. \u201cAs a result the market is at an inflection point, as the froth evaporates and prices gently correct to more realistic levels. The decline in London house prices will make it a little easier for people to break into the housing market (although with average prices of \u00a3471,761, the capital is well beyond most pay packets). Here\u2019s Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, says: \u201cThe market seems to be cooling slightly in London which will hopefully give people more of a chance to get on the housing ladder \u2013 despite still being the most expensive region. \u201cPrices are still on the rise for the rest of the country, with the East Midlands seeing the greatest price increase. It\u2019s important here to make sure you do your research before you buy to get the best deal. Here are some more charts from the Nationwide house price survey (details start here, if you\u2019re just joining us) Mark Carney also insists that the Bank of England isn\u2019t to blame for economic inequality. Asked if capitalism is broken, the BoE governor tells the Today Programme there are two foundations of prosperity - price stability (steady inflation), and financial stability (banks that don\u2019t blow up). The gap between rich and poor are crucial issues, but these are issues for the government and broader society. They are not the responsibility of the Bank of England. The BoE\u2019s job is to use its toolkit to prevent another financial crisis, Carney continues: The people who get hurt when inflation goes up, or banks go down, are the poorest people in society. Without question, time and time again. Our job is to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen, then the taxpayer doesn\u2019t have to bailout someone in the City. There are a host of other things that need to happen to growth the economy, and then society has to decide how to distribute the gains of that growth, not the Bank of England. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has just gone a few rounds with John Humphrys on the Today Programme. Carney has given another hint that UK interest rates could rise \u201cin the coming months\u201d, if the economy continues on its current course. Q: So what effect will this have on people ladled with debt - we\u2019ve got a debt bubble building? Carney insists that Britain isn\u2019t experiencing another debt bubble, pointing out that households have deleveraged since the financial crisis. But, the overall level of debt is now rising (in line with GDP) , and the Bank is increasingly concerned that banks are shifting from responsible lending to reckless lending. Some lending to consumers is getting \u201ca little frothy and should be addressed\u201d, Carney says sternly. He cites a \u201cpocket of consumer debt\u201d, including credit card debts, debt for cars and personal loans, which is growing at 10% per year. Carney says many of these loans are to higher-quality borrowers than before, but still.... We think banks have been giving too much credit for a relatively good economic environment, and not being as disciplined as they should be about their underwriting standards and their pricing on this debt. In other words, banks aren\u2019t being prudent enough, and making loans that would turn sour if the economy hits trouble. Carney also rejected calls from former PM Gordon Brown for a new supervisory board to help the Bank handle systemic risks. He argues that the current system of Bank independence is \u201cincredibly well designed\u201d, letting Carney and his colleagues support financial stability and keep banks supporting the economy. We have a responsibility to identify risks across the economy \u2014 and come on the Today Programme, go round the country, and highlight where there are emerging vulnerabilities. Hopefully we have powers to deal with them, but at least we have to surface them. London\u2019s \u2018unsustainable\u2019 house price boom is over, and not before time, says Alex Gosling, CEO of online estate agents HouseSimple.com. The London property market has enjoyed almost a decade of phenomenal growth. But year after year of double digit growth was unsustainable and inevitably going to come to an end at some point. That point looks like now.\u201d The Government\u2019s reform of the stamp duty bands and the introduction of a second home stamp duty surcharge have hit the London housing market more than any other region. Brexit fears are also scaring off overseas investors who came to the rescue and supported the London market during the dark years after the financial crash. Many Londoners will actually be hoping that house prices continue to fall until they reach an affordable level, Gosling continues. Their wish may well come true.\u201d This chart from housing expert Neal Hudson shows how the UK housing market has cooled this year. Nationwide also reports that prices in the North of England are rising faster than in the South. And not before time, arguably, as the gap has doubled over last 10 years. It now costs an extra \u00a3171,000 buy a house in the South of England. The real shock isn\u2019t that London house prices are falling, it\u2019s that they rose so high for so long. So argues Lee James Pendleton, head of independent estate agents James Pendleton. He hopes that a drop in prices will help more people into the market. \u201cLondon has been the torchbearer of quite unbelievable growth in recent years but it has been an overvalued market for at least the last three years. \u201cThis shows vendors and agents are becoming more realistic but you\u2019ve got to use an agent that is going to tell you what you need hear. People have got so used to prices going up and the result is too many people have been priced out. London cooling is going to really engage buyers and put us on a better, more stable footing towards the end of the year. Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender, Octane Capital, reckons a correction to London prices was overdue. \u201cThe London property market has been the victim of its own extraordinary success. Prices in the capital rose to such a level that a correction was always on the cards. Extreme supply issues within the M25 coupled with always-on demand will mean the London market can only fall so much. \u201cIn reality the ongoing correction will be a positive in the longer term. Even by London standards, prices in some areas of the capital had become frankly absurd. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, says house prices in London are now falling because they rose beyond the reach of most people. Plus, potential buyers are also cautious because the Bank of England may raise interest rates soon. Brexit doesn\u2019t help, either. Leaf says: The London market is struggling for mainly affordability reasons and it is only those sellers who recognise the changed market conditions that are doing deals. \u2018Buyers and sellers are still nervous about prospects for the market in view of lack of perceived progress in Brexit negotiations and concerns about imminent rises in interest rates.\u2019 BREAKING: London house prices have fallen for the first time since the depths of the financial crisis. Prices in the capital fell by 0.6%, annually, in the last quarter, according to a new survey from the Nationwide building society. This is the first decline since the third quarter of 2009, and makes London the worst-performing region of the UK (although also still the most expensive). While London struggled, the East Midlands region showed the strongest growth with prices up 5.1%. Across the UK, Nationwide reports that prices rose by 2.0% per year in September, down from 2.1% in August. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.2% during September, with the average house now costing \u00a3210,116 (that\u2019s seasonally adjusted). Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, says house prices across the UK are \u201cconverging\u201d. Annual growth rates in the south of England have moderated towards those prevailing in the rest of the country. London has seen a particularly marked slowdown, with prices falling in annual terms for the first time in eight years, albeit by a modest 0.6% Consequently, London was the weakest performing region for the first time since 2005. Gardner believes the squeeze on household incomes is now hitting the housing market: Low mortgage rates and healthy rates of employment growth are providing some support for demand, but this is being partly offset by pressure on household incomes, which appear to be weighing on confidence. The lack of homes on the market is providing ongoing support to prices. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a new, more detailed estimate on UK growth in the second quarter of this year. It\u2019s likely to confirm that GDP rose by a mere 0.3%, and will also show how business investment held up during the quarter. The Office for National Statistics will also be announcing some chunky revisions to the UK\u2019s national accounts. They\u2019re expected to show that households are saving more than previously thought, but the balance of payments could show an even bigger deficit than before. Also, the Bank of England will be holding the second day of its conference into central bank independence. You can follow it here. Yesterday\u2019s event heard plenty of warnings that rising populism, and public concerns over unorthodox stimulus programmes, risk undermining central banks. City economists will also be watching out for the latest eurozone inflation data; the eurozone CPI may rise to 1.6% from 1.5%. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30am BST: Third estimate of UK GDP in Q2 2017 10am BST: Eurozone inflation figures for September 11.30am: IMF chief Christine Lagarde gives a keynote speech at the Bank of England\u2019s conference on independence",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An explosion is under way in the popcorn business: the all-American snack has become Britain\u2019s fastest-growing grocery product. While sales of crisps have declined for the third year running, popcorn sales \u2013 driven by new gourmet flavours including goat\u2019s cheese, teriyaki, and gin and tonic \u2013 are surging, doubling in value since 2013. With sales up more than 10% this year, to \u00a3152m, the UK\u2019s snack fans now munch twice as much popcorn as any other European nation. Only Americans eat more. Market research experts put popcorn\u2019s popularity down to perceived health benefits compared with traditional potato crisps. \u201cBritish consumers are moving away from traditional snacks because of increasing health concerns,\u201d said Mike Kruiniger, an analyst at Euromonitor, the research firm behind the new data, because \u201cit\u2019s air-popped instead of fried\u201d. Popcorn\u2019s unlikely health halo \u2013 low in calories, high in fibre and gluten-free \u2013 is seen as key to its meteoric rise. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the old movie theatre popcorn \u2013 with those small pieces at the bottom that chip your teeth. Our stuff is all about natural ingredients,\u201d says Adam Sopher, founder of Joe &amp; Seph\u2019s, a trendy new popcorn maker. Inspired by his father (\u201cmost parents would cook their kids spaghetti bolognese, but my dad cooked us popcorn\u201d), Sopher, 32, launched his brand six years ago with \u00a320,000 of savings. The business is now turning over \u00a35m a year and earlier this month went on sale nationwide in Waitrose. \u201cI never imagined it would grow like this,\u201d, he says. \u201cPopcorn barely existed as a category \u2013 now there are entire supermarket bays dedicated to it. I think it\u2019s because consumers are much more interested in foodie stuff these days and wanting to try new things.\u201d Another brand driving the popcorn resurgence, Propercorn, made its first batch using a cement mixer and a spray-paint kit. \u201cI needed something to get the oil to stick,\u201d says Cassandra Stavrou, the brand\u2019s founder. \u201cAnd the way you spray paint cars is the finest mist you can get. We\u2019ve got a much bigger and shinier set-up now, but it\u2019s the same principle.\u201d Stavrou\u2019s passion for popcorn dates back to her teenage years when she received a popcorn maker as a gift. \u201cWe were one of the first new breed of popcorn brands, taking it from the floor of the cinema into something that was the official snack of London fashion week,\u201d Stavrou says. Launched six years ago, Propercorn now sells more than 3m bags a month. It\u2019s in all the usual high-end retailers, she says, but you can also buy it as part of a meal deal at Tesco. It has also recently launched into the hyper-competitive kids\u2019 snack market with colourful grab bags in flavours such as tomato ketchup. Small wonder, then, that crisp makers are getting edgy, and no surprise they are looking for a piece of the action themselves. Walkers has launched Sensations popcorn in July this year, while Hula Hoops maker KP Snacks swooped on Butterkist. The size of the popcorn market is still dwarfed by the \u00a32bn Britons spend on crisps every year, despite the slowdown in sales. But there\u2019s also no doubting that health-conscious Brits are looking around for alternative fat-free snacks, and popcorn is on the rise. Emma Clifford, a food analyst with Mintel, says it\u2019s a snack that\u2019s \u201cwinning on all fronts\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s got that holy grail of healthiness but also tasting good,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s showing no sign of slowing down.\u201d",

Only Americans eat more. </p> <p>Market research experts put popcorn\u2019s popularity down to perceived health benefits compared with traditional potato crisps.</p> <p>\u201cBritish consumers are moving away from traditional snacks because of increasing health concerns,\u201d said Mike Kruiniger, an analyst at Euromonitor, the research firm behind the new data, because \u201cit\u2019s air-popped instead of fried\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2846bc7cfe14be1638e1d7f7f123522393c7b529\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2846bc7cfe14be1638e1d7f7f123522393c7b529/387_0_1577_2365/667.jpg\" alt=\"Joe & Seph\u2019s popcorn: launched six years ago\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe &amp; Seph\u2019s popcorn: launched six years ago</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Popcorn\u2019s unlikely health halo \u2013 low in calories, high in fibre and gluten-free \u2013 is seen as key to its meteoric rise.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like the old movie theatre popcorn \u2013 with those small pieces at the bottom that chip your teeth. Our stuff is all about natural ingredients,\u201d says Adam Sopher, founder of Joe &amp; Seph\u2019s, a trendy new popcorn maker.</p> <p>Inspired by his father (\u201cmost parents would cook their kids spaghetti bolognese, but my dad cooked us popcorn\u201d), Sopher, 32, launched his brand six years ago with \u00a320,000 of savings. The business is now turning over \u00a35m a year and earlier this month went on sale nationwide in Waitrose.</p> <p>\u201cI never imagined it would grow like this,\u201d, he says. \u201cPopcorn barely existed as a category \u2013 now there are entire supermarket bays dedicated to it. I think it\u2019s because consumers are much more interested in foodie stuff these days and wanting to try new things.\u201d</p> <p>Another brand driving the popcorn resurgence, Propercorn, made its first batch using a cement mixer and a spray-paint kit.</p> <p>\u201cI needed something to get the oil to stick,\u201d says Cassandra Stavrou, the brand\u2019s founder. \u201cAnd the way you spray paint cars is the finest mist you can get. We\u2019ve got a much bigger and shinier set-up now, but it\u2019s the same principle.\u201d</p> <p>Stavrou\u2019s passion for popcorn dates back to her teenage years when she received a popcorn maker as a gift.</p> <p>\u201cWe were one of the first new breed of popcorn brands, taking it from the floor of the cinema into something that was the official snack of London fashion week,\u201d Stavrou says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a3041cacf060690c59d757564ddf59ea86ab79e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a3041cacf060690c59d757564ddf59ea86ab79e/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Propercorn: \u2018one of the first new breed of popcorn brands\u2019, says founder Cassandra Stavrou.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Propercorn: \u2018one of the first new breed of popcorn brands\u2019, says founder Cassandra Stavrou.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Launched six years ago, Propercorn now sells more than 3m bags a month.

Walkers has launched Sensations popcorn in July this year, while Hula Hoops maker KP Snacks swooped on Butterkist.</p> <p>The size of the popcorn market is still dwarfed by the \u00a32bn Britons spend on crisps every year, despite the slowdown in sales. But there\u2019s also no doubting that health-conscious Brits are looking around for alternative fat-free snacks, and popcorn is on the rise.</p> <p>Emma Clifford, a food analyst with Mintel, says it\u2019s a snack that\u2019s \u201cwinning on all fronts\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s got that holy grail of healthiness but also tasting good,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s showing no sign of slowing down.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer, Aldi and Lidl have suspended buying chicken from 2 Sisters Food Group\u2019s West Bromwich plant following a Guardian and ITV News investigation that found evidence it had tampered with food safety records. The moves came as the Food Standards Agency said its inspectors had audited the site on Thursday, as it announced its own investigation on the back of the Guardian\u2019s and ITV\u2019s evidence of potential regulatory breaches at the chicken processor. The regulator also urged \u201canyone with information for this investigation\u201d to make contact. A spokesman for Marks &amp; Spencer said on Friday: \u201cWe have commenced an immediate investigation into these allegations and will not be taking any more product from the West Bromwich site until it has concluded to our satisfaction. \u201cAs per our statement yesterday, the standards shown in the footage are unacceptable, we take hygiene and traceability very seriously and have extremely high production standards.\u201d Aldi said: \u201cWe have suspended supply from this site while we carry out an urgent investigation into these allegations. We expect all suppliers to adhere to the highest possible food hygiene and traceability standards at all times.\u201d Lidl added: \u201cLidl UK takes the issue of food safety extremely seriously and we were very disappointed to see the unacceptable standards shown in yesterday\u2019s report. We immediately launched an investigation with the supplier and can confirm that we will not be sourcing from those sites until the investigations have been satisfactorily concluded\u201d. Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019sare also carrying out investigations into the 2SFG plant in West Bromwich, where the evidence of potential breaches was filmed. All five supermarkets are supplied by the plant. The Food Standards Agency said: \u201cFollowing allegations made in an undercover report from ITV News and the Guardian, Food Standards Agency inspectors went into the plant in question [on Thursday] to begin our investigation. \u201cOur inspectors found no evidence of breaches. However we continue to review the evidence and if any incidences of non-compliance are found we will take prompt and proportionate action with the business concerned, working closely with the local authority. \u201cWe would urge ITV and the Guardian to share any additional evidence, including witness statements, that would inform our investigation. This particular cutting plant is regularly audited by the FSA and they are also subject to unannounced inspections. The FSA urges anyone with information for this investigation to contact them.\u201d On Thursday, an investigation by the Guardian and ITV News revealed undercover footage of an instance of workers altering the slaughter date of poultry at a 2 Sisters Food Group plant in West Bromwich. Workers at the company confirmed they had been asked to switch the labels on other occasions. Experts said changing \u201ckill dates\u201d could artificially stretch the commercial life of meat products by triggering the food processor to print incorrect use-by dates on supermarket packaging. It is illegal to place incorrect use-by dates on food, which are set for safety reasons and differ from \u201cbest before\u201d dates. 2SFG said it had not been given enough time or detail to investigate the allegations, but that \u201chygiene and food safety will always be the number one priority within the business, and they remain at its very core\u201d. It added: \u201cWe also successfully operate in one of the most tightly controlled and highly regulated food sectors in the world. We are subject to multiple and frequent unannounced audits from the FSA, BRC, Red Tractor, independent auditors as well as our customers. By example, our facility in the West Midlands under investigation received nine audits (five unannounced) in the months of July and August alone.\u201d The discovery comes just four years after the 2013 horsemeat scandal, which has resulted in prison sentences for those convicted of a conspiracy to pass off cheaper horsemeat as beef. Paul Flynn, a Labour member of the Commons environment, food and rural affairs select committee, said the allegations could damage the UK\u2019s ability to market foods after leaving the EU, adding he would raise the matter at the committee\u2019s next meeting. He said: \u201cThe foundations of trust in the quality of British food will be shaken by the Guardian\u2019s and ITV\u2019s evidence. \u201cIt challenges the canard that UK standards are the among the world\u2019s best. The reputational damage could profoundly undermine our ability to market foods to new customers in the tumultuous Brexit future. \u201cI believe this is a matter of grave concern that demands the attention of the Efra committee.\u201d The joint investigation, which involved taking secret recordings during a spell of 12 working days inside 2 Sisters\u2019 plant in West Bromwich, also captured evidence that: \u2022 Chicken portions returned by supermarket distribution centres are being repackaged by 2 Sisters and sent out again to major grocers. \u2022 Workers drop chickens on the floor of the processing plant and return them to the production line. \u2022 Workers alter records of where chickens were slaughtered, potentially hindering authorities from recalling contaminated meat during food scares. \u2022 Chickens slaughtered on different dates are mixed on the production line. Workers said use-by dates printed on the packets of the mixed chicken tended to reflect the age of the freshest, rather than oldest, meat in the batch. Having been shown the evidence, Prof Chris Elliott, a food safety academic from Queen\u2019s University Belfast who led the UK government\u2019s independent review of food systems after the 2013 horsemeat scandal, said: \u201cOver the past three to four years I have conducted many inspections of food businesses right across the UK. I have never seen one operate under such poor standards as your video evidence shows. \u201cI think [this] absolutely calls out for a full investigation. We need to get environmental health officers, we need to get the Food Standards Agency to do a thorough investigation. The Food Standards Agency will take this very seriously. They will look at the premises and see if there are grounds to close the facility down.\u201d The company said it had not been given enough time or detail to respond to the allegations, which it described as \u201cfalse\u201d. A letter from 2 Sisters Food Group\u2019s legal advisers, Schillings, said: \u201cFood safety and hygiene are 2SFG\u2019s top priorities. To the extent that you have identified any shortcomings (which is not admitted), these could only be isolated examples which our clients would take very seriously, and they are investigating the allegations made.\u201d During the course of the investigation, the Guardian and ITV News interviewed more than 20 workers at 2 Sisters about standards within the company. One worker said: \u201cI have [changed the slaughter dates] lots of times when I was working in that area. My supervisor, he asked me to do it \u2026 If you are buying fresh chicken it can be older chicken.\u201d A second worker claimed that 2 Sisters quality control staff in the West Midlands were working in a \u201cpointless job\u201d and could feel intimidated and be overruled by production supervisors who treated them as \u201cenemies\u201d. On one occasion the Guardian/ITV News footage captured workers altering the \u201ckill date\u201d of hundreds of chickens to one day later at the group\u2019s West Bromwich plant in August. Other workers added that they had witnessed dates being altered by more than a day. Supermarket products typically have a use-by date around 10 days after the bird has been slaughtered. Speaking about how chicken is returned by supermarket distribution centres, a third 2 Sisters worker said: \u201cThey will repack [the returned meat] like [it is] today\u2019s production ... It is sent back on [the line] like today\u2019s production. They mix it with today\u2019s production.\u201d Supermarkets return chicken to suppliers for a variety of reasons that can include packaging and labelling errors. Being returned does not mean it is unfit to eat. However, if older meat is mixed with fresher meat, the use-by date should reflect the age of the oldest meat in the batch. A fourth worker added: \u201cI try to make them change the [use-by] date to [reflect the] older DOK [date of kill] but that doesn\u2019t happen \u2013 they mix.\u201d The footage shows chicken that has been processed and packed for Lidl being reopened and mixed with other pieces of poultry. The drumsticks re-emerge at the end of the line in packets saying they have come from Tesco\u2019s Willow Farms. The labelling on the pack says the contents are \u201creared exclusively for Tesco\u201d. Schillings said: \u201cThe Willow Farms brand is exclusive to Tesco, but the raw material is not. 2SFG meets the raw materials specifications for the Willow Farms brand.\u201d The Guardian and ITV News showed the undercover footage to four government meat inspectors, who would speak only on condition of anonymity. All of them said they believed the film showed potential breaches of food regulations. Food law experts also added that the film amounted to prima facie evidence that the company had potentially committed offences. Dr Richard Hyde, an expert in food law at Nottingham University, added: \u201cIf you are placing a use-by date that is incorrect that is a breach of law. If you place food on the market that doesn\u2019t have the correct traceability information that is a criminal offence. There are a basket of potential offences here that the regulators need to look at and decide whether further action is required.\u201d The food processor said that Elliott and Hyde had not visited 2 Sisters sites or considered its policies, so their comments \u201ccannot be, in any way, objective expert evidence, but are completely unbalanced, based on biased selective information\u201d. 2 Sisters Food Group is the UK\u2019s second largest food company by turnover and claims to process around 6 million chickens every week. It is owned by Ranjit Singh Boparan and his wife, Baljinder Kaur Boparan, and the chicken operations \u2013 which include 12 sites in the UK \u2013 are part of a sprawling \u00a33bn food empire that separately includes the turkey producer Bernard Matthews, the restaurant chains Harry Ramsden, FishWorks and Giraffe, plus food brands such as Fox\u2019s Biscuits and Goodfella\u2019s pizza. The Boparans, who have always shunned publicity, are worth \u00a3544m, according to the Sunday Times rich list. The company added: \u201c2SFG ensures all staff are fully trained on hygiene and safety matters, and enforces a number of policies to ensure compliance with all regulations. It is subject to regular audits in these areas and staff have a number of ways in which to voice their concerns. \u201c2SFG has reviewed its [whistleblower hotline] records for Site D from the previous 12 months and there are no complaints from any quality assurance staff resembling those cited.\u201d The five big supermarkets supplied by 2 Sisters\u2019 West Bromwich plant all said they took quality and safety standards very seriously and were investigating. A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe operate to the highest possible food quality and safety standards, carrying out our own regular audits at all of our suppliers to ensure these standards are maintained. As such, we take these allegations extremely seriously and will be carrying out our own rigorous investigation.\u201d A Lidl spokesperson said: \u201cLidl UK takes the issue of food safety extremely seriously and, as such, we conduct independent audits to ensure that our high quality and safety standards are met. Therefore, we are very disappointed to learn of these allegations and will be urgently investigating this matter with the supplier.\u201d Additional reporting by Olivier Acu\u00f1a.",

Workers said use-by dates printed on the packets of the mixed chicken tended to reflect the age of the freshest, rather than oldest, meat in the batch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7bcbdf1b1e654de1eb3479b9136c2d2556341bd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7bcbdf1b1e654de1eb3479b9136c2d2556341bd/44_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken is picked up from the floor for processing in the West Midlands plant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicken is picked up from the floor for processing in the West Midlands plant.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian/ITV</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Having been shown the evidence, Prof Chris Elliott, a food safety academic from Queen\u2019s University Belfast who led the UK government\u2019s independent review of food systems after the 2013 horsemeat scandal, said: \u201cOver the past three to four years I have conducted many inspections of food businesses right across the UK. I have never seen one operate under such poor standards as your video evidence shows.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think [this] absolutely calls out for a full investigation. We need to get environmental health officers, we need to get the Food Standards Agency to do a thorough investigation. The Food Standards Agency will take this very seriously. They will look at the premises and see if there are grounds to close the facility down.\u201d</p> \n<p>The company said it had not been given enough time or detail to respond to the allegations, which it described as \u201cfalse\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ccbb777a-4f5f-48e7-a98d-5cb6a5fb27a2\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Explainer\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A letter from 2 Sisters Food Group\u2019s legal advisers, Schillings, said: \u201cFood safety and hygiene are 2SFG\u2019s top priorities. To the extent that you have identified any shortcomings (which is not admitted), these could only be isolated examples which our clients would take very seriously, and they are investigating the allegations made.\u201d</p> \n<p>During the course of the investigation, the Guardian and ITV News interviewed more than 20 workers at 2 Sisters about standards within the company.<br></p> \n<p>One worker said: \u201cI have [changed the slaughter dates] lots of times when I was working in that area. My supervisor, he asked me to do it \u2026 If you are buying fresh chicken it can be older chicken.\u201d</p> \n<p>A second worker claimed that 2 Sisters quality control staff in the West Midlands were working in a \u201cpointless job\u201d and could feel intimidated and be overruled by production supervisors who treated them as \u201cenemies\u201d.</p> \n<p>On one occasion the Guardian/ITV News footage captured workers altering the \u201ckill date\u201d of hundreds of chickens to one day later at the group\u2019s West Bromwich plant in August. Other workers added that they had witnessed dates being altered by more than a day.</p> \n<p>Supermarket products typically have a use-by date around 10 days after the bird has been slaughtered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/boparan-in-numbers-zip/giv-3902Gxj6Ef9I5Ve3/\" data-alt=\"2 Sisters in numbers\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/boparan-in-numbers-zip/giv-3902Gxj6Ef9I5Ve3/\">2 Sisters in numbers</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking about how chicken is returned by supermarket distribution centres, a third 2 Sisters worker said: \u201cThey will repack [the returned meat] like [it is] today\u2019s production ... It is sent back on [the line] like today\u2019s production. They mix it with today\u2019s production.\u201d</p> \n<p>Supermarkets return chicken to suppliers for a variety of reasons that can include packaging and labelling errors. Being returned does not mean it is unfit to eat. However, if older meat is mixed with fresher meat, the use-by date should reflect the age of the oldest meat in the batch.</p> \n<p>A fourth worker added: \u201cI try to make them change the [use-by] date to [reflect the] older DOK [date of kill] but that doesn\u2019t happen \u2013 they mix.\u201d </p> \n<p>The footage shows chicken that has been processed and packed for Lidl being reopened and mixed with other pieces of poultry. The drumsticks re-emerge at the end of the line in packets saying they have come from Tesco\u2019s Willow Farms. The labelling on the pack says the contents are \u201creared exclusively for Tesco\u201d.</p> \n<p>Schillings said: \u201cThe Willow Farms brand is exclusive to Tesco, but the raw material is not. 2SFG meets the raw materials specifications for the Willow Farms brand.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian and ITV News showed the undercover footage to four government meat inspectors, who would speak only on condition of anonymity.

      "bodyText": "Three former Tesco directors were the \u201cgenerals\u201d who \u201cbullied and coerced\u201d employees to massage profits and mislead the stock market, a court has heard. Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK, John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, and Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK, have all been charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. The three men, who appeared together at Southwark crown court in London for the opening of the case on Friday, could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of fraud and seven years for false accounting. They deny any wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty. Sasha Wass QC, a lawyer for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), told the jury: \u201cThis case amounts to what\u2019s called cooking the books. \u201cThe three defendants on trial are not the foot soldiers. The defendants in this case are the generals in a position of trust and had huge compensation packages to safeguard the financial health of Tesco.\u201d Wass said they \u201cencouraged the manipulation of profits and pressured others under their control to misconduct themselves in such a way that the stock market was ultimately misled.\u201d She said they had pressed, \u201cbullied and coerced\u201d those under them to falsify figures so that income was recorded when it should not have been. The allegations relate to accounts records at Tesco which the company eventually said left a hole of up to \u00a3326m. The SFO launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014. The charges allege that the defendants dishonestly falsified Tesco\u2019s digital accounting records and its draft interim accounts by the \u201cinputting of and/or reliance upon commercial income figures which gave a false account of the financial position of Tesco\u201d. Wass said Rogberg had withheld critical information from Tesco\u2019s auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers, which had been \u201cmisled and lied to\u201d, and knowingly entered false figures into Tesco\u2019s computerised accounting system. She said Bush had confirmed the figures knowing they were false, while Scouler knew income had been incorrectly pulled forward from future years creating a hole in the accounts. She added that the problems at Tesco had started in 2013 when the company faced increasing competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl and announced its first drop in profits in 20 years. She said the company\u2019s response was to set \u201caggressive and unrealistic\u201d profit targets which employees where then expected to meet. The failure to meet targets was \u201ccamouflaged by falsely representing the true position\u201d and it became \u201cdifficult to see which figures were real and which not real\u201d. By early 2014, during the period the SFO alleges fraud occurred, Wass said the defendants were aware that bad practices had developed that were overstating profits and \u201cjeopardising the financial health of the company\u201d. Wass made clear that the prosecution would be relying on a report prepared by Amit Soni, an employee in the finance department of Tesco who reported to Rogberg. Soni, and one of his team, had prepared what they called \u201cthe legacy paper\u201d which identified the scale of misreporting at Tesco at about \u00a3250m. She said it provided \u201cclear evidence that each of the defendants had connived over the manipulation of targets to conceal their failure and keep their salary and bonuses\u201d. Wass said when Soni\u2019s report was presented to the Tesco board of directors, the extent of the misreported profits it revealed \u201cwas like a hand grenade had been thrown into the company\u201d. When the board decided they had to make a public announcement revealing they had misinformed the market, \u201cnot only did Tesco shares fall by nearly 12%, wiping over \u00a32bn off the total share value, but the credibility of Tesco itself and indeed the credibility of the stock market had been undermined,\u201d Wass said. She said losses had been suffered not only by those investing in the stock market, but by all of those holding Tesco shares, including pension funds and people simply trying to save. The trial, expected to last 13 weeks, continues.",

    "webTitle": "London house prices fall for first time in eight years as rest of UK rises", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "London house prices fell for the first time year-on-year since the height of the financial crisis eight years ago, underperforming the rest of the UK, Nationwide has said. The average price of a home in the capital is \u00a3471,761, down by 0.6% between July and September compared with the same period last year. It was the first drop since the third quarter of 2009, when the UK economy was dealing with the aftershocks of the near-collapse of the global banking system. London was the only region in the UK where prices fell over the third quarter, making the capital the weakest-performing region for the first time since 2005. On a national level, house prices rose 2.2% to \u00a3210,982. East Midlands was the strongest performer, with prices up 5.1% at \u00a3177,825. While London remains easily the most expensive place to buy a property in the UK, Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said the gap between house price growth in different regions was closing. \u201cHouse price growth rates across the UK have converged in recent quarters,\u201d he said. \u201cAnnual growth rates in the south of England have moderated towards those prevailing in the rest of the country. London has seen a particularly marked slowdown, with prices falling in annual terms for the first time in eight years.\u201d Analysts said that a combination of unsustainable growth in prices, higher stamp duty on second homes \u2013 which has affected the London market more than any other region \u2013 and Brexit fears, were all weighing on prices in London. Weakness that began with London\u2019s most expensive homes in central London appears to be rippling through to the capital\u2019s outer boroughs, taking prices towards what analysts said were more realistic levels. \u201cThe capital\u2019s gravity-defying, double-digit rates of annual price growth were always going to be unsustainable,\u201d said Nicholas Finn, the executive director of London-based Garrington Property Finders. \u201cThe softening of prices was initially led by the capital\u2019s prime market, which was knocked sideways both by Brexit and in the wake of the introduction of higher rates of stamp duty for high-value homes. But it is now spreading from the central boroughs \u2013 which saw prices rise fastest during the boom \u2013 to other areas where the growth came later.\u201d Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said people selling homes in the capital were having to price their properties more realistically to close deals. \u201c[The Nationwide report] shows the north-south divide in reverse and confirms what we have been seeing on the ground \u2013 that the London market is struggling for mainly affordability reasons and it is only those sellers who recognise the changed market conditions that are doing deals,\u201d he said. Nationwide\u2019s Gardner said that in the UK overall, house prices were being propped up by low mortgage rates, high employment and a shortage of properties on the market, but added that pressure on household incomes was starting to weigh on confidence. In recent weeks, Bank of England policymakers have signalled that they were nearing the point of raising interest rates for the first the time in more than a decade. Rates are at an all-time low of 0.25%, and economists believe the monetary policy committee could vote for an increase to 0.5% as early as November. Gardner said a small rise in rates would not put excessive pressure on homeowners, partly because a smaller proportion of people were on variable rate mortgages that would be most affected by a rise in interest rates. \u201cProviding the economy does not weaken further, the impact of a small rise in interest rates on UK households is likely to be modest. This is partly because the proportion of borrowers directly impacted will be smaller than in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cIn recent years, the vast majority of new mortgages have been extended on fixed interest rates. The share of outstanding mortgages on variable interest rates has fallen to its lowest level on record, at about 40%, down from a peak of 70% in 2001.\u201d In September, UK house prices edged up 0.2%, after a 0.1% dip in August. On an annual basis, prices were up 2% compared with September last year. EY Item Club said UK house price growth was likely to slow to 2.5% this year, from 4.5% in 2016 on Nationwide\u2019s measure. \u201cThe fundamentals for house buyers are likely to remain weak over the coming months with consumers\u2019 purchasing power continuing to be squeezed by inflation running higher than earnings growth,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief economist at the forecasting group. \u201cAdditionally, housing market activity is likely to be hampered by fragile consumer confidence and limited willingness to engage in major transactions.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Michael O\u2019Leary is a lucky man. As the Ryanair cancellation crisis has gone from bad to worse, despite the chief executive\u2019s insistence that it wouldn\u2019t, almost nobody is asking whether he is still the right person for the job. The question would be asked at most listed companies in Ryanair\u2019s position. The second round of cancellations will affect 18,000 flights on 34 routes between November 2017 and March 2018, which suggests the original rostering plans weren\u2019t merely wrong, but miles off target. The company has also provoked the fury of the Civil Aviation Authority, which has said Ryanair misled passengers about their legal rights. The regulator set a deadline for compliance of 5pm on Friday. And Ryanair has made a major strategic U-turn by walking away from its pursuit of the bankrupt Italian airline Alitalia. Up to a point, O\u2019Leary\u2019s protected status is understandable. He\u2019s been the CEO since 1994 and his talent for publicity is undeniable and valuable, at least it has been until now. He has a near 4% shareholding worth about \u00a3670m, so he ought to be motivated. Profit forecasts for this year are also largely intact. For all that, you\u2019d still expect a company undergoing some soul-searching \u2013 on the board, or among its shareholders \u2013 about accountability. Yet David Bonderman, the private equity veteran who chairs Ryanair, has been silent through the crisis. In normal circumstances, you might expect a chairman to be asking whether a group of non-executives that includes Ryanair\u2019s former deputy chief executive, its former chief pilot and a stockbroker who helped float the airline in 1997, is sufficiently independent. As for the City, you will struggle to find much debate over the years about whether Ryanair\u2019s lean-and-mean operating model could generate operational risks, such as a shortage of backup pilots. Ryanair is worth \u20ac20bn (\u00a317.5bn). Is it too much of a one-man show? You\u2019d hope somebody in the City or Dublin would want answers. To find sceptical voices, you have to go further afield. The US pension fund Calstrs voted against the re-election of nearly the entire board, including O\u2019Leary, at the annual meeting earlier this month, and the Dutch investor NN Investment Partners said in a recent report that it had \u201cgrowing concern about how the airline pays its staff and interacts with unions\u201d. UK and Irish fund managers, who have lapped up O\u2019Leary\u2019s charm, should give them a call. Distance lends perspective, they say. The outsiders may have useful thoughts. Will insurance be at a premium after natural disasters? A short summary of the past five years\u2019 progress in the insurance and reinsurance markets would run as follows. After a year of heavy losses in 2011, caused by floods in Thailand and Australia, the New Zealand earthquake and the Japanese tsunami, the price of buying insurance against natural catastrophes soared. In the more benign years that followed, insurers made a packet. In 2013, Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market, recorded a heady return on capital of 16.2%. In a world of low interest rates, more and more capital was attracted, putting downward pressure on premiums and provoking warnings, including from Lloyd\u2019s, that risk was being mispriced. But claims remained subdued and Lloyd\u2019s still produced returns of 9.1% in 2015 and 8.1% in 2016. That winning run for insurers is over now, of course. The horrendous run of natural disasters that have brought death and destruction is so many places is not yet reflected in Lloyd\u2019s figures, showing pre-tax profits for the first six months of 2017 down 16% to \u00a31.22bn, but the claims are now arriving. Lloyd\u2019s estimates net claims of $4.5bn from Harvey and Irma in the US and Caribbean, and it\u2019s too soon to put a cost on Maria, the Mexican earthquake and typhoons in Asia. The broker Jefferies reckons Lloyd\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 how much premium income is paid out in claims and expenses \u2013 will be 112.5% over 2017. Anything above 100% means a loss. In 2011, the figure was 106.8%. The market is perfectly able to absorb the losses, being well capitalised, but a financial question is what happens to premiums now. In theory, they should soar again. The expectation, however, is that low interest rates will continue to attract a wall of money and thus limit increases. That would be good news for those buying insurance, but it would also be evidence that low interest rates are still distorting the price of risk with unknown long-term effects. Paddy Power Betfair chief\u2019s U-turn on FOBTs is not all it seems There is joy in heaven over every sinner who repents, but the trumpets should not sound too loudly for Breon Corcoran, the soon-to-depart chief executive of Paddy Power Betfair, now that he thinks spin limits on those soulless fixed-odds betting terminals should be cut from \u00a3100 to \u00a310 or less. As irate rivals argue, there is a whiff of opportunism here: Paddy Power Betfair is far less exposed to loss of guaranteed profits from machines because it has fewer of them. Corcoran\u2019s reason for advising the government ealier this week to proceed with a cut is also nuanced. He thinks the debate around the machines has become \u201cso toxic\u201d that only a substantial reduction in stake limits will address \u201csocietal concerns\u201d, which is not the same as admitting that roulette, played in electronic form at souped-up speed, is a nasty product that can do particular harm. Still, his intervention has made it harder for the government to continue to dither over stake limits. A cut is coming, and about time, too.",

The UK\u2019s biggest payday lender was forced to tear up its business model in 2014 after running into regulatory problems and because of the cap on loan rates introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority in 2015. A new management team took over in late 2014 and said in the lender\u2019s annual report that it expected \u201cto report a significantly improved performance for the current financial year\u201d. Among the reasons listed for this was the end of its football sponsorship, which is reported to have cost \u00a324m over four years, and Wonga\u2019s efforts to cut costs, including moving its head office across London. Tara Kneafsey, the chief executive of Wonga, said that since 2014, the business \u201chad been transformed as we have expanded our product offering, strengthened our governance, rationalised our operations and reduced our cost base\u201d. She is thought to be the highest-paid director disclosed in the 2016 annual report, with yearly remuneration of \u00a3467,000. In 2014 Wonga was ordered to pay \u00a32.6m in compensation to about 45,000 customers after sending threatening letters from non-existent law firms, and was then forced to write off \u00a3220m of debts of 375,000 borrowers who it admitted should never have been given loans. The cap on payday loans means interest and fees on all high-cost, short-term loans have been capped at 0.8% per day of the amount borrowed. Before interest rates were capped, the company had come under attack for charging annual interest rates as high as 5,853% on short-term loans. Products on its website \u2013 within the cap \u2013 show that rates offered on a six-month \u00a3600 loan with six monthly repayments are the equivalent of a 1,086% annual rate, although Kneafsey said annual comparisons were not a realistic gauge of the borrowing rate. The annual report shows revenue was \u00a376.7m, up from \u00a365.2m but still well below the \u00a3300m Wonga was generating in 2012. The loss of \u00a364.9m is lower than the \u00a380m incurred in 2015, however. About 60% of the lender\u2019s revenue is generated in the UK, with the rest made in Poland, South Africa and Spain.",

      "bodyText": "The end to almost fifty years of Brussels protectionism this weekend is set to shake up Britain\u2019s sugar industry \u2013 with the potential for boom or bust for producers. But there\u2019s a sweetener for consumers, as prices are expected to fall. The European Union is abolishing its system of quotas and minimum pricing for sugar from Sunday 1 October, in one of the biggest changes for British agriculture in recent years. The UK\u2019s 3,500 growers of sugar beet \u2013 a sweet root vegetable that looks like a turnip \u2013 and the country\u2019s sole refiner, British Sugar, expect the change to allow them to increase production by 50% annually. It\u2019s an industry that supports nearly 10,000 jobs across the country, helping the UK to consume roughly 2m tonnes of sugar a year. About 60% comes from home-grown beets, while another 15% comes from the EU and the remainder is from imported cane sugar. The sugar rush comes as the EU scraps limits on production for the first time since 1968. Britain had been limited to producing little more than one million tonnes a year, which has led to stockpiling following bumper harvests. British Sugar, a part of the Associated British Foods conglomerate, plans to immediately increase production to 1.4m tonnes next year from 900,000 tonnes in 2017. Paul Kenward, the company\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cI\u2019m optimistic and our growers are too. In the past you could bang on my door and say you wanted more sugar, but I had to say no even if I could make it. Now that is changing.\u201d But with the vote to leave the European Union, higher taxes on sugary drinks and a government push to wean consumers off unhealthy treats, the industry may face a sticky future. Producers will also be more exposed to the global sugar price as protections recede. Brussels is also keeping punitive tariffs on imported cane sugar \u2013 which makes a substance chemically identical to beet \u2013 in a bitter development for one of the oldest names in the British sweetening industry, Tate &amp; Lyle Sugars. The company was one of the most vocal proponents of Brexit for just this reason. Gerald Mason, the firm\u2019s senior vice-president, said: \u201cThis [end of EU quotas] is a pretty depressing milestone for us. We\u2019re already running at a loss, and these changes will only exacerbate that.\u201d The makers of the famous Lyle\u2019s Golden Syrup at its factory in east London will continue to face EU tariffs just as the global sugar price dips ahead of the anticipated European boom in beet production. Brexit offers the potential to sidestep the EU tariffs, although it could also lead to other changes that are difficult to forecast. British beet farmers are eyeing a jump in exports as the World Trade Organisation removes limits on EU sugar in exchange for Brussels dropping its pricing and quota system. Consumers could benefit from falling prices, although not immediately, according to Callum Macpherson at the City bank Investec. \u201cIf prices are passed through to consumers, where you might see a noticeable effect, at some stage, is on the cost of buying a bag of sugar in the supermarket,\u201d he said. There could however be trouble ahead for growers, fearing a repeat of the removal of the EU milk quota system in 2015. That led to a crash in prices, which drove some British dairy farmers out of business. Prices have since recovered amid a scarcity of supply after so many producers opted to leave the industry. That has led butter prices to soar more than 20% in the past year to record levels, as farmers and dairies struggle to cope with demand, pushing up the cost of cakes, croissants and other goods on the supermarket shelves. Brussels observers estimate the European beet crop for next year to be at least 16% more substantial than the one being harvested now, although they reckon the most competitive nations are the ones that will have increased capacity most. While the UK is among one of the best in the world, the EU describes the \u201csugar belt\u201d of Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland as the most competitive. Patrick Allpress, a farmer who grows sugar beet alongside leeks, onions and wheat over 2,000 acres of land in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, said British growers may see more competition from continental rivals. \u201cNow the chains are off and the quotas are coming down, any country can do what they want,\u201d he said. Farmers could find themselves with staff shortages or higher costs as low-skilled European migrant workers leave Britain following the Brexit vote. The industry is thought to need about 90,000 seasonal workers a year by 2021, on top of the more than 250,000 permanent workers \u2013 more than three-quarters of whom now come from the EU. However, beet isn\u2019t as hard to pick as some crops and the process has already been heavily automated, which could limit the impact. The opportunity to grow without limits is enticing some farmers to plant more and some companies to invest. Dubai-based Al Khaleej International is considering a huge new factory, which would be the first to open in the UK for 90 years, close to Harrogate in Yorkshire. British Sugar \u2013 which operates four sites across east Anglia and the east Midlands \u2013 argues that Britain can export more to the EU and global markets. It estimates that beet yields have improved by more than 25% in the UK in the last 10 years. Kenward said: \u201cOn the risk side, is that my competitors in Europe have been holding back due to volume quotas. But we\u2019ve prepared for it, and can now sell to customers in the UK, EU and around the world.\u201d Across the EU, sugar production next year is now forecast at 20.1m tonnes, about 20% more than this year\u2019s crop. Imports are expected to fall to 1.5m tonnes, while exports are forecast to double to 2.8m tonnes. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe removal of EU sugar beet quotas will enable British growers compete on a level playing field with other sugar producers around the world.\u201d",
