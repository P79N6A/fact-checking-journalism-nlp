      "bodyText": "Holiday flights could be disrupted by more industrial action as 1,500 baggage handlers, check-in staff and cargo crew working at 18 airports across the UK are set to strike over the Christmas weekend. Members of the Unite union employed by Swissport, who work on behalf of airlines at airports including Stansted, Luton, Gatwick, Leeds-Bradford, Manchester, Cardiff, Belfast, Glasgow and Edinburgh, intend to walk out for 48 hours on 23 and 24 December. Cargo workers at Heathrow could also take action. Birmingham, Southampton and Newcastle airports, whose check-in and baggage handling are entirely operated by Swissport, could be among the worst affected. Talks to avert the strike could still take place, as Unite called on Swissport\u2019s management to go to negotiations at Acas to stave off the Christmas travel disruption. Unite members voted by 62.5% to reject a three-year pay deal. The unionsaid the offered barely keeps pace with inflation, while eroding terms and conditions, including freezing overtime payments. Oliver Richardson, Unite\u2019s national officer for civil air transport, said members were taking action as a last resort. He said: \u201cWe appreciate that this is a very busy time of year at the UK\u2019s airports and that\u2019s why we are calling for the company to engage in constructive talks under the auspices of Acas to resolve this dispute.\u201d Unite has Swissport members at Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Bournemouth, Cardiff, Doncaster, East Midlands, Edinburgh, Gatwick, Glasgow, Heathrow, Leeds-Bradford, Luton, Manchester, Newcastle, Southampton and Stansted. Airports said they would have plans in place to minimise any effect to passengers\u2019 journeys. A Newcastle airport spokesperson said: \u201cWe hope that the matter is resolved in the near future but, if the action goes ahead, then we have plans in place to minimise any disruption.\u201d A spokesman for MAG, which owns airports including Manchester and Stansted, said: \u201cWe are aware of this potential action and are contacting the airlines which use Swissport to understand their contingency plans to minimise any disruption were the strikes to go ahead.\u201d At Gatwick, Swissport only handles flights for Virgin Atlantic, whose passengers could potentially be affected by a parallel dispute involving the airline\u2019s pilots. The pilots have voted to take industrial action short of a strike in a row over union recognition, with an overtime ban starting on 23 December. Their union, the PPU, said the action would see a removal of \u201cpilot goodwill\u201d, with members working strictly to their contract. It said: \u201cIt is possible that this may leave some flights not covered for the duration of any action, which has the potential to continue indefinitely.\u201d The PPU, formed entirely of Virgin Atlantic pilots, was launched three years ago as a breakaway from the TUC-affiliated British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa). Air passengers could also be affected by a potential strike by British Airways cabin crew. More than 2,500 members of the airline\u2019s mixed fleet at Heathrow voted to strike over pay, but have yet to give formal notice of industrial action.",

      "bodyText": "Strikes by Southern train drivers have caused the cancellation of all services on the network for a third day, and the company warned of further severe disruption to come next week when conductors walk out. About 300,000 passengers were left without their usual service as Southern cancelled all of its 2,242 weekday services on Friday. An ongoing overtime ban by drivers in the Aslef union will compound the effects of a two-day strike by RMT conductors starting on Monday. Prospects for an imminent resolution of the long-running dispute appear remote after talks between Aslef and Southern\u2019s parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway, collapsed on Thursday. GTR said it had put a \u201cpractical offer\u201d to the union for consideration to end the industrial action, but Aslef denied this. Its general secretary, Mick Whelan, wrote to members on Friday saying: \u201dI regret to advise that at no time during the course of discussions did the company make any kind of formal offer in relation to the substantive issues at the heart of the dispute.\u201d He added: \u201cAslef remains committed to finding a negotiated settlement as we have already done with ScotRail.\u201d GTR said the public would be \u201csimply perplexed\u201d. Its chief operating officer, Nick Brown, said: \u201cWe\u2019re sincerely sorry that commuters\u2019 work and family lives are being punished with this unjustified and unprecedented industrial action. The unions must stop the pain and suffering blighting passengers and commerce.\u201d The dispute has become focused on a move to driver-only operation of trains, which unions say has safety risks and could downgrade the number or quality of jobs in rail. On Thursday night, a group of commuters marched in protest from Southern\u2019s main London hub, Victoria station, to the Department for Transport to hand in a letter demanding action. A spokesman for the Association of British Commuters said: \u201cWe have suffered a year-long nightmare because of the collapse of Southern rail. We have desperately called for government action and have been repeatedly ignored, even while many of us have lost our jobs or had to move house.\u201d Katy Davies, one of the organisers of the march, who commutes from south London, said: \u201cThis is not just about the financial impact of paying for a service that doesn\u2019t work, but quality of life: people who are losing jobs, patients missing treatment, families who have to arrange emergency childcare, people thrown off trains that aren\u2019t going anywhere late at night.\u201d She said Southern services had been unreliable every day, not just during the strikes, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re at breaking point and want answers from Chris Grayling [the transport secretary]. If he fails to act, we\u2019d call for his resignation.\u201d Data released by Network Rail shows that parts of the Southern network recorded their worst punctuality figures in years last month. Just 67.9% of its metropolitan services, operating in Greater London, arrived at their destination within five minutes of the scheduled time in the four weeks to 10 December \u2013 the poorest performance for that part of the route in publicly available records dating back to April 2010. More strikes are planned over the new year period by conductors, while drivers plan a six-day walkout from 9 January, which would be the worst continuous disruption for decades. National Express, which provided more than 3,000 extra seats on coach services in areas affected by the strike, said it had its busiest day ever recorded for coach travel on the London to Brighton route. Meanwhile, season ticket holders on ScotRail, who have also suffered a year of disruption, will get a free week of travel paid for by the Scottish government. The compensation, worth \u00a33m, comes after the franchise run by the Dutch firm Abellio has faced heavy criticism for late and cancelled trains.",

      "bodyText": "American drillers added oil rigs for the seventh week in a row last week. The Baker Hughes rig survey showed 12 oil rigs and one gas were added, as the crude price recovery encouraged further drilling activity. Oil rigs have been added in 26 of the past 29 weeks. So far the rig news has had little impact on the oil price, with Brent crude still up around 1.7% at $54.95 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Despite US markets coming off their best levels - perhaps following a report China seized an underwater US drone in the South China Sea - European shares have ended the week on a fairly positive note. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 12.63 points or 0.18% to 7011.64, the first time it has closed above 7000 since 25 October Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.33% to 11,404.01 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.29% to 4833.27 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.11% to 19,014.75 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.77% to 9412.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 4.22% to 639.64 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 27 points at 19879 having earlier reached 19,923. Meanwhile the pound is up 0.46% to $1.2471 but is still trading close to a three week low after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and thus boosted the US currency. More on S&amp;P maintaining its Triple A rating on Germany. The agency said: We think Germany\u2019s highly diversified and competitive economy will continue to sustain its current growth momentum, backed by strong domestic demand and resilient exports against an increasingly challenging international backdrop. Germany\u2019s surpluses on its external and fiscal balance sheet will enable the country to weather external shocks, while ultralow interest rates and strong tax revenue growth continue to benefit its public-sector balance sheet. We are affirming our \u2018AAA\u2019 long-term and \u2018A-1+\u2019 short-term sovereign credit ratings on Germany. The stable outlook reflects our view that over the next two years Germany\u2019s public finances and strong external balance sheet will continue to withstand potential financial and economic shocks. Markets remain in positive territory, although they are off their best levels. But the recent rally could continue next week, analysts believe. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The week ends with gains across the board, although the Dow Jones remains tantalisingly short of the 20,000 target. Still, a good performance from the Russell 2000 this afternoon bodes well for the week ahead. Santa definitely arrived early this year, but perhaps we\u2019ll get another rally next week. The FTSE seems happy enough to move above 7000, and it is entirely plausible that the index will touch new all-time highs before everyone sets off for Christmas. It will just require a little sprinkling of festive spirit, and hopefully a good performance from miners, which have been a little under pressure since the Fed announced its plan to raise rates three times next year. The coming week is not exactly busy, as might be expected, but one area of interest will be the Bank of Japan. The yen has taken a hammering since the election, which has done wonders for the Japanese stock market, but we should not rule out a statement that gives the currency a breathing space. Everyone seems to be long the US dollar, so it wouldn\u2019t take much of a change to spark some interesting moves in the week ahead. Oil is moving higher on hopes that producers will stick to their deal to cut output. Ahead of the latest Baker Hughes survey of US rigs, Brent crude has climbed 1.7% to $54.94 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate is up 1.57% to $51.70 as Russia said all of its oil companies had agreed to reduce output. Back with Greece, and ahead of the Merkel-Tsipras meeting, the German finance ministry has said an assessment report on Tsipras\u2019 surprise relief package is not going to make for rosy reading, reports Helena Smith: Athens\u2019 lender institutions have assembled a report into whether the Greek prime minister\u2019s unilateral measures violate his country\u2019s bailout obligations and while preliminary \u201cit is quite critical,\u201d a German finance ministry announced today. The report, requested by Berlin, will be evaluated in full next week. Particular focus will be paid to Tsipras\u2019 surprise bonanza for low-income pensioners in the form of a pre-Christmas bonus, in effect a 13th payment. Germany\u2019s hardline stance \u2013 at least from it\u2019s uncompromising finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble - has triggered mounting speculation that the politician is now bent on ousting the leftist leader and replacing him with the head of the main opposition centre right New Democracy party, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. \u201cIt is obvious that [he] wants to overturn the government and replace it with one that has New Democracy at its core,\u201d said Stelios Kouloglou, a Euro MP representing Greece\u2019s governing Syriza party. \u201cAfter [French president] Hollande \u2026 and [Italian PM] Renzi he wants to be done with whatever trace of the left has remained in Europe.\u201d US markets are heading higher as the expectation of stimulus measures from the new President continues to provide support. The three main indices are on track for weekly rises and are all near record highs, even as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and hinted at three more to come in 2017. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently up 42 points at 19,894, is close to breaching the 20,000 barrier for the first time. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.26% higher. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The big question on most people\u2019s lips at the moment is whether the Dow can manage to nibble away at the 20,000 level that it has been flirting with this week. Thus far it has fallen short and the likelihood is that the opportunity to do it this week has passed. Even if we fall short we\u2019ve still seen a decent week for US equities, trading as they continue to do at record levels. The big question is how a strong US dollar and a strong US equity market can co-exist at a time when all we have had at the moment is promises of fiscal action, and higher rates. Since the 8th November the Dow has rallied 9%, the S&amp;P 00 over 6% and the Russell 2000 has gained over 14%; how much of market expectations of what President elect Trump can deliver are now priced in? The typical UK household spends more than \u00a32,000 a month, but in December - in the run-up to Christmas - it spends an extra \u00a3500, according to the Bank of England. And the biggest increase is not, as you might expect, on alcohol but on books, the Bank says. And over the past three years, the value of online shopping has doubled, and now accounts for \u00a31 in every \u00a38 spent. US housing starts fell by more than expected in November, falling from a nine year high. They dropped 18.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09m units, below expectations of a figure of 1.23m. October\u2019s number was revised up from 1.32m to 1.34m, the highest since July 2007. More on Greece, and some comments from Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and German chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of their talks. Tsipras has said he would tell the chancellor about the positive momentum in the Greek economy and the \u201cspectacular overachievement of revenue targets.\u201d Meanwhile, another possible hurdle for Greece to overcome: European markets are at 11-month highs, partly on the back of a weaker euro and expectations for stronger growth in the US next year. Reuters quotes Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets: Stocks are continuing to get a boost from a weaker euro and the notion that the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, will experience an uptick in growth once President-elect Donald Trump has started implementing his new policies. Europe\u2019s main markets are up across the board: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,019 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.6% at 11,437 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 4,850 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 19,064 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 9,377 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 360 Greece\u2019s central bank has appealed for an end to the standoff between the government and the country\u2019s creditors. If follows the decision by prime minister Alexis Tsipras to award low income pensioners with a pre-Christmas bonus - a move which angered Greece\u2019s international lenders. The Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith reports from Athens: Hours after the Greek parliament approved Tsipras\u2019 package of relief measures, the country\u2019s central bank has stepped in, urging an end to the dispute and appealing for differences to be \u201cworked out at the negotiations table in a genuine spirit of co-operation with the institutions and our partners.\u201d Predicting the economy will expand by 2.5% next year \u2013 a jump from just 0.1 % this year - the Bank of Greece called for \u201cpragmatism and flexibility\u201d in its interim monetary policy report released today. This emerging positive momentum in the economy needs to be supported and consolidated through adherence to the programme targets and an accelerated implementation of the reforms and privatisations agreed on. Specifically, the Bank of Greece expects GDP to grow by a marginal 0.1% in 2016, before picking up to 2.5 % in 2017 and further to 3% in 2018 and 2019, supported by investment, consumption and exports. But an ongoing review of the debt-stricken country\u2019s creditor-mandated reforms would have to be wrapped up quickly, the bank said, so that Greece could take the next step towards inclusion in the European Central Bank\u2019s QE bond-buying programme. There is not much time left, in the light of upcoming national elections in a number of euro area countries. Progress, it added, would be easier if lenders also agreed to lower expectations of Athens achieving a primary budget surplus of 3.5 % by 2018. Tsipras is expected to raise this issue \u2013 and the decision by the euro zone\u2019s bailout agency, or ESM, to put short-term debt relief measures for Athens on hold - when he holds talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin this evening. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the CBI surveys suggests the weaker official manufacturing data for October will prove to be a blip. [It] suggests that the 1% monthly fall in manufacturing output in October, as revealed by the ONS figures earlier this month, was just a temporary blip. Accordingly, we continue to think that GDP growth will become better balanced over the coming quarters. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says 2017 could be a tougher year for manufacturers. Despite the decent December CBI industrial trends survey, there are significant potential problems for the manufacturing sector that look likely to build up in 2017. In particular, business confidence is likely to be hampered by mounting uncertainty over the Brexit process, constraining investment plans and limiting demand for capital goods. It also looks inevitable that consumers will become markedly less able (due to diminishing purchasing power) and likely more reluctant to buy big ticket consumer durable items over the coming months. While output and orders were up, the CBI survey also suggested the sharp fall in the drop of the pound since the Brexit vote is starting to push up manufacturers\u2019 costs. A weaker pound makes imports from abroad more expensive, and the CBI said factory gate inflation is heading higher as manufacturers pass on to customers some of the price increases they are facing. Expectations for output price inflation - the prices charged by manufacturers for their goods - in the three months to March rose to their highest level since June 2011. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, says: It\u2019s good to see our manufacturers ending the year on a high note with growth in production the strongest since summer 2014 and total orders still robust. But the weakness of sterling is pushing up the cost of imports, and our survey shows strong signs of this feeding through to higher factory gate prices. After a challenging 2016, UK manufacturers will want to build on the positive momentum going into the new year, with the Government\u2019s recent commitments on a modern industrial strategy and innovation investment a welcome tonic.\u201d The CBI\u2019s industrial trends survey paints a better than expected picture of the UK manufacturing sector in December. The orders balance was 0, as 21% of businesses reported orders were above normal and 21% said they were below. That was better than the -5% predicted by economists, and the highest level in 20 months. Growth in output was the strongest since mid-2014, the business lobby groups said. Production fell in just four out of 18 sectors. Teva Group, parent company of Actavis, has responded to criticism from the competition watchdog over steep price hikes. The Competition and Markets Authority says the UK-based Actavis company increased the price of life-saving hydrocortisone tablets by over 12,000% (full story here). Teva responds: Generic medicines continue to be an affordable alternative to branded therapies. Teva is proud of our track record in bringing cost savings to the NHS as the UK\u2019s largest generic medicines manufacturer. Competition from generic medicines saves the NHS in England and Wales \u00a313.5bn per year overall, and Teva medicines account for approximately \u00a33.2bn of this saving. Although the pricing of the acquired Actavis product (Hydrocortisone) under investigation was never under Teva\u2019s effective control, Teva believes that intervention by the CMA in prices for generic medicines raises serious policy concerns regarding the roles of both the CMA and the Department of Health. The annual rate of inflation climbed to a 31-month high of 0.6% in November from 0.5% in October, the Eurostat statistics office has confirmed. The biggest drivers of the rise came from restaurants and cafes, rents and tobacco, while the price of gas, heating oil and package holidays fell and held the inflation rate back. Olivier Vigna, economist at HSBC, said the French Insee survey was the latest indication that growth in the fourth quarter will pick-up to 0.4% from 0.2% in the third. Recent surveys on France largely confirm the rebound in the economic activity we expect for Q4 and other forward-looking indicators also point to a higher momentum. Of course, it would be naive to read too much into the positive signals coming from surveys as they are not always reflected in hard data. Nevertheless, the upwards trend witnessed in surveys bodes well for the increase we anticipate for GDP over the last quarter of 2016: we forecast +0.4% q-o-q after two consecutive weak quarters (-0.1% in Q2, then +0.2% in Q3). So although it is too early to have a comprehensive view on the full set of Q4 data, such an encouraging move, if durable and converted into better hard data, would also be positive for the entry into 2017. Over in France, firms were feeling more confident than expected in December according to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee). The headline index rose to 105 from 102. It was the highest level since the summer of 2011. Confidence grew among manufacturing, services and retail firms, but dipped in construction. Insee: After being almost stable since August 2015, equal or slightly above its long term average (100), the climate has improved markedly in December 2016. Germany\u2019s economy will be stronger than expected in the fourth quarter according to the Munich-based Ifo Institute. Positive growth momentum in Europe\u2019s largest economy will be carried into 2017, it added. As Ifo issued updated forecasts, the institute\u2019s president Clemens Fuest, commented: All signs point to a fourth quarter that is stronger than had been expected until now. We\u2019ll take this impetus into the new year. Ifo left its forecast for growth in 2016 unchanged at 1.9%, which would be the strongest in five years. It nudged up forecasts for both 2017 and 2018 by 0.1% percentage points to 1.5% and 1.7% respectively. Fuest: The change of growth pace from 2016 to 2017 is only due to a lower number of workdays. For context, here are the International Monetary Fund\u2019s growth predictions for the G7 in 2017 : US: 2.2% Germany: 1.4% France: 1.3% Italy: 0.9% Japan: 0.6% UK: 1.1% Canada: 1.9% The UK\u2019s Actavis is the latest pharmaceutical company to come under criticism from the competition regulator over sharply hiking the price of tablets. Specifically, the Competition and Markets Authority says Actavis increased the price of life-saving hydrocortisone tablets by over 12,000%. It pushed up the annual cost to the NHS from \u00a3522,000 before to 2008 to \u00a370m by 2015. The tablets are used by people whose adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones, such as those suffering from Addison\u2019s disease. At the this stage, the CMA\u2019s findings are provisional and no fine has been issued. It follows the watchdog\u2019s decision last week to impose a record \u00a384.2m fine on Pfizer, after the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug was increased by up to 2,600%. Read our full story on Actavis here: The FTSE 100 is up five points in early trading. So it\u2019s a modest gain but takes the UK\u2019s leading index of shares back above the 7,000 mark at 7,002. Following the excitement of the Fed rate rise and Bank of England policy meeting earlier in the week, markets across Europe are fairly steady. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,004 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.02% at 11,368 French CAC: -0.1% at 4,815 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 19,033 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,319 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.03% at 359 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Close attention will be paid to the CBI\u2019s December industrial trends survey at 11am today as it will provide a timely health check on the UK economy as 2016 draws to a close. Business surveys capture a more recent picture of economic activity than official data, but rely on a smaller sample size and tend to be more anecdotal. That said, economists and policymakers look to surveys for clues of where the official data might be heading. The CBI\u2019s manufacturing survey is expected to show a balance of -5% of firms reported a rise in orders in December, worse than November when it was -3%. One of the issues in recent weeks however is that the official data has painted a weaker picture of the economy than business surveys. Adam Cole, currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, says: Today\u2019s CBI manufacturing survey is worth watching in the light of the very weak October manufacturing output data which marked a poor start to the monthly indicators that will add up to Q4 GDP. The CBI survey has been less volatile than the manufacturing PMI recently and the consensus for the orders balance (-5) would be consistent with manufacturing out trending no better than flat. We will bring you the numbers and reaction as it comes in, as well as tracking all the main events through the day.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Drugs companies are facing renewed questions about the prices they charge the NHS for life-saving medicines after a firm was accused of marking up a tablet by more than 12,000%. A week after US giant Pfizer was slapped with a record fine of \u00a384.2m for alleged unfair price hikes, the Competition and Markets Authority accused another multinational, Actavis, of ramping up prices for life-saving hydrocortisone tablets from 70p a pack as of April 2008 to \u00a388 by March 2016. The treatment is prescribed to people whose adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones, such as those suffering from Addison\u2019s disease. Almost 1m prescriptions were distributed over the last year. The regulator\u2019s senior responsible officer, Andrew Groves, said the price increase was unfair because it is the only available drug on the market. \u201cThis is a lifesaving drug relied on by thousands of patients, which the NHS has no choice but to continue purchasing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe allege that the company has taken advantage of this situation and the removal of the drug from price regulation, leaving the NHS \u2013 and ultimately the taxpayer \u2013 footing the bill for the substantial price rises,.\u201d Both cases, as well as a previous investigation involving GSK, are currently being challenged by the drugs firms, but a spokesperson for the CMA said three further investigations are under way into the pharmaceutical sector, one of which is looking at another case of unfair pricing. But, he said, without conducting a sector-wide investigation of the pricing of generic drugs it was difficult to assess the extent of the problem. \u201cThere is legislation [being planned] to keep a closer eye on generics and that was partly [as a] result of some of the concerns that have come up from things we have been investigating,\u201d he added. Drug companies face price controls for as long as their products are protected by patents. As soon as patents expire, drugs go \u201coff-brand\u201d meaning any rivals can develop generic copies. Normally this reduces costs as other players enter the market. But in these two cases, the lack of substitute products proved costly for the NHS, according to the regulator. The Pfizer case resulted in the NHS paying about \u00a350m a year extra for its epilepsy medicine over the past four years, according to the CMA, while the Actavis increase cost about \u00a370m extra annually. With other cases pending, it is possible that the cash-strapped NHS has been overcharged several hundreds of millions of pounds altogether over the past few years. Hydrocortisone tablets went off-brand of 2008. But according to the CMA, Actavis remained the only supplier until last year. Observers say there could be a number of reasons why. \u201cIt is typically a mix of scientific and regulatory and commercial factors that will impact on a decision whether to develop a generic or not,\u201d said Warwick Smith, director general of the British Generic Manufacturers Association (BGMA). He added that if a drug is complicated to make, or there are only a small number of patients taking the medication, companies may chose not to produce the drug. If upheld, the Pfizer and Actavis cases would clearly show that the market for medicines falls down where the NHS has no alternatives for life-saving treatments. A spokesperson for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, the trade body for major pharmaceutical companies condemned such practices saying: \u201cThe ABPI has repeatedly said that it does not in any way support or condone the practice of \u2018price hikes\u2019 to generic medicines. This position has not changed.\u201d Actavis was bought by the Israeli pharmaceutical company Teva earlier this year but it is now in the process of selling off the operation to Intas Pharmaceuticals to comply with EU rules. Tevas said it intended to defend the allegations although it said the pricing of the hydrocortisone product had never been under its control.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Poundland\u2019s advertising once trumpeted \u201cYes! Everything\u2019s \u00a31!\u201d but that pledge could be ditched as the bargain chain\u2019s new owners move into clothing sales. Andy Bond, the former Asda boss who now heads Poundland as the boss of Pepkor Europe, an arm of South African group Steinhoff International, which bought the retailer for \u00a3610m in September, said he wanted to introduce the group\u2019s Pep &amp; Co clothing to every store \u2013 and it would not all be priced at \u00a31. Full 2,500 sq ft Pep &amp; Co outlets will go into 10 Poundland stores from next February and Bond said there was room for them in at least 50 of Poundland\u2019s 900 outlets. Smaller stores will feature a few racks of clothing, focusing on kids and womenswear. \u201cThe relationship between Pep &amp; Co and Poundland will become increasingly significant. My ambition is that, over time, Pep &amp; Co will become to Poundland like George is to Asda,\u201d said Bond. The model follows that of GHM!, the six-store budget retail chain launched by Bond in the summer which will now be folded into Poundland. Bond said no decision had been made on what would happen to the pricing of Poundland\u2019s other products but he admitted that experiments were taking place. For more than a year, the chain has been occasionally discounting items to 90p or 80p or pushing bigger items for \u00a38 or more. Bond said: \u201cWe will always anchor Poundland around the trust of \u00a31 pricing but the research from the business isn\u2019t that people shop there because things are \u00a31 but because they get amazing value. There are some areas where sticking to \u00a31 doesn\u2019t let you have a credible offer - like toys and clothing.\u201d Bond said trying out a range of prices was something all single price retailers in the UK were looking at. \u201cThe journey pound stores are going on is the same as the dollar stores in the US,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast majority of them have moved from single price to multi-price - from one price to a small number of prices.\u201d The fall in the value of the pound against the dollar, the currency in which much of the non-food goods sold in Poundland are bought in from the far east, is only likely to add to the pressure for change. Single price retailers have less options to cope with inflation. In the past, it has meant \u201cshrinkflation\u201d \u2013 reducing the size of packs so that they can still meet the \u00a31 target, but that has attracted criticism from consumer groups. Bond said: \u201cI\u2019d be foolish to say that we don\u2019t shrink products on occasion as we clearly do but there are other solutions \u2013 like moving to own label versions or just pushing back on suppliers.\u201d He said Poundland could choose to stop selling items which it did not think were good value and said predictions of inflation in the price of clothing, food and other goods next year was \u201dslightly hypothesising\u201d. Bond said Poundland had taken out insurance against its exposure to the dollar well into next year and there were factors at work in the global economy that may help to offset the 15% fall in the value of the pound since June. \u201cThe Chinese currency has moved so you can negotiate better cost prices in China while Chinese industry is not having the best of times so there is extra capacity and that can also make things easier,\u201d Bond said. \u201cIt is not obviously true that we are going to see retail inflation in goods denominated in dollars.\u201d Regardless of the inflation threat, Poundland has been experiencing difficulties recently. Pretax profits crashed nearly 84% to \u00a35.9m in the year to 27 March and like-for-like sales dropped 3.9% as Poundland suffered from indigestion after swallowing rival 99p Stores \u2013 a takeover that took more than a year to complete partly because of the intervention of the competition watchdog. Competition from the major supermarkets also increased as they cut prices to become more competitive with the likes of Poundland and grocery discounters Aldi and Lidl. Bond said Poundland\u2019s performance had now improved and he was optimistic about the prospects for the Christmas trading period. He admitted the market was tough but said Poundland would benefit from getting back to basics after bedding down the former 99p Stores. \u201cPoundland used to be famous for the rate it brought new items to the market. What you\u2019ll find over the next 12 months is more getting back to what the business does really well \u2013 great value and interesting new low-price items. We will be more innovative and fleet of foot,\u201d he said.",

Smaller stores will feature a few racks of clothing, focusing on kids and womenswear.</p> <p>\u201cThe relationship between Pep &amp; Co and Poundland will become increasingly significant. My ambition is that, over time, Pep &amp; Co will become to Poundland like George is to Asda,\u201d said Bond. </p> <p>The model follows that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/05/former-asda-boss-backs-new-guess-how-much-discount-store\">GHM!, the six-store budget retail</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/05/former-asda-boss-backs-new-guess-how-much-discount-store\">chain launched by Bond in the summer</a> which will now be folded into Poundland.</p> <p>Bond said no decision had been made on what would happen to the pricing of Poundland\u2019s other products but he admitted that experiments were taking place. For more than a year, the chain has been occasionally discounting items to 90p or 80p or pushing bigger items for \u00a38 or more.</p> <p>Bond said: \u201cWe will always anchor Poundland around the trust of \u00a31 pricing but the research from the business isn\u2019t that people shop there because things are \u00a31 but because they get amazing value. There are some areas where sticking to \u00a31 doesn\u2019t let you have a credible offer - like toys and clothing.\u201d</p> <p>Bond said trying out a range of prices was something all single price retailers in the UK were looking at. \u201cThe journey pound stores are going on is the same as the dollar stores in the US,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast majority of them have moved from single price to multi-price - from one price to a small number of prices.\u201d</p> <p>The fall in the value of the pound against the dollar, the currency in which much of the non-food goods sold in Poundland are bought in from the far east, is only likely to add to the pressure for change.</p> <p>Single price retailers have less options to cope with inflation. In the past, it has meant \u201cshrinkflation\u201d \u2013 reducing the size of packs so that they can still meet the \u00a31 target, but that has attracted criticism from consumer groups.</p> <p>Bond said: \u201cI\u2019d be foolish to say that we don\u2019t shrink products on occasion as we clearly do but there are other solutions \u2013 like moving to own label versions or just pushing back on suppliers.\u201d </p> <p>He said Poundland could choose to stop selling items which it did not think were good value and said predictions of inflation in the price of clothing, food and other goods next year was \u201dslightly hypothesising\u201d. </p> <p>Bond said Poundland had taken out insurance against its exposure to the dollar well into next year and there were factors at work in the global economy that may help to offset the 15% fall in the value of the pound since June. </p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese currency has moved so you can negotiate better cost prices in China while Chinese industry is not having the best of times so there is extra capacity and that can also make things easier,\u201d Bond said. \u201cIt is not obviously true that we are going to see retail inflation in goods denominated in dollars.\u201d</p> <p>Regardless of the inflation threat, Poundland has been experiencing difficulties recently. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/16/poundland-profits-crash-as-99p-stores-buyout-takes-its-toll\">Pretax profits crashed nearly 84% to \u00a35.9m in the year to 27 March</a> and like-for-like sales dropped 3.9% as Poundland suffered from indigestion after swallowing rival 99p Stores \u2013 a takeover that took more than a year to complete partly because of the intervention of the competition watchdog. </p> <p>Competition from the major supermarkets also increased as they cut prices to become more competitive with the likes of Poundland and grocery discounters Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Bond said Poundland\u2019s performance had now improved and he was optimistic about the prospects for the Christmas trading period. He admitted the market was tough but said Poundland would benefit from getting back to basics after bedding down the former 99p Stores.</p> <p>\u201cPoundland used to be famous for the rate it brought new items to the market. What you\u2019ll find over the next 12 months is more getting back to what the business does really well \u2013 great value and interesting new low-price items. We will be more innovative and fleet of foot,\u201d he said. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The Pensions Regulator (TPR) has fired a warning shot at Sir Philip Green by agreeing its biggest ever settlement with a private company in a case with similarities to BHS. Coats Group, one of the biggest manufacturers of sewing threads in the world, has agreed to pay more than \u00a3255m into its pension scheme after the regulator started legal proceedings against it. John Ralfe, a pensions consultant, said Green should feel \u201cvery, very uncomfortable\u201d about the deal. \u201cThis is the most important settlement the Pensions Regulator has ever reached,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all other warning notices [of legal proceedings], the company is already bust, so the regulator has been picking over the carcass in the bankruptcy courts. \u201cThere are clear parallels with BHS \u2013 the parent company has no legal obligation for the subsidiary\u2019s pension scheme and there is no obvious breach of rules, but the regulator has been tough and got a large contribution from the parent.\u201d The regulator has started legal proceedings against Green and Dominic Chappell, the former owners of BHS, in an attempt to fill the \u00a3571m deficit in the retailer\u2019s pension scheme. Last month, it issued warning notices to Green, Chappell and their companies outlining why they are liable to make financial contributions to the pension scheme. TPR is understood to be seeking about \u00a3350m from Green. Six months ago, the billionaire tycoon promised to MPs that he would \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme, but a deal is yet to be agreed. Frank Field, the Labour MP and co-chairman of the parliamentary committee that investigated the demise of BHS, said: \u201cWhat a fantastic Christmas gift it would be to the 20,000 pensioners counting on Sir Philip if he were to keep that promise now.\u201d It also emerged on Friday that Green is working on plans to open as many as 80 Topshop stores across China. Green owns Topshop alongside the US private equity firm Leonard Green. TPR\u2019s previous largest settlement was a \u00a3184m lump sum payment it won for the Lehman Brothers pension scheme after the collapse of the investment bank. The pension schemes connected to Coats have a combined estimated deficit of \u00a3565m. The regulator issued warning notices to Coats in 2013. The dispute centred on the company\u2019s plan to hand the bulk of the \u00a3700m it raised from the sale of assets and businesses to shareholders rather than the struggling pension schemes. The settlement between Coats and TPR shows it could take years for the BHS saga to be resolved but also that the regulator is prepared to continue negotiations with a company about a deal even after starting legal proceedings. Nicola Parish, the executive director of frontline regulation at TPR, said: \u201cThis is a substantial settlement of our case where neither the employers nor the targets were insolvent. It shows we can and will use our existing powers against a solvent employer if that is the right thing to do. \u201cThis case is a great example of how, even after warning notices have been served, TPR, the company and the trustees can work together to achieve a good outcome for members without the need to formally enforce our powers through the determinations panel. \u201cWe will continue to take a commercially minded and pragmatic approach when pursuing the use of our powers to achieve good outcomes for scheme members. \u201cIn this case, the settlement will substantially improve the funding of the two schemes and also strengthen the employer covenant supporting those schemes.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Broadcasters opposed to 21st Century Fox\u2019s proposed \u00a311.7bn takeover of Sky are preparing to lodge complaints with regulators in the UK and Europe after expressing concerns that the pay-TV broadcaster will dominate bidding for top-flight sport, TV shows and movies. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox, which owns Fox News and a Hollywood studio, made a formal bid to take full control of Sky, owner of Sky News and pay-TV operations in the UK, Germany, Austria and Italy, on Thursday. In the past year Sky, which is 39% controlled by Fox, has started to flex its muscle as a pan-European broadcaster. It has signed its first exclusive continent-wide deals with US networks HBO and Showtime, and the film-making arm of Sony, for content that includes Westworld, The Young Pope, Game of Thrones, Billions, Twin Peaks and Ghostbusters. Broadcasters in the UK, Germany, Austria and Italy are concerned that they will be locked out of future rights competitions by such blanket deals. One concern among broadcasting rivals is that Fox could enable Sky, which has found its resources stretched with the costly rollout of its advanced Sky Q box and an upcoming launch into mobile, to dominate in bidding for sports, film and drama rights. \u201cWhen you effectively have one shareholder [Fox] you have the freedom to be more long term, more ballsy,\u201d said the chief executive of a broadcaster that competes with Sky for rights deals. \u201cIn the case of Sky it could mean it will never again lose out to BT on sports rights. Essentially, if you have Murdoch in the background saying \u2018do whatever it takes, don\u2019t lose those rights \u2013 they are integral to the business\u2019, that is much simpler than having to propel and justify multibillion-pound bids with large numbers of shareholders.\u201d Fox believes there will be no competition hurdles and is buoyed by the precedent set in 2010, when the European commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive arm \u2013 cleared a bid for Sky by Fox\u2019s predecessor, News Corporation, although the phone-hacking scandal ultimately derailed the transaction. Fox is also encouraged by the green light from Brussels for Sky\u2019s takeover of its sister operations in Germany and Italy in 2014. Rivals disagree, however, arguing that the Fox/Sky combination needs to be given tough scrutiny regardless of favourable decisions in recent years. They are expected to lodge their concerns with Brussels and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK. \u201cCompared to six years ago this is a very different environment,\u201d said a second top executive at a major TV group. \u201cThe 2010 bid was about [Murdoch buying Sky in the] UK and Ireland. This is multi-market and there are issues of [pay TV viewing] share and dominance.\u201d In the UK, there is the possibility that the media regulator, Ofcom, could be asked to conduct a public interest test. This would determine whether a successful bid would give Murdoch too much control of UK news media. As well as bringing together Fox News and Sky News under the same ownership, the takeover would see Sky being fully controlled by a media tycoon who also owns the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun newspapers through a separate group, News Corp. Once Fox notifies authorities about the formal bid, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, will have 10 working days to decide whether to trigger the Ofcom test. A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said it had not yet received notification from Fox or Sky about the offer, so Bradley\u2019s quasi-judicial process is yet to start. In 2010, Murdoch was forced to table a plan to spin off Sky News to satisfy media plurality issues raised by Ofcom, a deal that was accepted by the government. Fox believes the industry landscape has changed so much in the past six years that media plurality issues will not be a concern this time and it is not planning to sacrifice Sky News. If a public interest test takes place, Sky is expected to point to factors including the decline in newspaper sales and rise in the plurality of news provision through players including Facebook, Google, Vice, BuzzFeed, Mashable and the Huffington Post. \u201cWe do think that this [deal] passes regulatory muster,\u201d said James Murdoch, chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, as he announced the formal offer this week. \u201cWe think as the relevant authorities look at the fact set around both the competition and potential UK intervention issues that no meaningful concessions will need to be made.\u201d",

Fox is also encouraged by the green light from Brussels for Sky\u2019s takeover of its sister operations in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-1004_en.htm\">Germany and Italy in 2014</a>.</p> <p>Rivals disagree, however, arguing that the Fox/Sky combination needs to be given tough scrutiny regardless of favourable decisions in recent years. They are expected to lodge their concerns with Brussels and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cCompared to six years ago this is a very different environment,\u201d said a second top executive at a major TV group. \u201cThe 2010 bid was about [Murdoch buying Sky in the] UK and Ireland. This is multi-market and there are issues of [pay TV viewing] share and dominance.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In the UK, there is the possibility that the media regulator, Ofcom, could be asked to conduct a public interest test. This would determine whether a successful bid would give Murdoch too much control of UK news media. As well as bringing together Fox News and Sky News under the same ownership, the takeover would see Sky being fully controlled by a media tycoon who also owns the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun newspapers through a separate group, News Corp.</p> <p>Once Fox notifies authorities about the formal bid, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, will have 10 working days to decide whether to trigger the Ofcom test. A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said it had not yet received notification from Fox or Sky about the offer, so Bradley\u2019s quasi-judicial process is yet to start.</p> <p>In 2010, Murdoch was forced to table a plan to spin off Sky News to satisfy media plurality issues raised by Ofcom, a deal that was accepted by the government. Fox believes the industry landscape has changed so much in the past six years that media plurality issues will not be a concern this time and it is not planning to sacrifice Sky News.</p> <p>If a public interest test takes place, Sky is expected to point to factors including the decline in newspaper sales and rise in the plurality of news provision through players including Facebook, Google, Vice, BuzzFeed, Mashable and the Huffington Post.</p> <p>\u201cWe do think that this [deal] passes regulatory muster,\u201d said James Murdoch, chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, as he announced the formal offer this week. \u201cWe think as the relevant authorities look at the fact set around both the competition and potential UK intervention issues that no meaningful concessions will need to be made.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sunday night at 8pm is now the peak time for online shopping, according to new data on the spending patterns of millions of consumers. Rather than being riveted to Planet Earth II or the X Factor final, data from Lloyds Bank suggests the British public are \u201csecond screening\u201d on their sofas, shopping as much as watching. The figures also reveal how at 11am on a Monday morning millions of people are not really working but are buying high-price items after visiting the shops at the weekend. Lloyds said that while Sunday at 8pm is the peak for online shopping in terms of credit card transactions, the peak in terms of the value of items bought is on Mondays at 11am. The figures, based on transactions between September 2015 and August 2016, confirm the growing trend for shoppers to treat stores as showrooms for goods, where they inspect items physically but don\u2019t buy. Instead, they return home to compare prices and decide to make purchases on a Sunday night or Monday morning. Paul Gordon, managing director of credit cards for Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cIt\u2019s likely that the peak we see in online spending by value on a Monday is driven by those who use the weekend to find the goods they want in store, then shop online to make sure they get the best deals as well as by retailers who offer sales and discounts over long weekends, often ending on a Monday. \u201cAs for online spending by volume, it looks like we\u2019re most likely to spend online on a Sunday evening while we\u2019re watching The X Factor or Planet Earth.\u201d Andy Mulcahy of IMRG, the UK trade body for online retailers, said Monday morning used to be the busiest time for online retailers, as customers relied on desktop computers at work to make purchases, but Sunday night has become the peak as people have shifted to using smartphones. The switch in spending to Sunday nights has also forced retailers to operate vast warehouses open 24 hours to meet demand and promises of immediate delivery \u2013 and replace people with robots. Early next year Amazon will open the UK\u2019s largest ever warehouse, close to Tilbury docks in east London, partly staffed by robots, which will \u201chelp speed order processing time and reduce walking time\u201d. Using robots means 50% more items can be stocked per square foot, it said. It said its \u201cPrime Day\u201d record for delivery stands at 10 minutes and 11 seconds. A customer clicked on a Playstation video game at home in Beeston and received it just 10 minutes later via the company\u2019s Leeds distribution centre. But despite the phenomenal growth in online shopping in the UK \u2013 which is higher than in France, Spain and Italy combined \u2013 it still lags behind traditional high street spending, said Lloyds. Britain\u2019s biggest bank said that by value, 80% of its card spending is in store and 20% is online. It added that it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that Saturday remains the busiest day of the week for card usage in stores, with the tills ringing at peak volume between 11.30am and 4pm. What may be more surprising is that Sunday is not actually the new Saturday. Volumes of transactions in retailers on a Sunday are high in the middle of the day but spending collapses after 3.30pm as stores are forced to shut. Friday stands out as the second most popular day for shoppers in store, with sales on a Friday afternoon significantly higher than any other afternoon of the week. The Lloyds online shopping data ties in with figures from John Lewis, whose website is one of the biggest online retailers in the UK. It said that 8.30pm to 9.30pm on Sunday is the most popular time for placing orders, closely followed by 9to 10pm on a Monday. It added that shoppers are now more likely to be using phones to go shopping than laptop or tablet computers, particularly during the morning rush hour. John Lewis said: \u201cMobile is the most popular device used to shop on johnlewis.com weekdays between 6am and 9am.\u201d It added that orders placed via smartphones increased by 60% this year. Online shoppers spend remarkably little time browsing web pages before spending. John Lewis said: \u201cWhen shopping online, those who need things urgently typically take less than 6 minutes to make their purchase, whereas those who are looking for inspiration spend an average of 26 minutes browsing before purchasing.\u201d Britain\u2019s biggest online retailers, ranked by traffic volume Amazon Apple Argos Tesco Netflix Asda Marks &amp; Spencer EE Boots Next The Trainline John Lewis O2 Currys Very Source: IMRG comScore Retailer Ranking, September 2016",

Micro Focus is leading the fallers, down 55p to \u00a321.80 on profit taking following its well received figures earlier in the week. UBS analysts cut their rating from buy to neutral and their target price from \u00a324.20 to \u00a323.50. The IT group is buying Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s software business, and the bank said: Notwithstanding the first half\u2019s good results and a $400m planned return of value, we see the upside for the shares as limited now. We see several risks in 2017: (1) HPE has to execute a significant ($700m) carve-out process on its software assets to make them ready to pass-on to Micro Focus. There are risks of delays to the deal\u2019s closing (due in August 2017) and of disruption to sales execution within HPE Software before or around closing. We note that Micro Focus is due to take on the assets at the start of HPE Software\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter which last year accounted for nearly 40% of full year licence sales and profits. (2) Micro Focus\u2019s cash flow, meanwhile, is likely to show the effects of significant legal and advisory fees related to the deal ahead of its closing, and restructuring commitments are likely to be a feature thereafter; (3) There are flow-back risks around the deal which will see HPE shareholders own half the combined company on closing. Meanwhile Dixons Carphone continued to decline after its cautious comments on the outlook on Thursday, down 8.3p to 337.6p. Miners were also under pressure again as the dollar strength hit commodity prices. Antofagasta is down 11p at 672.5p while BHP Billiton has fallen 13p to \u00a312.99. Reckitt Benckiser has lost 87p to \u00a365.88 after it received an increased fine from Australian authorities. Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 1.12 points to 6997.89.

UBS analysts cut their rating from buy to neutral and their target price from \u00a324.20 to \u00a323.50. The IT group is buying Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s software business, and the bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Notwithstanding the first half\u2019s good results and a $400m planned return of value, we see the upside for the shares as limited now.</p> <p>We see several risks in 2017: (1) HPE has to execute a significant ($700m) carve-out process on its software assets to make them ready to pass-on to Micro Focus. There are risks of delays to the deal\u2019s closing (due in August 2017) and of disruption to sales execution within HPE Software before or around closing. We note that Micro Focus is due to take on the assets at the start of HPE Software\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter which last year accounted for nearly 40% of full year licence sales and profits. (2) Micro Focus\u2019s cash flow, meanwhile, is likely to show the effects of significant legal and advisory fees related to the deal ahead of its closing, and restructuring commitments are likely to be a feature thereafter; (3) There are flow-back risks around the deal which will see HPE shareholders own half the combined company on closing. </p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Dixons Carphone</strong> continued to decline after its cautious comments on the outlook on Thursday, down 8.3p to 337.6p. </p> <p>Miners were also under pressure again as the dollar strength hit commodity prices. <strong>Antofagasta</strong> is down 11p at 672.5p while<strong> BHP Billiton</strong> has fallen 13p to \u00a312.99.</p> <p><strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> has lost 87p to \u00a365.88 after it received<strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/16/nurofen-makers-fine-for-misleading-consumers-increased-from-17m-to-6m\"> an increased fine from Australian authorities.</a></strong></p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has dipped 1.12 points to 6997.89.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps,<strong> </strong><strong>Rentokil Initial</strong> has jumped 85p to \u00a365.90 after the company formed a joint venture to combine its workwear and hygiene units with those of Germany\u2019s Haniel.

      "bodyText": "Southern rail drivers are on their third day of strike action after the operator imposed a plan to remove guards from trains. Here a member of Aslef, the drivers\u2019 union, explains how essential guards are to his work. He asked to remain anonymous for fear of recriminations from his bosses. \u201cI drive most of the Southern routes. The early starts are about 4am and the latest we finish can be one or two o\u2019clock in the morning. You pick up your turn of duty \u2013 that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to drive for the day \u2013 and off you go. And you never know what the day will bring. \u201cUp and down the mainline, we rarely have less than eight cars. At rush hour, that\u2019s 1,500 passengers, at least. When you go in from Croydon, they\u2019re packed in like sardines. But if you thought about how many people were onboard, you would never open the controller. My ethos is, if I get there safely, the rest of the train and the passengers will. It\u2019s self preservation. We\u2019re in the crumple zone, aren\u2019t we? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to drive this thing: it doesn\u2019t drive itself. A driver has enough to concentrate on without having to worry what\u2019s going on behind him. There have been incidents where drivers have made mistakes when there\u2019s been a ruckus going on in the coach behind them. You\u2019re thinking: what\u2019s going on in there? And before you know it you\u2019ve made a mistake, missed a station or gone past a red [light]. \u201cThe most important time you need the guard is when the driver\u2019s doing something else. When the train goes wrong, or there are long delays, and you\u2019re concentrating on the degrading situation, the last thing you need then is to have to start worrying about what the passengers are doing. \u201cThey\u2019re like herding cats, passengers. You only need one idiot to decide that he\u2019s going to debunk and before you know it half a dozen people have followed. They pull the doors open and get down on to the track, that\u2019s the worst thing you can have. You name a silly thing a passenger can do and probably they\u2019ll do it. Half the time you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind you. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of the guard. You may only want him once in 20 years, but that once he\u2019ll be a lifesaver. Take suicides, which are not uncommon on this railway nowadays. So you get a 12-car train and then somebody is run over. You\u2019ve now not only got to deal with the situation that you\u2019re in a state, but you\u2019ve got a thousand people to deal with as well. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of things guards do. A common occurrence is that passengers in the toilets will hit the alarm instead of flushing the toilet. If you\u2019ve got a guard on, you just make an announcement and he then goes and he sorts it out. Without a guard, we stop at the next station and we have to shut down the train and maybe walk back eight coaches to reset the alarm in the toilet. Now that train then is 10 minutes late. \u201cOpening the doors is not a problem. We already open the doors. That\u2019s part of our duties and has been ever since these trains were introduced. Now they\u2019re saying that we use the monitors in the cab, of which there are 12 if you\u2019ve got a 12-car train. You have to watch all those 12 pictures and decide when it\u2019s safe to close the door. \u201cGuards can see things approaching the platform that a driver can\u2019t see. You know those yellow lines on the platform? That\u2019s what\u2019s known as the corridor, that\u2019s the bit we have to make sure is clear. That\u2019s the only bit we can see. So if anyone\u2019s running for the train and then stumbles out of picture as we move off, we don\u2019t get to see that. So they could stumble and roll under. \u201cNow, since they imposed the new rules, we\u2019re totally responsible for the whole train. There is no guarantee there\u2019s a second person on there; and, if there is, there is no guarantee that they are safety-competent. Once they get rid of the guards, it\u2019s been indicated through the trade union that they would like to take the platform staff away out of this process of dispatching trains. So as you can see this becomes the thin end of a very large wedge.\u201d",
