      "bodyText": "Friday\u2019s front page, and a reminder of what we\u2019ll be covering in a few hours: Friday\u2019s newspapers are heavy with Greek news... A late treat - a video of Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s press conference in Luxembourg tonight, for anyone who missed it at the time (or wants to relive it) PS: Interesting lines from Channel 4\u2019s Paul Mason tonight, on the Greek bank fears: Here\u2019s our latest news story on the unfolding, deepening crisis in the eurozone: Greece faces banking crisis after eurozone meeting breaks down Greece is facing a full-blown banking crisis after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers broke down in acrimony and recrimination on Thursday evening, bringing the prospect of Greek exit from the eurozone a step nearer. Some \u20ac2bn of deposits have been withdrawn from Greek banks so far this week \u2013 including a record \u20ac1bn yesterday \u2013 triggering fears that a breakdown in talks would spark a further flight of funds. The German leader Angela Merkel, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras agreed to stage an emergency EU summit on Monday as a last critical attempt to prevent Greece going bankrupt. A representative of the European Central Bank told the meeting it was unsure whether Greek banks would have the funds to be able to open on Monday. Eurozone talks end without deal as Greek proposals rejectedRead more As thousands of pro-EU protestors gathered outside the Athens parliament building, leaders of the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund aimed bitter criticism at the leftwing Greek government, accusing it of lying to its own people, misrepresenting and misleading other EU leaders, refusing to negotiate seriously, and taking Greece to the brink of catastrophe. The Luxembourg talks broke down within an hour of discussions on the Greek crisis starting, indicating the bad blood between both sides. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, said there was an urgent need for dialogue \u201cwith adults in the room\u201d. She added: \u201cWe can only arrive at a resolution if there is a dialogue. Right now we\u2019re short of a dialogue.\u201d.... Full story here.... The ECB is going to decide tomorrow whether to extend more emergency liquidity to Greece\u2019s banks, to allow them to cope with the outflow of deposits. Yanis Varoufakis has also published a blog post, outlining the plan he put before the eurogroup today: Greece\u2019s Proposals to End the Crisis: My intervention at today\u2019s Eurogroup I recommend reading the whole thing, so I won\u2019t attempt to summarise it. But as a tempter, here\u2019s some of the proposals Greece made today: An extensive (but optimised) privatisation agenda spanning the period 2015-2025 The creation of a fully independent Tax and Customs Authority (under the aegis and supervision of Parliament) A Fiscal Council that oversees the state budget A short-term program for limiting foreclosures and managing non-performing loans Judicial and civil procedure code reforms Liberalising several product markets and services (with protections for middle class values and professions that are part and parcel of society\u2019s fabric) Elimination of many nuisance charges Public administration reforms (introducing proper staff evaluation systems, reducing non-wage costs, modernising and unifying public sector payrolls). Yanis Varoufakis has left the eurogroup meeting, telling reporters only that \u201cI think I\u2019ve spoken enough today.... go home and rest\u201d And who are we to argue? A couple more shots from Athens - a day after pro-government demonstrators paraded in Syntagma Square. What will we get tomorrow?! A dramatic day has ended with pro-European demonstrators taking to the streets of Athens outside the parliament to protest against the government, and insist that Greece remains in the EU. Bloomberg reports that the crowd were pushing for a deal that keeps Greece within the European Union. Spyros Kasimatis, 61, told them: \u201cI\u2019m here to support the cause of staying in Europe. The ripple effects would be disastrous, but it\u2019s difficult to explain this to the unemployed youth.\u201d Alexis Tsipras\u2019s claim this week that the IMF has \u201ccriminal responsibility\u201d for the damage caused to the Greek economy has not gone down well with Christine Lagarde, according to Pablo Rodr\u00edguez of El Mundo. A senior EU official taking part in the meeting told The Guardian that Monday\u2019s summit was convened as soon as EU leaders learned of the collapse of the Luxembourg talks. The spectre of a Greek banking collapse under the weight of withdrawals prompted eurozone heads of government to meet on Monday, he said. Dijsselbloem has also apparently warned that Grexit is a growing danger Jeroen Dijsselbloem has left the Eurogroup meeting tonight, but not before firing another warning at Athens to present new reform plans urgently. We haven\u2019t heard a credible and full plan tonight, he told a reporter outside the event, explaining that Varoufakis\u2019s new fiscal proposals basically covered measures already agreed in the eurozone. What we need are credible measures that will fill in the fiscal gap which are still in the talks, and credible measures to bring the economy back on track. Those measure are not popular, they will not be easy to take. And the big question is whether the Greek government is prepared to take them. Because they are inevitable and they are necessary for Greece. And if they are not prepared to do that they are taking a big, big risk on the future of Greece. So I strongly hope that in the coming days they will come up with those proposals. And with that, Dijsselbloem exited to his limo, closing his door with quite a thump. Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece\u2019s chief negotiator, has told the Guardian that EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker had called Alexis Tsipras last night - and both agreed they would talk again over the weekend. Tsakalatos said: \u201cwhat we need is a mid-term solution that will take us through to the end of 2016. A short-term solution might be the worst of all. What we don\u2019t want is a postponement of issues like Grexit and financing, so the economy remains depressed and people don\u2019t have a shift in better expectations. Optimism is a material force in the economy.\u201d The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has also heard that the ECB expressed concerns today about Greek banks ability to open next week. If you missed tonight\u2019s drama....here\u2019s a video of Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem warning that Greece must seize this \u2018last opportunity\u2019 to get a deal. And that\u2019s the end of Varoufakis\u2019s press conference.... Varoufakis has firmly denied that the European Central Bank warned that Greek banks might not be able to open on Monday, according to Greek journalists. That follows a Reuters report which stated: Two officials said that during the meeting, Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem asked ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure if Greek banks would be able to open tomorrow. Coeure answered: \u201cTomorrow, yes. Monday, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Do you expect a massive flow of capital in Greece tomorrow, and do you think the eurogroup has provoked it in any way? Varoufakis: I think you have been around long enough to know that these are impertinent questions to put to a minister of finance. But he continues by saying: I trust that the Greek people are calm. They understand that this is a very critical period, but they have confidence in Europe and in the Greek government to make sure that we build on the common ground that we Europeans have ...to make sure that no accident happens So the answer to your question must be no. What\u2019s your reaction to Christine Lagarde\u2019s comment tonight that we need \u201cadults in the room\u201d to get a deal? Is there a real disconnect between you? Varoufakis: No. When we discuss things at the sidelines, we may have disagreements, but I don\u2019t feel there is a disconnect. And on the first point, since I took office I have committed to not making disparaging comments about any colleague. I want Greece to raise more money from VAT, Varoufakis insists. But right now, the way to that is to tackle evasion and improve collection, not hit people with higher rates. He\u2019s explaining that the root of the problem in Greece, and the key to his proposals, is to tackle mispractices and clean up the system. Are you worried that capital controls will soon be needed in Greece, to prevent people withdrawing their savings? Varoufakis replies that the outflow of deposits began in December, in a \u201ccynical\u201d move by the previous government. He also condemns the Bank of Greece for fuelling the panic with recent warnings, rather than by providing reassurance as a central bank should. And capital controls, he says, are the \u201cprecise antithesis\u201d to the principles of monetary union. They would show: A monetary union that has failed to ensure the free flow of capital. Varoufakis says he is \u201cvery sad\u201d that our Greek debt swap plan (to get the European bailout fund to take over \u20ac6.7bn maturing Greek debts held by the ECB). Varoufakis is now taking questions. The first was in Greek, so I\u2019ll try to find the answer shortly :) Second question: If you don\u2019t get debt swaps or debt reduction of any time deal, would it be preferable to leave the eurozone? Dealing with the debt repayments of a highly indebted nation state that has no access to markets or devaluation is of the essence in rendering that economy stable and sustainable The IMF has made this point several times - I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t make this point at the eurozone, even though this is part and parcel of its logic. So yes, it\u2019s quite right to assume that debt relief is crucial. But he won\u2019t even consider the second point, that Grexit might be needed. The eurozone is more than just a system of fixed exchange rates, Varoufakis insists. To even begin to imagine the deconstruction of monetary union is to jeopardise the well bring of Europeans, not only those in the eurozone. We are dangerously close to a state of mind that accepts an accident, Varoufakis concludes, urging Greece\u2019s partners not to fall into this trap. Yanis Varoufakis says he presented an \u201cautomated deficit brake\u201d at today\u2019s meeting. That would kick in if there were signs that the Greek budget was heading into deficit. This sounds similar to George Osborne\u2019s proposal to force future UK government to run budget surpluses (which a group of economists dismissed as a gimmick last week) But Varoufakis says it would reassure lenders that Greece was serious about getting its borrowing under control. This was our gesture of goodwill to our partners that this government is keen to reform this country, and put mechanisms in place that are credible and show that the Greek state will not need to borrow again to pay salaries, procurements. and so on. Cutting pension benefit for low-income pensioners would create \u201cpopular discontent\u201d, Varoufakis warns. Our proposals offered an extensive privatisation agenda, a new fiscal council overseeing state budget, liberalising services, he adds. Varoufakis is now repeating his statement, in English. He says that Greece and its creditors are close to a deal on fiscal targets -- the gap is just 0.5%. That is too small a difference to justify this dangerous impasse. He cites a recent blogpost from Olivier Blanchard of the IMF, who said that both sides need to take tough choices. Our economy has experienced a gigantic adjustment since the first bailout programme -- GDP is down 27%, unemployment is over 25%, inflation is minus 2%. And we are losing our best young people as they leave Greece and offer their skills to other nations. Poverty, hunger is rife, investment has dried up. Our allies at Kathimerini have translated Varoufakis\u2019s key points: Varoufakis is now outlining his proposals, in some detail: Varoufakis is speaking in Greek first, and then English (eventually). He says that Greece brought a \u201ccomprehensive proposal\u201d to today\u2019s meeting that would have ended this drama once and for all. But instead, he says, Jeroen Dijsselbloem didn\u2019t encourage creditors to engage. Varoufakis insists that he presented deep economic reforms. And \u201call political leaders bear a responsibility\u201d for finding a solution. Yanis Varoufakis is now giving his own press conference: Relations between Greece and its creditors were already bad, and they\u2019ve got even worse. Another meeting with no progress means it\u2019s very hard to see how a deal will be reached before June 30, to avoid the default that\u2019s been looming over the eurozone for months. Indeed, EU leaders have clearly had enough -- with an emergency summit set for Monday. That is your last chance saloon, Mr Tsipras. Greece has effectively been instructed to come back with new proposals in the next few days, otherwise it\u2019s game over. Grexit is no longer unthinkable -- with Dijsselbloem saying that all eventualities are being considered And Christine Lagarde\u2019s comment that we need \u201cadults in the room\u201d suggests a complete breakdown in relations. Back with the Maltese finance minister: Money appears to be leaving Greek banks faster than emergency liquidity from the ECB is arriving. How worried are you about that, asks my colleague Ian Traynor. Dijsselbloem says he can\u2019t confirm the figures (there\u2019s a rumour that \u20ac2bn was withdrawn between Monday and Wednesday) But... It\u2019s worrying. The key word is trust. Trust needs to return to the Greek economy. People are taking money of the bank because they are worried about what the future will bring. But it can be fixed quickly by the Greek government. Are you now planning for a Grexit? It is our dearest wish to keep Greece in the eurozone, Dijsselbloem replies. But if that is not possible, we are prepared for all eventualities. What is your message to the people of Greece? Dijsselbloem replies: They deserve a credible and a fair deal. Which means Greece has to become financially independence, and have its future in its own hand Any deal that doesn\u2019t deliver a fair and sustainable financial future for Greece would eb a bad deal for Greece too. We are still fully committed to keeping Greece in the euro, he says. But it will be impossible to reach that deal unless you are prepared to take some tough decisions. Decisions on Restructuring the economy, restrucutring the public sector. And it also \u201crequires politicians who are prepared to tell the truth to their people\u201d. Outside the press conference, the Maltese finance minister has told Reuters that Yanis Varoufakis came up with \u201ca sort of\u201d last minute plan. OUCH. For a Greek deal to happen, there have to be \u201cadults in the room\u201d, says Christine Lagarde. Just how bad was today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting? We are \u201cprepared for eventualities\u201d if no agreement can be reached, Dijsselbloem says. That isn\u2019t our \u201cpreferred scenario\u201d, though. Dijsselbloem confirms that Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has called a Eurozone leaders meeting on Monday. And he also suggests that another eurogroup meeting could be required first, so that something can be prepared for the leaders to discuss. Onto questions. Is a bailout extension being discussed? Dijsselbloem says that if there is a deal with Greece, then it will have to include an extension because there simply isn\u2019t time to get agreement and disburse funds by June 30. Lagarde concludes: We are waiting, and we hope that the next few days will be used by the Greek authorities to come back with credible, tangible measures.... Lagarde explains that a successful programme has four elements: debt sustainability delivery of the measures financing of the programme flexibilility of the institutions, accepting substitutability of the measures. And \u201cThe less the adjusting, the more the financing\u201d. In simple language, that means that Greece should be allowed to propose new measures, but only if they are credible. And if Greece imposes less tax rises and spending cuts, it creates a fiscal gap that can only be filled with more borrowing or debt relief. And Europe is still resisting debt relief. Now Christine Lagarde has the microphone. On Greece, she wants to make a few basic points: We are waiting. The institutions have put together some very sensible proposals that are a clear easing and we are waiting\u201d Jumping between French and English, the IMF MD says: It cannot be about smoke and mirrors.... It must be credible. We lend the money of 188 countries, and we are accountable to all of them. Moscovici reiterates that the eurozone are ready to work \u201cday and night\u201d for a deal. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici speaks next (mainly in French), and warns that Greece risks a \u201ccatastrophic scenario\u201d unless it engages seriously with negotiations. It is in everyone\u2019s interest that Greece remains in the Euro zone, we are making progress, he says. Reuters is reporting that there will be a eurozone leaders summit on Monday to discuss Greece.... Apparently Germany\u2019s finance minister has left the eurogroup without speaking to the media: An agreement needs to be credible, Dijsselbloem adds. If one is put forward in the next few days, we will consider it. There is still time to find an agreement and extend the current programme. But very little time remains, (as it might need to be voted on by some national parliaments) And the ball is in Greece\u2019s court. Dijsselbloem: We agreed to be flexible in February, when Greece\u2019s bailout was extended. We agreed to adjust the fiscal targets for Greece, and to replace existing measures with other measures put forward by the Greeks, once we had assessed them. Too little measures have been put forward that are credible. The talks over the last weeks have not progressed.... Dijsselbloem starts by saying that the eurogroup took stock of the situation with Greece. It is regrettable that too little progress has been made in the talks, and \u201cno agreement is in sight\u201d. OK, the first press conference is starting now, with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup, plus Christine Lagarde, Pierre Moscovici and Klaus Regling. The lack of a deal tonight isn\u2019t really a surprise -- expectations were really rather low this morning. Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi suggests we could be weeks away from a resolution: Finland\u2019s finance minister tweets that it was an \u2018interesting\u2019 meeting.... You can watch tonight\u2019s press conferences from Luxembourg here: The Eurogroup meeting has concluded, without a deal on Greece. And that\u2019s according to Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commission Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue. He has tweeted that eurozone finance ministers have given a \u201cstrong signal\u201d to Greece to engage seriously. The eurogroup is ready to reconvene at any moment, he adds. It doesn\u2019t sound good news, frankly. Press conferences will begin in a few minutes. Another important development: Yanis Varoufakis has been presenting new proposals to his fellow eurozone finance ministers. According to one report, he\u2019s presented five pages of ideas. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, says Athens still wants Europe\u2019s bailout fund to help it, by buying the \u20ac6.7bn of bonds it must repay to the ECB this summer. One Greek official told Reuters: \u201cVaroufakis is presenting new ideas right now...The proposals are based on fiscal consolidation that needs to go with debt sustainability.\u201d Athens also downplayed speculation that the two sides were at odds: \u201cThere is no clash. We are negotiating. We are open to proposals.\u201d As we covered earlier, Varoufakis declared that he would present proposals to \u201creplace costly discord with effective consensus.\u201d His press conference later tonight could be a sellout. Diplomatics in Luxembourg are downplaying Die Zeit\u2019s claim that Greece is being offered a short-term deal by the eurozone. The euro soared, then slumped, as traders digested Die Zeit\u2019s claim that Greece is getting a \u2018final offer\u2019: Perhaps traders are concerned that the story isn\u2019t sourced, and only four paragraphs long.... German newspaper Die Zeit is reporting tonight that the eurozone is proposing extending Greece\u2019s current bailout until the end of the year. According to Die Ziet\u2019s story, Greece would receive \u20ac10bn of cash which is currently set aside to recapitalise the Greek banking sector. The ECB would also raise the cap on Greek banks, allowing them to buy another \u20ac2bn of government debt. Together, this would allow Greece to meet its repayments to the IMF and the ECB this summer. It is billed as a \u201cfinal offer\u201d to Greece to avoid bankruptcy. The IMF wouldn\u2019t be involved in the plan -- understandable, given its concerns that Greece\u2019s debt burden is now unsustainable, meaning debt relief is needed. So, it sounds like the short-term can-kicking offer that some analysts had expected. There has been speculation that the bank recapitalisation money could be used in this way. But a word of caution -- it is not clear what conditions Greece would have to agree to. More as we get it. I was going to put together a summary, but AFP have just published a really decent round-up of events. So, over to them... (with links to the main points in today\u2019s liveblog) IMF rules out Greek payment delay International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned Greece on Thursday it would get no leeway on a huge debt payment as EU ministers warned they were looking at a \u201cplan B\u201d for a possible default. Eurozone finance ministers holding a crisis meeting in Luxembourg [photos] pressed Athens to finally present a credible reform plan and end the five-month standoff between Greece\u2019s anti-austerity government and its creditors. But with Athens owing a 1.6-billion-euro payment to the IMF at the end of June and Greece\u2019s international bailout due to expire the same day, they were pessimistic about the chances of a deal on Thursday. \u201cThere will be no period of grace\u201d for the loan payment, Lagarde told reporters before she joined the ministers for their Eurogroup meeting. \u201cI have a term of June 30 - if it\u2019s not paid by July 1, it\u2019s not paid.\u201d Greece\u2019s creditors are withholding the last \u20ac7.2bn of its bailout until Athens caves in, but leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has refused to make changes to pensions and VAT rates. Europe\u2019s most powerful leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, weighed in on the issue earlier Thursday when she told German lawmakers in the Bundestag she was \u201cstill confident\u201d that a deal was possible. - \u2018Not a lot of hope\u2019 - But the mood was darker in an overcast Luxembourg, where ministers were openly broaching scenarios such as a Greek exit from the euro if it defaults on its debts. \u201cThe next step to make the deal credible, also financially sustainable, will have to come from the Greek side,\u201d the Dutch Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters. He added that he did \u201cnot have a lot of hope\u201d that the Greeks would present a new plan Thursday. No deal at the Eurogroup meeting means the issue will likely go to the wire at an EU leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels on June 25 and 26. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, the motorbike-riding former economist whose relations with his counterparts have been strained, said he wanted to \u201creplace costly discord with effective consensus.\u201d \u201cToday we are going to be presenting the Greek government ideas,\u201d he added, without specifying whether he meant a new reform plan. Without the bailout tranche and the IMF deadline missed, Greece would be for the first time in five years financially alone, with its coffers empty and all eyes on what happens next. \u201cThe other option is to prepare the B plan,\u201d said Irish finance minister Michael Noonan, adding that he didn\u2019t fear any \u201ccontagion effect\u201d in the case of a \u201cGrexit\u201d - meaning Greece crashing out of the euro. Finnish Finance Minister Alex Stubb added: \u201cOption number 1 is extension .... Option B could be default.\u201d The IMF has taken a harder line than its co-bailout monitors the European Commission and European Central Bank, pushing for Europe to write off some Greek debts. Greece had already bought itself time by bundling four looming IMF loan payments into one lump sum to be paid by June 30 - becoming the first country to use such a possibility since Zambia in the 1980s - and it is losing patience. - No Waterloo - The coincidence that the Eurogroup was meeting on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo led EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici to draw a comparison between then and now. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t want this to be a \u2018Battle of Waterloo\u2019 with the whole of Europe against one state,\u201d he said. Greece\u2019s central bank warned for the first time Wednesday that the country could suffer a \u201cpainful\u201d exit from the single currency area - and even the European Union - if it fails to reach a deal. Greece has another \u20ac6.7bn due to the European Central Bank in July and August and there have been reports of planning for possible capital controls if Greece\u2019s financial system runs dry. European officials warned that the IMF\u2019s zero-tolerance on July 1 could also force the European Central Bank to cut-off vital financing to Greece\u2019s creaking banks. Elected in January on a vow to end five years of bailout-imposed austerity, Tsipras warned Wednesday that an EU \u201cfixation\u201d with pension cuts would scupper a deal and harm Europe as a whole. In a move that seemed calculated to irk other European leaders amid tensions with Russia over Ukraine, Tsipras visited Saint Petersburg Thursday where he is the star guest at President Vladimir Putin\u2019s investment drive forum. [end] European stock markets shook off their Greek fears by the close of trading. Most indices finished higher, matching rises on Wall Street where shares rallied after the Federal Reserve dampened fears of an early rate rise. Tony Cross of Trustnet says investors are waiting for any signs of a resolution over the Greek debt crisis: Obviously any further word on what happens next in Greece will be closely followed, but until we see this, it seems as if equity markets are happy to tread water. While Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sees little sign for optimism today: Given that German Chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated the creditor\u2019s position in a speech to the Bundestag earlier today that no money would be released unless Greece implemented reforms, the prospect of any sort of deal seems more remote than ever. The Eurogroup agenda has been slightly reshuffled, the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel reports, so that ministers will cover all the other business before Greece. No deadlines in the liveblog, obviously! Earlier this week, EU negotiators had suggested the Greek discussion would be quite short. What is there to talk about, they suggested? Perhaps this reshuffle means they expect a longer debate? After that early wobble, the Athens stock market ended the day up 0.37%. The news that Yanis Varoufakis is going to present some ideas at today\u2019s meeting may have generated some optimism, after the index hit a three-year low this morning. Here\u2019s our economics editor, Larry Elliott, explaining why the Greek crisis gives Angela Merkel such a headache (including references to Bob Dylan and British left-winger Ken Livingstone) Students of body language will have a field day with these photos from the eurogroup meeting, showing most of the main characters in this crisis: Greece\u2019s battered economy is sinking even deeper into the mire, according to two pieces of information today. First, Reuters is reporting that two billion euros were withdrawn from Greek banks between Monday morning and Wednesday night. That would be a significant acceleration in the steady outflow, that has already pushed deposit levels to 11-year lows. Before talks collapsed last weekend, Greek banks were losing \u20ac200m to \u20ac300m per day. The second worrying news is that government revenue tumbled in May, as households and firms hoarded cash and delayed filing tax returns. Greek government revenues in May were 24% under target -- or around \u20ac900m. That\u2019s a remarkable shortfall. But Greece is still running a primary budget surplus this year, because it has deferred so much of its own spending. As one senior banker told the Financial Times: \u201cThere appears to be a complete freeze on domestic payments apart from wages and pensions as the government rounds up cash to pay international creditors,\u201d \u201cThis is starting to have a knock-on effect on revenue collection.\u201d Just feel that tension.... Not quite as friendly as four months ago, when Lagarde turned up in a leather jacket in solidarity with Yanis, who sported a Burberry scarf. The eurogroup meeting is now underway. It\u2019s a packed agenda -- ministers are talking about the Cyprus bailout, Portugal, the state of the eurozone, and implications of the current record low interest rates. And Greece, of course -- with Yanis Varoufakis presenting his new ideas. A press conference will be held later, perhaps at 7pm BST? If Greece does fail to repay the IMF on 30 June, the consequences could be very nasty. Klaus Regling, who runs the Europe\u2019s bailout fund (the ESM) told reporters in Luxembourg that an IMF default could trigger clauses in ESM lending, allowing it to demand early repayment on its own loans. He\u2019s not saying that would definitely happen, but that\u2019s the procedure. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has the quote: Patience is a virtue, but some countries are running out of patience. says Finland\u2019s finance minister Alex Stubb. In the EU, if you make a deal, you\u2019re supposed to stick with it, he adds, somewhat archly. There has been too much going back and forth in recent months. Stubb thinks there are two options, either a new deal for Greece with some \u2018conditionally\u2019, or a plan B, which could result in a default. And he argues that there\u2019s little risk of contagion for the eurozone if Greece defaulted. Christine Lagarde defended the IMF\u2019s handling of the Greek debt crisis as she arrived at today\u2019s meeting. When we make a loan, the money comes from Senegal, Sri Lanka, Switzerland.... so we need to be credible because it\u2019s their money we\u2019re lending. But we also need to be flexible, she adds: If there are credible proposals on the table then of course we\u2019ll examine them. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, told reporters that he is \u201coptimistic\u201d that ministers will now get proposals from Greece. Asked about the dangers of \u201cGrexit\u201d, he replied: \u201cOne mustn\u2019t speak in public about everything.\u201d (Don\u2019t get all coy on us, Wolfgang!) Pierre Moscovici says that a solution is badly needed, both for Greece and the wider eurozone project. Let\u2019s start by examining proposals..... we are in a state of mind to find a deal, which is indispensible. But it\u2019s up to the Greeks to deliver. The ball is in their camp (oh god, not again) Moscovici (a former French finance minister) has also joked about how he hopes to avoid another Waterloo, on the 200th anniversary of that famous away win. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan told reporters that we shouldn\u2019t have \u201cany great expectations\u201d for a positive outcome from today\u2019s meeting. Discussions will be preliminary, before Greece is discussed by heads of government next week. There is \u201cno optimism among the people I\u2019ve spoken to today\u201d. Noonan says discussions have taken place at a high level in Ireland in case Greece leaves the eurozone, involving the ECB, but believes there is still time and space to get a deal. Noonan adds that he has heard that the Greek finance minister plans to \u201cmake an intervention\u201d at today\u2019s meeting. He\u2019s not sure what it is, but we\u2019ll see. I\u2019ve heard Yanis\u2019s proposals before, they tend to be macroeconomic in nature rather than about specifics, and these proposals need to be about specifics, Noonan concludes. Ireland\u2019s finance minister says the eurozone cannot make further concessions to Greece. Peter Kazimir, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, has arrived. He denies being angry with Greece. I\u2019m tired, he says, and I\u2019m not the only minister tired on this issue We need to be honest, he says, there is no time left for the games. and we have to deliver. Greece must face the reality - they might like it, we may not like it, but we cannot shake the reality When a bill is due, certain things need to be done. You cannot cheat it.... What do you think about Yanis Varoufakis saying he has brought some ideas today? Kazimir smiles. Now is a good time for ideas, he replies. We have wasted a lot of time. but I do believe in miracles - I\u2019m Catholic, so I have to believe in miracles. Is this the time to talk about capital controls? We need to be ready for everything, Kazimir replies. Here\u2019s a video clip of Yanis Varoufakis saying he will present ideas to \u201creplace costly discord with effective consensus\u201d (but not revealing if they are old ideas or new ones) More arrivals! France\u2019s Michel Sapin says talks must resume, and it\u2019s wrong to think there are \u201cmonstrous differences\u201d between two sides. Yanis Varoufakis has just arrived. He tells reporters: Mario Draghi once said that for the euro to succeed anywhere, it has to succeed everywhere. We think he is spot on. And today we will be presenting the Greek government\u2019s ideas along those lines. And then he adds: The purpose is to replace costly discord with effective consensus. With that, Varoufakis vanishes inside the building. Does that mean that Greece has brought some new proposals?..... Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg\u2019s finance minister, has warned that \u201ctime is coming to an end\u201d, as he arrives at the Eurogroup. He hopes to make progress at today\u2019s meetings, and doesn\u2019t accept that Greece is heading out of the eurozone: We are still on the same lines, Greece and the rest of Europe.... We need a deal so Greece can start to grow again, and attract investors. That really wasn\u2019t a very confident-looking eurogroup president who swept into today\u2019s meeting. Dijsselbloem gives little indication that there will be a breakthrough today. Too little progress has been made, and there are still gaps between Greece and the institutions, he adds. Time is very, very short. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup, has just arrived at this afternoon\u2019s meeting, and is being grilled by the EU press pack. Asked about Christine Lagarde\u2019s comments, Dijsselbloem says he won\u2019t speculate about whether or not Greece will make its 30 June repayment. Only have one job today, to see if we can get that deal with Greece closer It need a solid deal, for Greece and Europe that can hold up in the coming years, says Dijsselbloem, adding: I am not sure if we will make any progress, but we will try. The arrivals are being streamed live here. Has Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alex Stubb, just uttered the D word?.... We\u2019ve put together a chart to guide you through the next few crucial days for Greece, and the eurozone: Eurozone finance ministers have already held one session today -- the annual meeting of the European Stability Mechanism Board (that\u2019s the main Eurozone bailout fund). Here\u2019s some photos: Greece has arguably been given one delay by the IMF already, which is perhaps why Christine Lagarde says it can\u2019t have another one. This 30 June payment consists of four smaller bills due this month, which are being wrapped together. That\u2019s within the Fund\u2019s rules, but is also the first time in decades that any country (hello Zambia!) has done it. Public support for Alexis Tsipras\u2019s party is still holding up, according to a new poll this morning. There could be shockwaves through Greece and the wider eurozone if Athens doesn\u2019t repay the IMF on 30 June, says Diego Iscaro, senior economist at IHS Global Insight. Even though it\u2019s not a technical default, Iscaro reckons a non-payment would trigger volatility: Deposit outflows in Greek banks are likely to accelerate, increasing the pressure on the government to introduce capital controls. Meanwhile, increasing uncertainty regarding the outcome of the negotiations will result in higher volatility in Eurozone financial markets (most likely through pressurizing bond yields in the southern periphery countries), as well as weighing down on confidence levels. Got it in one.... Christine Lagarde\u2019s demand for an \u201cintelligent approach\u201d to Greek pensions is the latest shot in an intense war of words between the two sides. Alexis Tsipras has argued this morning that Greece cannot accept pension cuts. Writing in Der Tagesspiegel, Tsipras pointed out that pensioners are actually the main breadwinner in many Greek families: The social security system is the institutionalized mechanism of intergenerational solidarity, and its sustainability is a main concern for society as a whole. Traditionally, this solidarity has meant that young people, through their contributions, fund the pensions of their parents. But during the Greek crisis, we\u2019ve witnessed this solidarity being reversed as the parents\u2019 pensions fund the survival of their children. The pensions of the elderly are often the last refuge for entire families that have only one or no member working in a country with 25% unemployment in the general population, and 50% among young people. Faced with such a situation we cannot adopt the logic of blind and horizontal cuts, as some have asked us to do, which would result in dramatic social consequences. Christine Lagarde has just crushed the idea that Greece could delay its \u20ac1.6bn repayment due to the International Monetary Fund on 30 June. There is no chance of a \u2018grace period\u2019 or a delay, the IMF chief says: Yesterday, Greece admitted that it won\u2019t have the money to repay the IMF unless it gets a bailout deal fast, meaning it would be in arrears with the Fund (this isn\u2019t an official default, though) We\u2019re facing a \u201cvery difficult situation\u201d, says Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alex Stubb, as he arrives at the Eurogroup meeting. And you\u2019ll never guess where the ball is..... Alexis Tsipas has just been sighted in Russia, which might cause a few alarm bells to ring in Brussels and Washington. The Greek PM is attending an economic forum in St Petersburg, and is due to meet President Putin tomorrow. This has fuelled talk that Moscow could offer Athens some help - perhaps a credit line, to help it handle debt repayments. Greek officials have been defending the trip, though, arguing they are allowed to pursue a \u2018multi-dimensional foreign policy\u2019. And after all, Germany does a lot of business with Russia (before the Ukraine sanctions, anyway) There are reports swirling that the European Commission and the European Central Bank are drafting some kind of statement on the issue of Greek debt relief. Not clear exactly what, at this stage, so we\u2019ll keep you posted. The EC and ECB have been resisting pressure from Athens, and the IMF, to consider the issue of Greece\u2019s debt pile, which appears simply unsustainable at 180% of GDP. My colleague Heather Stewart has looked at this issue, and explains: When debt repayments reach a certain level, they undermine social solidarity because governments struggle to afford investment in schools, health and public services. And they undermine economic growth, because the state has to divert resources that could be spent on infrastructure, training and export support towards its foreign creditors. Bank of Greece governor Yannis Stournaras continues to be criticised by government MPs today, after warning yesterday of an \u201cuncontrollable crisis\u201d unless a deal is reached: Over in Athens there has been some fighting talk from senior members of the governing far left Syriza party this morning, reports our correspondent Helena Smith. With no signs of a deal in sight, leading Syriza party cadres are now being asked, outright, whether euro exit is on the cards. Speaking to Mega TV this morning, the party\u2019s hardline social security minister Dimitris Stratoulis said the leftist-led government had already \u201ctaken measures\u201d to ensure that ordinary Greeks did not suffer in the event of an agreement not being reached. \u201cWe have seen to it that people won\u2019t have a problem if we reach the point of having to say the big no,\u201d he said, insisting that if Athens did not pay the IMF the \u20ac1.6bn it owes at the end of the month it would not amount to a credit event (default). Presumably, with that in mind, Stratoulis also said that the government would have the means to pay public sector salaries and pensions \u201cin July, August, September, October etc.\u201d \u201cIf we are forced to say the big no the difficulties will last for a few months \u2026. but the consequences will be much worse for Europe.\u201d Thanasis Petrakos, Syriza\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, reiterated that Athens would not give in to the \u201cirrational demands\u201d of lenders. \u201cWe want to stay in the euro zone but we will not submit to blackmail, if our partners want to be logical we will come to an agreement,\u201d he said told Star TV. \u201cCurrencies aren\u2019t a religion,\u201d he said to the surprise of the startled news anchor Popi Tsapanidou. \u201cWho said currencies are a religion? Nothing of the sort is written in our constitution.\u201d What was most important was that Greece did not return to the era of \u201cmemoranda\u201d (the bailout agreement), he argued Kostas Lapavitsas, the London University economics professor who is now a Syriza MP, agreed. \u201cThat would mean death,\u201d Lapavitsas told Star TV. \u201cNow that we are in the euro what lenders are dong essentially means we have limited sovereignty.\u201d Any \u201cadjustment period\u201d that did take place in event of euro exit would only last a few months, he said. \u201cThe idea that we can\u2019t live with our own currency is absurd.\u201d European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has predicted that today\u2019s eurogroup meeting will be \u2018difficult\u2019, Reuters reports (possibly winning a prize for understatement). Moscovici told reporters that a solution can still be found, even at this late hour, if there are cool heads and political will. \u201cToday\u2019s meeting might not be conclusive, we all know that, but it must be useful. It must be a meeting that opens the way for a solution, if we cannot find it today. We\u2019ll try, we must try.\u201d. But the ball is still in the Greek court, he added (a phrase we have heard quite enough this week) Belgium\u2019s finance minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, has told reporters in Luxembourg that today\u2019s meeting \u201call depends\u201d on what Greece proposes. He told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what they bring to the table. I don\u2019t know whatMr Varoufakis is coming up with. If there are reasonable proposals we will discuss them. Some European finance ministers are already arriving in Luxembourg for the eurogroup meeting, but most of them are staying silent. Eek. The Athens stock market is now down 3.5%, extending those early losses. Alpha Bank shares has tumbled almost 9%, with Piraeus Bank down 6.8% and Eurobank down 5.3% Amid all the trouble and strife gripping Greece, it\u2019s emerged that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s domestic bliss is also on the line. The Greek prime minister reportedly admitted to French president Francois Hollande that his partner, Peristera (Betty) Baziana, would leave him if he caves in to Greece\u2019s creditors. That\u2019s according to French satirical magazine Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9, which claims Hollande said: \u201c[Tsipras] informed me that if he gave in to too many of the troika\u2019s demands, he risked not only losing his party but also his partner, who is a fierce militant and is much farther left of him.\u201d Alexis and Betty have known each other for decades; she\u2019s credited with having encouraging him to join the communist party. As we wrote back in January: The two have kept their 30-year relationship largely out of the public eye. Unlike the first ladies that have come before her, Batziana has so far stayed away from the glamour that will come with the Maximos mansion, the official seat of the Greek prime minister. The flat she shares with her partner and their two young sons is in the heart of working class district Kypseli, in Athens. Heads-up. The head of the Eurogroup will speak to the media around 1.15pm BST (3.15pm Athens time). That\u2019s before today\u2019s meeting of finance ministers kicks off (so to speak). There\u2019s a lot on the agenda, apart from Greece, so the meeting could last until 7pm BST. Expectations, as I flagged up in the introduction, are not high. Or, as Hans Nichols of Bloomberg put it: They\u2019re below low. They\u2019re subterranean. With shares down across Europe, traders are bracing for a long, painful summer, says David Madden of IG: The word \u2018default\u2019 is being bandied around the trading floor even more so, and there are only so many times dealers will stare at the sea of red screens before they jump ship. The left-wing Syriza is determined it will not be the first one to blink and the ECB continues to stand its ground, but playing chicken with people who have nothing to lose is a dangerous game. The pressure is intense, even by Greek debt crisis standards, and one by one dealers are ducking of out the market. Greece\u2019s stock market has fallen almost 2% in early trading, hitting a new three-year low. The Athens market has now shed 18% of its value since last Thursday (!), in a broad-based and unnerving rout. Shares jumped last week on the back of reports that Germany was open to a \u2018staggered deal\u2019 for Greece, but has been sliding since as both sides have entrenched their positions. Euclid Tsakalotos has also told France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration that Greece\u2019s people could be asked to vote on its future, echoing his comments on the Today Programme. The Athens government could call fresh elections or a referendum if it cannot get an acceptable deal, chief negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos suggests. Asked for his contingency plan in case Greece leaves the euro, he replies: Our position is that if we have an economically feasible plan that doesn\u2019t create recession and continue the debt trap we will sign. If we don\u2019t, we have to go to the Greek people because we have no mandate to leave the euro, and that would be a very bad eventuality. But we will consult the Greek people. Becuase our mandate was the best possible deal within the euro, as we are pro-European. If that is not on the cards, and if Europe says you can do whatever you want, you can vote what you want but in the end you always have to do the same policies, then we\u2019ll have to reconsider with the Greek people what to do about that. While Merkel was addressing the German parliament, Greece\u2019s chief negotiator was warning the British people that Europe could be plunged into Depression-era economics if Greece were to leave the euro. Speaking on the Today Programme, Euclid Tsakalotos argued that Grexit would radically change the nature of the single currency My greatest fear as a progressive person, Taskalotos said, is that: \u201conce one country has left, you change a monetary union into a fixed exchange rate system, where it\u2019s a cost-benefit analysis whether another country leaves\u201d. My greatest fear is that the break-up of the euro will return (us) to the competitive devaluations, and the nationalisms, and the kind of politics we had in the 1930s.\u201d But if Greece stays in, isn\u2019t the lesson to other countries with similar problems is \u2018we don\u2019t actually need to pay our debt\u2019? No, Tsakalotos argues. the lesson is that we need to stop financial markets going on a lending spree: When someone has borrowed too much, someone else has lent too much... Cue much spluttering from John Humphrys - That\u2019s like a drunk blaming the barman for selling him the drink. Tsakalotos won\u2019t take this lying down; he reminds Humphrys that Greece\u2019s debt/GDP ratio has done up from 129% to 180% since its first bailout programme began. A different approach is needed. Oppermann of the SPD went on to talk about the British referendum on EU membership, which could be held as early as next year. He is hoping for a yes vote, saying: Britain is a great political, economic and cultural force in Europe. We owe Britain a lot \u2013 it gave us the first parliamentary democracy. He mentioned Magna Carta, and the fact that many Britons lost their lives in the battle against Hitler Germany. Without Britain, the EU\u2019s foreign policy would have less weight. But Europe can\u2019t function like a sweet dispenser where everyone picks the best bits. Europe does not work if everyone thinks only of their own advantages. If the \u201cI\u201d becomes a \u201cwe\u201d we can emerge from the crisis. Following Merkel\u2019s speech, Gregor Gysi, of the Left Party, launched a blistering attack on the German government\u2019s eurozone policies. Now Thomas Oppermann, who heads up the Social Democrat group in the Bundestag, has warned that \u201ctime is running out\u201d for Greece. He accused the Syriza government, elected in January, of wasting its first few months in office by giving interviews \u2013 \u201cI find this irresponsible.\u201d He added that he got the impression that the Greek government didn\u2019t really want to negotiate, and took issue with its branding of the IMF as \u201ccriminal\u201d. But, he said: It\u2019s five to 12. I still hope we can get a fair solution. Europe\u2019s stock markets are in the red again, despite Merkel\u2019s pledge to keep working towards a Greek deal. Most indices are at fresh four-month lows: As usual, Merkel delivered a very measured speech. The only stab at passion was when she said the euro is far more than just a currency. That concludes Merkel\u2019s statement \u2013 she has received a lot of applause from MPs in the German parliament. Merkel is now talking about Greece. Greece was on a good path, but it has not been completed. It has dragged its heels on necessary structural reforms. She is heckled when she says: \u201cSelf-responsibility and solidarity go hand in hand.\u201d She reiterates that Germany is working to keep Greece in the euro, using her mantra \u201cwhere there is a will, there is a way\u201d. A deal is still possible with Greece\u2019s three international creditors \u2013 the EU, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank. Merkel says the EU summit next week won\u2019t discuss Britain\u2019s demands for EU reforms, but Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, will be asked to examine them. But, Merkel stresses, the principle of freedom of movement within the EU is not up for debate. The German chancellor says it\u2019s not the first time that a member state has sought to clarify its role within the EU, but in the end, compromises were always found. She mentions Denmark in 1992 and Ireland in 2008. I\u2019m confident that we can achieve this this time. [i.e. keep Britain in the EU] On to Brexit: Merkel says she wants Britain to continue to be an \u201cactive partner in a strong EU\u201d. Britain needs to figure out itself what role it wants to play in Europe, she says. Merkel is now talking about the eurozone. France and Germany will be pushing for the coordination of economic policies within the current treaties \u2013 to boost competitiveness and jobs, she says. This means more structural reforms by member states. The EU summit will address immigration policy, she says, particularly the \u201ctragedies\u201d in the Mediterranean. Thousands of migrants have died trying to cross the Mediterranean in recent months, and thousands of others have been rescued. After a brief mic malfunction, Merkel is speaking now. German chancellor Angela Merkel is due to give a statement on next week\u2019s EU summit in the German parliament shortly. You can watch it live here. French finance minister Michel Sapin has set the tone for today\u2019s meeting by warning it would be a \u201ctotal catastrophe\u201d for Greece if Athens left the eurozone. France was doing all it could to find a deal, he told the France Info radio, adding: \u201cWe will fight till the end to find an agreement with Greece.\u201d Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to fall again today, extending recent losses, as investors watch the Greece crisis play out. Here\u2019s the pre-market predictions: FTSE100 is expected to open 20 points lower at 6,660 DAX is expected to open 90 points lower at 10,888 CAC40 is expected to open 35 points lower at 4,755 Last night, Fed chief Janet Yellen warned there will be \u201cspillover effects\u201d across the financial markets if the Greek crisis ends badly. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets confirms that hopes for today\u2019s meeting aren\u2019t high: Today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg has been touted as the \u201clast chance saloon\u201d for Greece to agree a deal in time for the end of June. Regrettably the meeting is likely to come and go without any deal given that Greek officials have refused to submit any fresh proposals, and Greek Prime Minister is jetting off to Russia to see President Putin, which means we may well get some talks over the weekend. In a sign of how bad things have got the Greek central bank broke with convention and abandoned its neutrality by criticising its incumbent government for the policies it was implementing, in a sign of the fissures opening up in the Greek establishment. Good morning. Finance ministers from across the eurozone are heading to Luxembourg today to discuss Greece, which has less than a fortnight to reach a deal with creditors before its bailout expires. Hopes of a breakthrough are desperately low, though, despite fears of looming capital controls and Greece\u2019s membership of the EU now at stake. Today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting had been inked in as the moment where Europe could rubber stamp a deal; instead, it could be another missed opportunity to make progress. Both sides expect the other to make the next move, to close the gap between the measures Greece is prepared to take in return for bailout aid, and what creditors demand. Athens\u2019 insistence that debt relief is needed - and Europe\u2019s reluctance to address this - mean it could be a short discussion. And without a deal very soon, Greece will simply be unable to repay the IMF the \u20ac1.6bn it owes on June 30. Last night, Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis told ITN News he doesn\u2019t expect a deal today, even though time is desperately short. \u201cThis is the 11th hour.\u201d \u201cThe only sensible proposals on the table at the moment are those that we have tabled. The other side have not come to the party,\u201d The other side, though, insist that it\u2019s Greece\u2019s move in this long-running saga. The meeting takes place this afternoon, but we should hear from ministers through the morning as they make their way to the meeting. We\u2019re also watching out for comments from Angela Merkel this morning, when she addresses MPs in Berlin. We will be tracking all the key developments through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Google is considering teaming up with British private equity firm Permira to launch a bid for the business that runs Tesco\u2019s Clubcard. The US technology firm is believed to be on a longlist of 10 parties considering a bid for Tesco unit Dunnhumby next month. The longlist, whittled down from about 40 approaches to Tesco, will be sent detailed information on Dunnhumby in the next fortnight. First round bids are scheduled to be filed by the end of July, with the company thought to be worth as much as \u00a32bn. Tesco is selling off Dunnhumby as part of its bid to to raise up to \u00a35bn to firm up its balance sheet, in the wake of a collapse in profits and a \u00a3263m accounting scandal last year. Tesco made a \u00a36.4bn annual loss last year \u2013 the biggest ever recorded by a British retailer \u2013 amid a supermarket price war prompted by the rise of discounter supermarkets, such as Aldi and Lidl. The retailer is also weighing up a sale of its Korean chain Homeplus, thought to be worth \u00a34bn, and has already offloaded its Blinkbox film and music streaming businesses. Dunnhumby gathers and analyses data from one billion shoppers around the world each year, and by scrutinising the contents of your shopping trolley it can tell if you are single, a fast-food junkie or a family juggling a tight budget with school-age children. Other parties interested in Dunnhumby are thought to include WPP Group, the marketing services company headed by Sir Martin Sorrell, and Nielsen, the market research firm. A host of private equity firms are also thought to be reviewing a bid, including Apax Partners, Hellman &amp; Friedman, Bain Capital, Blackstone, Advent International, TPG and CVC. In April, Tesco paved the way for the sale of Dunnhumby, which helped develop the supermarket\u2019s Clubcard scheme, by breaking up a joint venture with US retailer. Sources said the dissolution was prompted by the fact that there was a change of control clause in Kroger\u2019s deal with Dunnhumby. Some sources have suggested that the change in the relationship with Kroger, which is now governed by a licence, meant the value of Dunnhumby had dropped dramatically \u2013 to as little as \u00a3600m from the \u00a32bn initially suggested. One source suggested the constant drip feed of information about potential bidders for Dunnhumby was an attempt to drive up the firm\u2019s price after the loss of Kroger. However, the US joint venture prevented Dunnhumby from expanding with other American partners. Some analysts believe the data firm now has more potential. Dave McCarthy, a retail analyst at HSBC, said: \u201cDismantling the Kroger agreement was done deliberately to enhance the long-term potential of the business. While it reduced short-term profits, it increased long-term potential.\u201d Google\u2019s venture capital arm, Google Capital, is thought to be interested in exploiting the data analysis capabilities that have helped Dunnhumby become a leading customer loyalty programme operator, according to Sky News \u2013 which first reported the technology firm\u2019s plans. Its partnership with Permira marks a further step in the two businesses\u2019 relationship, after the private equity firm, which has a specialist technology arm based in Silicon Valley, sold a stake in Renaissance Learning \u2013 an educational data analytics company \u2013 to Google Capital. Google Capital has already invested in SurveyMonkey, an online survey provider, Glassdoor, a recruitment and job-review website and CreditKarma, a website that helps consumer track their credit and finances. Dunnhumby was set up by husband and wife Edwina Dunn and Clive Humby in 1989 in the kitchen of their home in London. It now employs nearly 3,000 people worldwide. The company made a pre-tax profit of \u00a358.7m in the year to 28 February 2014, down from \u00a367.6m a year before, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Sales rose to \u00a3191.5m from \u00a3165.2m in 2013. Tesco bought a stake in the company in 2001, before buying the whole firm. It is thought to be considering both an outright sale and retaining some kind of stake in the business. Any deal is likely to take until at least the end of this year to complete. Next week Tesco will reveal its latest sales performance at its annual shareholder meeting in London. It is also likely to face renewed scrutiny of its dealings with suppliers when the grocery market watchdog holds its annual conference on Monday.",

      "body": "<p>Google is considering teaming up with British private equity firm Permira to launch a bid for the business that runs Tesco\u2019s Clubcard.</p> <p>The US technology firm is believed to be on a longlist of 10 parties considering a bid for Tesco unit Dunnhumby next month.</p> <p>The longlist, whittled down from about 40 approaches to Tesco, will be sent detailed information on Dunnhumby in the next fortnight. First round bids are scheduled to be filed by the end of July, with the company thought to be worth as much as \u00a32bn. </p> <p>Tesco is selling off Dunnhumby as part of its bid to to raise up to \u00a35bn to firm up its balance sheet, in the wake of a collapse in profits and a \u00a3263m accounting scandal last year. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/22/tesco-suffers-record-64bn-loss\">Tesco made a \u00a36.4bn annual loss last year \u2013 the biggest ever recorded by a British retailer</a> \u2013 amid a supermarket price war prompted by the rise of discounter supermarkets, such as Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>The retailer is also weighing up a sale of its Korean chain Homeplus, thought to be worth \u00a34bn, and has already offloaded its Blinkbox film and music streaming businesses.</p> <p>Dunnhumby gathers and analyses data from one billion shoppers around the world each year, and by scrutinising the contents of your shopping trolley it can tell if you are single, a fast-food junkie or a family juggling a tight budget with school-age children.</p> <p>Other parties interested in Dunnhumby are thought to include WPP Group, the marketing services company headed by Sir Martin Sorrell, and Nielsen, the market research firm. </p> <p>A host of private equity firms are also thought to be reviewing a bid, including Apax Partners, Hellman &amp; Friedman, Bain Capital, Blackstone, Advent International, TPG and CVC.</p> <p>In April, Tesco paved the way for the sale of Dunnhumby, which helped develop the supermarket\u2019s Clubcard scheme, by breaking up a joint venture with US retailer. Sources said the dissolution was prompted by the fact that there was a change of control clause in Kroger\u2019s deal with Dunnhumby. </p> <p>Some sources have suggested that the change in the relationship with Kroger, which is now governed by a licence, meant the value of Dunnhumby had dropped dramatically \u2013 to as little as \u00a3600m from the \u00a32bn initially suggested. </p> <p>One source suggested the constant drip feed of information about potential bidders for Dunnhumby was an attempt to drive up the firm\u2019s price after the loss of Kroger.</p> <p>However, the US joint venture prevented Dunnhumby from expanding with other American partners. Some analysts believe the data firm now has more potential.</p> <p>Dave McCarthy, a retail analyst at HSBC, said: \u201cDismantling the Kroger agreement was done deliberately to enhance the long-term potential of the business. While it reduced short-term profits, it increased long-term potential.\u201d<br></p> <p>Google\u2019s venture capital arm, Google Capital, is thought to be interested in exploiting the data analysis capabilities that have helped Dunnhumby become a leading customer loyalty programme operator, according to Sky News \u2013 which first reported the technology firm\u2019s plans.</p> <p>Its partnership with Permira marks a further step in the two businesses\u2019 relationship, after the private equity firm, which has a specialist technology arm based in Silicon Valley, sold a stake in Renaissance Learning \u2013 an educational data analytics company \u2013 to Google Capital.</p> <p>Google Capital has already invested in SurveyMonkey, an online survey provider, Glassdoor, a recruitment and job-review website and CreditKarma, a website that helps consumer track their credit and finances. </p> <p>Dunnhumby was set up by husband and wife Edwina Dunn and Clive Humby in 1989 in the kitchen of their home in London. It now employs nearly 3,000 people worldwide. The company made a pre-tax profit of \u00a358.7m in the year to 28 February 2014, down from \u00a367.6m a year before, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Sales rose to \u00a3191.5m from \u00a3165.2m in 2013.</p> <p>Tesco bought a stake in the company in 2001, before buying the whole firm. It is thought to be considering both an outright sale and retaining some kind of stake in the business. Any deal is likely to take until at least the end of this year to complete.</p> <p>Next week Tesco will reveal its latest sales performance at its annual shareholder meeting in London. It is also likely to face renewed scrutiny of its dealings with suppliers when the grocery market watchdog holds its annual conference on Monday.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There is a beguiling argument that life for Greece outside the eurozone wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Sure, the immediate economic pain would be severe, but a new drachma, coupled with debt default, might deliver a whoosh of relief in time. Isn\u2019t history full of countries that have devalued their way out of crisis by generating an export boom? Didn\u2019t Argentina recover that way when it abandoned its currency peg to the US dollar in 2002? Taken to its logical extreme, this argument says the real threat to the survival of the eurozone is that Greece leaves and prospers. Come the next crisis, other strugglers might opt to quit, dumping their debts as they go. If this idea sounds far-fetched, Jim Leaviss on M&amp;G\u2019s bond team would agree. He makes an excellent case that Greece isn\u2019t Argentina, not by any stretch. Sure, there are parallels between the causes and symptoms of distress \u2013 an overvalued currency, unsustainable debts, shoddy tax collection, dodgy official statistics and high unemployment. But an Argentinian-style cure \u2013 massive devaluation and conversion of bank accounts \u2013 is unlikely to produce the same recovery in Greece, thinks Leaviss. Argentina was lucky with its timing of its devaluation, he argues. Global trade boomed after 2002 as the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates after the 9/11 terrorism attacks and China was welcomed into the world economy. A newly-competitive Argentina increased exports by 120% between 2002 and 2006. It\u2019s hard to imagine Greece copying that performance. Tourism is already 18% of the economy, so probably can\u2019t double as it almost did in Argentina. The poorer quality of the land makes an agricultural boom harder. Greece\u2019s biggest export (surprisingly) is refined petroleum, which is priced in dollars. And its biggest export market is Germany \u2013 \u201cpossibly problematic post a debt default\u201d, notes Leaviss dryly. His common-sense conclusion is that countries that thrived after devaluation (Canada and Sweden are other examples) had trading partners that were growing strongly. \u201cGreece does not have that luxury, nor an economy that can respond quickly to increased export competitiveness,\u201d concludes Leaviss. Note, too, that the Argentinian revival looks less impressive these days with real growth at just 0.5%. They\u2019re all good points, even if life inside the eurozone for Greece is also hellish. A fair wind for Infinis Here\u2019s an investment oddity: a company with a mammoth dividend yield of 9.5% and an intention, which most of its City followers think credible, to keep annual payments to shareholders rising in line with inflation, at a minimum. What\u2019s the catch with Infinis Energy? There are two. First, half its business is onshore wind farms and new energy secretary Amber Rudd supposedly hates the things; yesterday she said she would honour the Conservatives\u2019 pledge to kill current subsidies for onshore wind a year early. Second, the dominant shareholder is Guy Hands\u2019 Terra Firma, which has been saying for six months it might sell its 68.6% stake. These are serious worries \u2013 thus the one-quarter decline in Infinis\u2019s share price since flotation in 2013. But perhaps Rudd\u2019s war on onshore subsidies is not as damaging for Infinis as it seems. She plans to grant a \u201cgrace period\u201d to allow projects with planning permission to proceed. This is not a token concession either. She\u2019s talking \u201cup to 5.2GW\u201d of new on-shore wind capacity, which could mean another 3,000 turbines in the UK, on top of the 5,000 already turning (usually). Infinis\u2019s two big new projects in Scotland, adding 109MW to the company\u2019s current 274MW, should still be OK. Admittedly, there\u2019s a question mark over what Infinis does thereafter. A new contracts for difference subsidy regime arrives in 2017. Will onshore wind get a fair crack? In theory it should: onshore wind is cheaper than offshore variety, letalone grand projects like the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon. Plus, the UK\u2019s renewable energy targets will almost certainly rise after the Paris climate summit in September. On the other hand, it\u2019s hard to know what the government\u2019s plan to give local communities \u201cthe final say\u201d on windfarm applications will mean in practice. The other half of Infinis is unaffected \u2013 it extracts gas from landfill sites to generate electricity. There is little growth in that business since nobody is building new landfill sites, but the cashflows look extremely solid. They are the main source of comfort on the dividend. Cautious investors, understandably, would steer clear of a stock where the main shareholder is eyeing an exit. But, if you think Rudd has thrown only a medium-sized spanner in the turbines, Infinis is an intriguing stock at that dividend yield. Fitbit for the future? Fitbit makes profits \u2013 net income was $132m last year \u2013 so it came to market in better shape than some Wall Street technology flotations. Even so, a 50% surge in the share price on day one, carrying the company\u2019s market value to $6bn, is hard to fathom. The company leads the market for fitness trackers, which probably aren\u2019t a fad. Fitbit is even able to shift its top-of-the-range versions at $250 a pop. But competitors are arriving in droves to this \u201cwearables\u201d market, from Apple to Google to Chinese tech firms. It\u2019s hard to believe profit margins will continue to be so good forever. Fitbit is now worth about six times this year\u2019s expected revenues. Too much, too soon.",

They are the main source of comfort on the dividend.</p> <p>Cautious investors, understandably, would steer clear of a stock where the main shareholder is eyeing an exit. But, if you think Rudd has thrown only a medium-sized spanner in the turbines, Infinis is an intriguing stock at that dividend yield.</p> <h2>Fitbit for the future?</h2> <p>Fitbit makes profits \u2013 net income was $132m last year \u2013 so it came to market in better shape than some Wall Street technology flotations. Even so, a 50% surge in the share price on day one, carrying the company\u2019s market value to $6bn, is hard to fathom.</p> <p>The company leads the market for fitness trackers, which probably aren\u2019t a fad. Fitbit is even able to shift its top-of-the-range versions at $250 a pop. But competitors are arriving in droves to this \u201cwearables\u201d market, from Apple to Google to Chinese tech firms. It\u2019s hard to believe profit margins will continue to be so good forever. Fitbit is now worth about six times this year\u2019s expected revenues. Too much, too soon.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why is a Greek deal so urgent? In theory, Athens has until 30 June \u2013 when it is due to make a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.15bn) payment to the International Monetary Fund \u2013 to secure a fresh injection of cash from its creditors. They have held up the \u20ac7.2bn remaining in its bailout fund, until an agreement on economic reforms can be reached. But it has become increasingly clear that the country\u2019s already fragile financial sector is now suffering a debilitating bank run. A total of \u20ac2bn was withdrawn from Greek banks between Monday and Wednesday this week, as scared savers opt to put their cash under the mattress. That more than swallows up the \u20ac1.1bn increase in emergency funding for Greek banks that the European Central Bank rubberstamped on Wednesday. At this rate, it looks highly unlikely that the banking sector can survive until the end of the month, without either fresh financial support from Greece\u2019s eurozone partners to shore up the banks, or capital controls to stop money flooding out; perhaps both. What happens next? Capital controls \u2013 rules on how much money can be withdrawn from the banks, or taken out of the country \u2013 now look all but inevitable, perhaps within days; much depends on whether they are slapped on by policymakers in Athens, as a desperate attempt to prevent their financial system collapsing, or \u2013 as in Cyprus \u2013 imposed as part of an emergency rescue deal. Unilateral capital controls would effectively put Greece outside the euro, with its currency no longer freely exchangeable on financial markets. If imposed as part of a rescue deal \u2013 which would also have to involve a fresh injection of cash for the banking sector \u2013 they could still be viewed as a temporary measure. So can Athens avoid defaulting on its debts? Only with some kind of new financing agreement: chief negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos has made very clear that Greece cannot make the \u20ac1.6bn payment that is due to the IMF without a new deal on economic reforms; and so far there is little sign of compromise on either side. If default looks likely, Greece would also probably lay plans to start reintroducing its own currency \u2013 the classic road back from default starts with a sharp devaluation. How would the markets react to Grexit? There\u2019s a theory that a Greek default \u2013 and euro-exit \u2013 now looks so likely that it is \u201cpriced in\u201d; but that doesn\u2019t tend to be how financial markets work in reality. If Greece plunges out of the single currency, investors would be likely to react by dumping the sovereign bonds of other peripheral countries, including Portugal and Spain; European shares; and the euro itself. The ECB \u2013 whose chairman Mario Draghi famously calmed markets in 2012 by promising to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to shore up the single currency \u2013 could announce crisis measures, perhaps increasing the value of the ECB\u2019s \u20ac60bn-a-month quantitative easing programme, or even triggering its emergency bond-buying scheme, known as Outright Monetary Transactions, or OMT. And in the long term? Long after the immediate drama has died down, Greek exit from the single currency would change perceptions about the euro project. As Simon Derrick, of BNY Mellon, puts it, \u201cif somebody leaves, it\u2019s no longer a single currency, it\u2019s a fixed-peg exchange rate system.\u201d Next time a country \u2013 Portugal, Spain, Italy \u2013 gets into trouble, the question would immediately become, will they be the next to leave? It could set up a very, very slow domino effect.\u201d",

Poundland\u2019s other major bid to increase the size of its chain \u2013 the planned \u00a355m acquisition of rival 99p stores, is on hold while it is being scrutinised by regulators. The deal would add 251 stores, taking Poundland closer to its goal of building a 1,000-strong chain. Next week, the Competition and Markets Authority will outline the issues it plans to investigate and a final ruling on the merger will come in October. An initial investigation suggested that Poundland would have to close 80 stores in order to meet competition regulations. On Thursday, McCarthy said he believed no such closures would be necessary. \u201c\u201dWith additional evidence and discussions in phase two [the regulator] will understand the compelling reasoning behind the deal,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "A leading energy academic and government adviser has called on ministers to take an equity stake in the planned new Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset, saying it would not make sense to prefer Chinese money. The comments from Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, came as trade union leaders accused the government of letting political beliefs override practical and safety issues in the nuclear sector. In a paper entitled British Energy policy \u2013 What Happens Next? , Helm said the British government should issue debt or specific nuclear guaranteed bonds, that could cut the cost of capital from 10% to 2%. \u201cIt is a no-brainer,\u201d said Helm. \u201cAdd in the military and security issues of letting Chinese state-owned companies into the heart of the British nuclear industry, and it seems positively perverse to prefer Chinese government money to British government money in so sensitive a national project.\u201d Helm usually champions free-market methods and is on the economic advisory committee at the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Meanwhile the attack on government nuclear policy from the GMB union came after comments from Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, left the door open to Chinese state companies building and operating a new plant at Bradwell, in Essex. Gary Smith, the union\u2019s national secretary for energy, said the Conservatives seemed ready to allow Beijing to use its own equipment and supply chain in return for funding the new stations at Bradwell and Hinkley Point. \u201cEnergy policy is a shambles because the government is driven by ideology. It will do anything to bring in private or Chinese state money to build British energy infrastructure rather than have it (debt) on George Osborne\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d he said. This would extend to the Chinese being allowed to ship over large amounts of equipment from Chinese factories, potentially affecting British nuclear safety and as well as hitting UK jobs, he said. Smith noted that an eminent Chinese nuclear scientist, He Zuoxiu, had raised concerns about the safety of his country\u2019s atomic equipment. The comments from the GMB followed a wider BBC Today programme interview with Rudd on the phasing out of wind subsidies. In the interview the energy secretary sidestepped an opportunity to rule out a Chinese-built and operated plant at Bradwell, saying that any new atomic power station would face stringent British safety regulation. A spokesman for the DECC later repeated the line. \u201cAny proposal to build a power station would be subject to the UK regulatory regime. The same goes for components. All of them would have to be scrutinised by the (UK) office for nuclear regulation and not any regulator in any other jurisdiction.\u201d Asked whether this could reduce the heavy involvement of UK factories or workers, the DECC spokesman added: \u201cThat (issue) is some way down the line but the government still wants to maximise opportunities for British manufacturers and the British supply chain.\u201d The latest spat comes amid continuing delays by EDF, the French owner of the Hinkley Point and Bradwell sites, to unveil its list of financial investors to underwrite the \u00a324bn cost of constructing the already-delayed new Hinkley Point C plant. There has been speculation that the Chinese National Nuclear Corporation has been playing hardball, realising that the French company and British government are both desperate for the cash from Beijing. The Chinese are said to be demanding a right to provide components to Hinkley and to be given a green light to build a new station at Bradwell on its own and with a much greater volume of its own equipment. The GMB and some industry sources said Beijing wants to use Britain as a shop window to sell its own nuclear designs and capability around the world. The DECC would not comment on this but denied there was any major worry about the future of Hinkley. \u201cWe are still waiting to finalise the project. EDF is still expecting to start power production in 2023.\u201d",

With the bank still battling to put 600,000 payments into customer accounts that went missing on Wednesday, the bank\u2019s chief administrative officer, Simon McNamara, said he could not make the system failsafe. \u201cI\u2019d love to say we will never have a technical failing again. If you find somebody that tells you that I\u2019ll tell you you\u2019ve found a liar,\u201d said McNamara. \u201cIt is not feasible to run 100% faultless systems\u201d. \u201cTechnology will on occasion fail. If and when that occurs, we need to ensure we can mask the impact on customers and recover as quickly and effectively as possible. It is important that it is handled well and competently,\u201d he said. He was speaking at a seminar about the bank\u2019s IT strategy, which had already been scheduled before the breakdown on Wednesday that left 600,000 customers without payments due in their accounts from wages, tax credits and disability allowances. McNamara acknowledged the timing of the seminar was ironic given the ongoing IT problems. The latest glitch followed an incident in 2012 when 6.5 million customers were locked out their accounts for days. The bank was later fined \u00a356m for the problem with regulators saying it had failed to keep its computer systems up to date despite spending \u00a31bn a year on technology. McNamara said he and his team were disappointed about the current situation. He said it had been caused when RBS, which also owns the NatWest and Ulster brands, was unable to process a file of payments. The underlying issue had been fixed, said McNamara, and lessons learnt from previous IT failures. However, the payments had not yet been put into customers\u2019 accounts. \u201cWe are very close to applying payments to the accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a number of people who are working round the clock, using the skills and tools we have acquired to address this issue,\u201d he said. The bank has already admitted that the sums may not be put into accounts until Saturday. He played down the significance of this week\u2019s problem compared with the incident in 2012, which cost the then boss Stephen Hester his bonus. McNamara joined the bank in 2013 and had said that the problems from 2012 \u2013 which related to \u201cbatch processing\u201d \u2013 would never be repeated. McNamara has been overseeing spending of \u00a3750m over the three years to the end of this year on broader improvements to the bank\u2019s IT. Computer systems are a troublesome area for many banks but particularly for RBS which has had a number of IT systems following its takeover of NatWest 15 years ago. RBS is also trying to create new technology services for customers. McNamara \u2013 who was sporting an Apple Watch at the seminar \u2013 said the bank now had operations in Silicon Valley. Products for the Apple Watch could be launched next month. The bank is also being forced to spin out 315 branches under the Williams &amp; Glyn brand because of the penalties imposed by the EU at the time of its taxpayer bailout. After a series of delays, RBS must do this by September 2016. McNamara is also responsible for overseeing the reduction of RBS\u2019s sprawling office space, shutting down its offices on the Thames in London and in the east of the city in Aldgate. The \u00a3150m annual spending is part of a \u00a33.5bn three-year transformation programme for RBS, which includes refurbishing branches.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sirius Minerals has come under pressure on new doubts about its plans to develop a potash mine in the North York moors national park. The Park Authority has issued a report which - while it makes no recommendation - said the project would be more harmful than beneficial to the local area. The economic benefits and compensation did not outweigh the damage that would be caused, it said: Officers conclude that the policy conflict with the Development Plan and national policy is such that the proposal does not represent Exceptional Circumstances, which is the highest bar that planning policy requires. It is therefore considered that the economic benefits and extent of the mitigation/compensation offered through planning obligations do not outweigh the extent of the harm and clear conflict with the development plan. The report will be presented to a planning committee meeting on 30 June, when a decision whether to go ahead or not will be made. Sirius shares are currently 3.75p or 17% lower at 17.75p, but the company\u2019s managing director Chris Fraser said: We believe the case for approval is very strong because the project represents a once in a generation opportunity. Analysts at RFC Ambrian said: While the report makes no recommendation, and nor was it designed to, its conclusions were not exactly helpful for Sirius. The report concluded that it does not believe the development \u201crepresents exceptional circumstances\u201d. This is very significant as it is key for receiving planning consent within a National Park. What needs to be remembered is that this report\u2019s conclusions are solely from the view point of the Park Authority. Its only interest is the park. There will obviously be a conflict between what the park thinks and the wider interests of North Yorkshire as an economic and social entity. The final decision on the project will be made by a Special Planning Committee; this will meet on 30 June, so there\u2019s not long to go now. And Liberum continues to believe the project will get the go-ahead: Consistent with previous guidance [the authority] has offered a neutral recommendation. As we\u2019ve noted, a neutral recommendation feels most likely to result in a positive vote given the majority of the Park members represent political organisations who\u2019ve previously expressed support for the project. However, today\u2019s release also included some commentary suggesting that the planning committee doesn\u2019t feel the project represents the exceptional circumstances required for development. For us, there is no change to our view that approval is the most likely outcome as we\u2019ve previously noted that the planning committee was likely to place more weight on the park\u2019s preservation and its official recommendation remains neutral.",

It is therefore considered that the economic benefits and extent of the mitigation/compensation offered through planning obligations do not outweigh the extent of the harm and clear conflict with the development plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report will be presented to a planning committee meeting on 30 June, when a decision whether to go ahead or not will be made.</p> <p>Sirius shares are currently 3.75p or 17% lower at 17.75p, but the company\u2019s managing director Chris Fraser said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We believe the case for approval is very strong because the project represents a once in a generation opportunity.</p> </blockquote> <p>Analysts at RFC Ambrian said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the report makes no recommendation, and nor was it designed to, its conclusions were not exactly helpful for Sirius. </p> <p>The report concluded that it does not believe the development \u201crepresents exceptional circumstances\u201d. This is very significant as it is key for receiving planning consent within a National Park. </p> <p>What needs to be remembered is that this report\u2019s conclusions are solely from the view point of the Park Authority. Its only interest is the park. There will obviously be a conflict between what the park thinks and the wider interests of North Yorkshire as an economic and social entity. The final decision on the project will be made by a Special Planning Committee; this will meet on 30 June, so there\u2019s not long to go now. </p> </blockquote> <p>And Liberum continues to believe the project will get the go-ahead:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consistent with previous guidance [the authority] has offered a neutral recommendation. As we\u2019ve noted, a neutral recommendation feels most likely to result in a positive vote given the majority of the Park members represent political organisations who\u2019ve previously expressed support for the project.</p> <p>However, today\u2019s release also included some commentary suggesting that the planning committee doesn\u2019t feel the project represents the exceptional circumstances required for development.</p> <p>For us, there is no change to our view that approval is the most likely outcome as we\u2019ve previously noted that the planning committee was likely to place more weight on the park\u2019s preservation and its official recommendation remains neutral.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3c0d4c512b1cef6cacd69e291cbb49f40dc8132\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434637137265/0ccf1c48-4fa4-4627-82f1-cccc0717bb83-460x318.png\" alt=\"Proposed potash project\" width=\"460\" height=\"318\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Proposed potash project</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "After all the shouting, are we any closer to knowing whether free trade agreements are good or bad for the country \u2013 and for your wallet? The attempts to provide answers to those questions have been thrust into the spotlight by President Barack Obama\u2019s futile last-minute efforts to salvage his power to freely negotiate what would be the world\u2019s largest free trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In the eyes of those within his own party, including the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, free trade agreements have been disastrous for ordinary Americans, hurting their wages, eroding the health of entire manufacturing sectors and putting the United States at a disadvantage against countries that engage in underhand trade practices. Their success last week managed to strip Obama of fast-track negotiating authority, pushing him into an unusual partnership with congressional Republicans in an effort to find a way to rescue the package of legislation by restructuring it. If you thought the political battle over Obamacare was high drama, just wait until Obamatrade really gets going. All the participants in these high-stakes congressional battles argue that they have based their positions on what they believe is in the best interests of ordinary Americans. The president pitches TPP as a win-win: US companies will find new export markets, he argues, while export-dependent countries like Vietnam end up paying higher wages than average (the treaty also contains new labor standards that Vietnam and other low-wage countries would have to abide by). It\u2019s also strategically important for the United States to coordinate some kind of free trade zone, seizing the initiative from Asia\u2019s dominant power, China. Opponents, meanwhile, point to what they argue is a pattern of job losses and wage declines at home following free trade agreements. Those who have read the still-secret document voice concerns about everything from the dispute resolution process to environmental protection rules. A draft version of the trade pact posted by WikiLeaks opened up the prospect that pharmaceutical companies might be able to challenge the prices that national health authorities, including Medicare, pay for drugs. Meanwhile, the whole debate is complicated by the fact that the TPP draft is a work in progress, and thus is being kept secret. If you want to read it, you\u2019re out of luck. So giving the president fast-track negotiating authority would have been a giant leap of faith on the part of Congress. Which brings me to my main point. Negotiating a free trade agreement is always going to involve a leap of faith \u2013 a leap of faith in the future. There is no way, even if someone took up WikiLeaks\u2019 $100,000 offer for a leaked copy of the full 29 chapters of the draft treaty as it stands today, that it would be possible to gauge just what its impact would be on Americans today, a decade from now, or 25 years down the road. Not, that is, without a fully functional crystal ball. There are simply far too many variables involved, and too many \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d. Consider the US-South Korea free trade agreement, completed in 2010 and in effect from 2012. Far from helping US exports to South Korea to climb, they have fallen as imports from South Korea have risen, causing the trade deficit to widen. The problem with those who try to draw conclusions about free trade agreements in general from this example, however, is twofold. Firstly, it covers the experience of only about two years: an absurdly short time frame. Secondly, economic growth rates in South Korea peaked in 2010, the year the free trade pact was negotiated and all those rosy forecasts about US exports were drawn up. Right now, however, the economic picture looks bleak, and it\u2019s probably fair to say that few expected that would happen. Trade volumes look fine, but the value of that trade isn\u2019t what it should be; the country\u2019s central bank is slashing interest rates to weaken the value of the Korean won, making those exports cheaper and bolstering domestic demand. Even before the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) crisis hit the country, taking (at last count) 15 lives and proving a further drag on the economy, the International Monetary Fund had already cut its estimates for Korea\u2019s 2015 growth. It\u2019s fairly hard to realize the full benefits of an agreement with a trading partner whose economy has just run into a wall. The picture gets even more muddled if you try to look at the grandaddy of all free trade agreements, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. Signed by Canada, the US and Mexico in 1992, Nafta was a model for many of the large trade agreements that followed, including TPP; it also was one of the first free trade pacts between economies with varying standards of living, labor standards and other business and environmental rules. Critics argue that by 2010, a total of 682,900 jobs had been lost to Mexico, on a net basis. Of these, 415,000 were manufacturing jobs, many of which paid healthy living wages. Meanwhile, a small trade surplus with Mexico had become a deficit by 2000. Except \u2026 it wasn\u2019t all that simple. Had those jobs not gone to Mexico, would they have stayed in the United States? Not necessarily, suggested Mauro Guill\u00e9n, a management professor at the Wharton School of Business; they might well have ended up in China. Meanwhile, some of the products made in Mexico are still being designed in the United States, he has noted. In 1995, the year after Nafta took effect, Mexico had its own financial crisis, causing the value of the peso to nosedive and triggering a recession. As is the case with South Korea today, events that had nothing to do with the free trade agreement itself ended up causing a big drop in Mexican imports from the United States. The timing, however, made it appear as if the trade deficit was tied to free trade \u2013 but correlation isn\u2019t causation. More recently, US demand for crude oil produced by Mexico, and the high prices for crude, sent that trade deficit higher again. Once again, that imbalance had nothing to do with free trade and everything to do with a supply/demand imbalance for crude oil within the United States. There\u2019s a real source of concern here \u2013 the fact that American incomes have continued to stagnate in the period since Nafta kicked off the negotiation of free trade agreements. Again, however, correlation isn\u2019t causation. The biggest culprits may include technology that has made it easier for workers in low-wage countries like China to do jobs that were once done here in the United States \u2013 or the policies of companies with respect to how they treat their work force. Apple already can choose to make its products in China, Vietnam or the United States. Their choice is clear. David Autor, an economist at MIT, argues that it is the spike in global trade, not free trade agreements, that has led to this result; he calculates that imports from China (not party to any free trade agreement with the United States) are responsible for 21% of the plunge in American manufacturing. None of this means that the TPP is certain to be a great idea \u2013 or a bad one. Folks like the president and David Autor may argue all they like in favor of the pact, suggesting that it will give us an edge against China and, by protecting our intellectual property, help us expand our exports of computer services. Critics can charge that it will be a disaster, costing millions of jobs, accelerating climate change and doing untold damage to everything from our access to healthcare to worker\u2019s rights. The fact remains that even if we opened the vaults, distributed copies of the draft treaty and settled down to a great national debate about what it means, we simply wouldn\u2019t know for certain. Yes, we could indulge in some scenario analyses, but given the squabbling among economists over which models to use and how to calculate the benefits and losses, and the difficulty in reaching a consensus on Nafta\u2019s impact 23 years after it came into effect, I\u2019m not sure that would prove all that helpful. The president may not want to admit it \u2013 and he may not believe it himself \u2013 but we simply can\u2019t tell what this is all going to mean for us. It\u2019s a roll of the dice.",

In a parliamentary speech she said that although Greece had received \u201cunprecedented help from its partners\u201d, it had failed to honour commitments it made to lenders. She quoted from agreements Athens had signed earlier this year, saying they had been broken. In an atypically rowdy session of the Bundestag on Thursday, with Merkel receiving both applause and jeers as she spoke, the chancellor stressed that Germany would like to see Greece stay in the eurozone. \u201cIt remains the case that Germany\u2019s efforts are concentrated on keeping Greece in the eurozone,\u201d she said. By praising countries such as Spain, Portugal and Ireland, which she said with the help of other partners and their own efforts, had got \u201cback on their feet\u201d, she expressed her disapproval of Greece\u2019s attitude. \u201cThese countries used their chances,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the economic and monetary union, self-reliance and solidarity go hand in hand.\u201d But she said a last-minute deal which would help Greece to secure an agreement with its creditors, the EU, the IMF and the ECB, was still a possibility. \u201cI\u2019m still convinced where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way,\u201d she said. \u201cIf those in charge of Greece can mobilise the will, an agreement with the three institutions is still possible.\u201d Gregor Gysi, of the far-left Die Linke (the Left party), accused Merkel\u2019s grand coalition of \u201ctotal failure\u201d in its handling of the Greek crisis. \u201cYou are endangering the euro ... and with that European integration,\u201d he told parliament. Gysi said the Greek government had inherited a financial \u201cmess\u201d from his social democrat and conservative predecessors, but had nevertheless managed to repay a total of \u20ac7bn (\u00a35bn) of debt to creditors. \u201cThe Greek government is prepared to save \u2013 but just not there where you would like them to,\u201d Gysi said, pointing a finger at Merkel and her finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. If Greece defaults, Germany, as the biggest contributor to the EU\u2019s financial bailouts, stands to lose billions of euros.",

Gysi said the Greek government had inherited a financial \u201cmess\u201d from his social democrat and conservative predecessors, but had nevertheless managed to repay a total of \u20ac7bn (\u00a35bn) of debt to creditors.</p> <p>\u201cThe Greek government is prepared to save \u2013 but just not there where you would like them to,\u201d Gysi said, pointing a finger at Merkel and her finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.</p> <p>If Greece defaults, Germany, as the biggest contributor to the EU\u2019s financial bailouts, stands to lose billions of euros.</p>",

The volume of retail sales rose 0.2% in May following strong growth of 0.9% in April, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. Clothes sales fell 1.6% between April and May, the biggest drop since September. The weather played its part, with the April figures boosted by warm weather, while last month was cooler than usual, deterring shoppers from buying summer clothes. However, supermarkets and other food stores enjoyed strong sales, amid an ongoing price war. Food sales rose 0.6%, the biggest increase since December. The figures also showed that average store prices, including at petrol stations, fell by 2.7% in May from a year earlier, marking the 11th month of year-on-year price falls. The biggest contribution came from petrol stations. Chris Williamson, chief economist at economic survey firm Markit, said: \u201cRetail sales growth slowed in May after a sunshine-related burst of spending in April, but the underlying trend remains impressively strong and adds to the likelihood of interest rates rising later this year rather than being delayed until 2016.\u201c Of every pound spent at retailers in May, 41p was spent in food stores; 42p in non-food stores; 10p at petrol stations; and 7p online and via mail order. The ONS said that in recent months, the quantity bought in the food sector has increased and while average store prices have fallen, the amount spent has stayed flat. \u201cThe underlying trend looks healthy,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at research group IHS Global Insight. \u201cThis maintains hopes that decent consumer spending can underpin significantly improved GDP [gross domestic product] growth in the second quarter.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government has released a $1.2bn plan to make northern Australia an \u201ceconomic powerhouse\u201d, which includes greater temporary migration and expediting native title claims. The white paper on developing northern Australia also recommends that the federal government cede part of its responsibilities on Indigenous cultural heritage, by accrediting state and territory schemes. The plan, unveiled by 14 north Australian Coalition MPs on Thursday, includes a chapter on \u201csimplifying\u201d land arrangements in the north. It notes that large sections of Australia\u2019s north are Indigenous land holdings or covered under native title. \u201cSome of the rules governing land use in the north adversely affect economic development and discourage investment,\u201d the paper says. It wants all existing native title claims finalised within a decade, and a quicker process for future claims, partially by giving courts the power to determine whether native title exists where an Indigenous company holds a pastoral lease. The federal government will set aside $110m a year for four years to expedite native title claims and another $20.4m to help stakeholders initiate discussions with potential investors. \u201cI fully understand the passion of Indigenous people to maintain control of their land,\u201d the prime minister, Tony Abbott, said. \u201cBut you only have to talk to Indigenous people in Cape York or east Arnhem Land to know that they also want to secure a better economic future for themselves and for their families.\u201d The Northern Territory chief minister, Adam Giles, said unlocking the \u201cpotential\u201d of native title land was key to the territory\u2019s success. \u201cThis is great news for both Aboriginal people, who are seeking a real economic future, and business who want to pursue opportunities ranging from aquaculture to tourism on Aboriginal land,\u201d he said. Labor senator Nova Peris disagrees, saying the white paper \u201cputs the interests of investors ahead of Aboriginal people\u201d. The Commonwealth wants to implement amendments to the Heritage Protection Act to essentially hand over control of heritage decisions to state and territory governments. \u201cThe government will consult Indigenous Australians and industry on possible amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to reduce duplication in the heritage protection regimes across jurisdictions, while safeguarding decision-making powers for traditional owners,\u201d the report says. \u201cThis includes considering the establishment of a system to accredit appropriate state and territory Indigenous heritage protection regimes, thus reducing the potential for regulatory duplication once Commonwealth requirements and standards are met.\u201d The 190-page white paper aims to boost the economic prosperity of Australia\u2019s northern regions. It features a cash injection of $600m for road projects and $5m for freight projects, on top of a $5bn scheme for concessional loans already announced in the May budget. The live cattle export trade will get a $100m funding boost, partly through the improvement of roads that service the supply chain. $200m will be set aside for a water infrastructure fund and a further $20m on the feasibility of dams and infrastructure projects in northern Australia, including the third stage of the Ord river venture. Previous attempts to turn the Ord into a food bowl have yielded poor results. Abbott told parliament on Thursday that Australia for too long has had a \u201cdam phobia\u201d. Earlier in the day, he told reporters: \u201cThis [white paper] is not just a statement of principle in favour of dams. This is putting money where our mouth is.\u201d The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has welcomed the funding boost. \u201cLack of access to water is a major constraint on economic growth in northern Australia, and building dams to strengthen irrigation and agricultural production is key to the solution,\u201d director of economics John Osborn said. \u201cWe must not allow ideological opposition to dams to hold back development.\u201d Money will also be pumped into trade and tourism, as a way of attracting investment in the region, including $2.5m for fostering business links with Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it. The north\u2019s time has come. For decades [the potential] has been obvious to so many people, especially those in the north,\u201d trade minister Andrew Robb told reporters at the unveiling of the paper on Thursday. Visas for Indian and Chinese visitors will be fast-tracked, and a visa valid for ten-years will be trialled for Chinese visitors. The Commonwealth is working with Western Australia on arrangements allowing non-mining-sector employers to advertise overseas for workers to fill labour market shortages. A similar arrangement came into play in the Northern Territory in February 2014. People in Australia who are employed in sectors such as agriculture, tourism and aged-care under holiday visas will be eligible to work in Australia longer if they base themselves in the north. \u201cI am very happy with the relaxation of visas. We are basically fast-tracking and giving some preference to people who do make a commitment to working in the north,\u201d Robb said. The prime minister did not put a cap on the number of foreign workers that could come to Australia under the new arrangements. \u201cIf people are prepared to work in northern Australia, we want to make them welcome. So provided you are prepared to work in northern Australia, some of the conditions on some visas will be relaxed,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cBut I do want to make it absolutely crystal clear that people who come into Australia will be working in accordance with standard Australian wages and conditions.\u201d A cap on the number of people participating in the seasonal worker scheme, a program that trains and employs workers from Timor-Leste and nearby Pacific nations, will be removed entirely. The seasonal workers program, currently limited to the agricultural sector, will be expanded, and a trial of the program in the tourism sector will be rolled out from 1 July.",

      "bodyText": "Since the mid-1990s the Reserve Bank of Australia has been independent from government, and recently it has been highlighting that independence. Numerous statements and speeches by the executive of the RBA have noted how monetary and fiscal policy are now working against each other. Monetary policy has been working as expected, fighting against a headwind of government cuts to spending. It looks clear the RBA would like this to change. With interest rates at record lows, many economists and even the governor of the RBA, Glenn Stevens, have noted the diminishing returns of monetary policy. In essence the worry is that, while cutting interest rates from 7% to 5% might encourage people and businesses to invest, there are fewer people or businesses who would not invest at 3% but would if the cash rate was cut to 2%. In February Glenn Stevens told the House economics committee that the RBA was concerned that \u201cmonetary policy\u2019s power simply to summon up more demand with lower interest rates could be less than it used to be.\u201d He did not, however, think monetary policy was useless. He suggested the bank did not believe \u201cthat monetary policy has reached the stage where it has no ability at all to give additional support to demand in the economy\u201d. The RBA still felt it \u201chas some ability to do that and to assist the transition the economy is making, and we regarded it as appropriate to provide that support\u201d. It now appears the recent ability of monetary policy to stimulate the economy has been as strong as ever. This week a speech by the RBA\u2019s assistant governor, Christopher Kent, revealed that according to the bank\u2019s analysis, monetary policy is working about as effectively as it did in the past. He noted the historical assumption is that cutting the cash rate by 100 basis points (i.e. 1 percentage point) will lead GDP to be higher than otherwise by about 0.5% to 0.75% over the course of two years. Such a cut would also cause inflation to rise by \u201csomewhat less than 0.25 percentage points per annum over 2\u20133 years\u201d. From November 2011 to May 2013, the RBA cut the cash rate by 200 basis points, from 4.75% to 2.75%. Since then it has cut it another 75 basis points to its current rate of 2.0%. The RBA\u2019s research, according to Kent, suggests that \u201cthe overall effect of monetary policy has not changed significantly in recent years\u201d. That we are currently experiencing such low growth does not, in Kent\u2019s view, mean monetary policy is not working as well as it should, but that there have been a number of large \u201cexogenous forces or shocks\u201d \u2013 that is, negative impacts outside the control of monetary policy. Kent noted these negative shocks included \u201cthe sharp fall in commodity prices\u201d and also \u201cweakness in private investment \u2013 beyond that which can be explained by subdued domestic demand and falling commodity prices\u201d. Among the areas Kent pointed to which demonstrated the ongoing effectiveness of monetary policy was housing construction. The mass of discussion about a house price boom in Sydney clearly has shown that cutting rates has had an impact. But the RBA is more concerned about the impact on housing construction. If all low interest rates are doing is raising housing prices, then it is doing little good. But the growth in construction since the RBA began cutting rates in November 2011 shows there has been a clear impact: So, while there have been shocks to the economy, monetary policy has had an impact, but the RBA has been quite vocal of late to let it be known that it feels like it is doing all the work. When announcing the interest rate decision in the first week of June, the governor\u2019s statement noted, after highlighting the weak levels of private demand, \u201cpublic spending is also scheduled to be subdued\u201d. The minutes of the June monetary policy meeting also noted that the bank was not just looking at the federal government but also the \u201cthe fiscal positions of the states and territories\u201d when it came to assessing \u201cthe effect of fiscal consolidation on the aggregate economy\u201d. And then last week, Glenn Stevens told the Economics Society of Australia that economic growth was weaker than the RBA had previously hoped it would be. He suggested that \u201cthe most recent indications are for, if anything, a weakening over the year ahead\u201d. He followed this statement by immediately noting that \u201cpublic final spending has not been growing and fiscal consolidation still has some way to run\u201d. On this he provided some rather pointed advice to federal and state governments, arguing that given the current weak growth in the economy, \u201cit would seem inappropriate for governments to seek additional restraint here in the near term\u201d. One of the reasons we have low interest rates is because governments have not been spending in a manner which would provide greater stimulus to the economy. The latest growth figures on government consumption shows just how low it is currently: Now, to an extent that\u2019s fine. Indeed it\u2019s a choice. During the global financial crisis, Joe Hockey argued government spending should have been lower so as to have allowed interest rates to be lower. Now he argues that the government is creating room for the RBA to cut rates. But the bank is increasingly seeing the government working against what the RBA is trying to do. In his speech, Christopher Kent listed \u201cfiscal consolidation at state and federal levels\u201d along with \u201cthe significant decline in mining investment\u201d as one of the \u201cheadwinds\u201d against which monetary policy is working. He also noted that while monetary policy is working well in spite of these headwinds, one issue was that \u201cconsumption growth has been a bit weaker than in the past\u201d. Certainly, when we look away from housing, the spending patterns don\u2019t look to have reacted as strongly. The latest motor vehicles sales figures show the growth of sales of new cars seems to have peaked \u2013 and peaked at a very low annual growth of 2.3%: Thus demand in the economy remains weak, and non-housing spending is sluggish. For most of the past three years the desire to restrain government spending had meant that most of the work to keep the economy ticking along has been up to the Reserve Bank. The RBA believes monetary policy has thus far been working as expected. But the record low interest rates that have resulted from the RBA stimulating the economy have also brought with them the risks that occur when there is an abundance of cheap money \u2013 worries about a housing bubble and risky investment lending. The need to keep the exchange rate low (one of the other headwinds Kent spoke of) means the RBA will remain open to cutting rates further. However, when the RBA governor is warning governments against any more fiscal \u201crestraint\u201d, it\u2019s clear the bank is feeling a bit like Lebron James in the NBA finals \u2013 the one doing all the work. It\u2019s also clear that without more of a hand from governments \u2013 via fiscal stimulus \u2013 it believes the current period of low growth will continue.",

Now he argues that the government is creating room for the RBA to cut rates. </p> <p>But the bank is increasingly seeing the government working against what the RBA is trying to do. </p> <p>In his speech, Christopher Kent listed \u201cfiscal consolidation at state and federal levels\u201d along with \u201cthe significant decline in mining investment\u201d as one of the \u201cheadwinds\u201d against which monetary policy is working. </p> <p>He also noted that while monetary policy is working well in spite of these headwinds, one issue was that \u201cconsumption growth has been a bit weaker than in the past\u201d.</p> <p>Certainly, when we look away from housing, the spending patterns don\u2019t look to have reacted as strongly. The latest motor vehicles sales figures show the growth of sales of new cars seems to have peaked \u2013 and peaked at a very low annual growth of 2.3%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uFjcr/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Thus demand in the economy remains weak, and non-housing spending is sluggish. </p> <p>For most of the past three years the desire to restrain government spending had meant that most of the work to keep the economy ticking along has been up to the Reserve Bank. </p> <p>The RBA believes monetary policy has thus far been working as expected. But the record low interest rates that have resulted from the RBA stimulating the economy have also brought with them the risks that occur when there is an abundance of cheap money \u2013 worries about a housing bubble and risky investment lending.</p> <p>The need to keep the exchange rate low (one of the other headwinds Kent spoke of) means the RBA will remain open to cutting rates further. However, when the RBA governor is warning governments against any more fiscal \u201crestraint\u201d, it\u2019s clear the bank is feeling a bit like Lebron James in the NBA finals \u2013 the one doing all the work. </p> <p>It\u2019s also clear that without more of a hand from governments \u2013 via fiscal stimulus \u2013 it believes the current period of low growth will continue. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Anto\u0301nio Horta-Oso\u0301rio, the boss of Lloyds Banking Group, will on Thursday tell his fellow bankers to stop complaining about the wave of regulatory changes being imposed on the industry. Amid complaints from rivals about the ringfence that banks must erect between their high street and investment banking arms, Horta-Oso\u0301rio will say: \u201cRingfencing is happening. The industry should accept this and move on.\u201d \u201cThe principle behind it is right, that is to minimise the possibility of the failure of a bank being again a burden on the British taxpayer,\u201d he will say. The ringfence was a key part of the recommendations by the Vickers Commission and must be implemented by 2019. It is one of a series of regulatory changes that HSBC is expected to consider in determining whether to remain headquartered in London. HSBC has already said its ringfenced bank will be based in Birmingham and indicated it could reintroduce the Midland name on the high street. \u201cTo people who say ringfencing is too burdensome, I would simply say that having an effective ringfence can, over time, reduce the level of capital required in the banking sector,\u201d said Horta-Osorio. The impact on Lloyds from the ringfence is minimal and Horta-Oso\u0301rio will address the topic at a conference at the British Bankers\u2019 Association on Thursday. The BBA has been calling for a review of the taxation on the banking system, particularly the bank levy, which is also key to HSBC\u2019s decision to review whether to keep its HQ in London. At a meeting earlier this week, Anthony Browne, the boss of the BBA, hit out against the levy, which has been increased nine times since 2010. He said that the chief executive of a foreign, global bank had told him that the UK government was \u201cacting like an African dictator\u201d. Browne added: \u201cYou might think that goes too far \u2013 and I understand why this tax is good politics. But it does show the negative impression the UK government is creating in board rooms in America and Asia.\u201d Horta-Oso\u0301rio will also acknowledge the impact fines have on customer trust. He had \u00a3350,000 docked from his bonus after Lloyds was fined \u00a3117m for mishandling compensation claims for payment protection insurance. \u201cA succession of revelations about past practices has rocked our industry to its core. \u201cPPI and interest rate swaps misselling and Libor and foreign exchange manipulation have all taken their toll \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 on the relationship between banks, their customers and society at large,\u201d he will say. \u201cThe regulation burden will only stop growing once the public and regulators trust us to manage our sector in a responsible manner.\u201d.",
