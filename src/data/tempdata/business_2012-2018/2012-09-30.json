      "bodyText": "Businesses are growing in confidence about the prospects for growth in the run up to Christmas, according to a survey of UK firms by Lloyds Bank. But separate surveys pointed to pressure on pay, particularly among manufacturers. A monthly snapshot of sentiment among Lloyds business customers found that optimism was at its highest since July 2011. The monthly barometer for September showed that 51% were more optimistic about their prospects than the previous month, with only 8% less optimistic. The survey supports recent economic data that points to a modest reversal in the UK's fortunes over the summer. Official figures showed the services sector, which accounts for more than three quarters of output, grew by 1.1% in July. Recent surveys of the manufacturing industry point to a recovery in recent months and stable investment trends that show businesses are in a more expansionary mood. Lloyds said the general mood was lifted by central bank policy measures in Europe, the US and Japan. Trevor Williams, the chief economist of Lloyds Bank Wholesale Banking &amp; Markets, said: \"A big jump in manufacturing output in August alongside continuing gains in employment support the rise in the barometer. \"Policy makers in the UK will likely continue to focus on underlying economic trends which our survey shows is consistent with the latest MPC minutes' suggestion of \"modest underlying expansion,\" he added. Regionally, businesses improved in the Midlands, south and north, Lloyds found. The Bank of England meets this week to consider cutting interest rates and increasing quantitative easing from the current total of \u00a3375bn. Many economists believe the Bank will follow the lead set by the US Federal Reserve and increase QE, possibly to \u00a3425bn, though not at least until November. A report by the accountants Deloitte said the retailing sector was also picking itself up after a rocky year. It found the number of retailers falling into administration in the third quarter of this year fell by 15% to 28 compared with 33 in the same period last year. The reports chimed with a separate survey showing the jobs market had picked up significantly since last year \u2013 but the improvement came with pressure on pay reflecting an increase in part time, temporary and freelance positions. The monthly Reed job index showed job opportunities in September 2012 were up by 11% compared with the same month last year. Every region enjoyed jobs growth, with the East Midlands, North West and North East seeing the biggest increase in new opportunities. Martin Warnes, managing director at reed.co.uk, said: \"The wider picture is one of a steadying jobs market. In a number of regions that were among the hardest hit by the recession, the prospects for jobseekers are far rosier than they were this time last year. While the prospects for employment are improved, the index shows that salaries on offer have slipped back, with more part-time, temporary and freelance jobs affecting the overall picture. The EEF, meanwhile, which represents manufacturers, said manufacturers were still facing a tough time and many were imposing wage freezes. A survey of companies for the three months to the end of August showed one in seven firms had frozen pay against one in nine in the three months to the end of June. In addition to the number of freezes, more companies agreed lower settlements, with one third below 2% and four fifths below 3%. The average pay settlement for the period was 2.4% against 2.5% in the previous survey.",

They're looking for businesses they trust to do the right thing, at the right price,\" he will say.</p> <p>Sainsbury's has invested in new one-stop recycling facilities at its stores in recent months, established plans for geothermal heat pump technology at 100 outlets and installed 70,000 solar panels at 169 of its retail units.</p> <p>It already claims to be the largest user of anaerobic digestion \u2013 or waste to energy \u2013 and has stopped sending food waste to landfill, as part of its 20 sustainability targets to be achieved by 2020.</p> <p>On Wednesday, when Tesco will report its first fall in profits for nearly 20 years, King is expected to announce a 1.4% increase in second-quarter like-for-like sales at Sainsbury's.</p> <p>He is convinced the credit crunch does not have to mean a race to the bottom on food prices. \"The idea that people who've got less, care less, is out of touch with how people really feel and behave, and totally misjudges the British public. Our research shows similar attitudes across socio-economic groups. It's one reason why we have Marine Stewardship Council certification for our basics fishfingers as well as over 100 other product lines,\" he will say.</p> <p>King already believes Sainsbury's has scored a significant victory this summer by highlighting its agreement with dairy farmers to pay a fair price of 30p per litre of milk as Morrisons, Asda and others faced protests for allegedly trying to drive their prices down to 24p .</p> <p>On Monday, the group will give details of the \u00a31m agriculture and development grant to underline its desire to work more closely with local producers.</p> <p>Jim Woods, the founder of Green Mondays, has praised King for being willing to \"go naked\" and allow himself to be questioned on all aspects of the company's sustainability performance by a range of experts.</p> <p>King is convinced he already has a proud record which includes a 9% reduction in carbon emissions over the last four years at a time when store space has increased by 25%.</p> <p>King is also determined to fight claims that supermarkets are responsible for rundown high streets: \"No one has done more to reinvigorate the high streets in the UK than supermarkets in the last five years and nobody more than us \u2026 As regularly as I get letters saying: 'Please don't open your shop in our town.' I get letters saying: 'Thank heavens you did. It has completely regenerated our town.'\"</p> <p>King cites an example of a new store for Barnes, South London. About 4,000 people including local MP Zac Goldsmith signed a petition against it.</p> <p>\"Something like 20,000 people a week visit that store and I think you will find a number of the local traders are now publicly saying they were misguided in their fears and actually it has been the making of their business or the saving of it ,\" he said. \"Go and ask the people of Tottenham about the investment which we have already made \u2026 We have to get better at telling the story and hopefully you have to get better at reporting it,\" he said.</p> <p>He also said it was \"ludicrous\" to claim that food prices were much higher than they used to be and that supermarket supply chains that involve trucking around the country were not efficient.</p> <p>\"Food is cheaper than it ever has been. Of course when you are sitting here today and the price has gone up compared to last week then that is real inflation and customers really feel the pinch in their weekly grocery shop. [But] the idea that food is expensive is ludicrous.</p> <p>\"Food and groceries more generally make up a smaller proportion of a household budget today than they have ever done in the history of this country and yet the food we are able to choose is more varied, more international, more healthy and safer than ever.\"</p> <p>As for distribution, King said critics forget that if we all only ate food grown within 10 miles of where we lived we would not be eating a very varied or indeed healthy and safe diet.</p> <p>He said: \"The way our supply chains work is they are incredibly efficient in their consumption of resource in terms of ultimately connecting the end consumer with the production. We want to run our vehicles over as short a distance as possible because fuel, vehicles and driver time are incredibly expensive. So there is no disconnect between the economic imperative to run them efficiently and the society imperative of something which is sustainable in carbon and energy terms.\"</p> <p>All the prejudices don't bear up to scrutiny. The reality is the supply chains we operate, particularly in the UK, are the most efficient on the planet.\"</p> <p>Asked whether Mary Portas's mission for the government to mend the high street was moving in the right direction, King said: \"The central thesis of Mary's which we have no problem with is that high streets will succeed if they are better, more vibrant places for people to go. Success breeds success. You are not going to save \u2013 if that is the right term \u2013 high streets by stopping, or trying to stop, other people from competing.</p> <p>\"The reasons for customers shopping in the shops they currently shop in is because many of the options they have are distinctly undesirable. So what will attract vibrant high streets is investment that make that attractive destinations. And of course it is a misrepresentation to suggest somehow supermarkets are not. We have around 600 supermarkets, around 200 are in what you or I would call a high street. Probably no one has done more to reinvigorate the high streets in the UK than supermarkets in the last five years and nobody more than us. Certainly every single one of our stores is reinvigorating the location it is in.\"</p> <p>Although Portas's report, published last December, attacked the rapacious growth of the supermarkets,she said at the time she saw little scope to bring about change in this area: \"I would stop it [supermarket expansion]. But to a certain extent the horse has bolted . We have let supermarkets do this and they have. The only way we can fight it is to create something different.\"</p> <p>Portas said this weekend she was writing to David Cameron to urgently pursue her recommendations on reviving the high street, fearing government support for her programme had dried up.</p>",

It already claims to be the largest user of anaerobic digestion \u2013 or waste to energy \u2013 and has stopped sending food waste to landfill, as part of its 20 sustainability targets to be achieved by 2020. On Wednesday, when Tesco will report its first fall in profits for nearly 20 years, King is expected to announce a 1.4% increase in second-quarter like-for-like sales at Sainsbury's. He is convinced the credit crunch does not have to mean a race to the bottom on food prices. \"The idea that people who've got less, care less, is out of touch with how people really feel and behave, and totally misjudges the British public. Our research shows similar attitudes across socio-economic groups. It's one reason why we have Marine Stewardship Council certification for our basics fishfingers as well as over 100 other product lines,\" he will say. King already believes Sainsbury's has scored a significant victory this summer by highlighting its agreement with dairy farmers to pay a fair price of 30p per litre of milk as Morrisons, Asda and others faced protests for allegedly trying to drive their prices down to 24p . On Monday, the group will give details of the \u00a31m agriculture and development grant to underline its desire to work more closely with local producers. Jim Woods, the founder of Green Mondays, has praised King for being willing to \"go naked\" and allow himself to be questioned on all aspects of the company's sustainability performance by a range of experts. King is convinced he already has a proud record which includes a 9% reduction in carbon emissions over the last four years at a time when store space has increased by 25%. King is also determined to fight claims that supermarkets are responsible for rundown high streets: \"No one has done more to reinvigorate the high streets in the UK than supermarkets in the last five years and nobody more than us \u2026 As regularly as I get letters saying: 'Please don't open your shop in our town.' I get letters saying: 'Thank heavens you did. It has completely regenerated our town.'\" King cites an example of a new store for Barnes, South London. About 4,000 people including local MP Zac Goldsmith signed a petition against it. \"Something like 20,000 people a week visit that store and I think you will find a number of the local traders are now publicly saying they were misguided in their fears and actually it has been the making of their business or the saving of it ,\" he said. \"Go and ask the people of Tottenham about the investment which we have already made \u2026 We have to get better at telling the story and hopefully you have to get better at reporting it,\" he said. He also said it was \"ludicrous\" to claim that food prices were much higher than they used to be and that supermarket supply chains that involve trucking around the country were not efficient. \"Food is cheaper than it ever has been. Of course when you are sitting here today and the price has gone up compared to last week then that is real inflation and customers really feel the pinch in their weekly grocery shop. [But] the idea that food is expensive is ludicrous. \"Food and groceries more generally make up a smaller proportion of a household budget today than they have ever done in the history of this country and yet the food we are able to choose is more varied, more international, more healthy and safer than ever.\" As for distribution, King said critics forget that if we all only ate food grown within 10 miles of where we lived we would not be eating a very varied or indeed healthy and safe diet. He said: \"The way our supply chains work is they are incredibly efficient in their consumption of resource in terms of ultimately connecting the end consumer with the production. We want to run our vehicles over as short a distance as possible because fuel, vehicles and driver time are incredibly expensive. So there is no disconnect between the economic imperative to run them efficiently and the society imperative of something which is sustainable in carbon and energy terms.\" All the prejudices don't bear up to scrutiny. The reality is the supply chains we operate, particularly in the UK, are the most efficient on the planet.\" Asked whether Mary Portas's mission for the government to mend the high street was moving in the right direction, King said: \"The central thesis of Mary's which we have no problem with is that high streets will succeed if they are better, more vibrant places for people to go. Success breeds success. You are not going to save \u2013 if that is the right term \u2013 high streets by stopping, or trying to stop, other people from competing. \"The reasons for customers shopping in the shops they currently shop in is because many of the options they have are distinctly undesirable. So what will attract vibrant high streets is investment that make that attractive destinations. And of course it is a misrepresentation to suggest somehow supermarkets are not. We have around 600 supermarkets, around 200 are in what you or I would call a high street. Probably no one has done more to reinvigorate the high streets in the UK than supermarkets in the last five years and nobody more than us. Certainly every single one of our stores is reinvigorating the location it is in.\" Although Portas's report, published last December, attacked the rapacious growth of the supermarkets,she said at the time she saw little scope to bring about change in this area: \"I would stop it [supermarket expansion]. But to a certain extent the horse has bolted . We have let supermarkets do this and they have. The only way we can fight it is to create something different.\" Portas said this weekend she was writing to David Cameron to urgently pursue her recommendations on reviving the high street, fearing government support for her programme had dried up.",

Voters' perception of ministers as a bunch of out-of-touch toffs has been reinforced by Andrew Mitchell's ill-tempered brush with the law. Labour is a comfortable 10 points ahead in the opinion polls and Ed Miliband can look forward to a warm reception when he addresses the party conference on Tuesday. Could life get any better for the opposition? Of course it could. As Neil Kinnock would testify, winning general elections is different from holding mid-term opinion poll leads. Labour will only win if it convinces voters on the economy and, despite the progress made since Ed Balls became shadow chancellor, it still has a lot of work to do. Balls faced three big challenges when he took the job: ridding Labour of the reputation for having landed Britain in an awful mess; making the case that George Osborne's deficit-cutting strategy was a dud; and laying out a programme that would prove Labour could do a better job if it was returned to power. Let's start with the good news. Right from the start, Balls insisted back in 2010 that Osborne was a \"growth denier\", who would drive the economy back into recession with his heavy-handed and ill-timed stringency. The shadow chancellor made this point during the battle for the Labour leadership in the one speech of note during the entire campaign. He has been proved right. The economy has gone backwards and the deficit is getting bigger rather than smaller. Osborne derided Alistair Darling's deficit-reduction plan as a timid little affair but it now looks as if the UK's debt position will be worse in 2015 than it would have been had Gordon Brown remained in Downing Street. The chancellor has some plausible-sounding excuses for why this has happened. He says he inherited a structurally flawed economy (true); that it always takes longer to return to recovery after a severe banking crisis (also true); and that Europe's debt crisis has been the main factor impeding the return to robust growth (much less true). The blunt fact is, however, that in May 2010 he told voters that his plan would work and it hasn't. Game, set and match to Balls, then? Not quite. Osborne certainly looks like a Wimbledon player a couple of breaks of serve down in the final set, but he has not given up hope that the economy will turn the corner over the next year. Third-quarter growth will be worse than it looks on the surface, but falling inflation should ease the squeeze on consumer spending power and there are signs that the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme is leading to a slight rise in the flow of credit to households. There is nothing to suggest that the economy is about to surge forward, but it is possible that a slow recovery in 2013 will provide cash-rich businesses with the incentive to invest over 2014. Osborne would then have the basis for an economic argument at the 2015 election: we inherited a mess and it has been a slog, but we are finally getting there. Balls would counter by saying that Britain could have got there a whole lot quicker had it not been for coalition blunders. Even so, if the backdrop to the 2015 election is an economy growing at 2.5-3% a year, Balls' task becomes a lot more difficult. Firstly, he must deal with the legacy issues from Labour's period in office from 1997-2010. The main criticism of the Blair-Brown governments is that they left office with the budget deficit at a peacetime record of 11% of GDP. This, though, was caused by the collapse of the economy and the failure of UK banks in the worst recession since the interwar years. Had Brown and Darling sought to balance the budget when demand was imploding, the recession would have been far worse. Instead, the really telling criticisms of Labour are that it allowed the City of London to become the Wild West of global finance, that it neglected Britain's crumbling manufacturing base because it was too busy cuddling up to hedge fund dealers, and that it allowed the public finances to deteriorate in the years leading up to before the crash by wrongly believing that the tax receipts from the bubbles in the housing and stock markets were permanent rather than temporary. Memories fade, but has the electorate forgiven and forgotten all that happened under Labour? Probably not, which is why Balls feels he must promise a root-and-branch examination of public spending if Labour wins the election. This makes political sense, because a big plank of the Conservative strategy in 2015 will be to make Labour explain which taxes will rise to pay for spending pledges. That proved an effective campaign weapon in 1992, when it allowed the Conservatives to avoid defeat despite presiding over five years of boom and bust. The second challenge for Balls and Miliband is to show that Labour would make a decent fist of running the economy after 2015. This is not the same as having a five-point plan to kick-start growth; nor will it be achieved by promising to chuck money at every problem. In simplified form, the state of Britain is as follows: the economy is 4% smaller than it was five years ago and the latest quarterly current account deficit was in excess of \u00a320bn. Five million people are on housing waiting lists yet housebuilding is at its lowest since the 1920s. The Libor scandal has illustrated once again that the City is a cesspit. New sources of tax revenue need to be found to meet the demands of a modern welfare state. North Sea oil and gas reserves are running out fast and the Conservative part of the coalition is backtracking on the environment. Labour needs policies for all these areas. Neal Lawson, chairman of the thinktank Compass, noted last week: \"The party has nothing to say on public-sector reform, nothing on welfare reform and nothing on climate change. If they have, then I and everyone else has missed it. Why not a real Green New Deal, a financial transaction tax? Why aren't we pushing harder on a living wage, a German-style KfW environmental bank, real separation of the big retail and investment banks, new rules on takeovers, workers on boards, a national carers scheme, taxes on land and wealth, and so much more?\" Miliband went some of the way to meeting these concerns with his pledge to split up banks unless they change the way they operate and put customers first. But the party conference is the start of a crucial few months for Labour. Until now it has been able to think and act like an opposition. To win, it now has to start thinking and acting like a government in waiting.",
