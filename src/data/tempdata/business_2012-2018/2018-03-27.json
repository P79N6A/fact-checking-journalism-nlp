      "bodyText": "Melrose has promised to keep its headquarters and listing in the UK, after the government stepped in to seek binding assurances from the turnaround specialist over its hostile \u00a38bn bid for the engineering group GKN. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has written to Melrose \u2013 which has been headquartered in the UK since it was founded in 2003 \u2013 to demand a long-term approach, saying the bid had sparked concerns relating to national security given GKN\u2019s work for the Ministry of Defence. Clark told MPs during a parliamentary debate that stable ownership and financing were critical in the defence sector, and that the \u201cMelrose model has been built on short-term ownership\u201d. \u201cI have therefore sought a legally binding commitment from Melrose to greater continuity of ownership specific to the defence-related businesses and to exclude the option of a short-term sale of this business without the prior consent of the government,\u201d he said. \u201cI have also made clear that in the event of a successful bid the Ministry of Defence would look to require a legally binding commitment relating to the management of any defence contracts.\u201d Pressed by MPs, Clark said he would decide on whether to use his statutory powers to block the takeover \u2013 if it is approved by shareholders on Thursday \u2013 on national security grounds after taking advice from the MoD and agencies. The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, criticised the business secretary for waiting until the \u201clast minute\u201d to get assurances from Melrose. The London-based turnaround specialist made its initial hostile bid two and a half months ago. She added: \u201cIf the government thinks that today\u2019s weak, late and unenforceable assurances from Melrose are sufficient then they are deeply mistaken. There is nothing to assure workers nor put to bed concerns about our industrial strategy and national security.\u201d Clark\u2019s intervention came before a Thursday 1pm deadline when GKN investors have to decide whether to support the offer from Melrose or the GKN management plan to spin off its automotive business and merge it with the US company Dana, leaving GKN focused on aerospace. Clark has sought a series of legally binding commitments from Melrose, ensuring that it operates as a UK business, based and listed in the UK; maintains a UK workforce and respects the existing employment rights; continues to pay tax in the UK and to invest in research and development; pays suppliers on time; and safeguards pensioners\u2019 interests. Simon Peckham, the Melrose chief executive, wrote back to the business secretary, insisting: \u201cWe are British and work in the national interest.\u201d He gave a five-year \u201clegally enforceable\u201d commitment, agreed with the takeover panel, that Melrose would maintain its UK listing and UK headquarters, ensure a majority of its directors are resident in the UK, and maintain GKN\u2019s R&amp;D spending at 2.2% of sales. Melrose also gave a further commitment \u2013 outside the takeover regime \u2013 that it would not sell GKN\u2019s aerospace division before April 2023. But it reserved the right to float the business on the stock market, and said it would seek government approval if it was approached by a buyer within the five years. Several MPs from all the main parties said the five-year commitments were far too short. The Labour MP Adrian Bailey said the industry had investment cycles of 20 to 40 years. Hedge funds, mostly merger arbitrage funds, are estimated to control 20% to 25% of GKN\u2019s shares, either directly or though derivative contracts. Many of them are expected to accept the Melrose offer but will not pay stamp duty if they hold derivatives in GKN shares. The Labour MP Jack Dromey said: \u201cIf reports are true, it is utterly scandalous that these speculators could decide the future of a 259-year-old engineering icon purely to make a quick buck, and at the same time not even pay stamp duty on their transactions. The government must look into this issue as a matter of urgency.\u201d Rachel Maclean, the Tory MP for Redditch, said the 260 people working at GKN\u2019s headquarters had been told they would lose their jobs if the takeover goes through. GKN, one of Britain\u2019s biggest industrial groups, employs more than 59,000 people globally including 6,000 in the UK. It makes parts for the aviation industry, such as the Boeing 737 jet and Black Hawk helicopter, as well as components for Volkswagen and Ford cars. Steve Turner, the Unite union\u2019s assistant general secretary for aerospace, said: \u201cThe assurances that the government claims to have secured are unenforceable, short term and completely inadequate.\u201d GKN shares closed 0.3% lower at 430.3p on . Melrose shares rose 1.2% to 223.7p, valuing its cash and shares offer at 465.2p. If Melrose does not get the required 50% plus one share acceptances by the Thursday deadline it will walk away. The company must make an announcement before 5pm under the takeover code. Shareholders are divided, with those publicly backing Melrose accounting for nearly 10% of the shareholder base, compared with 9% for those supporting the GKN board.. Unite and the Trade Union Share Owners group (Tuso) wrote to GKN investors this week to warn that a Melrose takeover could \u201cseverely damage GKN\u2019s customer base\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Philip Green escapes company director ban for BHS \u00a31 deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has escaped a ban from serving as a company director by the Insolvency Service over the deal to sell BHS for \u00a31 in 2015, a year before the retailer collapsed. However, Dominic Chappell, who led the consortium that bought BHS, faces a lengthy boardroom ban after a government inquiry into the collapse of the retailer in 2016, which led to the loss of 11,000 jobs. Frank Field, the Labour chair of the Commons work and pensions select committee investigating BHS, issued a sharp attack on the Insolvency Service for handing out a reprieve to Green while continuing to pursue Chappell. \u201cThis is the same tired old story of the establishment powers being strong on the weak, and weak on the strong,\u201d he said. Field likened the move to Shakespeare using the name Banquo for the title of his play Macbeth, after the lesser character in the classic tale of greed, ambition and lust for power. \u201cI would have thought that practically the whole country is aghast,\u201d he said, adding that the Insolvency Service should publish its report into the decision \u201cso the nation can understand how this extraordinary result came about\u201d. Chappell and three other former BHS directors have been told by the government agency that they could face bans of up to 15 years, the maximum theit can impose. The Insolvency Service refused to name the other directors it is seeking to disqualify. Confirming the decision, the Insolvency Service saidit had \u201cwritten to Dominic Chappell and three other former directors of BHS and connected companies informing them that we intend to bring proceedings to have them disqualified from running or controlling companies for periods up to 15 years. \u201cWe can also confirm that we have written to Sir Philip Green, also a former director of BHS, informing him that we do not currently intend to bring disqualification proceedings against him. \u201cAs this matter may now be tested in the court it is not appropriate to comment further.\u201d The collapse of BHS prompted an inquiry by MPs and the pensions regulator into how the business had been managed and financed in the period before its collapse. The retailer had a pension deficit of up to \u00a3571m when it failed. Under substantial pressure, Green \u2013 who owned BHS for 15 years before selling it to Chappell \u2013 subsequently agreed to hand over \u00a3363m to the scheme in a deal with the regulator. A spokesman for Green said on Tuesday: \u201cOn 15 March, the Insolvency Service informed Sir Philip Green that it had concluded its investigation into BHS and confirmed that he will not be the subject of any proceedings under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. \u201cIdentical confirmations have also been sent to a number of other individuals who were BHS directors in the period prior to its acquisition by Retail Acquisitions Ltd. \u201cSir Philip and his fellow directors have cooperated fully with the Insolvency Service since its investigation commenced in May 2016 and welcome this decision.\u201d Under usual processes, Chappell and the three other former BHS directors will have the opportunity to argue the case that such action against them is unjustified, before the Insolvency Service begins formal court proceedings. Thrice-bankrupt Chappell, 51, was also ordered last month to pay a \u00a350,000 fine and \u00a337,000 court costs for failing to disclose vital detail to the pensions watchdog as part of an inquiry into BHS. However, he has argued he has no funds. The Pensions Regulator, which is responsible for safeguarding British retirement schemes, moved to protect the pensions of 19,000 members. Just days after BHS collapsed, Chappell was ordered to hand over hundreds of documents in relation to the pension black hole. When he failed to comply, the regulator charged Chappell with neglecting or refusing to respond to three section 72 notices to provide information and documents. He has also been issued with a formal demand for about \u00a310m relating to the pension scheme. Green, who also owns the Topshop chain, agreed to pay up to \u00a3363m into the pension scheme to end the threat of legal action against him by the regulator. The Insolvency Service investigation into BHS\u2019s collapse was the last inquiry in which he was involved.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline is putting Horlicks up for sale to help fund a buyout of the remaining $13bn stake in its consumer healthcare joint venture with Novartis. GSK said it was launching a \u201cstrategic review\u201d of the 145-year-old malted drink and its other consumer healthcare nutrition products, as it announced plans to buy Novartis\u2019s 36.5% in the joint venture, formed in 2015. The deal with Novartis will give GSK full control of a portfolio of products that includes Sensodyne toothpaste, Panadol headache tablets, muscle gel Voltaren, and Nicotinell patches. The company said: \u201cGSK is initiating a strategic review of Horlicks and its other consumer healthcare nutrition products to support funding of the transaction, and to drive increased focus on over-the-counter and oral health categories. Combined sales of these products were approximately \u00a3550m in 2017.\u201d Horlicks was invented in 1873 by the British-born brothers William and James Horlick, who had emigrated to the US. They opened a factory in Slough in 1908, and Horlicks became popular as a lightweight, non-perishable, and high-calorie food supplement. During the second world war, Horlicks tablets were popular among soldiers and were carried by aircrew in their escape kits. Announcing the review, GSK said the majority of Horlicks sales were generated in India, where the drinks range was seen as a portfolio of premium nutrition products. Last year the company announced plans to close the Slough factory and sell the Horlicks brand in the UK \u2013 which generates sales of about \u00a315m to \u00a320m. A deal has been agreed with Aimia Foods and is progressing, a spokesman said. In India the products are sold by GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd, a public company listed on the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange. The review will include an assessment of GSK\u2019s 72.5% shareholding in the company, it said. \u201cGSK expects the outcome of the strategic review to be concluded around the end of 2018. There can be no assurance that the review process will result in any transaction,\u201d the company added. The FTSE 100 company said India would continue to be one of its priority markets, where it would target growth in its over-the-counter and oral health brands, such as Sensodyne and Eno. Commenting on the deal, the GSK chief executive, Emma Walmsley, said: \u201cThe proposed transaction addresses one of our key capital allocation priorities and will allow GSK shareholders to capture the full value of one of the world\u2019s leading consumer healthcare businesses.\u201d She added that it would benefit adjusted earnings and cash flows, as well as removing uncertainty, allowing the company to better plan investment in priority areas, especially pharmaceuticals research and development. Last week, GSK pulled out of the bidding to buy Pfizer\u2019s $20bn (\u00a314bn) consumer healthcare business. Ketan Patel, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, said: \u201cThe decision not to pay up for Pfizer\u2019s consumer assets will have led Emma Walmsley to remove uncertainty by bringing all the consumer revenues in-house and assisting toward efficient capital allocation. \u201cThe chief executives at both GSK and Novartis are young and early into their tenures and keen to make a mark by making decisive changes to the business models. Long-term investors will welcome the greater clarity this brings to both companies.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "EasyJet announces Berlin expansion and new long-haul link-ups", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "EasyJet Europe, the sister airline set up to preserve easyJet after Brexit, has accelerated its growth by announcing rapid expansion in Berlin and new long-haul connections at Paris and Amsterdam. The easyJet chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the growth potential is in Europe. The UK will always be a critical market, but we have more to go at in the European mainland.\u201d EasyJet expects to fly 5.6 million passengers this year from Berlin, making it comfortably the biggest airline in the German capital, ahead of Lufthansa. Lundgren added: \u201cThe German population have paid too much money to go on flights and that\u2019s something we want to change.\u201d The airline has been at Berlin\u2019s Sch\u00f6nefeld airport since 2004 but started operations at the city\u2019s Tegel facilities after taking over parts of Air Berlin in January. However, the new base may not last long, after Berlin\u2019s senate signalled this week it would ignore a referendum and close Tegel when the long-delayed Brandenburg airport finally opens, provisionally in 2020. EasyJet is in talks with Middle East and Asian carriers to allow more customers to book connecting flights, which are mainly currently served by Norwegian at Gatwick, as well as Thomas Cook. The service will be offered later this year at Berlin, Venice, Amsterdam Schiphol, Paris Charles De Gaulle and Orly, and Edinburgh, meaning more than half of the airline\u2019s flight network could potentially connect to other services. Lundgren pledged to eliminate flight delays by using data to predict aircraft failures, but admitted that most disruption will remain out of the airline\u2019s hands. EasyJet has announced a five-year deal with Airbus to forecast aircraft technical faults before they occur. Delays or cancellations due to plane problems have been reduced from 10 to three flights in every 1,000 on easyJet\u2019s newest aircraft, according to the airline. A three-year trial on a limited number of aircraft pre-empted at least 31 technical failures, Airbus said. The technology will now be applied to easyJet\u2019s entire A320 fleet. Lundgren said the airline would also make further use of its own data to model flight schedules and analyse how to mitigate delays. However, he said easyJet and other airlines had remained frustrated in their attempts to push the EU to rein in air traffic control strikes \u2013 which he described as aviation\u2019s biggest problem. A strike in France last week, which saw significant numbers of international flights cancelled or delayed, is likely to be followed by many more this summer. \u201cThe ATC strikes, that\u2019s the biggest issue we are facing,\u201d Lundgren said. \u201cWe can lobby for changes \u2013 but also use the data to predict and minimise the effects of disruption.\u201d EasyJet said it had also analysed data for frequency of disruptive passenger incidents and altered schedules for destinations such as Ibiza and Alicante.",

      "bodyText": "Signs that the US and China could be talking behind the scenes about avoiding a trade war have given global markets a lift after last week\u2019s slump. European markets, which had missed out on Monday\u2019s gains, have moved sharply higher today, with the FTSE 100 currently up around 2%, Germany\u2019s Dax 1.7% better and France\u2019s Cac climbing 1.3%. At the US open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has also risen after Monday\u2019s 700 point gain. There were signs of weakness in the European economy, as business sentiment fell by more than expected in March. Elsewhere our monthly Brexit watch showed the UK economy showing signs of steadying a year ahead of the country\u2019s departure from the European Union. On the corporate front, the insolvency service wants to disqualify former BHS owner Dominic Chappell from being a director for up to 15 years. In the bid battle for GKN, which comes to a head on Thursday, predator Melrose has promised to keep the company\u2019s aerospace division for at least five years. And more bad news for retailers, with profit falls at H&amp;M, Moss Bros and Game Digital. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The rally on US markets on Monday which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average add nearly 700 points has continued at the opening of trading. The easing of fears over a possible trade war between the US and China has lifted the Dow another 50 points or 0.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.48%. Sterling is falling back after its recent strong run after last week\u2019s agreement between the UK and EU on a Brexit transition deal. A spate of profit taking has seen the pound fall 0.8% against the dollar to $1.4114 and 0.3% against the euro to \u20ac1.1399. The UK economy is steadying after the initial fallout from the vote to leave the European Union, according to our monthly Brexit watch series. Richard Partington reports: As the one-year countdown to Brexit looms, the British economy is showing signs of steadying from the fallout triggered by the EU referendum, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. After progress with Brussels towards a two-year transitional deal to smooth Britain\u2019s formal exit from the EU on 29 March 2019, the pound has risen back towards the highest levels seen since the leave vote. Inflation triggered by the drop in sterling after the referendum is finally beginning to fade, just as pay rises begin to come through for workers. But while the Guardian\u2019s latest Brexit dashboard hands support to Philip Hammond\u2019s reasons for feeling \u201cTiggerish\u201d at the spring statement earlier this month, sharp challenges remain. The full story is here: And here are the monthly statistics: And the experts\u2019 verdict: Following the collapse of BHS, the insolvency service has said it will bring proceedings to disqualify Dominic Chappell, who bought the department store group from Sir Philip Green from running a company for up to 15 years. Its full verdict: We can confirm the Insolvency Service has written to Dominic Chappell and three other former directors of BHS and connected companies informing them that we intend to bring proceedings to have them disqualified from running or controlling companies for periods up to 15 years. We can also confirm that we have written to Sir Philip Green, also a former director of BHS, informing him that we do not currently intend bring disqualification proceedings against him. As this matter may now be tested in the Court it is not appropriate to comment further. Royal Bank of Scotland has made its first acquisition since its ill-fated purchase of ABN Amro which went sour during the financial crisis. PA has the details: RBS has snapped up accounting software firm FreeAgent, marking the lender\u2019s first acquisition since its controversial crisis-era deal to buy ABN Amro. The taxpayer-owned bank said it had agreed to buy the company for around 120p per share, valuing it at 53 million. The decision comes weeks after the company reported its first profit in a decade and as the Government prepares to start selling off its 72% holding. Chief executive Ross McEwan said: \u201cWe have been impressed by FreeAgent and its technology and are excited by the enhanced offering we will be able to provide to our customers. \u201cWe believe that a technology-enabled solution for our business banking customers will make it easier for our customers to build their businesses safely and securely.\u201d It marks RBS\u2019s first foray into deal-making since its 49 billion acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007, which quickly turned toxic. In 2008, RBS was forced to announce an emergency rights issue, asking existing shareholders to inject 12 billion into the firm to strengthen its reserves. Months later, the value of RBS shares plunged 90%, prompting a 45.5 billion Government bailout. FreeAgent specialises in cloud-based accounting software and mobile applications aimed at businesses with 10 or fewer employees. Given Donald Trump\u2019s keenness on a strong stock market he may not want to really follow through on his trade war threats, suggest Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda There are a lot of risks that financial markets have shrugged off over the last couple of years, to the amazement at times of investors, but the prospect of a trade war is clearly not one of these. [This] has weighed heavily on risk appetite over the last couple of weeks with US equity markets posting significant losses on Thursday and Friday as things heated up. The message over the weekend though was far less confrontational and suggested the US would be open to scrapping the tariffs in exchange for certain other concessions such as reduced tariffs on important cars. Ultimately, Trump\u2019s target was and remains to reduce the county\u2019s sizeable trade deficit with a number of countries and while he may give the impression that a trade war is a worthwhile sacrifice, I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s as keen on it as he makes out. The question now is how big a concession other countries are willing to make to appease him, if any, and whether it will be sufficient enough for him to sell it to US voters as a worthwhile victory. Given the reaction we\u2019ve seen in markets over the last couple of week\u2019s I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be keen to follow through on his threats and risk sending markets into a tailspin. European markets continue to gain ground. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to open around 170 points higher, the FTSE 100 is now up 140 points or 2%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 2.01% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.5%. As far as the FTSE 100 goes, the rise comes after four straight declines and marks the biggest one day rise for nearly a year (since 24 April 2017). The outlook for the eurozone economy could well become less benign over the summer as uncertainty impacts sentiment, says Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING Bank. And there is little in the latest confidence survey which will please the European Central Bank, he says: This drop in the eurozone sentiment indicator from 114.2 to 112.6 rounds out the second month of disappointing survey data for the Eurozone. While the economy continues to perform strongly, some clouds have reemerged on the horizon. Trade war concerns take centre stage and are adding uncertainty to the outlook for businesses and impacting the view on the general economic situation for consumers. Both manufacturers and the service sector experienced declining sentiment. Consumer confidence was unchanged after a large drop in February as lower expectations for inflation offset a weaker view on the economy and household finances. Last month, the drop was mainly due to a decline in expectations from manufacturers and consumers. The developments in recent production, new orders and exports were only slightly negative. This month, we see indicators for recent production and new orders have come down somewhat more. Even though still at elevated levels of activity, this does signal that some moderation of growth seems to be under way. On the bright side, employment expectations in services continue to improve despite uncertainty about global growth, meaning that the job market is likely to stand firm in the months ahead which should limit the downside to consumption growth as well. Export orders books only dropped from 2.5 to 2, indicating that the main channel through which trade concerns impact the economy for the moment is confidence and not yet trade itself. The inflation outlook came down in March as both consumers and businesses in manufacturing and services saw selling price expectations decrease. As pipeline price pressures seem to level off a bit and the economic outlook is coming down from cloud nine, there is not much in this survey that will please the ECB. Expect continued dovish talk as the summer and decision on QE approaches. European businesses have become more downbeat, according to the latest snapshot of economic sentiment. The European Commission\u2019s index for the eurozone fell to 112.6 in March from 114.2 in the previous month, below estimates of a level of 113.4. There was decline optimism among the manufacturing, service and retail sectors, but the construction sector showed a small improvement. But consumer sentiment was unchanged from February to March. In the EU as a whole, the index fell by 1.9 points to 112.5, partly due to a sharp drop in the UK. The Commission said: The marginally stronger decrease of the headline indicator for the EU (-1.9) was mainly due to the marked deterioration of sentiment in the largest non-euro area EU economies, the UK (-4.2), and Poland (-2.0). In line with the euro area, confidence deteriorated strongly in industry, services, and retail trade, while it increased slightly in the construction sector and remained unchanged among consumers. Back with GKN and the hostile bid from Melrose, union Unite has repeated its opposition to the proposed takeover. In a letter to GKN shareholders it lists a number of reasons why: A Melrose takeover has the potential to severely damage GKN\u2019s customer base The timescales required in the aerospace and automotive industries is not compatible with Melrose\u2019s approach Melrose does not have the skills or experience needed to make this bid a success Melrose\u2019s plans for splitting the company will weaken its future prospects Increase in debt will increase risk Role of short-term investors in the takeover process - their support for the bid is motivated by a desire to make a short-term profit through arbitrage GKN stakeholders united in opposition to Melrose\u2019s bid - Concern has been expressed by the company\u2019s customers, its trade unions, its pension fund trustees, politicians and a growing number of long-term shareholders. The union concludes: We do not believe this bid is in the long-term interest of GKN and are concerned that it would jeopardise the company\u2019s future. The choice facing investors is between a long-term future for GKN or a short-term, high-risk approach from Melrose. We therefore ask you not to accept Melrose\u2019s offer. So far it seems there may not be any profit taking when Wall Street opens later, despite Monday\u2019s near 700 point surge on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The futures are pointing to a 100 point plus rise on the Dow in early trading, which should continue to give some support to European markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: US markets look set to build on yesterday\u2019s gains despite their biggest one day gain in over 2 years, as trade concerns move further into the background. Shares in focus are likely to include Facebook which, despite dropping below $150 for the first time since July last year, still managed to close higher on the day. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s deadline for GKN investors to decide whether to accept the hostile \u00a37.9bn bid from turnaround specialist Melrose or back the board, comes the daily update on the battle. This time Melrose has made some commitments to try and keep interested parties - not least the UK government - happy. Reuters has the details: Melrose on Tuesday pledged to own the Aerospace division of its bid target GKN for at least five years and to increase funding in apprenticeships and R&amp;D in a last-ditch bid to win government backing for its hostile takeover. In one of Britain\u2019s most hotly contested corporate battles for years, shareholders have until 1pm BST on Thursday to accept the hostile bid from turnaround specialist Melrose or GKN\u2019s plan to split off its auto unit and combine it with US group Dana, leaving GKN focused on Aerospace. Some politicians have objected to Melrose buying GKN because they fear it could break up the mainstay of Britain\u2019s engineering sector and sell it on to foreign buyers. On Tuesday Melrose said it would keep the Aerospace unit until April 2023. Melrose said it reserved the right to list the Aerospace division on the stock market however and added that were it to be approached by a strategic buyer in that time, it would seek the approval of the government to sell. The group said it would also pump a further \u00a310m into the company over five years to support the creation of between 100 and 150 new apprenticeships in engineering, technology and science, a key area of focus for the government which is promoting an industrial strategy as it leaves the EU. It has also committed to spend at least 2.2 percent of sales on research and development, saying this figure should be seen as a \u201cfloor, not a ceiling on our ambitions\u201d. More downbeat news from the high street. Fashion retailer H&amp;M has reported a 61% fall in first quarter profits and said higher inventories would lead to increased markdowns in the second three months of the year. The Swedish company had already warned in February that weak demand would hit its earnings. Elsewhere Game Digital said half year revenues rose from \u00a3498m to \u00a3517m but profits fell 25.5% from \u00a316.5m to \u00a312.3m. It said it would continue to negotiate property savings, close stores and rationalise retail working hours, but looked forward to a large number of new software releases, especially in the final quarter of this year. And Moss Bros confirmed last week\u2019s warning by unveiling a 6.1% fall in annual profits to \u00a36.7m, hit by stock shortages and a tough retail environment. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said: Last week\u2019s profit warning may have taken some of the sting out of the situation, but Moss Bros is already facing an uphill struggle for the remainder of its trading year. After the rise on Wall Street and Asia as trade tensions between the US and China ease, European markets have followed suit. The FTSE 100 is up 90 points or 1.3%, Germany\u2019s Dax has opened up 1.8%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.35% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 1.48% better. The only faller in the UK\u2019s leading index is drinks giant Diageo, down marginally after it announced that the appointment of Ursula Burns to its board - due on 2 April - would be delayed following news she would be made interim executive chair of Nasdaq listed Veon. Another factor for the renewed buoyancy in stock markets comes from North Korea, says Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets : Investors have reacted positively to the surprise visit of North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un to China. This is his first trip outside his country since he became the leader of his country. Traders are considering this event as a further evidence of de-escalation of tensions in the Asia region. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A surge on Wall Street has lifted Asian markets and is expected to do the same for European shares, as investors become increasingly convinced the US and China can resolve their trade issues. After last week\u2019s rout in the wake of President Trump announcing $60bn of tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, on top of his steel and aluminium sanctions, signs that the two sides were talking has led to a market revival. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The rebound in the US [came] as China moved to assuage US concerns about its trade policies by pledging to open up its markets to external companies. Chinese officials also pledged to overhaul protection for intellectual property rights. There was also an offer to buy more US semiconductors, as well as offering to finalise rules that would allow foreign financial firms to take stakes in Chinese securities companies, along with talk of lowering the tariff that is levied on US car imports of 25% These concessions while fairly modest would allow the US administration to claim progress on changing the status quo where trade is concerned and could pave the way for further discussions further down the line. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.81% or 669 points - the third highest points gain ever and its best percentage gain for nearly two and a half years. Although to put that in context, the percentage rise was less than the 2.93% slump recorded on Thursday after Trump unveiled the Chinese move. Nevertheless, the revival on Wall Street has pushed Asian shares higher, with the Nikkei 225 up 2.3% and the Hang Seng around 0.9% better. European shares missed out on the gains yesterday, partly on concerns about a slowdown in the region\u2019s economy, said Hewson, with the US tax reforms which helped support Wall Street before the tariff shenanigans unlikely to give much of a lift to European companies. But they are expected to benefit in early trading, with the FTSE 100 expected to open around 80 points higher, Germany\u2019s Dax up 170 points and France\u2019s Cac around 60 points. Elsewhere it is another fairly quiet day on the economic front, apart from eurozone and consumer confidence figures and a US manufacturing survey. On the corporate front, GlaxoSmithKline is planning a review of its Horlicks business as part of a deal to buy out Novartis\u2019 36.5% stake in their Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture for $13bn. And one of the founders of Superdry, Julian Dunkerton is leaving the retailer on Saturday to \u201cdevote more time to his other business and charitable interests.\u201d",

And there is little in the latest confidence survey which will please the European Central Bank, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This drop in the eurozone sentiment indicator from 114.2 to 112.6 rounds out the second month of disappointing survey data for the Eurozone.</p> <p>While the economy continues to perform strongly, some clouds have reemerged on the horizon. Trade war concerns take centre stage and are adding uncertainty to the outlook for businesses and impacting the view on the general economic situation for consumers. Both manufacturers and the service sector experienced declining sentiment. Consumer confidence was unchanged after a large drop in February as lower expectations for inflation offset a weaker view on the economy and household finances.</p> <p>Last month, the drop was mainly due to a decline in expectations from manufacturers and consumers. The developments in recent production, new orders and exports were only slightly negative. This month, we see indicators for recent production and new orders have come down somewhat more. Even though still at elevated levels of activity, this does signal that some moderation of growth seems to be under way.</p> <p>On the bright side, employment expectations in services continue to improve despite uncertainty about global growth, meaning that the job market is likely to stand firm in the months ahead which should limit the downside to consumption growth as well. Export orders books only dropped from 2.5 to 2, indicating that the main channel through which trade concerns impact the economy for the moment is confidence and not yet trade itself.</p> <p>The inflation outlook came down in March as both consumers and businesses in manufacturing and services saw selling price expectations decrease. As pipeline price pressures seem to level off a bit and the economic outlook is coming down from cloud nine, there is not much in this survey that will please the ECB. Expect continued dovish talk as the summer and decision on QE approaches.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5aba0910e4b0a30fbbaa0e44\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-27T09:12:10.898Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone business confidence falls</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European businesses have become more downbeat, according to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/indicators-statistics/economic-databases/business-and-consumer-surveys/download-business-and-consumer-survey-data/press-releases_en\">the latest snapshot of economic sentiment.</a></p> <p>The European Commission\u2019s index for the eurozone fell to 112.6 in March from 114.2 in the previous month, below estimates of a level of 113.4.

The Commission said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The marginally stronger decrease of the headline indicator for the EU (-1.9) was mainly due to the marked deterioration of sentiment in the largest non-euro area EU economies, the UK (-4.2), and Poland (-2.0).

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rebound in the US [came] as China moved to assuage US concerns about its trade policies by pledging to open up its markets to external companies. Chinese officials also pledged to overhaul protection for intellectual property rights. There was also an offer to buy more US semiconductors, as well as offering to finalise rules that would allow foreign financial firms to take stakes in Chinese securities companies, along with talk of lowering the tariff that is levied on US car imports of 25%</p> <p>These concessions while fairly modest would allow the US administration to claim progress on changing the status quo where trade is concerned and could pave the way for further discussions further down the line.</p> </blockquote> <p>So the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.81% or 669 points - the third highest points gain ever and its best percentage gain for nearly two and a half years. Although to put that in context, the percentage rise was less than the 2.93% slump recorded on Thursday after Trump unveiled the Chinese move.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the revival on Wall Street has pushed Asian shares higher, with the Nikkei 225 up 2.3% and the Hang Seng around 0.9% better.</p> <p>European shares missed out on the gains yesterday, partly on concerns about a slowdown in the region\u2019s economy, said Hewson, with the US tax reforms which helped support Wall Street before the tariff shenanigans unlikely to give much of a lift to European companies.</p> <p>But they are expected to benefit in early trading, with the FTSE 100 expected to open around 80 points higher, Germany\u2019s Dax up 170 points and France\u2019s Cac around 60 points.</p> <p>Elsewhere it is another fairly quiet day on the economic front, apart from eurozone and consumer confidence figures and a US manufacturing survey.</p> <p>On the corporate front, GlaxoSmithKline is planning a review of its Horlicks business as part of a deal to buy out Novartis\u2019 36.5% stake in their Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture for $13bn.</p> <p>And <a href=\"https://www.investegate.co.uk/superdry-plc--sdry-/rns/directorate-change/201803270700079946I/\">one of the founders of Superdry, Julian Dunkerton is leaving the retailer on Saturday</a> to \u201cdevote more time to his other business and charitable interests.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-03-27T06:48:55.983Z\">at 7.48am BST</time></p>  </div>",

The company, which runs the UK\u2019s national electricity network and wants to build superfast car charging points at motorway services, told MPs it could cope with the demands of an earlier surge in electric car numbers. Graeme Cooper, the firm\u2019s director of electric vehicles, told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee: \u201cFrom Grid\u2019s point of view, 2030 or 2040 is far enough out [to act].\u201d Asked if the company could handle the challenge of managing energy supplies if sales of fossil fuel-powered cars were banned in 2030, he said: \u201cAbsolutely, no problem at all.\u201d Questioned by Labour MP Vernon Coaker on whether National Grid would back a 2030 deadline, Cooper said the firm would support a more ambitious target. The Energy Networks Association, which represents local power grids, did not go as far as National Grid\u2019s backing for an earlier date but said: \u201cIf the target was brought forward, energy networks are ready to deliver.\u201d An environmental thinktank recently said a more aggressive target of 2030 would help almost halve the UK\u2019s oil imports and virtually close the looming gap in the country\u2019s carbon targets. Cooper also told the MPs that even with 9m electric cars on the road by 2030 \u2013 a huge rise from about 130,000 at present \u2013 there would be would be little need for new power stations, provided the vehicles were charged at off-peak times. \u201c[We] could see much greater demand for energy [by 2030],\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the charging is done smartly so you\u2019re not adding to the peak of the day; then new generation, there\u2019s not really a tremendous amount really needed.\u201d He said that scenarios published last year by National Grid \u2013 which suggested the UK could need the equivalent of six Hinkley Point C nuclear power stations by 2050 to cope with electric cars \u2013 were the worst possible situation. He said that outcome was unlikely as drivers would not all charge at the same time. \u201cThe probability is close on zero,\u201d he told Rachel Reeves, the committee\u2019s chair. Cooper also hinted that its report this summer would revise up its estimate of 9m electric cars by 2030, given how fast they were developing. The firm is eyeing 50 sites across the UK to build superfast charging points at motorway service stations to end fears of \u201crange anxiety\u201d. Cooper conceded the rural location of most services meant energy network upgrades for such chargers could be costly, telling MPs they would need \u201ctargeted investment\u201d. Ofgem said the cost of reinforcing electricity grids to cope with charging millions of cars should be largely paid for by electric vehicle owners, rather than all consumers via energy bills. Andrew Burgess, a partner at the energy regulator, said: \u201cThose who impose an extra cost should bear a fair proportion of that and we should protect consumers in general. And not have consumers who don\u2019t have electric vehicles subsidising those who do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As the one-year countdown to Brexit looms, the British economy is showing signs of steadying from the fallout triggered by the EU referendum, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. After progress with Brussels towards a two-year transitional deal to smooth Britain\u2019s formal exit from the EU on 29 March 2019, the pound has risen back towards the highest levels seen since the leave vote. Inflation triggered by the drop in sterling after the referendum is finally beginning to fade, just as pay rises begin to come through for workers. But while the Guardian\u2019s latest Brexit dashboard hands support to Philip Hammond\u2019s reasons for feeling \u201cTiggerish\u201d at the spring statement earlier this month, sharp challenges remain. With a year to go, there is little progress towards a final deal with Brussels. The uncertainty is putting business investment on hold, while a prospective global trade war triggered by Donald Trump could wreak havoc at a time when a still-fragile British economy needs to strike new relationships elsewhere around the world. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College and a former MPC member, said: \u201cThe report card this month shows progress but we could do better. This is a start.\u201d Having confounded the predictions for a recession made ahead of the referendum vote almost two years ago, the economy has still, however, lost significant momentum \u2013 growing at the slowest rate in the G7. There are also fears the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d cold snap in the past month could have had a damaging effect on the economy. Gridlocked motorways, empty restaurants and idle diggers seen across the country are expected to have cost the economy at least \u00a31bn a day and could halve GDP growth in the first three months of the year. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was better than expected. The latest dashboard shows light at the end of the tunnel for British households, which saw inflation rise well above pay growth last year. The rate of annual growth in prices dropped last month to 2.7% down from a peak of 3.1% last autumn, reaching its lowest level since July 2017. Meanwhile, average earnings grew at their fastest rate in more than two years. On the high street, retail sales increased for the first time in three months, helped by the drop in inflation. The country\u2019s dominant services sector also staged a recovery last month, although there was a slowdown in manufacturing activity, according to private surveys of business activity watched by the Bank of England for early signs of GDP growth. Threadneedle Street also signalled interest rates could rise from as early as May. Despite the recent fall in inflation, the Bank still expects the growth in prices to remain above its 2% target set by the government. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said UK inflation remains more than double the 1.2% rate in the euro area, and above the US rate of 2.2%, where the Federal Reserve is already raising interest rates. \u201cIt would not be surprising if the Bank started to follow the Fed\u2019s lead by edging UK rates up again in May,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Sterling stages recovery after Brexit talks progress The pound has strengthened over the course of the past month and is close to the highest levels seen since the EU referendum, after the government struck a provisional deal with Brussels over a transition period to smooth the Brexit process. Sterling had fallen against the dollar earlier in the month amid a recovery in the value of the US currency, but has since recovered thanks to the progress made in the EU talks, ending the month up about 1.6%. The pound is still worth about 5% less than it was immediately before the referendum. FTSE 100 continues to slide The financial markets have had a choppy start to the year amid fears the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates faster than previously anticipated to counter rising inflation and the prospect of a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump. In the past month, the FTSE 100 continued its slide to the lowest level seen since late 2016, falling by about 2.5%, although the decline was not as steep as the drop in the previous month. Theresa May was, however, handed bad news when blue-chip consumer group Unilever chose the Netherlands for its headquarters over London \u2013 a move viewed as a blow for Brexit Britain despite denials from the company that it had little to do with its decision. Better than forecast Inflation drops as Brexit vote effects begin to fade Inflation fell further than expected last month, as the effects of the Brexit vote on the price of petrol and food finally begin to fade, easing the pressure on squeezed British households. The consumer price index (CPI) fell to 2.7% last month from 3% in January, reaching its lowest level since July last year, according to the ONS. Economists\u2019 had expected 2.8%. Worse than forecast Trade deficit widens, while world reels from Trump steel tariffs The prospect of Britain successfully forging new trading relationships outside the EU took a knock when Donald Trump raised the chances of a global trade war by announcing punitive steel import tariffs. The UK trade deficit \u2013 the difference between what Britain buys from abroad and sells overseas \u2013 was also worse than expected in January, according to the latest ONS data. The trade in goods deficit rose to \u00a312.3bn, from a revised figure of \u00a311.8bn in December, driven wider by an increase in imports such as aircraft and cars from non-EU countries, as well as fuel from EU nations. Better than forecast Key industries point to stronger economic growth After a sluggish start to the year, there were signs of a fightback from key sectors of the British economy last month. Britain\u2019s dominant services sector recorded the fastest rise in new work since May 2017. The Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI, a key gauge of business activity, reached 54.5 in February from 53 in January \u2013 on a scale where anything above the 50 mark indicates growth. Although there was a slight fall in the rate of activity seen in the manufacturing sector, the construction industry staged a recovery alongside the services sector to indicate a gradual return of momentum for the economy as a whole. Worse than forecast Public finances unexpectedly worsen, despite positive trend An improving picture for the public finances was one of the only reasons for Philip Hammond to feel \u201cTiggerish\u201d at the spring statement, amid rapid growth in the value of self-assessed tax returns this financial year. However, the latest figures for February show the government borrowed \u00a31.3bn more than it received from taxes, which was worse than expected, for a deficit of about \u00a31.1bn. Nevertheless, borrowing for the financial year so far is \u00a32.5bn lower than at the same point in the previous period, at \u00a341.4bn, which is the best year for the public finances since 2008. Better than forecast UK earnings grow at the fastest rate in more than two years There were early signs that pay growth could finally begin to outstrip inflation last month, as the latest data from the ONS showed average weekly earnings rose at the fastest rate in more than two years in the three months ending in January. Total pay including bonuses rose by 2.8%, beating economists\u2019 expectations. Excluding those one-off rewards, wages rose by 2.6%, up from 2.5%. The number of people in work also increased by 168,000 to 32.25 million, pushing up the employment rate to 75.3%,the joint highest level since comparable records began in 1971. Better than forecast Retail sales rise, easing pressure on the high street After a torrid Christmas and a weak rebound in January, the British high street had a better February with the first increase in retail sales for three months. Growth was driven by sales of petrol, as well as online and in supermarkets. But there has been gloomy news for retailers in recent weeks, with the collapse of Maplin and Toys R Us, and Next reporting its most difficult year for a quarter of a century. Worse than expected House prices The downturn in the housing market gathered pace last month, as new buyer inquiries fell for the 11th month in a row and the average number of properties on estate agents\u2019 books dropped to a record low. The latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) showed the balance of surveyors reporting an increase in house prices over the last three months fell to zero, worse than forecast, and down from +8 in January. Despite the worrying national picture, there are some pockets of strength; with data from estate agency group YourMove suggesting the north-west of England had seen the fastest growth in house prices in the UK. Meanwhile, in parts of London prices have fallen by almost 15%. Asking prices are down in more than half of London postcodes. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month ... the UK won\u2019t save any money from Brexit for the next five years The bold claim that Britain sent \u00a3350m per week to the EU, which was painted on the side of the leave campaign\u2019s red bus ahead of the referendum, suggested a Brexit vote would mean more money for the NHS. But the latest estimate from the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggests there will be no savings from Brexit for the next five years. Meanwhile, the OBR also said it reckoned the final cost of Britain\u2019s Brexit \u201cdivorce bill\u201d with Brussels would be about \u00a337.1bn, and that it would be paid until at least 2064.",

But there has been gloomy news for retailers in recent weeks, with the collapse of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/maplin-63-head-office-workers-made-redundant-administration\">Maplin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/14/toys-r-us-to-shut-all-uk-stores-resulting-in-3000-job-losses\">Toys R Us</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/23/next-profits-fall-retailer-brexit\">Next</a> reporting its most difficult year for a quarter of a century. </p> \n<h2>Worse than expected</h2> \n<h2>House prices</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"rics\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The downturn in the housing market gathered pace last month, as new buyer inquiries fell for the 11th month in a row and the average number of properties on estate agents\u2019 books dropped to a record low. The latest <a href=\"https://www.rics.org/Global/2._WEB_%20February_2018_RICS_UK_Residential_Market_Survey_tp.pdf\">monthly snapshot</a> from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) showed the balance of surveyors reporting an increase in house prices over the last three months fell to zero, worse than forecast, and down from +8 in January. Despite the worrying national picture, there are some pockets of strength; with data from estate agency group YourMove suggesting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/16/london-slump-shrinks-north-south-divide-in-house-prices\">north-west of England had seen the fastest growth in house prices in the UK</a>. Meanwhile, in parts of London prices have fallen by almost 15%. Asking prices are down in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/27/london-property-slump-most-widespread-since-financial-crisis\">more than half of London postcodes</a>.</p> \n<h2>And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month ... the UK won\u2019t save any money from Brexit for the next five years</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/03/payments-zip/giv-3902UMFiW6GZHK12/\" data-alt=\"obr\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/03/payments-zip/giv-3902UMFiW6GZHK12/\">obr</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The bold claim that Britain sent \u00a3350m per week to the EU, which was painted on the side of the leave campaign\u2019s red bus ahead of the referendum, suggested a Brexit vote would mean more money for the NHS. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/13/uk-save-money-brexit-obr-divorce-bill\">the latest estimate</a> from the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggests there will be no savings from Brexit for the next five years. Meanwhile, the OBR also said it reckoned the final cost of Britain\u2019s Brexit \u201cdivorce bill\u201d with Brussels would be about \u00a337.1bn, and that it would be paid until at least 2064. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2018/03/brexit-dashboard-auto\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2017/07/brexit-dashboard-enhancer/v2\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Anne Stevens, the chief executive of GKN, did not have to retract all her weekend statements. One that stands \u2013 and is obviously correct \u2013 is that hedge funds \u201ccould not give a crap\u201d about the engineering firm\u2019s future. Their only interest in Melrose\u2019s \u00a37.9bn hostile bid lies in making money for themselves. Hedge funds, mostly merger arbitrage funds, are estimated to control 20%-25% of GKN\u2019s shares, either directly or though derivative contracts. The size of that collective holding is the reason why Melrose enters the last lap of this contest as favourite to win. New York-based Elliott Capital is voting its 3.8% holding in support of the bid and most of its co-travellers are likely to do the same. If Melrose does indeed succeed on Thursday, does that mean vultures such as Elliott will have dictated the outcome? Sorry, but that narrative is too simple. These avian creatures cannot conjure GKN shares out of nothing. They have to buy, or borrow, stock from somebody. The better question is: who created the speculative opportunity? In many cases, the sellers will be conventional long-only funds \u2013 the same people who happily sign warm and worthy charters declaring themselves to be responsible stewards of capital. Stevens should have taken a pop at them. Some will have flogged the holdings without even waiting to hear GKN\u2019s full defence. Most will not have bothered to ask the ultimate holders, including pension schemes and private investors, which way they\u2019d like their investments to be voted. A popular cry in these situations is to disqualify short-term shareholders from voting on takeover bids. High-profile industrialist Sir John Parker endorsed the idea in the Sunday Times at the weekend, just as Sir Roger Carr, chairman of Cadbury when it fell to Kraft in 2010, did in the past. It\u2019s a nice thought, but there is an obvious flaw. If up to a quarter of GKN\u2019s supposedly core investors have seized the opportunity to flog their holdings in the market for a quick turn, expecting them to be loyal at the end of a two-month takeover campaign is wishful thinking. The ultimate outcome, in all likelihood, would be exactly the same. Disenfranchisement would also extinguish those few occasions (the London Stock Exchange, under siege from Nasdaq in 2006, for example) when hedge funds have been critical in defeating a bid. So, while it\u2019s easy and tempting to rage at hedge funds, it\u2019s futile. Short-termism in the investment industry runs deeper. The only serious way to reform the UK\u2019s free-and-easy approach to takeover bids is to extend the national interest test to cover industrial policy. Melrose might be a problematic case since it is a UK quoted company with mostly UK shareholders. But a proper study of the two sides\u2019 competing break-up visions for GKN would have been in order. The consequences for the automotive and aerospace supply chains, in terms of jobs and investment, could be significant \u2013 under both companies\u2019 plans. Government ministers, we can conclude, are the other people who don\u2019t give a damn, which is more alarming. GKN\u2019s Dana deal shows it is undervalued As for the takeover tussle itself, GKN produced a neat 11th hour twist: it persuaded Dana of the US, the planned buyer of its automotive division, to offer another $140m (\u00a3100m) in cash. The sweetener is minor in the context of the size of the transaction \u2013 but it all helps. The US firm\u2019s share price had fallen since the terms were announced earlier this month, reducing the value of the 47% stake in Dana that GKN investors could collect. The dollar had also slipped against sterling since Donald Trump\u2019s trade war antics. The $140m tickle in effect almost restores the original terms. In itself, that won\u2019t sway many undecided voters. But GKN\u2019s pledge to return \u201cup to\u201d \u00a3700m in cash to its shareholders \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d after the completion of the Dana deal might get noticed. It suggests the spoils from the overall \u00a32.5bn cash-return programme might come sooner than thought. The final stages of contested takeover bids are often about bribing shareholders with their own cash, which investment bankers like to dress up as providing \u201ccertainty\u201d. You can\u2019t blame GKN for giving it a go. It\u2019s the right tactic when the clock is ticking. Analysts at Jefferies reckon the sum of GKN\u2019s parts, after all the post-Dana pension transfers, equates to 487p a share, a figure worth noting. The view here remains the same: regardless of the public-interest angle, bidders should pay proper takeover premiums. Melrose, with a mostly-shares offer worth 455p, would be getting GKN on the cheap.",
