They\u2019ll need to update that shortly, with a pinch of \u201ctradable financial instruments\u201d. Like so many small businesses, 4 Madonne struggles to borrow from the bank right now. Unlike most, however, it has found their solution in the bond markets. The problem for parmesan-makers, similar to the problem faced by whisky distillers, is that their product takes years before it is ready for market \u2013 generally two or three years, in the case of parmesan. In that time, all the money you spent buying milk and paying staff just sits there, in 40kg wheels, maturing, usually gaining value, but sometimes going wrong. It\u2019s like having an employer who pays you well, but three years late. Tricky, unless you can find a loan. Bonds essentially are loans, but instead of paying them back gradually, the borrower pays just a small amount of regular interest for a fixed period, then pays back the whole loan in one go. In this way, 4 Madonne has borrowed \u20ac6m (\u00a34.6m) by issuing \u201cminibonds\u201d, whose owners get a 5% payment every six months until January 2022, when the bonds reach maturity. Should the company fail to pay, or go bankrupt, the bondholders will at least have a pile of maturing cheese that they can sell. Strange as it may sound, parmesan cheese is one of the more familiar sights on the financial markets. In Emilia-Romagna, it is quite normal for banks such as Credem to warehouse thousands of parmesan wheels in climate-controlled vaults, as security for loans they have made to cheesemakers. Recently, however, especially in Britain, minibonds have become a popular way for startups to raise money. In December, Arbikie, a new Scotch whisky distillery, offered its first 300 barrels for sale at \u00a310,000 each, with the promise to buy them back at the same price in eight years\u2019 time (and the prediction that you won\u2019t want to sell, because they will be worth much more). These are essentially \u00a310,000 bonds, and might indeed (or might not) be a good investment. Last April, Innis &amp; Gunn, a Scottish craft brewer, promised to pay investors 7.25% annual interest \u2013 or 9%, if you spent all the money on vouchers for its beer. In the summer of 2014, the Mexican street food chain Chilango raised more than \u00a32m from 709 investors by issuing \u201cburrito bonds\u201d, which not only paid out 8% twice a year for four years, but also entitled bondholders to free food every now and then. Hotel Chocolat did something similar in 2010, raising \u00a33.7m in chocolate bonds, which supplied investors with free samples, as had razormakers King of Shaves in 2009. In fact, bonds crop up in all sorts of places. In 1997, the investment banker David Pullman offered what became known as \u201cBowie bonds\u201d to Wall Street. For a 10-year period, institutional investors received a 7.9% return based on royalty payments for all of David Bowie\u2019s 25 albums recorded before 1990. At the end, they were repaid in full. As a result of the deal, Bowie was able to borrow $55m, from the Prudential Insurance Company of America, and, in 2007 \u2013 after an interesting decade in the music business \u2013 investors got their money back. But there are risks. Investors in 4 Madonne will be hoping there aren\u2019t any cheese-destroying earthquakes in the area for the next six years, like the one in 2012.",

The Indian food producer introduced what it said was an improved recipe for lime pickle early last year. It had less oil, extra lime in smaller chunks and extra kalonji seeds for a peppery flavour. But devotees were horrified. One customer wrote on Patak\u2019s Facebook page: \u201cThe old lime pickle recipe was SO much better.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Next has been criticised by a group of heavyweight investors who say the company failed to act on a warning that could have prevented it from breaking company law, forcing the retail group to hold an expensive shareholder meeting this week. Next said last month it had paid dividends on four occasions without filing accounts at Companies House to show it had the money. The company called a special shareholder meeting for Wednesday at which shareholders will vote on a resolution to rectify the matter. When it announced the error, Next said the matter was a historic \u201cprocedural oversight\u201d. Analysts said it was embarrassing for Lord Wolfson, Next\u2019s chief executive, who is known for his active management of dividends and shareholder returns. The omissions concerned a special dividend paid in February 2014, an ordinary dividend paid in January 2015 and two special dividends paid in February and November 2015. Next\u2019s chairman, John Barton, the finance director and audit committee chairman will be there to face any shareholders who attend. Pirc, the shareholder advisory group, believes the cost of the meeting should be borne by Next\u2019s directors, and not the shareholders. It has emerged that a group of 11 investors and shareholder groups wrote to Next and other FTSE 100 companies in October 2014 asking for clearer reporting of money that can be paid out to shareholders \u2013 known as distributable reserves. The investors, which included the Universities Superannuation Scheme, Threadneedle and Royal London, told companies that without better information shareholders could not be sure a company was solvent. Next replied to the investors\u2019 letter but then made three dividend payments that infringed the 2006 Companies Act. Next had the reserves when it made the payments but it did not update its accounts with Companies House to show this was the case. The fashion chain said that the shareholders\u2019 letter and the shareholder meeting were about separate matters to do with its distributable reserves. \u201cThe issue in question for this general meeting concerns the filing at Companies House of relevant accounts which demonstrate distributable reserves. The question that had been previously raised was around clarity of disclosure in accounts.\u201d But Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at Sarasin &amp; Partners, who co-ordinated the group of shareholders, said Next was wrong to argue the matters were entirely separate. She said: \u201cI am not sure why they are distinguishing between their disclosures to investors in their accounts and the accounts they file at Companies House. Of course, it is important that accounts are filed at Companies House but the point is that distributable reserves must be visible to shareholders too.\u201d To hold the meeting, Next contacted its 12,000 shareholders and paid the investment bank UBS and Allen &amp; Overy, one of Britain\u2019s most expensive law firms, to advise it on the matter. The meeting will take place at Allen &amp; Overy\u2019s offices in the City instead of on the outskirts of Leicester, where the company holds its annual shareholder meetings. Next has declined to say how much the meeting will cost but it told Pirc the total would be less than 0.1% of annual profit, which was \u00a3635,000 last year. A spokesman for Next said the figure was given as rough guidance and that the cost would be substantially less than half that amount. Data from Pircand manifest shows that seven companies on the main market of the stock exchange owned up to the same mistake as Next in the months before the retailer paid the last of the dividends in November 2015. The first was by the online bookmaker Betfair in August 2014, followed by Morrisons, Foxtons and Poundland. Tim Bush, head of governance at Pirc, said Next may face questions about the matter at its annual general meeting in May. He said Next\u2019s recent discovery of the oversight could mean other companies have not yet spotted similar errors.",

      "body": "<p>Next has been criticised by a group of heavyweight investors who say the company failed to act on a warning that could have prevented it from breaking company law, forcing the retail group to hold an expensive shareholder meeting this week.<br></p> <p>Next <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/next-calls-shareholder-meeting-over-dividend-glitch\">said last month it had paid dividends on four occasions without filing accounts </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/next-calls-shareholder-meeting-over-dividend-glitch\">at Companies House</a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/next-calls-shareholder-meeting-over-dividend-glitch\"> to show it had the money</a>. The company called a special shareholder meeting for Wednesday at which shareholders will vote on a resolution to rectify the matter.</p> <p>When it <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/next-plc/rns/publication-of-circular/201601190700052439M/\">announced the error</a>, Next said the matter was a historic \u201cprocedural oversight\u201d. Analysts said it was embarrassing for Lord Wolfson, Next\u2019s chief executive, who is known for his active management of dividends and shareholder returns.</p> <p>The omissions concerned a special dividend paid in February 2014, an ordinary dividend paid in January 2015 and two special dividends paid in February and November 2015.</p> <p>Next\u2019s chairman, John Barton, the finance director and audit committee chairman will be there to face any shareholders who attend. Pirc, the shareholder advisory group, believes the cost of the meeting should be borne by Next\u2019s directors, and not the shareholders.</p> <p>It has emerged that a group of 11 investors and shareholder groups wrote to Next and other FTSE 100 companies in October 2014 asking for clearer reporting of money that can be paid out to shareholders \u2013 known as distributable reserves.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The investors, which included the Universities Superannuation Scheme, Threadneedle and Royal London, told companies that without better information shareholders could not be sure a company was solvent. </p> <p>Next replied to the investors\u2019 letter but then made three dividend payments that infringed the 2006 Companies Act. Next had the reserves when it made the payments but it did not update its accounts with Companies House to show this was the case.</p> <p>The fashion chain said that the shareholders\u2019 letter and the shareholder meeting were about separate matters to do with its distributable reserves.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue in question for this general meeting concerns the filing at Companies House of relevant accounts which demonstrate distributable reserves. The question that had been previously raised was around clarity of disclosure in accounts.\u201d<br></p> <p>But Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at Sarasin &amp; Partners, who co-ordinated the group of shareholders, said Next was wrong to argue the matters were entirely separate. </p> <p>She said: \u201cI am not sure why they are distinguishing between their disclosures to investors in their accounts and the accounts they file at Companies House. Of course, it is important that accounts are filed at Companies House but the point is that distributable reserves must be visible to shareholders too.\u201d</p> <p>To hold the meeting, Next contacted its 12,000 shareholders and paid the investment bank UBS and Allen &amp; Overy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/05/city-law-firms-charging-up-to-1100-an-hour\">one of Britain\u2019s most expensive law firms</a>, to advise it on the matter. The meeting will take place at Allen &amp; Overy\u2019s offices in the City instead of on the outskirts of Leicester, where the company holds its annual shareholder meetings. </p> <p>Next has declined to say how much the meeting will cost but it told Pirc the total would be less than 0.1% of annual profit, which was \u00a3635,000 last year. A spokesman for Next said the figure was given as rough guidance and that the cost would be substantially less than half that amount.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Data from Pircand manifest shows that seven companies on the main market of the stock exchange owned up to the same mistake as Next in the months before the retailer paid the last of the dividends in November 2015. The first was by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/02/betfair-attacks-pirc-accounts\">the online bookmaker Betfair</a> in August 2014, followed by Morrisons, Foxtons and Poundland.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Tim Bush, head of governance at Pirc, said Next may face questions about the matter at its annual general meeting in May. He said Next\u2019s recent discovery of the oversight could mean other companies have not yet spotted similar errors.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Keynes\u2019s General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money is to economics what Joyce\u2019s Ulysses is to literature: a classic that lots more people start than finish. The same applies to two other seminal works from the dismal science: Adam Smith\u2019s Wealth of Nations and Karl Marx\u2019s Capital. It is a fair bet, though, that a good chunk of the Keynes devotees at last week\u2019s British Academy celebration of the 80th anniversary of the publication of the General Theory in February 1936 had ploughed their way through Postulates of the Classical Economy to Notes on Mercantilism, while only occasionally thinking they would rather be reading Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. The event pitched Lord Robert Skidelsky, author of the magnificent three-volume biography of Keynes, in a debate with Sir Nicholas Macpherson, shortly to retire as permanent secretary to the Treasury. Its title, From Keynes to Corbynomics: the General Theory at 80 was a bit of a misnomer because Skidelsky didn\u2019t dwell on the Labour leader\u2019s economic ideas and Macpherson said that, as a civil servant, it wasn\u2019t proper to do so. Instead, the pair took up two themes: whether Keynes and his ideas had made a comeback following the financial and economic crisis of 2007-09, and what Keynes would have made of the handling of the economy by the Treasury since the crash. Skidelsky said there had been no lasting return to Keynesian ideas since the market meltdown, paradoxically because a brief burst of Keynes prevented a 1930s-style collapse that might have led to a more fundamental re-think of the status quo. This seems an accurate assessment. The initial response to the crisis followed Keynes\u2019s ideas pretty much to the letter, with an assumption that action should be taken to prevent what was clearly going to be a painful recession turning into a full-blown depression. Central banks were the first to act. They sought to make money cheaper and more plentiful through deep cuts in interest rates and quantitative easing. Keynes was primarily a monetary economist who believed that governments should only turn to fiscal policy - raising public spending and cutting taxes - when all other options had been exhausted. Fiscal policy was deployed in 2008-09, but only as a supplement to monetary policy. Up to a point, the strategy worked. There was no second Great Depression and within six to nine months output had steadied across most of the global economy. Attempts were then made to return to business as usual as quickly as possible. That meant reducing the budget deficits that had ballooned during the recession and making only cosmetic changes to the debt-driven economic model that had been found wanting from 2007-09. Fiscal policy was relaxed by Alistair Darling during the depths of the crisis, but the Treasury was already returning to a more orthodox approach to the management of the public finances even before Labour left office in 2010. George Osborne then adopted the sort of approach that would have been followed in the early 1930s: using low interest rates and QE to boost growth while at the same time cutting spending and raising taxes in order to rein in the budget deficit. Macpherson said the mix of loose monetary policy and tight fiscal policy had been right, and mounted a robust defence of the Treasury\u2019s reluctance to run deliberately higher deficits in an attempt to boost growth. The nine arguments presented included a lack of \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects for the government to finance, the fear that any increase in demand would benefit foreign importers rather than UK firms, and the likelihood that individuals and businesses would anticipate that spending increases now would necessitate tax increases or spending cuts later, and reduce consumer spending and investment as a result. One questioner asked whether Macpherson was right to say that Keynes would have approved of the government\u2019s economic strategy since 2008. \u201cOf course not\u201d, Skidelsky snorted. So what would Keynes say if he were still alive today and updating the General Theory? Firstly, that one of the book\u2019s main themes - the difference between risk and uncertainty - has been borne out by the financial crisis. Keynes argued that risk could be quantified but uncertainty could not, which made all the algorithms that sought to measure the riskiness of complex financial instruments useless in a market gripped by panic. The second lesson he would draw would be of the need to rethink the way economics is taught, with a much reduced emphasis on mathematical models and the restoration to the curriculum of economic history. His third conclusion would be that the global financial system has been made more vulnerable by the stripping away of controls that hindered the free movement of capital. Supporters of capital liberalisation argue that it makes financial markets more efficient, but Keynes said efficient markets were not necessarily effective markets and drew a distinction between capital used for productive purposes and capital used for speculation. The story of the years leading up to the crisis (and the years since, for that matter) is that there was too much of the latter and not enough of the former. The fourth lesson would be contained in a special chapter in the 2016 edition of the General Theory devoted to the eurozone. Keynes would have been at his most acerbic in detailing the manifold failings of monetary union, from its flawed design to the succession of avoidable blunders made by the European Central Bank and European finance ministers since 2007. Seeking an explanation for why the eurozone has performed so poorly in the past eight years, Keynes would say the answer is simple: the ECB was not only slow to cut interest rates but raised them twice in 2011; it took more than half a decade longer than the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England to get round to QE; and, most damagingly of all, European policymakers insisted on austerity programmes that resulted in still weaker growth and even higher levels of unemployment. Fiscal policy becomes even more important in a monetary union, because individual countries give up the right to set their own interest rates and to devalue (or revalue) their currencies. In the fifth and final lesson, Keynes would seek to explain why the recovery from the crash had, so far at least, been tentative and incomplete. His argument would have been that cutting interest rates to zero and boosting the money supply through QE were enough to halt the downward spiral in 2009 but not sufficient to bring about a lasting recovery. Keynes would say the way to achieve this would be through a global growth pact, including more aggressive use of fiscal policy. His detractors would say what\u2019s needed is a dose of Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s \u201ccreative destruction\u201d so that new, dynamic enterprises can replace old, inefficient ones. In truth, policy is neither Keynesian nor Schumpeterian, which is why we are where we are.",

      "bodyText": "Early Friday afternoon, Barack Obama took the stage at the White House briefing room to announce that the US unemployment rate had dropped below 5% for the first time since February 2008. Under the president\u2019s tenure, unemployment has more than halved. But there\u2019s a growing stain on the labor market, and the latest jobs report by the US Department of Labor may contain evidence it is growing \u2013 huge numbers of jobs are being lost as low oil prices lead to layoffs across the energy sector and the communities that rely upon it. The oil industry seems to be a blemish on otherwise mostly impressive recovery. With oil prices plunging below $30, the energy industry has made significant job cuts. Overall, the energy industry \u2013 gas, oil, coal \u2013 has seen employment drop by 6.6% over the last year. Some 104,514 jobs were lost in oil last year, up from 4,137 in 2014. According to Keith Philips, assistant vice president and senior economist at the San Antonio branch of Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, six states saw negative annualized job growth. Even as the national unemployment rate inched down, the rates in these \u201cenergy\u201d states \u2013 Oklahoma, Alaska, Louisiana, Wyoming, West Virginia and North Dakota \u2013 rose for periods of months at a time. Texas, which ranked third in job growth in 2014, dropped to 32nd place in 2015. North Dakota went from first to the very last. \u201cTexas is much more diversified than the other energy states,\u201d explained Philips. \u201cIt is possible that jobs will decline in Texas if oil prices average between $20 and $30 per barrel this year. Much of the weakening will take place in Houston \u2013 with the metro areas declining by up to 1%. Under this scenario, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio would slow from their strong pace of growth in 2015 but still see positive job growth.\u201d \u2018Most companies have cut back their exploration\u2019 BP and Shell were among the energy firms to announce layoffs in the recent weeks. BP will cut 4,000 jobs from its exploration arm and 3,000 jobs from \u201cdownstream\u201d refining; many of those jobs are in Houston. And a merger between Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group will eliminate 10,000 jobs in 2015-2016, according to Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben Van Beurden. Even though the oil industry is used to ups and downs in its prices, there is \u201cno way for companies to get completely in front of those changes\u201d, said John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, a global outplacement company that keeps track of layoffs. In January, the energy sector planned to cut 20,246 jobs, up from 1,682 in December. \u201cMost companies have cut back their exploration. They are cutting back on their operations that are not as profitable but are more expensive to get energy out of the ground. Energy companies are realistic that there could be more supply coming on the market, that demand is still down,\u201d explained Challenger. The problem facing the oil industry right now is the oversupply of oil. Even as oil flooded the market, demand went down. As a result, oil prices have fallen below $30 a barrel. At the moment, it is not profitable for companies to continue producing oil at the rate that they have been \u2013 as their current supply has dropped in value. Since 2008, US production of oil has gone up by 90%. The US currently has almost 503m barrels of commercial crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration. That\u2019s the highest level of oil supply for this time of the year in at least 80 years. As oil companies cut back on their production, they are not just cutting staff in the field. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be everyone from administrative assistants, to engineers, geologists and geophysicists \u2013 everyone you need to run an oil company,\u201d John Grave, president of Graves &amp; Co, told the Houston Chronicle. \u201cIf you want to stay in your profession, it makes life very difficult.\u201d That might depend on your skill set, Challenger said. According to him, companies are likely to try and hold on to engineers and highly skilled niche workers, \u201cbecause those people are hard to find when times are good\u201d. And while layoffs in the energy sector have also affected white-collar workers such as accountants and IT people, they should have an easier time finding a job. \u201cThey are coming into a very favorable labor market where they can change industries to areas that are doing well and be OK,\u201d Challenger said. \u201cPeople who lose their jobs in a very strong labor economy are in a much better shape than when the unemployment is very high.\u201d It is, however, rare that laid-off energy sector employees enter into such a strong labor market. \u201cThis is unusual even with the US economy growing strongly and a big drop in drilling. Normally, US or global recession pulls down oil prices, and there is a double blow,\u201d said Robert Gilmer, director of Bauer Institute for Regional Forecasting at University of Houston. \u201cWe went through 2015 with the best year for job growth since the late 1990s for the US, even with the oil employment turning down.\u201d Oil tax On Thursday, the White House announced that in the budget proposal sent to Congress on Tuesday, it included a $10 fee per barrel of oil imported into the US. US-produced oil would not be subject to that kind of a fee, creating what Obama administration considers to be a level playing field for American producers. Such a proposal is dead on arrival in a Republican-held Congress, yet it can help convey a message to the energy sector: focus on innovation in clean energy and produce less oil. \u201cGas prices are expected to be low for a while, for a foreseeable future,\u201d Obama said on Friday. \u201cThat overall can be a good thing for the economy, but what is also important is that we use this period when gas prices are low to accelerate transition to a cleaner energy economy because we know that\u2019s not going to last.\u201d Obama\u2019s administration conceded that if the tax were enacted, some companies might pass some of the costs on to the consumers. \u201cThe White House thinks Americans are not paying enough for gasoline,\u201d said Jack Gerard, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, clearly implying that such a proposal would drive up prices for the consumers. Over the past few months, the Obama administration repeatedly told the Guardian that it is monitoring the job losses in the energy sector caused by low oil prices. On the other hand, the US secretary of labor, Tom Perez, said cheap oil prices act like a tax cut for consumers, putting money back in their pockets. \u201cEnergy prices have such a complicated effect on US economy, because energy prices for many consumers act like a tax,\u201d agreed Challenger, adding that consumers have more cash in their wallets. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the companies that don\u2019t have to spend much on their energy bills, but obviously it hits the energy sector hard. There are losses as well.\u201d",

But there\u2019s a growing stain on the labor market, and the latest jobs report by the US Department of Labor may contain evidence it is growing \u2013 huge numbers of jobs are being lost as low oil prices lead to layoffs across the energy sector and the communities that rely upon it. </p> <p>The oil industry seems to be a blemish on otherwise mostly impressive recovery. With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/17/oil-price-slump-true-cost-uk-economy\">oil prices plunging</a> below $30, the energy industry has made significant job cuts. Overall, the energy industry \u2013 gas, oil, coal \u2013 has seen employment drop by 6.6% over the last year.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has appointed Sir Philip Hampton, one of Britain\u2019s most highly regarded bosses, to push for more women in top management jobs at large companies. Hampton, the chairman of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), will chair an independent review on increasing the number of female executives at Britain\u2019s 350 biggest public companies. Dame Helen Alexander, who chairs the media company UBM, will be Hampton\u2019s deputy. The review will build on the work by Mervyn Davies to get more women on to company boards. Lord Davies\u2019s recommendations in 2011 spurred FTSE 100 companies to increase female board representation from 12.5% to 26%, beating his target of 25%. The figure for mid-size companies in the FTSE 250 was lower at almost 20%. Davies called in October for women to make up at least a third of board directors by 2020 and widened the scope of his target to all FTSE 350 companies. He recommended a steering committee with a new chairman to achieve the target, starting with getting women into senior managerial jobs below board level. Most of the women appointed to boards since 2011 have been non-executive directors, whose job is to oversee the decisions of chief executives and other top managers. The number of FTSE 100 female executive directors almost doubled from 2011-15 but was still fewer than one in 10. Davies said more work was needed to get women into top executive jobs and in line to become senior independent directors. As with his earlier target, he rejected compulsory quotas in favour of encouraging companies to take part. Hampton said: \u201cI will focus on improving representation in the executive layer of companies, as well as maintaining the momentum on boards. This means looking at the talent pipeline for female executives and emerging non-executive directors to ensure we create opportunities and the right conditions for women to succeed.\u201d Hampton has led some of Britain\u2019s biggest companies. Before joining GSK last year he was chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland and, before that, chair of Sainsbury\u2019s. His other jobs include finance director at British Gas, BT and Lloyds TSB. Alexander is a non-executive director at Rolls-Royce and Huawei UK. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI employers\u2019 lobby, said Hampton\u2019s review should aim for a quarter of senior executive jobs occupied by women. She said: \u201cDiverse voices make for better business decisions \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s right to focus on getting more women in executive roles, because they take daily decisions, shape and define strategy, and influence culture through the everyday examples that they set.\u201d Concern about the makeup of boards was heightened by the financial crisis, which exposed a lack of scrutiny by overwhelmingly male non-executives from similar backgrounds to the managers they were meant to oversee. Research suggests women in business are not only more wary of risk than men but that companies with women at the top are more successful and in tune with their customers because their boards have a wider range of views. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said the push for more female executives was not about diversity for its own sake but would instead improve performance at Britain\u2019s top companies. \u201cThere are now more women on FTSE boards than ever before but we need to go further, particularly when it comes to paving the way to the executive level. Companies cannot afford to miss out on the skills and talent of the whole population if the UK is going to compete in a fast-moving global economy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce is poised to cut its dividend payment to shareholders for the first time in almost 25 years, underlining the crisis at the famous engineering group. The dividend cut will be a blow to Britain\u2019s leading pension funds, who are amongst the biggest shareholders in the FTSE 100 company. Rolls has issued five profit warnings in the last two years and Warren East, chief executive, is likely to warn there are more struggles ahead when he unveils the engineer\u2019s full-year results this week. The company makes engines for the Airbus A380 superjumbo, the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet, and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It also builds the nuclear-powered propulsion system for Britain\u2019s submarines and parts for ships. However, the company has been hurt by cuts to defence spending by western governments, a fall in demand for corporate jets, and a slump in the oil price, which has meant Rolls\u2019 customers in the energy industry are investing less. Rolls is also paying the price for its decision to pull out of the market for single-aisle aeroplanes. The demand for smaller planes is growing quickly, while orders of larger planes such as the A380 have slowed. East has already revealed that he wants to cut costs by up to \u00a3200m a year to get the company back on track. Senior executives have left, while 50 out of the company\u2019s 200 managers will lose their job. The cut to the dividend will further help to shore up Rolls\u2019 balance sheet. Last year the company paid almost \u00a3500m to shareholders with a dividend worth 23.1p per share. The last time Rolls cut its dividend was in 1992 as the UK fell into a deep recession. However, it is understood that Rolls is not considering a rights issue as a way to boost its funding. The pressure on Rolls has been increased by ValueAct, an activist investor based in California, building a 10% holding in Rolls and pushing for a seat on the board. Rolls is also mired in a Serious Fraud Office investigation about bribery allegations in China, Indonesia and other parts of the world. Analysts fear that Rolls could also warn on profits for a sixth time in its results. The consensus in the City is that Rolls will post underlying pre-tax profits of \u00a31.3bn for 2015, down 20% on the previous year and below the company\u2019s guidance of \u00a31.325bn to \u00a31,475bn. However, 2016 could be much worse, with analysts predicting pre-tax profits will almost halve to \u00a3673m. Jaime Rowbotham, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: \u201cWhile civil [aerospace] issues are well flagged, continued weakness in power systems and marine means a risk of more disappointment. As a result, it is hard to establish a sustainable level of future profit for Rolls and when that might be achieved.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne might be running out of friends when next month\u2019s budget arrives. Like every chancellor before him, he likes to distribute goodies to lift the spirits of his backbench colleagues. More than that, he will want to offset the worst effects of the Treasury\u2019s austerity measures. This he did in spectacular fashion at last November\u2019s autumn statement when higher GDP growth forecasts for the next five years allowed him to scrap planned cuts in tax credits. Maybe not this time. The Bank of England has downgraded its forecasts for the UK\u2019s GDP growth and the outlook for wages, most likely robbing the exchequer of vital income tax receipts. And without the funds to maintain pensions and health service spending, his critics will gleefully play back the speech from last November during which he declared that Britain was on the road to becoming \u201cthe most prosperous and secure of all the major nations of the world\u201d. The IPPR thinktank has made the point that tax receipts will fall from their predicted level \u201cboth for the remaining three months of the 2015-16 fiscal year, and for the rest of 2016\u201d. It says: \u201cWith the chancellor having already borrowed more by December 2015 than he had budgeted for the entire fiscal year, the Bank\u2019s revised assessment of the economic outlook suggests that not even a self-assessment tax receipt bonanza in January will be enough to avoid a significant overshoot of the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecast for government borrowing.\u201d Osborne himself said: \u201cA weaker outlook for GDP, if realised, could present challenges for tax receipts in the future.\u201d A double whammy for Osborne will be the OBR\u2019s own forecasts, which are likely to be revised downwards. In the autumn statement he found an extra \u00a327bn from the OBR\u2019s surprisingly optimistic view of Britain\u2019s fortunes over the next five years. It was this largesse that allowed him to scrap the cuts to tax credits. A reversal will force him to borrow more or make steeper cuts. Neither is easy to explain in the current political climate to backbenchers already restive as a Brexit vote approaches. That said, he can always count on the loyalty of Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor. Osborne knows there is a chance he can prevent a revolt over cuts to public services if interest rates stay low. So he needs the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, to recognise that the proper counterweight to weak growth forecasts is a further delay to the much-promised first rise in interest rates since the financial crash. In its quarterly inflation report, the MPC obliged. Most analysts put back a rise from 0.5% to later this year or 2017. One bank, Morgan Stanley, pencilled in September 2018. That gives mortgage-payers and the chancellor some breathing space. While interest rates remain low, consumers are likely to carry on spending, insulated to some extent from concerns about jittery global markets, currency wars and weak export numbers. Carney, not wishing to be blamed for the next consumer borrowing binge or housing bubble, warned the British public it would be wrong to bet against a rate rise. It could still happen sooner than expected. Yet his words ring hollow when so many of the post-crash problems are still with us, from the burden of high private and public debts to Europe\u2019s rapidly ageing population, which encourage saving over investment, and a reluctance from government and big business to boost capital spending. These are global issues that keep interrupting the UK\u2019s recovery and will be a drag on growth for many years to come. For that reason Carney and his MPC colleagues will sit on their hands, possibly for years, and for their inaction earn themselves a drink on Osborne\u2019s tab. Staley can\u2019t tread water while Barclays\u2019 shares sink \u2018Our stock price is broadly where it was immediately after the global financial crisis, six years ago,\u201d said Barclays chairman John McFarlane last July, sympathising with the bank\u2019s \u201cincredibly patient\u201d investors and vowing to \u201caccelerate the delivery of shareholder value\u201d. His observation about the share price is now out of date.

If Staley and McFarlane disagree, they\u2019d better be able to show how the unhappy relationship is meant to work. To many observers, it looks fundamentally dysfunctional. The grand plan, if there is one, will be unveiled next month. More dithering \u2013 which was what did for Antony Jenkins, Staley\u2019s predecessor \u2013 won\u2019t cut it. And, at today\u2019s share price, shareholders\u2019 incredible patience would quickly turn to credible impatience. Rail delivers first-class returns \u2013 but not for passengers Last week, two decades to the day since the first privatised train service rolled into London Waterloo, the Department for Transport unveiled its shortlist for the next firm to run that same south-west franchise. Which operator, incidentally, operated that first train? Stagecoach. Which one won the next two franchise terms? Stagecoach. Which one was then awarded the contract unopposed? You get the idea. Now, Stagecoach simply has to beat off the challenge of its financially enfeebled rival, FirstGroup, to win the contract again. Rail privatisation was forced on an unwilling public with the promise of services improved by competition and choice. In reality, the contest for franchises is fought by a small group of familiar names, led by the likes of Stagecoach and FirstGroup. While weary commuters pay ever more for tickets, Stagecoach\u2019s chairman and major shareholder, Sir Brian Souter, enjoys the considerable fortune he has made from privatised transport. There really could not have been a more fitting way to mark the anniversary than to announce more of the same.",

Osborne knows there is a chance he can prevent a revolt over cuts to public services if interest rates stay low.</p> <p>So he needs the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, to recognise that the proper counterweight to weak growth forecasts is a further delay to the much-promised first rise in interest rates since the financial crash. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/bank-of-england-votes-9-0-to-keep-interest-rates-on-hold\" title=\"\">In its quarterly inflation report</a>, the MPC obliged. Most analysts put back a rise from 0.5% to later this year or 2017. One bank, Morgan Stanley, pencilled in September 2018.</p> <p>That gives mortgage-payers and the chancellor some breathing space. While interest rates remain low, consumers are likely to carry on spending, insulated to some extent from concerns about jittery global markets, currency wars and weak export numbers.</p> <p>Carney, not wishing to be blamed for the next consumer borrowing binge or housing bubble, warned the British public it would be wrong to bet against a rate rise. It could still happen sooner than expected.</p> <p>Yet his words ring hollow when so many of the post-crash problems are still with us, from the burden of high private and public debts to Europe\u2019s rapidly ageing population, which encourage saving over investment, and a reluctance from government and big business to boost capital spending.</p> <p>These are global issues that keep interrupting the UK\u2019s recovery and will be a drag on growth for many years to come. For that reason Carney and his MPC colleagues will sit on their hands, possibly for years, and for their inaction earn themselves a drink on Osborne\u2019s tab.</p> <h2>Staley can\u2019t tread water while Barclays\u2019 shares sink</h2> <p>\u2018Our stock price is broadly where it was immediately after the global financial crisis, six years ago,\u201d said Barclays chairman John McFarlane last July, sympathising with the bank\u2019s \u201cincredibly patient\u201d investors and vowing to \u201caccelerate the delivery of shareholder value\u201d.</p> <p>His observation about the share price is now out of date. Barclays has plunged from 280p to 173p \u2013 back to where it was in the dark days of 2012 when Bob Diamond was forced to resign as chief executive.</p> <p>Most banks have slumped in value since last summer, it should be said. Financial stocks, especially those with investment banks, like Barclays, don\u2019t like falling stock markets. The plunging oil price has brought worries about bad debts in the offing. Regulators are not going soft on their capital demands.</p> <p>In Barclays\u2019 case, there\u2019s a deeper worry. What\u2019s the strategy? Does Jes Staley, McFarlane\u2019s pick as the latest chief executive, have a radical reinvention plan? Or is he going to offer another uninspiring round of cost-cutting?</p> <p>Never let a good crisis go to waste, advised Bernstein\u2019s analysts, in an open letter to Staley. Their radical formula: get out of Africa, sell the US credit card business, and carve out the investment bank and promise to float it in the US, in effect unwinding Diamond\u2019s purchase of the rump of Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>The latter idea is the big one and would require Staley and McFarlane to swallow hard. But Bernstein is right that housing a US investment bank inside a UK retail bank is \u201can absolute investment nightmare\u201d in the new regulatory era. If Staley and McFarlane disagree, they\u2019d better be able to show how the unhappy relationship is meant to work. To many observers, it looks fundamentally dysfunctional.</p> <p>The grand plan, if there is one, will be unveiled next month. More dithering \u2013 which was what did for Antony Jenkins, Staley\u2019s predecessor \u2013 won\u2019t cut it. And, at today\u2019s share price, shareholders\u2019 incredible patience would quickly turn to credible impatience.</p> <h2>Rail delivers first-class returns \u2013 but not for passengers</h2> <p>Last week, two decades to the day since the first privatised train service rolled into London Waterloo, the Department for Transport unveiled its shortlist for the next firm to run that same south-west franchise. Which operator, incidentally, operated that first train? Stagecoach. Which one won the next two franchise terms? Stagecoach. Which one was then awarded the contract unopposed? You get the idea. Now, Stagecoach simply has to beat off the challenge of its financially enfeebled rival, FirstGroup, to win the contract again.</p> <p>Rail privatisation was forced on an unwilling public with the promise of services improved by competition and choice. In reality, the contest for franchises is fought by a small group of familiar names, led by the likes of Stagecoach and FirstGroup. While weary commuters pay ever more for tickets, Stagecoach\u2019s chairman and major shareholder, Sir Brian Souter, enjoys the considerable fortune he has made from privatised transport. There really could not have been a more fitting way to mark the anniversary than to announce more of the same.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brothers Bill and Jim Mitchell shared a passion for homebrewed beer but, when they shared a recipe, the pair could never seem to get the same result. Although Jim\u2019s Angry Amber was his best beer, Bill could not replicate it even though their brewing systems were largely identical. It\u2019s a common problem for home brewers. Producing a consistent-tasting batch of beer depends on the fickle brewing process, where a subtle change involving the barley and hops can result in very different products. Bill, a former Microsoft executive, set out to apply science to the homebrewing process. \u201cWe said that the end goal is to build an every-person countertop craft beer machine that can brew just like the professional breweries do and give all the level of process control and repeatability to get a great tasting craft beer batch in your home,\u201d he said. The result, they claim, is the Pico, a machine with a passing resemblance to a microwave. It brews 5-litre batches of beers after the exact ingredients are fed via pods into the device much like coffee being loaded into a Nespresso machine. The 14kg machine works by loading water with PicoPaks of ingredients, and then brewed for about two hours. The beer recipes come from various breweries but the bitterness, thickness and alcohol volume can be adjusted at home. After the brewing process, the beer is transferred to a keg to ferment for about a week. The aim, says Seattle-based Mitchell, is to engage amateurs by brewing consistent beer each and every time by eliminating the frequent possibility of \u201cbad batches\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what went wrong, you can\u2019t track back. If you are at all scientific, it drives you nuts and usually for most people that is it. You just wasted eight hours, a fair amount of money. You thought you did everything right and you produce a bad batch. There are just so many ways that a batch could go bad.\u201d About 2,000 of the machines have been preordered and are expected to ship from April. The early bird price was $500 (\u00a3340) and this is expected to rise to $999 at retail. The PicoPaks are available from the company\u2019s website, among them pale ales, porter and a strong English bitter. Another aim is to make beers from different parts of the world available and customisable. \u201cIf you tasted Rogue Dead Guy Ale from one of the popular Oregon breweries, it is a great beer. It is pretty high alcohol at 8% and if you really enjoy that beer, you are going to have a hard time enjoying more than a couple of pints of it at a time unless you have a pretty big liver. But if you were to scale it down and turn it into a session beer and crank it down to perhaps 4% alcohol, then it is a whole different beer.\u201d Costs for the different pods vary from $18 to $30, meaning substantial savings for high-end beers and minor savings for mainstream drinks, says Mitchell. \u201cIf you go to a commercial chain and you buy a Heineken mini keg, those cost about $19 or $20 and if you are making some style of beer which is very like that the PicoPak would probably cost you $16 or $17,\u201d he says. The growing interest in craft beers \u2013 Mitchell says there were 1m homebrewers in the US when they started their company PicoBrew in 2010 \u2013 has created a demand for niche beers from around the world but not necessarily any demand for the intricate system of sourcing and measuring hops and grains out, he says. In Belfast, Northern Ireland, where many pubs are tied to suppliers and their particular range of drinks, the limited selection of craft beers on offer led to the creation of Brewbot. The 4ft square brewing machine made from stainless steel and wood produces 30 litres of beer each time. The four founders aim to sell the device to bars, restaurants and offices to create and brew their own beer. Existing brewers have also bought the machines to make test batches of experimental recipes while some companies station them in offices for staff to enjoy, adding another layer of staff perks now synonymous with tech firms. Ingredients can be ordered and recipes downloaded. If they prefer, homebrewers can go off-piste and create their own blends. Brewbotting a batch of beer can take between four and six hours. The beer then ferments elsewhere for an average of between two to four weeks. The Brewbot can then be used to make further batches of 90 bottles. An app notifies the user of the various different stages of the brewing process after the recipe is chosen. Since the machine is not totally autonomous, the app tells the user when they need to step in. The Belfast-based firm, has sold 150 units so far to various bars, restaurants and companies as well as breweries. Brewbot chief executive, Chris McClelland, says the machines allow restaurants to experiment with new types of beer, just as cafes dream up specific coffee recipes by mixing different bean. \u201cIt allows chefs to apply a chef mentality to brewing,\u201d he says. At \u00a36,900, the machine is beyond the budget of most home brewers and is aimed more at a commercial market. The end price of a beer from the machine depends on factors such as the costs of shelf space in a restaurant or how long it takes to brew, McClelland says. Asked if it isn\u2019t easier to just buy a crate of bottled beer, he replies: \u201cDo people have that attitude with their food?\u201d \u2022You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "bodyText": "One of the key negotiators of the terms of UK entry to the European Economic Community in the early 1970s went down in history as a loyal servant of prime minister Edward Heath, but himself had doubts about the entire venture. The man in question, who is, as they say, no longer with us, would no doubt have been of great interest to the present band of Eurosceptics whom David Cameron is trying, if not exactly to win over, at least to pacify. His view was simple, and could be broadly paraphrased as: \u201cWhy did we fight the second world war if we end up doing this?\u201d Well, the answer is that the dissident gentleman\u2019s colleagues and political masters had come to see the truth of former US secretary of state Dean Acheson\u2019s view that, as a result of the second world war, we had lost an empire and not yet found a role. Now we are in a European Union whose birth and expansion we encouraged, but did not apply to join until it became clear in the 1950s and 1960s that \u201cthe six\u201d, as they were then known \u2013 West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg \u2013 were doing far better economically than we were. When Sir Samuel Brittan and I \u2013 both of the Financial Times at the time \u2013 had lunch in the early 1970s with the negotiator referred to above, we asked about the thorny issue of the Common Agricultural Policy. \u201cOh,\u201d said our interlocutor, \u201conce we are in, we\u2019ll change all that.\u201d It says something for the loyalty of the British civil service that it was only decades later that I learned about the \u201cdoubts\u201d harboured by Heath\u2019s distinguished negotiator at the time. As for \u201cchanging all that\u201d, it has been a long haul, and Cameron is still at it, convincing sceptics up to a point. Let us hope he succeeds. Cameron intrigues that great chronicler of British prime ministers, Dick Leonard. Dick, who is also an expert on Europe, having covered the EU for many years on behalf of the Economist and this newspaper, has just produced a magisterial work entitled A History of British Prime Ministers, Walpole to Cameron. Obviously the judgment on Cameron must be tentative, but I note Leonard concludes: \u201cBehind his bland exterior, David Cameron is a single-minded and ruthless operator.\u201d He gives credit to Cameron \u201cfor holding his coalition together\u201d but criticises him for having been \u201cover-dependent on his chancellor (perhaps his Svengali?) for a sense of direction to his government\u201d. His chancellor is now about to lose another great civil servant, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, who, after a long stint as permanent secretary to the Treasury, is retiring from the service in his mid-50s, but not retiring altogether. It is a great tribute to the civil service that quintessential public servants such as Macpherson can work with, and enjoy the trust of, ministers of different parties, and indeed of journalists. Thus, although he did think Labour had rather overdone it with spending, he had no hesitation in dismissing the all too successful Osborne propaganda that public spending had caused the financial crisis, stating unequivocally that what brought the economy to its knees was \u201ca banking crisis, pure and simple.\u201d Now, you would not expect Macpherson to be anything other than a defender of Treasury orthodoxy and, sure enough, in a paper presented to the British Academy last week \u2013 \u201cThe General Theory at 80: Keynes and Treasury Policymaking Today\u201d \u2013 he defended what I regard as the seriously mistaken approach to fiscal policy in recent years. Indeed, he said: \u201cI\u2019d like to think that Maynard Keynes \u2013 who understood markets as well as anybody \u2013 would have approved of what the Treasury has done since 2008.\u201d Now, it is important to remember at this stage, as Macpherson reminded us, that Keynes was essentially addressing the problem of \u201cchronically low demand\u201d in the economy. But Keynes died in 1946. All that stuff about \u201cKeynesians\u201d advocating policies to encourage growth came later. The idea that Keynesian policies do not work was belied by the way that the huge \u201cstimulus\u201d \u2013 fiscal as well as monetary \u2013 championed by Gordon Brown and other enlightened policymakers in 2009 worked brilliantly in preventing the Great Recession of 2008-09 turning into another Great Depression. To my mind the huge, indeed catastrophic, mistake was in tightening fiscal policy too soon, something that began with Alistair Darling\u2019s budget of 2010 and was continued, with a vengeance, by George Osborne. Over centuries, we had until recently experienced economic growth in this country of some 2-2.5% a year; beneath these averages were spurts of growth of 4-5% during recoveries from recession. Although the government goes on about the recent recovery, it is peanuts by comparison with earlier recoveries from recession. Indeed, given the depths plumbed during the Great Recession, it should have been one hell of a lot faster. As it is, output is some 15-20% below what historical trends would have indicated. With due respect to Macpherson, I cannot agree with the Treasury view that Keynes would have approved of the decision to tighten fiscal policy as soon as 2010 and then embark on a programme of austerity. And by the way: in a nice touch, Macpherson revealed that his grandfather had been Keynes\u2019s stockbroker!",

      "body": "<p>One of the key negotiators of the terms of UK entry to the European Economic Community in the early 1970s went down in history as a loyal servant of prime minister Edward Heath, but himself had doubts about the entire venture.</p> <p>The man in question, who is, as they say, no longer with us, would no doubt have been of great interest to the present band of Eurosceptics whom David Cameron is trying, if not exactly to win over, at least to pacify. His view was simple, and could be broadly paraphrased as: \u201cWhy did we fight the second world war if we end up doing&#xa0;this?\u201d</p> <p>Well, the answer is that the dissident gentleman\u2019s colleagues and political masters had come to see the truth of former US secretary of state Dean Acheson\u2019s view that, as a result of the second world war, we had lost an empire and not yet found a role. Now we are in a European Union whose birth and expansion we encouraged, but did not apply to join until it became clear in the 1950s and 1960s that \u201cthe six\u201d, as they were then known \u2013 West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg \u2013 were doing far better economically than we were.</p> <p>When Sir Samuel Brittan and I \u2013 both of the <em>Financial Times</em> at the time \u2013 had lunch in the early 1970s with the negotiator referred to above, we asked about the thorny issue of the Common Agricultural Policy. \u201cOh,\u201d said our interlocutor, \u201conce we are in, we\u2019ll change all that.\u201d</p> <p>It says something for the loyalty of the British civil service that it was only decades later that I learned about the \u201cdoubts\u201d harboured by Heath\u2019s distinguished negotiator at the time. As for \u201cchanging all that\u201d, it has been a long haul, and Cameron is still at it, convincing sceptics up to a point. Let us hope he succeeds.</p> <p>Cameron intrigues that great chronicler of British prime ministers, Dick Leonard. Dick, who is also an expert on Europe, having covered the EU for many years on behalf of the <em>Economist </em>and this newspaper, has just produced a magisterial work entitled <em>A History of British Prime Ministers, Walpole to Cameron</em>.</p> <p>Obviously the judgment on Cameron must be tentative, but I note Leonard concludes: \u201cBehind his bland exterior, David Cameron is a single-minded and ruthless operator.\u201d He gives credit to Cameron \u201cfor holding his coalition together\u201d but criticises him for having been \u201cover-dependent on his chancellor (perhaps his Svengali?) for a sense of direction to his government\u201d.</p> <p>His chancellor is now about to lose another great civil servant, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, who, after a long stint as permanent secretary to the Treasury, is retiring from the service in his mid-50s, but not retiring altogether.</p> <p>It is a great tribute to the civil service that quintessential public servants such as Macpherson can work with, and enjoy the trust of, ministers of different parties, and indeed of journalists. Thus, although he did think Labour had rather overdone it with spending, he had no hesitation in dismissing the all too successful Osborne propaganda that public spending had caused the financial crisis, stating unequivocally that what brought the economy to its knees was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/03/senior-tory-financial-crash-was-purely-a-banking-crisis-not-labour-overspend\" title=\"\">a banking crisis, pure and simple</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Now, you would not expect Macpherson to be anything other than a defender of Treasury orthodoxy and, sure enough, in a paper presented to the British Academy last week \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/permanent-secretary-to-the-treasury-on-the-general-theory-at-80\" title=\"\">The General Theory at 80: Keynes and Treasury Policymaking Today</a>\u201d \u2013 he defended what I regard as the seriously mistaken approach to fiscal policy in recent years. Indeed, he said: \u201cI\u2019d like to think that Maynard Keynes \u2013 who understood markets as well as anybody \u2013 would have approved of what the Treasury has done since 2008.\u201d</p> <p>Now, it is important to remember at this stage, as Macpherson reminded us, that Keynes was essentially addressing the problem of \u201cchronically low demand\u201d in the economy. But Keynes died in 1946. All that stuff about \u201cKeynesians\u201d advocating policies to encourage growth came later.</p> <p>The idea that Keynesian policies do not work was belied by the way that the huge \u201cstimulus\u201d \u2013 fiscal as well as monetary \u2013 championed by Gordon Brown and other enlightened policymakers in 2009 worked brilliantly in preventing the Great Recession of 2008-09 turning into another Great Depression.</p> <p>To my mind the huge, indeed catastrophic, mistake was in tightening fiscal policy too soon, something that began with Alistair Darling\u2019s budget of 2010 and was continued, with a vengeance, by George Osborne.</p> <p>Over centuries, we had until recently experienced economic growth in this country of some 2-2.5% a year; beneath these averages were spurts of growth of 4-5% during recoveries from recession.</p> <p>Although the government goes on about the recent recovery, it is peanuts by comparison with earlier recoveries from recession. Indeed, given the depths plumbed during the Great Recession, it should have been one hell of a lot faster. As it is, output is some 15-20% below what historical trends would have indicated.</p> <p>With due respect to Macpherson, I cannot agree with the Treasury view that Keynes would have approved of the decision to tighten fiscal policy as soon as 2010 and then embark on a programme of austerity.</p> <p>And by the way: in a nice touch, Macpherson revealed that his grandfather had been Keynes\u2019s stockbroker!</p>",
