      "bodyText": "The banking industry has come under fresh scrutiny after the Financial Services Authority ordered Barclays to overhaul its culture and its boardroom following the appointment of its new chief executive, Antony Jenkins. The chairman of the FSA, Lord Turner, wrote to Barclays' chairman-designate, Sir David Walker, saying that despite boardroom changes in the wake of the Libor scandal the culture of the bank still needed to improve. Turner's letter came hours after the FSA's managing director, Martin Wheatley, launched a scathing attack on the industry for bonuses linked to sales targets that cause mis-selling scandals. On Thursday night the boss of Lloyds Banking Group said changes to bonus schemes were under way after the bailed-out bank was revealed to be at risk of an FSA fine for the way it rewards staff. In a speech to business leaders in Scotland, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, Lloyds chief executive, also attacked the banking industry for being \"complacent about risk, running unsustainable business models and extending credit to doubtful clients without due thought\" in the runup to the crisis. In his letter, Turner put Barclays on notice that naming Jenkins to succeed Bob Diamond \u2013 who left after the \u00a3290m Libor fine \u2013 would not reduce the regulator's scrutiny of the bank. The FSA has accused Barclays of having a \"culture of gaming \u2013 and gaming us\". Walker will be the first witness at the new parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by MP Andrew Tyrie and set up in the wake of the Libor scandal. He will appear next Wednesday as part of an inquiry which will reopen the debate about bankers' behaviour before, during and after the 2008 banking crisis. Walker has been called because of his report into banking for the Labour government \u2013 his recommendation that pay of more than \u00a31m should be disclosed was not adopted by the coalition \u2013 rather than in his new position as incoming chairman of Barclays. But Walker, 72, has the task of repairing the reputation of Barclays, and arguably that of the industry, when he moves into the chairman's office in November. With the industry now braced for fresh scrutiny by the Tyrie committee, Horta-Os\u00f3rio said that a new tone needed to \"come from the top\", from \"leaders with the highest integrity and values, who think and act for the long term\". He conceded that bonuses had been focused on sales targets in the past. \"This has had a detrimental impact on behaviour, in part contributing to the problems the industry has experienced with mis-selling, in the case of retail banking. This is an unsustainable model. It's as simple as that. Banks cannot continue to write profits today that we have to pay back at a later date,\" Horta-Os\u00f3rio said. After joining from Santander, he broke ranks with rivals over the PPI mis-selling scandal by agreeing to settle claims while other banks were still fighting the FSA in the courts. In the last 18 months the issue has cost Lloyds \u00a33.3bn and the industry more than \u00a38bn in total. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said there now needed to be a \"customer-centric culture\", adding: \"We must also break with the culture of the past and work with our regulators to ensure the right outcomes for our customers. It cannot be in anyone's interest to enter into the long legal disputes of the past. Now is the time to move on,\" he said, in reference to PPI. His speech to the CBI Scotland annual dinner was welcomed by John Cridland, the CBI director general, as a \"timely speech\" recognising that \"some banks may have lost sight of their core values\".",

The government in Berlin has mounted minimal resistance to the new ECB policy.</p> <p>The initiative is the third time since the spring of 2010 that the ECB has intervened in this way, first buying up Greek debt in May that year, then mounting an unsuccessful attempt last summer to relieve the pressure on Rome by buying Italian debt.</p> <p>These two previous attempts are viewed as having done little to contain the euro crisis. This time, Draghi said, \"it will actually work.\"</p> <p>The reasons he cited were the strict terms attached to receiving assistance; the decision to forgo the ECB's status as a senior creditor and take equal ranking with other creditors; and because the bond-buying would be restricted to short-term debt.</p> <p>Although he overcame the Bundesbank's resistance, Draghi emphatically argued \u2013 in terms clearly aimed at assuaging German objections \u2013 that the new policy was fully in line with the ECB's fundamental monetary policy remit.</p> <p>He repeatedly stressed that the aim was to \"repair monetary policy transmission channels\". He laid out analysis stressing that inflation risks in the eurozone were low over the next two years, and emphasised the tough terms that would need to be observed to qualify for the aid. All ECB bond-buying will be \"sterilised\" \u2013 that is, offset by removing equivalent liquidity from other parts of the euro system \u2013 to counter inflationary risks.</p> <p>Spain is the strongest candidate for becoming the first beneficiary of the new programme. But following talks in Madrid on Thursday with Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy avoided all talk of whether Spain would request a bailout.</p>",

Spanish and Italian 10-year borrowing costs fell to three- and five-month lows following Draghi's announcements. \"A necessary condition for outright monetary transactions is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European financial stability facility/European stability mechanism [bailout],\" Draghi said. \"Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme, provided that they include the possibility of EFSF/ESM primary market purchases,\" he announced. \"There is no ex ante quantitative limit to the interventions.\" Draghi said that the interventions could be halted if they were seen to have been successful in curbing the cost of borrowing, and also suspended if the country benefiting from the help breached the terms on which it received it. The ECB is understood to take the view that the new policy can be up and running very quickly \u2013 in days, rather than weeks or months \u2013 and hopes that the pledge to intervene in the bond markets will by itself have a stabilising effect, curbing borrowing costs for Spain and Italy and acting as a deterrent, meaning that market interventions may not even be needed. If this does not happen, however, and the markets step up the pressure on Madrid or Rome, the country concerned would need to make the first move in requesting a rescue before the ECB will act. More broadly, the Frankfurt-based central bank is also making explicitly political demands of eurozone government leaders, urging them to streamline and integrate the institutional architecture linking the 17 countries, meaning greater pooling of sovereignty and surrender of national powers in fiscal and budgetary policy. The ECB believes it is entitled to demand this as part of its remit to secure the future of the euro. The Bundesbank has argued that a bond-buying programme would be tantamount to direct financing of governments, which is proscribed by the ECB's statutes. But while Germany's central banker, Jens Weidmann, has been a vocal monetarist hawk in the contentious debate leading to Thursday's move, the other German in the ECB governing council, J\u00f6rg Asmussen, played a key role in drafting the new policy. The government in Berlin has mounted minimal resistance to the new ECB policy. The initiative is the third time since the spring of 2010 that the ECB has intervened in this way, first buying up Greek debt in May that year, then mounting an unsuccessful attempt last summer to relieve the pressure on Rome by buying Italian debt. These two previous attempts are viewed as having done little to contain the euro crisis. This time, Draghi said, \"it will actually work.\" The reasons he cited were the strict terms attached to receiving assistance; the decision to forgo the ECB's status as a senior creditor and take equal ranking with other creditors; and because the bond-buying would be restricted to short-term debt. Although he overcame the Bundesbank's resistance, Draghi emphatically argued \u2013 in terms clearly aimed at assuaging German objections \u2013 that the new policy was fully in line with the ECB's fundamental monetary policy remit. He repeatedly stressed that the aim was to \"repair monetary policy transmission channels\". He laid out analysis stressing that inflation risks in the eurozone were low over the next two years, and emphasised the tough terms that would need to be observed to qualify for the aid. All ECB bond-buying will be \"sterilised\" \u2013 that is, offset by removing equivalent liquidity from other parts of the euro system \u2013 to counter inflationary risks. Spain is the strongest candidate for becoming the first beneficiary of the new programme. But following talks in Madrid on Thursday with Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy avoided all talk of whether Spain would request a bailout.",

Draghi secured agreement for the scheme, known as \"outright monetary transactions\" (OMT), against fierce objections from the Bundesbank, in a rare defeat for Germany in eurozone policymaking. The Bundesbank issued a statement condemning the proposal as \"tantamount to financing governments by printing banknotes\".

The FTSE 100 jumped by more than 2% and the S&amp;P 500 in the US rose 2% to its highest level since May 2008.

      "bodyText": "A leading thinktank has forecast that Britain will remain mired in recession this year, and slashed growth forecasts for almost all members of the G7 group of leading industrial nations. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the outlook for the UK had deteriorated and predicted the economy will shrink by 0.7% this year, compared with previous forecasts of 0.5% growth. The only G7 member worse off than Britain is Italy, which is expected to shrink by 2.4%. By contrast, Germany is expected to grow by 0.8%. Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the treasury, said: \"These very concerning forecasts show just how badly the government's economic policies have failed. Britain's growth forecasts have been slashed by more than any other major economy. And while ministers desperately try to blame all our problems on the eurozone crisis, the OECD says France and Germany are doing better than us. In fact Britain is one of just two G20 countries in a double-dip recession.\" The US economy, meanwhile, is expected to grow, helped by improvements in the housing market and some progress on tackling its debt. Still, the OECD cut its growth forecast from 2.4% to 2.3%. Only Japan is thought to be improving, with growth predicted to reach 2.2% (compared with previous expectations of 2%) as it rebuilds its economy following the earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The thinktank blamed the weakening economic outlook squarely on the crisis in the eurozone, which has hit trade and business confidence around the world. The OECD also warned against too much austerity, which it said was \"acting as a drag\". It expects the slowdown in the leading industrial countries to continue to the end of the year and warned that any intensification of the eurozone crisis, a rising oil price, or slowdown in the US \"could derail an already weak recovery\". Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \"The downgrade to the outlook is not surprising, given the deterioration in the eurozone crisis and the extent to which we have seen business confidence hit as a result. Unless the eurozone crisis is resolved soon, even these downgraded forecasts could prove overly optimistic.\" The OECD welcomedThursday's moves by the European Central Bank to intervene in the debt markets and help bring down the borrowing costs of crisis-hit eurozone countries. But it urged central banks across the globe to do more to boost growth \u2013 cutting interest rates to zero and doing more electronic money creation. However, this advice was ignored by the Bank of England, which on Thursday kept rates on hold and made no change to its \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme. The ECB also ignored OECD calls for it to cut its marginal lending facility \u2013 effectively the rate at which commercial banks borrow overnight \u2013 and kept all interest rates on hold. In relation to the US, the OECD said the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" \u2013 when Bush-era tax breaks will be dropped and a series of draconian spending cuts imposed at the end of this year \u2013 would probably push the US economy into recession. It said: \"It is urgent that the political parties agree on detailed medium-term consolidation plans that will avoid this outcome and reduce uncertainty regarding the fiscal outlook.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 7 September 2012 to correct the OECD's previous forecast for the UK from 0.5% decline to 0.5% growth",

After scandal and near-collapse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the insurance market these days does roughly what it is supposed to: meet big insurance liabilities as they fall due without toppling over. They still pay themselves handsomely at Lloyd's \u2013 there was a kerfuffle earlier this year when bonuses for top executives rose in a loss-making year caused by a series of natural disasters \u2013 but we're not talking mega banking bucks. It was interesting therefore to hear John Nelson \u2013 a long-time investment banker but now the new-ish chairman of Lloyd's \u2013 give a frank assessment of how much change is still required in the financial services industry. At Lloyd's annual City dinner on Wednesday evening, he called for the culture to be fixed \"fundamentally and honestly\", implying that the penny has still to drop for many. \"What we've heard a lot of in the last few years are pretty unconvincing claims in public that banks, for example, have cleaned up their act while in private they seemed to be waiting for the storm to blow over and return to 'business as usual',\" he said. \"Well, I don't think it is going to blow over.\" And this: \"The boom in credit and consumerism which fuelled growth from the Big Bang to 2007 is over. We have to find a new model. Any board which is not able to get this, will, in my opinion, be in trouble, both reputationally and commercially.\" Many bankers in the boom time \"believed their own spin\" that they were \"economic heroes\", continued Nelson. And \"the problem has been that they have recently been receiving the sort of financial rewards which rightly belong to the capital providers themselves.\" OK, the rhetoric is a long way from being a call to arms. But, from a senior City establishment figure, it is vastly more impressive than the common knee-jerk refrain that lessons have been absorbed and that the outside world just needs to be patient.",

After scandal and near-collapse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the insurance market these days does roughly what it is supposed to: meet big insurance liabilities as they fall due without toppling over.</p> <p>They still pay themselves handsomely at Lloyd's \u2013 there was a kerfuffle earlier this year when bonuses for top executives rose in a loss-making year caused by a series of natural disasters \u2013 but we're not talking mega banking bucks.</p> <p>It was interesting therefore to hear John Nelson \u2013 a long-time investment banker but now the new-ish chairman of Lloyd's \u2013 give a frank assessment of how much change is still required in the financial services industry. At Lloyd's annual City dinner on Wednesday evening, he called for the culture to be fixed \"fundamentally and honestly\", implying that the penny has still to drop for many.</p> <p>\"What we've heard a lot of in the last few years are pretty unconvincing claims in public that banks, for example, have cleaned up their act while in private they seemed to be waiting for the storm to blow over and return to 'business as usual',\" he said. \"Well, I don't think it is going to blow over.\"</p> <p>And this: \"The boom in credit and consumerism which fuelled growth from the Big Bang to 2007 is over. We have to find a new model. Any board which is not able to get this, will, in my opinion, be in trouble, both reputationally and commercially.\"</p> <p>Many bankers in the boom time \"believed their own spin\" that they were \"economic heroes\", continued Nelson. And \"the problem has been that they have recently been receiving the sort of financial rewards which rightly belong to the capital providers themselves.\"</p> <p>OK, the rhetoric is a long way from being a call to arms. But, from a senior City establishment figure, it is vastly more impressive than the common knee-jerk refrain that lessons have been absorbed and that the outside world just needs to be patient.</p>",

      "bodyText": "European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is expected to announce the details of a bond-buying programme to help keep down borrowing costs of crisis-hit countries later on Thursday. Leaks suggest it will involve unlimited purchases of government debt that will be \"sterilised\" to assuage concerns about printing money. The bond-buying scheme is rumoured to be called the \"outright monetary transactions\", with a shorthand title of OMT. Maturity The life of a bond, at the end of which it will be repaid in full. A bond's maturity can be as short as a year to as long as 100 years. Seniority This refers to how likely you are to be repaid if a bond issuer goes bankrupt. Bondholders with seniority over others will be paid back before other bondholders. There was some concern that the ECB would demand seniority over other bondholders when it undertook the bond-buying scheme, but leaks now suggest otherwise. Unanimity Was the ECB governing council united in backing Thursday's decision, or was there opposition? Bundesbank head Jens Weidmann has spoken out against a bond-buying programme before \u2013 is he now onside? Was the ECB split over interest rate levels, or were the decisions unanimous? Draghi's answer to these questions (which will surely come up) could be crucial. Pari passu A Latin phrase meaning \"equal footing\". In the bond markets, this means bondholders will be treated the same if a bond issuer goes bankrupt. Any purchases the ECB makes as part of its bond-buying programme are expected to be pari passu with other bondholders. Collateral requirements The ECB asks banks for collateral in return for taking out cheap loans. If they relax collateral requirements, they can accept a wider range of assets as collateral from banks. They have already relaxed these requirements, and can now accept everything from bundles of car loans to mortgage-backed securities. Conditionality This is the way the ECB would keep the Germans happy, by imposing conditions on receiving assistance from the ECB; so, if the ECB helps keep a country's borrowing costs low by buying up its bonds, that country may have to agree to some strict austerity. Without conditionality it would be easier for the ECB to unilaterally intervene. Convertibility risk This refers to the risk that you will buy bonds denominated in euros but could ultimately be paid back in lire or drachma (or deutschmarks) if the country taking out the debt leaves the eurozone before the end of the bond's life. Unlimited intervention Exactly what it says on the tin. Expectations are that the ECB will not put a limit on its bond buying. This is seen to be an improvement on the previous bond-buying programme, which was limited in size and therefore lacked credibility in the markets. If other traders do not believe the ECB has the firepower (or inclination) to buy enough bonds to bring down yields, they may continue to bet on them rising. Sterilisation This makes sure the money supply does not increase as a result of the bond-buying programme. When the ECB buys bonds, it is injecting liquidity into the financial system, effectively creating new money. To counteract that, the ECB has in the past followed bond purchases by subsequently draining an equal amount of liquidity from the system. It does this at the weekly deposit tender by increasing the rates it will pay commercial banks to deposit money with the ECB. The idea is that this will encourage banks to deposit more money with the ECB, thereby taking it out of the system. Yield cap Rumour had it that the ECB would set a yield cap on certain countries' government bonds. This would mean if the yield looked like it would break through that level, the ECB would start buying bonds to push prices higher and bring yields back down.",

      "bodyText": "The European commission upped the ante in a potential trade war with China on Thursday, announcing an investigation into allegedly unfair exports of solar panels worth more than \u20ac20bn (\u00a315.85bn) a year. Leading European solar panel manufacturers complained in July that China was demolishing competition by exporting the panels at a loss. \"In terms of import value affected, this is the most significant anti-dumping complaint the European commission has received so far,\" the commission said. Last year China, which accounts for two thirds of global production, exported solar panels worth \u20ac21bn to the EU, some 80% of exported panels. The market is huge. In the span of a few years, China has become the world's biggest solar panels producer, while the EU is by far the biggest market for the Chinese products. The probe threatens to be extremely contentious and highly sensitive politically. The German government, enjoying a trade and exports-based \"special relationship\" with China, is wary of incurring Beijing's wrath, although the complaint has been spearheaded by German firms. On a recent visit to Beijing, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, sought to defuse the escalating dispute, arguing that dialogue and not an EC investigation was the best way to deal with the issue. Beijing's official English-language newspaper, China Daily, warned on Wednesday that Beijing would retaliate with trade curbs on the EU if Brussels went ahead with the investigation. Beijing has also been lobbying hard in Brussels behind the scenes against the probe. \"EU Pro Sun, an industry association, claimed in its complaint lodged on 25 July 2012 that solar panels and their key components imported from China enter the European market at prices below market value,\" the commission said. \"The commission is legally obliged to open an anti-dumping investigation if it receives a valid complaint from a Union industry which provides evidence that exporting producers from one or more countries are dumping a particular product into the EU and causing injury to the Union industry.\" The US authorities have already slapped tariffs on Chinese solar panel exports. The complaint lodged with Brussels came from a consortium of some 20 European producers responsible for a quarter of EU manufacture of panels. The commission said it would deliver a provisional verdict on the dispute by June next year and could then impose temporary tariffs on the Chinese. EU governments would then need to decide how to proceed by the end of next year. China's commerce ministry website responded promptly to the commission move, stating: \"Restricting China's solar panel products will not only hurt the interests of both Chinese and European industry, it will also wreck the healthy development of the global solar and clean energy sector.\" The statement voiced \"deep regret\" at Brussels' action and said the EU should \"seriously consider China's position and proposals, and resolve friction over solar panel trade through consultations and cooperation.\"",
