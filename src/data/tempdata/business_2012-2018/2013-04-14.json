      "bodyText": "The housing market will finally return to life this year with more than a million people expected to move home \u2013 the highest number since the financial crisis struck. The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, which uses the Treasury's economic models, predicted that housing transactions this year will rise by 7.5% to 1m. In its spring forecast the respected economic forecaster said the chancellor's plan to use \u00a312bn of taxpayer funds to underwrite up to \u00a3130bn of mortgages will push home moves up a further 7.8% next year to 1.08m. House moves are also expected to be encouraged by falling mortgage costs due to the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme. Property prices are not expected to rise this year, but are predicted to increase 2.1% in 2014 and 5% in 2015. Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the Item Club, said: \"With export markets continuing to disappoint, the chancellor has focused his firepower on the home front. And the timing couldn't have been better. Real incomes are already starting to recover, mortgages are becoming more readily available, and homes are more affordable as the house price to earnings ratio continues to fall. \"Although it's not a long-term strategy, stimulating the housing market and the high street will keep GDP growth positive. Unbalanced growth is better than no growth.\" Spencer said the chancellor's Help to Buy scheme had the potential to get people moving again, and dismissed claims that it would just put up prices rather than increase supply and make it even more difficult for first-time buyers to get on the ladder. \"We expect [the scheme] to boost the number of housing transactions, particularly at the lower end of the market where the deposit and low equity have been a major constraint,\" he said. However, the Item Club had a gloomier view of the prospects for the economy as a whole, predicting that the UK will have to wait until 2015 before exports start contributing to growth. It expects GDP to expand by just 0.6% this year and said that with the rebalancing of the economy on hold, the UK will again have to rely on the consumer. \"We should start to feel slightly better off this year, which will help to loosen the purse strings. Consumer spending added 0.7 percentage points to GDP in 2012 and the chancellor's budget will help ensure the tills continue to ring for some time yet,\" Spencer said. Consumer spending is set to increase by 1.2% this year and 1.9% in 2014, but the 2.2% growth predicted in the following two years is still well down on the 3.7% a year it averaged in the decade prior to the financial crisis. Spencer added: \"Consumers have been burnt by the experience of the recession and are much more cautious with their finances. Households are likely to continue paying down debt rather than racking up huge credit card bills.\" The bitter March weather dragged high-street footfall down 5.2% last month, according to the British Retail Consortium. It was the weakest month since April 2012. Helen Dickinson, the consortium's director general, said: \"The prolonged cold was the main culprit for deterring shoppers, especially compared against the far milder March of 2012. Although footfall did pick up around the Easter weekend, it couldn't fully compensate for a weak showing across the month as a whole.\"",

The damning assessment of the UK system from one of the world's biggest energy companies comes six months after the Guardian triggered an investigation by City and energy watchdogs with a report detailing concerns about wholesale gas market rigging raised by an ICIS Heren price reporter, Seth Freedman. The inquiries into the \u00a3300bn market, started by the then Financial Services Authority and Ofgem, are still looking at the way the price reporting agencies such as ICIS cover the markets as well as how energy companies go about their wholesale trading activities. Huge gyrations in reported prices on 28 September last year raised fears that it could represent market manipulation similar to Libor interest-rate rigging, a scandal that has undermined financial markets and led to fines of \u00a3290m for Barclays and \u00a3390m for Royal Bank of Scotland. The prices reported by agencies such as ICIS form the basis for long-term contracts and one explanation for the 28 September price movements is that traders stood to benefit by manipulating the benchmark price.

      "bodyText": "Britain is a deeply divided country. Inner London is the richest part of the entire European Union, while Cornwall and Wales benefit from the regional aid dispensed by Brussels. There is full employment in the better-off towns and cities of the home counties, while in Knowsley on Merseyside the true level of joblessness is well over 15%. The electoral map of Britain at the 2010 election captures this divide. There is little Conservative presence in the big conurbations outside London but only a sprinkling of Labour seats in the south-east, the south-west and East Anglia. This regional split, which has grown over time, is crucial in understanding the mixed feelings generated by the death of Margaret Thatcher. That she was revered and loathed in equal measure goes without saying. That these opinions are often rooted in a well-founded economic rationale is less commonly accepted. Let's start with Britain as it was when Thatcher became prime minister in 1979.

      "bodyText": "Tesco's boss, Philip Clarke, will lay out plans to revive the supermarket's largest stores on Wednesday when he reveals the first fall in profits for 20 years. The retailer is expected to report that underlying sales growth has slowed since Christmas despite investing \u00a31bn to boost Tesco's fortunes in the UK since a shock profits warning a year ago. Cutting prices and hiring more store staff has so far failed to offset the impact of the horsemeat scandal, together with tough competition from discount stores such as Aldi and ongoing difficulties with Tesco's non-food ranges. \"Either it is solving the wrong problem or trying to solve it in the wrong way,\" said Dave McCarthy, a food retail analyst at Investec. \"In reality, Tesco's problems are multidimensional.\" While Tesco tries to improve service and reassure shoppers after finding horsemeat in some of its products, it is also experiencing difficult trading conditions overseas.

Tesco has recently announced a buy-out of the family restaurant chain Giraffe and also holds stakes in Harris + Hoole coffee shops and Euphorium bakeries. Clarke is expected to outline how these businesses will help add pizzazz to stores covering more than 6,300 sq metres (60,000 sq ft). A year ago Clarke said Tesco would put the brakes on opening such large stores in the UK as shoppers increasingly choose to buy closer to home rather than pay for the petrol to drive to hypermarkets. On Wednesday, Clarke is expected to announce similar plans in eastern Europe and other foreign markets where Tesco will put more effort into building online sales and opening small local stores. Profits in markets such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic have fallen back amid the Europe-wide economic difficulties. Tesco's sales are also thought to have taken a battering in South Korea after the government brought in new restrictions on trading hours. Meanwhile, the retailer is turning to independent shopkeepers to help drive its expansion by offering franchise deals on its One Stop chain. One franchise outlet has been operating for a few weeks and the group is aiming to sign up a handful of new partners to test the concept over the next six months. One Stop's chief executive, Tony Reed, said: \"We and our customers want to see neighbourhood convenience shops thrive. Our franchising concept is about helping good independent family businesses make an even greater success of their stores.\" Many independent convenience stores operate under so-called symbol groups such as Londis, Spar and Budgens, giving them better deals on stock as well as help and advice on marketing.
