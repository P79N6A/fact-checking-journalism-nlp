In some cases their purchase from Autonomy was cancelled, and at least one reseller received fees from Lynch's company in compensation. On 30 September 2009, the last day of a financial quarter, a reseller called Capax placed a $4m order with Autonomy for software it intended to sell to Kraft, which owns the chocolate maker Cadbury. Capax made a $400,000 downpayment on the deal. But in the following quarter Kraft arranged to buy the software directly from Autonomy. Autonomy subsequently cancelled its sale to Capax, and paid it a $400,000 one-off feein compensation.

      "bodyText": "False teeth, hip joints and replacement knees \u2013 and potentially printable skin and organs \u2013 will drive growth in the burgeoning market for 3D printers over the next decade, according to new research. A report suggests that dentistry and medicine will increasingly harness one of the 21st century's most exciting technological breakthroughs. The technology is better known to British households for its ability to replace broken crockery or produce awkward figurine \"selfies.\" But a report by Cambridge-based market research firm IDTechEx says ceramic jaw or teeth implants and metal hip replacements will become increasingly common 3D fare. The parts are created by nozzles laying down fine sedimentary layers of material that build a product indistinguishable from an item that has rolled off a factory conveyor belt. The dental and medical market for 3D printers is expected to expand by 365% to $867m (\u00a3523m) by 2025, according to IDTechEx analysts, even before bio-printing technology is taken into account. If bio-printing becomes suitable for commercial use \u2013 which scientists hope will allow the printing of pieces of skin, liver or kidney using live cells \u2013 analysts estimate the medical market could reach a value of $6bn or more within 10 years. While printing of complete organs for transplants may be decades away, the use of pieces of tissue for laboratory toxicology tests for cosmetics or drugs could be ready within five years, helping the medical market for 3D printers overtake all other sectors. Dr Jon Harrop, a director of IDTechEx, said: \"Bio printing is a bit unsure as it doesn't exist commercially at the moment but all the medical professionals we interviewed thought it was highly likely to be commercial within 10 years.\" In the US, dental labs have invested in technology that can scan a patient's teeth so new teeth can be produced by pressing the print button. Harrop said there are a number of stumbling blocks in the way of the commercial application of bio printing, but even in the past year, scientists have been able to extend the life of a piece of skin tissue created in the lab from just a few hours to 40 days, taking it closer to the three months required for toxicology tests. At present, 3D printers are most widely used in the automotive industry where they help produce prototypes for new cars or car parts. The next biggest market is aerospace, where manufacturers are using the technology to make lighter versions of complex parts for aeroplanes. Already, 3D printers have been used by the medical industry to create a jaw, a pelvis and several customised hip replacements from metal.

If bio-printing becomes suitable for commercial use \u2013 which scientists hope will allow the printing of pieces of skin, liver or kidney using live cells \u2013 analysts estimate the medical market could reach a value of $6bn or more within 10 years.</p> <p>While printing of complete organs for transplants may be decades away, the use of pieces of tissue for laboratory toxicology tests for cosmetics or drugs could be ready within five years, helping the medical market for 3D printers overtake all other sectors.</p> <p>Dr Jon Harrop, a director of IDTechEx, said: \"Bio printing is a bit unsure as it doesn't exist commercially at the moment but all the medical professionals we interviewed thought it was highly likely to be commercial within 10 years.\"</p> <p>In the US, dental labs have invested in technology that can scan a patient's teeth so new teeth can be produced by pressing the print button.</p> <p>Harrop said there are a number of stumbling blocks in the way of the commercial application of bio printing, but even in the past year, scientists have been able to extend the life of a piece of skin tissue created in the lab from just a few hours to 40 days, taking it closer to the three months required for toxicology tests.</p> <p>At present, 3D printers are most widely used in the automotive industry where they help produce prototypes for new cars or car parts. The next biggest market is aerospace, where manufacturers are using the technology to make lighter versions of complex parts for aeroplanes.</p> <p>Already, 3D printers have been used by the medical industry to create a jaw, a pelvis and several customised hip replacements from metal.

      "bodyText": "The moment of clarity for cyclist Emily Brooke was less like an apple falling on her head and more like the prospect of a white van slamming into her. Like many bicycle users before her, she realised that if the vehicle beside her on the road turned left, she would be squashed as she was in the driver's blind spot. \"I thought that if I was just 5 metres ahead, I would be safe \u2013 I wished I had a virtual me just 5 metres ahead, if I could just project myself there,\" the 28-year-old said. About three years later, the designer has sold more than 3,000 Laserlight units from her company Blaze. Aimed at nighttime cyclists \u2013 50% of urban bicycle commuting is during the evening or night \u2013 the aluminium device combines a light and a laser which projects a green image of a bike onto the ground 5 metres in front of the cyclist. It attempts to make drivers, who may not see the bike in their blind spot, aware of their presence, especially at night. It also alerts pedestrians about to cross the road. Brooke got the idea while studying product design in her final year at the University of Brighton and looking at what the challenges were for urban cyclists. \"There is one statistic which stuck in my mind and that is that 79% of bikes that are hit are going straight ahead and a vehicle turns into them,\" she said. Another common collision, dubbed a Smidsy for \"sorry mate I didn't see you\", is when a driver comes out of a junction. Brooke wanted to tackle what she saw as being the biggest challenge for city cyclists. After dismissing other ideas, like creating a full hologram of herself, came upon the idea of projecting an image on to the ground to alert drivers. Having left university, she created a prototype and was among the first tranche of companies to get the benefit of the wave of publicity that came with the advent of Kickstarter, gathering \u00a325,000 in investment in five days and proving there was demand for the product. \"Naysayers are people who have not seen it. I completely agree with them, it sounds completely wacky. But when you see it in practice, it is a passive green bike, passively travelling on the road in front of you,\" she said. \"It is the symbol of a bike clearly attached to a moving object moving along the ground in one direction, you see it and you orientate to 'where is the bike'. If it doesn't make sense when you first see it, you see it once [more] and then it makes sense.\" Laserlights were shipped to preorders in January this year. Priced at \u00a3125, the light comes with a bracket to attach it to handlebars, is waterproof and the internally sealed battery is charged via a USB cable. The laser, assembled in Shenzhen in China, can only be used when attached to the bike. Both laser and light can be used at the same time, either flashing or in a constant beam. The green light is visible during the day but not effective, says Brooke, and is really aimed for night use when \"you can't miss it\". The bicycle symbol - instead of branding or writing - was chosen to ensure it was universally recognised. Although her first use of the new device resulted in protests from a van driver, she claims reactions from drivers have been positive since and rejects suggestions that the device may be seen as a gimmick or unnecessary. \"This started from a problem first. It started from six months of a problem before I even had an idea. I looked at tracking devices \u2013 a light that lights up the rider, that you have a head torch in your face \u2013 all sorts of concepts, but it was six months of understanding the problem before I came to the solution,\" she said. The relatively high price is as a result of the quality of the parts used, she says. The company has just completed preorders and will now sell Laserlights through Evans Cycles shops in the UK as well as through its own website. Demand from the US \u2013 especially in cities such as San Francisco, New York, Seattle and Chicago \u2013 now accounts for half of sales, surpassing the UK. Purchases from renowned cycle-friendly cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam have highlighted different concerns for cyclists, said Brooke. \"For us it is personal safety and large vehicles. For them it is pedestrians stepping out in front of a bike and the Laserlight tackles that really well. Someone will see that symbol coming before they see me. It is enough for them to go 'Whoa, what is that' and hesitate on the pavement,\" she said. The company has raised \u00a3500,000 in investment so far from, among others, Richard Branson's family and Index Ventures. Another round of investment, for \u00a31m, is being finalised. Blaze now has six employees, including Brooke, and would be in profit but for investment in future products, she says, one of which will be a new type of rear light, expanding on her vision to become the company that caters for the urban cyclist.",

      "bodyText": "In France it was 2006. In Ireland and Spain it was 2003. In Greece it was 2001. In Portugal and Cyprus 2000, in Italy 1997. That's how far back you have to go to find a year when living standards peaked for these countries. Note that the worst performance has not been in a country bailed out since the eurozone debt crisis, but in Italy, now in the final stages of not one but two lost decades. Little wonder, then, that the Italian in charge of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, called for more growth-friendly policies in his speech at the Jackson Hole symposium last Friday. Draghi drew an unfavourable contrast between the eurozone and the US. In both, unemployment rose by five percentage points due to the \"great recession\" of 2008-09; in the US, subsequently, it has fallen by four percentage points but in the eurozone it is still more than four points higher. This year, growth in the US is picking up after a weather-affected winter; in the eurozone activity is at a standstill and deflationary pressures are growing. The speech of Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, was pored over for clues as to when the US central bank might raise interest rates, while observers wanted to know what additional stimulus the ECB could offer. The threats to the eurozone \u2013 or at least the most vulnerable parts of it \u2013 are both economic and social. The economic risk is that prolonged stagnation, coupled with very low inflation or even outright deflation, puts pressure on already stretched public finances. Inflation eases the burden of debt; deflation increases it. For countries like Italy, which already have national debt well in excess of 100% of annual national output, keeping up interest payments could become unsustainable. The social threat is that high unemployment leads to the sort of social unrest seen in Ferguson, Missouri, over the past two weeks. Inequality levels are not as pronounced in Europe as they are in the US but they might become so over time. Double-digit levels of unemployment, stagnation and higher concentrations of wealth are not a recipe for social harmony. What then is to be done? One option is to do nothing apart from sort out Europe's structural problems. Those who favour this approach say that, in part, demographics explain why the eurozone has a slower growth rate than the US: America has a rising population, Europe does not. But Europe also has too many impediments to growth: over-restrictive labour laws, too much bureaucracy, too many protectionist tendencies that prevent the full implementation of the single market. As far as Germany is concerned, austerity has been a useful tool for forcing unwilling governments in southern Europe to embrace structural reform. Berlin would dearly like France to swallow a dose of the same medicine. Draghi's comments at Jackson Hole suggest, though, that the Germans are becoming isolated. Austerity is not lubricating structural reform; rather, as the economist Vicky Pryce has noted, it is turning Europe into a gigantic debtor's prison. The ECB now accepts it would have been better for Europe to have followed the American approach, which seemed to involve getting the economy back on its feet before worrying too much about how much money the Federal Reserve was printing or the size of the budget deficit. This is not an entirely accurate portrayal of events in the US, since ideological differences between the Republicans and Democrats in Congress involved tightening fiscal policy \u2013 raising taxes and cutting spending \u2013 well before the economy recovered. But Draghi is right in his analysis. Europe's economic woes are not just to do with an ageing population; they are also due to fiscal policy being too tight for too long, and to the ECB being slow and, unlike the Fed, Bank of England and Bank of Japan, unwilling to try something different. If history is any guide, Europe will continue to move in baby steps rather than go for a bolder approach. Budget rules will perhaps be relaxed temporarily so that countries can run deficits of more than 3% of gross domestic product without facing the possibility of sanctions. State finances will be jiggled so that money goes to where it is thought good for growth, such as infrastructure spending. The ECB will, once the Germans have been won over, announce a modest quantitative easing programme, buying bonds from the banks in exchange for money in the hope that this will lead to increased flows of credit around the eurozone economy. Will this work? It certainly won't do any harm, but it falls a long way short of being a full answer. Central to Europe's economic malaise is that its banks are in poor shape. They were even more badly run than their British and American counterparts during the years leading up to the crisis, and have been slower subsequently to raise capital and repair their balance sheets. QE has not worked especially well in the US or UK, where the banks are in better shape. The cash the banks have received in exchange for bonds has either been hoarded or recycled through the financial markets to fund purchases of a range of assets. An ECB QE programme would be even less effective given the fragility of the banks. Mark Blyth, economics professor at Brown University, and Eric Lonergan, a London-based hedge-fund manager, have come up with an alternative: print the money but cut out the middlemen and hand the cash straight to the people instead. In the US magazine Foreign Affairs, Blyth and Lonergan write that instead of pursuing policies that ramp up asset prices and make the financial system less stable, central banks should write a cheque to every household \u2013 or, if they wanted to tackle growing inequality, just to the poorest 80% of households. Unlike the banks, consumers, especially the hardest pressed ones, would spend rather than hoard. The ECB, in other words, could learn from the QE programmes in the US and the UK and become the guinea pig for what Milton Friedman called helicopter drops of money. Higher interest rates could be used to counter any inflationary pressure, Blyth and Lonergan say. Germany, clearly, would try to strangle such a plan at birth. For Angela Merkel, it is redolent of the hyperinflation of 1923. But the numbers do not lie. France: 2006. Spain: 2003. Greece: 2001. Italy: 1997. The eurozone is an economic disaster area. Draghi knows that pressure for a different approach is becoming irresistible, which is why he is preparing more unconventional measures. So, say Lonergan and Blyth, why not try something unconventional that might actually work?",
