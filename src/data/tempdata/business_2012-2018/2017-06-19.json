      "bodyText": "The current record low wages growth is something that not only concerns workers \u2013 the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, has also expressed dismay given its impact on household consumption. During a panel session at ANU yesterday, Lowe suggested that there was a real wage \u201ccrisis\u201d. One reason he suggests for the crisis is that workers \u2013 especially those who are underemployed \u2013 may be trapped into thinking a wage rise is a trade-off for less job security. Coming as they did after the rather dismal GDP figures, the May unemployment figures out last week were a nice bit of economic sunshine. In seasonally adjusted terms, Australia\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen from 5.9% in March to 5.5% just two months later: And while the figures are certainly good news, it always pays to be a little bit sceptical. The main reason for the fall in unemployment was the rise of women in full-time employment in New South Wales. In May, the ABS estimates that total employment increased by 42,000, and 92% of that increase was due to 39,000 women in NSW gaining full-time work. That\u2019s pretty impressive given full-time working women in NSW account for just 8% of all people employed in Australia. The 4.1% increase in women in NSW working full-time was the second biggest monthly jump ever recorded in NSW, So as ever we should treat the seasonally adjusted figures with some scepticism, but even the trend figures are looking good \u2013 the annual growth of both employment and hours is now in sync: But with these figures came the rather less happy news that in May there was a record 1.13m people underemployed. Underemployment is a relatively new problem. Back when I was studying economics in the late 1980s and early 1990s it barely rated a mention. The reason was there was so little of it \u2013 over 80% of workers worked full-time and the much bigger problem was unemployment. And while the 1990s recession saw a massive change in the level of full-time employment, even then underemployment did not become a major issue \u2013 as it stayed relatively flat throughout the 1990s: Even when the number of underemployed overtook unemployed in 2004, underemployment still was not a massive issue. The reason was no longer because there was so little of it, but because it largely moved in sync with unemployment. From 2004-2014, through the mining boom, the GFC and the recovery, when the unemployment rate fell or rose, the underemployment rate fell or rose \u2013 the correlation between the two was almost perfect: It was clear if you wanted to reduce underemployment all you needed to do was reduce unemployment. Certainly easier said than done, but it was nice that the two problems could be solved at the same time. And then at the end of 2014 things went bonkers: Had the nice 2004-14 relationship held, with an unemployment rate of 5.7%, underemployment would be around 7.7%. And yet instead it is a record high 8.8%, with 140,000 more people underemployed than we would have expected just three years ago. So much for two problems, one solution. One reason is that part-time employment has grown much faster than full-time employment. And yet not everyone who works part-time wants more hours. Only around 27% of part-time workers consider themselves underemployed \u2013 and that level has not risen since 2014: But obviously if you have more of the labour force working part-time you will also have more of the labour force wanting more hours. In the past decade the percentage of employed people working part-time has risen from 28.3% to 31.9% - equivalent to around 430,000 more people working part-time. Part of the reason is also Western Australia \u2013 which has seen a massive spike in underemployment: And yet while it would be nice to put all the blame on the end of the mining boom out west, even if we excluded WA from the national figures, the underemployment rate would still be a record high of 8.6% and the relationship between unemployment and underemployment over the past three years would still be out of whack: The big concern is that while the underemployed have work, the growing number of those wanting more hours is causing the weak growth in wages, even while the unemployment rate is falling. In terms of the spare capacity in the labour market, reducing unemployment is a much bigger issue. The Reserve Bank recently noted that \u201cunemployed people seek 33 hours of work per week compared with 14 additional hours per week for underemployed people\u201d. This is why in normal times reducing unemployment has the bigger impact on wages growth \u2013 less unemployed leads to a higher growth of wages because it sees a big increase in the total hours of work being done. The recent improvement in the unemployment rate would normally mean wages growth would start to pick up. And yet there is little sign that it has. It would seem that underemployment is now having a greater impact on wages than is unemployment. The RBA suggests that this might be because underemployment might have a different impact on wages. Workers who are after more hours might take them rather than a pay rise. So firms are able to increase hours not through employing new workers \u2013 and having to pay them more to entice them to work for that company \u2013 but by giving more hours to existing workers without needing a pay rise to entice them. Philip Lowe doesn\u2019t want workers to accept that trade off. For if that remains the decision \u2013 more hours versus better wages \u2013 then as underemployment grows so too will the downward pressure on wages growth. And while it is good to hear the head of the RBA argue for greater worker activism for higher wages, in a world where little over 10% of private sector workers are in a union it is hard to see where the impetus for this change is to come. For now it appears that while underemployment grows, it is unlikely to see real wages improve.",

The UK\u2019s largest mutual, which owns supermarkets and funeral homes, has a 20% stake in the bank, which put itself up for sale in February in a search for \u00a3750m of extra funding. But under a proposal being discussed by the bank\u2019s controlling hedge fund shareholders, this stake could drop towards zero unless the group decides to pump millions of pounds into the loss-making bank. In April, the group wrote down the value of its stake to zero, taking a further \u00a3140m hit on its shareholding that had stood at 100% before the problems at the banking arm were uncovered in 2013. Four years ago, hedge funds which owned bonds issued by the Co-op bank helped contribute to its rescue and they are again regarded as the most likely source for the extra capital the bank needs to appease the Bank of England. In an update on the sales process on Monday, the Co-op bank, which has 4 million customers, said it was \u201cin advanced discussions with a group of existing investors with a view to a prospective equity capital raise and liability management exercise\u201d. A liability management exercise would involve bondholders agreeing to convert debt into shares. In a previous update to the market, the bank had warned that it would need to undergo a liability management exercise regardless of whether it was sold, signalling that bondholders faced losses under all the options being considered. In the latest announcement, the Co-op Bank said it was still continuing with talks about a sale of the business. It did not name its suitors \u2013 which at one time were thought to include Virgin Money \u2013 although earlier this month a Qatari conglomerate was said to be interested. Al Faisal Holding, a Qatari conglomerate with interests ranging from hotels to transport, was cited as a bidder for the bank in a deal being coordinated by Interritus, an investment firm that owns a stake in Austrian bank Kommunalkredit. The update also acknowledged the importance of ongoing talks to shore up the \u00a310bn pension fund for both the group and the bank. Sky News has reported that the group wants \u00a3200m to be put into the fund to allow it to be carved up between the two businesses.

      "bodyText": "An economics professor from the London School of Economics who warned against Brexit has been appointed to the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate-setting committee. Silvana Tenreyro was one of 280 economists who signed a public letter ahead of the referendum last year stating it would be a \u201cmajor mistake\u201d for Britain to leave the EU. She will replace the US economist Kristin Forbes who leaves the monetary policy committee (MPC) this month. Tenreyro joins at a time of heated debate among policymakers over whether to leave interest rates at their record low to shore up growth as Brexit talks unfold, or to raise them in order to keep a lid on rising inflation. Forbes was one of three members voting for an increase in borrowing costs at this month\u2019s meeting. The other five, including the governor, Mark Carney, voted to leave interest rates at 0.25%. The LSE professor, who has British, Argentine and Italian citizenships, was appointed to the MPC by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as one of four external members who supplement the expertise of those policymakers working at the Bank full-time. Her appointment is for an initial three-year term starting in July. Tenreyro, the only woman on the MPC, will get her first chance to vote on interest rates at the committee\u2019s next meeting in August. In the meantime, investors will be poring over her previous comments on monetary policy to gauge whether she will tend towards a \u201chawkish\u201d stance \u2013 being more likely to push for higher rates to curb inflation \u2013 or err the other way as a so-called \u201cdove\u201d. Martin Beck at the consultancy Oxford Economics said Tenreyro\u2019s appointment meant the MPC\u2019s \u201carch-hawk\u201d had been replaced by an unknown quantity. \u201cProfessor Tenreyro\u2019s academic background does not offer any clues as to what her attitude might be towards the stance of UK monetary policy. However, she does replace someone who has recently been the most hawkish member of the MPC. Ms Forbes used the last three successive committee meetings to vote for a hike in Bank rate,\u201d said Beck. \u201cGiven that it is very much the pattern for newly appointed committee members not to vote against the consensus view, it seems likely that Professor Tenreyro\u2019s appointment will shift the MPC\u2019s balance in a dovish direction, at least in the next meeting.\u201d Tenreyro has a PhD in economics from Harvard University and at the LSE has specialised in macroeconomics and monetary economics, teaching in those subjects since 2004. She also has previous experience in monetary policy setting having worked as an economist at the US Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and served as an external member on the monetary policy committee at the Bank of Mauritius \u2013 attending many of its quarterly meetings via video conference. Carney, who has been under pressure to ensure the Bank has more women in top jobs, welcomed Tenreyro\u2019s appointment. \u201cHer extensive and varied academic experience \u2013 on the monetary transmission mechanism, the dynamics of productivity, trade, housing issues as well as wage dynamics, to name just a few \u2013 will be invaluable to the committee as it seeks to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom through maintaining monetary stability,\u201d Carney said in a statement. Hammond commented: \u201cI am confident that Professor Tenreyro will be a strong addition to the MPC, bringing a wealth of economic experience and academic rigour to the committee\u2019s deliberations.\u201d In responses to a survey from the Centre for Macroeconomics after the Brexit vote, Tenreyro she said she felt the causes for the result were \u201cmultiple\u201d. She indicated that some politicians had played on the immigration issue. \u201cImmigration certainly played a role in the exit vote, and many voters (partly encouraged by misleading politicians) thought immigration was to be blamed for their problems, while those problems are more complex and date longer,\u201d she said in the July 2016 comments. \u201cSkill-biased technological progress, globalisation, and the fall of unions have created winners and losers, and the latter have not been compensated for their losses. They saw their standards of living deteriorate since the late 1970s, while at the same time salaries at the top of the distribution rocketed. Inequality is a critical issue in the UK and the west that needs to be addressed. Brexit was mostly an angry vote against the lack of progress of the bottom half.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Britain has a new interest rate policymaker, after the government appointed LSE professor Silvana Tenreyro to the Bank of England. City experts have welcomed appointment of Tenreyro, who studied at Harvard and has Argentinian, Italian and UK citizenship, to the Monetary Policy Committee. She\u2019s been described as a \u2018Brexit critic\u2019, given her concerns over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU and the impact of rising inequality. Here\u2019s what the papers are saying. Economists reckon she\u2019s less likely to vote for an interest rate rise than her predecessor, Kristin Forbes (one of three MPC members who wanted to raise borrowing costs this week). European stock markets are enjoying their best day in two months, after yesterday\u2019s French parliamentary elections proved another triumph for Emmanuel Macron. Paris\u2019s CAC index has lead the way, up 1.2%, with other markets also gaining ground. The euro faded, though, after a small bounce when the results came in last night. Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche (La REM) party, and its centre-right ally Modem, won 350 of the 577 lower house seats between them. This leaves Macron with a clear mandate to reshuffle his cabinet and implement economic reforms, say City experts. Some also predict protests from unions, though. Sterling has remained steady, as UK and EU officials began the Brexit talks in Brussels. The pound is hovering around $1.2765, down just 0.1% today. It\u2019s too early to know whether Britain will \u2018have its cake and eat it\u2019, or end up swallowing humble pie. But we do know that the two sides have had cake for lunch - in what looks like some tongue-in-cheek humour by the EU side. The Brexit talks haven\u2019t caused any alarm in the City, yet. The FTSE 100 has gained 65 points, or almost 1%, in a sweltering session. Chris Beauchamp at IG says: The long-awaited beginning of discussions between the UK and the EU has been greeted with an impressive bounce for both UK and European stocks. The rally today has been broad-based, with European markets seeing a return of buyers after weeks of indecision. An ongoing fall in the euro is certainly helping to make life easier for European stocks, while further sterling weakness is helping to lift the FTSE 100. The summer is supposed to be a tough period for stocks, with gains fleeting in duration, but the solid pickup in risk appetite at the beginning of the week is very encouraging, despite the lightness of the macro and corporate calendars. US tech stocks are also recovering from last week\u2019s selloff, with Amazon hitting a fresh record high. The rally may not be over yet.... That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at the University of Liverpool, tells me that Silvana Tenreyro is a well-respected economist with a deep understanding of monetary policy. He believes Tenreyro could take a dovish approach at the Bank England, if the UK economic picture deteriorates. Professor Milas writes: She has pretty robust knowledge of monetary policy issues and, in fact she has researched on this very area finding that (in the US) monetary policy is more powerful in expansions than in recessions. So, if she believes her work (which I think she does) and to the extent that changes in the policy rate have limited impact in a recession, then central banks will be more likely to need to resort to other (unconventional) monetary policy measures to achieve the desired expansionary effect! Hence, she will turn out a dove if she believes that a slowdown is imminent! In other news... Argentina is planning to issue 100-year bonds to the market. The country\u2019s finance minister has announced the plan over Twitter today: According to Bloomberg, the debt will yield a tasty 8.25% - a much better rate than you\u2019d get from most other government bonds. But investors should tread carefully. Argentina has defaulted several times in the past, most famously during the financial crisis of 2001. Bloomberg has more details. The Financial Times says the government have appointed \u201ca staunch critic of Brexit\u201d to the Bank of England\u2019s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee. [Professor Tenreyno\u2019s] views on Brexit are that it will damage the UK economy and she has said this in public \u2014 in her response to the FT survey and in signing a letter from economists urging a vote to remain in the EU, ahead of the referendum last year. In response to the FT New Year survey she said her pessimism about Brexit had not \u201cmoved much\u201d since the EU referendum. \u201cI think it will have a negative impact on the UK economy and Europe more generally\u201d, she added. She added that a \u201chard\u201d Brexit of leaving the single market and the customs union might substantially reduce immigration. \u201cThe effects on the UK economy will certainly be negative \u2014 many firms will need to rethink and reorganise production as they lose talented workers.\u201d The Independent describes her views on monetary policy as \u2018unconservative\u2019. In July 2015, she said \u201creforming the monetary system to allow negative policy interest rates will equip the [Bank of England] with an additional tool to face potential crises in the future\u201d. She also said that it was \u201cworth experimenting\u201d with an increase in the minimum wage and that this could help stimulate the wider economy. Further, she opposed the plans of the former Chancellor, George Osborne, to run a budget surplus by 2020, saying that this consolidation was \u201ctoo brisk and could hamper a healthy recovery\u201d. Reuters call Tenreyro a \u201ctrade-focused economist\u201d, who will join the Bank at a critical time. She will replace the strongest advocate for a rate hike on the BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, meaning economists will scrutinise her opinions even more closely than usual. Tenreyro\u2019s work has focused on issues including trade and wage growth, both of which are important factors for the BoE\u2019s thinking as Britain prepares to leave the European Union and as pay increases have fallen behind inflation. Technology shares are leading the rally on Wall Street today. Amazon are up 1.44%, as traders continue to applaud its takeover of Whole Foods, while Apple have gained 1.7%. Newsflash: America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average has hit a record high at the start of trading in New York. The Dow gained 70 points to 21,454, up 0.33%. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 are also climbing higher at the open. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Silvana Tenreyro\u2019s CV is most impressive. Seven pages long, it includes more than twenty positions (not including her current job at the LSE), a dozen honours, grants and awards, and 17 published papers. Veteran City economist George Magnus is also a fan: Harvard economics professor Robert Barro has told Reuters that Silvana Tenreyro is a \u2018great appointment\u2019 to the Bank of England. Barro supervised Tenreyro when she was studying for her PhD (which she got in 2002), and says she is very knowledgeable about \u2018economic fluctuations\u2019, and the role that monetary policy can play: Ben Chu of the Independent has spotted that professor Tenreyro was critical of the UK government\u2019s austerity programme..... ...and in favour of negative interest rates being imposed in a crisis: Some more snap analysis from the FT\u2019s Chris Giles (based on her answers to the CFM\u2019s surveys) Silvana Tenreyro has argued that Britain needs a new industrial policy to help it cope with Brexit. That\u2019s according to a regular survey by the Centre For Macroeconomics, who poll a range of economic experts. In February, Tenreyro said: Brexit will change many aspects of the UK economy. There is still uncertainty about the scope and consequences that Brexit will have on the economy. (Let us not forget that Brexit has not happened yet!). I think the UK needs to think about industrial policy among many other policies. It is far from clear, however, that industrial policy will solve the problems the economy will likely face or that it will be enough to boost long term growth. The shape industrial policy takes will matter a lot. With industrial policy, the devil is in the details. And last July, she said \u201cmisleading politicians\u201d had encouraged people to vote for Brexit. Asked for the most likely reason that a majority of UK voters went against the near unanimous advice of the economics profession, she replied: Immigration certainly played a role in the exit vote, and many voters (partly encouraged by misleading politicians) thought immigration was to be blamed for their problems, while those problems are more complex and date longer. Skill-biased technological progress, globalization, and the fall of unions have created winners and losers, and the latter have not been compensated for their losses. They saw their standards of living deteriorate since the late 1970s, while at the same time salaries at the top of the distribution rocketed. Inequality is a critical issue in the UK and the West that needs to be addressed. Brexit was mostly an angry vote against the lack of progress of the bottom half. More details here. Andreas Wallstr\u00f6m, chief analyst at Nordea Markets, thinks the Treasury have made an astute hire: Andy Bruce of Reuters flags up that Tenreyro signed a letter in May 2016 warning that Brexit would harm the economy. Chris Giles of the Financial Times points out that she didn\u2019t change her view after the referendum.... Jordan Rochester of Nomura reckons that Tenreyro is less likely to push for an interest rate rise than the outgoing Kristen Forbes, who voted for a rate hike last week. Relative to the hawkish person she is replacing (Forbes) and the view that new members do not usually jump straight into a bias, we would assume a slight swing to a more dovish vote. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, says: \u201cI am delighted to appoint Professor Silvana Tenreyro as the new external member of the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England. I am confident that Professor Tenreyro will be a strong addition to the MPC, bringing a wealth of economic experience and academic rigour to the Committee\u2019s deliberations.\u201d Newsflash: Britain has a new interest rate setter -- London School of Economics professor Silvana Tenreyro. Professor Tenreyro has just been named as the next external member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). She will join the MPC on 1 July, replacing Kristin Forbes whose term expires on 30 June 2017. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, says Tenreyro has important skills in the dynamics of the labour market -- an important issue, given Britain is struggling with weak productivity and falling real wages. Carney says: \u201cI am delighted to welcome Silvana Tenreyro to the Monetary Policy Committee and am very much looking forward to working with her. Her extensive and varied academic experience \u2013 on the monetary transmission mechanism, the dynamics of productivity, trade, housing issues as well as wage dynamics, to name just a few \u2013 will be invaluable to the Committee as it seeks to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom through maintaining monetary stability.\u201d Tenreyro\u2019s CV shows that she has British, Italian and Argentine citizenships. She has a degree from the National University of Tucuman, Argentina, and a PhD from Harvard University. She lists her academic interest as \u201cMacroeconomics, growth, macro-development, monetary economics, international economics\u201d. She has written academic papers on a wide range of issues including the impact of monetary policy, wage dynamics and currency unions (all important issues of the day). Shares in almost every major company listed on the Paris stock market have risen this morning. Thirty six members of the CAC40 index of blue-chip French companies are up, with just four lagging behind. This means the CAC is holding onto this morning\u2019s 1% jump; it\u2019s currently 35 points higher at 4173. Industrial firms are leading the rally, including steelmaker ArcelorMittal and aeroplane maker Airbus. Banks, such as BNP Paribas, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,and Credit Agricole, are also gaining ground. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, gives the credit to Emmanuel Macron: European equity markets are in positive territory this morning as the political success of Emmanuel Macron in France has boosted investor confidence. Mr Macron was tipped to gain a majority and that he did, and traders welcomed the news as political stability in Europe is a welcome change. With his parliamentary majority secured, Emmanuel Macron has flown to the Paris Air show in a military transport jet. The French president landed at the Bourget airfield in an Airbus A400-M military transport plane to launch the aviation showcase. His arrival was followed by a flypast by the world\u2019s largest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, and France\u2019s aerial display team. Reuters suggests that Macron was keen to signal his support for Airbus: The ceremony lent high-level support to two ambitious European aerospace projects tarnished by problems in recent years: the A400M because of chronic cost overruns and delays and the A380 because of weak sales that threaten its future. The Paris Air show is the world\u2019s biggest air show, and a major event for the industry. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains what to expect: Since 1909 it has been held every two years at Le Bourget Airport in north Paris \u2013 where Charles Lindbergh landed after making the first solo, non-stop transatlantic flight in 1927, between New York and Paris. Crowds will be wowed by spectacular flying displays, but in business terms the 52nd air show is likely to be a more subdued affair. Aviation experts say aircraft makers will bag far fewer orders than in previous years, as low oil prices have relieved pressure on airlines to replace older planes. In any case, Airbus and Boeing have been struggling to deliver due to problems with their supply chains. As usual, the two arch rivals will be seeking to outdo each other at the air show. Boeing will reveal the new 737 Max-10, an upgraded version of its bestselling single-aisle 737 plane. The American company is also expected to unveil plans for a new highly efficient medium-sized aircraft. Airbus, for its part, will unveil plans for an enhanced A380, the \u201cA380plus\u201d \u2013 with new large winglets that will save fuel. Airbus and Boeing face new competitors \u2013 China\u2019s Comac C-919 and Russia\u2019s United Aircraft Corporation\u2019s MC-21 \u2013 which will not be at the show. A new arrival at the event is Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which will show off Japan\u2019s first commercial aircraft in 50 years, the MRJ regional jet, which has been beset with delays. In another highlight, Brazil\u2019s Embraer is showing three aircraft \u2013 the military transport plane KC-390, the commercial E195 airliner and the Legacy 450 business jet. But when the event opens to the public at the end of the week, the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet looks to dazzle spectators with its circus acrobatics. Back in Brussels, David Davis and Michel Barnier have shaken hands for the cameras as the Brexit negotiations begin. Both men struck a positive tone before the press, Davis pledged to do everything possible to achieve a deal that works for all citizens, while Barnier said he hopes to agree a timetable for the negotiations today: My colleague Jennifer Rankin has the details: Our Politics Live blog will be tracking all the action: Just in: France\u2019s building sector outperformed the rest of Europe in April. New figures from Eurostat show that French construction output jumped by 3.5% during April, after a 5.3% slump in March. Across the whole eurozone, output rose by just 0.3% month-on-month, with housebuilding activity picking up but civil engineering contracting. Output across the wider European Union was flat month-on-month. Eurostat explains: Among Member States for which data are available, the highest increases in production in construction were recorded in Sweden (+3.8%), France (+3.5%) and the Czech Republic (+1.6%), and the largest decreases in Romania (-7.7%), Italy (-4.1%) and Hungary (-2.6%). The pound is crept back over $1.28 this morning, up 0.25%. Traders are watching events in Brussels, as David Davis and Michel Barnier begin negotiating Brexit. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale doesn\u2019t expect any major developments The UK position is as clear as mud\u2019 beyond growing signs that the UK wants free trade without being part of the customs union or conceding grounds on border controls. Sterling\u2019s probably range-bound. Any rally triggered by \u2018soft Brexit\u2019 hopes is probably temporary. Julien Manceaux, senior France economist at ING, predicts that Macron will kick off his most \u201cunpopular\u201d labour reforms in the first few months of his presidency. That would let him capitalise on his honeymoon with voters; even so, there is still likely to be resistance to cutting workers\u2019 protections and entitlements. As Manceaux puts it: \u201cThe mandate for reform is not extremely strong for Mr Macron who could hence endure strong civil opposition, especially to his labour and pension reforms. (that\u2019s via the FT) Here are the official results from yesterday\u2019s French parliamentary election, showing how Macron\u2019s REM party, and his allies in the Modem party, won a substantial majority. The French stock market has jumped by almost 1% at the start of trading, as Parisian traders applaud Macron\u2019s win. The CAC 40 index has gained 39 points, or 0.95%, to 4177, which is a two-week high. Other markets are also showing healthy gains, on relief that France\u2019s new president won\u2019t face a deadlocked parliament (there had been worries that his new party wouldn\u2019t be able to win a majority). In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 52 points to 7515. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The positive opening comes as traders welcome another Macron victory in France, this time in Parliamentary elections, which give hope to him passing reforms that can help both the French economy and thus Europe, There is also optimism about a positive start to UK-EU Brexit negotiations which kick off today in Brussels. But.... the poor turnout in yesterday\u2019s election is causing some analysts to question whether Macron has really energised France. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services warns: The focus will be on how French President Macron turns words into action after securing a solid parliamentary majority, though not as large as opinion polls had suggested, and with a very poor 43.5% turnout underlining a great deal of scepticism among the general public as a whole. Emmanuel Macron now has a free hand to drive his policies through, say Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s strategists. We reiterate our view that there is no real opposition to the proposed economic reforms left on the political side - with only the street and unions likely to oppose the measures. The scale of En Marche\u2019s victory gives Macron an \u201cincredible\u201d position to push reforms through, says Elliot Hentov, head of policy and research for EMEA at State Street Global Advisors. But there could still be protests on the streets, he adds, against Macron\u2019s plans to make it easier to lay off workers or cut wages. Macron will enjoy one of the largest majorities in French history. A large portion of these new parliamentarians are new to national politics and this reinforces the sense that a wholesale political revolution has taken place. Most importantly, it affirms that Macron will have incredible leeway in pushing his domestic agenda. Markets should therefore expect that labour reforms should pass, as should changes to the tax code and pension system. The impact could be structural and two-fold, both in boosting French investment and productivity gains as well as in setting the stage for more audacious reforms of the Eurozone. Nonetheless, Macron will still face public hostility to his reforms, possibly in the streets but not in parliament, but after yesterday, that will likely be expressed in burning tires rather than parliamentary machinations.\u201d With an absolute majority comes absolute responsibility, says Le Figaro, as it splashes on Macron\u2019s win: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s relief in European financial markets this morning after French president Emmanuel Macron won another landmark victory. The La R\u00e9publique en Marche (La REM) party, and its centrist allies the Democratic Movement (Modem), have secured a large majority in the French parliament, claiming around 350 of the 577 seats up for grabs. This gives Macron the muscle he needs to implement his plans to change French labour law, and overhaul unemployment benefits and pensions. Getting those reforms enacted will be a struggle - as previous French leaders have discovered. Investors, though, will be pleased to see that Macron is now in a position to push through the promises he made during his successful presidential bid this year. That relief has sent all Europe\u2019s main stock markets up in early trading, by around 0.75% (full details to follow). Macron\u2019s government spokesman Christophe Castaner, said the new party (created less than two years ago) now has to deliver: \u201cThe French people have given us a clear majority, but they didn\u2019t want to give us a blank cheque. It\u2019s a responsibility. The real victory will be in five years time when things will have really changed.\u201d \u201cThere is a strong majority, there\u2019s a will for things to change.\u201d However, there are also concerns that the turnout slumped to a record low - showing how many voters are disenchanted with politics. The pound could be skittish today, as the formal talks over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union begin (nearly a year after the historic Brexit referendum). David Davis, UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, will sit down with Michel Barnier, the European Commission\u2019s Chief Negotiator, to lay out their opening positions. Given Britain\u2019s fragile political situation, EU leaders fear that talks will collapse - resulting in a \u201cbrutal Brexit\u201d The Guardian reports this morning that: As officials began gathering in Brussels on Sunday night, the long-awaited start of negotiations was overshadowed by political chaos back in Westminster, where chancellor Philip Hammond warned that failing to strike a deal would be \u201ca very, very bad outcome\u201d. The EU side fears that, in reality, the British government will struggle to maintain any position without falling apart in the coming months, because, without support from the Democratic Unionist party, May\u2019s negotiating hand is limited. There are also concerns that any DUP backing to give May a majority in the House of Commons would come with strings attached. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears that the talks could be tough: Also coming up, a new healthcheck on Europe\u2019s builders and the start of the Paris Air Show. 10am BST: Eurozone construction output for April All day: Paris Air Show, Day 1",

The impact could be structural and two-fold, both in boosting French investment and productivity gains as well as in setting the stage for more audacious reforms of the Eurozone.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Macron will still face public hostility to his reforms, possibly in the streets but not in parliament, but after yesterday, that will likely be expressed in burning tires rather than parliamentary machinations.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594777e9e4b0240ef7615eb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-19T07:12:38.382Z\">8.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With an absolute majority comes absolute responsibility, says Le Figaro, as it splashes on<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jun/19/european-markets-rise-ftse-euro-macron-majority-brexit-talks-business-live?page=with:block-59476e1ee4b014a733d639ca#block-59476e1ee4b014a733d639ca\"> Macron\u2019s win</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/status/876689933603360768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Majorit\u00e9 absolue, responsabilit\u00e9 absolue&quot; - Good line by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Le_Figaro\">@Le_Figaro</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron\">@EmmanuelMacron</a>&#39;s win in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/l%C3%A9gislatives2017?src=hash\">#l\u00e9gislatives2017</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/France?src=hash\">#France</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/k08siQHfDx\">pic.twitter.com/k08siQHfDx</a></p>&mdash; Yannis Koutsomitis (@YanniKouts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/status/876689933603360768\">June 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-19T07:14:04.474Z\">at 8.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59476e1ee4b014a733d639ca\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-19T07:02:43.176Z\">8.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The agenda: Macron wins, as Brexit talks begin</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s relief in European financial markets this morning after French president Emmanuel Macron won another landmark victory.</p> <p><strong>The La R\u00e9publique en Marche (La REM) party, and its centrist allies the Democratic Movement (Modem)</strong>, have secured a large majority in the French parliament, claiming around 350 of the 577 seats up for grabs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pierrebri/status/876692713634230272\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">French Parliament, final results.

      "bodyText": "ITV\u2019s hunt for a chief executive has narrowed to a shortlist that includes a senior Sky executive, the boss of an insurance group and the head of a Scottish broadcaster. Its board is expected to discuss the selection process at a meeting this week that could identify Adam Crozier\u2019s successor, with an official announcement expected in July. The shortlist is led by Andrew Griffith, chief operating officer at Sky, Paul Geddes, chief executive of Direct Line, and Rob Woodward, the outgoing chief executive of STV, which holds the ITV broadcasting licences for northern and central Scotland. Candidates thought to still be in the running also include Simon Pitts, the managing director of ITV\u2019s digital and pay TV strategy. Pitts is also thought to have made it to final interviews for the Channel 4 chief executive role. John Smith, a former chief operating officer at Burberry and ex-chief of BBC Worldwide, is also viewed as a contender. ITV\u2019s nominations committee is understood to be seeking a candidate with solid experience at a major publicly listed company, with headhunters Spencer Stuart looking beyond the media sector and flagging the candidacy of Geddes, who is also a non-executive director at Channel 4. ITV\u2019s chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, has no experience of chairing a listed business. It is thought that some FTSE experience would bolster ITV\u2019s board-level operations. Crozier leaves at the end of the month. Multiple sources have said that the ITV board has been aware of his intentions to leave as far back as October. The process for Channel 4 to appoint a new chief executive took less than three months, with Alex Mahon to take over from David Abraham in October or early November. ITV has put in place an interim measure in which Bazalgette will take the temporary role of executive chairman. Finance director Ian Griffith will run the company as chief operating officer until Crozier\u2019s replacement starts. Griffiths s highly rated by the City but not thought to have applied for the top job. When ITV announced Crozier\u2019s departure at the beginning of May, Bazalgette said the company had a \u201cwell-developed succession plan\u201d in place. The chairman was questioned by investors at ITV\u2019s annual meeting later that month, to which he said: \u201cNothing has gone wrong, we are in a good place.\u201d One top 10 ITV shareholder said that the despite outward appearances the broadcaster had been preparing for Crozier\u2019s departure for a considerable time. \u201cWe have been fully engaged with the board over the last six to none months over succession planning,\u201d said the investor, who did not wish to be named. \u201cWe saw the chairman at the end of last year and don\u2019t have concerns over the process. It is a fully thought out process.\u201d The chief executive of WPP, one of the biggest spenders of advertisers\u2019 money on ITV, said the broadcaster had a tough task choosing its next leader, with the TV advertising market under attack from Facebook and Google and viewers being lured away by the rise of streaming rivals businesses such as Netflix and Amazon. \u201cClearly [ITV] is going to need somebody who has a fundamental understanding of traditional and new, over the top [internet] services, so it is a balance,\u201d Sir Martin Sorrell said. \u201cThey probably need a global understanding as well, as ITV is now a much more international business. It is not an easy position to fill from the point of view that the capabilities you need are very broad. It is a very demanding role. A pretty all embracing job description.\u201d A spokesman for ITV said: \u201cThe board has a well developed succession plan in place and is focused on the process of finding a successor.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a joke, beloved of American economists, that has a chief executive, a member of the conservative Tea Party movement and public-sector employee sitting at a table eyeing a plate of 12 biscuits. The chief exec grabs 11 of them, before turning to the Tea Party member and warning: \u201cYou better watch him. He wants your cookie.\u201d This gag has been doing the rounds for a bit now and tends to be trotted out when the topic of inequality comes up \u2013 which means that there is a fair chance that someone might give it a run out at the Resolution Foundation this week, as the thinktank launches new research into \u201cthe wealth of our nation: who owns what in 21st-century Britain\u201d. The topic feels as current as ever \u2013 especially as the work will examine \u201cnot just at the wealth gap between rich and poor, but also the new gap opening up between young and old\u201d \u2013 and comes at a point when Oxfam reckons the accumulated wealth of Britain\u2019s richest 1% is more than 20 times the total of the poorest fifth. The charity says the inequality problem is likely to have been a contributing factor in the vote to leave the European Union and that the figures make the country one of the most unequal in the developed world. That really takes the biscuit. Worth keeping track of Hornby\u2019s travails In April, a plan by the second-largest shareholder in Hornby to oust the toymaker\u2019s chairman hit the buffers. A 20% shareholder called New Pistoia described Hornby\u2019s five years under Roger Canham as \u201cdisastrous\u201d, before predicting that the firm\u2019s \u201cineffective\u201d strategy \u201cwill continue to destroy value and is not aligned with creating wealth for all shareholders\u201d. Oh \u2013 and just for good measure it added that Canham\u2019s other role, at Hornby\u2019s largest shareholder Phoenix, was not \u201cin accordance with principles of good corporate governance\u201d. Canham was not derailed: but if he\u2019s congratulating himself over holding on to the controls at a company whose brands also include Scalextric, Airfix and Corgi, then he probably shouldn\u2019t. Having your second largest shareholder characterise your tenure as \u201cdisastrous\u201d hardly suggests the chairman has been doing a flawless job \u2013 and nor does the company\u2019s share price. It slumped by 62% in February 2016 after the firm warned of mounting losses following a \u201cdisappointing\u201d start to that year \u2013 and it hasn\u2019t really shown much sign of staging a comeback since. All of which makes the group\u2019s full-year results this week rather intriguing. Developing. Listening bank puts ear to ground It may not currently be the most fashionable tactic for everyone \u2013 but this week we\u2019re going to see what happens when our ruling classes talk to ordinary people. On Wednesday we get the latest instalment of the Bank of England\u2019s agents\u2019 summary of business conditions \u2013 effectively a report from Threadneedle Street\u2019s eyes and ears on the ground around the country. The field agents talk to hundreds of businesses and report back with scores and comments on the health of consumer spending, manufacturing, the housing market, pay awards and costs faced by business and consumers. This is likely to be watched more closely than usual following the split that emerged last week at the Bank over the right time to raise interest rates from their record low of 0.25%. Three members voted against the other five and called for an immediate rise in borrowing costs to keep a lid on inflation. One of the hawks, Kristin Forbes, leaves the monetary policy committee at the end of the month \u2013 but investors will be hoping to hear from the other two, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, soon. They will certainly hear from the governor \u2013 Mark Carney \u2013 this week, as on Tuesday he and chancellor Philip Hammond will be delivering their Mansion House speeches, cancelled last week after the Grenfell Tower fire.",

He wants your cookie.\u201d</p> <p>This gag has been doing the rounds for a bit now and tends to be trotted out when the topic of inequality comes up \u2013 which means that there is a fair chance that someone might give it a run out at the Resolution Foundation this week, as the thinktank launches new research into \u201cthe wealth of our nation: who owns what in 21st-century&#xa0;Britain\u201d.</p> <p>The topic feels as current as ever \u2013 especially as the work will examine \u201cnot just at the wealth gap between rich and poor, but also the new gap opening up between young and old\u201d \u2013 and comes at a point when Oxfam reckons the accumulated wealth of Britain\u2019s richest 1% is more than 20 times the total of the poorest fifth.</p> <p>The charity says the inequality problem is likely to have been a contributing factor in the vote to leave the European Union and that the figures make the country one of the most unequal in the developed world.</p> <p>That really takes the biscuit.</p> <h2>Worth keeping track of Hornby\u2019s travails<br></h2> <p>In April, a plan by the second-largest shareholder in Hornby to oust the toymaker\u2019s chairman hit the buffers.</p> <p>A 20% shareholder called New Pistoia described Hornby\u2019s five years under Roger Canham as \u201cdisastrous\u201d, before predicting that the firm\u2019s \u201cineffective\u201d strategy \u201cwill continue to destroy value and is not aligned with creating wealth for all shareholders\u201d. Oh \u2013 and just for good measure it added that Canham\u2019s other role, at Hornby\u2019s largest shareholder Phoenix, was not \u201cin accordance with principles of good corporate governance\u201d.</p> <p>Canham was not derailed: but if he\u2019s congratulating himself over holding on to the controls at a company whose brands also include Scalextric, Airfix and Corgi, then he probably shouldn\u2019t. Having your second largest shareholder characterise your tenure as \u201cdisastrous\u201d hardly suggests the chairman has been doing a flawless job \u2013 and nor does the company\u2019s share&#xa0;price.</p> <p>It slumped by 62% in February 2016 after the firm warned of mounting losses following a \u201cdisappointing\u201d start to that year \u2013 and it hasn\u2019t really shown much sign of staging a comeback since.</p> <p>All of which makes the group\u2019s full-year results this week rather intriguing.</p> <p>Developing.</p> <h2>Listening bank puts ear to ground<br></h2> <p>It may not currently be the most fashionable tactic for everyone \u2013 but this week we\u2019re going to see what happens when our ruling classes talk to ordinary people.</p> <p>On Wednesday we get the latest instalment of the Bank of England\u2019s agents\u2019 summary of business conditions \u2013 effectively a report from Threadneedle Street\u2019s eyes and ears on the ground around the country.</p> <p>The field agents talk to hundreds of businesses and report back with scores and comments on the health of consumer spending, manufacturing, the housing market, pay awards and costs faced by business and consumers.</p> <p>This is likely to be watched more closely than usual following the split that emerged last week at the Bank over the right time to raise interest rates from their record low of 0.25%.</p> <p>Three members voted against the other five and called for an immediate rise in borrowing costs to keep a lid on inflation. One of the hawks, Kristin Forbes, leaves the monetary policy committee at the end of the month \u2013 but investors will be hoping to hear from the other two, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, soon. They will certainly hear from the governor \u2013 Mark Carney \u2013 this week, as on Tuesday he and chancellor Philip Hammond will be delivering their Mansion House speeches, cancelled last week after the Grenfell Tower fire.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is expected to extend the deadline for making compensation offers to victims of the HBOS Reading fraud, as it emerged only one of 64 affected customers has received compensation. Lloyds had pledged to do so by the end of June. The compensation is to come from \u00a3100m the bank has set aside for the victims of the fraud, which took place between 2003 and 2007 before it bought HBOS at the height of the financial crisis. Six people were jailed in February for the fraud, forcing Lloyds to say it would pay compensation to the individuals. The bank appointed Prof Russel Griggs to act as an independent reviewer. Lloyds would not say how many compensation offers had been made, but it was thought that just one of the 64 had agreed to the terms and received payment from the bank. The fraud victims include TV presenter Noel Edmonds. Edmonds, who seeks \u00a373m for what he claims is the destruction of his Unique business empire, has accused the bank of \u201cfoot dragging\u201d over compensation payouts to victims. His lawyers are maintaining the pressure on the bank, describing the process for claiming compensation as \u201ccharade designed to cause delay and wear down my client\u201d. Jonathan Coad at Keystone Law has received correspondence showing Griggs has hired a \u201cteam of professional advisers\u201d to assist him. They are though to be the accountancy firms RSM, and Mercer &amp; Hole. Griggs said: \u201cThe review is making good progress, and I am pleased with how many customers are coming forward and speaking to us productively. \u201cWe have already made some offers to customers and have started to receive acceptances. We do recognise, however, that some customers may need longer to provide their input and we will give them the time they need.\u201d Coad argued the victims of the fraud were dependent on Lloyds\u2019 assessment of the level of compensation and that they did not have access to experts to assess them. The system was \u201cdesigned to cheat HBOS fraud victims from their legitimate entitlement by way of compensation\u201d, he said. Lloyds insisted that this was not the case. \u201cPart of [Griggs\u2019] role is to agree the individual case outcomes, and to ensure that these outcomes are fair. He will make his decisions independently,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe continue to work at pace with Professor Griggs to ensure appropriate redress is provided to impacted customers. Where customers have already provided information, we remain on track to make compensation offers by the end of June and we are pleased to confirm the first offers have already been made.\u201d The fraud related to the activities of Lynden Scourfield, a former HBOS banker, who was jailed along with his business associate David Mills. Scourfield had pleaded guilty to the scheme, which involved introducing his small business clients to Mills, who was convicted along with his wife, Alison, and their associates Michael Bancroft and Tony Cartwright of running the fraud. Scourfield was bribed by Mills with foreign cruises and sex parties. In return, Scourfield agreed to give inappropriate loans to struggling businesses, which allowed Mills and his associates to profit from imposing high consultancy fees on those firms.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The ne plus ultra of sprouted oat honey hemp granola and mango habanero kale chips is on the west side of downtown Austin \u2013 the location of arguably the world\u2019s finest Whole Foods Market. So it should be: the company was founded in the Texas city and is headquartered above the 80,000-sq-foot flagship store, where a mission statement is fixed to a wall above carts and stacked boxes of Spanish white wine: \u201cNourishing the health and well-being of people and planet by being the authentic purveyor of food for the greater good.\u201d It is a lofty goal, in line with the vision of co-founder and CEO John Mackey, who started his first store, Safer Way, nearby in 1978. Two years later, Mackey and his partners opened the first Whole Foods. The company now has 461 stores in the US, UK and Canada. On Friday the online retailer Amazon agreed to add Whole Foods to its basket in a $13.7bn deal that will marry a supermarket famous for high prices and a do-good ethos with a technology giant known for low-cost items and rapacious ambition. In a Texas Monthly interview, Mackey decried the perception that in America, \u201cbusiness is about a bunch of greedy bastards running around exploiting people, screwing their customers, taking advantage of their employees, dumping their toxic waste in the environment, acting like sociopaths\u201d. Amazon, meanwhile, is experimenting with cashier-less groceries checkout and recently secured a patent for technology that could block customers from using an in-store wifi network to compare prices with a competitor, according to The Washington Post \u2013 which is owned by Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive. The Whole Foods purchase will reportedly see Mackey stay in his role and the company remain headquartered in Austin, but with details scarce about Amazon\u2019s plans, some in the city on Saturday wondered what the deal will herald for the firm, its hometown and the food business in general. \u201cIt might be a great idea since their stock price has recently fallen, but it makes me wonder about the future, long-term, of high-end food,\u201d said Jamie Gage, who was selling produce at a weekly downtown farmer\u2019s market. \u201cIf Amazon buys it, will it all be distilled to some sort of homogeny that kind of cuts off on the fringes all the things that make food great, like all the variety?\u201d Another vendor, who declined to give his name because his company sells products through Amazon, said he had mixed emotions: major corporations can help small retailers find a bigger audience and innovations such as online food ordering have potential. But, he cautioned, it could be \u201cdangerous\u201d for minnows who risk being subsumed and crushed by behemoths if a \u201csweet spot\u201d is not found. A shelf-stocker at the Whole Foods flagship store said he and colleagues were waiting for more information before drawing any conclusions. \u201cAs of now, I\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine \u2013 unless something drastic happens, but we won\u2019t know until it\u2019s approved in a few months.\u201d The shelf-stocker said he hoped the company\u2019s benefits package, generous for the sector, would not be affected. \u201cHere it\u2019s great, I get full benefits and everything,\u201d another worker said, adding that he had heard negative reports about the work environment at an Amazon warehouse but was not worried about potential job losses if Bezos\u2019s drone-loving company pursues a more automated approach. \u201cNo, I\u2019m more just worried about general changes and how the salary works and benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems the CEO\u2019s remaining and all the administration\u2019s remaining so it shouldn\u2019t happen. They\u2019ve already said they\u2019re going to keep the same message and stuff, which is I guess what really matters in the end, because that is the whole point of the store.\u201d \u2018It changed the culture here\u2019 Austin\u2019s progress has mirrored, and is linked to, one of its most important companies: from small, idealistic and provincial to big, moneyed and internationally renowned, with inevitable growing pains. Like Seattle, Amazon\u2019s main base, Austin has boomed and gentrified, a process boosted by the wealth of ambitious technology outfits whose global-minded corporate cultures can seem to chafe with the cities\u2019 cherished quirky, independent characters. When Mackey was starting out four decades ago, the metropolitan area\u2019s population was under 600,000. Now it is over two million. \u201cWhole Foods has blown up,\u201d said Athena Hathaway Meskimen, a 28-year-old selling all-natural popsicles at the farmer\u2019s market. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it get big here.\u201d She also works for a local hibiscus tea company that sells its drinks through Whole Foods. \u201cFrom that perspective I think they\u2019ve done a pretty good job of trying to integrate [small businesses],\u201d she said. Gage, 35, said: \u201cIt changed the culture here and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever go back. I think it promoted early food culture here because now, while there are a lot of fine dining options here in Austin, a lot of emphasis on farm to table, that\u2019s something that didn\u2019t really exist until I would say 1995, here in Austin. I think they were part of the impetus, that and also the influx of people from California, with the high-tech boom in the late 90s.\u201d Dell is headquartered in the region; Google expanded its Austin presence in 2015, the same year Amazon moved into a big corporate space in the city. It currently has nearly 200 open jobs there. Though Whole Foods has hit turbulence as bigger rivals have expanded their organic offerings, Austin at least is expanding its population of young professionals likely to be drawn to the company\u2019s ethos and products, and unlikely to balk at the cost. At the farmer\u2019s market on Saturday, as shoppers browsed cakes, jams, fruit and vegetables in the searing heat, a guitar band strummed mellow tunes that helped mask construction noise from surrounding blocks. The market\u2019s three-dozen little white canopies were dwarfed by cranes and shiny new residential towers. \u201cI think the balance continually adjusts as more and more people come to the city,\u201d said Benjamin Weaver, a 32-year-old pouring ginger beer made from locally sourced ingredients, \u201cespecially since a lot of newcomers are, I guess, a bit more moneyed, there\u2019s a lot of tech coming into the city and that kind of drives up everything. \u201cYou see it in the real estate market, you see it in prices of food, you see it in the number of restaurants. Everything becomes a bit more pricey.\u201d Huge corporations might have the potential to destroy small businesses \u2013 but their heft can also create conditions where boutique retailers can flourish. \u201cSmall operations like this may not have thrived as well 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you could still be around but I feel like there is more money in the city now and more people willing to spend on pricier things.\u201d",

But, he cautioned, it could be \u201cdangerous\u201d for minnows who risk being subsumed and crushed by behemoths if a \u201csweet spot\u201d is not found.</p> <p>A shelf-stocker at the Whole Foods flagship store said he and colleagues were waiting for more information before drawing any conclusions. \u201cAs of now, I\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine \u2013 unless something drastic happens, but we won\u2019t know until it\u2019s approved in a few months.\u201d The shelf-stocker said he hoped the company\u2019s benefits package, generous for the sector, would not be affected.</p> <p>\u201cHere it\u2019s great, I get full benefits and everything,\u201d another worker said, adding that he had heard negative reports about the work environment at an Amazon warehouse but was not worried about potential job losses if Bezos\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/3/24/15054884/amazon-prime-air-public-us-drone-delivery\">drone-loving</a> company pursues a more automated approach.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m more just worried about general changes and how the salary works and benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems the CEO\u2019s remaining and all the administration\u2019s remaining so it shouldn\u2019t happen.

Like Seattle, Amazon\u2019s main base, Austin has boomed and gentrified, a process boosted by the wealth of ambitious technology outfits whose global-minded corporate cultures can seem to chafe with the cities\u2019 cherished quirky, independent characters.</p> <p>When Mackey was starting out four decades ago, the metropolitan area\u2019s population was under 600,000. Now it is over two million.</p> <p>\u201cWhole Foods has blown up,\u201d said Athena Hathaway Meskimen, a 28-year-old selling all-natural popsicles at the farmer\u2019s market. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it get big here.\u201d She also works for a local hibiscus tea company that sells its drinks through Whole Foods. \u201cFrom that perspective I think they\u2019ve done a pretty good job of trying to integrate [small businesses],\u201d she said.</p> <p>Gage, 35, said: \u201cIt changed the culture here and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever go back. I think it promoted early food culture here because now, while there are a lot of fine dining options here in Austin, a lot of emphasis on farm to table, that\u2019s something that didn\u2019t really exist until I would say 1995, here in Austin.
