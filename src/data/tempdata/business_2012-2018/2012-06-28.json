      "bodyText": "European leaders were deadlocked early on Friday over ambitions to embark on a \"big leap forward\" towards political union and rescuing the euro, with Italy and Spain engaging in a risky gamble to hold an EU summit hostage unless measures were agreed to lower the soaring costs of their borrowing. The summit struggled to agree on milder bailout formulas that would relieve the pressure of the financial markets on Spain and Italy, but Mario Monti and Mariano Rajoy, the Italian and Spanish prime ministers, decided to block endorsement of an EU \"growth pact\" until it was clear whether the two-day summit would cough up financial aid. All the evidence pointed to a bad-tempered summit. There were also rows about the location of a new European patents court, with Germany, France and Britain at odds over where the institution should be based. With the fate of the currency said to be at stake, as well as a radical new blueprint for a federalised eurozone on the table, Europe's leaders appeared bogged down on relatively minor issues. Leaders were more stridently at odds than ever before in the 30-month euro crisis. But with the stakes arguably at their highest since the currency and sovereign debt crisis erupted in Greece almost three years ago, the real substance of the summit was derailed, at least temporarily, by the Italian and Spanish hardball tactics, which were aimed at forcing Germany to soften its line on financial assistance to the weaker members of the eurozone. Monti, who has been plaintively asking Germany to budge from its refusal to accept liability for others' debt, had been expected to deliver a plan late calling for help in reducing the cost of borrowing. Instead, he linked up with the Spanish to insist that he would not sign off on the growth pact until the overall outcome of the summit became clear on Friday, witnesses said. The summit had been expected to quickly endorse the \u20ac120bn (\u00a3962bn) EU growth and jobs pact, more of a symbolic exercise in shifting the emphasis from austerity, involving little new money. It was not clear if the Italian tactic would succeed. The growth pact has been pushed mainly by France and it is the troubled economies of the eurozone, such as Italy and Spain, who are keenest to promote it to try to turn the tide on the German emphasis on austerity and fiscal discipline. German chancellor Angela Merkel appeared to have little to lose by seeing the meeting blocked and a summit failure. Early on Friday the leaders finally got down to the main topic of the summit, grappling with a \"road map\" for a 10-year march towards a eurozone political federation, embracing pooled banking, debt and fiscal policies and powers. But the leaders were also attempting to come up with immediate steps to help Italy and Spain. The Italian and Spanish tactics suggested that attempts to agree on short-term measures to shore up their public finances were not going well. German officials maintained a tough line, insisting that there were instruments available to help, such as two eurozone bailout funds. But Italy would have to request aid and accept the same tough terms borne by others who had been rescued. Monti had used the runup to the summit to warn of disaster if his pleas went unheard, while Rajoy had declared that Madrid's borrowing costs were at the brink of what was affordable, despite the benchmark 10-year yield falling below 7%. Various options were being canvassed to help Italy and Spain while observing the German penchant for sticking to the rules governing the bailout funds and the role of the European Central Bank (ECB). One option, said to have been mooted by the Germans, was to use the temporary bailout fund \u2013 the European Financial Stability Facility \u2013 to absorb excessive Italian and Spanish borrowing costs. Italy would be guaranteed an interest rate of, say, 4%. If the markets charged Italy more, the bailout fund would soak up the difference. There is only \u20ac240bn left in the EFSF, unlikely to be enough to deal with Italy and Spain. More arcane schemes using the fund as an insurance instrument were being mooted, while other ideas included using the bailout funds to buy up Italian or Spanish bonds, or having the ECB act similarly in the secondary markets \u2013 since the bank is not allowed to finance eurozone governments directly. Arguments flared over issues of seniority in the bailouts, with Spain seeking changes to the terms so that private creditors would not be subordinate to the bailout fund in debt repayments. Despite signs that the leaders were seeking a short-term fix while wrangling over the longer-term masterplan for a eurozone political union, the deadlock did not augur well for a breakthrough later on Friday. EU leaders appeared more divided than ever. After talks on Wednesday between Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, it was clear from the remarks of German officials that there was no meeting of minds; Paris and Berlin were seriously split at a summit for the first time in the crisis. \"No sign of any warming between Berlin and Paris,\" said an EU official.",

    "webTitle": "David Cameron turns up the heat on Barclays: 'This must go right to the top'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays' chief executive, Bob Diamond, is fighting to keep his job after the prime minister said accountability for the bank's admission that it had manipulated key interest rates should go right to the top of the bank. In a letter sent to Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, Diamond said the bank's traders who had attempted to rig the rate for their own profit were guilty of \"wholly inappropriate behaviour\". He said: \"They were operating purely for their own benefit\" but insisted the rates they had distorted had not had any impact on ordinary savers and mortgage borrowers. He also promised to claw back bonuses, withhold pay and fire those responsible for the scandal. However, Diamond's position will take yet another hit on Friday as the embattled bank is braced for the details of a new mis-selling scandal to be released. David Cameron's attack on Barclays \u2013 which incurred \u00a3290m of fines for its role in fixing rates that affect the cost at which millions of customers can borrow \u2013 came as the bank's shares plunged 15%, wiping almost \u00a34bn off the value of Barclays in its biggest one-day fall since March 2009. \"People have to take responsibility for the actions and show how they're going to be accountable for these actions,\" said Cameron. \"It's very important that goes all the way to the top of the organisation.\" The intervention by politicians, including the chancellor, George Osborne, who described the rate-fixing as \"a shocking indictment of the culture at banks like Barclays\", came amid expectations of a criminal investigation and a potential bill for the banking industry that one analyst, Sandy Chen of Cenkos, warned could \"run into the billions\". The damage to Barclays' reputation could result in the bank losing its status as premier member of Business in the Community, where Prince Charles is president. A spokeswoman explained that there was a formal removal process, which has not yet been implemented. She added: \"The matter is being discussed internally, but it is too early to say whether Barclays membership of the organisation would be formally reviewed.\" Sharp falls in the share prices of the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group evoked memories of the darkest days of the banking crisis as the potential scale of the interest rate-fixing scandal emerged and ahead of an announcement by the Financial Services Authority about the mis-selling of financial products to small businesses. Barclays and RBS are expected to be at the centre of the City regulator's warning that complex interest rates swaps were mis-sold to small businesses and that redress would need to be paid to thousands of out-of-pocket customers. As the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, called for a criminal investigation into the interest rate manipulation, Osborne told MPs that the Serious Fraud Office was \"aware\" of the inquiry by the City regulator into the practice. Barclays was fined for attempting to manipulate crucial interest rates known as the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor) between 2005 and 2009. They are benchmark rates that play a crucial role in determining the cost of borrowing for households and companies. Osborne said there were \"ongoing discussions\" between the FSA and SFO and that he was looking for ways to direct the \u00a359.5m fine levied on Barclays into the hands of taxpayers rather than back to the FSA. US regulators were responsible for the remaining \u00a3230m of fines. The regulators' investigations uncovered a wave of damning emails in which Barclays staff were offered bottles of Bollinger champagne as payment or their names printed in \"golden letters\" for changing interest rates. In an effort to demonstrate a willingness to clampdown on the City, Osborne promised he would unveil powers for criminal convictions at collapsed banks next week. Even though he made it clear that Barclays was not the only bank caught up in the manipulation of interest rates, he turned up the heat on Diamond. \"As far as the chief executive of Barclays is concerned, he has some very serious questions to answer today. What did he know and when did he know it? Who in the Barclays management was involved and who therefore should pay the price?\" said Osborne. Diamond has been summoned before the Treasury select committee, chaired by Tyrie, who said: \"I fear it's not going to be the end of the story, that we are going to find other banks have been involved.\" Among the others co-operating with an international investigation are HSBC, RBS, Lloyds and the Swiss bank UBS. They are among 15 banks that submit prices to the benchmark Libor rate. The British Bankers Association said it was \"shocked\" at the findings of the FSA and and US authorities, and called for the government to take over the job. In politically-charged language pointing the finger at Labour for lax regulation of the City during the period of the offences, the chancellor said the interest rate fixing was \"evidence of systemic greed at the expense of financial integrity and stability\" in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The business secretary, Vince Cable, told the Business, Innovation and Skills committee that directors could be struck off \"if the facts suggested action\". Despite the clamour for a senior executive to take responsibility, executives were said to be determined to hold on to their jobs. Shareholders appeared to be preparing the ground for the exit of the chairman, Marcus Agius. They want to meet the bank's senior independent director, Sir Michael Rake, to discuss the reputational damage caused by the regulatory action. While the political attention is focused on Diamond, shareholders indicated that Agius could be the first to be forced out after an already turbulent relationship with investors caused by the row over Diamond's \u00a317m pay deal last year. The National Association of Pension Funds also indicated its frustration with the bank. David Paterson, head of corporate governance, has asked the bank to claw back bonuses and other long-term incentive plans that cover the period of the rate fixing, but has yet to get a response. The high pay of Diamond's pay - who has taken home nearly \u00a3100m since 2006 - prompted the former chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland to tell the Today Programme that there were \"very high expectations of him\" in the light of the fines. Although the FSA does not have powers to impose criminal sanctions for manipulating interest rates, leading lawyers said that the Barclays traders may have broken the law. Andrew Oldland QC, a former SFO prosecutor and now a partner at City law firm Michelmores, said: \"It has got the potential for fraud. The key thing with fraud versus the regulatory rules is it requires proof of a dishonest intent and if the authorities think they can prove that the chances are they can select a whole host of charges.\"",

Iona Fabian Aston, Oxfordshire \u2022 On your front page (Barclays fined \u00a3290m ... , 28 June) we have, yet again, the misuse of the word \"earned\". We are told that \"... [Bob] Diamond \u2013 who has earned almost \u00a3100m from Barclays since 2006 ...\". He may have been paid that remarkable sum, but \"earned\" it? The average salary in the UK is around \u00a325k pa (\u00a3150k over six years). I do not think it is physically possible for an individual to work 666 times as hard as the average person (though the number may be significant). I doubt Diamond thinks the words \"earned\" and \"paid\" are synonymous, but I think most of us would disagree. It would be nice if the Guardian could also discriminate between them. John Hall Telford, Shropshire \u2022 Thank heavens for the bonus culture that enables UK banks to recruit top talent. Imagine what a shambles they would be if they were run and staffed by greedy, unprincipled muppets. David Guest Tring, Hertfordshire",

Osborne claimed the Labour government had been \"literally clueless about what was going on\", adding: \"The Labour party's trouble is that it is led by the cheerleaders for the age of irresponsibility, but they have yet to say sorry for it.\" He added: \"Shockingly, the scope of the FSA's criminal powers, granted by the previous government, does not extend to being able to impose criminal sanctions for manipulation of Libor.\" Osborne's assault on the absence of criminal sanctions was helped by an own goal by Lord Tunnicliffe, the Labour Treasury spokesman. Referring to criminal sanctions, he told peers: \"It is fair to say that you cannot find them in the current legislation, and yes, OK, it is our fault \u2013 I hope my leaders do not hear me say that. \"One of the reasons is that it is extraordinarily difficult to bring criminal sanctions into an area such as this where the criminal burden of proof is so high.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bob Diamond-Marcus Agius double act at the top of Barclays Bank is surely drawing to a close. It's an open question whether Barclays' chief executive or its chairman will go first. In the end, both may have to depart if a two-stage shuffle is deemed the least embarrassing way to defuse the crisis. But a resignation will have to come \u2013 and quickly. When the prime minister says that responsibility and accountability should go \"all the way to the top of the organisation\", the writing is on the wall. Why don't Diamond and Agius see that? They may feel that Barclays' sins in the Libor scandal are no greater than those of other banks \u2013 a view that may be vindicated when the Financial Services Authority and the US regulators have completed their investigations. Barclays' top duo may tell themselves that it's terribly unfair that they should be singled out for personal chastisement before the outside world appreciates the scale and depth of global banks' attempts to rig the money markets. Tough. Each bank must be held accountable for its own culture and it's as plain as day from the FSA and US reports that something went horribly wrong in parts of Barclays Capital, the investment banking division (then run by Diamond), in the years 2005-09. Clearly, Agius and Diamond cannot be expected to know everything that happens within the bank. But it is reasonable to expect that they lay down the law on the types of behaviour that are acceptable and appoint trusted enforcers to police the joint. The portrait that emerges of Barclays' derivatives department is of a place where basic rules were routinely and knowingly broken. Libor, as everybody within BarCap should have known, is sacrosanct \u2013 you just don't submit inaccurate information, even if you suspect everybody else is doing so. Agius became chairman in 2006 and part of his appeal was meant to be his standing as an old-school financier who would ensure that traditional City virtues survived in the brasher world of 21st-century investment banking. Instead, too often, Agius has found himself cast as apologist-in-chief for modern banking's bonus culture. If he were ever the man to constrain the wilder ways of BarCap's derivatives dudes, he's not now. His usefulness to Barclays as a charming and articulate promoter of the principles of \"good citizenship\" has evaporated. From shareholders' point of view, Diamond \u2013 chief executive since John Varley's retirement in 2010 \u2013 would be the more severe loss. BarCap is the business he built and it has been the dominant contributor to the group's profits in recent years. It is not too fanciful to imagine the BarCap project unravelling without Diamond's confident presence at Canary Wharf. Diamond, when his fire is up, is fond of damning dreary Brits for their failure to celebrate BarCap's success. He had a point: Warburg, Kleinwort Benson and many other famous UK merchant banks lost their independence after the Big Bang in 1986. Some were taken over by foreign megabanks, and Barings imploded. Diamond's unique triumph was to build BarCap into a top player out of the ashes of Barclays' own fumbling investment banking venture, BZW. But the reason why many Brits have been so reluctant to applaud Diamond's creation should now be clear. As George Osborne put it: \"The FSA report is a shocking indictment of the culture at banks like Barclays in the runup to the financial crisis.\" Barclays would probably agree. Its statement on Wednesday expressed \"utmost regret\" for actions that \"fell well short of the standards to which Barclays aspires in the conduct of its business\". But it would also argue that Diamond is the right man to ensure the bank has truly reformed. It's that notion that now lacks credibility. There's no reason to doubt the sincerity of Diamond's statements about the importance of trust and honesty in banking, but he carries the baggage of Barclays' past. When the past keeps exploding on to the front pages of newspapers, the boss is in danger of becoming bad for business. With no fans in Westminster, and dissent in the shareholder ranks, Diamond's effectiveness as a leader and advocate of Barclays' interests is weakened. But maybe there is another reason for the lack of a resignation. The Libor scandal seems very likely to trigger civil claims for damages against banks. Have Barclays' lawyers advised the directors that a resignation might make the legal position worse? That's one theory in circulation.

BarCap is the business he built and it has been the dominant contributor to the group's profits in recent years. It is not too fanciful to imagine the BarCap project unravelling without Diamond's confident presence at Canary Wharf.</p> <p>Diamond, when his fire is up, is fond of damning dreary Brits for their failure to celebrate BarCap's success. He had a point: Warburg, Kleinwort Benson and many other famous UK merchant banks lost their independence after the Big Bang in 1986. Some were taken over by foreign megabanks, and Barings imploded. Diamond's unique triumph was to build BarCap into a top player out of the ashes of Barclays' own fumbling investment banking venture, BZW.</p> <p>But the reason why many Brits have been so reluctant to applaud Diamond's creation should now be clear. As George Osborne put it: \"The FSA report is a shocking indictment of the culture at banks like Barclays in the runup to the financial crisis.\"</p> <p>Barclays would probably agree. Its statement on Wednesday expressed \"utmost regret\" for actions that \"fell well short of the standards to which Barclays aspires in the conduct of its business\". But it would also argue that Diamond is the right man to ensure the bank has truly reformed.</p> <p>It's that notion that now lacks credibility. There's no reason to doubt the sincerity of Diamond's statements about the importance of trust and honesty in banking, but he carries the baggage of Barclays' past. When the past keeps exploding on to the front pages of newspapers, the boss is in danger of becoming bad for business. With no fans in Westminster, and dissent in the shareholder ranks, Diamond's effectiveness as a leader and advocate of Barclays' interests is weakened.</p> <p>But maybe there is another reason for the lack of a resignation. The Libor scandal seems very likely to trigger civil claims for damages against banks. Have Barclays' lawyers advised the directors that a resignation might make the legal position worse? That's one theory in&#xa0;circulation.</p> <h2>Barclays directors<br></h2> <p><strong>Chairman </strong>Marcus Agius, 65 \u2013 former investment banker.

      "body": "<p>European leaders came under intense pressure on Thursday night to embark on a \"big leap forward\" towards political union and rescue for the euro, while groping for milder bailout formulas that would relieve the pressure on Spain and Italy and help to reduce their cost of borrowing.</p> <p>At a two-day EU summit in Brussels, leaders were more stridently at odds than ever before in the 30-month crisis, but with the stakes also arguably at their highest, frantic moves were being made behind the scenes to avoid serious acrimony.</p> <p>Mario Monti, the beleaguered Italian prime minister who has been plaintively asking Germany to shift from its refusal to accept liability for others' debt, was expected to deliver a plan later calling for help in reducing the cost of borrowing.</p> <p>Publicly and privately, senior German officials maintained a tough line, insisting there were instruments available to help, such as two eurozone bailout funds. Italy would have to request aid and accept the same tough terms borne by others who have been rescued.</p> <p>Monti used the run-up to the summit to warn of disaster if his pleas went unheard, while Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, declared that Madrid's borrowing costs were at the brink of what was affordable despite the benchmark 10-year yield falling below 7%.</p> <p>Various options were being canvassed to help Italy and Spain while observing the German penchant for sticking to the rules governing the bailout funds and the role of the European Central Bank (ECB).</p> <p>One option, said to be mooted by the Germans, was to use the temporary bailout fund \u2013 the European Financial Stability Facility \u2013 to absorb excessive Italian and Spanish borrowing costs. Italy would be guaranteed an interest rate of, say, 4%.

      "bodyText": "European leaders came under intense pressure on Thursday night to embark on a \"big leap forward\" towards political union and rescue for the euro, while groping for milder bailout formulas that would relieve the pressure on Spain and Italy and help to reduce their cost of borrowing. At a two-day EU summit in Brussels, leaders were more stridently at odds than ever before in the 30-month crisis, but with the stakes also arguably at their highest, frantic moves were being made behind the scenes to avoid serious acrimony. Mario Monti, the beleaguered Italian prime minister who has been plaintively asking Germany to shift from its refusal to accept liability for others' debt, was expected to deliver a plan later calling for help in reducing the cost of borrowing. Publicly and privately, senior German officials maintained a tough line, insisting there were instruments available to help, such as two eurozone bailout funds. Italy would have to request aid and accept the same tough terms borne by others who have been rescued. Monti used the run-up to the summit to warn of disaster if his pleas went unheard, while Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, declared that Madrid's borrowing costs were at the brink of what was affordable despite the benchmark 10-year yield falling below 7%. Various options were being canvassed to help Italy and Spain while observing the German penchant for sticking to the rules governing the bailout funds and the role of the European Central Bank (ECB). One option, said to be mooted by the Germans, was to use the temporary bailout fund \u2013 the European Financial Stability Facility \u2013 to absorb excessive Italian and Spanish borrowing costs. Italy would be guaranteed an interest rate of, say, 4%. If the markets charged Italy more, the bailout fund would soak up the difference. There is only \u20ac240bn left in the EFSF, unlikely to be enough to deal with Italy and Spain. More arcane schemes using the fund as an insurance instrument were being mooted while other schemes included using the bailout funds to buy up Italian or Spanish bonds, or have the ECB act similarly in the secondary markets \u2013 since the bank is not allowed to finance eurozone governments directly. Arguments flared over issues of seniority in the bailouts, with Spain seeking changes to the terms so that private creditors would not be subordinate to the bailout fund in debt repayments. The summit quickly endorsed an EU growth and jobs pact, more of a symbolic exercise in shifting the emphasis from austerity, and then grappled with a \"road-map\" for a 10-year march towards a eurozone political federation, embracing pooled banking, debt and fiscal policies and powers. Despite signs the leaders were seeking a short-term fix, while wrangling over the longer-term masterplan for a eurozone political union, no decisions were expected until later today at a separate summit for the 17 eurozone countries. With the stakes arguably at their highest since the currency and sovereign debt crisis erupted in Greece almost three years ago, the leaders appeared more divided than ever despite the attempts to find a formula that might calm the markets. After talks between the two key leaders, Angela Merkel of Germany and Francois Hollande of France on Wednesday, it was clear from the remarks of senior German officials there was no meeting of minds, meaning that Paris and Berlin were seriously split at a summit for the first time in the crisis. \"No sign of any warming between Berlin and Paris,\" said a senior EU official. \"Unless France and Germany can soon agree on a grand bargain, disaster may loom,\" said Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform. While France was more favourable towards the blueprint for a eurozone federation, senior German officials were strongly critical. The summit was expected to give Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European council, a mandate to refine the scheme by the end of the year. The first stage in the integrationist leap would be to establish a banking union, probably putting eurozone banks under the supervisory authority of the ECB. While officials said this was a huge, complex and detailed undertaking the Germans insisted there could be no common European guarantees for savers' deposits or funds to wind up bad banks until a functioning European supervisory and regulatory system was working well. Britain is adamant it will have no part in banking union and David Cameron indicated he is prepared to wield a veto again to protect the City of London by fighting off any changes that would change the EU's single market. The prime minister used last night's dinner to demand \"safeguards\" though he believes it is in Britain's interests for eurozone leaders to follow what he and George Osborne call the \"remorseless logic\" of monetary union and take decisive steps towards fiscal union. The prime minister, who blocked eurozone leaders from embedding their fiscal compact in EU treaties last December, indicated he may wield the veto for a second time. \"We are saying to the eurozone countries they do need to do more things together to strengthen the currency and make sense of their currency,\" Cameron said as he arrived in Brussels. \"But Britain is going to stay out of that. We want Europe to work for us, as a single market, as a place where we trade, as a place where we co-operate. I'm going in there so that we get the safeguards to make sure that can keep happening.\" Britain's dilemma is brought into sharp focus by banking union, which it supports but fears could change the single market. Britain is pleased the paper says that an integrated financial framework needs to be done in a way that preserves the \"unity and integrity of the single market\". But it has concerns that about plans to create a single European banking supervision system. While this would operate at an EU and a national level, the paper says the \"European level would have ultimate responsibility\". Britain will insist that two key elements of such a union \u2013 a single regulator and the mutualisation of risks in which banks stand behind one another \u2013 must be limited to the eurozone.

Coupled with this week's public finance figures, which showed the deficit deepening; and the fact that this week's euro summit is unlikely to come up with a solution, the figures reveal a picture of an economy \u2013 and an economic policy \u2013 in deep trouble. When ratings agency Fitch put the UK on a warning that it could lose its AAA rating in March, it warned of \"very limited fiscal space to absorb further adverse economic shocks in light of such elevated debt levels and a potentially weaker than currently forecast economic recovery\". Unfortunately, the storm that's breaking in the eurozone is exactly the kind of \"adverse shock\" they were talking about \u2013 and the ONS's snapshot confirms that it's buffeting an economy that's more like a windswept wreck than a safe haven.",

      "bodyText": "A war of attrition over Xstrata is being predicted as its major shareholder and proposed merger partner, Glencore, retired to consider its next move after its \u00a316bn deal was rejected by the mining group's second largest shareholder from Qatar. Glencore refused to comment on whether it would improve on its current offer of 2.8 of its shares for each Xstrata share, or walk away from the proposed deal completely. A third Xstrata shareholder praised the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, Qatar Holding, on Wednesday for refusing to support a \"fire sale\". Both Xstrata and Glencore saw their shares fall on Thursday, the former by 2%. Qatar made its dramatic intervention late on Tuesday night and Jake Greenberg, a mining analyst at the London arm of US investment bank Jefferies, said there was no reason to expect any counter-move from Glencore in the near future. \"I do not think on the basis of how Ivan Glasenberg [the chief executive of Glencore] has acted in the past that we are going to see a decision in the next couple of days. This is not his negotiating style,\" he said. Greenberg noted that an earlier proposed tie-up between Vale of Brazil and Xstrata had only finally hit the rocks after long-drawn-out negotiations with Glencore, which holds 34% of Xstrata. In the current row, the Qataris, who own 11% of the mining company, have demanded at least 3.25 Glencore shares for each Xstrata share. The Financial Times reported that Glencore was threatening to \"walk away\" rather than increase its offer. Some mining-industry analysts, who asked not to be identified, believed that threat was just a negotiating tactic by Glencore and said there was a good chance Glasenberg would come back with at least a 3.0-shares compromise offer that could yet be enough to bring Qatar Holding back to the table. Xstrata, whose board had already agreed the 2.8-share deal, said it was continuing talks with its own shareholders but denied this was anything but \"routine\". Xstrata is understood to have already held 300 meetings with investors, speaking to some three times, in a bid to convince them to support the offer. Sentiment over the deal has been soured already by what many saw as over-generous post-merger incentive payments for the management, which have now been reduced. One substantial Xstrata shareholder, who also asked to remain anonymous, made clear it was delighted with the hardline stance from the Middle East investor: \"Qatar Holding, with its sensible view on the merger ratio, has cut through the smoke and mirrors \u2026 It's clear Glencore needs this deal far more than Xstrata does and we're not interested in what feels like a fire sale.\"",

      "body": "<p>On a day dominated by banks in the wake of <strong>Barclays</strong>' \u00a3290m fine for manipulating interest rates and the eurozone, Cillit Bang-owner <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> was also under pressure.</p> <p>Reckitt's shares have been slipping for a while on competition concerns and - more -recently - downbeat statements from rival consumer groups including Procter &amp; Gamble.</p> <p>They fell another 77p to \u00a333 following negative comments from analysts at RBC and Credit Suisse. RBS began coverage of the company with an underperform rating and a \u00a332 a share price target, saying:</p> <blockquote> The progressive lack of pricing power at Reckitt Benckiser indicates, in our view, a decline in brand equity brought about by several years of prioritising earnings per share at the expense of revenue investment. We do not believe the plan to invest an incremental \u00a3100 million goes far enough and believe margins will remain under pressure. <br> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Credit Suisse moved from outperform to neutral and cut its price target from \u00a338 to \u00a335. Analyst Charlie Mills said:</p> <blockquote> We are reducing our 2012 and 2013 earnings per share estimates by 7% in equal parts for foreign exchange and lower operating assumptions (in Europe/US in particular). <br> Reckitt's historical outperformance in the marketplace was driven by its almost unique ability to garner growth from the developed markets, and in particular Europe. This hasn't been the case for two to three years now, and we don't see that changing any time soon. In part it is market, but market share is also a contributory factor, and competition isn't about to ease off.  Reckitt shares have had a lot thrown at them this year \u2013 index reweighting, large share placings, weak first quarter sales, P&amp;G set to kick-start their business, generic Mucinex launched, raw material headwinds etc. Despite this the shares are up 6% year to date (European market down 8%, UK down 2%).

      "bodyText": "On a day dominated by banks in the wake of Barclays' \u00a3290m fine for manipulating interest rates and the eurozone, Cillit Bang-owner Reckitt Benckiser was also under pressure. Reckitt's shares have been slipping for a while on competition concerns and - more -recently - downbeat statements from rival consumer groups including Procter &amp; Gamble. They fell another 77p to \u00a333 following negative comments from analysts at RBC and Credit Suisse. RBS began coverage of the company with an underperform rating and a \u00a332 a share price target, saying: The progressive lack of pricing power at Reckitt Benckiser indicates, in our view, a decline in brand equity brought about by several years of prioritising earnings per share at the expense of revenue investment. We do not believe the plan to invest an incremental \u00a3100 million goes far enough and believe margins will remain under pressure. Meanwhile Credit Suisse moved from outperform to neutral and cut its price target from \u00a338 to \u00a335. Analyst Charlie Mills said: We are reducing our 2012 and 2013 earnings per share estimates by 7% in equal parts for foreign exchange and lower operating assumptions (in Europe/US in particular). Reckitt's historical outperformance in the marketplace was driven by its almost unique ability to garner growth from the developed markets, and in particular Europe. This hasn't been the case for two to three years now, and we don't see that changing any time soon. In part it is market, but market share is also a contributory factor, and competition isn't about to ease off. Reckitt shares have had a lot thrown at them this year \u2013 index reweighting, large share placings, weak first quarter sales, P&amp;G set to kick-start their business, generic Mucinex launched, raw material headwinds etc. Despite this the shares are up 6% year to date (European market down 8%, UK down 2%). With a challenging backdrop, and a valuation in line with staples, we reduce our rating to neutral. But the main talking point - apart from the EU summit where contradictory signals as always were emerging - was the interest rate manipulation by Barclays. The scandal sent the bank's shares tumbling 30.45p to 165.6p, a 15.5% decline. Analysts were betting a \u00a3290m fine and executives giving up their bonuses was not the end of it.

Royal Bank of Scotland fell 26.7p to 206.4p, Lloyds Banking Group lost 1.215p to 29.94p while HSBC dropped 14.8p to 558.2p. Between them, the four banks knocked around 29 points off the FTSE 100, accounting for the bulk of its 30.86 point drop to 5493.06. Analyst Sandy Chen at Cenkos said: We expect that the costs of lawsuits related to Libor manipulation will dwarf the \u00a3290m in fines imposed on Barclays \u2013 and since RBS, HSBC and Lloyds have also been named in lawsuits, we expect they will also face significant fines and damages. We are pencilling in multi-year provisions that could run into the billions. Investors were seeking havens in the storm, with United Utilities up 15.5p at 674.5p and Severn Trent 22p better at \u00a316.45. Elsewhere Ladbrokes' gamble on boosting its online betting presence has not proved a winner so far, and a disappointing update from the division saw the bookmaker's shares slump by 12%. In a trading update released to coincide with an investor day, the bookie said digital profits would be worse than expected due to poor margins in the second quarter and technology delays. The company had been talking up its online gambling sites, with heavy TV advertising. It had already said the increased marketing and investment, as well as losses associated with new international licences, would see a first half decline in digital profits year on year. But the new problems meant Ladbrokes - down 21.1p at 152.7p - now expected six month profits from the division to be halved from last year's figure. Meanwhile online gaming group Bwin.partydigital was also in decline, hit by UBS cutting its price target from 165p to 125p after Wednesday's news the sale of a poker business had fallen through, and worries about German taxes.

As pressure mounted on the Barclays boss, Bob Diamond, Miliband told the Unite union conference that the case represented the worst example of the irresponsible, predatory capitalism he first highlighted at the Labour conference last autumn.

Calling for a change of mindset, including taxing bankers' bonuses and guaranteeing jobs for young people, Miliband promised to work with unions to help the party rebuild the economy in a fairer way if it won power again.

Chief executive Vittorio Colao has decided to split Vodafone's freshly vacated European chief executive role in two. Humm has the plum job, overseeing networks in Europe's strongest economies, from the UK and Germany to the Netherlands and the Czech Republic.</p> <p>In a geographical conjuring trick, Turkey has become part of northern Europe for the purposes of this reorganisation. It is Vodafone's fastest growing business and Colao did not want its success diluted by association with struggling southern European markets.</p> <p>Overseeing these more challenging businesses, which include networks in Greece, Albania and Spain, will be Vodafone Italy's chief executive, Paolo Bertoluzzo, who holds on to his day job.</p> <p>The eurozone may not be ready to break up just yet but Vodafone has decided the time has come.

      "bodyText": "In one of the fastest comebacks in corporate history Philipp Humm, who announced on Wednesday that he was returning to Europe to spend more time with his family after two bruising years as boss of T-Mobile's US business, was unveiled on Thursday as Vodafone's new north and central Europe chief executive. Humm was at the helm during Deutsche Telekom's efforts to exit the US by selling its T-Mobile business to AT&amp;T, a merger which was blocked by regulators and has left the parent company casting about for other sources of cash. His new remit is more upbeat. Chief executive Vittorio Colao has decided to split Vodafone's freshly vacated European chief executive role in two. Humm has the plum job, overseeing networks in Europe's strongest economies, from the UK and Germany to the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. In a geographical conjuring trick, Turkey has become part of northern Europe for the purposes of this reorganisation. It is Vodafone's fastest growing business and Colao did not want its success diluted by association with struggling southern European markets. Overseeing these more challenging businesses, which include networks in Greece, Albania and Spain, will be Vodafone Italy's chief executive, Paolo Bertoluzzo, who holds on to his day job. The eurozone may not be ready to break up just yet but Vodafone has decided the time has come. Dividing the region will help Colao focus investors' attention on the best performers while blaming economic turmoil for difficulties further south. Eliminating the number two role may also buy Colao more time in the top job. \"Splitting the key succession role in two suggests succession is not imminent,\" says analyst Robin Bienenstock at Sanford C Bernstein. \"You are diluting the role, and creating a bit of competitive tension.\" If Vodafone is succession planning, it is doing so in slow motion. The new structure suggests Colao's exit is some way off.",

Barclays traders were pushing the Libor rate up at one stage (to enhance their profits), which could have pushed mortgage rates higher than they should have been.

      "bodyText": "The UK has fallen deeper into recession than previously thought, confirming that the country has officially entered a double-dip. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the economy shrank faster than previously estimated between October and December last year, with a decline of 0.4%. The economy also contracted for a second quarter between January and March this year, with the unchanged -0.3% estimate confirming that we are in recession for the second time in four years. A drop in construction and industrial output in the first three months of the year outweighed the biggest rise in government spending in almost seven years, scuppering chancellor George Osborne's hopes of a recovery led by the private sector. Construction fell at its fastest pace in three years, down 4.9%, while industrial output was down by 0.5%. Government spending, meanwhile, rose by 1.9%. The ONS said the crucial measure of household consumption fell 0.1% after increasing 0.5% in the final quarter of 2011. On an annual basis, it dropped by almost 1%. Household consumption makes up about 60% of the UK's GDP, so a decline in spending has a huge impact on the economy. The household saving ratio fell to 6.4% in the first quarter from 6.9% in the previous quarter, suggesting consumers may have been dipping into their savings for the little spending they have been doing. Separately the ONS published data showing the UK's current account deficit widened more than expected to \u00a311.2bn in the first quarter from \u00a37.2bn in the previous quarter. The deficit was much larger than expectations of a \u00a39bn shortfall, and represents some 2.9% of GDP.

      "bodyText": "The boss of Barclays, Bob Diamond, is under mounting pressure after the bank was hit with fines of \u00a3290m for its \"serious, widespread\" role in trying to manipulate the price of crucial interest rates that affect the cost of borrowing for millions of customers around the world. There were calls for Diamond to step down after the Financial Services Authority slapped a \u00a359.5m fine on the bank \u2013 the largest ever levied by the City regulator - forcing him and other top executives to forgo any bonuses for 2012. The FSA \u2013 and authorities in the US which hit Barclays with penalties of \u00a3230m \u2013 described repeated breaches of rules dating back to 2005. They involved \"a significant number of employees\", including senior managers, and called into question the integrity of the markets. The FSA published embarrassing email exchanges in which Barclays staff were offered bottles of Bollinger champagne as payment for favours or their names printed in \"golden letters\". The emails demonstrated how traders manipulated the price of key interest rates in an attempt to make greater profits. The regulators, including the US department of justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said Barclays had also taken steps to fix the rates as the bank was concerned about its public image during the 2008 financial crisis. Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, described Barclays' activities as \"inexcusable\". The shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie asked whether there should be a criminal investigation. The fines come as Diamond \u2013 who has earned almost \u00a3100m from Barclays since 2006 and was at the time running the division where the misconduct took place \u2013 has been trumpeting the bank's commitment to acting as a \"good citizen\", despite the bank's run-in with HM Revenue &amp; Customs over a \u00a3500m tax avoidance scheme and a row with shareholders over his \u00a317m pay packet this year. Barclays said Diamond and his three close lieutenants \u2013 the head of investment banking, Rich Ricci; chief operating officer, Jerry del Missier, and finance director, Chris Lucas \u2013 would forfeit their bonuses this year as a result of the attempted manipulation. But they will still be in line for multi-million pound share payouts. The penalties levied on Barclays are part of an international investigation involving a number of banks \u2013 including RBS and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 into interest rates known as the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor). The two key rates play a key role in determining the cost of borrowing for households and companies. Politicians rounded on Barclays. Tyrie said: \"This was a serious breach. I am very concerned about it. The price-setting mechanism of Libor is crucial to the integrity of the markets. This appears to have been put at risk. From the information I have, it looks inexcusable.\" Liberal Democrat MP Lord Oakeshott said Diamond should quit. \"This does terrible damage to Barclays' own reputation, the integrity of the city of London and many people's waning trust in capitalism and free markets ... He's got to go and Barclays must be broken up \u2013 it's far too dangerous in these dangerous times.\" In a statement Diamond said: \"Nothing is more important to me than having a strong culture at Barclays. I am sorry that some people acted in a manner not consistent with our culture and values.\" Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and financial crime at the FSA, said Barclays' misconduct was \"serious, widespread and extended over a number of years\". She said that Barclays traders' attempts to manipulate interest rates \"to try to benefit trading positions is wholly unacceptable. \"This was possible because Barclays failed to ensure it had proper controls in place. Barclays' behaviour threatened the integrity of the rates with the risk of serious harm to other market participants\" The individuals at Barclays, known as submitters, who were responsible for setting the interest rates emailed responses to traders such as \"always happy to help,\" \"for you, anything,\" or \"done \u2026 for you big boy,\" after submitting rates that were incorrect. Lord Myners, the former City minister under the Labour government, told Newsnight: \"This behaviour will only change if people face the prospect of criminal charges.\" David Meister, the CFTC's director of enforcement, said the investigation had been launched to \"protect the markets and the public from such illegal conduct.\" He added: \"Today's action demonstrates that we will bring the full force of our authority to bear as we carry out that mission\". Libor is used as a benchmark for setting financial contracts and interest rates around the world. It is overseen by the British Bankers' Association. Banks are asked what rate they expect to pay to borrow from each other for periods of time ranging from overnight to 12 months in currencies including sterling, dollars, euros, yen and Swiss francs. The banks responses are then averaged to come up with a single Libor figure. The FSA found that Barclays had been making submissions to the process that were intended to allow the bank to make profits when its traders speculated on interest rates. The bank also reduced the rates it submitted during the financial crisis because Barclays' managers thought the true, higher rates were being interpreted by the media as evidence that the bank was short of cash. Barclays said it had received credit from the authorties for \"extensive co-operation, as well as the actions it has taken to enhance its systems and controls\".",
