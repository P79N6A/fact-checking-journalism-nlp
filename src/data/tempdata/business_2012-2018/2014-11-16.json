      "bodyText": "In a speech on Monday, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane is to criticise a failure to discuss banking issues by monetary policymakers before the financial crisis, and warn that \u201ccollective blind-spots\u201d may still exist on the committee. Haldane will say he was closely watching for signs inflation in the UK would fall below the Bank\u2019s target. In his speech about the psychology of central banking, Haldane will praise various features of the policy-setting framework that help guard against \u201ccognitive ticks that can affect human decision-making\u201d. But on so-called \u201cgroupthink\u201d, where people tend to adapt their view to conform to those around them, he sees evidence of shortcomings ahead of the collapse of Northern Rock, then Lehman Brothers and the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d that followed. He\u2019ll say it was too soon to tell whether other collective blind spots remained on the monetary policy committee (MPC). Referring to work by researchers at Warwick University, which analysed minutes from MPC meetings, Haldane points out that banking issues were low down on the agenda during the period of economic calm prior to the crisis known as the \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d, but rose up as the crisis struck. \u201cFor the decade prior to 2007, banking issues did not get much of a look-in. They typically accounted for only around 2% of MPC discussion time during the Great Moderation. With hindsight, given emerging pressures in the banking sector, this was a collective blind spot,\u201d Haldane will tell a Royal College of Medicine conference. \u201cIt is too soon to tell whether any collective blind spots remain. But compared with the pre-crisis period, the Bank today has two extra pairs of policy eyes through the prudential regulation authority (PRA) and financial policy committee (FPC). Joint meetings between the MPC, FPC and the PRA board now take place. These help strengthen the committees\u2019 peripheral vision and are a safeguard against groupthink.\u201d. His speech will go on: \u201cImprovements to the Bank\u2019s forecasting process have some considerable distance still to travel\u201d. Haldane, who joined the MPC in June, gives little away on his current view over the best path for interest rates in the speech. He has been widely described as a \u201cdove\u201d on borrowing costs, erring towards looser policy, and recently described himself as having grown \u201cgloomier\u201d over the economy. Last week, the Bank signalled interest rates could remain on hold at the record low of 0.5% until next autumn as inflation is likely to fall below 1% in early 2015. The Bank has a government-set target of inflation of 2% on the consumer prices index (CPI) measure and has to write an open letter to the chancellor if the target missed by more than 1 percentage point on either side. Haldane will also raise the threat of low inflation in his speech on Monday, highlighting what he see as success in keeping inflation in check, or taming the \u201cinflation tiger\u201d, by giving central banks independence and increasing public confidence that inflation will not be allowed to climb too high, but he will warn such a public view can work the other way in the form of low and falling inflation expectations. \u201cAs some countries are finding today, the tiger is capable of biting back,\u201d Haldane says. \u201cSo far, inflation expectations in the UK have held up and, on a central view, the Bank expects inflation to be on target at a 2-3 year horizon. But this tiger needs careful handling. Even in the UK, some measures of household inflation expectations have fallen slightly over the course of this year. The tiger has stirred. Wearing my MPC hat, and with UK inflation already below target, this is something I am watching like a dove.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A leading energy expert has warned that although the British government is right to proceed with new nuclear plants they risk becoming a \u201cfinancial drain\u201d unless they can be built on time and on budget. Steven Chu, the former US energy secretary and Nobel prizewinning physicist, believes using a variety of reactor designs \u2013 as the UK looks poised to do \u2013 is not the best way to keep costs down. \u201cUnless we can learn to build nuclear on schedule and on budget it will be a financial drain. Other countries have learned how to do this: South Korea has built 10 plants exactly the same and the tenth plant was only 60% of the cost of the original one. The cost came marching down because they just kept doing the same thing,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThat is true of all industries. If you build exactly the same its get cheaper, cheaper, cheaper. Everything different means it will cost more. You have to understand that. When the United States built its nuclear plants they were all different,\u201d argued Chu who was President Obama\u2019s energy secretary until April last year and is now a professor at Stanford University in California. Atomic plants being built in Finland and France are much more expensive than forecast and are suffering significant delays but EDF, the company planning to build Hinkley Point C reactors in Somerset, says it will learn from those mistakes. While EDF plans to use an \u201cEPR\u201d design at Hinkley and possibly at Sizewell in Suffolk, other developers in Britain are planning different models. Chu, who was in Britain giving this year\u2019s Romanes Lecture at Oxford University, believes a key role for nuclear power will be to provide support for other low-carbon, but intermittent, power technologies such as wind and solar, of which he is a supporter. \u201cIn the US, within a decade, onshore wind without subsidy is going to be less expensive than natural gas \u2013 even with natural gas staying at its current price which is two-and-a-half times less expensive than natural gas in the UK. \u201cI think England may be a different story in the sense that you have a lot of good wind resources but it\u2019s a small country, and I know England is looking at another generation of nuclear reactors which I am in favour of: perhaps what we need is one more generation of nuclear reactors.\u201d Chu, whose current work includes research into more powerful and effective batteries, says: \u201cSometimes you will get 100% wind but other times the wind will not be blowing and you do need back-up power and that is going to come from fossil fuel or nuclear. What we will be able to do by mid-century is 50% of electricity from renewables if Europe shares its renewable resources \u2026 We would still need to capture carbon from fossil fuel-generating plants, also from cement and steel (manufacturing) plants.\u201d The Stanford professor is still worried that not enough progress is being made worldwide to tackle climate change but remains upbeat about Obama\u2019s attempts to galvanise the US more, not least through the recent bilateral agreement with China. Would a Republican president in in 2016 represent a setback? \u201cA Republican presidency would not necessarily be a setback. It was a rabid anti-communist [Richard Nixon] who opened up China. That same president started the Environmental Protection Agency which is not considered part of the Republican agenda. Another Republican president [George Bush senior] stopped underground nuclear testing in the United States. He also put a cap and trade system in place on some emissions from power plants. \u201cSome leading Republicans support a carbon tax for instance. You start at $10-$15 per tonne and slowly make it rise to $60 or so. But you use those revenues for the people \u2013 you do not use those revenues for other government programmes. We have means of doing it, through higher social security cheques or helping the unemployed. You give it back to the American people.\u201d Chu dismisses concerns that a price on carbon could damage energy-intensive businesses pointing out that most oil companies now carry a \u201cghost price\u201d for carbon on the books. And he says tougher political action on climate change would bring new solutions itself. \u201cAs long as engineers know what is happening, if countries know that is happening then people will come up with technical solutions. Historically [solutions] arrive.\u201d As for the chance of a binding climate change agreement between countries at next year\u2019s vital talks in Paris he says: \u201cI think there is forward momentum. I hope [Paris] is better than Copenhagen. Do I have significant hope there will be a binding agreement among all countries, probably not. But my guess is that China will put a price on carbon during this government. Central government knows there is a huge risk [from climate change] their country faces. \u201cThat is why they are working hard to diversify their energy supply and are the largest installer of wind and solar in the world as well as building 30-plus nuclear power plants and trying to develop their natural gas resources. So China is moving, major states in the US are moving but \u2026 I get nervous. We are not moving fast enough.",

Would a Republican president in in 2016 represent a setback?</p> <p>\u201cA Republican presidency would not necessarily be a setback. It was a rabid anti-communist [Richard Nixon] who opened up China. That same president started the Environmental Protection Agency which is not considered part of the Republican agenda. Another Republican president [George Bush senior] stopped underground nuclear testing in the United States. He also put a cap and trade system in place on some emissions from power plants.</p> <p>\u201cSome leading Republicans support a carbon tax for instance. You start at $10-$15 per tonne and slowly make it rise to $60 or so. But you use those revenues for the people \u2013 you do not use those revenues for other government programmes. We have means of doing it, through higher social security cheques or helping the unemployed. You give it back to the American people.\u201d</p> <p>Chu dismisses concerns that a price on carbon could damage energy-intensive businesses pointing out that most oil companies now carry a \u201cghost price\u201d for carbon on the books.</p> <p>And he says tougher political action on climate change would bring new solutions itself. \u201cAs long as engineers know what is happening, if countries know that is happening then people will come up with technical solutions. Historically [solutions] arrive.\u201d</p> <p>As for the chance of a binding climate change agreement between countries at next year\u2019s vital talks in Paris he says: \u201cI think there is forward momentum. I hope [Paris] is better than Copenhagen. Do I have significant hope there will be a binding agreement among all countries, probably not. But my guess is that China will put a price on carbon during this government. Central government knows there is a huge risk [from climate change] their country faces.</p> <p>\u201cThat is why they are working hard to diversify their energy supply and are the largest installer of wind and solar in the world as well as building 30-plus nuclear power plants and trying to develop their natural gas resources. So China is moving, major states in the US are moving but \u2026 I get nervous. We are not moving fast enough.</p>",

No longer. Asda\u2019s sales over the most recent three months were down 1.6%. This includes fast-growing online sales \u2013 so the results from its core stores are even worse than that. Its chief executive, Andy Clarke, is preparing to add more ammo to the \u00a31bn of price cuts he has already promised. Sainsbury\u2019s also unveiled a series of price cuts last week \u2013 \u00a3150m worth, which doesn\u2019t feel like anywhere near enough to properly compete on price. The coming six weeks are the most important in the shopping calendar. This year they will also determine the scale of Tesco\u2019s response on price cuts next year. Expect it to be big. That will be good news for shoppers \u2013 but probably very bad news for shareholders.",

      "bodyText": "Moves by G20 nations to tackle corporate tax avoidance are welcome but will only begin to uncover the full problem while leaving poor countries still vulnerable to exploitation, tax justice advocates and anti-poverty campaigners have said. Leaders of the world\u2019s richest nations resolved to finish in 2015 work on modernising international tax rules to address the issue of companies shifting profits and reducing government tax bases. In their communique following the meeting in Brisbane, G20 leaders affirmed the principle that \u201cprofits should be taxed where economic activities deriving the profits are performed and where value is created\u201d. They also welcomed progress on taxing patent boxes, a practice whereby intellectual property royalties can divert profits from the countries where they are made. G20 nations would automatically exchange information flowing from banks to tax authorities on a reciprocal basis and using a global common reporting standard by 2017 or end 2018, the communique said. To address concerns of developing countries, G20 leaders welcomed deeper engagement from them in the \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting\u201d (Beps) project run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \u201cWe will work with them to build their tax administration capacity and implement [automatic exchange of tax information],\u201d they said. \u201cWe welcome further collaboration by our tax authorities on cross-border compliance activities.\u201d However, Bessma Momani, an analyst with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, told an earlier media conference it was too early to see whether an equitable tax system would come to fruition on the basis of the G20 offerings.

Oxfam\u2019s international executive director, Winnie Byanyima, said what was on the table currently was not enough to stop poor countries being \u201cbled dry\u201d. Byanyima called for a worldwide tax summit because most developing countries were still excluded from decision-making on global tax issues. She said it was unfair that the tax haven Luxembourg had a seat at the table while Sierra Leone \u2013 \u201cwhere Ebola is raging and tax incentives for six multinational companies are eight times the health budget\u201d \u2013 did not. A federal opposition MP, Terri Butler, said she hoped the lack of reference to \u201ctax avoidance and aggressive tax planning\u201d, terms that were included at an international meeting last year, was not a result of pressure from large corporations. Only a reference to \u201charmful tax practices\u201d was retained. Butler also said it had been, until recent days, Australia that had been dragging its feet by resisting the adoption of the global common reporting standard for banks to tax authorities.

RBS paid \u00a3400m to the FCA and a US regulator over a failure of internal controls which allowed traders to act together to move currency prices for profit. It was among six banks which were fined \u00a32.6bn by regulators. The scale of the penalty for IT failings will be less but will revive memories of the chaos caused by the IT outage and leave RBS open to allegations of incompetence. Ireland\u2019s central bank last week fined RBS \u00a32.7m for the fiasco, which hit Ulster Bank particularly hard, leaving some customers without banking services for almost a month. Neither RBS nor the FCA would comment on the latest potential fine, but the bank said last month that the regulator had begun \u201cenforcement proceedings\u201d in relation to its investigation, which began in April 2013. In 2012, RBS put aside \u00a3175m to compensate customers and has not quantified the penalty it expects to receive from the FCA.",

      "bodyText": "Marx and Engels proclaimed in 1848 that a spectre was haunting Europe \u2013 the spectre of communism. As it turned out, the spectre did eventually materialise, in the form of Soviet communism, which spread after the second world war to eastern Europe. The Berlin Wall was built 16 years later, in 1961, to put a stop to the way East Germans were voting about communism with their feet. There have been celebrations recently to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the wall in November 1989. That fall was followed in 1991 by the collapse of the Soviet Union itself, a Soviet Union about which President Putin appears to harbour nostalgic feelings. After those events there was an inevitable burst of triumphalism in the west. Some of us feared that, with the disappearance of the communist threat, some of the worst instincts of casino capitalism would be evinced; and so they were. I myself had what I thought was a bright idea of writing a book called The Spectre of Capitalism. I hoped the catchy title would make my fortune \u2013 indeed, make me a capitalist \u2013 but it has to be said that sales fell woefully short of anything written by Marx. Now the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has followed Marx with a declaration last week that \u201ca spectre is now haunting Europe \u2013 the spectre of economic stagnation\u201d. This phrase received about as much attention as that book of mine. It was uttered during the presentation of the monetary policy committee\u2019s quarterly inflation report, and people were much more interested in the outlook for interest rates: the story remains that rates went outside after the financial crash, and will continue to remain outside for some time. But, as the Bank is keen to emphasise, the outlook for the British economy is a lot better than that for Europe in general: it may be the slowest recovery in centuries, but our economy is now on the mend. However, there is a still a long way to go to make up the ground lost after Chancellor Osborne\u2019s woefully misjudged decision to abort the 2010 recovery he inherited with a needlessly deflationary and (literally) counterproductive fiscal policy. Which brings us back to the spectre haunting Europe. Carney was not referring to David Cameron, but it intrigues me that when the prime minister and a legion of others go on about the need for reform in Europe, they are barking up the wrong tree. As Llewellyn Consulting points out in its current bulletin, the universal chant when the subject of the eurozone\u2019s plight comes up is that what is needed is \u201cmore structural reform\u201d. Llewellyn points out that \u201cwhile of paramount importance to productivity and supply-side flexibility over the longer term\u201d, structural reform \u201cfrequently depresses demand in the short term\u201d. Also, \u201creform fatigue is increasingly a fact of life in many economies\u201d. The reform the eurozone needs is in its attitude to macroeconomic policy. Mario Draghi, the admirable president of the European Central Bank, has been crying in vain for a reversal of fiscal policy. There is a limit to what monetary policy, for which the ECB is responsible, can achieve when fiscal policy is pulling in the other direction. The approach to macroeconomic policy in Brussels is dominated by Germany. The problem is that the Germans are urging further cuts on economies that are rapidly nearing the end of their tether. One close observer of policymaking in Germany says, only half jokingly, that advice is dominated by a combination of \u201cthose who don\u2019t understand Keynes and those who do but are too scared to admit it\u201d. The Tories, who may yet save the beleaguered Ed Miliband by tearing themselves apart over Europe, would be well advised to heed the words of one George Soros, who has pointed out that by being members of the European Union but not of the eurozone, we in Britain enjoy \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d. The Bank of England pointed out in the inflation report that \u201cthe potential positive impact of ECB policy actions\u201d is likely to be outweighed in the near term by the factors that are already depressing growth in the euro area. Carney, who has not hesitated on occasion to acknowledge that Osborne\u2019s fiscal policy impeded the British recovery, manifested some sympathy with Draghi\u2019s view that there needs to be a relaxation of fiscal policy. This means at the very least going easy on budget cuts, but ideally adopting a major expansionary policy involving much-needed infrastructure projects. Indeed, even Germany itself is crying out for renewal of its infrastructure. For \u201cstructural reform\u201d read \u201cinfrastructure reform\u201d! This does not seem to be understood in Berlin \u2013 or, for that matter, in Brussels. They go on relentlessly about the need to honour the EU\u2019s \u201cstability and growth pact\u201d, with its strict targets for budgets and debt. But that pact was drawn up in what were reasonably normal times. The financial crisis changed everything. I always thought it significant that the word \u201cstability\u201d came before \u201cgrowth\u201d when the pact was signed. The problem now is that there is precious little growth, even in Germany itself, and the danger is that stability may soon turn into deflationary instability. Hence Carney\u2019s warning about the spectre haunting Europe.",

This argument cuts little ice with those who are frustrated by the fact that no bankers have been put behind bars for their role in the financial crisis. Roger McCormick, managing director of the CCP Research Foundation and a former visiting professor at the London School of Economics, pointed out that criminal investigations were under way. Some 13 individuals face charges linked to Libor rigging. The SFO\u2019s investigation into the foreign exchange markets is in the early stages; and Chancellor George Osborne on Friday promised resources for action by the Serious Fraud Office. McCormick, whose organisation keeps a running tally of the \u201cconduct costs\u201d of banks, said fines did matter, in part because of their shaming effect. But he thinks they work best in tandem with other methods of cleaning up City behaviour and wants to set up forums for top bankers to discuss the \u201cgrey areas\u201d involved their in day-to-day business. But former City minister Lord Myners insisted that fines did not work and that senior bank executives should be forced to take responsibility. He said: \u201cThe only thing which will affect behaviour will be an absolute insistence from the top of the banks that behaviour must be exemplary and a zero tolerance of anything which falls short.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that the odour of what was going on did not reach the noses of those at the top.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Only 50 years ago, St Paul\u2019s was still London\u2019s tallest building: the capital\u2019s skyline has become so overwhelmed with glass and steel towers since then that it\u2019s easy to forget. In the last couple of years, the Shard on the south bank, western Europe\u2019s tallest building, has been followed by the Cheesegrater and the Walkie Talkie in the City. Height matters. British Land insists its Cheesegrater is the tallest building in the City \u2013 but Gerald Ronson\u2019s Heron Tower is actually taller, thanks to its 28m mast. Many of these buildings have been dogged by financial problems or design glitches. The Cheesegrater and the Walkie Talkie were both put on hold during the recession when the market for odffice space ground to a halt, and work on the Pinnacle was halted two years ago. The Walkie Talkie\u2019s south facade was found to have scorching powers, while the Shard has taken transparency too far (see below). Most skyscrapers were controversial at first, for their design or for blocking treasured views of an older London landmark such as St Paul\u2019s. The Gherkin illustrated how skyscrapers tend to be filled with tenants: just like their construction, it is often from the ground up, with the top floors commanding the highest rents. But, as seen in recent deals for the Gherkin and HSBC\u2019s tower in Canary Wharf, the buildings still change hands for sky-high sums. 1 The Gherkin One of London\u2019s most recognisable silhouettes, the 180m Gherkin was last week bought by Brazilian banker Joseph Safra in a deal thought to be worth more than \u00a3700m. Officially called 30 St Mary Axe, the Foster and Partners-designed tower tower, designed by Ken Shuttleworth at Foster + Partners,was put up for sale \u2013 for the second time in its 10-year history \u2013 in the summer with a guide price of \u00a3650m after its previous owners, private equity firm Evans Randall and German property investor IVG, defaulted on a loan. They had bought it for \u00a3600m in 2007 from reinsurer Swiss Re, which commissioned it in 2004. It was the first tall structure built in the Square Mile since the 1970s. What you may not know It was built on the site of the old Baltic exchange bombed by the IRA. 2 HSBC tower One Canada Square\u2019s more prosaic neighbour, HSBC\u2019s global headquarters at 8 Canada Square was acquired last month by Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund for more than \u00a31.1bn. The 45-storey tower\u2019s previous owner was South Korea\u2019s national pensions service, which acquired it for nearly \u00a3800m from HSBC in 2009 in a year of low property prices. The bank, whose lease runs until 2027, had sold it in 2007 to Spanish property company Metrovacesa for \u00a31.09bn, but took it back a year later when Metrovacesa ran into financial trouble. HSBC staff moved into the 210m tower, also designed by Foster + Partners, in 2002 and it now houses 8,000 people. What you may not know Last month\u2019s sale to the Qataris made it the UK\u2019s most expensive office building. 3 Canary Wharf tower When One Canada Square became the first tower to rise out of the docks of east London in 1990, it was surrounded by controversy. At 244m, it was the tallest building in the UK for two decades until it was overtaken by the Shard in 2010. Architecture critics thought it was too big. Margaret Thatcher was not impressed and Prince Charles told its architect, C\u00e9sar Pelli: \u201cI personally would go mad if I had to work in a place like that.\u2019\u2019 The developer, Paul Reichmann\u2019s property firm Olympia &amp; York, collapsed into administration in 1992 during the recession, losing him much of his fortune. In that year, security was scaled up after an IRA bomb was placed near the tower, although it failed to go off (another did go off at nearby South Quay four years later). The 50-floor steel-clad obelisk is more than 90% occupied, by housing owner Canary Wharf Group and parent Songbird, along with firms including HSBC, HS2 and the European Banking Authority. What you may not know It is rapper Dizzee Rascal\u2019s favourite: \u201cIt means the most to me, I could see it from all angles as a kid. That was the highest building I could see from my bedroom.\u201d 4 Heron tower The 230m skyscraper, currently the tallest building in the City, opened in March 2011 with just two tenants \u2013 the US law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery and Landmark, a serviced office company. Like other developers, property tycoon Gerald Ronson (who pioneered self-service petrol stations in the UK in the 1960s) struggled to fill all the space. It is now more than 90% let, with 3,000 people working in the building, but it almost fell into receivership last year when a consortium of banks led by Wells Fargo called in a \u00a3300m construction loan. After wrangling between Ronson\u2019s Heron International and his backers \u2013 the State General Reserve of Oman and Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd of Saudi Arabia \u2013 the three investors stumped up enough money to secure a refinancing. The building, located near Liverpool Street station, was previously rescued by then deputy prime minister John Prescott, who overruled a warning from the government\u2019s conservation agency English Heritage that the tower would spoil the protected views of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. There was another row in May when its owners renamed it Salesforce tower after the largest tenant, the US software firm Salesforce.com. However, they were overruled by the City of London after other tenants also complained, so the building is officially called 110 Bishopsgate. It was designed by New York architects Kohn Pedersen Fox and features fully glazed double-decker lifts along with restaurants at the top and bottom. What you may not know The lobby features a 70,000-litre aquarium with 1,200 fish. Sharks have been removed because, Heron International says, they were getting bitten in their sleep by the other fish. 5 Tower 42 Architect Richard Seifert\u2019s brash, steel-lined tower opened in 1979, the first of a rash of tall buildings in the City. Originally called the NatWest Tower, built to house National Westminster Bank\u2019s international division, for many years it was Britain\u2019s only real skyscraper. At 183m, with 47 floors, it was the highest building in the UK until it was surpassed by the Canary Wharf Tower in 1990. Its features include double-decker lifts and sky lobbies on levels 23 and 24, which were both new to the UK at the time. The tower was refurbished and sold by NatWest after being badly damaged by an IRA bomb in 1993. It ended up being acquired by Hermes Real Estate and BlackRock\u2019s UK property arm for \u00a3226m in 1998. In 2010, they put the tower on the market for \u00a3300m, but had to settle for \u00a3282.5m when they sold it to the South African billionaire Nathan Kirsh the following year. Tower 42 featured in the BBC\u2019s Sherlock TV series, as Shad Shanderson, the financial institution used in the Blind Banker episode. What you may not know You can sample the view from the upper levels of Tower 42 by appointment \u2013 by booking a table at the Vertigo champagne bar on the 42nd floor. 6 Shell Centre Plans to revamp the 1960s Shell Centre near Waterloo on the south bank, close to the London Eye, were recently approved by communities secretary Eric Pickles. He overrode heritage concerns over the \u00a31bn complex of offices, luxury apartments and shops, but a legal challenge against his decision was launched by activist and writer George Turner. The developers, Canary Wharf Group and Qatari Diar, the Gulf state\u2019s property investment vehicle, are awaiting a high court ruling next month. The 27-storey tower that houses oil company Royal Dutch Shell will live on while other parts of the complex are knocked down to make way for eight new buildings, including a 37-storey block of luxury flats. The Guardian\u2019s Simon Jenkins has lambasted the scheme as a \u201cvisual wall of towers on a truly Stalinist scale\u201d. Designed by Sir Howard Robertson for the bomb-damaged site levelled for the 1951 Festival of Britain, the Shell Centre tower will remain the centrepiece of the complex while its low-rise wings will be demolished. Some of the 1,600 Shell staff will have to relocate temporarily to Canary Wharf and the Shell Mex building in the Strand, but once the complex is finished all 4,000 London staff are expected to move to the site. It could take up to six years. What you may not know Sir Howard Robertson\u2019s design team based the tower, Europe\u2019s first major air-conditioned block, on the Rockefeller Centre. 7 Walkie Talkie The first tenant, insurer RSA, moved in in May even though the 37-storey skyscraper, designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly at 20 Fenchurch Street, is not quite finished. Its Sky Garden will open to the public in January, including a landscaped garden, terrace, bar and restaurant. It took the developers, Land Securities and Canary Wharf Group, some time to fix problems created by its concave, light-reflecting south-facing facade. Acting like a giant magnifying glass, the curved building melted parts of a car parked below it last year and was also blamed by nearby businesses for scorching carpets and cracking tiles. Staff have now covered its glass wall with non-reflective film called brise-soleil. Up to 6,000 are expected to work in the building. What you may not know The \u201cWalkie Scorchie\u201d is not the first Vi\u00f1oly building to raise temperatures \u2013 his Vdara hotel in Las Vegas, which also sports a concave glass facade, has melted sun loungers and singed newspapers. 8 Cheesegrater British Land\u2019s recently completed new Leadenhall Building, nicknamed Cheesegrater for its wedge shape, made headlines last week when two steel bolts fell off it, with parts falling to the ground. An area is still cordoned off at the base of the tower while tests are being carried out. The 47-storey, 224m skyscraper, designed by Graham Stirk of Rogers Stirk Harbour and partners \u2013 is still empty, with the first tenants due to move in early next year. Insurance broker Aon will be the main tenant, with insurers Amlin and Rothesay Life and Australian serviced-office provider Servcorp also taking space. This means just over half the office space has been let so far. Up to 6,000 people will be working in the tower eventually. It set a new record for office rents in the City recently when US insurance firm FM Global took the 41st floor at \u00a385 per sq ft. This eclipsed the previous record of \u00a380 per sq ft set earlier in the year at the Shard on the south bank of the Thames. What you may not know It got its nickname from Peter Rees, then the City\u2019s chief planning officer. \u201cWhen I first saw a model of the building, I told [architect] Richard Rogers I could imagine his wife, Ruthie, using it to grate parmesan. I don\u2019t think he was too happy, but it stuck.\u201d 9 The Shard Soaring to 310m, with 95 storeys, Irvine Sellar\u2019s Shard was intended to be the tallest building in Europe, but was beaten to the title by Moscow\u2019s 339m Mercury City Tower (the Shard is still the tallest building in the EU). The property entrepreneur and the tower\u2019s Italian architect, Renzo Piano, managed to overcome scepticism that the building opposite the City across the Thames, would cast a huge shadow over St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Piano insisted that \u201cwhen together, the two buildings will kiss each other\u201d. Financial backers Credit Suisse First Boston pulled out in 2007 with the banking crisis looming and were replaced by the state of Qatar, which bankrolled the \u00a31.5bn project, including the 17-storey \u201cbaby Shard\u201d next door. None of the office space had been sold by its completion in 2012 (Transport of London pulled out, leaving the five-star Shangri-La Hotel as the only business customer to have signed up). Only two-thirds of the building has been filled, with 4,000 people working there. The Shangri-La hotel occupies 18 floors including the highest infinity swimming pool in Europe and other tenants include Al-Jazeera and Warwick University Business School. In a spectacular moment, the Shard was struck by lightning in May 2014. The 10 luxury apartments near the top, with price tags of \u00a330m to \u00a350m each, haven\u2019t been put on the market yet. What you may not know Because of a design glitch, it emerged that some hotel guests can see into other rooms if blinds are open. 10 Pinnacle The planned 288m, 63-storey tower on Bishopsgate in the City is also known as the Helter-Skelter for its twisty design at the top. Humiliatingly, it also became known as \u201cthe stump\u201d after construction (which had begun in 2008) came to an abrupt halt in 2012 when funding dried up, leaving a seven-storey shell. The plan was to finish the tower this year. Some \u00a3400m has already been spent out of a total estimated cost of \u00a31bn. Its owners, Arab Investments and the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund Sedco, are thought to be close to selling the scheme for \u00a3220m to a group of investors led by pension firm Axa\u2019s property arm. Assuming a deal is struck, it will still take until 2018 or even 2020 until the tower is finished. The design is now likely to undergo radical changes to save money. Karen Cook and other architects at US firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates have left and set up their own firm, PLP, to work on new plans. It could be another year until construction resumes, as a fresh planning application will have to be submitted. But the expensive \u201chelter skelter\u201d curved glass panels at the top could still be scrapped. What you may not know Under the original plan, the Pinnacle would have been the tallest building in the Square Mile and almost as high as the Shard.",

In 2010, they put the tower on the market for \u00a3300m, but had to settle for \u00a3282.5m when they sold it to the South African billionaire Nathan Kirsh the following year.</p> <p>Tower 42 featured in the BBC\u2019s Sherlock TV series, as Shad Shanderson, the financial institution used in the Blind Banker episode.</p> <p><strong>What you may not know</strong> You can sample the view from the upper levels of Tower 42 by appointment \u2013 by booking a table at the Vertigo champagne bar on the 42nd floor.</p> <h2>6 <strong>Shell Centre</strong></h2> <p>Plans to revamp the 1960s Shell Centre near Waterloo on the south bank, close to the London Eye, were recently approved by communities secretary Eric Pickles. He overrode heritage concerns over the \u00a31bn complex of offices, luxury apartments and shops, but a legal challenge against his decision was launched by activist and writer George Turner. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/28/shell-centre-site-facelift\">The developers, Canary Wharf Group and Qatari Diar, the Gulf state\u2019s property investment vehicle</a>, are awaiting a high court ruling next month. The 27-storey tower that houses oil company Royal Dutch Shell will live on while other parts of the complex are knocked down to make way for eight new buildings, including a 37-storey block of luxury flats. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/11/gulf-on-thames-scar-london-southbank-boris\">The Guardian\u2019s Simon Jenkins has lambasted the scheme</a> as a \u201cvisual wall of towers on a truly Stalinist scale\u201d. Designed by Sir Howard Robertson for the bomb-damaged site levelled for the 1951 Festival of Britain, the Shell Centre tower will remain the centrepiece of the complex while its low-rise wings will be demolished. Some of the 1,600 Shell staff will have to relocate temporarily to Canary Wharf and the Shell Mex building in the Strand, but once the complex is finished all 4,000 London staff are expected to move to the site. It could take up to six years.</p> <p><strong>What you may not know</strong> Sir Howard Robertson\u2019s design team based the tower, Europe\u2019s first major air-conditioned block, on the Rockefeller Centre.</p> <h2>7<strong> Walkie Talkie</strong></h2> <p>The first tenant, insurer RSA, moved in in May even though the 37-storey skyscraper, designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly at 20 Fenchurch Street, is not quite finished. Its <a href=\"http://www.20fenchurchstreet.co.uk/sky-garden.html\">Sky Garden </a> will open to the public in January, including a landscaped garden, terrace, bar and restaurant. It took the developers, Land Securities and Canary Wharf Group, some time to fix problems created by its concave, light-reflecting south-facing facade. Acting like a giant magnifying glass, the curved building melted parts of a car parked below it last year and was also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/04/walkie-talkie-screen-death-ray\">blamed by nearby businesses for scorching carpets and cracking tiles</a>. Staff have now covered its glass wall with non-reflective film called brise-soleil. Up to 6,000 are expected to work in the building.</p> <p><strong>What you may not know</strong> The \u201cWalkie Scorchie\u201d is not the first Vi\u00f1oly building to raise temperatures \u2013 his Vdara hotel in Las Vegas, which also sports a concave glass facade, has melted sun loungers and singed newspapers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"14a4ae12483cb5eefc3e10a317a1995b5ebbc051\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/14/1415989904452/d9dc2db0-f1db-498b-8c15-03bf88bd7ca6-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Leadenhall building in London\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>8 <strong>Cheesegrater</strong></h2> <p>British Land\u2019s recently completed new Leadenhall Building, nicknamed Cheesegrater for its wedge shape, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/cheesegrater-steel-bolts-fall-from-building\">made headlines last week when two steel bolts fell off it</a>, with parts falling to the ground. An area is still cordoned off at the base of the tower while tests are being carried out. The 47-storey, 224m skyscraper, designed by Graham Stirk of Rogers Stirk Harbour and partners \u2013 is still empty, with the first tenants due to move in early next year. Insurance broker Aon will be the main tenant, with insurers Amlin and Rothesay Life and Australian serviced-office provider Servcorp also taking space. This means just over half the office space has been let so far. Up to 6,000 people will be working in the tower eventually. It set a new record for office rents in the City recently when US insurance firm FM Global took the 41st floor at \u00a385 per sq ft. This eclipsed the previous record of \u00a380 per sq ft set earlier in the year at the Shard on the south bank of the Thames.</p> <p><strong>What you may not know </strong>It got its nickname from Peter Rees, then the City\u2019s chief planning officer. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/16/cheesegrater-leadenhall-building-richard-rogers\">When I first saw a model of the building, I told [architect] Richard Rogers I could imagine his wife, Ruthie, using it to grate parmesan. I don\u2019t think he was too happy, but it stuck.\u201d</a></p> <h2>9<strong> The Shard</strong></h2> <p>Soaring to 310m, with 95 storeys, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/interactive/2013/feb/01/view-from-top-shard-london-interactive\"> Irvine Sellar\u2019s Shard</a> was intended to be the tallest building in Europe, but was beaten to the title by<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2012/nov/05/mercury-city-tower-the-shard\"> Moscow\u2019s 339m Mercury City Tower</a> (the Shard is still the tallest building in the EU). The property entrepreneur and the tower\u2019s Italian architect, Renzo Piano, managed to overcome scepticism that the building opposite the City across the Thames, would cast a huge shadow over St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Piano insisted that \u201cwhen together, the two buildings will kiss each other\u201d.</p> <p>Financial backers Credit Suisse First Boston pulled out in 2007 with the banking crisis looming and were replaced by the state of Qatar, which bankrolled the \u00a31.5bn project, including the 17-storey \u201cbaby Shard\u201d next door. None of the office space had been sold by its completion in 2012 (Transport of London pulled out, leaving the five-star Shangri-La Hotel as the only business customer to have signed up). Only two-thirds of the building has been filled, with 4,000 people working there. The Shangri-La hotel occupies 18 floors including the highest infinity swimming pool in Europe and other tenants include Al-Jazeera and Warwick University Business School.</p> <p>In a spectacular moment, the Shard was struck by lightning in May 2014. The 10 luxury apartments near the top, with price tags of \u00a330m to \u00a350m each, haven\u2019t been put on the market yet.</p> <p><strong>What you may not know </strong>Because of a design glitch, it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/09/shard-shangri-la-guests-see-into-others-hotel-rooms\">some hotel guests can see into other rooms</a> if blinds are open.</p> <h2>10 <strong>Pinnacle</strong></h2> <p>The planned 288m, 63-storey tower on Bishopsgate in the City is also known as the Helter-Skelter for its twisty design at the top. Humiliatingly, it also became known as \u201cthe stump\u201d after construction (which had begun in 2008) came to an abrupt halt in 2012 when funding dried up, leaving a seven-storey shell. The plan was to finish the tower this year. Some \u00a3400m has already been spent out of a total estimated cost of \u00a31bn.</p> <p>Its owners, Arab Investments and the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund Sedco, are thought to be close to selling the scheme for \u00a3220m to a group of investors led by pension firm Axa\u2019s property arm. Assuming a deal is struck, it will still take until 2018 or even 2020 until the tower is finished. The design is now likely to undergo radical changes to save money. Karen Cook and other architects at US firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates have left and set up their own firm, PLP, to work on new plans. It could be another year until construction resumes, as a fresh planning application will have to be submitted. But the expensive \u201chelter skelter\u201d curved glass panels at the top could still be scrapped.</p> <p><strong>What you may not know</strong> Under the original plan, the Pinnacle would have been the tallest building in the Square Mile and almost as high as the Shard.</p>",
