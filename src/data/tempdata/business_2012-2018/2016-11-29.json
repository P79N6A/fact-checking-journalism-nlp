      "bodyText": "New cars imported from the European Union could rise in price by \u00a31,500 if the UK leaves the single market, according to a warning by the industry\u2019s lobby group. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said failure by the government to retain access to the single market after Brexit could cost the industry and consumers \u00a34.5bn a year in export and import tariffs. Urging the government to \u201cmake the right decisions\u201d and secure access to the single market, the SMMT said EU tariffs of 10% on cars could add at least \u00a32.7bn to import costs and \u00a31.8bn to exports. \u201cImport tariffs alone could push up the list price of cars imported to the UK from the continent by an average of \u00a31,500 if brands and their retail networks were unable to absorb these additional costs,\u201d it added. Based on the average price of a new car sold in the UK of \u00a323,029, it would amount to a 6.5% rise. The average UK-built car has about 6,000 parts, the majority of which come from the EU. The SMMT backed the remain camp in the run-up to the EU referendum, and is now campaigning on behalf of its members to stay within the single market. Addressing industry leaders and government officials at its 100th annual dinner in London, the SMMT\u2019s president, Gareth Jones, said: \u201cWe must make the right decisions on trade, on regulation and on business competitiveness. [The industry wants] membership of the single market, consistency in regulations, access to global talent and global markets, and the ability to trade abroad free from barriers and red tape.\u201d Britain\u2019s car industry has enjoyed a period of strength over recent years, as cheap finance deals and more efficient models attract consumers. New car sales are on course for a fifth consecutive year of growth in 2016, and 2015 marked a 10-year high for car manufacturing. Jones said: \u201cThe renaissance is down to years of hard work, hard won investment and long-term collaborative partnership between industry and government. We operate in an intensely competitive environment. We need to create the right conditions for future competitiveness.\u201d The SMMT warned earlier this month that British car manufacturing was at risk of \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d if companies invested in other countries rather than the UK after the Brexit vote. The dinner coincided with a new report by the SMMT and KPMG which said progress in digital manufacturing could add \u00a36.9bn to the UK car industry\u2019s annual turnover. The report claimed new technologies such as 3D printing and more effective use of data could contribute \u00a374bn to the wider UK economy over the next two decades, as well as cutting the time consumers have to wait for a new car by a third. John Leech, head of automotive for KPMG in the UK, said: \u201cThe UK automotive industry is already the most productive in Europe but faces increasing competition from lower cost countries and uncertainty following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. \u201cThe application of digital technologies to the design and manufacture of vehicles will help to secure the industry\u2019s competitiveness in the decades to come.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A decrease in penalty rates would boost major retailers\u2019 profits or result in tiny reductions in consumer prices without changing employment levels, an independent financial analysis suggests. The analysis has been seized on by opponents of penalty rate cuts who say it shows shareholders, not workers, would benefit from any cut. According to Citi Research, a division of Citigroup, cutting Sunday penalty rates from double-time to time-and-a-half would increase earnings per share by up to 8% for both Myer and JB Hi-Fi and 5% for Wesfarmers, if retailers retained the benefits. Citi made the estimate in a confidential financial analysis of the penalty rate issue for institutional investors in retail shares, seen by Guardian Australia. The analysis, dated 23 November, said retailers would either \u201cretain all the benefits for their shareholders\u201d or pass on the benefits of lower penalty rates to consumers, depending on the level of competition in their industry. But the saving \u201cwill be negligible at less than 1%\u201d, it said, estimating reduced wages could result in cost savings of just 0.1% to 0.4%. The analysis makes no mention of the effect of a penalty rate cut on employment levels, suggesting Citi does not anticipate retailers would hire more workers or increase shifts. Tim Lyons, a research fellow at the Per Capita think tank and former Australian Council of Trade Unions assistant secretary, said the Citi analysis \u201cdestroys the dishonest employer and Turnbull government case for lower penalty rates\u201d. \u201cIt confirms that cutting penalty rates will not create more jobs but result in increased profits.\u201d Employer groups have asked for Sunday penalty rates to be cut from 100% to 50% in a Fair Work Commission (FWC) review of awards including the general retail award, the result for which is expected soon. In its submissions the Australian Industry Group argued that employers consider penalty rates in rostering Sunday shifts and they would offer more or longer weekend shifts if the rates were reduced. It based the submission on evidence to the commission from smaller retailers. The Australian Retail Association noted it was difficult to demonstrate the effect of cutting penalty rates but evidence from experts, surveys and retailers suggested penalty rates decreased trading hours and therefore employment. The Turnbull government\u2019s policy is to leave the commission to determine penalty rates, but a number of MPs including Angus Taylor and Ian MacDonald have called for penalty rate cuts to tackle unemployment. They have received encouragement from the Productivity Commission review of workplace laws completed in December which recommended Sunday penalty rates be cut to Saturday levels in the hospitality, retail and entertainment industries. Lyons said the Citi analysis was \u201cwork by people paid to advise on what the financial effects of a penalty rate cut are\u201d. \u201cThis is a merchant bank confirming ... the big dollars involved in cuts to penalty rates will end up on the hands of shareholders. \u201cThe penalty rate debate has been an enormous attempted con job. It\u2019s about lower wages and higher profits, not more jobs.\u201d The Citi document noted that most major retailers including Big W, Bunnings, Just Group, Kmart, Target and Myer had expired enterprise agreements. It suggested they might be waiting in \u201chope that wage reform will be implemented, lowering penalty rates\u201d. Lyons said the analysis also \u201cdestroys a number of myths\u201d, because it showed Australian retailers had higher productivity than key overseas comparison countries. The Citi analysis stated that while Australia had higher wage rates, \u201cproductivity is also higher than offshore peers\u201d. For example, Australian supermarkets have 10%-30% more sales per employee than their UK peers.",

For example, Australian supermarkets have 10%-30% more sales per employee than their UK peers.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May promised radicalism on executive pay and boardroom governance but her government\u2019s green paper is not that. Most of the proposals represent tweaks to the current setup. The corporate lobby, one suspects, will breathe a sigh of relief. The pay of the average FTSE 100 chief executive has increased from 47 times that of the average worker in 1998 to 128 times last year. On the basis of this document, it would be hard to conclude that the gap is about to close. The prime minister had already performed linguistic gymnastics to recast her promise to introduce workers\u2019 representatives on boards; it turned out that her idea didn\u2019t involve actual workers on actual boards, just mechanisms for their \u201cvoices\u201d to be heard. It now appears that even her plan to give shareholders an annual binding vote on boardroom pay could be destined for reinterpretation. The green paper says binding votes could apply to all companies or only to those that have \u201cencountered significant shareholder opposition\u201d to the remuneration report. The latter idea would seem to continue to allow BP to pay its chief executive \u00a314m despite the opposition of 60% of its shareholders, as it did this year. The only sanction would be that the company would find it harder to pull the same trick twice. Prospects look brighter for pay ratios in the sense that the \u201cpro\u201d arguments received more space than the \u201ccons\u201d. And large private companies will be brought into parts of the governance fold, a reform that looks entirely sensible given what we\u2019ve learned about BHS and Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia in recent months. But Iain Wright, the chair of the business select committee, which did such a good job on BHS, is correct when he says the list of tentative options suggests a government \u201cwhose resolve may have weakened on getting to grips with corporate governance\u201d. If one digs deep, some big ideas are acknowledged, it should be said. One of the best has come from the Tory MP Chris Philp, with the backing of the governance old-hand Lord Myners and the lauded fund manager Neil Woodford: Scandinavian-style shareholder committees that would, in effect, replace nominations committees and recommend the appointment and removal of directors. The beauty of this proposal is that it would oblige shareholders to become more active in setting pay, listening to outside voices and questioning strategy \u2013 in short, participating in what is done in their clients\u2019 name. It is one way to crack the problem of \u201cownerless corporations\u201d \u2013 the single biggest impediment to reform. Unfortunately, while Philp\u2019s idea was included, the mention was brief and heavily qualified. Instead, the government seems inclined to embrace \u201cstakeholder advisory panels\u201d, which are fine as far they go but are ultimately powerless. May should rethink. Or, rather, she should remember her own criticism in the summer of the insufficient scrutiny provided by non-executive directors \u201cdrawn from the same, narrow social and professional circles as the executive team\u201d. Her point was excellent because it identified why most governance reforms have disappointed in the past 20 years: the same people have been left in charge of the decision-making. Few of the proposals in this green paper address that central problem. May needs to recapture her summer zeal. EU to the rescue of Ofcom? Prepare the Brussels battalions. If BT won\u2019t separate legally its Openreach subsidiary to the satisfaction of its regulator, it must be made to comply, which \u2013 for a little while yet \u2013 means summoning the European commission. Actually, it probably won\u2019t come to that. BT will surely fall into line with Ofcom\u2019s wishes quickly because it has no other choice. The telecoms regulator proposed legal separation of the Openreach subsidiary, the bit that manages most of the UK\u2019s broadband infrastructure, in July to address competition concerns. Now it is a question of making it happen. The main sticking point concerns the requirement for Openreach to have an independent board with a chief executive who reports only to Openreach\u2019s chairman. Ofcom thinks BT\u2019s current proposal leaves too many reporting lines open to the BT chief executive, Gavin Patterson. The problem does not sound fundamental. Legal separation of Openreach, under BT\u2019s continued ownership, is an untested structure that may prove clunky in practice. But it is the one Ofcom has settled upon and it avoids the costs and hassle of a full breakup. It\u2019s worth trying. BT should avoid the appearance of foot-dragging and get a move on.",

    "webTitle": "US growth revised up; Iran rules out oil production cuts \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "OK, time for a brisk recap. 1) America\u2019s economy is performing even better than expected; growth in the last quarter has been revised up to a 3.2% annual rate, from 2.9%. Consumer spending, investment and exports all helped to push GDP up. Analysts say the figures show the US is in fairly robust shape, making a December interest rate rise even more likely. 2) There\u2019s deadlock in Vienna tonight, as Opec ministers struggle to make headway towards a deal to cut production. Iran has thrown down the gauntlet, saying it will not reduce its output and suggesting Saudi Arabia takes the hit itself. The oil price has slumped by 3.5% tonight, as the markets prepare for tomorrow\u2019s Opec meeting. 3) Investors are bracing for volatility as Italy heads to the polls on Sunday to vote on PM Matteo Renzi\u2019s constitutional reforms. ECB sources have hinted that they would use their QE programme to stabilise the markets on Monday, if the public vote No -- a move that could prompt Renzi\u2019s resignation. Adam Chester, head of economics for commercial banking at Lloyds Bank, predicts turbulence if Renzi loses (as seems likely): Italy is being asked whether to accept a broad package of measures aimed at making the country\u2019s gridlocked political system more efficient and its government more stable. It has had more than 60 governments since the Second World War, so one might think that measures to improve stability would be strongly welcomed. But a key implication of the proposed changes is that incumbents would have far more power, which is strongly resisted by opposition parties, and there is a clear risk that the people will vote against the government, particularly given the weakness of Italy\u2019s economy. If the referendum is not passed \u2013 and the polls suggest a \u2018No\u2019 win \u2013 Prime Minister Renzi could step down, leading to early elections and boosting the anti-EU Five Star Movement (M5S), which has pledged a referendum on whether Italy should stay in the euro. If Italy votes \u2018No\u2019, the euro is likely to come under immediate downward pressure and contagion could also see government bond and credit spreads across much of Europe rise. 4) Companies have been teaming up with charities for Giving Tuesday: That\u2019s probably all for today. Tomorrow will be extra-busy, with Bank of England stress test results released at 7am GMT, and Opec\u2019s meeting running through the day. See you then. Goodnight! GW Italy\u2019s stock market has defied worries about Sunday\u2019s referendum to close 2% higher. The FTSE MIB index outperformed the rest of Europe, helped by that Reuters report that the ECB would step in to stabilise the markets next week, if needed. The German, French, and Spanish indices also finished the day higher, But the FTSE 100 lost 27 point, or 0.4%, to finish at 6772 - dragged down by energy companies including BP (-2.1%) and Shell (-2%). City traders haven\u2019t been impressed by the lack of progress at Opec\u2019s meeting in Vienna today: Joshua Mahoney of IG says: Despite an initial consensus, a deal feels as far away as ever, with members continuing to conduct an intricate game of political poker, utilising the media to further their cause. It is becoming increasingly evident that some of the more prominent OPEC members care more about holding on to market share than helping raise the price of oil. Hence despite agreeing to a production cut, we have seen the likes of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran all continue to raise production. In another signal that America\u2019s economy is solid, sales of recreational vehicles are on track to hit their highest level in four decades. Shipments of new RVs are expected to hit 419,500 this year, industry figures say, up 12% on last year. These whopping motorhomes and trailers are, apparently, popular with Millennials who want to get into the Great Outdoors in some comfort. But....these things don\u2019t come cheap. A typical RV will cost six-figures,. You could even splash out one million dollars if, say, you want large beds, flat screen TVs and space for your own sports car.... Meanwhile in Greece... Athens has received an unexpected boost ahead of next week\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers (the eurogroup). Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. The Dutch finance minister and eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has not always batted for Greece but today he came out firmly in favour of Athens\u2019 longstanding argument that primary surplus targets set by international creditors in the years ahead are simply unachievable. Addressing the European Parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee, the Dutchman suggested it would be counter-productive if Greece was given unrealistic fiscal targets once its current bailout program expires in 2018. \u201cWe need to be realistic\u201d he said adding that it would be a big ask if Athens was made to pull off the herculean task of achieving a 3.5% primary surplus when its fiscal adjustment program was finally completed. Djisselbloem\u2019s comments come in the wake of similar optimism expressed by visiting European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici. Conducting a two-day visit to Athens ahead of next week\u2019s euro group, the Frenchman also voiced support for the leftist-led government\u2019s bid to secure debt relief saying reprofiling of the unustainable load should also begin by year\u2019s end. At over \u20ac300bn, or 180% of GDP, Greece\u2019s debt burden is the biggest in Europe and widely viewed as the root of its financial woes. But demands for more austerity still loom large and could threaten to overturn economic progress in the months ahead. Back in Vienna, the UAE\u2019s oil minister has told energy reporters that Opec could still achieve a deal to cut output tomorrow. Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei said it was premature to assume that the cartel would fail, despite the clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran behind the scenes. Amena Bakr of Energy Intelligence has the details (again): After the excesses of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, British business has been showing its charitable side today. For the third year running, voluntary bodies have been working with companies to encourage people to give money, or time, to good causes - from cancer charities to Syrian aid. Some 1,500 UK-based businesses and charities are taking part this year, including BT - which hosted an event at its iconic Tower this morning - Royal Mail, Royal Bank of Scotland, and several retailers including Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, and the Co-op. The idea started in the 2012 in America, and last year, it raised over $45m worldwide. The Charities Aid Foundation is co-ordinating it in the UK. They\u2019ve sent some details over: A choir of MPs singing Christmas carols on College Green to raise money to support the work of doctors in Aleppo, as part of the Singing for Syrians appeal. MPs taking part included Victoria Prentis, Will Quince, Robert Buckland, Andrea Jenkyns and Eilidh Whiteford. Pictures are available on request.

CAF\u2019s Hannah Terrey has written about it for us here: And there\u2019s a new-fangled Twitter Moment too.... An Opec source has now told Reuters that Iran want Saudi Arabia to cut its output to 9.5m barrels per day, from around 10.5m today. That means Saudi would be taking the entire one million barrel per day cut which was provisionally agreed in September in Algeria. That may be unacceptable to Riyadh -- both economically and politically.... The Opec situation in a brisk nutshell: These latest comments out of Vienna show that Iraq and Iran are at odds with Saudi Arabia over the proposed Opec output cut. The hardline stance from Iran\u2019s Zangenah shows that Tehran is not willing to curb its own output. The situation is complicated; there\u2019s no real agreement on how much Iran is actually pumping today! So Saudi Arabia are effectively being challenged to swallow the output cut themselves, while other cartel members would simply benefit from the resulting higher prices. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 latest dispatch from the Opec HQ: OPEC sources told Reuters a meeting of experts in Vienna on Monday failed to bridge differences between OPEC\u2019s de factol eader, Saudi Arabia, and the group\u2019s second- and third-largest producers over the mechanics of output cuts. \u201cWe will leave the level of production (where) we decided in Algeria,\u201d Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters upon arrival in Vienna, effectively signalling he was not prepared to reduce output. OPEC, which accounts for a third of global oil production, agreed in September to cap output at around 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day versus the current 33.64 million bpd to prop up oil prices, which have halved since mid-2014. OPEC said it would exempt Iran, Libya and Nigeria from cutsas their output has been crimped by unrest and sanctions. The deal was seen as a victory for Iran. Tehran has long argued it wants to raise production to regain market share lost under Western sanctions, when its political arch-rival SaudiArabia increased output. In recent weeks, Riyadh offered to cut its own output by 500,000 barrels per day, according to OPEC sources, and suggested Iran limit production at around 3.8 million bpd - in line with or slightly above the country\u2019s current output. But Tehran has sent mixed signals including that it wanted to produce 4.2 million bpd. Here\u2019s a video clip of the scrum (or possibly rolling maul) which greeted Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, as he arrived in Vienna. Listen out for the breaking vase! There is high drama in Vienna, where Iran\u2019s oil minister has declared that his country will NOT cut oil production. Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told a heaving throng of oil reporters that Iran would stick to the production levels set earlier this year, and would not accept any output cuts. That\u2019s a blow to Opec\u2019s chances of finalising a deal to cut production levels at tomorrow\u2019s official meeting in Vienna. And Bloomberg is now reporting that Saudi will reject a deal, unless Iran and Iraq agree to a compromise These comments have sent the Brent crude oil price plunging by over 3% to 46.51 per barrel, down over 1.5 dollars. The press scrum also sent a vase flying to the floor of Opec\u2019s hotel foyer -- the second broken vase in as many days! As we covered earlier, Indonesia\u2019s oil minister had also told reporters that he\u2019s not optimistic about a deal this week. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says traders aren\u2019t confident either: Reports of Russia not attending the OPEC gathering has dented hopes of a meaningful deal while concerns of Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia failing to bridge their differences continues to encourage sellers to attack oil. The US Federal Reserve is now even more likely to hike interest rates next month, says Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cRobust US GDP growth in the third quarter, driven by household demand, was a marked improvement on the first half of the year. \u201cThis should bolster the case for a rise in US interest rates in December. We think the Fed will wait until they see the scale and timing of any Trumpflation fiscal boost, before altering their language about gradual rate hikes.\u201d Today\u2019s growth figures are a sign that America has recovered from a slow start to 2016, says the FT\u2019s Adam Samson. The data released on Tuesday confirm that the economy expanded in the third quarter at the fastest rate in two years, representing a sharp pick-up from the 0.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent pace logged in the first and second quarters, respectively. Consumption growth, a key element of US economic output, was revised higher to a 2.8 per cent pace, from the previous reading of 2.1 per cent. FT: US GDP revision confirms strengthening recovery The Wall Street Journal is impressed by the pick-up in corporate profits: Tuesday\u2019s report also showed that a key measure of U.S. corporate profits increased for the third consecutive quarter. Profits after tax, without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rose 3.5% from the second quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.694 trillion in the third quarter. Compared with a year earlier, after-tax profits rose 5.2% last quarter, the strongest annual reading since the fourth quarter of 2012. WSJ: US GDP Growth Revised Up to Strongest Expansion in Two Years Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX reckons growth will continue to accelerate in the current quarter. Breaking! America\u2019s economy grew even faster than expected in the last three months. US GDP rose by an annualised rate of 3.2% in the July to September quarter, up from the first estimate of 2.9%, according to new data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This is the fastest growth rate since the third quarter of 2014, thanks to stronger consumer spending, exports (especially soybeans!) and federal government spending. That equates to a quarterly expansion of around 0.8% - which means America comfortably outpaced Britain, which only grew by 0.5%, and Germany and France (which both grew by a mere 0.2%). The Commerce Department says: The acceleration in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment, an acceleration in exports, an upturn in federal government spending, and smaller decreases in state and local government spending and residential fixed investment, that were partly offset by a deceleration in PCE (personal consumption), an acceleration in imports, and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Italian government bonds are strengthening, on the back of that report that the ECB would step in if the public reject Renzi\u2019s constitutional changes on Sunday. The yield, or interest rate, on its 10-year debt has dropped to 1.97%, down from 2.06% earlier. That means investors see the bonds as less risky. And bank stocks are pushing higher too; up 2.4%. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, argues that Sunday\u2019s vote won\u2019t trigger a major crisis. While there is the possibility of a slippery slope involving a snap election, a victory by the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement and then very real questions about Italy\u2019s ongoing membership in the Eurozone, it is more likely that an election is averted, with a good chance that Renzi will be reappointed as Prime Minister. Even in the context of an election, it isn\u2019t clear that the Five Star Movement would be able to govern by itself. In the less likely scenario that the referendum passes, this would enable the Italian government to move more briskly on many much-needed structural economic reforms. Insiders at the European Central Bank have told Reuters that they\u2019d step in and buy more Italian bonds, if Sunday\u2019s referendum leads to short-term market volatility. The ECB could use \u201cflexibility\u201d in its existing quantitative easing scheme to mop up extra Italian debt and prevent prices slumping, as investors digest the result of the vote. However, if Italy requires longer-term help, it will have to seek a formal bailout. Reuters says: The ECB could use its 80-billion-euro ($84.8 billion) monthly bond-buying programme to counter any immediate, further spike in bond yields after the vote, smoothing market moves and supporting bonds, according to four euro zone central bank sources who asked not to be named. The sources added the scheme was flexible enough to allow for a temporary increase in Italian purchases and that such a move would not necessarily need to be rubber-stamped by the ECB\u2019s Governing Council, which is due to meet on December 8 to decide on whether to keep buying bonds after March. But they stressed this would be limited to days or weeks, to counter any immediate market volatility, because the asset-purchase programme was designed to shore up inflation and economic growth in the entire euro zone and was not intended to fight crises in individual countries. Newsflash from America: Jewellery chain Tiffany &amp; Co has admitted that its flagship store in New York has suffered from being sited next to Donald Trump\u2019s headquarters. Tiffany has told shareholders that it has suffered \u201csome adverse effect on traffic\u201d, due to \u201crecent election-related activity\u201d near its New York store. That store is on the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street, adjacent to Trump Tower, meaning access has been affected by the protests against the president-elect. Tiffany also warns that it can\u2019t provide any assurance that sales won\u2019t suffer in the crucial Christmas period, or beyond. However, it also emphasises that the store provides less than 10% of its net sales. Tiffany describes its New York shop as \u201csimply the most famous store there is\u201d -- partly thanks to the exploits of Ms Holly Golightly. But it now finds itself right next to a massive security operation. Concrete barriers have been erected outside Trump Tower, and armed police are posted outside, at a reported cost of $1m per day. Security is likely to be extremely tight on 5th Avenue throughout Trump\u2019s tenure as president, depending how much time he spends at the Tower. His wife Melania, and son Barron, are expected to stay there until at least the end of the school year, and will require constant protection. The New York Daily News reported two weeks ago that the US secret service wants to close 5th Avenue down when the president is in situ, which would clearly be bad news for local shops. And the New York Post reports that local restaurants have suffered from falling sales. Willie Degel, founder of Uncle Jack\u2019s Steakhouse on 56th Street and Sixth Avenue, fumed: \u201cIt has been a complete nightmare. Pedestrian foot traffic is down tremendously. Everybody in the area is suffering.\u201d The good news for Tiffany\u2019s is that worldwide net sales increased 1% in the last three months. Here\u2019s its third-quarter results. Austria could also contribute to eurozone worries this weekend, when voters head to the polls to choose a new president. It\u2019s a straight fight between far-right candidate Nobert Hofer, of the Freedom Party, and Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leader of the Greens Party. Van der Bellen is running on a pro-EU platform, saying voters have a choice between \u201ca co-operative and an authoritarian style.\u201d As we\u2019re still in 2016, this may be tempting fate.... This vote was originally due to take place in September, but was postposed when the glue on some postal votes failed (very 2016!). Carlo Alberto de Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades, says traders will be watching events closely: We are seeing a weight of pressure on the euro due to the Italian Referendum and the re-run of the Austrian presidential vote, both taking place this weekend. They could impact the euro significantly. The oil price is sliding as Opec members struggle to reach an accord before Wednesday\u2019s make-or-break meeting. Indonesia\u2019s energy minister has sparked the selloff, by telling reporters in Vienna that he\u2019s \u201cnot optimistic\u201d that the cartel will agree a supply cuts deal tomorrow. Brent crude is currently down almost one dollar per barrel at $47.37, a 1.8% decline. Indonesia are only a small player, but traders are clearly desperate for any smoke signals from the Opec HQ. The success, or failure, of Opec\u2019s meeting appears to depend on Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. Analysts reckon that the authorities in Tehran and Baghdad has hoped that Riyadh would swallow the proposed output cuts itself, allowing them to keep pumping. But Saudi are taking a harder line -- even though their economy is suffering badly from the low oil price. Veteran Opec analyst Yasser Elguindi of Medley Global Advisors dubs it a poker game: \u201cThe stakes are extremely high, and everyone seems to be upping the ante. The thing with poker though is you can win even if you have a weak hand. But right now its hard to know who is bluffing and who is holding aces.\u201d Britain\u2019s farming industry is facing a labour shortage as foreign fruit and veg pickers leave the UK following the EU referendum. The Financial Times reports that half the firms who supply workers to the horticulture sector couldn\u2019t find enough labour in the July-September quarter. And the National Farmers Union is getting worried, the FT says: In a letter to Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, dated November 10 and seen by the FT, Minette Batters, the NFU\u2019s deputy president, warned: \u201cThere is a clear emerging labour crisis in the industry\u201d and \u201ca very real risk that British fruit and vegetables will be left to rot unpicked in British fields in 2017\u201d. Rural areas saw solid support for Leaving the EU in June -- but perhaps farmers didn\u2019t expect \u2018taking back control\u2019 to mean \u2018no-one wants to pick our carrots\u2019. Tax lawyer Jo Maugham points out that the slump in the pound means workers from the eurozone now earn almost 20% less. Anyone who likes a spot of Christmas pud faces further heartache -- the sugar, raisins and butter are now much pricier. The euro has dipped back below \u20ac1.06 this morning, down 0.2%. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver blamed \u2018political risks\u2019: The euro may have received some initial support as Fillon won France\u2019s Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination, before coming under renewed pressure. Political risks remain a downwards pressure on the euro; attention at the moment has largely been on Italy\u2019s constitutional referendum on 4 December. Boom! UK consumers are running up credit at the fastest rate in over a decade, before the credit crunch And people are taking out more mortgages too, in another signal that Brexit uncertainty isn\u2019t hurting consumer confidence yet. Reuters has the details: Consumer credit increased last month by \u00a31.62bn, up from \u00a31.48bn in September and taking the annual growth rate to 10.5%- the strongest since October 2005, Bank of England data showed on Tuesday. Mortgage approvals for house purchases increased to 67,518 in October from 63,594 in September. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 65,000 mortgage approvals were made in October. Over in France, statistics body INSEE has confirmed that the economy grew by a lacklustre 0.2% in the third quarter of 2016. That matches the provisional reading; we now also know that consumer spending was flat, investment crept up by 0.2%. Economists believe consumer spending will pick up in the run-up to Christmas -- that could be crucial, with the French presidential election due next spring. After a slow start, Italy\u2019s banking shares have now rallied by 2% today. That may mean investors are a little more hopeful that Italy can ride out this crisis. Erik Nielsen, chief economist at Unicredit, says there\u2019s no chance that the Italian referendum could trigger a Lehman Brothers-style collapse. Speaking on Bloomberg, Nielsen explains that thee Italian banks are too small, and they also have the European Central Bank waiting in the wings to help if needed. Nielsen says investors are anticipating defeat for Renzi on Sunday. Nobody really expects a yes vote, so it\u2019s a question about how close it will be and if those opinion polls from way back are right or wrong. But whatever happens, Italy needs to tackle the under-performing loans that are clogging up its financial sector. As Nielsen puts it: The big, big question is, whichever scenario comes though, can Italy address the question of the medium-sized banks which everyone knows they\u2019ve been dragging their feet on for too long. It\u2019s too early to assume that the Italian people will reject Renzi\u2019s attempts to reform the Senate, says Deutsche Bank. They point out that many voters were undecided last week (before we entered a polling black0out period). They might yet fall behind Renzi\u2019s drive to concentrate political power in the lower house, making it easier to get legislation into law. True... but as Deutsche\u2019s chart shows, the No campaign has been widening its lead for since the summer: Now this is interesting.... Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera is reporting that Matteo Renzi is considering resigning as prime minister even if he wins on Sunday. Under this strategy, Renzi would look to be re-appointed as prime minister with a new government, and broader support in the current parliament. Then he could push through more constitutional reforms, before holding general elections in 2017 and 2018. Here\u2019s Correire\u2019s piece. And here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take: Most European stock markets have fallen in early trading, extending yesterday\u2019s drops, as Italian referendum fears give traders an extra chill. However, the Italian FTSE MIB has actually risen a little after yesterday\u2019s 2% slide (it may only be a cattus mortuus bounce, as the index has lost 28% in the last year). Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts nervousness until the weekend: Since we\u2019ll hear no more about the Italian referendum until the event itself, I\u2019m not sure what is supposed to provide clear direction in Europe today. It\u2019s more a case of angst, which probably will, at some point, turn into nervousness sufficient to take the Euro back down. Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard warns that Italy could need a \u20ac40bn bailout to patch up its banks. He says markets are bracing for Renzi to be defeated on Sunday, triggering months of political turmoil. Sources in Rome say the Italian government may have to turn to the European Stability Mechanism for a bank rescue, a humiliating and painful course that must be approved by the German Bundestag. It would amount to a partial \u201cTroika\u201dadministration under terms dictated by the EU. One senior Italian banker said: \u201cWe think the banks will have to raise \u20ac40bn in fresh capital. This is going to need an ESM bail-out. The problems in the banks are becoming an excuse to put Italy under an EU programme. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen under Renzi because he won\u2019t be there any longer after a \u2018No\u2019 vote. What we expect is a technocrat government that pushes this through.\u201d More here: Global investors are becoming more concerned that the eurozone could break up, as fears over Italy\u2019s future grow. German research form Sentix reports that almost 20% of investors expect Italy to leave the eurozone in the next 12 months - the highest level since they started polling four years ago. Investors are worried that Matteo Renzi will lose Sunday\u2019s referendum, and concerned about the financial health of the Italian banking sector, says Julien Muller of Sentix. Overall, the chances that a single country leaving the eurozone has risen to 24.1%, well below the peaks over 70% seen at the height of the 2012 crisis. Global stock markets could be rocked next week if the Italian people reject Renzi\u2019s reform plan, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She says: A no vote on Sunday is a major event risk for the European financial sector. Up to 8 Italian banks could fail, as Matteo Renzi\u2019s bank bailout programme is likely to be scrapped if he resigns. It is not known what would replace it, or if the European authorities would step in to save the Italian financial system. If not, then the creditworthiness of some of the larger more systemic banks, such as Deutsche Bank, could be at risk. DB has plenty of risks of its own, if the European authorities don\u2019t save Italy\u2019s banking sector, then how could it justify saving Germany\u2019s largest bank? Thus, we could see further declines in DB\u2019s stock price before the week is out. Brooks also points out that referendum opinion polling has been suspended since November 18, creating extra uncertainty: This is likely to increase the tension and nervousness around this referendum, and could keep market volatility high for the rest of this week. The Vix, Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, started to rise on Monday, and we could see further advances in volatility in the coming days, putting pressure on stocks and causing safe havens like the yen and US Treasuries to rally. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Eurozone crisis jitters are returning to the City this morning, as investors worry that the smouldering problems in Italy\u2019s economy are about to burst into life. On Sunday, Italian votes head to the polls to vote on constitutional reforms - and many observers believe they will slap down prime minister Mattio Renzi\u2019s attempts to curb the power of the Senate. That could trigger Renzi\u2019s resignation, and potentially pave the way for radical, anti-Euro Five Star Movement to take power. That could scupper efforts to recapitalise Italy\u2019s banks, which are weighed down by bad loans, and possibly require a full-blown bailout from the European Central Bank. As Laurent Frings, head of credit research at Aberdeen Asset Management, put it: \u201cItaly\u2019s banks are at a critical stage in trying to rebuild their finances and, if Renzi loses the referendum and quits, then those efforts are going to be in deep trouble.\u201d Renzi\u2019s departure isn\u2019t guaranteed, even if he loses his referendum. He could potentially stay on as caretaker PM, but even this would leave Italy looking less stable. Renzi has insisted that political power needs to be more concentrated in the lower house of parliament, and the government, transforming the Senate from a directly elected upper house into a more consultative body representing Italy\u2019s cities and regions. Italian bank shares slid by almost 4% on Monday, dragged down by referendum worries and fears that financial firm Monti Dei Paschi\u2019s rescue plan might falter. Also coming up today... Things are getting frostier, literally and metaphorically, in Vienna ahead of tomorrow\u2019s meeting of the Opec oil cartel. Yesterday, technical talks between Opec members failed to reach a deal on how to cut production. (non-Opec member) Russia has helpfully weighed in, with Vladimir Putin saying it\u2019s important that Opec stabilises the market. In the UK, prime minister Theresa May will announce a crackdown on excessive pay at privately owned companies, to bring them into line with firms floated on the stock market. The announcement is due around lunchtime. Our City editor Jill Treanor has the story: Theresa May is to promise a crackdown on boardroom excess at large privately owned businesses as she unveils proposals intended to hold corporate Britain to account. The prime minister said the government would look at ways to bring privately owned companies under a regime that could mimic the one imposed on major stock market companies. While many private companies were performing well, \u201cwe have, however, seen an irresponsible minority of privately held companies acting carelessly \u2013 leaving employees, customers and pension fund beneficiaries to suffer when things go wrong. \u201cSo we will explore ways to improve and extend good governance across big business so that everybody plays by the same rules and we create an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few.\u201d We get a new healthcheck on the French and American economies today. 7.45am GMT: Second estimate of France\u2019s GDP for the third quarter of 2016 (first estimate was 0.2% growth) 1.36pm GMT: Second estimate of US economic growth in Q3 (first estimate was 3.0% annualised growth) Plus, entertainment group Merlin and sausage maker Cranswick are reporting results. And telecoms regulator Ofcom has announced it is \u201cproceeding with a formal notification\u201d to force BT to legally separate its Openreach arm, having been disappointed with progress to date.

    "webTitle": "Occupancy and revenues rise at Four Seasons Health Care", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest care home group, Four Seasons Health Care, has said its turnaround is gathering pace as it reported improved occupancy and revenues. Its parent company, Elli Investments, said 89.6% of the group\u2019s care home beds were occupied, the highest level for more than three years. Revenues rose 9% to \u00a3174.3m in the three months to 30 September, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation climbed 40% to \u00a319.7m. The Four Seasons chairman, Robbie Barr, said the financial performance had stabilised at the turn of the year and had improved from quarter to quarter. However, due to one-off costs related to the sale or closure of homes and restructuring costs, the group\u2019s quarterly loss before tax widened to \u00a327.6m from \u00a325.6m. Last year it made a pretax loss of \u00a3264m after writing down the value of its care homes. Barr said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the chancellor\u2019s recent autumn statement did not address the UK\u2019s care home crisis. He quoted industry figures from LaingBuisson that show a 5% reduction in fees paid by local authorities for care over the past few years due to \u201chistorical underfunding\u201d, resulting in a shortfall of \u00a340 to \u00a370 a resident a week. Additional pressure came from the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d in April and subsequent increases that are raising care home staff costs, as well as nurse shortages, which force care homes and hospitals to turn to expensive agency staff. A number of care providers have closed in recent months as cuts to council budgets meant there were not enough funds to run services. Care home providers, senior doctors and council leaders have demanded a funding U-turn from the government to prevent the system from collapsing amid care home closures. Four Seasons said it had closed 20 homes in the past two years and sold many more, including 18 in the first nine months of this year. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Ben Taberner, dismissed warnings from credit rating agencies that the group\u2019s financial position was unsustainable earlier this year as \u201cscaremongering\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s successful campaign to become US president has claimed one of its first economic victims after luxury jeweller Tiffany blamed protests at Trump Tower for hitting sales at its flagship store. Many of the demonstrations before and after the election have centred on the president-elect\u2019s skyscraper in midtown Manhattan, located on the same block as the jewellery store on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. The site, described by the luxury goods company as \u201csimply the most famous store there is\u201d, is a tourist attraction almost as much as a retail outlet, mainly because of the enduring image of Audrey Hepburn\u2019s alfresco dining and window shopping in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. While sightseers have never appeared to scare away customers, political protesters might be viewed differently by Tiffany\u2019s moneyed clients, at least according to a carefully worded results statement to Wall Street on Tuesday. \u201cWith respect to the impact of recent election-related activity near the company\u2019s New York flagship store, management has noted some adverse effect on traffic in that store and a continuation of sales softness relative to prior year and to the company\u2019s other US stores this year,\u201d the company said. \u201cThat store represented less than 10% of worldwide net sales for the three and nine-month periods ended 31 October 2016, as well as for each quarter in fiscal 2015. The company cannot provide any assurance that sales in that store will not be negatively affected by this activity in the fourth quarter or in any future period.\u201d The results take in the three months to the end of October, so do not include the final days before the election, nor the 8 November result, which led to further protests at the site. Tiffany said worldwide net sales rose by 1% to $949m (\u00a3761m) and comparable store sales fell by 2% over the period. Its chief executive, Frederic Cumenal, remained cautious about the company\u2019s prospects following a mixed year, with low bonuses for Wall Street bankers and weaker spending from foreign tourists. \u201cWe are encouraged by some early signs of improvement in sales trends, but we clearly need more positive data over time before this can be considered an inflection point,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The government has faced calls to take bolder action to reform corporate Britain after it launched proposals it said were intended to hold business to account following a series of scandals and rows over executive pay. Unions criticised the government for backtracking on installing workers representatives on boards and opposition MPs questioned whether enough safeguards were being put in place to avoid a rerun of the debacle at the collapsed department store BHS. The green paper \u2013 open for discussion for three months \u2013 was launched after Theresa May pledged to reform big business during her campaign to become Conservative leader. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said the publication of the green paper was intended to kickstart a debate. \u201cOrdinary working people who work hard for their living deserve to have confidence that businesses act responsibly and fairly,\u201d he told MPs in the Commons on Tuesday. \u201cThis government is unequivocally and unashamedly pro-business but we hold business to a high standard in doing so.\u201d Clark said the green paper asked whether shareholders should be given a binding vote on executive pay, how employees could be heard in the boardroom and whether private companies should be subjected to some of the rules faced by companies listed on the stock market. The document provided a number of options on each area \u2013 including the binding vote, which it suggested could be only on part of a directors\u2019 pay packet or when there had been significant protests about pay in the past. Iain Wright, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, which is running its own investigation into the topic, said: \u201cTentatively setting out a range of options in a green paper suggests a government whose resolve may have weakened on getting to grips with corporate governance.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the proposals were disappointing and that they would not do enough to \u201cshake up corporate Britain\u201d. Clark said workers\u2019 voices could be represented through non-executive directors. The consultation is taking place against the backdrop of the average pay of a chief executive of a FTSE 100 company rising to \u00a35.5m, from \u00a31m in 1998, outpacing wage growth outside the boardroom. Pay \u201chas grown much faster over the last two decades than pay generally and at times is not in line with corporate performance\u201d, said Clark as he pinned the blame on Labour. The business secretary said the concerns about corporate behaviour related to \u201ca very small number of businesses, which have undermined the reputation of British business generally\u201d. But the shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, questioned whether the ideas would stop another BHS \u2013 a privately owned company which left a \u00a3721m pension deficit \u2013 or Sports Direct, a stock market company criticised for its employment practices. \u201cTo force private companies to abide by the corporate governance code will do little unless that code is tightened. BHS may have been a private company, but Sports Direct isn\u2019t, and we all know what has gone on there,\u201d said Lewis. The green paper asks whether companies should publish their pay ratio \u2013 the gap between the chief executive and the wider workforce \u2013 but also cautions that the information could be misconstrued. In 2015 chief executives received 128 times the average pay of their staff, the document said. It also included proposals, first raised by the fund manager Hermes, which could require companies to set out the maximum amount a chief executive could earn. The paper asked if the current system of paying bosses though long-term incentive plans \u2013 share awards that pay out in three years \u2013 should be thrown out. It also questions if pay deals should be based over three rather five years. Business leaders supported the tone of the document. Simon Walker, the director general of the Institute of Directors, said he was pleased the government was \u201ckicking off a wide debate on how to ensure UK corporate governance is up to scratch\u201d. Chris Cummings, the chief executive of the Investment Association, described the paper as \u201copen and consultative\u201d. It is the latest attempt by politicians to react to a public outcry over pay. In 2012, the then business secretary, Vince Cable, made changes to the way directors\u2019 pay was announced and introduced a binding vote on pay every three years. The green paper was published as Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of the advertising company WPP, whose pay deals have previously faced scrutiny from politicians, was handed \u00a311.2m in shares that will pay out in five years. Sorrell received more than \u00a370m in shares and cash in 2015 and last year, Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, appeared to single him out when he criticised the gap between boardroom pay and the wider workforce. At the time Johnson quoted figures of a boss receiving 780 times of their workforce, which matched statistics compiled for WPP. WPP said the latest share awards were subject to tougher performance requirements and paid out a smaller maximum than in the past.",

      "bodyText": "The growing importance of Black Friday for UK retailers has been underlined by the latest sales figures, with John Lewis reporting its best ever weekly revenues of nearly \u00a3200m. The department store group said it achieved sales of \u00a3199.8m in the week to last Friday, up 6.5% on the same week last year. It traded well in shops and online, with shops becoming busier at the weekend. UK shoppers spent over \u00a32bn on their Visa cards on Black Friday, 13% more than last year. Half the spending happened online and contactless payments picked up, across all age groups, the card company said. Kevin Jenkins, UK and Ireland managing director at Visa, said: \u201cWe continue to see an increase in the shift from cash to cards when people do their Christmas shopping. Consumers are now armed with a variety of new ways to pay, such as wearables and a range of digital wallet options on their mobile devices.\u201d Barclaycard, which processes almost half of all credit and debit card transactions in the UK, said payment transactions were 6% higher than last year\u2019s Black Friday. Total spending amounted to \u00a32.9bn, although this also includes purchases not related to Black Friday. Many UK retailers now discount heavily in the days running up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and over the weekend in between, extending the period in which bargain hunters can seek discount offers. Some retailers stretch their sales into a longer period, with Amazon and some supermarkets kicking off Black Friday deals about 10 days before. However, this year did not bring the scenes of mayhem at shops seen in 2014, when police had to intervene in some places. Since the US-inspired shopping bonanza arrived in the UK six years ago, it has increasingly become an online event. \u201cThe question is how far it\u2019s pulled sales forward from this week and December,\u201d said Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s a big week, bigger than Christmas. The full story isn\u2019t yet told. That\u2019s going to be the question for all retailers.\u201d Industry figures from consultancy Springboard showed that online purchases rose 6.7% this Black Friday compared with last year, well short of the expected double-digit surge of 25%. Footfall at shops rose unexpectedly, by 2%. However, there was a dip in trips to retail parks and shopping centres between Friday and Sunday, according to Springboard. Pictures of empty Tesco superstores and shopping malls appear to confirm that trend. In the US, Cyber Monday was the country\u2019s biggest ever online shopping day, with $3.39bn spent online this year, up 10.2% on 2015, according to data from Adobe Digital Insights. Cyber Monday narrowly beat Black Friday, with takings of $3.34bn. Televisions saw the biggest discounts, of 20% plus. John Lewis said customers used their mobile phones to shop between midnight and 9am on Black Friday, but switched to shopping on their desktop computers once they arrived at work. At the busiest time on Friday morning, five orders were made every second on the John Lewis website. As elsewhere, electrical items were the biggest draw at John Lewis, with sales up 11% year on year. Bestsellers included Sonos Play:1 wireless speakers and GHD hair straighteners, Samsung TVs and KitchenAid appliances. Fashion sales were 4.6% higher. Sales were particularly strong in beauty, womenswear, menswear and sports. Ted Baker and Michael Kors accessories were popular, along with Barbour clothing and Calvin Klein pyjamas and lingerie. But the home department offered fewer deals on branded items and sales edged up just 0.9%. The group\u2019s Waitrose supermarket business made sales of \u00a3136.6m last week, up 1.3%. Beer, wine and spirits were the biggest sellers, with sales up 4.5% as people stocked up for the festive season. Turkey orders were almost a third higher than last year as Thanksgiving becomes more popular in the UK, and Waitrose also sold a third more pumpkin pie pastry cases. At Argos, popular products included iPads, PS4, Xbox, Dyson vacuum cleaners and Beats headphones. Football clubs including Premier League champions Leicester City embraced Black Friday, with many offering 20% off kit and other merchandise in their shops and online.",

      "bodyText": "A wide range of high-cost credit \u2013 from catalogue loans to overdrafts \u2013 is to be reviewed by the Financial Conduct Authority in a move that could herald price caps similar to those imposed on payday loans. Since 2015, the City regulator has prevented payday loan customers paying back any more than twice the value of the amount borrowed. The FCA will now look at whether the cap has restricted credit, driving customers to loan sharks. The findings of the review will be published in the summer of 2017. It is thought that as many as 400,000 people use high-cost credit deals from retailers to buy household appliances and furniture. After interest is added, consumers can often end up paying more than twice the original price, spread over a number of years. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, said: \u201cThis is a significant moment for our approach to consumer credit regulation as we continue to ensure that this market works well for consumers. \u201cWe have come up to the point of reviewing the cap on payday lending, making now the right time to take a broader view of the issues around high-cost credit, including unarranged overdrafts, and to consider whether our requirements remain appropriate.\u201d The evidence-gathering exercise \u2013 known as a call for inputs \u2013 will look at whether high-cost loans are causing detriment to customers. This could prompt the FCA to take action, such as imposing caps on rates. It listed doorstep lending, catalogue credit, some rent-to-own, pawnbroking, guarantor and logbook loans \u2013 where cars are used as security \u2013 as being in its sights. Overdrafts are also part of the review, which the regulator signalled earlier this month when it said these loan facilities would be part of its review into high-interest loans. The regulator is also aiming to establish what impact its intervention on payday loans has had. High-cost, short-term credit loans are capped at 0.8% of the amount borrowed per day, and for borrowers who do not repay their loans on time, default charges must not exceed \u00a315. \u201cThe FCA is also keen to see if there is any evidence of consumers turning to illegal money lenders directly as a result of being excluded from high-cost credit because of the price cap,\u201d the regulator said.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is not back-pedalling on her pledge to give workers a voice on company boards, the business secretary has said in response to criticism of the government\u2019s announcement that it will not force companies to give employees a governance position. The government unveiled proposals on Tuesday to tackle corporate excess. May had raised the prospect of placing employee representatives on boards during her Conservative leadership campaign over the summer, but has since told businesses she will not make them do so. Greg Clark said the prime minister wanted workers to be represented, but not necessarily by having an employee on the board. \u201cWe are not going to make it happen,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, adding that the government did not want to \u201coverturn what has been a successful system which has had the confidence of business around the world\u201d. \u201cWhat we are proposing today is a range of proposals, including a non-executive director who has an explicit obligation to engage with the workforce, to report into the board, to chair a stakeholder panel and influence the renumeration committee.\u201d Asked if the government was breaking the spirit of May\u2019s promise, Clark said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right \u2013 this is a big change in the way that we have conducted corporate governance. We have this legal tradition of having a unitary board, not delegates of groups but function for the whole interests of the company. That has been successful so I would not want to mandate the replacement of something that had been successful.\u201d The Trades Union Congress urged May to stick to her promise of putting workers on boards. Speaking earlier in the programme, the general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cIt It is very clear from the poll the TUC is publishing today, that the majority of people want the prime minister to keep her promise to have elected workers on boards. That\u2019s not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do, it is better for business too. \u201cIn countries that have workers on boards, which is the majority in Europe, it shows that they have better investment in R&amp;D, better investment in skills and they tend to take decision that are more about the long term, because of course, workers are champions of the long-term success of a company because their livelihoods depend on it.\u201d She urged May not to water down the promise by substituting workers on boards with a person who would represent the \u201cvoice of workers\u201d. \u201cHaving a glorified suggestion box or giving that responsibility to an existing member of the board does not amount to a genuine voice for workers. The only way you can have a genuine voice for workers is workers elect them.\u201d She said people were fed up with the behaviour of some boards. \u201cThere has been a degree of snobbery about whether workers can cut it in the board room. It is important that the prime minister, who said on the day of the autumn statement that she made no apologies for the fact that her government is going to deliver on that promise. If she doesn\u2019t then people will question what other promises could be broken.\u201d Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said May had \u201crowed back on her flagship policy of putting workers on boards. Sadly, this green paper looks like offering tokenism rather than a much-needed call to action. \u201cThe real test has to be whether these proposals would have saved jobs and pensions at BHS or prevented the gross mistreatment of staff at Sports Direct, and whether they\u2019ll tackle the scourge of low pay and escalated executive pay. Anything that falls short of doing that is just not good enough.\u201d Among the proposals for corporate reform could be the idea of publishing pay ratios \u2013 the difference between the chief executive\u2019s pay and that of the workforce. The green paper will have three sections: one on remuneration, one on stakeholder engagement and a third that asks what elements of these should apply to private companies.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is to promise a crackdown on boardroom excess at large privately owned businesses as she unveils proposals intended to hold corporate Britain to account. The prime minister said the government would look at ways to bring privately owned companies under a regime that could mimic the one imposed on major stock market companies. While many private companies were performing well, \u201cwe have, however, seen an irresponsible minority of privately held companies acting carelessly \u2013 leaving employees, customers and pension fund beneficiaries to suffer when things go wrong. \u201cSo we will explore ways to improve and extend good governance across big business so that everybody plays by the same rules and we create an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few.\u201d During her campaign to become prime minister in the wake of the Brexit vote, May had put corporate reform on her agenda, raised the prospect of employee representatives on boards and also of making votes on executive pay legally binding. In July, after a damning report by MPs into the collapse of department store BHS, she also prepared the way for closer scrutiny of private companies. Proposals published on Tuesday will reopen the debate about ways to clamp down on unacceptable boardroom behaviour \u2013 although May has already told business leaders that she does not intend to force companies to directly appoint workers or consumer representatives on to their boards. The TUC said she should press on with giving workers a greater say at the companies where they work, publishing a poll showing six in 10 people support the idea. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cWorkers on boards is a policy that\u2019s tried, tested and proven in many other countries. And it will work for Britain too, helping us build a stronger and fairer economy.\u201d The proposals being set out by the business secretary, Greg Clark, could raise the idea of publishing pay ratios \u2013 the difference between the chief executive\u2019s pay and that of the workforce \u2013 and will also attempt to bring private companies under closer public scrutiny. If stock market companies depart from corporate governance codes they are expected to explain why and the government could suggest that the largest privately owned companies adopt a similar practice under a newly created code of practice. The green paper will have three sections: one on remuneration, one on stakeholder engagement and a third that asks what elements of these should apply to private companies. The shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, said: \u201cThe problems of spiralling executive pay and poor corporate governance have escalated over the last six years while the government sat idle. The prime minister already rowed back on her flagship policy of putting workers on boards. \u201cSadly, this green paper looks like offering tokenism rather than a much-needed call to action. \u201cThe real test has to be whether these proposals would have saved jobs and pensions at BHS or prevented the gross mistreatment of staff at Sports Direct, and whether they\u2019ll tackle the scourge of low pay and escalated executive pay. Anything that falls short of doing that is just not good enough.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The globalisation of labour and the rise of automation has led, according to the former chief economist of the World Bank, \u201ca crisis in the global labour market\u201d. But Professor Kaushik Basu, in Australia to give a lecture at the Monash Business School, argues that the push by Donald Trump and political parties in Australia towards greater protectionism is precisely the wrong path to take. Instead, governments need to focus more on distributing profits to workers. For Basu, professor of economics and the C. Marks Professor of International Studies at Cornell University and former chief economic advisor to the Indian government, the time since the GFC has seen \u201cone crisis after another\u201d leading to a long period of economic stagnation. But among the biggest challenges economists and politicians have to face is that the increase of technology has spurred the globalisation of labour in a way never before encountered. According to Basu, the big change from previous technology increases has been the \u201csharp rise in technology that links workers in different places\u201d. This means that wealthy nations are now able to access \u201ccheap labour that was earlier tucked away in faraway places\u201d. Basu notes that there is no doubt that the ability to outsource workers has improved world GDP and the standard of living for people in developing countries and thus should be celebrated. But the problem is the \u201cbottom end of labour\u201d in rich countries like Australia, USA and the UK is now in direct competition with \u201cworkers in poorer countries who for the reason of being in poorer countries command a much lower wage\u201d. Basu says that while poverty is improving in developing countries, this competition for labour \u201cis causing inequality to get exacerbated\u201d in wealthy countries. He argues the crisis in the global labour market is \u201ca slow crisis\u201d as there is \u201cnever an event which makes news\u201d, but that it is \u201cfeeding into a lot of economic and political problems and manifesting in different ways\u201d. And for Basu, one of the most stark ways it is manifested is the declining share of national income going to workers. This decline is something that has occurred across most developed nations since the mid-1970s, but the drop in Australia is among the most marked. In 1975 two thirds of our GDP was in the form of wages; in 2014 it was just 53%: Not surprisingly such a shift has also seen real wages flatten, even while labour productivity improves: For Basu, this highlights that the winners from globalised labour are not just the worker in the poor nations, but the \u201cprofit makers\u201d in the wealthy ones. He argues the solution to the dilemma of outsourcing and the replacement of work by automated processes is to not think of it as a \u201clabour versus labour problem \u2013 workers in rich countries and workers in poor countries.\u201d Instead he argues, \u201cwe have to face up to the fact that this is also a wage versus profit problem \u2013 with an increase in the share of profits, and a decrease in the share of wages.\u201d One of the problems with thinking of it as a labour versus labour problem is the solution quickly becomes one of protectionism. But for Basu, this would just be a case rich nations economically cutting off their nose to spite their face. The problem is that outsourcing has actually been very good for economic growth in wealthy nations. The open economy in the USA of the 1980s and 1990s, he argues, allowed its economy to be much more flexible and thus able to best use its resources and could \u201csurge ahead\u201d while Japan which was largely protectionist, \u201cslowed down\u201d. He argues that were the USA under Trump, or Australia under a protectionist trade policy, to block the outsourcing of labour it would look very good \u201cat first sight\u201d because it would seem like \u201cyou\u2019re protecting jobs among your own workers in your own country\u201d. But he argues what would happen is that other nations would continue to use the cheap labour and would \u201cout compete\u201d the protectionist nation \u2013 hurting economic growth and hitting profit makers in that nation, and even more so, the workers. Basu is not an economist who only thinks in terms of GDP growth. Earlier this month, along with Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and three other former chief economists of the World Bank, he signed \u201cthe Stockholm Statement\u201d which seeks to guide policymaking. The first principle of the statement is that \u201cGDP growth is not an end in itself\u201d. Basu notes that too often those who argue in favour of reducing inequality and poverty do so by arguing that it \u201cis actually good for GDP growth\u201d. He argues however that while this is often the case, reducing inequality or poverty is \u201cworthwhile as an end in itself even if it slices off a little of the GDP growth\u201d. Thus he argues the way to respond to the declining share of wages due to globalisation and automation is for both an open economy (which is good for GDP growth), but also that governments must \u201cthink of some form of redistribution so that workers get their income shored up.\u201d To this end, while not discounting the idea of a universal basic income, he argues \u201cthe time has come to allow workers to get a share of profits\u201d. He also argues that this redistribution of income should also \u201ctake the form of better services likes health and education.\u201d Basu argues this \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean a need for a large government\u201d but rather it means a need for \u201ca redistributed government which takes away a slice from the rich and provides it to the workers in the form of health benefits education and also some form of profit share\u201d. Globalisation is not about to stop, and neither are the concerns of workers \u2013 especially as we are seeing in Australia a time of flat real wage growth and declining share of income going to workers. This does not mean we need to cower and put up trade barriers which will only exacerbate the problems. But neither does this mean we can carry on still thinking only of GDP growth. To both improve our economy and also dampen the nationalistic xenophobia that quickly turns to racism, governments must adopt policy more targeted to inclusive growth. They must realise that with the greater flexibility of labour comes the need for greater emphasis on redistribution of income. Failure to do so will only see inequality increase and the fires of nationalism \u2013 and all the dangerous sparks associated with it \u2013 burn hotter.",

      "bodyText": "Ikea UK is considering using different materials including bamboo in its furniture to keep prices down after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Gillian Drakeford, the UK manager of Ikea, said the furniture retailer is exploring the use of new materials as shops face up to the slump in the value of sterling since the referendum in June. Several leading high street names, manufacturers and economists have warned that Britain faces a sharp rise in inflation next year as businesses are forced to pass on an increase in cost to consumers. Drakeford declined to promise that Ikea will not increase prices, but said the Swedish company \u201cwill do the best we can to make sure the customer gets the best price\u201d. This includes looking at the price of installing products for customers as well as the materials it uses. Ikea already uses bamboo in some products, including a desk from the Lillasen range, the Rimforsa range of kitchen wares, and Ragrund bathroom accessories. Drakeford said: \u201cPrices are set against a number of factors and the value of the pound is something we follow, but it is very uncertain. Low price is one of our cornerstones. \u201cWe are always looking for new materials in order to make sure we can give low prices for customers. At the end of the day, we are about the best price for the customers and we will do the best we can to make sure the customer gets the best price.\u201d She was speaking as Ikea announced a 8.9% year-on-year increase in sales in the UK to \u00a31.7bn for the 12 months to the end of August. This is the fifth year in a row that Ikea has increased its British sales, securing its position as the biggest home furnishings retailer in the UK with a market share of 8.2%. Drakeford said the company is \u201cextremely proud\u201d of the performance and has not changed its investment or expansion plans in the UK since the EU referendum and the drop in the value of sterling. Ikea has opened four small order-and-collection shops in the last year, including a site in Westfield Stratford City shopping centre in east London and in Norwich city centre. The company also opened its first full-size UK store for seven years in Reading in July and will open another in Sheffield next year. \u201cWe will always stand by the decision made by people in the country,\u201d she said of Brexit. \u201cThe UK is a very important market for Ikea. It is the fourth biggest market and with only 8.2% market share there is a huge opportunity to double our market share and get closer to people in the market. \u201cWe are a long-term company so we really do see the opportunity in the UK. We are continuing with our expansion.\u201d Drakeford also defended Ikea\u2019s tax policy after claims by the Green/EFA group in the European parliament that it may have underpaid taxes by \u20ac1bn (\u00a3853m) between 2009 and 2014 due to aggressive strategies. She said Ikea had paid \u00a397m of corporation tax in the UK since 2012 and had not received any requests from the European commission for information about its tax payments. \u201cWe are a responsible company and we pay our taxes,\u201d she said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "North Sea oil firms are still laying off staff and slashing pay amid low oil prices but the industry is beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel, according to an annual survey. The note of cautious optimism came as oil prices rose slightly on Monday on raised hopes that this week\u2019s meeting of Opec oil producing countries will yield an agreement to cut output. Some two-thirds of all UK oil firms cut staff during 2016, according to the 25th Oil and Gas survey from the Aberdeen &amp; Grampian Chambers of Commerce, a record since the survey began in 2004. Companies, including BP and Shell, cut their headcount by an average of 15% in the year to October, while contractors, including supply chain firms such as Wood Group, reduced theirs by 7%. The survey also found that 40% of the 130 firms surveyed have adjusted working conditions, mostly by reducing pay. The figures support an estimate by Oil &amp; Gas UK that the prolonged oil price slump will result in 40,000 jobs being lost this year, on top of 84,000 in 2015. But while a third of the companies surveyed said they feared a negative impact from Brexit, the majority said the industry is on the brink of a recovery. Some 36% of firms said they believe the bottom of the oil market will be reached within the next 12 months, while 29% feel it has already passed. Most firms expect the rate of job cuts to slow next year, the survey found, while 16% expect their business to be growing by the start of 2017, compared with 3% expecting a decline. An overall gauge of business optimism in the oil industry improved from a record low of -78% in autumn 2015 to -35%. One anonymous survey respondent wrote: \u201cThe phoenix is rising. Those who have been sensible and survived will reap the benefits and there will be many.\u201d Uisdean Vass, oil and gas partner at law firm Bond &amp; Dickinson, which sponsored the report, said the industry was showing \u201csigns of the green shoots of recovery [...] even though the improvement is from a very low point\u201d. About 58% of firms said they see Brexit as having no impact on their business, a result that Vass said proved the oil industry was \u201cunfazed\u201d by the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. But 31% of the survey respondents said they believed the decision would ultimately have a negative impact. The tentative optimism of the survey chimed with a slight rise in the price of oil ahead of Wednesday\u2019s crunch meeting of Opec countries in Vienna. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has slumped from more than $100 in 2014 to an 11-year low below $35 earlier this year and is still hovering below $50 amid global oversupply. Prices rose by $1, or 2.2% to $48.30 during the day\u2019s trading, after Iraq\u2019s oil minister said it would co-operate with any deal to cut oil production that was \u201cacceptable to all\u201d. Opec members have already agreed in principle to curb output but political tensions between major producers such as Iran and Saudi Arabia have cast doubt on a concrete agreement being reached. The largest oil producers have expressed public support for limiting output in a bid to boost prices but have been reluctant to be the first to make cuts.",
