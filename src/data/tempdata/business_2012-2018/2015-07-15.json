      "bodyText": "Dozens of UK broadband customers have received letters from a US firm accusing them of pirating a little-known Robert Redford film and inviting them to pay a financial settlement on pain of further legal action. TCYK LLC, a legal firm apparently named after the initials of the film in question, The Company You Keep, obtained a court order against Sky Broadband this year requiring it to hand over the details of customers that TCYK alleges used torrent sites to download and distribute the film. The case is the latest in a series of speculative invoicing claims, whereby copyright holders issue letters to individuals demanding money to settle a piracy claim, with the threat of legal action if they fail to comply. The controversial practice relies on the assumption that the copyright owner can link a specific act of piracy with an IP address \u2013 the unique number assigned to every computer on a network \u2013 and that the bill-payer currently tied to that IP address is the same person who committed the copyright infringement. Many of those accused in previous cases have denied any involvement in file-sharing. In the latest case, the piracy is alleged to have taken place in 2013, but the the company making the claims is relying on subscriber data from 2015. Michael Coyle, a solicitor advocate at Lawdit Solicitors who specialises in intellectual property law, said he had been approached by at least 60 people who had received largely identical letters accusing them of downloading and sharing the film. Coyle, who is advising individuals who have received demands for money from TCYK, said that most people have denied pirating the film. He criticised Sky for not having responded more robustly to TCYK\u2019s case. \u201cThey should be fighting tooth and nail not to have this information released,\u201d he said. In March, the TorrentFreak blog reported that Sky had sent letters to those customers whose details had been released to TCYK, warning: \u201cIt is likely that TCYK LLC will contact you directly and may ask you to pay compensation,\u201d and directing them to Citizens Advice for further help. In the letter sent to Sky customers, TCYK says that it hired a \u201cforensic computer analyst\u201d to identify IP addresses of computers that were making the film available online. \u201cWe showed this evidence to your internet service provider [BSkyB] who would not supply us with the information without a court order,\u201d the firm writes. \u201cWe therefore made an application to court asking for an order against BSkyB that they disclose the names and addresses associated with the IP address on the date and at the time in question.\u201d In a section of the letter headlined \u201cProposed Settlement\u201d, TCYK writes: \u201cWe will propose an appropriate figure to you \u2026 after we have received your response to this letter and carefully considered its contents.\u201d The letter makes third-person references to an unidentified \u201cclaimant\u201d who is the owner of the film\u2019s copyright and said to be \u201cvery concerned at the illicit distribution of films over the internet\u201d. A call to the phone number on the letter was answered by a paralegal based in Arizona, who said that TCYK was both the copyright owner and the claimant. The paralegal declined to state how many letters had been issued and said further queries should be directed to the company\u2019s email address. The Company You Keep is a political thriller set in the 1960s and also starred Julie Christie, Susan Sarandon and Shia LaBeouf. In its review, the New York Times rued that \u201cthis earnest, well-intentioned movie elicits frustration that its story had to be packaged as a conventional, not very suspenseful fugitive thriller with a bogus Hollywood ending.\u201d The 2012 film was produced by Voltage Pictures, the company behind The Hurt Locker and Dallas Buyers Club. Both films have also previously been associated with letter campaigns demanding restitution for alleged piracy. Nicolas Chartier, the president of Voltage Pictures, told the Hollywood Reporter this year that he had issued 20,000 lawsuits against individuals accused of pirating the Hurt Locker in order to \u201cmake a statement\u201d. \u201cThe day after we announced 20,000 lawsuits, the internet downloads of Hurt Locker went down about 40%,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, you know, you frighten people and then they stop.\u201d Previous speculative invoicing cases have been described by Citizens Advice as being \u201cbased on a number of misleading claims\u201d, and one previous case resulted in the lawyer behind a wave of letters being suspended from the profession for two years. In a statement, Sky said: \u201cTCYK LLC successfully applied for a court order against Sky. This means that we were required, by law, to supply TCYK LLC with the details of account holders that matched the list of IP addresses that they had identified. \u201cWe have written to all affected customers advising them carefully to read the letter from TCYK LLC and if they want any further help to contact the Citizens Advice Bureau.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US Chamber of Commerce is lobbying to prevent US-style class actions being brought in the UK courts as litigation funding expands to promote consumer rights. Campaigning under the title Justice not Profit, the organisation is claiming that the Consumer Rights Act 2015 will open the door to spurious legal claims that undermine the profitability of business. The UK litigation-funding industry has expanded rapidly in the past few years. It is estimated to have amassed more than \u00a31bn in capital to invest in court cases. Firms take on the costs and risks of cases and in return receive a proportion of compensation awarded in the final judgment. Over the same period, legal aid for claimants in civil cases has been repeatedly cut. Litigation funders, who operate like hedge funds, mainly target very high-value cases and have now begun repositioning themselves to take on mass lawsuits. Relatively few class actions have been funded by private funders in the UK so far. Bentham Europe, whose parent company is based in Sydney, is coordinating legal action against Tesco for aggrieved shareholders. The law firm Hausfeld is funding litigation by Apple users who claim Google has breached their privacy. But the Consumer Rights Act, which comes into force in October, introduces an opt-out regime, so that claims for redress can be brought on behalf of groups of individuals without the need to identify all the claimants. Cases will be brought in the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The current opt-in regime, which is about to disappear, is deemed not to be working and has resulted in only one collective action, when Which? magazine sued JJB Sports for overcharging on England and Manchester United replica football shirts. Other countries, including Australia, Canada and Portugal, have already introduced opt-in regimes. The Justice not Profit campaign is calling for tighter regulation. \u201cWithout adequate safeguards, the new \u2018opt-out\u2019 collective litigation system in the UK creates a commercial opportunity for \u2018unregulated and predatory\u2019 hedge funds and other investment firms with a specialised interest in litigation finance,\u201d claims the organisation. It added: \u201cEver since the 2008 financial crash, use of third party litigation funding, which is not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, has significantly grown.\u201d It is demanding the retention of the opt-in system. Justice not Profit\u2019s website acknowledges that: \u201cThe campaign is backed by the US Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, a not-for-profit public advocacy organisation affiliated with the US Chamber of Commerce, the world\u2019s largest business federation, which represents the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors and regions, in addition to state and local chambers and industry associations. \u201cMany of the US Chamber\u2019s members are companies that conduct substantial business in the UK or are British-owned and operated. ILR is therefore deeply interested in the orderly administration of justice in the UK.\u201d Some UK law academics are backing the campaign. Dr James Griffin, a senior lecturer at the University of Exeter and expert in intellectual property law, said: \u201cI would like to see some regulation that prevents groups of companies getting together and trying to sue however they like. There needs to be some regulation in my area.\u201d Professor Richard Grimes, director of clinical programmes at the University of York\u2019s law school is quoted on the Justice not Profit website as saying: \u201cConsumers should get fair compensation. The question is if that will happen when there are no caps on funders\u2019 fees.\u201d Chris Bogart, chief executive of Burford Capital Ltd, one of the largest litigation funders operating in the UK, said: \u201cThe US Chamber of Commerce is a very well funded lobbying group and represents the interests of a small number of very large companies. \u201cIn their corporate self-interest they want as little litigation as possible. [The British courts] seem eminently capable of managing these issues. It\u2019s clearly the policy of the UK government to encourage litigation funding.\u201d The industry is self-regulated through the Association of Litigation Funders. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of any problems in the UK,\u201d Bogart added. \u201cLitigation funding is a very small percentage of an enormous market. \u201cLitigation is extremely expensive and means in many cases consumers can\u2019t get redress. In the US, pretty much the only way is through a class action,\u201d he said. Bogart added that he had recently taken part in a class action against a credit card company to recover disputed sums lost in foreign exchanges. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have recovered that relatively small sum of $300 unless it was through collective action.\u201d There is no sign of government concern over the issue. The Ministry of Justice said it was a matter for the Department of Business, Skills and Innovation. A spokesperson for the department said: \u201cWe are not introducing a US-style class actions regime. The Consumer Rights Act is about getting a better deal for businesses and consumers. The current opt-in regime isn\u2019t working, so we are transforming the system to ensure consumers and small businesses can hold those that breach competition law to account in the way big businesses can.\u201d The business department has said there would be significant safeguards to control the types of cases that will be brought in the UK. Treble or exemplary damages charges will not be permitted, cases will be restricted to the specialist Competition Appeal Tribunal and claims will have to be certified that they are representative of broader consumer problems and not vexatious. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 July 2015 to correct a quote from Chris Bogart.",

      "bodyText": "Protesters have taken to the streets in 14 German cities to show their anger with their government\u2019s handling of the Greek crisis, as opposition to the bailout deal appeared to be growing within Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrat (CDU) party. Anti-austerity demonstrations by a vocal minority of Germans took place in cities including Berlin, Frankfurt and Hamburg, with the radical left in the EU\u2019s economic powerhouse proclaiming its solidarity with those across the world who are furious with Berlin for its role in forming Monday\u2019s agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s a protest against the undemocratic politics of Europe,\u201d said Marek Polgesek, a 25-year-old student from western Germany. \u201cGermany isn\u2019t solely responsible, but it has an exceptional history, bringing great responsibility, which the government is not living up to.\u201d In Berlin, several hundred protesters gathered on Oranienplatz in Kreuzberg waving Greek flags and banners stating simply \u201cOxi\u201d (no in Greek) or #thisisacoup. Wassilia Fotiadou held a home-made sign pleading for \u201cno more crimes out of Germany.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m furious with these criminals,\u201d said Fotiadou, 56, a Greek teacher who has lived in Germany all her life. \u201cI don\u2019t want my taxes supporting this criminal coup.\u201d Sabine Feuer, 23, a student, said: \u201cWe have the responsibility here in Germany to do something to protest against this government. This is just the beginning.\u201d The protesters plan to rally on Friday outside the Bundestag and everyWednesday at the finance ministry. Aaron Bruckmiller, spokesman for the Frankfurt branch of the demonstrations\u2019 organisers, Blockupy, said: \u201cWe\u2019re out to show solidarity with the brave Greek \u2018no/oxi\u2019 voters. To protest with fire in our bellies against the German government\u2019s coup. We stand for the revival of hope for a dignified future for the people of Greece.\u201d In what was one of the worst weeks in recent history for Germany\u2019s image abroad, editorials from Paris to Rome attacked the German government as authoritarian and egotistical, and accused it of trampling over Greek sovereignty. Outraged Twitter users from all over the world posted pictures of the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, emblazoned with swastikas and images from the Nazi occupation of Greece under the hashtag #Thisisacoup. Others demanded a boycott of German goods. \u201cWe\u2019d never call the German finance minister a Nazi,\u201d said Marlies Sommer, a spokeswoman for TOP Berlin, an anti-capitalist group. \u201cBut given the total domination the German government is trying to impose on Greece, the analogies are somewhat striking.\u201d A growing number of Germans are speaking out about the ultimatum to Greece. Opposition to the deal is building across the political spectrum, with not just the far left but a swelling camp of rebels within her own party lining up to oppose Merkel\u2019s current course \u2013 albeit for different reasons. Writing in the Bild newspaper on Wednesday, several politicians of the conservative CDU said they would vote against the latest bailout negotiations when the proposal is put to parliament at the end of the week. An unnamed source within the CDU was quoted as saying there were at least 50 potential rebels, a figure the Guardian could not confirm. Some MPs said they had lost sympathy for Greece. \u201cI voted for the first two bailouts, because I still had hope that Greece would recover,\u201d wrote Erika Steinbach, a CDU MP. \u201cBut this time I\u2019m saying no. I can\u2019t believe that Greece will implement the agreed reforms.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll definitely be voting against further help for Greece so that [Yanis] Varoufakis isn\u2019t proven right in the end,\u201d the CDU\u2019s Klaus-Peter Willsch wrote of the former Greek finance minister. \u201cGerman MPs are not puppets who have to raise their hands when the puppet master wants them to.\u201d Merkel has said she will only recall MPs from their summer recess to vote on negotiating a third bailout if the Greek parliament passes the deal on Wednesday night. If the deal holds until Friday, it will be the sixth time the German parliament has voted on loans for Greece since 2010. But even Sch\u00e4uble has cast doubt on German commitment to the Greek deal by saying that he still believed in his temporary Grexit plan and claimed he had the support of many in the German government. \u201cThere are a lot of people, also in the German government, who are fairly convinced that in the interests of Greece and the Greek people the [Grexit plan] would be the better option,\u201d the embattled minister told journalists after a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels on Tuesday. It was a comment that prompted Merkel\u2019s Social Democrat (SPD) partners in the grand coalition to demand she rein him in. \u201c[Merkel] has to deal with her finance minister,\u201d the party\u2019s vice-chairman Ralf Stegner told Der Spiegel. \u201cThe deal agreed at the weekend ultimately applies to the whole government.\u201d And the chancellor still enjoys the backing of most Germans. A poll by ARD-Deutschlandtrend after Monday\u2019s deal gave Merkel the support of 62% of voters.",

      "bodyText": "British Gas has cut prices by 5% just days after a financial regulator accused the big six energy suppliers of amassing \u00a31.2bn of excess profits in the five years to 2013. The company said the reduction in gas bills from 27 August would benefit nearly 7 million customers, but critics argued the cuts were not as deep as they should have been and noted that electricity prices were left untouched. The move by British Gas follows strong criticism in a major report on the industry from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) earlier in July, while new energy secretary Amber Rudd has also called on suppliers to pass on falls seen in wholesale power prices. Wholesale gas prices are down more than 20% on the levels of a year ago. Mark Hodges, British Gas managing director, said wholesale costs were only one consideration. \u201cThere are a range of costs that make up energy bills, some decreasing and others increasing. This reduction reflects our lower projected total costs for 2015 and 2016 and we\u2019re pleased that customers will see the benefits in their gas bills ahead of next winter.\u201d British Gas had already made a similar cut earlier in the year, as did other energy suppliers. However, Joe Malinowski \u2013 of price comparison website theenergyshop.com \u2013 said the latest reduction was \u201clong overdue\u201d, and British Gas should have reduced prices by a further \u00a370. \u201cWholesale energy prices at the start of the year indicated that retail prices should be around \u00a3140 lower, but the first round of cuts in January were more like \u00a330,\u201d he said. British Gas\u2019s standard prices will drop to a typical \u00a31,121, but supermarket Sainbury\u2019s is charging a typical \u00a3930 a year. The Sainsbury\u2019s tariff is supplied by British Gas. \u201cIt is anomalies like that that mean this whole energy market makes no sense,\u201d said Malinowski. Ofgem, the energy regulator that also came in for ferocious criticism from the CMA, pointed out that householders could save up to \u00a3200 more a year by switching to even lower cost providers. The CMA has recommended a range of reforms to make the energy markets work better for customers, including a plan to cap all prices for a while. Hodges said he welcomed the regulator\u2019s review, but warned there was a danger that price caps might lead to \u201cunintended consequences\u201d \u2013 including creating less competition, not more. The move by British Gas is expected to be followed by some of its big six rivals, while the issue of who to blame for high prices and low capacity is moves up the political agenda.",

More than 30% of shareholders voted against the remuneration policy which set out the plans to increase Spencer\u2019s salary from \u00a3360,000 to \u00a3750,000 but reduce the size of bonuses \u2013 which could be many times the size of his base salary. Some 34% of investors Voted against the remuneration report which sets out how Spencer and other staff were paid in the most recent financial year. Spencer, who owns 16% of the business, received \u00a33.3m compared with \u00a32m a year earlier. Robert Standing, chair of Icap\u2019s remuneration committee, had attempted to explain the new pay policy in the annual report issued before the meeting. \u201cWe recognise that the new salary for Michael Spencer is, in both absolute and percentage terms, very much higher than before. This is balanced, however, by a modest pension provision, significant decreases in maximum opportunity and maximum cash, and a material increase in longer-term, at-risk, share awards,\u201d Standing said.

The meeting took place as Icap issued a trading update in which it warned about the potential risks of a rise in interest rates and the ongoing attempts to secure a bailout for Greece. \u201cOverall market conditions have been mixed; while FX (foreign exchange) volumes have shown a significant year-on-year recovery, the continuing uncertainties surrounding Greece and the future of the eurozone have tended to reduce risk appetite and trading volume, whilst there is still no clear picture on the future direction and timing of any interest rate moves,\u201d the company said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European commission has proposed a \u20ac7bn (\u00a34.9bn) emergency loan for Greece from an EU bailout fund, defying the UK and other non-eurozone countries that object being on the hook for a crisis in the currency union. Didn\u2019t EU leaders just agree to an \u20ac86bn bailout for Greece? After poisonous negotiations, Greece\u2019s creditors agreed to a three-year bailout worth up to \u20ac86bn, but it will be weeks before Greece sees a eurocent of that. The deal was effectively a promise to start negotiations on unlocking financial aid from the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. Talks are expected to take four weeks, but will not even start until the Greek parliament has passed laws to reform VAT and pensions. The problem is that Greece\u2019s economic collapse is happening far more rapidly. A bridging loan has been proposed to fill the gap. What is the \u20ac7bn for? Greece needs \u20ac7bn by Monday 20 July. A total of \u20ac4.2bn is due to the European Central Bank and \u20ac2.5bn to the International Monetary Fund to clear arrears. The Greek government also has to fund wages and pensions. The country is broke and the banks are shut. But the bridge loan being discussed is not enough to cover four weeks of negotiations on a permanent bailout. In the first half of August, the Greek government must find a further \u20ac5bn to pay its debts and it is not clear where from. EU officials say they are waiting to see how quickly negotiations on the permanent bailout progress. Why are countries outside the euro being asked to chip in? Because no one came up with a better plan. Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner, thinks using the EU-wide bailout fund known as the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism is the least worst option. Another option would have been for eurozone countries to offer bilateral loans to Greece. But not even France, which proposed this idea, has volunteered any money. Doesn\u2019t the UK have an opt-out from eurozone bailouts? In 2010 David Cameron announced he had a \u201cblack and white\u201d guarantee that British taxpayers would not be drawn into eurozone bailouts. The prime minister was referring to an agreement stating that the EFSM should not be used \u201cto safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole\u201d. But the commission thinks the agreement does nothing to outlaw loans to a single country, although Dombrovskis acknowledged this technical argument created \u201ca political problem\u201d. Will taxpayers lose out? Countries outside the eurozone are likely to be offered guarantees against losses, so are very unlikely to lose any money if the plan goes ahead. A UK official said the government was \u201cimmovable\u201d on the principle that British taxpayers\u2019 cash should not be put at risk, but was prepared to be constructive. Eurozone countries are unlikely to get the the same guarantees, but the bridge loan is meant to be repaid within three months once the \u20ac86bn bailout kicks in. Greece\u2019s pressing need for debt relief, highlighted by the IMF\u2019s devastating analysis, suggests repayment of the \u20ac86bn is far less certain. What happens next? Eurozone finance ministers will discuss bridge finance options in a conference call on Thursday. Use of the EFSM fund would have to be approved by all 28 EU member states by a qualified majority. The UK could be outvoted, but it may drop its opposition if it is satisfied with the guarantees on offer.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Burberry shares drop as sales in Hong Kong continue to fall", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry\u2019s reliance on Chinese consumers was highlighted in its first quarter of trading as a sales decline in Hong Kong worsened and growth in mainland China slowed. In the three months to the end of June, retail sales comparable with a year earlier rose 6% to \u00a3407m, Burberry said in a trading statement. But investors focused on Hong Kong, where Burberry said sales \u201cdecelerated further to a double-digit percentage decline\u201d, while growth in China ebbed to the low single digits, from high single digits last year. Hong Kong makes up about 10% of Burberry\u2019s revenues at high margins and the group estimates that Chinese customers, including those travelling abroad, account for up to 40% of sales. Carol Fairweather, Burberry\u2019s finance director, said Hong Kong sales had been hit by a drop in visitors from the Chinese mainland because of tensions over reforming the way the China-controlled territory will elect its next leader. Animosity has intensified after last year\u2019s mass pro-democracy protests, exacerbating the culture clash between Chinese tourists and Hong Kong citizens. Fairweather said: \u201cWe have seen, for political reasons and other reasons, tourism from China to Hong Kong is significantly down and that is sector-wide. We manage the business for the long term, as we always do. All of our [Hong Kong] stores are profitable. There is no change to our strategy today.\u201d Burberry shares fell more than 2% to \u00a315.85. Fairweather said Burberry might renegotiate rents on some Hong Kong stores when they came up for renewal. Burberry was changing products in Hong Kong stores to appeal more to the local market with lighter fabrics and smaller bags, Fairweather said. The 159-year-old company has been transformed from an understated maker of traditional British raincoats, scarves and accessories into a global fashion brand increasingly reliant on newly affluent Chinese shoppers\u2019 appetite for luxury goods. The company\u2019s problems in Hong Kong could add to shareholder unrest at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting, where some investors are expected to vote against chief executive Christopher Bailey\u2019s potential \u00a350m pay deal. More than half of shareholder votes were cast against Bailey\u2019s pay at last year\u2019s meeting. Fairweather said Burberry was monitoring the situation on the Chinese mainland after plunging stock markets sparked worries about the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. Those concerns have increased since the end of June as Chinese investors, many of them middle class individuals, have lost trillions of dollars from the crash. Fairweather said: \u201cOf course we are mindful of a number of difficult external factors and that must be one of them.\u201d She said Bailey, who was Burberry\u2019s chief designer, a role he has kept, was closely involved with the company\u2019s response to problems in Hong Kong. \u201cWe have talked about the breadth of the senior leadership team under Christopher\u2019s leadership \u2026 all making day to day leadership decisions. He is a great designer and he is also incredibly commercial and it is that balance that has allowed us to remain agile and manage our way through this,\u201d she said. Burberry did not reduce its guidance for annual profit. Fairweather said problems, mainly in Hong Kong, would wipe out an expected \u00a310m gain from currency movements. In the Americas, where Burberry has enlisted Romeo Beckham to promote its products, sales rose by a high single-digit percentage after a slow start to the quarter. Analysts at Credit Suisse said Burberry\u2019s figures were in line with expectations. A downbeat set of results in May had sent the company\u2019s shares down about 9% before trading update. The analysts said: \u201cThe market has certainly been used to the company beating expectations on [like for-like-sales] in most quarters of the past two years. That said, we think in-line numbers will be a relief for the stock given mounting concerns about a bigger slowdown in the first quarter partly driving the recent share price underperformance relative to peers.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Burberry\u2019s reliance on Chinese consumers was highlighted in its first quarter of trading as a sales decline in Hong Kong worsened and growth in mainland China slowed. <br></p> <p>In the three months to the end of June, retail sales comparable with a year earlier rose 6% to \u00a3407m, Burberry said in a trading statement. But investors focused on Hong Kong, where Burberry said sales \u201cdecelerated further to a double-digit percentage decline\u201d, while growth in China ebbed to the low single digits, from high single digits last year.</p> <p>Hong Kong makes up about 10% of Burberry\u2019s revenues at high margins and the group estimates that Chinese customers, including those travelling abroad, account for up to 40% of sales. <br></p> <p>Carol Fairweather, Burberry\u2019s finance director, said Hong Kong sales had been hit by a drop in visitors from the Chinese mainland because of tensions over reforming the way the China-controlled territory will elect its next leader. Animosity has intensified after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/29/hong-kong-protests-confidence-media\">last year\u2019s mass pro-democracy protests</a>, exacerbating the culture clash between Chinese tourists and Hong Kong citizens.</p> <p>Fairweather said: \u201cWe have seen, for political reasons and other reasons, tourism from China to Hong Kong is significantly down and that is sector-wide. We manage the business for the long term, as we always do. All of our [Hong Kong] stores are profitable. There is no change to our strategy today.\u201d</p> <p>Burberry shares fell more than 2% to \u00a315.85. Fairweather said Burberry might renegotiate rents on some Hong Kong stores when they came up for renewal. Burberry was changing products in Hong Kong stores to appeal more to the local market with lighter fabrics and smaller bags, Fairweather said.</p> <p>The 159-year-old company has been transformed from an understated maker of traditional British raincoats, scarves and accessories into a global fashion brand increasingly reliant on newly affluent Chinese shoppers\u2019 appetite for luxury goods.</p> <p>The company\u2019s problems in Hong Kong could add to shareholder unrest at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting, where some investors are expected to vote against chief executive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jun/08/burberry-christopher-bailey-50m-shares-salary\">Christopher Bailey\u2019s potential \u00a350m pay deal</a>. More than half of shareholder votes were cast against Bailey\u2019s pay at last year\u2019s meeting.<br></p> <p>Fairweather said Burberry was monitoring the situation on the Chinese mainland after plunging stock markets sparked worries about the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. Those concerns have increased since the end of June as Chinese investors, many of them middle class individuals, have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/chinese-investors-despair-as-gains-wiped-out-in-tumbling-stock-market\">lost trillions of dollars from the crash</a>.<br></p> <p>Fairweather said: \u201cOf course we are mindful of a number of difficult external factors and that must be one of them.\u201d</p> <p>She said Bailey, who was Burberry\u2019s chief designer, a role he has kept, was closely involved with the company\u2019s response to problems in Hong Kong. </p> <p>\u201cWe have talked about the breadth of the senior leadership team under Christopher\u2019s leadership \u2026 all making day to day leadership decisions. He is a great designer and he is also incredibly commercial and it is that balance that has allowed us to remain agile and manage our way through this,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>Burberry did not reduce its guidance for annual profit. Fairweather said problems, mainly in Hong Kong, would wipe out an expected \u00a310m gain from currency movements.</p> <p>In the Americas, where Burberry has enlisted Romeo Beckham to promote its products, sales rose by a high single-digit percentage after a slow start to the quarter.</p> <p>Analysts at Credit Suisse said Burberry\u2019s figures were in line with expectations. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/20/burberry-shares-fall-slashes-profits-growth-guidance-by-80-fashion-currency-rates\">A downbeat set of results in May</a> had sent the company\u2019s shares down about 9% before trading update.</p> <p>The analysts said: \u201cThe market has certainly been used to the company beating expectations on [like for-like-sales] in most quarters of the past two years. That said, we think in-line numbers will be a relief for the stock given mounting concerns about a bigger slowdown in the first quarter partly driving the recent share price underperformance relative to peers.\u201d<br></p>",

The proposed use of the European Financial Stability Mechanism fund is a blow to the UK, because David Cameron thought he had secured in 2010 a \u201cblack and white\u201d British opt-out from participating in any further bailouts for eurozone countries. In the 2015 Conservative manifesto, the prime minister claimed: \u201cWe took Britain out of eurozone bailouts \u2013 the first ever return of powers from Brussels.\u201d However, with Greece needing an emergency cash lifeline of \u20ac7bn by Monday, the European commission has concluded this is the best way of avoiding a catastrophic banking collapse in the country. Germany has expressed scepticism about reviving the EFSM, as have countries such as Denmark and the Czech Republic. But the commission formally proposed using the EFSM on Wednesday \u201cin the absence of a better solution\u201d and a decision will now be made by the council of finance ministers. Valdis Dombrovkis, the euro commissioner, said it was \u201cnot an easy solution\u201d and the group would have to \u201cwork to address concerns of non-euro members\u201d so that they have enough guarantees against any negative financial consequences. On Tuesday, Osborne insisted he would oppose any deal in which UK taxpayer cash was put on the line, arguing that the \u201ceurozone needs to foot its own bill\u201d. However, he may end up having to back down and accept the use of the EFSM as long as Britain and other non-eurozone countries are given an extra indemnity against losses. If this happens, Osborne is likely to argue that guarantees against losses means UK taxpayer cash is not in jeopardy. Treasury sources have told Sky News they could consider the use of the EFSM \u201cviable\u201d as long as there are indemnities. Speaking in the House of Commons, Cameron insisted it was \u201cnot for us to bail out Greece\u201d but he was not pushed on the use of the EFSM by Harriet Harman, the acting Labour leader. \u201cWe are not involved in the debate directly because we are not in the euro,\u201d Cameron said. The prime minister also asked about the International Monetary Fund\u2019s concerns that the current bailout proposals will not sort out Greece\u2019s parlous financial situation. He said the government talked to the IMF on a \u201cvery regular basis\u201d and the organisation\u2019s suggestion that debt relief would be needed \u201cmust be right\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays faces further boardroom upheaval after it emerged the deputy chairman who played a key role in ousting chief executive Antony Jenkins last week is also to leave the bank. Sir Michael Rake stunned the City when he pushed out Jenkins, three years after he replaced Bob Diamond as chief executive in the wake of the Libor scandal. Rake will become chairman of Worldpay, the payments system company thought to be planning a stock market flotation, on 1 September. A former accountant, Rake has been on the board of Barclays since 2008, throughout the financial crisis and Libor scandal, and the resulting changes at the top of the bank. John Varley was succeeded in 2010 by Bob Diamond as chief executive, who in turn left in the wake of the Libor crisis and was replaced by Jenkins in August 2012. Rake, who is expected to leave the Barclays board at the end of the year, spent 30 years at accountants KPMG before embarking on a boardroom career. He also chairs telecoms company BT which held its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday as news of his appointment to Worldpay was revealed. Shares in Barclays dipped initially as news of Rake\u2019s departure emerged to add to the intrigue surrounding the axing of Jenkins. From Friday, the bank will be run by John McFarlane, the newly arrived chairman who is temporarily taking charge until a new chief executive can be found. McFarlane\u2019s elevation needs to be formally ratified by the Bank of England in the coming days. Regulators and City investors tend to frown upon executive chairman, preferring a seperate chief executive to be appointed. Last week, Rake insisted it was he \u2013 not McFarlane \u2013 who orchestrated Jenkins\u2019 departure after reflecting \u201clong and hard on the issue of group leadership\u201d and holding conversations with the non-executive directors on the board. McFarlane is preparing to present the bank\u2019s results on 29 July when he is also expected to set out any changes to the investment bank, which has been the subject of repeated controversy at Barclays. When Jenkins\u2019 departure was announced, the board insisted there would be no change to his strategy of paring back the investment bank and cutting up to 19,000 jobs to reduce costs. Even so, the pace of change inside the investment arm is said to be one of the reasons for the departure of Jenkins, a retail banker by background. McFarlane, who stepped in to run the insurer Aviva after the chief executive Andrew Moss left in 2012, has told staff the bank\u2019s share price could double in the next three years or so. Barclays said : \u201cSir Michael Rake is the deputy chairman and senior independent director on the Barclays board. Sir Michael intends to continue in these positions, and be a member of the board until at least the end of 2015. If and when he stands down from the Barclays board, a new senior independent director will of course have been appointed.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Imagine you are Barack Obama looking at events in Greece from the other side of the Atlantic. Your European allies have been telling you for the past five years that they can sort out their own problems and there is no need for Washington to get involved. But Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande have not delivered. What do you do? The answer is that you start to flex your muscles. You use American influence over the International Monetary Fund to ensure that a document highly critical of Europe\u2019s latest botched attempt to sort out Greece enters the public domain. What\u2019s more, you choose your moment well. Just 24 hours before the hugely contentious deal is voted on in Athens, you arrange for the IMF to drop a bombshell: the agreement won\u2019t work. So when Jack Lew, the US Treasury secretary meets his German counterpart Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble on Wednesday, Berlin will be ready for the message from the White House: the president says enough is enough; cut the Greeks a lot more slack; provide deeper debt relief; keep the single currency intact. The decision by Obama to drop the softly-softly approach has been coming for some time. There have been pointed comments about the need for a growth plan for Greece. There have been telephone calls to Berlin and Paris. There has been pressure on the Europeans at meetings of the G7 industrial nations and the broader G20 gathering of major developed and developing countries. An earlier debt sustainability analysis was leaked in the days leading up to the Greek referendum and helped harden opposition to the (less draconian) terms then on offer. Again, the fund chose its moment well. Again, the fingerprints of the US Treasury were all over it. But it didn\u2019t work. Europe has insisted on foisting upon Greece an agreement the US thinks is doomed to fail. So now Washington has made it clear that it is prepared to use its influence to ensure that the fund does not take part in a third bailout unless there is enough debt relief to make the \u201ccash for reform\u201d package add up. The assumption when the deal between Greece and its creditors was agreed in principle on Monday was that the IMF would provide around 20% of the money required, just over \u20ac16bn. But this is far from guaranteed. Following the release of its demolition job on the plan drawn up after the marathon talks at the weekend, an IMF official said \u201ca concrete and ambitious solution to the Greek debt problem\u201d is a prerequisite to the IMF taking a new programme to its board. Few were in any doubt about what the official meant, nor about who was really speaking. This was the US Treasury saying that Europe had a decision to make. It could wait 30 years for Greece to start paying its debts; it could provide more financial support to Athens to allow it to meet its debt payments; or it could write down part of the debt. If it did none of these things, the fund would wash its hands of Greece. Obama can do this because the US dominates the IMF and has done so ever since the organisation was created at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. Europe has always had the right to choose the fund\u2019s managing director, currently France\u2019s Christine Lagarde, but nothing can be done without American approval. There is both an economic and geopolitical dimension to the US critique. Put simply, the US approach to economics during the crisis and its aftermath has been to put growth before deficit reduction. The idea was to get the economy moving first, then turn to sorting out the public finances. Europe, exemplified by Germany, has taken the opposite approach. The evidence suggests that the US approach works better. Even so, Greece wouldn\u2019t matter so much to the Americans were it not for the fact that it is seen as a key member of Nato in the eastern Mediterranean, a region that the US thinks is already unstable enough. Washington is worried about the conflict in Ukraine. It is worried about the civil war in Syria. It is worried about Turkey. It is worried about the possibility that a Greece outside the euro and desperate for foreign cash would cosy up to Moscow and Beijing. All things considered, Obama thinks it is worth being a lot more generous to Greece in order to ensure that it doesn\u2019t leave the euro. The US has plenty of allies among the other non-European members of the IMF. India, Brazil and China all expressed misgivings about the original bailout in 2010 and \u2013 on the basis of the debt sustainability analysis \u2013 will see the latest plan as throwing good money after bad. The US probably doesn\u2019t need to use its veto power to block IMF involvement in a third bailout: the organisation would have to break its own rules and go against the wishes of many of its member countries in order to do so. Various tensions have been exposed by the Greek crisis. There is the schism between Greece and its eurozone partners. There is the split between Germany and France. The latest rift to emerge is between the US and Europe. Lagarde, a European at the head of an institution that the US directs, will need all her famed charm to smooth things over.",

      "body": "<p>Imagine you are Barack Obama looking at events in Greece from the other side of the Atlantic. Your European allies have been telling you for the past five years that they can sort out their own problems and there is no need for Washington to get involved. But Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande have not delivered. What do you do?</p> <p>The answer is that you start to flex your muscles. You use American influence over the International Monetary Fund to ensure that a document highly critical of Europe\u2019s latest botched attempt to sort out Greece enters the public domain. What\u2019s more, you choose your moment well. Just 24 hours before the hugely contentious deal is voted on in Athens, you arrange for the IMF to drop a bombshell: the agreement won\u2019t work.</p> <p>So when Jack Lew, the US Treasury secretary meets his German counterpart Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble on Wednesday, Berlin will be ready for the message from the White House: the president says enough is enough; cut the Greeks a lot more slack; provide deeper debt relief; keep the single currency intact.</p> <p>The decision by Obama to drop the softly-softly approach has been coming for some time. There have been pointed comments about the need for a growth plan for Greece. There have been telephone calls to Berlin and Paris. There has been pressure on the Europeans at meetings of the G7 industrial nations and the broader G20 gathering of major developed and developing countries. An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/02/imf-greece-needs-extra-50bn-euros\">earlier debt sustainability analysis</a> was leaked in the days leading up to the Greek referendum and helped harden opposition to the (less draconian) terms then on offer. Again, the fund chose its moment well. Again, the fingerprints of the US Treasury were all over it.</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t work. Europe has insisted on foisting upon Greece an agreement the US thinks is doomed to fail. So now Washington has made it clear that it is prepared to use its influence to ensure that the fund does not take part in a third bailout unless there is enough debt relief to make the \u201ccash for reform\u201d package add up.</p> <p>The assumption when the deal between Greece and its creditors was agreed in principle on Monday was that the IMF would provide around 20% of the money required, just over \u20ac16bn.

      "bodyText": "The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey released each year is an excellent way to map how Australia is changing, and what makes us tick. The survey released on Wednesday shows that inequality improved slightly in 2012, and Australia\u2019s dependency upon welfare also remains well below the levels of 10-15 years ago. But, while median and average incomes continued in 2012 to grow, the survey also shows that the poverty rates for most household types remain above the low levels achieved prior to the GFC. The latest annual Hilda survey contains findings up to 2012, so to a large extent it is a historical document rather than one that paints a picture of how things are now. But nevertheless, it does provide a very good depiction of the changes of Australian life this century. While the survey does contain numerous social aspects, economic factors always take centre-stage. The survey found that in 2012 the average equivalised household disposable income for a single person was $48,935, and the median was $43,210: Thus, for a family of two adults and two children in 2012 to be on the average income, they would have needed a household disposable income of $102,735, while an income of $90,741 would see the same-sized household right on the median level of income. The survey found that during the mining boom, average incomes on the whole grew faster than median incomes, but that in 2009, during the GFC, the reverse occurred: The GFC hit higher income earners on average harder than those on low to middle incomes due to aspects such as the collapse of the share market. But since 2009, average incomes have risen by more than median incomes. As a general rule, when average incomes grow faster than median ones, inequality is increasing, as average incomes are affected more by increases of the highest incomes. Thus in 2009, the Gini coefficient measure of inequality fell, before rising again in 2010 and 2011, and then falling in 2012. The long-term look at inequality, which uses a five-year sum of disposable incomes, shows that the mining boom did slightly increase inequality, but that it has fallen in the past five years. However, it is worth noting that the 2012 long-term figure includes that 2009 abnormality of income growth, and that also since 2012 the cost of living for lower income earners has risen by much more than those employed: The low interest rates \u2013 and thus lower mortgage payments compared with rent increases \u2013 has seen the standard of living over the past three years, which are yet to be counted in the Hilda survey, improve more for wealthier homeowners than the poorer households. The survey also shows that while the gap between the rich in the 90th percentile of income and median income households closed slightly from 2000 to 2012, the gap between the median households and those in the 10th percentile has increased: So the rich and the median households look to be doing OK, but the poorest are in danger of being left behind. The long-term poverty rates also bear this out. While the percentage of households that could afford a basic set basket of goods has fallen, the proportion of households earning less than 50% of the median income grew during the GFC and since: As the long-term figures include the GFC years, the annual figures perhaps show a better picture \u2013 and indeed they do show a significant decline in poverty across households from 2009 to 2012: But again, the figures are somewhat out of date and do not take into account changes in the welfare entitlements since then. For example, while the percentage of lone parents in poverty declined in 2012, the changes to the single parent allowance, which saw many parents forced from the parenting payment onto the lower Newstart, only occurred in 2013. And when we look at welfare across the board, we discover (yet again) that any suggestions, by politicians or in the media, that welfare dependency in Australia is growing are complete nonsense. Across all measures, whether it be the percentage of households receiving welfare or dependency of welfare for income, welfare is much less of an issue than it was 15 years ago: The impact of the GFC and the persistent higher unemployment since then has seen a levelling of dependency, but certainly not great jumps that would demand a war on welfare or a \u201cstrong welfare cop\u201d. The survey has not only looked at changing incomes, but factors that influence them \u2013 especially the movement from unemployment to employment. It has found that having a dependent child is a significant barrier for women on returning to employment, but not at all for men. It has also found that whether or not a woman\u2019s partner was employed made no difference to whether she would return to work, but if a male had a partner who was employed he was more likely to do so. Childcare of course has been a major issue influencing female employment, and the survey shows that in 2012 childcare issues were growing. Seventy-three percent of couples with children reported difficulties with child care \u2013 whether availability, quality or cost, compared with 66% in 2010: The survey also found that the persistence of these difficulties over a one- year period was also growing: Given the major policy work done on childcare by the Abbott government, they would be hoping future Hilda surveys start showing some improvements on this aspect. And also, rather interestingly, the survey found that people who changed jobs were more likely to have larger wage increases than those who didn\u2019t. In 2010-11, women who changed jobs had an average wage rise of 8% compared with just 1.7% for those who stayed in the same work: For men an even greater difference occurred \u2013 in 2010-11 those changing jobs had an average wage rise of 10.2% compared with 1.9% for those who didn\u2019t change: Thus it would appear the way to higher incomes is to be prepared to move. But income is not the be all and end all of life satisfaction. The Hilda survey found that people were more likely to be satisfied with their life if they lived in small towns of fewer than 1,000 people, even though such areas were likely to have lower incomes. And when it comes to being satisfied with your married life, the survey found that your partner\u2019s annual income had absolutely no impact. It also found that receiving a major improvement in your financial situation also had no impact on marriage satisfaction. But money still does play a role. A worsening of financial situation reduced people\u2019s satisfaction with their marriage by about 3% \u2013 roughly the same level as if you are a non-smoker and your partner is a smoker. So perhaps the best advice is don\u2019t bother with changing jobs, stay constant in your work, and definitely quit smoking.",

      "bodyText": "Following weeks of stock market turmoil, China has confounded expectations that its economic growth would slow further in the second quarter, with gross domestic product rising by 7%. Analysts had widely predicted that economic growth would dip from 7% in the first quarter to around 6.8% in the second. However, GDP held steady, officials from China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics claimed on Wednesday morning. The figure still represents the lowest level of growth since the 2009 global financial crisis but is in line with Beijing\u2019s official target for 2015 of \u201caround 7%\u201d. \u201cThe national economy has been running within proper range and the major indicators picking up steadily, showing moderate but stable and sound momentum of development,\u201d China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement. The announcement of stable second quarter growth surprised analysts, offered a boost to Beijing\u2019s attempts to soften the country\u2019s economic slowdown and came after weeks of chaos in the Chinese stock market which saw more than $3tn wiped off shares. \u201cI think that at this particular moment \u2013 given the fragile sentiment which is still recovering from the market meltdown \u2013 not having very bad numbers is helpful. It\u2019s a matter of confidence,\u201d said Dali Yang, the director of the University of Chicago Center in Beijing. \u201cIf even the official numbers were significantly below official targets, that would help spread a gloomy sentiment. To generate a set of numbers that are in line with the official targets [represents] an injection of some confidence, it helps with the overall sentiment.\u201d However, there were immediate doubts over the growth figure\u2019s reliability with the announcement sparking renewed debate over the trustworthiness of Beijing\u2019s statistics. The fact that the figure was exactly in line with the Communist party\u2019s 2015 full-year growth target \u201craises suspicions,\u201d said Yang. \u201cThere is the issue of credibility, certainly.\u201d China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, tried to put a brave face on the recent stock market collapse during a meeting on Friday with economists and business leaders in Beijing. \u201cChina\u2019s economy still boasts remarkable tenacity, potential and flexibility,\u201d Li said, according to state media. \u201cThere is little doubt that China\u2019s potential for medium-high growth remains underpinned by strong, long-term fundamentals. The global economic recovery is full of twists and turns. China should push forward its own development with stronger confidence and greater efforts.\u201d However, Beijing has faced criticism for its handling of the crash. Chinese president Xi Jinping has vowed to reduce Beijing\u2019s role in the economy but as stocks plunged earlier this month the Communist party took drastic measures, including temporarily halting initial public offerings. \u201cIt does show that the Chinese markets are not exactly a free market yet \u2013 that this is very much a politically-affected market,\u201d said Yang, the University of Chicago political scientist. Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, who is a trained economist, have vowed to pursue a \u201cnew normal\u201d form of economic growth that is slower but more sustainable. Under that \u201cnew normal\u201d Beijing is looking to boost domestic consumption as it attempts to move away from its export-fuelled boom. Last year China\u2019s economic growth fell to 7.4% \u2013 the lowest level since 1990, when the country was facing international sanctions in the wake of the military crackdown on Tiananmen protestors. \u201cTo a certain extent, the latest slowdown is inevitable and desirable,\u201d Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, said on Tuesday ahead of the growth announcement. \u201cMore than three decades of break-neck growth, driven by over-reliance on exports and over-investment in sectors like real estate and factories, has left the country with vacant houses, idle factories and piling corporate debt.\u201d In its statement on Wednesday the National Bureau of Statistics warned: \u201cWe must be aware that the domestic and external economic conditions are still complicated, the global economic recovery is slow and tortuous and the foundation for the stabilisation of China\u2019s economy needs to be further consolidated.\u201d However, \u201cthe major indicators of the second quarter showed that the growth was stabilized and ready to pick up, the economy developed with positive changes, and the vitality of the economic development was strengthened,\u201d it added. But Wang Tao, the chief China economist for investment bank UBS, told Bloomberg TV: \u201cWe are not looking for an uptick in GDP growth in the second half ... We still think that for the year growth is going to be below 7%.\u201d Despite the stock market calamity, \u201cin general, the leadership remains upbeat about the outlook,\u201d Lian Ping, Bank of Communications chief economist, told the South China Morning Post. \u201cThe planned reform is still on the right track.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Tony Abbott, has moved to reassure Australia\u2019s live cattle industry that a sharp reduction in intake by Indonesia is just a blip and that exports will pick up again soon. On Tuesday it was revealed that Indonesia has moved to reduce the quota of Australian cattle by 80%, dropping from 250,000 last quarter to just 50,000 in the July quarter. Abbott told Macquarie Radio that the reduction was a \u201cdisappointment\u201d and \u201ca worry\u201d, but said the situation was not permanent. \u201cThis is a one-off reduction, it\u2019s not an ongoing reduction, because as you mentioned, Indonesia does have a rapidly growing appetite for beef,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll need more beef. It\u2019s going to be very difficult for them to supply everything that they need domestically, so I think in the medium term it\u2019s all up for Australian beef exports, live cattle exports to Indonesia.\u201d Abbott went on to indicate there could be a political reason for the reduction, but that it was Labor\u2019s doing, not the Coalition\u2019s. \u201cI think in some ways this is just one of the aftershocks of Labor\u2019s catastrophic decision to ban the cattle trade back in 2011. It\u2019s been a bit of a rocky road since then,\u201d he said. The prime minister acknowledged that Australia was looking further afield for export markets and that cattle producers would benefit from reduced tariffs flagged in a number of free trade agreements signed recently. The parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs, Steve Ciobo, told ABC Radio that Jakarta had not finalised its quotas, and that the directive to reduce imports was just an \u201cinformal notification\u201d. \u201cThis is only one quarter, and we will maintain dialogue with Indonesia,\u201d he said. Ciobo insisted that the decision to reduce imports was not a reflection of political tensions between the neighbouring countries, a sentiment echoed by the prime minister. The president of the Australia-Indonesia Business Council, Debnath Guharoy, told Channel Nine the relationship between the two countries was at a low ebb. \u201cThings aren\u2019t as good as they should be, nowhere near that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a relationship with this country and if it was in great shape I think we\u2019d be better off than we are. We wouldn\u2019t be caught as surprised [by the import reduction] as we seem to be.\u201d The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, on Wednesday announced he was seeking the input of exporters for a review of export regulation. The review will look at ways of cutting red tape and enabling innovation in the industry. \u201cWe want to make sure our agricultural export regulation will continue to help our agricultural export sectors access overseas markets while satisfying importing countries that we have met their requirements,\u201d Joyce said.",
