      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed with specialist assistants. As part of a substantial push into the UK\u2019s \u00a32.8bn beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and homeware sales fall back, the larger beauty aisles will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success. The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware. Sainsbury\u2019s said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time. Existing ranges from L\u2019Oreal, Maybelline and Burt\u2019s Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like Boots. The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly \u2013 something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers. In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury\u2019s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year. Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit. Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food. Sainsbury\u2019s has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable. The supermarket\u2019s previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure. Sainsbury\u2019s tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist\u2019s stores in its supermarkets. The new strategy comes after Sainsbury\u2019s sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for \u00a3125m, three years ago. It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores. Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury\u2019s commercial director, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers. We\u2019ve also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice. \u201cOur range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we\u2019re now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The billionaire businessman and easyJet founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, is taking legal action against Netflix over its comedy series Easy, claiming its use of the name breaches his company\u2019s European trademarks. In the latest crackdown on what he claims are growing numbers of \u201cbrand thieves\u201d seeking to \u201cpiggyback\u201d off his easyGroup business, Haji-Ioannou is seeking a high court injunction to prevent the $166bn (\u00a3127bn) US streaming company from using the programme name in Europe. Joe Swanberg\u2019s comedy-drama anthology series is billed as an \u201ceclectic, star-studded anthology [which] follows diverse Chicagoans fumbling through the modern maze of love, sex, technology and culture\u201d. Launched on Netflix in September 2016 and due for its third and final season in 2019, its ensemble cast includes Orlando Bloom and Emily Ratajkowski. EasyGroup has a strict policy of taking legal action to protect its licensees, including easyJet, the low-cost airline, and which use its striking orange branding. A spokesman for easyGroup said it would start legal proceedings at the beginning of the week, confirming a story first reported by the Sunday Times. He added: \u201cEasyGroup now owns more than 1,000 registered trademarks within the easy family of brands all over the world and takes its protection from unauthorised use very seriously.\u201d Netflix said in a statement that \u201cviewers can tell the difference between a show they watch and a plane they fly in\u201d. EasyGroup receives a steady income from licensing the brand to many businesses \u2013 including the airline \u2013 in return for a royalty based on their turnover. These include: easyHotel, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2014, easyBus, easyCar, easyVan, easyProperty, easyOffice, easyFoodstore, easyCoffee and easyGym. It warns on its website of \u201cbrand thieves\u201d whereby \u201csome people think they can make a fast buck by stealing our name and our reputation. They set up websites and companies using the name \u2018easy\u2019 (or phonetic versions of it) which can either pay a passing resemblance to an easyGroup company or be a direct copy.\u201d Haji-Ioannou said: \u201cThis is a case of typically arrogant behaviour by a very large American tech company who never bothered to check what legal rights other companies have outside the US. \u201cWhen Joe Swanberg came up with the name \u2018easy\u2019 for his new TV series a couple of years ago they should have checked with their European lawyers before using it. We own the European trademark in the word easy and another thousand trademarks with easy as a prefix and we can\u2019t allow people to use it now as a brand name, especially when they are doing it mostly with our colours and font. \u201cAt least I am pleased that Netflix have said that they will stop at series three anyway. However, we have to stop them from promoting the older series in Europe for online streaming.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Politics was once a simple affair. On one side were the lefties, unhappy with the status quo and agitating for something different. On the other side were the conservatives, suspicious of change. When it comes to Brexit, though, the natural order of things has been reversed. The right has come up with all sorts of visions \u2013 most of them dystopian \u2013 of Britain\u2019s future outside the European Union. The left, for the most part, has spent its time praying for the vote in June 2016 to be reversed. It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. There are those on the left who understand that there was a reason people who had never voted before came out in their millions to vote for leave, and who say that something must be done for communities hollowed out by the failed policies of the past four decades. They even have a soundbite: tough on Brexit, tough on the causes of Brexit. Similarly, there are left-of-centre remainers who recognise that something has gone seriously wrong with the European Union. They too have a slogan: a different Europe is possible. In reality, though, almost all the energy on the remain side has been spent on keeping the UK inside the EU come what may. There has been nothing from remainers that would suggest that they have a serious plan for tackling the symptoms of Brexit. The same applies to reform of the EU. A small number of people in the Labour party and in the trade union movement take a different view. For them, Brexit is to be welcomed because the EU\u2019s bias in favour of multinational capital, its hardwired monetarism and its obsession with balanced budgets means it is more Thatcherite than social democratic. For those remainers who say this is a caricature and that the EU is really about protecting labour rights and defending the interests of workers in a harsh, globalised world, left leavers have a one-word riposte: Greece. Since the referendum, this group has found it hard to get a hearing as the much larger group of left remainers has dominated the conversation with warnings about how the sky will fall in after Brexit. There is nothing new in this: many of the cheerleaders for remain were making exactly the same noises years ago when the UK was deciding whether or not to join the euro. Yet, in recent weeks there have been two publications that have challenged the mainstream view. The Left Case Against the EU by Costas Lapavitsas, a Soas economics professor, takes issue with the idea that the EU is all about cooperation and togetherness, a borderless paradise of interrailing and Erasmus schemes. The EU, Lapavitsas argues, is not a nation state that the left could battle to capture and then shape the way it is run. Rather, it is a transnational juggernaut geared to neoliberalism. The European left\u2019s \u201cattachment to the EU as an inherently progressive development prevents it from being radical, and indeed integrates it into the neoliberal structures of European capitalism\u201d, Lapavitsas says. \u201cThe left has become increasingly cut off from its historic constituency, the workers and the poor of Europe, who have naturally sought a voice elsewhere.\u201d This seems a pretty accurate assessment. The European left sees the EU as promoting democracy, egalitarianism and social liberalism, but the reality is somewhat different. The four pillars of the single market \u2013 free movement of goods, services, people and money \u2013 are actually the axioms of market fundamentalism, which is why Mrs Thatcher supported its creation. Meanwhile, the European court of justice has gradually turned itself into a body that enforces a free-market view of the world, placing more and more restrictions on the freedom of member states to make their own economic decisions. This point is taken up by Philip Whyman of the University of Central Lancashire in his book, The Left Case for Brexit, which says the real choice for Britain is whether we would prefer as few changes as possible, because we are happy with the status quo, or whether we would like to do things differently and therefore need the \u201cgreater policy independence that is necessary to make these changes\u201d. Whyman concedes that up until now the UK has failed to take advantage of the leeway that is currently permitted under EU law but says that economic renewal requires freedom from competition, state aid and procurement rules. The pamphlet argues for a free trade agreement with the EU to ensure maximum flexibility. \u201cBrexit can be a positive event for the left. Withdrawal from the EU offers the potential for an active government to transform our economy for our mutual benefit. Long standing weaknesses in the UK economy need to be dealt with. These include issues relating to low levels of capital formation, poor productivity growth, a large and unsustainable trade deficit, problems with the efficient operation of the labour market and the need to rebuild manufacturing industry to rebalance the UK economy.\u201d Some of the themes explored in these two books were bubbling beneath the surface of last week\u2019s Labour conference. The reluctance of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell to put the option to remain in the EU on the ballot paper in a second referendum was obvious. They fear those who voted to leave in heartland Labour seats will feel betrayed if told to have another go because they came up with the wrong answer last time. What\u2019s more, it is not so long ago that the Labour leader and the shadow chancellor were publicly expressing similar views to those of Lapavitsas. There is no obvious reason why they should have changed their minds because the events of the past few years have made one thing abundantly clear: this Europe is not for turning.

      "body": "<p>Politics was once a simple affair. On one side were the lefties, unhappy with the status quo and agitating for something different. On the other side were the conservatives, suspicious of change. When it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit,</a> though, the natural order of things has been reversed. The right has come up with all sorts of visions \u2013 most of them dystopian \u2013 of Britain\u2019s future outside the European Union. The left, for the most part, has spent its time praying for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">vote in June 2016</a> to be reversed.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. There are those on the left who understand that there was a reason people who had never voted before came out in their millions to vote for leave, and who say that something must be done for communities hollowed out by the failed policies of the past four decades. They even have a soundbite: tough on Brexit, tough on the causes of Brexit.</p> <p>Similarly, there are left-of-centre remainers who recognise that something has gone seriously wrong with the European Union. They too have a slogan: <a href=\"https://www.anothereurope.org/\">a different Europe is possible</a>.</p> <p>In reality, though, almost all the energy on the remain side has been spent on keeping the UK inside the EU come what may. There has been nothing from remainers that would suggest that they have a serious plan for tackling the symptoms of Brexit. The same applies to reform of the EU.</p> <p>A small number of people in the Labour party and in the trade union movement take a different view. For them, Brexit is to be welcomed because the EU\u2019s bias in favour of multinational capital, its hardwired monetarism and its obsession with balanced budgets means it is more Thatcherite than social democratic. For those remainers who say this is a caricature and that the EU is really about protecting labour rights and defending the interests of workers in a harsh, globalised world, left leavers have a one-word riposte: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/13/athens-and-eurozone-agree-bailout-deal-for-greece\">Greece</a>.</p> <p>Since the referendum, this group has found it hard to get a hearing as the much larger group of left remainers has dominated the conversation with warnings about how the sky will fall in after Brexit. There is nothing new in this: many of the cheerleaders for remain were making exactly the same noises years ago when the UK was deciding whether or not to join the euro.</p> <p>Yet, in recent weeks there have been two publications that have challenged the mainstream view. The Left Case Against the EU by Costas Lapavitsas, a Soas economics professor, takes issue with the idea that the EU is all about cooperation and togetherness, a borderless paradise of interrailing and Erasmus schemes.</p> <p>The EU, Lapavitsas argues, is not a nation state that the left could battle to capture and then shape the way it is run. Rather, it is a transnational juggernaut geared to neoliberalism.</p> <p>The European left\u2019s \u201cattachment to the EU as an inherently progressive development prevents it from being radical, and indeed integrates it into the neoliberal structures of European capitalism\u201d, Lapavitsas says. \u201cThe left has become increasingly cut off from its historic constituency, the workers and the poor of Europe, who have naturally sought a voice elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>This seems a pretty accurate assessment. The European left sees the EU as promoting democracy, egalitarianism and social liberalism, but the reality is somewhat different. The four pillars of the single market \u2013 free movement of goods, services, people and money \u2013 are actually the axioms of market fundamentalism, which is why <a href=\"https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107219\">Mrs Thatcher supported </a>its creation. Meanwhile, the European court of justice has gradually turned itself into a body that enforces a free-market view of the world, placing more and more restrictions on the freedom of member states to make their own economic decisions.</p> <p>This point is taken up by Philip Whyman of the University of Central Lancashire in his book, The Left Case for Brexit, which says the real choice for Britain is whether we would prefer as few changes as possible, because we are happy with the status quo, or whether we would like to do things differently and therefore need the \u201cgreater policy independence that is necessary to make these changes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whyman concedes that up until now the UK has failed to take advantage of the leeway that is currently permitted under EU law but says that economic renewal requires freedom from competition, state aid and procurement rules. The pamphlet argues for a free trade agreement with the EU to ensure maximum flexibility.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit can be a positive event for the left. Withdrawal from the EU offers the potential for an active government to transform our economy for our mutual benefit. Long standing weaknesses in the UK economy need to be dealt with. These include issues relating to low levels of capital formation, poor productivity growth, a large and unsustainable trade deficit, problems with the efficient operation of the labour market and the need to rebuild manufacturing industry to rebalance the UK economy.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the themes explored in these two books were bubbling beneath the surface of last week\u2019s Labour conference. The reluctance of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell to put the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/24/mcdonnell-new-brexit-referendum-should-not-include-remain-option\">option to remain in the EU on the ballot paper in a second referendum </a>was obvious. They fear those who voted to leave in heartland Labour seats will feel betrayed if told to have another go because they came up with the wrong answer last time. What\u2019s more, it is not so long ago that the Labour leader and the shadow chancellor were publicly expressing similar views to those of Lapavitsas. There is no obvious reason why they should have changed their minds because the events of the past few years have made one thing abundantly clear: this Europe is not for turning.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/The+Left+Case+Against+the+EU-p-9781509531080\">The </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/The+Left+Case+Against+the+EU-p-9781509531080\">Left </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/The+Left+Case+Against+the+EU-p-9781509531080\">Case </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/The+Left+Case+Against+the+EU-p-9781509531080\">Against the EU</a></em><em> by Costas </em><em>Lapavitsas; Polity</em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://civitas.org.uk/publications/the-left-case-for-brexit/\">The </a></em><em><a href=\"https://civitas.org.uk/publications/the-left-case-for-brexit/\">Left </a></em><em><a href=\"https://civitas.org.uk/publications/the-left-case-for-brexit/\">Case for Brexit</a></em><em> by Philip Whyman; Civitas</em></p></li> </ul>",

Next week the supermarket chain will celebrating the 20th anniversary of its Tesco Finest range by splashing out on a three-day \u201cexhibition you can eat\u201d. Guests are invited to \u201cstep into the effervescent world inside a bottle of Tesco Finest vintage grand cru champagne and catch edible bubbles in one of six multisensory experiences\u201d at the event in Shoreditch, London, \u201ccurated\u201d by two food alchemists. Confused? You\u2019re not the only one. But will the positive vibes be extended later this week when the chain announces its interim results? Investors and commentators will be keeping a close eye on how the company is progressing in its ambitious recovery plans when the results are released on Wednesday. Chief executive Dave Lewis aims to earn between 3.5p and 4p of operating profit for every \u00a31 that a customer spends by 2020. Some industry observers are cautiously expecting positive news from the UK\u2019s largest supermarket, though this year is seen as a stepping stone for the company. \u201cI think it will be a good update and I think Tesco will be on the front foot,\u201d said Clive Black from Shore Capital. \u201cThis is a transition year for Tesco. The business is now on the profit-growth journey. It is paying a dividend once again, but this is really a transition year towards Tesco delivering a target that Dave Lewis set in 2016.\u201d There will inevitably be chatter around the chain\u2019s high-profile new venture Jack\u2019s, the discount chain aimed at attracting back customers who have defected to Aldi and Lidl. Although a tiny part of the Tesco empire \u2013 10 to 15 stores are planned to open over the next six months \u2013 they have garnered enormous attention with the claim they are the cheapest in town. The move comes as there is huge upheaval in the UK\u2019s \u00a3117bn grocery market and the competition watchdog is examining the proposed \u00a312bn merger between Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda, which would create a retailer more powerful than Tesco. Shopper defections to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl have been so substantial that \u00a37bn less is being spent annually with the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 than a decade ago. Outside of the UK, investors will be looking at how the business is doing in central Europe, where a problem has emerged in Poland with the banning of Sunday trading. Black said there was an expectation that the Asian business would be strong, especially the Thailand operation. Further details may also emerge of an alliance between Tesco and Carrefour, Europe\u2019s largest retailer. They announced in July that they were teaming up to buy products for more than 19,000 stores. Analysts have said the planned three-year strategic alliance would squeeze suppliers further as the supermarket industry fights back against the rise of Amazon and the discounters. Also this week, the retrial is expected to begin of Christopher Bush and John Scouler, former directors of Tesco\u2019s UK business who are charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. They deny the charges. So it\u2019s a busy period for Tesco, but at least staff will be able to kick back and celebrate at the edible exhibition. \u201cFrom venturing down a Himalayan salt mine to embarking on a foraging expedition to play a wild mushroom symphony and seeing the unimaginable come to life with an edible rainbow, the multisensory taste journey will take diners through a whole meal, from aperitifs to starters through to main and dessert,\u201d says the blurb.",

      "bodyText": "Labor has vowed to deliver a bigger budget surplus than the government, while following the budget \u201crule\u201d of offsetting any new spending commitments through corresponding budget savings, with Chris Bowen accusing Scott Morrison of \u201cjust throwing money at political problems\u201d. The governments solution to the Catholic school funding issue, promising $4.6bn for the non-government school sector, will see $1.1bn spent in the next four years, which affects the current budget forward estimates. In announcing the deal, Morrison did not commit to any spending cuts, but instead referred to the growing economy and increased revenue as being able to pay for it, with the increased spending to be \u201creconciled\u201d in the coming midyear economic and fiscal outlook. Spending yet-to-be confirmed revenue growth to cover new funding promises, rather than cutting from established government spending, is a departure from the budget rule \u2013 that spending be offset from commensurate savings. When asked if he would remain committed to that rule, Morrison said there were \u201cexceptions\u201d. \u201cAs with the rules in the past, where there are exceptions to the rules, the government reserves the right to exercise that discretion,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cBut they are the rules. When ministers bring forward proposals, they are required to bring them forward with offsets.\u201d Speaking to Sky, the shadow treasurer said the government had moved the goal posts. \u201cThey\u2019ve thrown away the debt and deficit disaster and budget emergency, and are just throwing money at their political problems,\u201d he said. \u201cOur approach is more than just one fiscal rule, it\u2019s a multitude of fiscal rules to ensure that discipline.\u201d Bowen said with considerable risk still present in global financial markets, Australia needed to play it fiscally safe. \u201cWe\u2019ve got considerable potential for international economic down tide,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world economy is very benign at the moment for Australia, it\u2019s going very well. \u201cBut there\u2019s significant risk out there. Australia\u2019s household debt is very high. Confirmed during the week by the Bank of International Settlements as the second highest in the OECD. \u201cThat provides, without being alarmist, for considerable risk in the Australian economy. \u201cSo the time for fiscal discipline and rigour continues. \u201cJosh Frydenberg has thrown away the rule book in his first couple of weeks as treasurer. Well I have a different approach. I believe in bigger budget surpluses and that requires those fiscal rules to be adhered to.\u201d Morrison and Frydenberg are expected to make more funding announcements ahead of December\u2019s Myefo briefing, as they seek to position the government in an election-winning position. GST top-ups for Western Australia have already been pledged, with Morrison looking to cement WA seats at risk of falling to Labor at the next federal poll. Having all but abandoned its unpopular corporate tax cut plan, the next economic battle ground between the two parties is expected to be waged over the business sector, with the government expected to switch its focus to small and medium businesses instead. Bowen said the government looked to be playing \u201ccatch-up\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve seen also speculation that the government is considering an instant asset write-off, an upfront deduction, immediate expensing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already announced the Australian Investment Guarantee. So if they want to play catch-up with us on that, that\u2019s great. We\u2019ve announced 20% upfront deductions for every business big or small. Multinational or Australian-focused, providing they invest in Australia, providing the investment is coming. \u201cThat\u2019s the condition of which Labor has attached to that.\u201d But he added Labor would not respond until an actual policy was put forward. \u201cWith this government, with due respect, policies change between 10am and lunchtime,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to respond to every thought bubble, every bit of speculation. When we see a concrete policy announcement from the government you will see a considered response from Labor and the economic team.\u201d",
