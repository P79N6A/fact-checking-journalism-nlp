    "webTitle": "Anger over executive pay  boils over as boards face a 'shareholder spring'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For Catherine Howarth, \"it's been a totally fabulous week\". The chief executive of campaign group Fair Pensions, which has long toiled to persuade City investors to rein in the worst excesses of British listed companies, the unprecedented wave of investor rebellions over recent days represents nothing less than a revolution. \"There's this really long history of shareholders being unwilling to use the powers they have. The fact that this is changing at the moment is really something to celebrate,\" she says. Paul Hewitt of investor lobby group Manifest describes it as a \"shareholder spring\". Just weeks after the Occupy protesters were chucked out of the City, the sharp-suited fund managers who picked their way through the tents to get to their desks each morning have staged their own protest against fat-cat capitalism. On Thursday alone, five companies felt the wrath of investors and suffered revolts over their pay policies. For Aviva, the insurance company, the rebuke was so strong that more than half its investors rejected its remuneration report in protest at pay for underperformance, particularly in respect of chief executive Andrew Moss. The revolts followed a string of protests at companies as diverse as Barclays and mining company Xstrata. Shareholders' fury has not just been directed against remuneration reports, but also against individuals. Sly Bailey has fallen on her sword at Trinity Mirror, and even a boardroom veteran such as Alison Carnwath has not been immune. More than one in five investors voted against Carnwath's re-election to the board of Barclays as chair of the remuneration committee that nodded through Bob Diamond's pay; and she also faced a revolt at hedge fund Man Group, where investors feel she has been involved for too long to be truly independent. Advertising giant WPP and bookie William Hill also face protests. Several factors have come together to make 2012 the most stormy annual meeting season in living memory. One is the government's vocal determination to tackle \"rewards for failure\". Business secretary Vince Cable has proposed radical reforms, including giving shareholders a binding vote on pay, rather than the advisory vote introduced by Labour, and forcing companies to disclose pay deals for departing directors. Some of the measures have been fiercely criticised by business groups, including the CBI; but he is expected to stick to his guns when he publishes final proposals next month. The grim economic backdrop and the pessimistic public mood has also thrown some of the lavish rewards for top executives into sharp relief. George Dallas, director of corporate governance at fund manager F&amp;C, says bumper pay packets have come under increased public pressure because many families are facing declining living standards. \"There is a lot of austerity going round and the taxpayer is still feeling that the crisis hasn't gone away,\" he says. A third factor driving the \"shareholder spring\" has been a concerted campaign by groups such as Fair Pensions, trades unions and green groups. They have worked to persuade small shareholders, including retail investors and workers with pensions or insurance funds \u2013 who between them hold billions of pounds' worth of shares \u2013 to ask how their money is being invested and demand a more active approach. Jenny Cramer's husband had often told her to stop shouting at the TV and get out and do something \u2013 so when her mother left her a few shares, she decided to exercise her right to go along to the AGMs of AstraZeneca and Barclays. \"I thought it was astonishing that one was able to address these people who are sitting up on the stage,\" she says. She argues that making the voices of shareholders heard is essential to cracking the culture of excess. \"They've been doing this since the 1980s \u2013 granting themselves larger and larger bonuses, and they all come from the same pool.\" At the hostile Aviva meeting, too, bosses were forced to confront furious private shareholders. Anthony George, who has been an Aviva shareholder for 40 years, deplored the fact that pensioners, who along with many small shareholders depend on Aviva for their income, had \"suffered because of the bad decisions Aviva have made\". Howarth insists that growing pressure on City fund managers from their clients has helped to change the climate. \"At the end of the day, investment management firms are commercial organisations; they compete for business,\" she says. However, some of those in the City who have been trying to promote shareholder activism for many years warn that high-profile protest votes like those of the past fortnight are a sign that the relationship between shareholders and executives has broken down. Colin Melvin, chief executive of Hermes Equity Ownership Services, which prides itself on its level of dialogue with companies, says: \"In some ways, a no vote is a sign of failure. What we've seen is an apparent increase in activism and we need to be careful we don't confuse this with long-term stewardship.\" Lord Myners, former Labour City minister and once the head of a fund management firm himself, says the boiling-over of investors' frustration is a symptom of a deeper crisis in the way Britain's companies are run. \"I think what we're seeing is institutional shareholders beginning to ask questions about the people who sit on boards to represent their interests, namely the independent directors,\" he says. \"The reality is that most non-executive directors are appointed by the chairman.\" He says shareholders rarely even get the chance to meet the non-executives, who are meant to make sure the shareholders' perspective is represented. Myners advocates the Scandinavian approach, in which shareholders sit on the nomination committees that choose new directors, ensuring the board cannot be packed with the chairman's cronies. \"Instead, we have the North Korean model, in which each candidate is re-elected every year, and 99.99% of them get voted in with 99.99% of the vote.\" Peter Butler, chief executive of fund manager Governance for Owners, says that battles over pay, though they capture the public mood, can mask other, more fundamental problems at firms. \"There are so many huge problems with corporate companies, yet all we're having is a standoff about what directors pay themselves when the focus should be on the bigger problems.\" Whatever the causes of this revolution, now that investors have started to exercise their rights, they will want to see results. Robert Talbut, chief investment office at Royal London Asset Management, argues that the dissent has been caused not by communication issues \u2013 as suggested by Barclays and Aviva \u2013 but because of growing concerns about the link between salaries and returns. \"The more active approach reflects a cumulative building of concerns regarding returns to shareholder in the difficult economic times and whether there was a strong enough linkage between pay and performance. This should not be read as a sudden, kneejerk reaction by shareholders,\" he says. If he's right, the \"shareholder spring\" could just be the beginning of a more complex, and perhaps more stormy, relationship between shareholders and executives. Myners believes the ructions will continue until top executives start to understand what is going on in the real world, far beyond the boardroom. \"Certainly, the 'we're all in it together' message does not seem to have got to directors or remuneration committees,\" he says.",

      "standfirst": "The anger that investors have shown at so many AGMs shows that soaring executive pay is finally becoming unacceptable", 
      "body": "<p>The first of May is traditionally international workers' day, when the proletariat unite to bring the bosses down a peg or two. But last week it was City shareholders \u2013 not known for manning barricades \u2013 who turned on their own.</p> <p>Aviva's management faced the worst slap in the face, with almost 60% of shareholders refusing to support the pay package of chief executive Andrew Moss. But this was only the latest milestone in what has been the most controversial AGM season anyone in the Square Mile can remember. Barclays, Inmarsat and Capital Shopping Centres \u2013 as well as, outside the UK, Citigroup and UBS \u2013 have all faced substantial rebellions.</p> <p>Whether because they are finally waking up to the fact that bumper pay packets do not necessarily deliver top-drawer performance, or because they know the government is breathing down their necks, shareholders seem to have discovered their backbones.</p> <p>Their rebelliousness is to be warmly welcomed. For too long, the fund managers and insurers who manage billions of pounds' worth of investments have regarded a quiet word at the Chelsea flower show as the limit of their duties with regard to monitoring executives of companies they own.</p> <p>Vince Cable's bid to give shareholders more power, by possibly raising to 75% the threshold for approval of corporate pay policies and giving shareholders a binding vote on pay, will help.</p> <p>An explanation given by some for their new-found activism is that they would like to fend off fresh legislation by demonstrating to Cable \u2013 and No 10, which is known to take a close interest in the policy \u2013 that they have the guts to rein in corporate excess without help from politicians.

      "bodyText": "The first of May is traditionally international workers' day, when the proletariat unite to bring the bosses down a peg or two. But last week it was City shareholders \u2013 not known for manning barricades \u2013 who turned on their own. Aviva's management faced the worst slap in the face, with almost 60% of shareholders refusing to support the pay package of chief executive Andrew Moss. But this was only the latest milestone in what has been the most controversial AGM season anyone in the Square Mile can remember. Barclays, Inmarsat and Capital Shopping Centres \u2013 as well as, outside the UK, Citigroup and UBS \u2013 have all faced substantial rebellions. Whether because they are finally waking up to the fact that bumper pay packets do not necessarily deliver top-drawer performance, or because they know the government is breathing down their necks, shareholders seem to have discovered their backbones. Their rebelliousness is to be warmly welcomed. For too long, the fund managers and insurers who manage billions of pounds' worth of investments have regarded a quiet word at the Chelsea flower show as the limit of their duties with regard to monitoring executives of companies they own. Vince Cable's bid to give shareholders more power, by possibly raising to 75% the threshold for approval of corporate pay policies and giving shareholders a binding vote on pay, will help. An explanation given by some for their new-found activism is that they would like to fend off fresh legislation by demonstrating to Cable \u2013 and No 10, which is known to take a close interest in the policy \u2013 that they have the guts to rein in corporate excess without help from politicians. But Cable should be emboldened by the fact that, with this new mood in the air, the extra powers he wants to hand to investors will hit overpaid bosses where it hurts. Shareholders cannot fix the fat-cat culture on their own, though. The excesses that took root in banks, and spread to scores of other sectors in the past two decades, have been upheld not just by supine shareholders, but by the structure and make-up of boards, and by pay consultants who recommend ever-rising rewards. As one example of another lever Cable could pull, John Kay's recent report about encouraging long-termism \u2013 his full findings are due later in the year \u2013 suggested a rethink of the cult of quarterly reporting.

But the events of the past two weeks suggest that the appetite is growing for what David Cameron calls \"responsible capitalism\". Centrica's turn to feel the heat The proverbial heat will be turned up again over executive pay at British Gas's parent group, Centrica, which comes face to face with its \"owners\" on Friday. Sam Laidlaw, the old Etonian who runs the power business, has just received a rather hot remuneration deal potentially worth \u00a34.3m last year at a time when fuel poverty among households is soaring. Admittedly, much of that came from payouts under long-term performance-related deals going back to 2008. But it looks pretty excessive in a year when operating profits fell by half, and will play badly out in a wider world where some householders are having to spend more than 10% of their total income just trying to pay the heating bill. The board has tried to head off criticism by freezing executive salaries for 2012, introducing extra criteria under which executive \"success\" will be judged and bringing in a clawback mechanism for deferred bonuses. But don't expect the AGM to be a love-in. The biggest of the Big Six energy companies, like its rivals, is still in the sin-bin of public opinion. Responsibility for rising fuel poverty, high energy bills, and a failure to invest fast enough in a low-carbon power agenda will be some of the volatile issues raised by shareholders \u2013 at least, those who belong to various charities and non-governmental organisations who will have bought tickets (sorry, shares) for the meeting. The atmosphere around all the Big Six companies has been further inflamed by Scottish &amp; Southern Energy picking up a \u00a31.25m fine on Friday for allowing its doorstep salesmen to mislead customers into thinking they would get a better energy deal by switching to that company. British Gas was itself fined \u00a31m last July by energy regulator Ofgem for misreporting how much electricity it supplied. The same month, the Centrica subsidiary was fined a record \u00a32.5m for mishandling complaints when Ofgem found it had failed to properly investigate cases of unhappy customers. Those with long memories will remember the British Gas annual meeting of 1995, when the unions turned up at the venue with a live pig in a bid to symbolise how the company's then boss, Cedric Brown, had his head in the pay trough.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The idea of the governor of the Bank of England shouting \"from the rooftops\" is one that I love. This is what he said, in his BBC Today programme lecture last week, that he and his colleagues should have been doing before the financial crisis. The thought of the gently spoken Sir Mervyn King bellowing from the roof of the Bank, possibly with a megaphone \u2013 do we still manufacture them, I wonder? \u2013 is an intriguing one. King went some way to admitting culpability, and even contrition, in conceding that the fashionable view \u2013 that controlling inflation was enough to secure stability \u2013 was misguided. \"With the benefit of hindsight,\" he said, \"we should have shouted from the rooftops that a system had been built in which banks were too important to fail, that banks had grown too quickly and borrowed too much, and that so-called 'light touch' regulation hadn't prevented any of this.\" The governor admitted the Bank should have done \"more to prevent the disaster\" but then complained: \"The power to regulate banks had been taken away from us \u2026 Our power was limited to that of publishing reports and preaching sermons.\" The irony here of course is that the main reason why that power had been removed from the Bank was that both in the case of Johnson Matthey and BCCI, the Bank had shouldered the blame for supervisory failings. Indeed, at one stage during his chancellorship, my old friend Nigel Lawson considered removing the Bank's powers \u2013 a decade before Gordon Brown and Ed Balls acted in 1997. The power to regulate may have been taken away. But the responsibility for financial stability was still there. And no objective observer can avoid reaching the conclusion that the Bank ran down its resources in this area and took its eye off the ball. Now, in his interview with Evan Davis on the Today programme the following day, King referred to the importance of financial history, and the fact that banking crises had not been unknown in the past. The blame game will go on and on. Alistair Darling had criticised King's performance during the crisis, and King has told us what he thinks of the 1997 structure. But for this observer, the key historical fact is that, in response to the Great Depression of 1929 onwards, strong regulatory structures were set up on both sides of the Atlantic, and it was widely accepted, including by former opponents of Keynes such as Lord Robbins, that fiscal tightening was the wrong response to such a crisis. Well, on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1980s and 1990s, deregulation became the name of the game; Alan Greenspan was almost deified; and the Greenspan doctrine \u2013 that financial engineering spread and virtually eliminated risk \u2013 was widely accepted. King argues that if, as some of his critics now say, the Bank had acted more aggressively on the interest-rate front \u2013 when many were urging it to be more dovish \u2013 then growth would have been slower and unemployment higher. He also maintains that this was \"a bust without a boom\". Brown will be delighted to hear this, because he is saddled with the memory of his promise to abolish boom and bust. I suspect that what lies behind the governor's point is that the Brown boom (or no boom) was much less spectacular than the Lawson boom of the 1980s. But King's point that a more aggressive interest rate policy would have been unpopular brings us back to Sir Edward Heath's famous remark about Lawson, when it was still the chancellor who decided interest rates: \"In golfing terms, the chancellor could be described as a one-club man, and that club is interest rates,\" said Heath, adding, \"but if one wishes to take on Sandy Lyle and the rest of the world, one needs a complete bag of clubs.\" In the 1960s and 70s, strict capital reserve and liquidity ratios were applied to banks, and there was a panoply of sensible rules limiting the taking-on of excessive risks in mortgage lending. The authorities had a whole bag of policy clubs \u2013 but the lessons of history were forgotten and the rest of the clubs were thrown away. There is a big debate now on the need for what is known as macroprudential regulation, and the form it should take. The basic point is that policymakers need more clubs. They also need more houses \u2013 not for themselves: they usually have very nice ones of their own \u2013 but for the homeless. One of the main reasons for the house price boom \u2013 and that was a boom \u2013 was Britain's chronic housing shortage. This is a national disgrace, and both the Conservative governments of Thatcher and Major, and the New Labour governments of Blair and Brown, were woefully negligent, especially in the sphere of social housing. King maintains that \"despite efforts to stimulate the economy, the recovery is proving slower than we had hoped\". Well, I fear that the fiscal lesson of the 1930s has not been learned. Current fiscal policy is not calculated to stimulate the economy. Quite the reverse. Things were going well under Darling's chancellorship, then thrown into reverse by George Osborne. Darling and Balls have been proved right, as the latest GDP figures show. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research states in its April review: \"It remains our view that fiscal policy could be used to raise aggregate demand in the economy with little to no loss of fiscal credibility.\" Hear, hear.",

      "body": "<p>Investment guru Warren Buffett has defended his proposal to tax the super rich at his annual general meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.</p> <p>President Barack Obama has trumpeted the so-called \"Buffett rule\", which would introduce a flat-rate tax on those with the very highest incomes.</p> <p>Buffett, the world's third richest man, said: \"When we are asking for shared sacrifice from the American people, I would at least make sure that the people with these huge incomes get taxed at a rate that is commensurate with the rate they got taxed at not long ago.\"</p> <p>Buffett said he had calculated that he paid the lowest tax rate in his office. \"There are people like me with huge incomes \u2026 I don't have tax planning, I don't have Swiss bank accounts,\" he said. And yet, he added, his tax rate was around 17% while the average was somewhere around 30%.</p> <p>Buffett said he was paying a rate similar to his cleaning lady. \"My wife wants this explained. She does not have a cleaning lady \u2013 it's the cleaning lady at the office,\" he added.</p> <p>Buffett said there were at least three years when he was paying the lowest tax rate in the Berkshire offices despite making anywhere from $25m to $65m.</p> <p>The Buffett rule \u2013 which would impose a tax surcharge on incomes over $1m \u2013 has been condemned by Obama's critics, including Mitt Romney. \"Someone calculated that the taxes he [Obama] would raise in his Buffett rule would pay for 11 hours of government,\" Romney said recently.</p> <p>Earlier this year it was revealed that the presumptive White House challenger paid just 14% in tax on earnings of $21.6m in 2010.</p> <p>One shareholder asked \u2013 to a round of applause \u2013 if Buffett should be making political statements, and said one investor he knew had been put off investing in Berkshire by Buffett'ss stance on taxes.</p> <p>\"I don't think any employee in Berkshire should have their citizenship restricted,\" Buffett said, in a nod to his own freedom to speak his mind.</p> <p>He added of the dissenting voice in the audience: \"It's fine if they disagree with us, [although] I think it's kind of silly. It sound to me like he ought to own Fox.\"</p> <p>Buffett also used the meeting to reassure investors that cancer will not shorten his career.</p> <p>About 35,000 people descended on Omaha this weekend to see the multi-billionaire investor deliver his annual address at the shareholder meeting for his investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway.

      "bodyText": "Investment guru Warren Buffett has defended his proposal to tax the super rich at his annual general meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. President Barack Obama has trumpeted the so-called \"Buffett rule\", which would introduce a flat-rate tax on those with the very highest incomes. Buffett, the world's third richest man, said: \"When we are asking for shared sacrifice from the American people, I would at least make sure that the people with these huge incomes get taxed at a rate that is commensurate with the rate they got taxed at not long ago.\" Buffett said he had calculated that he paid the lowest tax rate in his office. \"There are people like me with huge incomes \u2026 I don't have tax planning, I don't have Swiss bank accounts,\" he said. And yet, he added, his tax rate was around 17% while the average was somewhere around 30%. Buffett said he was paying a rate similar to his cleaning lady. \"My wife wants this explained. She does not have a cleaning lady \u2013 it's the cleaning lady at the office,\" he added. Buffett said there were at least three years when he was paying the lowest tax rate in the Berkshire offices despite making anywhere from $25m to $65m. The Buffett rule \u2013 which would impose a tax surcharge on incomes over $1m \u2013 has been condemned by Obama's critics, including Mitt Romney. \"Someone calculated that the taxes he [Obama] would raise in his Buffett rule would pay for 11 hours of government,\" Romney said recently. Earlier this year it was revealed that the presumptive White House challenger paid just 14% in tax on earnings of $21.6m in 2010. One shareholder asked \u2013 to a round of applause \u2013 if Buffett should be making political statements, and said one investor he knew had been put off investing in Berkshire by Buffett'ss stance on taxes. \"I don't think any employee in Berkshire should have their citizenship restricted,\" Buffett said, in a nod to his own freedom to speak his mind. He added of the dissenting voice in the audience: \"It's fine if they disagree with us, [although] I think it's kind of silly. It sound to me like he ought to own Fox.\" Buffett also used the meeting to reassure investors that cancer will not shorten his career. About 35,000 people descended on Omaha this weekend to see the multi-billionaire investor deliver his annual address at the shareholder meeting for his investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway. Bill Gates and Bono were in the audience at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha. Among shareholders, Buffett's health was a major concern.. Last month Buffett announced that he had early-stage prostate cancer. He said he was told by his doctors that his condition \"is not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way\". \"I feel real good,\" Buffett said on a walkabout before the meeting opened this morning. The first question asked at the meeting was about succession. Earlier this year Buffett announced that an individual had been chosen to take over for him when he can no longer handle the chief executive duties, but he didn't say who that was. Buffett joked that he wasn't \"an arts major\" and said that the candidate was capable of doing \"many things better than I can.\" Asked if his successor could broker the same kinds of deals that have made Buffett so successful, Buffett said \"not every deal that I've made\" could be done by his successor.
