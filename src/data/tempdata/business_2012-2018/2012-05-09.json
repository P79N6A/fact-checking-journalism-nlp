      "bodyText": "Spain's conservative government partly nationalised the country's fourth-largest bank, Bankia, after investors dumped Spanish bonds and stocks amid increasing worries about the country's banking sector. Under the deal, \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.6bn) in government loans given to Bankia over the past two years will be turned into shares in the group's parent company, the finance ministry said. That will give the state 45% of the shares and, effectively, full control. \"It is a necessary first step to ensure solvency, the tranquility of the depositors and to dispel the doubts of the markets on the capital needs of the entity,\" the finance ministry said. Bankia has more than \u20ac30bn of exposure to troubled loans to property developers and repossessed land and buildings. The government is expected to lend or give Bankia up to \u20ac10bn aid overall, although some analysts say it will need more. Earlier in the day, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, dodged questions about nationalisation but said a slew of banking reforms later this week would \"help solve a lot of Spain's problems\". His words came as jitters about banks drove the Madrid stock market to an eight-year low, while yields on benchmark 10-year Spanish sovereign bonds soared back over the key 6% level. The nationalisation comes as Spain is seen as the biggest worry in the troubled eurozone, with the country suffering a second recession in three years and 24% unemployment. The measure is further proof that Spain's banking sector has failed to digest a huge pile of toxic assets and debt left over by a property bubble that burst four years ago. There have been suggestions that it will need help from the eurozone's rescue fund to tackle the problem. Extra reforms will include yet another round of provisioning against toxic real estate with banks ordered to set aside a further \u20ac35bn on top of the \u20ac54bn already provided, financial sources told Reuters. Bankia was created just 17 months ago by the merger of seven regional savings banks in an attempt to shore up their combined defences against the bad real estate loans, worthless building land and unsold apartment blocks they had accumulated. Savings banks, many controlled by local politicians, were the most reckless lenders to developers, land speculators and building companies, which have left Spanish banks burdened with \u20ac184bn of problem loans and assets.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Errol Damelin, who says he understands why the lender inspires so much wrath, aims to improve children's financial literacy", 
      "body": "<p>Wonga, the controversial high-cost, short-term lender, is planning to offer a&#xa0;wider range of financial services, including savings, this year.</p> <p>Errol Damelin, co-founder of the company, said banks performed an important role in providing a safe place to deposit money and carry out transactions, but added: \"We want to innovate around the edges of that and add value. We think we can. We think there are some places where technology can be used to deliver much better service.\"</p> <p>And, in a move that may alarm parents, Wonga is intending to get involved with improving financial literacy for children this year, doing something \"innovative and educational\" in a digital capacity, says Damelin.</p> <p>\"Kids need to know what all the credit alternatives are and equally they should know about saving.\"</p> <p>Wonga launched just over four years ago with one product \u2013 a short-term loan for consumers which could be approved within 15 minutes and delivered into the applicant's bank account within half an hour. It has since advanced 4m loans, worth \u00a31bn, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/07/wonga-launches-business-loans-service\" title=\"\">launched into the small-business loans market</a> earlier this week.</p> <p>Damelin likens the company's development to that of Amazon, which \"started with books, but it's not just selling books now. The end point for us is being a really meaningful, relevant business in financial services. It's being the Amazon of financial services.\"</p> <p>However, Damelin would not reveal what new services he has planned and a sticking point could be that the company does not have the banking licence which it would need to take deposits. The Financial Services Authority says it takes nine months on average to approve applications.</p> <p>Wonga has attracted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/01/wonga-real-cost-payday-loan?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">considerable criticism for the high cost of its consumer loans</a>, for which it charges 4,214% annual representative rate (APR). The risk-based interest rates on its small-business loans range from 16.6% equivalent annual rate (EAR) to 109% EAR, substantially higher than the rates charged on small-business loans provided by banks or peer-to-peer lenders.</p> <p>However, Damelin claims critics are wrong to focus on cost, and that for small-business owners, speed, availability and complexity are often more important. Likewise for retail consumers, price often isn't the main determinant: \"You don't always buy the cheapest [cooking] oil, or the cheapest shoes.\"</p> <p>He even blames the \"obsession\" with pricing as one of the causes of the credit crunch, saying \"there has been a nuclear arms race to the bottom on pricing\". This has been to the detriment of cash-strapped consumers, who have ended up subsidising current account banking for wealthier customers.</p> <p>Damelin appears quite calm when asked if he understands why Wonga is so vilified, and inspires so much wrath among Guardian readers in particular for making money out of people on low incomes. \"I understand the concerns that people have with credit providers in general. One of the reasons I started the business was because I share many of the concerns that people have.</p> <p>\"But we do, as a society, want access to credit delivered in a responsible way \u2026 There's real demand from people \u2013 and businesses \u2013 for help in spreading the costs that they incur. Without that ability, then you might not have the opportunity for anybody who isn't very wealthy to get access to things like education, fixing a car that breaks down or entertainment.\"</p> <p>He says he does \"have issues\" with how a lot of companies in the short-term lending industry, which includes pawnbrokers, payday and doorstep lenders, lend money. These include a lack of transparency on costs and terms, the rolling over of loans, resulting in the borrower owing huge amounts, and keeping people in permanent debt.</p> <p>He's not the only one \u2013 the 200 firms which comprise the short-term, high-cost lending industry are now the subject of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/feb/24/payday-loan-firms-investigated-oft\" title=\"\">ongoing investigation by the Office of Fair Trading</a>.</p> <p>Damelin believes the quality of short-term lending could immediately be improved if lenders provided the main credit reference agencies, Experian, Equifax and Callcredit, with details of loans and customers. This would enable the lenders to share data and immediately identify if someone was borrowing beyond their ability to repay. Wonga turns down two-thirds of applicants after its computer systems have analysed around 8,000 pieces of data to assess their ability to repay.</p> <p>Wonga advertises prolifically, spending an estimated \u00a316m in 2011. It sponsors all three CSI series and The Mentalist on Channel 5, using the Rawhide theme tune for its commercial radio ads, and plastering buses throughout London. Damelin denies that the pensioner puppets used for its TV promotions are helping to sanitise an industry that has been described by one MP as \"legal loan sharking\".</p> <p>The company sponsors Blackpool and Heart of Midlothian football teams and advertises on football clubs' websites, leading one Northampton Town fan to start a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/mar/28/football-fans-removal-wonga-ads-club-websites?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">campaign for its ads to be removed</a>.</p> <p>It has earned opprobrium from parents for running its adverts during children's programmes. One Guardian reader wrote: \"Amid the ads for children's toys was a totally cynical ad aimed at hard-pressed parents for the loan company Wonga.com. [Its APR] is the kind of figure likely to propel the most disadvantaged families into the arms of the debt collectors, and perhaps even into homelessness. I suppose it is legal for them to advertise this on children's TV, but I'm sure it shouldn't be.\"</p> <p>Damelin pointed out that children could not apply for loans, but added: \"It's important that kids get educated about credit. I think they are hiding people from the reality that credit is a really important part of society \u2026 It's just naive in this day and age to think that people don't need to know about credit.</p> <p>Wonga claims, probably quite correctly, that many consumers are confused over the pricing of credit and savings interest, having little or no understanding of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/oct/25/debt.savings\" title=\"\">annual percentage rates (APR) or equivalent annual rates</a>, while some of the most expensive forms of borrowing including overdrafts need not display these measures at all.</p> <p>Damelin believes APR and EARs should be scrapped and a single measure introduced allowing borrowers to compare products on a like for like basis, rather like the unit prices used in supermarkets to describe how much 100ml of olive oil or 100g of chocolate cost.</p> <p>He points to the company's net promoter score \u2014 a measure of customer satisfaction developed by Harvard Business School. This asks how likely are you to recommend this service to a friend or family, allowing a company track its own performance over time and to compare itself against peers. Damelin said: \"Most of the banks in the UK are negative. The Co-op has a score in the 20s while First Direct has one in the 40s \u2014 that's a good number. Wonga, at 73%, is in Google and Apple territory, and most of the time we're ahead of these guys.\"</p>",

Errol Damelin, co-founder of the company, said banks performed an important role in providing a safe place to deposit money and carry out transactions, but added: \"We want to innovate around the edges of that and add value. We think we can. We think there are some places where technology can be used to deliver much better service.\" And, in a move that may alarm parents, Wonga is intending to get involved with improving financial literacy for children this year, doing something \"innovative and educational\" in a digital capacity, says Damelin. \"Kids need to know what all the credit alternatives are and equally they should know about saving.\" Wonga launched just over four years ago with one product \u2013 a short-term loan for consumers which could be approved within 15 minutes and delivered into the applicant's bank account within half an hour. It has since advanced 4m loans, worth \u00a31bn, and launched into the small-business loans market earlier this week. Damelin likens the company's development to that of Amazon, which \"started with books, but it's not just selling books now. The end point for us is being a really meaningful, relevant business in financial services. It's being the Amazon of financial services.\" However, Damelin would not reveal what new services he has planned and a sticking point could be that the company does not have the banking licence which it would need to take deposits. The Financial Services Authority says it takes nine months on average to approve applications. Wonga has attracted considerable criticism for the high cost of its consumer loans, for which it charges 4,214% annual representative rate (APR). The risk-based interest rates on its small-business loans range from 16.6% equivalent annual rate (EAR) to 109% EAR, substantially higher than the rates charged on small-business loans provided by banks or peer-to-peer lenders. However, Damelin claims critics are wrong to focus on cost, and that for small-business owners, speed, availability and complexity are often more important. Likewise for retail consumers, price often isn't the main determinant: \"You don't always buy the cheapest [cooking] oil, or the cheapest shoes.\" He even blames the \"obsession\" with pricing as one of the causes of the credit crunch, saying \"there has been a nuclear arms race to the bottom on pricing\". This has been to the detriment of cash-strapped consumers, who have ended up subsidising current account banking for wealthier customers. Damelin appears quite calm when asked if he understands why Wonga is so vilified, and inspires so much wrath among Guardian readers in particular for making money out of people on low incomes. \"I understand the concerns that people have with credit providers in general. One of the reasons I started the business was because I share many of the concerns that people have. \"But we do, as a society, want access to credit delivered in a responsible way \u2026 There's real demand from people \u2013 and businesses \u2013 for help in spreading the costs that they incur. Without that ability, then you might not have the opportunity for anybody who isn't very wealthy to get access to things like education, fixing a car that breaks down or entertainment.\" He says he does \"have issues\" with how a lot of companies in the short-term lending industry, which includes pawnbrokers, payday and doorstep lenders, lend money. These include a lack of transparency on costs and terms, the rolling over of loans, resulting in the borrower owing huge amounts, and keeping people in permanent debt. He's not the only one \u2013 the 200 firms which comprise the short-term, high-cost lending industry are now the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Office of Fair Trading. Damelin believes the quality of short-term lending could immediately be improved if lenders provided the main credit reference agencies, Experian, Equifax and Callcredit, with details of loans and customers. This would enable the lenders to share data and immediately identify if someone was borrowing beyond their ability to repay. Wonga turns down two-thirds of applicants after its computer systems have analysed around 8,000 pieces of data to assess their ability to repay. Wonga advertises prolifically, spending an estimated \u00a316m in 2011. It sponsors all three CSI series and The Mentalist on Channel 5, using the Rawhide theme tune for its commercial radio ads, and plastering buses throughout London. Damelin denies that the pensioner puppets used for its TV promotions are helping to sanitise an industry that has been described by one MP as \"legal loan sharking\". The company sponsors Blackpool and Heart of Midlothian football teams and advertises on football clubs' websites, leading one Northampton Town fan to start a campaign for its ads to be removed. It has earned opprobrium from parents for running its adverts during children's programmes. One Guardian reader wrote: \"Amid the ads for children's toys was a totally cynical ad aimed at hard-pressed parents for the loan company Wonga.com. [Its APR] is the kind of figure likely to propel the most disadvantaged families into the arms of the debt collectors, and perhaps even into homelessness. I suppose it is legal for them to advertise this on children's TV, but I'm sure it shouldn't be.\" Damelin pointed out that children could not apply for loans, but added: \"It's important that kids get educated about credit. I think they are hiding people from the reality that credit is a really important part of society \u2026 It's just naive in this day and age to think that people don't need to know about credit. Wonga claims, probably quite correctly, that many consumers are confused over the pricing of credit and savings interest, having little or no understanding of annual percentage rates (APR) or equivalent annual rates, while some of the most expensive forms of borrowing including overdrafts need not display these measures at all. Damelin believes APR and EARs should be scrapped and a single measure introduced allowing borrowers to compare products on a like for like basis, rather like the unit prices used in supermarkets to describe how much 100ml of olive oil or 100g of chocolate cost. He points to the company's net promoter score \u2014 a measure of customer satisfaction developed by Harvard Business School. This asks how likely are you to recommend this service to a friend or family, allowing a company track its own performance over time and to compare itself against peers. Damelin said: \"Most of the banks in the UK are negative. The Co-op has a score in the 20s while First Direct has one in the 40s \u2014 that's a good number. Wonga, at 73%, is in Google and Apple territory, and most of the time we're ahead of these guys.\"",

      "bodyText": "Spain's government is poised to partly nationalise the country's fourth-largest bank, Bankia, according to reports in the Madrid press, as investors dumped Spanish bonds and stocks amid increasing worries about the country's banking sector. Bankia's board was meeting on Wednesday night, with reports that new chairman Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Goirigolzarri would ask the government to take control of the troubled bank as it sinks under a mountain of toxic real estate assets. It was unclear how that would happen, however, with reports that the government would convert a \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.6bn) loan to the banking group's parent company, BFA, into shares. Other estimates see the bank needing \u20ac10bn. Jitters about banks drove the Madrid stock market to an eight year low, while yields on benchmark 10-year Spanish sovereign bonds soared back over the key 6% level. The selloff was further proof that Spain has become the main worry in the troubled eurozone as the country suffers a second recession in three years and unemployment hits 24%. The Bankia debacle showed how Spain's banking sector has failed to digest the pile of toxic assets and debt left over by a property bubble that burst four years ago. There have been suggestions that it will need help from the eurozone's rescue fund to tackle the problem. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy dodged questions on Bankia saying only that reforms to be announced by Friday will \"will help solve a lot of Spain's economic problems\". Those reforms will include yet another round of provisioning against toxic real estate with banks ordered to set aside a further \u20ac35bn on top of the \u20ac54bn they are already provisioning, financial sources told Reuters. Bankia was created just 17 months ago by the merger of seven regional savings banks in an attempt to shore up their combined defences against the bad real estate loans, worthless building land and unsold apartment blocks they had accumulated. Saving banks, many controlled by local politicians, were the most reckless lenders to developers, land speculators and building companies, which have left Spanish banks burdened with \u20ac184bn of problem loans and assets. Alberto Garz\u00f3n, a deputy for the communist-led United Left party, warned Rajoy against using public money to nationalise only the Bankia group's separate \"bad bank\" \u2014 where many of its toxic assets are parked \u2013 while leaving the healthier part of the bank in private hands.",

There have been suggestions that it will need help from the eurozone's rescue fund to tackle the problem.</p> <p>Prime minister Mariano Rajoy dodged questions on Bankia saying only that reforms to be announced by Friday will \"will help solve a lot of Spain's economic problems\".</p> <p>Those reforms will include yet another round of provisioning against toxic real estate with banks ordered to set aside a further \u20ac35bn on top of the \u20ac54bn they are already provisioning, financial sources told Reuters.</p> <p>Bankia was created just 17 months ago by the merger of seven regional savings banks in an attempt to shore up their combined defences against the bad real estate loans, worthless building land and unsold apartment blocks they had accumulated.</p> <p>Saving banks, many controlled by local politicians, were the most reckless lenders to developers, land speculators and building companies, which have left Spanish banks burdened with \u20ac184bn of problem loans and assets.</p> <p>Alberto Garz\u00f3n, a deputy for the communist-led United Left party, warned Rajoy against using public money to nationalise only the Bankia group's separate \"bad bank\" \u2014 where many of its toxic assets are parked \u2013 while leaving the healthier part of the bank in private hands.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jeffrey Rosen, chairman of the remuneration committee at WPP, is to embark on a series of meetings with investors in an attempt to head off a row over a 30% pay rise for chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. Even before the current wave of shareholder activism - dubbed the \"shareholder spring\" - WPP was forced to rethink the scale of the pay rise for Sorrell, who founded the firm more than 25 years ago. In the autumn, WPP presented a plan to shareholders to hand Sorrell - already on a basic salary of \u00a31m a year - a 50% pay rise but this was scaled back to 30% when the annual report was published last month. Rosen, a New York-based investment banker, is expected to argue that Sorrell - who took home \u00a313m in 2011 - has not had a salary rise since 2007 and needs to be paid fairly. He is also likely to argue that WPP has outperformed its peers over one, five and 10 years. Shareholders in WPP do not need to decide how to vote on the remuneration report for a number of weeks as the annual meeting is on 13 June. They are expected to give Rosen a chance to deliver his views before taking a final position. Rosen, though, is likely to be hoping to avoid a scenario similar to last year when more than 40% of shareholders rejected the remuneration report. A spokesman for WPP confirmed meetings were taking place. \"WPP always holds meetings with shareholders following the publication of the annual report and has always encouraged shareholder communication,\" a WPP spokesman said. The meetings come as investors are lodging protests at a wide-range of companies from Barclays, to Premier Food and insurance company Aviva where the remuneration report was voted down, sparking the departure of chief executive Andrew Moss yesterday. Moss was the third chief executive to bow out in recent weeks under shareholder pressure, as Astra Zeneca's David Brennan and Trinty Mirror's Sly Bailey also announced plans to leave. Trinity Mirror's annual meeting is today and is the latest in a string of annual meetings that traditionally take place between April and June. At the Unilever annual meeting on Wednesday, there was a vote of more than 10% against the re-election of Paul Walsh, a non-executive director who is also chief executive of Diageo. Just 9.3% failed to back the pay plans of the Marmite-to-Dove company. Private shareholder Brian Hutchings, who was at the Unilever AGM and voted against the 6% pay rise for chief executive Paul Polman, said he believed major shareholders had been appeased beforehand. Hutchings said: \"They've seen what's happened elsewhere and taken care to watch their backs with institutional shareholders.\" After the tumultuous annual meeting at Barclays earlier this month, investors in Standard Chartered appeared to be more concerned with the bank's sponsorship of Liverpool football club than remuneration at its annual meeting where 10% of investors failed to back the pay plans. But there was a protest against non-executive Rudy Markham, a former Unilever finance director, who endured a 20% vote against his re-election to the Standard Chartered board as he has served more than nine years and is no longer regarded as independent under shareholder guidelines. Manufacturing company Melrose also held its annual meeting on Wednesday and suffered a protest vote against its auditors, Deloitte, when almost 30% of investors failed to back their reappointment.",

Human Genome has hired Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse to negotiate a sale to GSK or another company at the \"right\" price, which has not been specified.</p> <p>GSK's chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, said at the company's annual meeting last week: \"We think we can deliver an extraordinary return to HGS shareholders through this acquisition.\" He described the deal as a \"very compelling acquisition\", as well as a \"very small transaction\".</p> <p>He rejected the idea of a mega-merger with another big pharma company, involving thousands of employees. \"To merge together two giant corporations is inevitably distracting,\" he said.</p> <p>Human Genome's top 10 investors hold nearly 80% of the company, led by Loomis, T Rowe Price and Fidelity. It appears that some Human Genome shareholders may hold out for a better offer. Mark Evans, a fund manager at Taube Hodson Stonex, the sixth largest investor in Human Genome with a 5.6% stake, told Reuters: \"They [GSK] will do fantastically well out of this \u2013 at $13 it is a steal. I still think it is very likely that they will have to pay more.\"</p> <p>But analysts are sceptical. Graham Parry, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said: \"We do not see an alternative natural buyer, given GSK has rights to most of the key assets hence is in the best position to extract synergies in our view. We therefore do not see GSK raising its offer substantially to value-destructive levels.\"</p> <p>Mike Mitchell, at Seymour Pierce, said: \"Witty's positioning on rationale remains unchanged, as does the view on valuation. We noted last month that we believed some sort of deal was likely and, in light of the broader challenges across the industry, we continue to believe it will be difficult for shareholders to ignore the certainty of a cash offer.\"</p> <p>GSK and Human Genome jointly developed Benlysta, the first new treatment for lupus in half a century. Sales have disappointed so far, but analysts say it could generate annual revenues of up to $5bn. The two companies are also working together on two experimental treatments \u2013 a heart drug, darapladib, and a diabetes treatment, albiglutide, which are both are in late-stage development. Buying Human Genome would give GSK full rights to these medicines.</p>",

GSK's chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, said at the company's annual meeting last week: \"We think we can deliver an extraordinary return to HGS shareholders through this acquisition.\" He described the deal as a \"very compelling acquisition\", as well as a \"very small transaction\". He rejected the idea of a mega-merger with another big pharma company, involving thousands of employees. \"To merge together two giant corporations is inevitably distracting,\" he said. Human Genome's top 10 investors hold nearly 80% of the company, led by Loomis, T Rowe Price and Fidelity. It appears that some Human Genome shareholders may hold out for a better offer. Mark Evans, a fund manager at Taube Hodson Stonex, the sixth largest investor in Human Genome with a 5.6% stake, told Reuters: \"They [GSK] will do fantastically well out of this \u2013 at $13 it is a steal. I still think it is very likely that they will have to pay more.\" But analysts are sceptical. Graham Parry, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said: \"We do not see an alternative natural buyer, given GSK has rights to most of the key assets hence is in the best position to extract synergies in our view. We therefore do not see GSK raising its offer substantially to value-destructive levels.\" Mike Mitchell, at Seymour Pierce, said: \"Witty's positioning on rationale remains unchanged, as does the view on valuation. We noted last month that we believed some sort of deal was likely and, in light of the broader challenges across the industry, we continue to believe it will be difficult for shareholders to ignore the certainty of a cash offer.\" GSK and Human Genome jointly developed Benlysta, the first new treatment for lupus in half a century. Sales have disappointed so far, but analysts say it could generate annual revenues of up to $5bn. The two companies are also working together on two experimental treatments \u2013 a heart drug, darapladib, and a diabetes treatment, albiglutide, which are both are in late-stage development. Buying Human Genome would give GSK full rights to these medicines.",

      "bodyText": "More than 100 London investment bankers will share \u20ac50m (\u00a340m) in backdated bonuses after the high court ordered Commerzbank to honour a four-year-old \"binding\" contract. Despite sustaining heavy losses in the credit crunch, Commerzbank, which acquired the City of London investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd (DKL) when it took control of Dresdner Bank in 2009, will now have to pay DKL employees sums amounting in some cases to more than \u20ac2m each. The judgment, dating back to a 2008 dispute, comes as shareholder sentiment is turning against excessive wage deals for City executives and is likely to reinforce the popular perception that banks are run for the benefit of senior staff.
