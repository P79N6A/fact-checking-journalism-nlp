      "bodyText": "A senior Volkswagen executive was sentenced to seven years in prison by a US court on Wednesday after being found guilty of concealing software used to evade pollution limits on nearly 600,000 diesel vehicles. Oliver Schmidt, a German national who was the general manager in charge of VW\u2019s environmental and engineering office in Michigan, had pleaded guilty to his part in the cover-up and argued he was \u201cmisused\u201d by VW in its attempts to circumvent US emissions tests. But at the sentencing in Detroit judge Sean Cox sided with the prosecution. \u201cIt is my opinion that you are a key conspirator in this scheme to defraud the United States,\u201d Cox told Schmidt in court. \u201cYou saw this as your opportunity to shine \u2026 and climb the corporate ladder at VW.\u201d Schmidt read a written statement in court acknowledging his guilt and broke down when discussing his family\u2019s sacrifices on his behalf since his arrest in January. \u201cI made bad decisions and for that I am sorry,\u201d he said. Alongside the sentence Schmidt was fined $400,000. Both the jail term and the fine were at the top end of sentencing guidelines. Schmidt, who oversaw emissions at VW\u2019s office in Michigan from 2012 to early 2015, met with key California regulators in 2015 but did not disclose the rogue software. The government said he later misled US investigators and destroyed documents. Schmidt\u2019s lawyers argued that his role only heated up in 2015, years after others at VW hatched the scheme, which violated the Clean Air Act. \u201cThe defendant has a leadership role within VW,\u201d federal officials said. \u201cAs a consequence of that role, he was literally in the room for important decisions during the height of the criminal scheme.\u201d VW pleaded guilty as a corporation in March and agreed to pay billions of dollars in fines. Schmidt, who had returned to Germany, was arrested in Florida in January after attempting to return home from a vacation following the filing of an FBI complaint. He is the highest-ranking VW employee to be convicted in the scheme in the US and the chances that the US authorities will prosecute more senior VW executives are slim as most are in Germany, which is unlikely to extradite its citizens to stand trial in the US.",

      "bodyText": "The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, unveiled his \u201cnew vision for our railways\u201d a week ago and gained a few favourable headlines for the modest commitment to reopen a few lines closed in the Beeching cuts of the 1960s. Forget that crowd-pleasing diversion, however, because it\u2019s not what the rail industry is talking about. Instead, rail bosses are dumbfounded that Stagecoach is being bailed out of its onerous contract on the East Coast main line. And they struggle to understand how Grayling\u2019s new \u201cpublic-private partnerships\u201d are supposed to work. The model \u2013 to be adopted on some lines but not on others \u2013 just seems to add complexity to a franchising system that is already baffling. First, the Stagecoach affair: as Lord Adonis, former transport secretary under Labour, has been saying loudly, the soft-shoe shuffle looks outrageous. Stagecoach, in partnership with Virgin Group, won the East Coast franchise by promising to pay the Treasury \u00a33.3bn under a contract that was supposed to run until 2023. Now that contract \u2013 currently loss-making for Stagecoach \u2013 is being ripped up early, to be replaced in 2020 by the new-fangled public-private arrangement. The net effect is that Stagecoach is off the hook, more or less. It may still forfeit \u00a3165m, but there\u2019s no chance of it being asked to honour the original contract. Instead, new terms will be renegotiated to run until 2020 and, hey presto, the company can also bid to be part of the public-private show that will follow. It\u2019s a sweetheart deal, rivals complain privately. You can\u2019t blame them. They have had their fill of Stagecoach preaching about other firms bidding aggressively to win contracts. They were looking forward to seeing the tables turned. Why aren\u2019t they saying so out loud? Partly, one suspects, because they may wish do business with Grayling themselves one day. Adonis claimed on Wednesday that FirstGroup is consulting its lawyers to see if, post-Stagecoach, it can get help with its loss-making TransPennine Express franchise. The company says not, but Adonis\u2019s underlying point remains: Grayling may have set a costly (for taxpayers) precedent on the East Coast line. The wider picture is also alarming. Grayling\u2019s big idea of getting train operators to work more closely with Network Rail is widely seen as sensible, but the franchising system now seems more muddled than ever. Sometimes franchises are awarded via competitive tender; sometimes they are just handed out via a \u201cdirect award\u201d; and now public-private partnerships will enter the mix. Even before last week, some of the results seemed perverse. Govia, the firm controlled by Go-Ahead Group, made a mess of its Southern franchise but was well regarded on the London Midland line, not least because it forced genuine competition and lower fares on the Euston to Birmingham New Street route. Yet Govia has been booted off, to be replaced by a consortium that includes a Dutch state-owned firm that presumably enjoys lower costs of capital. How does that work? Govia performs well and loses London Midland to save the Treasury money, but Stagecoach over-bids on the East Coast and gets bailed out. Where is the rhyme or reason? Adonis should keep pressing. The government\u2019s \u201cnew vision\u201d looks suspiciously like a short-termist approach designed to silence Labour\u2019s nationalisation chant. Coherent, it ain\u2019t. Christmas sale for Intu Little has gone well for Intu since it changed its name in 2013 from Capital Shopping Centres, which was a better label for a company that owns the Trafford Centre near Manchester, Lakeside in Essex and Gateshead\u2019s Metrocentre. The share price in those days was pushing 330p. Now, at a moment when the stock had dipped under 200p, Intu is selling itself to Hammerson for \u00a33.4bn. Intu gets Hammerson paper worth 238p a share, which is an improvement of sorts, but the terms hardly count as a triumph when the assets, according to the last valuation, are worth 403p when adjusted for debt. Why sell? One assumes John Whittaker, the billionaire who controls 27% of Intu, would prefer to spread his financial risk, which would be logical. Intu\u2019s debt load is heavy and an impediment to buying more properties, say analysts. Hammerson should be able to refinance at better rates. Yet, in the age of internet shopping, the deal hardly screams confidence on either side. Hammerson is only jumping because it\u2019s getting a relative bargain. Intu looks as if it\u2019s running for shelter. The duo are also taking that risk that the customers \u2013 retail tenants \u2013 head straight to the Competition and Markets Authority. Given that Hammerson-Intu would own 17 of the 25 biggest shopping centres in the UK, that risk is real. Still, at least the irritating Intu name will be dropped, if not from the centres themselves. That would be an improvement.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair is facing the threat of pre-Christmas industrial action in three European markets, including its first ever pilots\u2019 strike. Pilots in Italy have voted to strike for four hours on 15 December, while colleagues in Dublin are voting on whether to follow suit, just days after Portuguese pilots voted in favour of industrial action. Ryanair brushed off the prospect of fresh disruption, saying that previous threatened strikes hade failed to materialise. The carrier\u2019s relationship with its pilots has become increasingly strained after rostering problemsled to 20,000 flight cancellations. Ryanair moved to head off the threat of Portuguese and Italian action spreading to Ireland on Thursday, warning pilots that their pay and conditions may be affected if they vote in favour of a strike. In a memo to captains and first officers in Dublin, the Irish airline said it would freeze promotions, cut cash allowances and move pilots to different bases if they supported industrial action during ballots being held this week. Speaking earlier this week, the Irish pilots union, IALPA, said its members were considering following their counterparts in Italy and Portugal by backing industrial action. Capt Evan Cullen, the union\u2019s president, said: \u201cThe pilot issues which gave rise to the flight cancellations earlier this year have not been adequately addressed. Ryanair pilots, who are members of IALPA, are currently considering their options.\u201d Ryanair said: \u201cWe regularly receive threats of industrial action from competitor airline pilot unions from Italy, Portugal and even Aer Lingus pilots occasionally. Both we and our pilots ignore these letters.\u201d The Italian pilots\u2019 union, Anpac, which claims to represent 280 of Ryanair\u2019s approximately 4,000 pilots, said on Wednesday its members would not work between 2pm and 6pm on 15 December. Ryanair, which does not recognise trade unions, said Anpac was an Alitalia union with \u201cno role\u201d in the company. Ryanair pointed out that Anpac had previously voted to strike six times without any action taking place. \u201cWe expect this latest threatened strike will also be postponed or cancelled,\u201d a spokesperson said. Relations between Ryanair and its pilots have soured since it announced two waves of cancellations due to an error in how it schedules their hours. Michael O\u2019Leary, Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, admitted the airline had been \u201ctoo tight on pilot numbers\u201d. The company has been recruiting to solve the problem. Pilots are understood to have been emboldened by a belief that the airline is still short of qualified pilots and are coordinating their efforts via their European employee representative committee (ERC) composed of current Ryanair pilots. Ryanair deals with multiple European ERCs separately, allowing it to negotiate separate terms with different bases of operations.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stagecoach has said it hopes to continue running the East Coast rail route after 2020, when it will exit its current contract three years early with a potential \u00a32bn shortfall for the taxpayer. Labour said the firm should be barred from bidding again, amid warnings that the effective bailout on its Virgin Trains East Coast franchise could cause a crisis across the rail industry. The government has waived the majority of payments due under the Scottish transport group\u2019s \u00a33.3bn contract to run the London to Edinburgh route, agreeing to replace it with a less onerous partnership model at the end of the decade. Stagecoach, which could pay only \u00a31bn to the Treasury under the current deal, indicated it would bid to run the line once more. Martin Griffiths, chief executive of Stagecoach, said: \u201cThe secretary of state has said [East Coast Partnership] would be a more joined-up railway between the public and private sector. From our point of view being the operator would be important.\u201d Announcing increased group profits on Wednesday, the transport company said it also expects to be given further direct awards, without competition, to continue operating two more franchises \u2013 East Midland and West Coast \u2013 after 2019. A rail strategy published by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, last week revealed that from 2020 an East Coast Partnership would replace the Stagecoach-Virgin franchise contract, which was due to expire in 2023. Stagecoach is also seeking to renegotiate terms and payments of its contract until 2020, after admitting having overbid to run a line that had been in public sector operation for six years before reprivatisation in 2015. Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cThe idea that Stagecoach may again bid for rail contracts following the company\u2019s failure on the East Coast line shows that the rail franchising system is truly broken beyond repair. \u201cLabour would ban Stagecoach from running passenger rail operations in the UK. Grayling should commit to doing the same and come clean about the taxpayer bailout to the company he signed off last week.\u201d Stagecoach said it would honour its financial commitments, which would see it forfeiting a \u00a3165m guarantee. Griffiths said the firm wwas likely to bid to continue running the East Coast under Grayling\u2019s proposed partnership model. \u201cWe are a big operator in UK rail,\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cWe are looking at Southeastern and the West Coast partnership. We\u2019ll assess them on their merits. \u201c[Grayling] has announced that he\u2019s got a different vision for railway post 2020, part of that includes the East Coast. In the intervening period, while the revenue growth has been lower and the franchises has been loss-making, there is significant investment in the stations and upgrading the fleet, the technology and the customer experience. These are all significant benefits to the passenger today and to the franchise in the long term.\u201d However, Lord Adonis, chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission and former transport secretary, said the bailout was sparking a crisis in rail. He claimed that FirstGroup \u2013 which was shortlisted for the East Coast line \u2013 could use the precedent to seek a way out of another struggling franchise. He said on Twitter that FirstGroup was \u201closing big money\u201d on TransPennine Express after overbidding, adding that he had been told FirstGroup\u2019s lawyers were \u201clooking very carefully\u201d at the bailout of Stagecoach-Virgin. A spokesman for FirstGroup denied Adonis\u2019s claims, adding that revenue growth was running slightly lower than the group\u2019s projections but most growth would come from new trains due in 2018. Stagecoach\u2019s pre-tax profits for the first half of 2017-18 were up 8% to \u00a396.7m. The group\u2019s share price rose another 5% on Wednesday morning, following a 15% leap last week on news of the bailout.",

      "bodyText": "Bubble or not, Bitcoin, meanwhile, is still sharply higher, albeit off its record levels. It is up 8.7% at $12,696, down from the peak of 12,815 recorded earlier. And on that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It has been a nervous day for investors in equities, with markets unsettled by a range of factors, including the latest Brexit confusion, concerns about the US tax reforms and the country\u2019s debt ceiling and next week\u2019s expected interest rise from the Federal Reserve. But European markets ended off their worst levels, with the final scores showing: The FTSE 100 finished up 20.53 points or 0.28% at 7348.03 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.38% to 12,998.85 France\u2019s Cac closed down just 0.02% at 5374.35 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.49% to 22,307.28 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.27% at 10,184.0 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.4% to 727.53 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 29 points or 0.12%. US crude oil stocks fell by more than expected last week but after an initial rise, prices fell back again as investors focused on rising production figures. Crude inventories dropped by 5.6m barrels, more than the forecast 3.4m decline. But gasoline stocks rose by a much larger than expected 6.8m barrels, rather than the 1.7m rise which had been forecast. And crude production continued to rise, up 25,000 barrels a day and hitting a new weekly record. John Kilduff at Again Capital told Reuters: Demand for gasoline is curiously weak. And these weeks towards the end of the shopping period normally rival the summertime. So the report overall was bearish. So Brent crude is currently down 1.2% at $62.08 a barrel. Earlier the Bank of Canada held the country\u2019s interest rate at 1%, as expected. But it suggested that further rate hikes, after rises in July and September, would be required \u201cover time\u201d and the bank would be cautious about assessing the outlook for the economy. Global markets have come off their worst levels but there is still a fairly downbeat mood for the most part. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The FTSE managed to shake off its early losses this Wednesday, a luxury not afforded to its European and US peers. Signs of a reversal in the mining sector, and the pound\u2019s continued problems, meant the UK index could push 0.3% higher this afternoon, once against lifting the FTSE above 7350. Sterling, meanwhile did see its situation improve, but not by much; the pound is still down 0.4% against the dollar and 0.3% against the euro, with investors processing the lunchtime shock of David Davis admitting that the government hasn\u2019t done a sector-by-sector Brexit impact assessment. While they couldn\u2019t completely erase their losses like the FTSE, some of the red mist coating the Eurozone indices has cleared as the day\u2019s gone on. The DAX\u2019s decline is now at 0.8%, compared to the 1.2% drop seen at the open, with the CAC slipping a comparatively meagre 0.2%. As for the Dow Jones, the index dipped just 0.1% points after the bell. That leaves the Dow just above 24150, around 400 points lower than Monday\u2019s all-time intraday high, and the index\u2019s worst price since last Friday\u2019s Michael Flynn-inspired panic. In terms of data, US investors got a taster of Friday\u2019s non-farm jobs report as the ADP reading fell from 235k in October to 190k in November. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage.

For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: Speaking of Brexit, chancellor Philip Hammond is up before the Treasury Select committee and leaving the EU is obviously one of the topics. All the developments are in our politics live blog: Back with the pound, and any breakthrough in the Brexit discussions are likely to boost the currency, says Richard Falkenh\u00e4ll, senior foreign exchange strategist at Nordic bank SEB: Despite new set-backs in Brexit talks, we think there will be a solution which will pave the way for EU leaders to initiate stage two in talks when they meet next week (14-15 December). Should this be the case, our estimated Brexit risk premium suggests it would be followed by a generally stronger GBP. We target at least 0.85 in EUR/GBP on a solution that would break current deadlock in Brexit talks. Time is running out but our base scenario remains that leaders will come up with a solution that satisfies EU-leaders on 14 December, moving negotiations to stage two. We continue to expect any signs of a breakthrough in negotiations between the parties to boost the GBP by decreasing the Brexit risk premium. In our view, the risk premium reflects the possibility that the UK will leave the EU without a deal in March 2019, a situation that would likely be extremely negative for the country\u2019s growth outlook. If a divorce deal is reached, clearing the way for trade negotiations to start later this month, then the risk premium should be considerably smaller than it is today, as the potential negative impact on the UK economy of the country\u2019s withdrawal from the EU will have been much reduced. At the moment the euro/pound is at 0.88 while against the dollar, the pound is down 0.45% at $1.3382. ADP\u2019s commentators are upbeat about their latest jobs report, although there is a warning the market could overheat in 2018: \u201cThe labor market continues to grow at a solid pace,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. \u201cNotably, manufacturing added the most jobs the industry has seen all year. As the labor market continues to tighten and wages increase it will become increasingly difficult for employers to attract and retain skilled talent.\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said, \u201cThe job market is red hot, with broad-based job gains across industries and company sizes. The only soft spots are in industries being disrupted by technology, brick-and-mortar retailing being the best example. There is a mounting threat that the job market will overheat next year.\u201d Newsflash: America\u2019s private sector created 190,000 jobs last month, according to payroll operator ADP. That\u2019s a pretty decent performance, and bang in line with forecasts. It suggests the US employment market remains healthy - which bodes well for the wider Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) figures on Friday. But it\u2019s important that the NFP figures also show wage growth, otherwise Americans risk missing out on the benefits of the recovery. One rational explanation for bitcoin\u2019s recent explosive surge is that investors will soon be able to trade bitcoin futures. The advent of bitcoin derivatives will open up cryptocurrencies to a wider range of investors (City trading desks aren\u2019t necessarily au fait with bitcoin wallets). That could trigger a new surge of money in, right? Well, possibly. But derivative contracts can also be used to profit when an asset loses value. So they will allow traders to net that bitcoin is overvalued and heading for a crash. This chart shows how Bitcoin has surged ahead of its recent \u2018moving averages\u2019 - a traditional measure of an asset\u2019s value. If a correction comes, it could possibly drop back to these levels..... Neil Wilson of ETX Capital agrees that futures contracts will make bitcoin \u201cprice discovery...a lot less opaque\u201d. People will see just how badly priced it is. At the moment it\u2019s dominated by enthusiasts and speculators who want the price to go up. Once you get enough shorts and enough people taking the other side of the bet, there will have to be a significant repricing that pops the bubble. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is now defying the global selloff, and has crept up by 10 points (or 0.15%) today. But don\u2019t get the bunting out. The recovery is due to the pound\u2019s weakness, as the lack of Brexit progress alarms traders. The ongoing row over the Irish border, and fresh signs of cabinet divisions over the EU, is causing anxiety in the markets. Craig Erlam of foreign exchange firm OANDA explains: Sterling had previously rallied to two month highs against the greenback on the prospect of a deal being achieved, as both parties appeared to have closed in on a financial settlement being agreed, at least in theory. As it turns out, what had been touted as being the largest stumbling block has turned out to be nothing in comparison to finding a solution to the border problem that satisfies all involved. The next week could get very tense for Theresa May and questions over her leadership are already once again being asked, providing more downside pressure on the currency. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, has tweeted a chart showing how the pound has weakened since yesterday morning: South African retail group Steinhoff International have taken an almighty dive this morning, after it shocked the markets by announcing it had discovered accounting irregularities. Steinhoff, which recently bought British budget shops chain Poundland, has called experts from PwC in to examine its books. It also announced that its chief executive Markus Jooste had resigned. Shares in Steinhoff plunged by two thirds in Frankfurt - from almost \u20ac3 each to below \u20ac1 (qualifying them to be sold in Poundland!). Even more alarmingly, Steinhoff\u2019s bonds have tumbled in value, as investors worried that the company could struggle to repay its debts. (IG means investment grade, which ought to be relatively safe....) Bitcoin just struck a new record high, at $12,800. But this morning\u2019s ascent may have left it feeling dizzy -- the cryptocurrency promptly tumbled by $500 in a minute. Ben Kumar, investment manager at 7IM, says his firm are keeping clear from bitcoin, despite its surging popularity. Look at who Bitcoin was created by \u2013 some reclusive coding genius with a specific world view. For many people that is enough to dismiss it as a nerdy niche to be ignored. Yet reclusive coding geniuses have in recent years built some of the most successful companies in the world. But with Futures on Bitcoin to be launched later this month, the question is will that be the death knell, or another leg upwards, once hedge funds/ pension funds get involved? The jury is out, but hedge funds/ pension fund involvement won\u2019t necessarily chime with those who were attracted to Bitcoin in the first place.\u201d Most stock markets around the world are down today, most currencies have dropped against the US dollar, and most commodity prices are lower too. Over in the City, shares in insurance and holiday group Saga have plunged by 25% after a shock profits warning this morning. Saga, which targets the over-50s, warned it has suffered from the collapse of Monarch Airlines this autumn. This will wipe \u00a32m off its profits this year. Saga also told shareholders to brace for lower profits in 2018, as it throws an extra \u00a310m into its customer recruitment efforts. CEO Lance Batchelor said Saga had faced \u201csome challenging trading conditions\u201d in the last quarter. Shareholders have responded by wiping out almost a quarter of the company\u2019s value: The pound has lost ground against other major currencies today. The selloff picked up after David Davis, secretary of state for leaving the EU, told MPs that the government hasn\u2019t actually done any sector-by-sector analysis of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. Wall Street is expected to fall again when trading begins in four hours. The Dow Jones industrial average is down by 65 points in the futures market, or around 0.3%, and the S&amp;P 500 is also being called lower. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investors Services says: Markets show ever more signs of winding down for the holiday period, but continue to be buffeted into spasms of activity by the various political melodramas, which continue to pockmark this year. There are plenty of theories floating around for why the markets are down. One is that traders are banking profits after a successful year, and hunkering down until 2018. As Andrew Clarke, director of trading at Mirabaud, put it: [Investors are] locking in profits earlier than usual for the year and not opening any new positions,\u201d said \u201cEventually, as profit taking subsides, buying for the new year will appear as people look toward 2018.\u201d Another (as cited already) is that investors fear that the rally will become derailed by political developments (Events, dear boy, events!) Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, points out that the trigger could come from either side of the Atlantic: Global equity bulls were nowhere to be found during Tuesday\u2019s trading session as market players evaluated the possible impact of proposed US tax cuts. World stocks were mostly lower amid a global technology selloff, with the lack of appetite for riskier assets punishing European shares and Wall Street. Asian markets stumbled lower during early trading on Wednesday, following Wall Street\u2019s overnight decline. With the renewed Brexit uncertainty likely to tarnish risk sentiment further, European stocks remain vulnerable to further downside. American shares are still at risk of extending losses this afternoon, if concerns heighten over a potential US government shutdown on Friday if a spending bill is not approved. A third option: investors are starting to heed concerns that loose monetary policy and easy money have driven share prices to unsustainable levels. Top UK fund manager Neil Woodford railed against \u201cinflated\u201d asset prices earlier this week. He told clients that: Ten years on from the global financial crisis, we are witnessing the product of the biggest monetary policy experiment in history. Investors have forgotten about risk and this is playing out in inflated asset prices and inflated valuations. Whether it\u2019s Bitcoin going through $10,000, European junk bonds yielding less than US Treasuries, historic low levels of volatility or smart beta ETFs attracting gigantic inflows \u2013 there are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count..... The difference between the performance of value stocks and growth stocks today, is greater than at any stage in stock market history. This chart shows what Woodford is worried about: Brexit angst is weighing on the pound again this morning, following reports of a new cabinet split. According to the Daily Telegraph, Theresa May is facing a Cabinet revolt led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, who fear the Prime Minister is trying to force through a soft Brexit. This has knocked the pound back down below $1.34 this morning, down almost half a cent. As feared, European stock markets have fallen in early trading, following the losses in Asia. London\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 24 points, or 0.3%, partly dragged down by mining stocks following the fall in Chinese metal prices today. There are bigger declines across Europe; Germany\u2019s DAX has lost more than 1%. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada says the markets are fretting about the US debt ceiling deadline and Brexit. Optimism on US tax reform has given way to concern on Friday\u2019s deadline to avoid a government shutdown. There have been no public developments on the UK\u2019s position on the Irish border and reports suggest that EU officials are maintaining the line that the \u201cdeadline of deadlines\u201d for the UK\u2019s proposals is this Friday. The AFP newswire has a good take on today\u2019s selloff. Here\u2019s a flavour: Technology and energy firms were the biggest losers as Asian markets tumbled on Wednesday, extending a retreat across Europe and New York. A global equity rally has hit the buffers this week as the US probe into Russia\u2019s alleged election meddling sows uncertainty, Britain struggles to reach a Brexit deal with the European Union and traders remain cautious about Washington\u2019s ability to push through tax cuts. A key drag for Asia on Wednesday was copper prices which sank more than four percent in London, having already lost about 10 percent over the previous week. Analysts blamed a pick-up in the dollar on hopes for US tax cuts. There are also worries about China\u2019s crackdown on borrowing-fuelled investing. \u201cThe sentiment in China has turned less positive after the conclusion of the national party congress, as the deleveraging rhetoric has returned to the market, especially with regards to real estate speculation,\u201d TD Securities commodity strategist Ryan McKay told Bloomberg News. Former Republican congressman Ron Paul (a libertarian and long-time critic of central bankers) uncovered plenty of support for bitcoin among his followers: Let\u2019s remember to revisit this in 2027 to see who was right (Personally I\u2019d take the 10-year Treasuries) Is Bitcoin going to keep climbing, or is a crash around the corner? Naeem Aslam of Think Markets thinks we\u2019ll see more record highs, as investors will soon be able to trade bitcoin derivatives (allowing them to profit without actually owning the asset itself). It appears that the momentum is unstoppable and we do think that the 14K level could reach before the bitcoin futures start trading at the CBOE which is on the 11 December. Principally, investors are thoughtful that when institutional money (hedge funds) will be involved, the chances are that the price would move higher. Large investment funds have not been able to take the piece of the pie yet and that would be their opportunity to get on board. Bitcoin futures trading on the major stock exchanges would provide more assurance for retail investors that the derivative is trading in a regulatory frame work. This would provide tail wind for bitcoin. But.... are people actually buying bitcoin to use it, or just because they think someone else will pay more for it in future? This tweet from experienced economist Stephen Koukoulas suggests the latter.... Although the markets are down, Bitcoin is maintaining its charge upwards. The cryptocurrency has gained almost 6% this morning, bursting through the $12,000 mark to hit $12,488. Quite remarkable, given it started this year at $1,000. This latest surge comes in the face of warnings that bitcoin is a speculative bubble, and signs that regulators are concerned that organised crime gangs are using it to launder money. But bitcoin\u2019s supporters will argue that more people are waking up to the potential of digital currencies and the blockchain. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s an edgy mood in the financial markets today, as investors worry about geopolitical issues and the state of the global economy, and wonder if a correction could be looming. Japan\u2019s Nikkei share average has suffered its biggest fall in over eight months, tumbling by almost 2%. Other Asian markets also dropped, following a selloff on Wall Street yesterday, and Europe is expected to follow today. A range of factors are being blamed - including the stalled Brexit talks, and concerns over whether America\u2019s tax reforms will actually deliver growth (or even be finalised at all). Another factor: the news that US President Donald Trump will recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and set in motion the relocation of the U.S. Embassy, despite warnings that this will fuel tensions in the Middle East. Traders are also citing concerns over US politics, where a three-month suspension of America\u2019s debt ceiling is about to expire. That could force the US Treasury to start using \u2018extraordinary measures\u2019 to avoid breaching the cap, which might buy a few months grace... Debt-Limit Tracker: What to Watch in Markets as Suspension Ends 2017 has been a sterling year for the markets, but some commentators suggest that the rally may be fizzling out. Michael Hewson of CMS Markets says: Having seen some decent gains so far this year there appears to be increasing evidence that markets are starting to look a little tired. The first clues appeared yesterday when US markets after racing out of the blocks on Monday found it difficult to hold onto a lot of their gains, even if the Dow did manage to finish the day higher. The S&amp;P500 on the other hand declined for the third day in succession, its worst run of losses since August. This declining momentum has been something that has been particularly notable in European markets since the peaks back in early November, and while we have managed to find some level of support for most of the past week or so, the subsequent rebounds have been getting shallower. Overnight, the latest Australian growth figures have missed expectations. Australia\u2019s GDP rose by 0.6%, weaker than the 0.8% which analysts had expected. Over in China, a senior regulator warned of tougher oversight over financial markets and illegal financial dealings, helping to push shares down in Shanghai. Commodities are also having a bad day, with Shanghai copper prices falling by 3% on concerns that Chinese growth could slow next year. Investors will be looking to the latest US jobs report, to see how America\u2019s economy fared last month. Plus, the Bank of Canada will be in the spotlight as it announces its latest monetary policy decision.

Should this be the case, our estimated Brexit risk premium suggests it would be followed by a generally stronger GBP. We target at least 0.85 in EUR/GBP on a solution that would break current deadlock in Brexit talks.</p> <p>Time is running out but our base scenario remains that leaders will come up with a solution that satisfies EU-leaders on 14 December, moving negotiations to stage two. We continue to expect any signs of a breakthrough in negotiations between the parties to boost the GBP by decreasing the Brexit risk premium. In our view, the risk premium reflects the possibility that the UK will leave the EU without a deal in March 2019, a situation that would likely be extremely negative for the country\u2019s growth outlook.</p> <p>If a divorce deal is reached, clearing the way for trade negotiations to start later this month, then the risk premium should be considerably smaller than it is today, as the potential negative impact on the UK economy of the country\u2019s withdrawal from the EU will have been much reduced. </p> </blockquote> <p>At the moment the euro/pound is at 0.88 while against the dollar, the pound is down 0.45% at $1.3382.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-12-06T14:26:47.316Z\">at 2.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a27f70f4cd919066cd81e1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-06T13:59:45.468Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>ADP\u2019s commentators are upbeat about their latest jobs report, although there is a warning the market could overheat in 2018:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe labor market continues to grow at a solid pace,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. \u201cNotably, manufacturing added the most jobs the industry has seen all year.

      "bodyText": "The September quarter GDP figures released on Wednesday marked the end of the long period of transition out of the mining boom. With solid growth driven by new business investment, no longer is the economy unable to escape the drag of declining mining investment. However, while business seems to have turned a corner, households remain stuck in the dismal low-growth world that has typified the past five years. The latest GDP figures show that in September the economy grew by a neither brilliant nor bad 0.6%: This was a touch below expectations, and as a result the value of the dollar fell slightly, but nonetheless the figures were generally good. But they do highlight that what is classed as good is somewhat less so than was in the past. The economy grew 2.8% over the past year in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 a significant improvement on the 1.9% observed in the June quarter \u2013 and a touch lower at 2.4% in the less bouncy trend estimate. It means that while the economy has picked up, it has now been five years since the economy was growing above 3% in trend terms. What was once average growth is now a peak we haven\u2019t seen since September 2012. The average annual GDP growth over the past five years is just 2.5% \u2013 a level that in the past usually meant we had just been through a recession. Instead it now means that over the past five years, while we have not at any time gone backwards, neither has the economy had any surges: A major reason for that was the end of the mining boom \u2013 a period that saw the collapse of mining investment overwhelm the growth anywhere else in the economy. And yet in September, for the first time since 2013, private sector non-dwelling construction actually contributed to annual GDP growth rather than detracted from growth. The signs of this came late last week, when for the first time since December 2012, private new capital expenditure was higher in trend terms than it had been a year before: And the economic growth in September was largely off the back of this construction, which has been powered by strong public spending on infrastructure projects that is being undertaken by private sector firms: In September non-dwelling construction contributed 0.9% points towards overall growth \u2013 more than making up for the decline in net exports and dwelling construction \u2013 as the housing boom truly comes off the boil. But while business investment is back, households continue to be hesitant to spend. As household consumption led the way for annual growth, the contribution of 1.3% points is actually on the low side and reflects that in the past year household consumption grew just 2.2% \u2013 not just below the pre-GFC average of 4% growth but even below the average since then of 2.7%: It was for this reason that, in his press conference on Wednesday, Scott Morrison was at pains to note the issues for households. He noted of the soft consumption result that it was not surprising \u201cgiven the of living pressures on essentials that Australians are feeling\u201d. He also noted that \u201cclearly, many Australians were concerned about the cost of living and everyday pressures on their household budget.\u201d And that pressure remains despite the best growth in the compensation of employees for some time. In the September quarter, compensation of employees rose 1.2% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the best result since 2013. But while the annual growth of 3.3% is an improvement on the woeful and record low 1.9% growth observed in March, the average growth per employee is just 0.9%: As 0.9% remains well below inflation it means that real compensation per employee has gone backwards in the past 12 months and remains at a point below 2010 levels: This translates into a similarly poor result for household disposable income \u2013 a favoured measure for household living standards. In the past year, real household disposable income fell 1.9%, and it also means that the level of income households have at their disposal is lower than it was five years ago: All up the GDP figures show that the economy is improving, but at the moment business is leading and households are yet to see much benefit. That is perhaps to be expected \u2013 it does generally take a few years of solid investment and profits before wages begin to tick up. But overall the economy remains somewhat below par. Using my measure of adjusted nominal GDP growth, which combines real GDP and inflation growth, we see the economy is growing below what would be expected with both average GDP and inflation growth: But we should not be too negative. The signs are certainly good \u2013 and definitely much improved over this time last year. But nothing in these figures should have the Reserve Bank feeling a desperate need to raise interest rates. Yes, businesses, driven by government spending, are investing, but until households catch up, the construction of the new economy in a post-mining boom world remains a work in progress.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A state-owned South Korean energy firm is to take over construction of a troubled nuclear power station planned in north-west England, in a significant boost for the UK government\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Kepco has been declared the preferred bidder for the NuGeneration consortium, which looked doomed earlier this year after the Japanese owner Toshiba was hit by writedowns and the eventual bankruptcy of its US nuclear subsidiary. The plan to build reactors at Moorside in Cumbria suffered a further blow when France\u2019s Engie also pulled out and forced Toshiba to buy its $138.5m (\u00a3103.5m) stake. Kepco has emerged as the winner in a two-horse race between state-owned nuclear firms eyeing expansion overseas. The Korean group beat off competition from China General Nuclear (CGN), which has a \u00a36bn stake in the reactors that France\u2019s EDF is building at Hinkley Point and is working to build its own nuclear plant in Essex. Kepco and CGN are both looking to the UK after nuclear plant construction orders dried up globally in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Greg Clark, the business secretary, met Korean government ministers recently to discuss the NuGen deal, with insiders describing the talks as productive. The government is understood to have given the Koreans assurances that the UK is committed to a fleet of new nuclear plants, a plan that has been criticised in the face of the falling cost of renewables. Sources said it was Kepco\u2019s track record of building its reactors in the United Arab Emirates on time and on budget that helped it clinch the deal. Ministers, unions and the industry will cheer the outcome, which secures jobs and low-carbon power supplies that were at risk. But the new ownership and technology mean the plant will come online several years later than 2025, when electricity generation was originally due. Toshiba had cleared the painstaking, four- to five-year regulatory process of getting its reactor approved by UK authorities, a process Kepco will have to start from scratch. Kepco is understood to be planning to fit two of its APR-1400 reactors on the site, which would have a combined capacity of up to 3GW, similar to the 3.2GW for Hinkley Point C. As well as having to clear regulatory hurdles, the Koreans are also likely to have to negotiate with the government for a guaranteed price for power from the Moorside plant. That process took EDF several years for Hinkley and resulted in a contract that ensures the French will get \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour, or around twice the wholesale price, for 35 years. The UK\u2019s spending watchdog has called the project \u201crisky and expensive\u201d. The price of state support for offshore windfarms has since dropped to a record low of \u00a362.14 per MWh on average, leading one top German energy firm to say nuclear can no longer compete on price. A source close to the NuGen project said they accepted that whatever price the Koreans secured with the government, it would have to be \u201csignificantly below\u201d what was agreed for Hinkley. While the sale of NuGen from Toshiba to Kepco is not signed off yet, insiders described the selection of the South Korean company as a preferred bidder as a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d in the process. Minister are expected to use a nuclear conference on Thursday to announce a sector deal for the industry, as part of the government\u2019s industrial strategy. The government is likely to say it will look into ways of reducing the costs of financing new-build nuclear projects and confirm funding for a new generation of mini nuclear power plants, known as small modular reactors. In return, the industry will promise to cut the costs of cleaning up old nuclear plants by a fifth and slash the costs of building new nuclear power stations by 20%-30% over a decade.",

Andrew Boxer was told by managers at the London-based private hire and courier company that he could not work when they realised he had won an employment tribunal case against Excel, according to his union. They reportedly told Boxer they could not risk him taking a similar case against Addison Lee, which has a turnover of \u00a3260m, and asked: \u201cIs there an ulterior motive [for why] you want to work here? Do you want to report back to the union?\u201d The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said it would launch legal action against the company, alleging blacklisting and trade union victimisation. The case comes amid a welter of legal challenges over employment rights for workers in the gig economy, of which there are about 1.1 million. It emerged this week that the government has delayed proposals to clarify the difference between genuine self-employment and worker status that attracts greater employment rights. Gig economy workers miss out on \u00a322,000 each in employer pension contributions over a lifetime, according to a study released by Zurich Insurance on Wednesday. On 6 November, Boxer said he was told he could start work, but at his induction three days later, he was told he could not. \u201cI was there, I was happy to work and I ticked all the boxes, but because I once fought for my rights and won, I was denied a job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was shocking.\u201d The IWGB has backed successful employment tribunal claims for gig economy workers at Uber, Excel and CitySprint. Chris Gascoigne, a cycle courier who is also a member of the union, won a case against Addison Lee in which a tribunal ruled that it should treat him as a worker and not an independent contractor. According to the IWGB, the head of Addison Lee\u2019s courier business, Kevin Valentine, told Boxer: \u201cI\u2019m not blacklisting you, I just think it\u2019s insensitive that already we have Mr Gascoigne that is \u2026 taking us to the tribunal and to have someone else on our books that is also taking someone else to tribunal I think is a little bit insensitive.\u201d Boxer replied \u201cI am just here to work\u201d, to which Valentine said: \u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive issue at the moment. It is in the public domain \u2026 It does put us in a very vulnerable position.\u201d The union said it has a recording of the exchange and later in the conversation, Boxer said: \u201cBasically, you are just saying that because I have taken another company to court, you don\u2019t want me.\u201d Valentine replied: \u201cIt costs the company a fortune. If we gotta fight you, we gotta fight Gascoigne, we gotta fight everybody else, at the end of the day.\u201d Jason Moyer-Lee, the general secretary of the IWGB, said: \u201cAddison Lee has once again shown the extremes to which it is prepared to go in order to deny basic rights to its low-paid workers. \u201cThey are punishing a courier for having the courage to claim his unpaid holidays and minimum wage. For this, Addison Lee will pay a heavy price.\u201d A spokesman for Addison Lee said: \u201cAddison Lee is committed to fair and respectful treatment of all its contractors. Mr Boxer has never made a formal complaint to us. We are now reviewing the matter and it would be wrong to comment further until that review is complete.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The owner of Birmingham\u2019s Bullring shopping centre has agreed to buy the company behind Manchester\u2019s Trafford centre in a deal that will create Britain\u2019s biggest property company worth \u00a321bn. Hammerson, which also owns the Brent Cross shopping centre in London, is acquiring smaller rival Intu in a \u00a33.4bn deal that highlights the increasingly tough retail environment. The trend for online shopping is prompting many retailers to close stores and focus their property portfolio on the top tier of the most popular malls. Rents in the premium shopping centres are holding up or rising, while less popular malls and some high streets are struggling to survive. Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and Toys R Us have all announced plans to close stores this year while the collapse of BHS last year has also left shops empty. The cost of living squeeze caused by inflation outpacing wage growth has forced companies such as Hammerson and Intu into action, according to Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group. \u201cOnline shopping means shopping centres and high street shopping are in a long-term malaise,\u201d he said. \u201cShareholders will want to see assets sold down in the merged company to help fund the deal and to reflect the lower demand for bricks and mortar stores.\u201d The merged Intu and Hammerson group plans to sell at least \u00a32bn of assets to strengthen its balance sheet and allow it to reinvest in other, higher return opportunities. Analysts said the merged company was likely to focus efforts on its supermalls, where shoppers and retailers most want to be. The new group will own 12 of the country\u2019s 20 supermalls, including Birmingham\u2019s Bullring and Manchester\u2019s Arndale centre, according to retail analyst GlobalData. \u201cAs clothing and footwear retailers focus on supermalls to create large-scale, experience-led stores, physical retail spend will move away from town centres towards destination shopping centres, ensuring supermall space is hot property,\u201d said Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at GlobalData. \u201cThe proposed deal will net the group a stake in almost 60% of all UK supermall space, making it a force in the retail landscape, well placed to benefit from retail spend shifting across locations.\u201d Hammerson, which also owns Bicester Village, will pay 253.9p a share in a deal that values Intu at \u00a33.4bn. It will hand Hammerson Intu\u2019s porfolio of shopping centres in the UK and Spain, including Lakeside in Essex and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. Hammerson also owns property in Ireland and France. John Strachan, chairman of Intu, said the deal between the two companies would \u201cpresent a highly attractive proposition for retailers and shoppers in Europe\u2019s leading cities\u201d. He added: \u201cA combination of both Intu and Hammerson will create a more resilient, diversified and stronger group.\u201d The combined group will retain the Hammerson name and be led by the firm\u2019s chief executive, David Atkins. He said the deal would strengthen its portfolio and opportunities for growth, including in Spain and Ireland, two of Europe\u2019s fastest growing economies. \u201cThe acquisition creates a leading pan-European platform of desirable retail and leisure destinations which are better positioned to serve the needs of our retailers, excite our customers and support our partners and communities,\u201d Atkins said. Shares in Hammerson closed down more than 6% at 501.5p, while Intu shares were up nearly 14% at 226p. On Tuesday, the day before the deal was announced, Intu shares had fallen 27% since the beginning of the year. Hammerson said it expected the deal to generate \u00a325m of annual pre-tax savings by the end of the second year, as a result of lower office costs and by combining support functions such as IT and digital operations. The company expects a one-off cost of about \u00a340m as the two businesses are integrated. The deal would result in Hammerson shareholders owning about 55% of the enlarged company, with the remaining 45% owned by Intu shareholders. Hammerson, a FTSE 100 company, has received backing from investors who hold 50.6% of Intu shares \u2013 including from Peel, the property firm founded by John Whittaker, currently deputy chairman of Intu. Whittaker will retain the same role in the combined company. David Tyler, chairman of Hammerson, will become chairman of the new company.",

      "bodyText": "A bad look for a regulator is to appear afraid of the people it is regulating. That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS\u2019 now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. \u201cPublication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,\u201d say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can\u2019t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation \u2013 the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond \u2013 the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly \u201cfair and balanced\u201d by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or \u201cinappropriate treatment\u201d. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would \u201cincrease transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way\u201d. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person\u2019s report for the FCA, thought it \u201cwas written in a way that meant it could be published\u201d. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. \u2018So many flashing red lights\u2019 \u201cThere are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,\u201d the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit \u201cin relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties\u201d. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn \u2013 the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from \u00a332 in April to 790p, so it\u2019s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here\u2019s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (\u00a34.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack \u2013 the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth \u00a31.5bn, will raise \u00a31.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of \u00a33bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory. They\u2019re also taking up the rights to the new shares in full, which will cost them \u00a3475m, so they\u2019re also definitely committed. Good luck: not many other people are betting against the Netflix effect.",

      "bodyText": "Reforms to the gig economy expected to improve rights for up to 1.1 million people have been delayed until next year, in the latest sign that Brexit negotiations are hampering domestic policy. Ministers had intended to announce before the end of this month whether they would introduce fresh legislation on modern working practices. But that plan has been shelved amid growing concern that reforms to boost workers\u2019 rights could face parliamentary opposition from the rightwing of the Conservative party. Downing Street\u2019s adviser on modern work, Matthew Taylor, recommended reforms to employment law, which defines whether someone is a worker and therefore eligible for sick pay and the national minimum wage, or is genuinely self-employed. It was expected to mean enhanced terms for large numbers of gig workers including tens of thousands of minicab drivers and couriers working for companies such as Uber, Deliveroo and Hermes, which use technology to enable gig working and have treated people as self-employed and therefore not entitled to the national minimum wage or sick pay. It could also put an end to the rash of court cases being fought by gig economy contractors, many of whom have successfully claimed they are in fact treated as employed workers only without the benefits. The minicab app company Uber was told on Monday that it would not be allowed to immediately appeal to the supreme court following last year\u2019s test-case ruling that two of its drivers should have been classed as workers rather than self-employed. Instead it will have to make its case at the court of appeal, which means the legal dispute could extend into 2019. Hermes, the courier company, Deliveroo, the take-away delivery company, and Pimlico Plumbers are among the companies that have faced legal challenges over employment status. During this year\u2019s general election campaign, Theresa May promised the \u201cgreatest extension of rights and protections for employees by any Conservative government in history\u201d. She appointed Taylor in October 2016, four months after she became prime minister, and told the nation she would \u201cbe driven not by the interests of the privileged few\u201d but people such as those \u201cwho have a job but you don\u2019t always have job security\u201d. It is now five months since Taylor published his review in July and Margot James, a business minister, told parliament: \u201cI am determined that we consider the report very carefully and we will respond fully by the end of the year.\u201d However, parts of the reform have now been taken over by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, because they affect national insurance contributions, James revealed on Tuesday. She told parliament the government\u2019s view was \u201cthere is too much bogus self-employment\u201d. But the Treasury is thought to harbour concerns that any action that increases the cost of employment could reduce the total UK employment rate. Self-employment has accounted for 45% of all UK employment growth since 2008, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. \u201cMatthew Taylor\u2019s review threw up some complex ideas and was wide-ranging,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. \u201cIt is quite right the government gives due attention to the recommendations.\u201d One of the major gig economy companies told the Guardian that shifting self-employed contractors to worker status would increase the unit labour cost by 20%. Taylor confirmed on Tuesday that the response is now expected early next year. He said: \u201cI would rather it was later and stronger rather than earlier and weaker.\u201d There are around 1.1 million people in gig work in Britain, more than half of whom work as taxi drivers, delivery couriers, and in on-demand skilled building trades, cleaning, removals and DIY, according to the Royal Society of Arts.",

    "webTitle": "Private investment helps Australia's economy grow by 2.8%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s economy is growing at an annual rate of 2.8% after a solid pick-up in private investment in the September quarter. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.6% in the September quarter, in seasonally adjusted terms, helping the annual growth rate jump from 1.8% in the June quarter, and leaving the economy on track to reach the Reserve Bank\u2019s growth forecast for the year. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, says the result is \u201can encouraging set of numbers\u201d and shows the wisdom of the government\u2019s decision to focus on investment. He said Australia\u2019s economy was growing faster than the average growth rate of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries (at 2.6%), putting the economy \u201cback up towards the top of the pack of major advanced economies\u201d. But economists say the growth figures are disappointing because the strength in private investment has masked worryingly weak household consumption. \u201cToday\u2019s print is not a good number,\u201d a JP Morgan economist, Sally Auld, said. A Westpac economist, Andrew Hanlan, has also pointed out that the jump in the annual growth rate to 2.8% has a technical reason: the quarterly profile for GDP over the past year is now 0.9%, 0.4%, 0.9% and 0.6% (which equals 2.8%). It was helped by the -0.3% figure for the September quarter 2016 falling out of the calculation (a figure affected by the drop in economic activity before the July 2016 election). Bureau of Statistics figures show consumer spending grew by just 0.1% in the September quarter, compared with a forecast 0.4%, making it the weakest quarterly print since 2008. The spending figure was so weak because households pulled back significantly on spending at cafes and restaurants, on recreation, household goods, alcohol and tobacco and health services. Households also started saving more in the September quarter, a possible sign that people have become more reluctant to run down their savings to fund consumption. The household saving ratio increased from 3% to 3.2%. Households also pulled back on renovations. The -0.1% drop in dwelling investment in the September quarter \u2013 the third decline in a row \u2013 was due to a 4.8% fall in alterations and investment. Weak wages growth weighed on household budgets again, despite the declining unemployment rate. Average labour earnings increased by just 0.3% in the quarter and 0.6% over the year, and household disposable income rose by just 0.5% and 1.8% over the year, barely above the rate of inflation. \u201cThis print will come as a major disappointment for the RBA,\u201d Westpac\u2019s chief economist, Bill Evans, said. \u201cThe big concern is whether households, the engine of the economy, accept that expectations of a lift in wages growth are unjustified and it becomes necessary to adjust spending to a lower income outlook.\u201d The NAB\u2019s chief economist, Alan Oster, said the household sector dynamics were a concern. \u201cWhile total compensation of employees was solid at 1.2% quarter-on-quarter and 3% over the year, this is almost entirely due to strength in employment rather than wages,\u201d he said. Morrison said the important thing to focus on was private investment, because its contribution to growth more than tripled in the quarter. \u201cLooking specifically at investment, new private business investment is now growing at the strongest rate since the peak of the mining investment boom in 2012, expanding by 2% in the quarter and 7.5% through the year, to eclipse the 20-year average,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have now seen four consecutive quarters of investment growth, following 12 consecutive quarters of decline. \u201cBusiness conditions, as surveyed, are at their highest level in 20 years ... our enterprise tax plan is a key part of this, which is why it must be supported.\u201d Morrison was asked if the commonwealth budget could still afford to deliver personal income tax cuts and corporate tax cuts before the next election, as promised by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. He replied with one word: \u201cYes.\u201d",
