    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Weaker than forecast factory output in Germany and China sent the oil price below $100 on Tuesday and raised expectations that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates at its monthly meeting next month. German manufacturing contracted for the first time in five months while France, Italy and Spain suffered steep cutbacks in output. China maintained its recent upturn in output, though at a slower pace. Data from the US also showed a slowdown at its factories in April. The ECB is poised to reduce the base rate from 0.75% after months of bleak figures from across the single currency zone. Analysts said a rate cut was imminent after Jens Weidmann, head of Germany's central bank, conceded that lower interest rates would be considered should there be a worsening in the economic data. The prospect of cheaper funds from the ECB sent stock markets soaring. The FTSE 100 shrugged off the poor manufacturing figures to climb 125 points to 6406 while the Paris CAC finished the day up 3.6% at 3783. The gloomy state of the eurozone economies, which has surprised officials in Brussels, is likely to continue through the summer months, said analysts. The European Commission and the ECB had previously forecast a recovery in the second half of the year as a crisis that has forced Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus to apply for bailouts appeared to be receding. But northern Europe has increasingly suffered as austerity cuts in the south hit their exports. Christoph Weil, economist at Commerzbank, said it was likely the ECB will reduce interest rates to 0.5%, in line with the Bank of England. \"Investors are convinced the ECB will do whatever it takes to prevent a breakup of the monetary union. However, the central bank cannot solve the structural problems in the crisis countries with the printing press. \"For this reason the economic outlook for these countries remains rather gloomy. And the impact is felt not only by companies in the crisis countries. The lack of demand from the periphery is affecting also the core countries. As long as there is no marked improvement in sales prospects, even the low interest rates are unlikely to induce companies to invest more,\" he said. The US manufacturing sector also slowed, growing at its slowest pace in six months during April following a downturn in the domestic market. Markit's US manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 52 from 54.6, remaining just above the 50 level that marks the line between growth and contraction. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the findings suggested output growth was slowing sharply in the second quarter. \"While this week's first quarter GDP numbers may... bring some brighter news on the economy, the picture looks to have already begun to darken again, with GDP growth set to weaken in the second quarter.\" The US data \"will obviously add significantly to concerns, most recently related to the softer China and German data, that another seasonal slowdown in the global economy is taking hold,\" said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche Bank's head of G10 currency strategy.",

Markit's US manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 52 from 54.6, remaining just above the 50 level that marks the line between growth and contraction.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the findings suggested output growth was slowing sharply in the second quarter.</p> <p>\"While this week's first quarter GDP numbers may... bring some brighter news on the economy, the picture looks to have already begun to darken again, with GDP growth set to weaken in the second quarter.\"</p> <p>The US data \"will obviously add significantly to concerns, most recently related to the softer China and German data, that another seasonal slowdown in the global economy is taking hold,\" said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche Bank's head of G10 currency strategy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne is expected to expand his flagship \u00a380bn lending scheme on Wednesday in a bid to boost support for small businesses following criticism that most of the funds have been siphoned off by high street banks to cut homeowner's mortgage costs.</p> <p>The chancellor plans to extend the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) to specifically target banks that lend to small businesses, which are currently starved of credit.</p> <p>It is understood the Bank of England, which administers the scheme, has drawn up plans to expand the scope of the FLS to cover invoice finance houses and leasing firms. The scheme, which will be extended for a year until January 2015, will also offer lower interest rates to financial firms that can prove they are lending to small businesses following lobbying by the business secretary, Vince Cable.</p> <p>Business leaders welcomed the move, which they said was needed to compensate for the high cost and scarcity of loans to small and medium-sized businesses.</p> <p>Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, which represents manufacturing firms, said: \"Expanding lending to SMEs is the right call. Strengthening incentives for banks to lend to SMEs and other finance providers marks a step forward in addressing the problems faced by smaller firms in accessing credit on the right terms. Giving FLS a longer shelf life is also a helpful move.\"</p> <p>But he warned about the need for \"greater transparency in reporting the impact of FLS on lending to SMEs\" and \"a more concerted effort to promote FLS to businesses, many of which have disengaged from banks\".</p> <p>Pressure has mounted on the chancellor and Threadneedle Street to boost lending with unconventional measures following the reluctance of the central bank's monetary policy committee to boost the current \u00a3375bn quantitative easing (QE) programme</p> <p>The Bank held off another dose of QE earlier this month, and some economists believe it will wait until the arrival of new governor Mark Carney in July to resume asset purchases.</p> <p>The FLS announcement will come a day before the publication of official figures that are expected to show Britain narrowly avoided a triple-dip recession in the first quarter of the year.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne is expected to expand his flagship \u00a380bn lending scheme on Wednesday in a bid to boost support for small businesses following criticism that most of the funds have been siphoned off by high street banks to cut homeowner's mortgage costs. The chancellor plans to extend the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) to specifically target banks that lend to small businesses, which are currently starved of credit. It is understood the Bank of England, which administers the scheme, has drawn up plans to expand the scope of the FLS to cover invoice finance houses and leasing firms. The scheme, which will be extended for a year until January 2015, will also offer lower interest rates to financial firms that can prove they are lending to small businesses following lobbying by the business secretary, Vince Cable. Business leaders welcomed the move, which they said was needed to compensate for the high cost and scarcity of loans to small and medium-sized businesses. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, which represents manufacturing firms, said: \"Expanding lending to SMEs is the right call. Strengthening incentives for banks to lend to SMEs and other finance providers marks a step forward in addressing the problems faced by smaller firms in accessing credit on the right terms. Giving FLS a longer shelf life is also a helpful move.\" But he warned about the need for \"greater transparency in reporting the impact of FLS on lending to SMEs\" and \"a more concerted effort to promote FLS to businesses, many of which have disengaged from banks\". Pressure has mounted on the chancellor and Threadneedle Street to boost lending with unconventional measures following the reluctance of the central bank's monetary policy committee to boost the current \u00a3375bn quantitative easing (QE) programme The Bank held off another dose of QE earlier this month, and some economists believe it will wait until the arrival of new governor Mark Carney in July to resume asset purchases. The FLS announcement will come a day before the publication of official figures that are expected to show Britain narrowly avoided a triple-dip recession in the first quarter of the year. Analysts have predicted 0.1% growth in the three months to the end of April. Funding for Lending is one of the main vehicles the chancellor has chosen to expand lending, which until now has channelled funds through high street banks to the wider economy. The scheme provides discounted funds to the major banks, which they must pass on to customers when they approve loans. However, since the scheme got under way last summer, several banks \u2013 including Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Santander \u2013 have withdrawn more loans from business than they have approved. And critics have claimed that much of the new lending has gone to homeowners in the form of cheaper mortgages. Bank figures last week showed net lending to companies slumped by \u00a34.8bn in the three months to the end of February, declining by \u00a32.8bn in February alone. A Bank survey also showed that while credit availability has improved for big and medium-sized firms, small businesses still struggle to access funds. The same survey predicted \"significant increases\" in demand for credit from small and large firms in coming months. Policymakers at the Bank recently said they saw \"merit\" in boosting the FLS, and Osborne said at last month's budget that the Treasury and Bank were debating how to extend the scheme. The new scheme will allow small businesses to sidestep high street banks in favour of \"second tier\" invoice houses and leasing firms, many of which have struggled to offer loans since the banking crash, when access to international money markets dried up. The Bank's new move comes after the new archbishop of Canterbury warned on Monday night that Britain was mired in an economic depression and called for a breakup of a major bank in order to create regional lenders. The Bank of England declined to give details ahead of a formal announcement.",

      "bodyText": "Some \u00a31.3bn of market value was wiped on to Arm Holdings on Tuesday. That was the effect of a 12% jump in the microchip designer's share price. Call it about one-fifth of a Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 not bad, in a single day. The cause of the excitement was quarterly figures that were several steps beyond excellent. While the chip market trotted along at a gentle rate of 2% growth, Arm's revenues from royalties increased by 33%. The gains in market share were across the board. In mobile phones and tablets, the industry contracted by 1% but Arm was up 20%. In digital televisions, the chip industry expanded by 10% but Arm doubled its revenues. The result was a 44% rise in \"normalised\" first-quarter pre-tax profits to \u00a389.4m, about \u00a312m better than analysts had expected. Whether this powerful performance justifies a price-tag on the shares of 50 times this year's expected earnings is another matter: the valuation doesn't leave any room for error. On the other hand, there's a fair case that Arm's business model makes it more resilient than most technology companies. Whereas you can only buy an Intel chip from Intel, Arm licenses its designs to all and sundry. So, from the point of view of Apple and Samsung, the risk of being held to ransom by a single supplier is reduced. They may be obliged to buy Arm's superior energy-efficient chips for their smartphones but they can at least play one Arm-licensee off against another to achieve best prices. One day, you suspect, Intel, a company concentrated in the PC chip market, will get its act together to offer Arm stiffer competition in the smartphone game. But there's little sign of it yet, which is one reason why investors are willing to pay up to own Arm shares. That's their look-out. For departing chief executive Warren East, it was a spectacular last set of results. If he would now care to found a few more technology firms as successful as Arm, the rebalancing of the UK economy might begin.",

Call it about one-fifth of a Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 not bad, in a single day.</p> <p>The cause of the excitement was quarterly figures that were several steps beyond excellent. While the chip market trotted along at a gentle rate of 2% growth, Arm's revenues from royalties increased by 33%. The gains in market share were across the board. In mobile phones and tablets, the industry contracted by 1% but Arm was up 20%. In digital televisions, the chip industry expanded by 10% but Arm doubled its revenues. The result was a 44% rise in \"normalised\" first-quarter pre-tax profits to \u00a389.4m, about \u00a312m better than analysts had expected.</p> <p>Whether this powerful performance justifies a price-tag on the shares of 50 times this year's expected earnings is another matter: the valuation doesn't leave any room for error.</p> <p>On the other hand, there's a fair case that Arm's business model makes it more resilient than most technology companies. Whereas you can only buy an Intel chip from Intel, Arm licenses its designs to all and sundry. So, from the point of view of Apple and Samsung, the risk of being held to ransom by a single supplier is reduced. They may be obliged to buy Arm's superior energy-efficient chips for their smartphones but they can at least play one Arm-licensee off against another to achieve best prices.</p> <p>One day, you suspect, Intel, a company concentrated in the PC chip market, will get its act together to offer Arm stiffer competition in the smartphone game. But there's little sign of it yet, which is one reason why investors are willing to pay up to own Arm shares. That's their look-out. For departing chief executive Warren East, it was a spectacular last set of results. If he would now care to found a few more technology firms as successful as Arm, the rebalancing of the UK economy might begin.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Global stock markets moved sharply higher with the UK's leading index recording its best daily performance since 2 January.</p> <p>Much of the rise was due to hopes of an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank - perhaps as soon as next week - and an easing up of austerity after poor manufacturing data, particularly from Germany. There were also some disappointing purchasing manager indices from the US and China. But this was partly outweighed by a number of reasonable corporate results, including Netflix and Travelers in the US.</p> <p>In the UK, the star performer was <strong>Arm</strong>, up 103p to 972p or nearly 12%. The Cambridge-based chip designer beat profit forecasts after strong demand for smartphones and tablets using its technology.</p> <p>The business supplies the likes of Samsung and Qualcomm as well as <strong>Apple</strong>. But whereas Apple is expected <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/22/can-apple-stop-profits-rot\" title=\"\">to report disappointing figures later</a> as rivals eat into its market share, Arm is benefiting from its breadth of customers including Apple's competitors.</p> <p>So Arm reported a 44% jump in profits to \u00a389.4m, some \u00a310m ahead of analyst forecasts. As well as buoyant demand for its chip designs in smartphones and tablets and its low-energy processors, the company was also helped by the strength of the dollar after it collects most of its revenues in the US currency.</p> <p>Also reporting good figures was <strong>Associated British Foods</strong>, the grocery and sugars business which also owns discount clothing retailer Primark. Its shares ended 149p better at \u00a319.99.</p> <p>Primark, which opened 15 new stores in the first half including a second outlet on London's Oxford Street, was the driving force behind ABF recording a 10% rise in half year revenues to \u00a36.3bn and a 20% increase in operating profits to \u00a3496m.</p> <p>The retailer reported a 24% rise in first half sales - a 7% increase on a like-for-like basis after a good Christmas and despite the cold spell at the start of the year. Operating profits rose from \u00a3154m to \u00a3238m.

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets moved sharply higher with the UK's leading index recording its best daily performance since 2 January. Much of the rise was due to hopes of an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank - perhaps as soon as next week - and an easing up of austerity after poor manufacturing data, particularly from Germany. There were also some disappointing purchasing manager indices from the US and China. But this was partly outweighed by a number of reasonable corporate results, including Netflix and Travelers in the US. In the UK, the star performer was Arm, up 103p to 972p or nearly 12%. The Cambridge-based chip designer beat profit forecasts after strong demand for smartphones and tablets using its technology. The business supplies the likes of Samsung and Qualcomm as well as Apple. But whereas Apple is expected to report disappointing figures later as rivals eat into its market share, Arm is benefiting from its breadth of customers including Apple's competitors. So Arm reported a 44% jump in profits to \u00a389.4m, some \u00a310m ahead of analyst forecasts. As well as buoyant demand for its chip designs in smartphones and tablets and its low-energy processors, the company was also helped by the strength of the dollar after it collects most of its revenues in the US currency. Also reporting good figures was Associated British Foods, the grocery and sugars business which also owns discount clothing retailer Primark. Its shares ended 149p better at \u00a319.99. Primark, which opened 15 new stores in the first half including a second outlet on London's Oxford Street, was the driving force behind ABF recording a 10% rise in half year revenues to \u00a36.3bn and a 20% increase in operating profits to \u00a3496m. The retailer reported a 24% rise in first half sales - a 7% increase on a like-for-like basis after a good Christmas and despite the cold spell at the start of the year. Operating profits rose from \u00a3154m to \u00a3238m. Primark is also making a successful push into continental Europe and next year it will open its first stores in France. Arm and ABF were the top risers in the FTSE 100, which finished 125.50 points or 2% higher at 6406.12.

      "bodyText": "Unions are planning to ballot for strike at HBSC after the UK's biggest bank warned 3,166 staff that their roles were at risk. The bank further infuriated unions by describing the job cuts as \"demising\" roles, although HSBC insisted that because of new jobs being created the number of redundancies drops to 1,149. From 1 June, the financial advisers across the group will be combined and staff dealing with its 900,000 \"premier\" customers, those with deposits of more than \u00a350,000, will need to be better qualified. \"HSBC is making staff suffer in the search for ever greater profits. The bank's behaviour is a disgrace. After making proposals to slash pensions, holidays and sick pay the bank is now slashing even more jobs,\" said Unite national officer, Dominic Hook. \"Staff are at the end of their tether and we will be asking them in due course if they are prepared to take part in a strike ballot to oppose this unprecedented attack by this very profitable bank,\" said Hook. The bank said the \"integration of advisers means the roles of commercial financial advisers will be demised.\" It added it would be \"demising\" the jobs of 942 \"relationship managers\" who do not give financial advice and do not hold the necessary qualifications to be able to do so. The decision by the bank to describe the cuts as \"demising\" prompted the union to add: \"This is demeaning for staff who are real people and their lives are going to be drastically affected.\" The union also wants the bank to extend the consultation period \u2013 for redundancies although the bank insisted it had begun consultation with Unite at the beginning of March \u2013 to a full 90 days to implement the changes. The day after the bank's chairman, Douglas Flint, warned that new rules on the way financial advice is offered to customers could lead to poorer customers being squeezed out, HSBC revealed the impact on its 47,000 staff across the UK from changes requiring customers to pay upfront for financial advice. The bank refused to specify the precise number of other roles being axed but said 94 \"business specialist roles\" \u2013 staff who support small business customers \u2013 will be cut while 70 international business manager roles will be created. Jobs in \"other support functions\" are also going. Almost a year ago to the day, HSBC announced 3,167 job cuts, some 650 of which were again related to regulatory changes involving the way financial advice is provided to customers. In his first major decision since being promoted in September to run the retail bank in the UK, Antonio Simoes said: \"These proposals, together with the recent removal of all sales targets for our employees and the complete decoupling of incentives from those sales, mean our customers can expect us to fully focus on serving their needs and do the right thing. Evolving and improving our culture will take time but the changes announced today are another step in the right direction.\" The bank insisted it was \"doing everything possible to offer impacted employees opportunities\" from 2,017 new jobs that are being created. The bank said it was creating a \"diploma qualified adviser workforce of 853 people\" up from 571 who have the necessary qualifications already. But unions were worried that staff will either be based in the wrong part of the UK or not have the necessary qualifications for the new positions. \"The cuts HSBC is making will affect the whole business and will mean fewer personal advisers serving more customers and small and medium-sized businesses getting less support when they should be getting more. These cuts are about putting profits before people and will do nothing to improve service or the image of the banking industry,\" said Hook. The bank said it would offer 24-week training courses to allow staff to obtain the necessary qualifications. Brian Robertson, chief executive of HSBC's overall business in the UK, said: \"I understand change is always unsettling, particularly for those directly affected. However, I also firmly believe what we are proposing is essential in order for us to fulfil our customers' expectations.\"",

      "bodyText": "Surveys of private-sector activity in the eurozone have confirmed what many already knew: the core countries of France and Germany are being dragged down by Spain, Italy and the periphery of Portugal, Ireland and Greece. Germany was the last domino to fall, its drop in activity during March ending four months of expansion. France, a long-term sufferer from the austerity backwash, could already be said to have made its own contribution after a year of private-sector contraction. Figures for April show the level of contraction in France was a little less \u2013 but it was still dire. Most economists are busy revising their earlier forecasts for recovery in Europe from the summer onwards. No longer does the situation look so benign in 2014. And why should it? Austerity is not something that can be contained within periphery countries, even if that is seen as desirable. When Spaniards buy much of the gear you make plunging them into poverty, whatever the rights and wrongs of it, isn't going to help your economy. Given the level of car sales in the eurozone, the latest composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) figures for the currency area from Markit are merely a footnote. There is plenty of data showing car sales have crashed, and not just in Italy, Greece and Cyprus, where you might expect. In France they reached a 15-year low in March, when only 165,829 vehicles left garage forecourts. In Germany sales fell in the same month to 281,184. In Italy sales were 132,020 and Spain 72,677. The figures make the UK seem like a rosy haven of confidence with 394,806 new registrations. Is Brussels planning a change of policy? Maybe. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission chief, says austerity is at its limits. Other leaders have hinted that austerity could be relaxed and France is not alone in pursuing a longer-term deficit-reduction strategy. But Barroso's remarks should not be seen as indicating a change of heart. He said austerity was still \"fundamentally right\" and only questioned its efficacy after a decline in public support, which he said was needed for policies to work. \"While I think this policy is fundamentally right, I think it has reached its limits,\" he said.

He also disputed the beneficial effects of state spending as advocated by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, saying it was inefficient and squeezed out the private sector.</p> <p>McCafferty said gloomy analysis of the economy was overcooked and stressed the economy did not perform as badly as widely thought last year.</p> <p>\"If we adjust overall GDP growth for the sharp falls in construction and North Sea oil output, the rest of the economy \u2013 over 90% of GDP \u2013 grew by 1.2% last year. I do not wish to sound complacent; growth of even 1.2% across much of the economy is still at best a slow and difficult recovery. But it is also somewhat removed from the reports of semi-permanent, triple-dip recession.\"</p> <p>But he did say that the outlook for inflation, which has been above the Bank's government-set target for years, was \"more concerning\" and that it is expected to \"remain elevated for much of the next two years\".</p> <p>McCafferty, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/sep/11/ian-mccafferty-qe-fan?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">joined the MPC last September</a> from the business lobby group the CBI, also used his speech to defend the bank's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS). The scheme, which gives lenders access to cheap finance in order to help borrowers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/03/funding-for-lending-scheme-500m-pounds?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">has been criticised for its limited impact</a> so far on the financial health of the small and medium-sized businesses seen as key to powering economic recovery.</p> <p>McCafferty conceded \"we have yet to see a pickup in the levels of lending to the real economy\", but added he did not agree with some commentators that this was evidence that the FLS was not working. \"It is too early to judge the full effects of the FLS on bank lending volumes,\" he said.</p> <p>Turning to the international pressures on the UK economy, McCafferty said the outlook was improving with \"encouraging signs\" that the slowdown in China was ending and the recovery in the US was gaining momentum, benefitting UK exports.</p> <p>The speech coincided with a <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2013/04/maufacturing-orders-disappoint-but-output-increases/\" title=\"\">CBI survey</a> suggesting manufacturers' orders fell slightly in the three months to April but output increased and firms were expecting orders to grow in the next quarter.</p> <p>The CBI said the drop in total new orders was driven by a fall in domestic demand this quarter, the fastest pace of decline since January 2012, whereas export orders stabilised.</p>",

Speaking ahead of official GDP data due on Thursday that is expected to show the UK has just escaped a triple-dip recession, McCafferty's comments gave George Osborne a much needed boost after a difficult 10 days during which he was warned by the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, that he was \"playing with fire\" by sticking to his strategy of public sector cuts. A group of prominent economists also weighed in behind the chancellor to endorse the overall economic plan, which they said was heading in the right direction. Stephen King, the chief global economist at HSBC, the former Goldman Sachs economist Gavyn Davies and Roger Farmer, a professor of economics at the University of California, told MPs on the Treasury select committee that it would be unwise to embark on a large-scale spending spree to boost growth while government debt remained high. Farmer, a monetarist economist who has advised the Bank of England, said that while a government spending boost would generate growth, it would increase the size of the state, which is difficult to reduce in better economic times. He also disputed the beneficial effects of state spending as advocated by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, saying it was inefficient and squeezed out the private sector. McCafferty said gloomy analysis of the economy was overcooked and stressed the economy did not perform as badly as widely thought last year. \"If we adjust overall GDP growth for the sharp falls in construction and North Sea oil output, the rest of the economy \u2013 over 90% of GDP \u2013 grew by 1.2% last year. I do not wish to sound complacent; growth of even 1.2% across much of the economy is still at best a slow and difficult recovery. But it is also somewhat removed from the reports of semi-permanent, triple-dip recession.\" But he did say that the outlook for inflation, which has been above the Bank's government-set target for years, was \"more concerning\" and that it is expected to \"remain elevated for much of the next two years\". McCafferty, who joined the MPC last September from the business lobby group the CBI, also used his speech to defend the bank's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS). The scheme, which gives lenders access to cheap finance in order to help borrowers, has been criticised for its limited impact so far on the financial health of the small and medium-sized businesses seen as key to powering economic recovery. McCafferty conceded \"we have yet to see a pickup in the levels of lending to the real economy\", but added he did not agree with some commentators that this was evidence that the FLS was not working. \"It is too early to judge the full effects of the FLS on bank lending volumes,\" he said. Turning to the international pressures on the UK economy, McCafferty said the outlook was improving with \"encouraging signs\" that the slowdown in China was ending and the recovery in the US was gaining momentum, benefitting UK exports. The speech coincided with a CBI survey suggesting manufacturers' orders fell slightly in the three months to April but output increased and firms were expecting orders to grow in the next quarter. The CBI said the drop in total new orders was driven by a fall in domestic demand this quarter, the fastest pace of decline since January 2012, whereas export orders stabilised.",

      "bodyText": "Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy has opened the way to further tax rises and spending cuts, Reuters has reported. The country will publish updated economic forecasts and a new programme of reforms on Friday and Rajoy said in a press conference: We will not announce spending cuts like those we put out last year although we will likely need to review some entries in the budget. We don't want to increase value added tax or income tax this year, but we also depend on the growth rate and the deficit-cutting path for the next years. He also wants to introduce measures to promote growth. And on that it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back again tomorrow to follow all the latest developments. It's been a buoyant day for European stock markets, with traders pointing to a number of factors for the gains. For a start, the poor manufacturing data, particularly from Germany, encouraged the belief that the European Central Bank could cut interest rates, possibly as soon as next week. EC president Jose Manuel Barroso's comments that austerity may have reached the limits of public acceptance - albeit running into a dispute about what he actuallly meant - also encouraged investors. On top of that came some good corporate results from the likes of chipmaker Arm in the UK and Netflix in the US. So here's the scores on the doors: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 125.50 points or 2% higher at 6406.12, its biggest one day rise since 2 January \u2022 Germany's Dax jumped 2.41% \u2022 France's Cac climbed 3.58% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 2.93% \u2022 Spain's Ibex closed up 3.26% Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just over 1%. The prospect of an ECB cut sent the euro as low as $1.2971, with the currency currently down 0.44% at $1.3009. Spanish bond yields dipped to their lowest level since November 2012, encouraged by a positive treasury bill auction. Hopes of a resolution to the impasse since the Italian elections helped push the country's yields below 4% to 3.937% at the moment. Italy could potentially have a new government in place by the weekend if president Giorgio Napolitano's talks aimed at naming a prime minister succeed. But while there is some optimism a new government can be formed quickly, there may still be stumbling blocks. The favourite at the moment to step in and head a coalition government of the rival centre-left and centre-right parties is former prime minister Giuliano Amato. But the Northern League party said it would not be in any government headed by Amato or technocrat Mario Monti. And Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right People of Freedo party said it had no objections to another potential candidate for prime minister, Matteo Renzi, the centre-left mayor of Florence. However Reuters reported that Renzi had played down the possibility: It's the hypothesis which is most surprising and least probable, I don't think it's on the table. Spain's economy shrank by 0.5% in the first three months of the year, continuing the country's recession. The Bank of Spain blamed the fall on a drop in consumer spending, which was down 0.8% in the quarter. The Bank has forecast the economy will contract by 1.5% this year before returning to growth in late 2014. As reported earlier, Spain successfully sold \u20ac3bn worth of short-term debt at lower yields. Some reasonable housing data from the US but more downbeat manufacturing figures. First, sales of new single family homes rose 1.5% in March to 417,000 after a 7.6% drop in the previous month. This was a little short of forecasts of a rise to 420,000. But sales were up 18.5% year on year, a good indication of how the housing market has been recovering. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: In a nutshell, the US housing market remains on a moderate upward trend, also supported by falling mortgage rates and less restrictive credit conditions. But following a worse than expected US purchasing managers index earlier , the Richmond Federal Reserve index showed a contraction in April, down 6 compared to a rise of 3 in March. None of this has prevented stock markets - in the UK, Europe and the US - from roaring away. In Europe it seems to be the so-bad-it's-good syndrome, with poor figures (from Germany in particular) prompting talk of an interest rate cut from the ECB. Wall Street has been lifted by a number of reasonable corporate results, including Netflix and Travelers, as well as the housing data. Italy faces risks to its economic growth forecasts, an official from the country's cental bank has said. Reuters is reporting Daniele Franco as saying that there were downside risks to the forecasts of a 1.3% decline in GDP in 2013 and a 1.3% rise in 2014. He added that any new government - which we are still waiting for of course - must avoid any doubts over whether it would respect the 3% of GDP deficit limit. Meanwhile there is this comment from Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem: US manufacturing grew in April at its slowest pace for six months, with the lates PMI survey coming in below expectations. The Markit report showed the purchasing managers index fell to 52 from 54.6 in March, less than the forecast 54. It indicates that US manufacturing may be losing its momentum as consumers worry about tax hikes and government spending cuts. Meanwhile the newest member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee has been sounding an optimistic note on the UK economy. Growth will pick up pace this year, according to Ian McCafferty, who has sought to play down fears the country has slipped into an unprecedented triple-dip recession. My colleague Katie Allen writes: McCafferty said improving credit conditions, a brighter international outlook and his expectations of a recovery in business investment all made him \u201chopeful for the UK economy through 2013 and into 2014\u201d. \u201cOverall, I am hopeful for a modest pickup in growth as some of the negative factors that have made the last couple of years so difficult start to fade, and as levels of confidence, so badly battered by the impact of the euro crisis, start to heal,\u201d he said in a speech at the Coventry and Warwickshire Chamber of Commerce. Speaking ahead of official GDP data due on Thursday that is expected to show the UK has just escaped a triple-dip recession, McCafferty\u2019s comments gave George Osborne a much needed boost after a difficult 10 days during which he was warned by the IMF\u2019s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, that he was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by sticking to his strategy of public sector cuts. The Barroso comments continue to stir things up. German politician Norbert Barthle has apparently condemned the reported comments from EC president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso saying Europe's austerity programme had reached the limits of public acceptance: Growing talk of a rate cut by the European Central Bank, perhaps as early as next week, continues to lift eurozone debt. With Germany's private sector shrinking for the first time in five months, the country's bund futures are moving higher and the 10-year yield is down nearly 1 basis point at 1.215%. But peripheral debt is also performing well, with Italian yields down 12.5 basis points and Spanish yields 21 basis points lower. The hope of a resolution to the political uncertainty since the inconclusive Italian election was a factor, while in Spain an auction of three-month bonds attracted demand. Silvio Berlusconi is holding a healthy lead in the Italian opinion polls, according to new data released as president Giorgio Napolitano begins coalition talks. One poll has Berlusconi's People of Freedom party ahead by 8%. Alberto Nardelli, Italian political expert, tweets the details: And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. A row is brewing in Brussels after the European Commission denied that president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso pulled a u-turn yesterday when he said that Europe's austerity programme had reached the limits of public acceptance. The EC has released a full transcript of the comments, made at a think tank event in Brussels. Austerity and growth debate: What President Barroso actually said at the Brussels Think Tank Dialogue. They confirm that Barroso did state that the current approach to deleveraging Europe's 'unsustainable' debts was nearing its limits: (as we reported yesterday here). Barroso said: So while this policy is fundamentally right, I think it has reached its limits in many aspects, because a policy to be successful not only has to be properly designed. It has to have the minimum of political and social support. And when asked to clarify by our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, Barroso stated that Europe's programme of deficit reduction had to be \"complemented by a stronger emphasis on growth and growth measures in the shorter term: We have been saying this, but we should say it louder and clearer. If not, even if the policy of correction of the deficit is basically correct, we can always discuss the fine-tuning, the rhythm or the pace, but that will not be sustainable politically and socially. That's pretty clear, thanks. So, fast-forward to Brussels where an EU spokesman has also just told the assembled Press Pack that Barroso hasn't changed his position: Really? Ian, for one, isn't convinced: Neither is the WSJ's Matina Stevis (who moderated Barroso's session). She also argues that backtracking is an blunder: And Re-Define's Sony Kapoor speculates that Barroso's comment may not have pleased the German government: The continuing fall in Eurozone output this month (see 9.19am) led by Germany's shrinking private sector seconomy, shows that there's no improvement in Europe's woes. Analysts believe an ECB interest rate cut looks likely, but that probably won't be enough to turn the situation around. Here's the latest reaction: Carsten Brzeski of ING: The eurozone\u2019s economic engine is stuttering... The weather and, much more important, disappointing Chinese activity, are still having a stranglehold over the German economy. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale: At the margin, it is good news that we saw the divergence between Germany and France partially unwound, with German data coming out soft. But the underlying story is that one of the best indicators of what is happening to growth suggests a mild depression continues, getting neither better, nor worse. There will be debate about whether the ECB will cut rates further, though I doubt that would make any economic difference (except to the very front end of the Euro curve). But the ECB won't be tightening for a very, very long time indeed! Peripheral bond markets continue to rally and that in turn means FX models don't point to any great danger to the Euro, though I still think a weaker currency is needed, and inevitable if I am patient enough. Richard Driver of Caxton FX: This is yet more lacklustre data from the eurozone; the pace of contraction in France may be slowing but Germany is the one we are all interested in and the picture there looks very bleak indeed. The chances of a German and pan-European bounce back in Q2 are looking pretty remote right now. If the ECB don\u2019t respond by cutting interest rates next month then you have to wonder how bad things have to get before they do bite the bullet. This should keep the euro under the cosh in the coming weeks. Cyprus's finance minister has attempted to calm fears over its bailout by insisting that MPs are certain to approve the deal when it comes to a vote in the coming days. In an interview with Reuters, finance minister Harris Georgiades argued that the Nicosia parliament has already taken most of the difficult decisions (such as restructuring its banking sector and raising corporation tax) Georgiades said: I think parliament will acknowledge there is no alternative at this point. We don't have a date for this vote yet - except that it is not expected before this Friday. Georgiades suggested that the current restrictions on cash withdrawals and movement of capital could be eased within a few months. Asked whether measures would be eased in two, or six months, Georgiades said: \"Definitely not six months. I am optimistic we shall be able to proceed much sooner Georgiades added that Cyprus was in no rush to start selling its gold reserves to raise \u20ac400m towards its reform plan, calling the sale: ...not even the most important, or the issue of the greatest magnitude. Perhaps they're waiting until the gold price has recovered (it's down 0.5% today at $1,413 per ounce) Reuters' full interview is here: Gold sale not a priority - Cyprus finance minister German sovereign debt has risen in value this morning, pushing down the yield on its 10-year bonds to a new record low: The German stock market has fallen 0.4% as traders avoid risk and digest the news that Germany's private sector is contracting. In France, though, the main market is up 1% on relief that its downturn has eased. Here's a round-up: German DAX: down 24 points at 7453, - 0.3% FTSE 100: up 30 points at 6,311, up 0.5% French CAC: up 37 points at 3687, +1% Spanish IBEX: up 84 points at 8112, +1% Italian FTSE MIB: up 101 at 16123, +0.6% Britain managed to slice \u00a3300m off its budget deficit last year, according to the latest Public Finances figures. The Office for National Statistics reported that the Public Sector Net Borrowing requirement (when various one-off items and financial interventions are excluded) came in at \u00a3120.6bn for the 2012-13 financial year. That's a small improvement on the \u00a3120.9bn in the previous year. Last year's deficit was equal to 5.57% of GDP, according to the ONS's figures. The UK's total national debt rose to \u00a31.1858trn, or 75.4% of GDP (when the cost of financial sector interventions is ignored). City economists aren't terribly impressed: Howard Archer of IHS: Some modestly good news for the Chancellor as the public deficit for 2012/13 came in marginally below the 2011/12 outturn and slightly less than the OBR had estimated in the budget. Mind you the rate of improvement in 2012/13 makes a snail look fast, but at least the Chancellor can say the finances moved in the right direction! Here's more reaction to today's PMI data: Sweden's jobless rate has jumped,in another signal that the European economy is struggling. The unemployment rate in Sweden rose to 8.8% in March, up from 8.5% the previous month. Young people bore the brunt of the labour market, with the unemployment rate for people aged 15-24 rising to 28.1%, from 25.15 a year ago. Statistics Sweden said this was due to an increase in the number of full-time students who are now full-time student job seekers, unable to find employment. At 8.8%, Sweden's overall unemployment rate is rather lower than the 12% recorded in the eurozone last month. Economist Howard Archer of IHS reckons that the ECB is likely to cut interest rates, perhaps as early as next week, following today's data: The ECB indicated at its April policy meeting that it is increasingly open to taking interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50%, and latest comments by senior ECB policymakers indicate that that an interest rate cut could well occur if Eurozone economic activity continues to disappoint. The April purchasing managers surveys certainly seem to fit the bill for an ECB interest rate cut and we believe there is a strong chance that the ECB will act as soon as its 2 May meeting. If the ECB does hold fire on interest rates at its May meeting next week, this looks increasingly likely to be only delaying the inevitable. Hard to believe a quarter-point rate cut would really bring much cheer to the eurozone, though. Germany has been dragged deeper into Europe's economic crisis, as the eurozone's private sector continues to contract at the same rate as in March. That's the broad message from today's PMI data, with France's better-than-expected performance overshadowed by the deterioration in Germany. Here's Markit's overall PMI data (combining the data from France and Germany). Eurozone service sector PMI: 46.6, up from March's 46.4 Eurozone manufacturing PMI: 46.5, down from March's 46.8 Eurozone composite PMI: 46.5, marching March's 46.5. As Markit explained, the region's two largest member states are showing \"divergent trends\". While France saw the rates of decline in both business activity and new business ease sharply to the slowest for four and eight months respectively, Germany saw both activity and new business fall at the steepest rates for six months. The drop in German activity was also notable in being the first since last November. Elsewhere across the region output fell at the slowest rate for three months in April, though the rate of loss of new business remained marked. And in further gloom, firms cut payroll numbers (ie, the number of people they employ) for the 16th month in a row. The euro has fallen since Germany's poor PMI data hit the wires, down amost one cent against the US dollar at $1.298. The European Central Bank may respond with an early cut in interest rates, as Owen Callan of Danske Bank Markets explains: This graph from Markit, of Geman PMI data versus economic growth, shows why today's weak data (see 8.38am) could herald a contraction in GDP this quarter. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, warned that Germany's private sector has been weaking in recent months - leading to today's surprise fall in output (see 8.38am). The data suggests the German economy could shrink this quarter, Moore explained. He added that German industry is clearly suffering from the crisis in the eurozone periphery: Weaker demand was attributed to subdued business confidence across the euro area, with clients cutting spending amid concerns about the economic outlook for southern Europe. In the manufacturing sector, there were also reports that destocking efforts had led to reduced production requirements. Germany's private sector is shrinking for the first time since last November, with its services and manufacturing sectors both reporting much weaker than expected PMI data. Both readings came in below the 50-point mark -- showing a contraction in Europe's largest economy. German service sector PMI: 49.2, down from March's 50.9. German manufacturing PMI: 47.9, down from March's 49. German composite PMI: 48.8, down from 50.6 in March That is rather alarming news for Angela Merkel's government... More to follow. that' The weak Chinese PMI data released overnight sent shares sliding, with the Shanghai composite index closing 2.6% lower. The data has reinforced fears that the Chinese economy is slowing. CNBC has the full details: here's a flavour: China's flash HSBC PMI fell to a two-month low of 50.5 in April from 51.6 in March \u2013 compared with expectations for a fall to 51.5. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity and one below 50 signals contraction. \"It's a big miss. Confidence in the outlook for China has really diminished, particularly after first quarter growth data,\" said Tim Condon, head of research for Asia at ING. \"People are now reforming their views on economy. The new view is that growth will be stagnant,\" he added. France's private sector has suffered a bruising two years now, as this graph from today's PMI data shows: The French business people interviewed by Markit were more optimistic than in March, predicting a \"modest expansion of activity\" over the next 12 months: Panellists expressed hope that market conditions will improve, although there remained concerns over the generally poor economic climate. The full release is here (pdf) Europe's stock markets have opened a little higher on the back of the French PMI data (FTSE 100 is up 10 points). There's relief that the downturn in Europe's second-largest economy isn't worse. But as Re-Define's Sony Kapoor points out, France's private sector is still shrinking: Just in: France's manufacturing and service sectors are still shrinking -- but the pace of the downturn is slowing. French manufacturing PMI: 44.4 in April, up from 44.0 in March. An eight-month high. French services PMI: 44.1, up from 41.3 in March. A four-month high. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson told Reuters that the worst may be over for French firms: They're seeing obviously very weak demand and thinking it can't get any worse, surely it will get better... Policymakers won't allow a further collapse. A quick explainer of how the PMI data is calculated, and what it shows: \u2022 Markit, the financial data firm, interviews purchasing managers across the private sector to find if their business conditions are better, worse, or the same than last month. \u2022 That information is used to generate the PMI for each sector. \u2022 A PMI of 50 means the sector was flat -- anything higher shows growth, while a PMI below 50 indicates that economic activity fell. And this month, economists predict that the overall composite eurozone PMI (combining services and manufacturing) will come in at 46.5, the same as March. That would mean Europe's private sector is continuing to contract. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Eurozone financial crisis, and other key events across the world economy. It's a big day for data. Purchasing Managers Index reports from across the eurozone will show how manufacturers and service sector companies are performing this month. Economists expect the PMIs to confirm that the eurozone's private sector is still shrinking, as many European countries struggle to come out of recession That would put more pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates, or even consider more unconventional measures. The data will also provide fresh fodder for the raging debate on whether the eurozone should slow the pace of its austerity programme. As we reported yesterday, even EC president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso is now hinting at a change of approach.... We get French PMIs shortly, at around 8am BST. Germany's data comes 30 minutes later, followed by the figure for the whole eurozone at 9am BST (10am CET). China has already reported its PMIs for April, and they were rather lower than expected. The Chinese flash HSBC PMI fell to a two-month low of 50.5 in April from 51.6 in March. That has knocked stock markets in Asia overnight (more to follow). Also coming up today... Italy's president, Giorgio Napolitano, will hold meetings in an effort to form a new government. And UK public finances (at 9.30am BST) will show how Britain is faring. We'll be tracking all that, and other developments across the eurozone and beyond....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Chancellor George Osborne was \"spared blushes\" thanks to a slightly better-than-expected outturn for last year's public finances, economists said, after official data showed the deficit edged lower. In a week that will reveal if the UK has slipped into an unprecedented triple-dip recession, there was some relief for the Treasury from news the budget gap just beat market expectations. The deficit for the financial year 2012-13 also met predictions by the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), saving the government further embarrassment after a series of attacks on its austerity drive in recent days. Still, economists said the gap in the public finances was way above levels envisaged when the austerity drive was launched. Echoing criticism from the International Monetary Fund, they also warned it was unlikely to improve much over this year. \"The UK public finances data spares the chancellor's blushes,\" said Martin Beck at Capital Economics. \"But the fact that borrowing has come in a tiny bit under the OBR's forecast \u2013 which, of course, was heavily revised up during the course of the last fiscal year \u2013 is neither here nor there. The big picture is that the government still ran an underlying deficit of almost 8% of GDP. And note that in the first forecast produced by the OBR for the present government back in June 2010, borrowing in 2012/13 was expected to be only \u00a389bn.\" The Office for National Statistics said public sector borrowing came in at \u00a3120.6bn in 2012-13, \u00a3300m lower than in 2011-12, once special factors such as the transfer of the Royal Mail pension fund and profits from quantitative easing were excluded. The full-year figures were published with data showing a better-than-expected outturn for March. The OBR, the Treasury's independent forecaster, said at the time of the March budget that it expected an unchanged annual deficit of \u00a3120.9bn, on that measure. The figures on Tuesday mean Osborne has, by a whisker, achieved his promise that his austerity measures would bring year-on-year cuts in the UK's annual deficit. They also showed government spending rose at a slightly slower pace than the OBR had forecast. The official data come just days after Fitch Ratings became the second major international agency to strip the UK of its top-notch credit rating. In a blow to the government, Fitch cut the rating to AA+ from AAA, citing a weaker economic and fiscal outlook. The government also came under pressure from the IMF last week, which urged Osborne to rethink his austerity strategy in the wake of weak economic figures. Critics of the government's austerity drive say it risks being self-defeating by knocking growth so much that income from various taxes will fall while spending on benefits will have to rise. Economists noted the latest public finance data showed taxes on income and wealth fell last year while income from North Sea oil production was weak. \"The big picture is that fiscal consolidation has got stuck in the mud of near-zero GDP growth,\" said David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas. \"The fiscal consolidation effort has blown well off course over the last few years. Largely those winds have been coming from Europe, but at least some \u2013 the failure to sort the banking system out for example \u2013 are home grown.\" The Treasury sought to highlight the improvement in the deficit on a year earlier. \"Though it is taking time, the government is fixing this country's economic problems. The deficit is down by a third, a million and a quarter new private sector jobs have been created and interest rates are at near-record lows,\" said a spokesperson. But the opposition Labour party seized on the \"essentially\" unchanged picture for the public finances. \"These figures show that the government's failed economic policies have been totally self-defeating as a flat-lining economy has seen deficit reduction grind to a halt,\" said Chris Leslie MP, Labour's shadow financial secretary to the Treasury. Official data for first quarter GDP are due on Thursday and economists on the whole believe the UK will have eked out some growth, thereby narrowly avoiding a triple-dip recession.",

      "bodyText": "Discount clothing retailer Primark is again the driving force behind better than expected results at parent company Associated British Foods. Primark, which opened 15 new stores in the first half including a second outlet on London's Oxford Street, reported a 24% rise in first half sales - a 7% increase on a like-for-like basis after a good Christmas and despite the cold spell at the start of the year. Operating profits at the retailer rise from \u00a3154m to \u00a3238m. Primark is also making a successful push into continental Europe and next year it will open its first stores in France. Primark helped ABF record a 10% rise in interim revenues to \u00a36.3bn and a 20% increase in operating profits to \u00a3496m. Its grocery businesses performed well in a tough consumer market while profits at the sugar division benefited from higher volumes and prices. But it warned that it had already seen lower prices in China this year and it expected growing pressure in the EU and some African countries. As for Primark, ABF admitted it had been helped by lower cotton prices in the first half and better exchange rates. With a rising US dollar it expected some pressure on margins, while the pace of new store openings will also slow down. ABF's shares have climbed 63p to \u00a319.13. Martin Deboo at Investec said: The first half has beaten our expectations by around 4%, with the two big divisions of Primark and sugars both ahead.
