      "bodyText": "Tesco has agreed to sell its Harris + Hoole coffee shops, less than four years after investing in the launch of the business and a few months after taking full control. The sale of the artisan-style chain to Caff\u00e8 Nero is chief executive Dave Lewis\u2019s latest disposal of one of several peripheral businesses that were bought \u2013 often to the mystification of customers and analysts \u2013 by his predecessors. Earlier this month, Lewis sold the Giraffe restaurant chain and Dobbies garden centres as he sought to concentrate management attention on the task of turning round Tesco\u2019s neglected UK grocery stores. Tesco invested in Harris + Hoole when it launched in 2012, taking a 49% stake with the rest owned by sibling founders Nick, Laura and Andrew Tolley. Philip Clarke, then Tesco\u2019s chief executive, was continuing the company\u2019s record of spreading its tentacles into apparent growth opportunities as consumer tastes moved upmarket and Britons started drinking more coffee. Clarke was also looking for ways to attract shoppers back to Tesco\u2019s underused out-of-town superstores. Harris + Hoole seemed to offer a way to turn the weekly shop into a leisure experience. The \u00a350m deal the following year to buy Giraffe, the child-friendly restaurants that cater for middle-class families, had a similar aim. Tesco bought Dobbies in 2007 under the leadership of Sir Terry Leahy. But neither Giraffe nor Harris + Hoole has proved a success. Both businesses are loss-making and neither fit well with Tesco\u2019s stores or customers. Both were sold for undisclosed sums. Dobbies, which makes money, went for \u00a3217m. Harris + Hoole became a source of controversy for Tesco when customers, initially enticed by the independent feel of its outlets, found the chain was owned by a retailer with a reputation for crushing smaller local competitors. Tesco bought out the Tolleys in February in what looked like a commitment to keep hold of Harris + Hoole amid a wholesale restructuring under Lewis. In the end, doing so made it easier to sell the coffee chain. The sales leave Tesco owning Euphorium, the upmarket bakery launched in Islington, north London, in the late 1990s. Analysts suggest the bakery, which Tesco took full control of last year, is another candidate for sale. Phil Dorrell, a partner at consultants Retail Remedy, said Clarke incorrectly believed businesses such as Harris + Hoole would help support flagging sales at Tesco stores. \u201cYou can\u2019t cover that issue [falling sales] by doing something else,\u201d he said. \u201cThey needed to divest themselves of all that and to focus on retailing.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "ExxonMobil\u2019s deal to secure \u201cthe Crown Jewels\u201d of Nigerian oil reserves is under investigation by the west African country\u2019s economic and financial crimes commission, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. Exxon, the world\u2019s largest oil company, secured the lucrative oil rights in 2009 by beating out China\u2019s fourth-largest oil producer for access, despite apparently underbidding its rival bid by $2.25bn. A letter provided to the Guardian addressed to an Exxon subsidiary from Nigeria\u2019s federal ministry of petroleum resources shows the accepting of a 2009 bid of $1.5bn for a 20-year lease on the Oso, Ekpe, Edop and Ubit oil fields, which produce about 580,000 barrels a day between them \u2013 close to a third of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production of about 1.8m barrels a day, according to Opec. Local Exxon rival Sunrise Power &amp; Transmission, at the time a consortium of Nigerian and Chinese interests that included the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), bid $3.75bn for the same rights, according to a letter from Sunrise to the Nigerian president. The deal was reported to the Nigerian authorities by Lanre Suraju, a Nigerian anti-corruption activist and chairman of the Civil Society Network Against Corruption. Suraju said he was passed documents related to the deal by a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d after his June 2015 petition to investigate the bid was made public. Suraju was the recipient of a letter dated 17 August 2015 in which the authorities confirm they are investigating the deal. The documents were given to the Guardian by international watchdog group Global Witness, which said it had confirmed the investigation with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC told the Guardian it could not comment on the existence of an investigation, though Suraju said that as of last week \u201cthe EFCC has progressed impressively on the matter\u201d. Revelations about the investigation come at a sensitive moment for the oil industry: the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently considering a rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that would require energy companies to disclose the specific payments, down to the level of the individual project, that the firms make to foreign governments in order to secure lucrative mining and drilling rights. Dominic Eagleton of Global Witness said his organization wants to support greater transparency in international oil deals and hopes the SEC rule passes as proposed. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that the US introduces strong transparency rules to bring these deals into public view, enabling citizens in Nigeria and other oil-rich nations to hold their governments and companies to account for how the money is used,\u201d he said. Exxon has argued to the SEC that the new rule disregards a court ruling against the regulator \u201cand the many comments, concerns, and good-faith proposals for alternative approaches put forward by industry\u201d. An internal memo signed by executives of the nation\u2019s state-run oil firm, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), shows Exxon\u2019s local subsidiary Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN) originally tried to acquire a 25-year license to receive billions of dollars of oil for just $75m, saying they had expected the price for the lease renewal to be \u201cmillions not billions\u201d. The three oil-mining leases, or OMLs, renewed in 2009 at the end of a 40-year lease, are for shallow-water offshore lots of oil-rich real estate labeled blocks 67, 68 and 70. Production at the properties is very high, according to reports. Assuming the leased properties generate that many barrels every day of the year at an average of $50 a barrel, the gross revenue from ExxonMobil\u2019s 40% stake in the wells would come to $4.2bn annually. The properties also produce natural gas. \u201cMobil Producing Nigeria takes strong exception to these allegations,\u201d Lauren Kerr, the operations media relations manager for ExxonMobil, told the Guardian. \u201cMobil Producing Nigeria fully complied with the requirements outlined by Nigerian law for the renewal of oil mining licenses 67, 68 and 70. Nigerian law, as prescribed under the Petroleum Act, outlines the processes and procedures for an oil mining license renewal in the country. Within this framework an agreement between the Nigerian government and MPN was reached and legally executed. \u201cWe have noted the same to Global Witness. \u201cThe company adheres to the highest standards of business conduct, and to imply so without evidence is grossly irresponsible.\u201d CNOOC said it would not comment on the specifics of the deal, though spokeswoman Irene Gao said the company had learned from the experience: \u201cIn the future, the Company will attach more importance to the organic development of overseas assets and further optimize its overseas portfolio,\u201d Gao told the Guardian. For the year ending 2015, ExxonMobil reported realizing $12.2bn from all of its Nigerian assets in sales and other operating revenue. Just two months before the renewal, the Financial Times reported that Tanimu Yakubu, economic adviser to Nigeria\u2019s former president Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, had said that Chinese bidders \u201care really offering multiples of what existing producers are pledging [for licences] \u2026 we love to see this kind of competition\u201d. But the leases stayed with Exxon to the consternation of Leno Adesanya, at the time the chairman of Sunrise Power &amp; Transmission, a consortium of local and Chinese interests that included CNOOC. \u201cIn the case of ExxonMobil\u2019s OML 67, 68 and 70, our consortium offered $3.75bn for 40% equity interest in oil reserves,\u201d Adesanya wrote to Nigeria\u2019s current president, Muhammadu Buhari, last July according to one letter provided to the Guardian. The letter goes on to say that the company had offered $18.75bn for a 100% interest in the same properties \u2013 under the original agreements, the wells are a joint venture in which 40% of the oil goes to Mobil Producing Nigeria, and the other 60% to Nigeria\u2019s state oil company. A letter from 31 August 2009, little more than two months before the acceptance of the lower bid, details the $18bn bid from Sunrise and seems to assert the Chinese firm\u2019s ability to handle the daunting logistics of changing ownership from Exxon, though it does not directly refer to its competitor: \u201cIt is important to emphasize that Sunrise, CNOOC and the other constituent members of the Consortium are not only capable of funding petroleum operations in the respective OMLs, but have the technical know-how to undertake and carry out petroleum operations as required by international petroleum oilfield practices.\u201d Exxon\u2019s current rights are based on a disputed November 2009 deal, the negotiation of which was the subject of an inquiry by Nigeria\u2019s now former oil minister Diezani Alison-Madeuke, who said at the time she would recall the agreement since they had only been signed by a junior minister, Henry Odein Ajumogobia, and had never been countersigned by the senior oil minister, the late Rilwanu Lukman. A letter from Ajumogobia sets the price of the Exxon deal at $1.5bn, though it was widely reported as costing only $600m. Alison-Madeuke, later the president of Opec, was arrested in London last October by Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency as part of a corruption investigation. She was released on bail and did not appear before a magistrate in October, citing health concerns. The documents appear to include pages one and three of an initial agreement from Ajumogobia confirming the renewal of the leases. Page two has been withheld; Suraju said he believes that it contains terms outlining the construction of a power plant, which the government presented as evidence that it had driven a hard bargain when pressed to investigate the deal for corruption. Local news reports citing Nigerian officials value the power plant at $900m, which Suraju believes accounts for the difference between the $600m reported and the $1.5bn described in the letter to MPN from Ajumogobia. The design contract for the power plant was awarded in 2009. In 2010, the NNPC announced groundbreaking on the project. An article published Tuesday described progress on the power plant, located at ExxonMobil\u2019s Qua Iboe terminal in Akwa Ibom state, as \u201cslow\u201d. One of the documents obtained by Suraju is a memo signed by officials of the national oil firm, the NNPC, describing the negotiations with Exxon. \u201c[T]hese blocks, particularly OMLs 67, 68 and 70 are the most prolific portfolio of hydrocarbon assets in offshore Niger-Delta,\u201d the government\u2019s representatives said. \u201cThey are rightly referred to as the \u2018Crown Jewels.\u2019\u201d Exxon\u2019s lease on the blocks was set to expire in November 2009, and renegotiating that agreement was of paramount importance to the west African nation. \u201c[T]hese blocks represent the last remaining shallow-water resources of this magnitude in the Nigerian continental shelf and therefore lease renewal represents a unique opportunity for value capture for the Government,\u201d the report\u2019s authors wrote. Assuming a long-term minimum oil price of $50 a barrel (Brent crude was trading for just over $50 a barrel on Thursday), the government asked for $2.55bn.",

The letter goes on to say that the company had offered $18.75bn for a 100% interest in the same properties \u2013 under the original agreements, the wells are a joint venture in which 40% of the oil goes to Mobil Producing Nigeria, and the other 60% to Nigeria\u2019s state oil company.</p> <p>A letter from 31 August 2009, little more than two months before the acceptance of the lower bid, details the $18bn bid from Sunrise and seems to assert the Chinese firm\u2019s ability to handle the daunting logistics of changing ownership from Exxon, though it does not directly refer to its competitor: \u201cIt is important to emphasize that Sunrise, CNOOC and the other constituent members of the Consortium are not only capable of funding petroleum operations in the respective OMLs, but have the technical know-how to undertake and carry out petroleum operations as required by international petroleum oilfield practices.\u201d<br></p> <p>Exxon\u2019s current rights are based on a disputed November 2009 deal, the negotiation of which was the subject of an inquiry by Nigeria\u2019s now former oil minister Diezani Alison-Madeuke, who said at the time she would recall the agreement since they had only been signed by a junior minister, Henry Odein Ajumogobia, and had never been countersigned by the senior oil minister, the late Rilwanu Lukman. A letter from Ajumogobia sets the price of the Exxon deal at $1.5bn, though it was <a href=\"https://next.ft.com/content/355075c0-e80d-11de-8a02-00144feab49a\">widely reported</a> as costing only $600m.<br></p> <p>Alison-Madeuke, later the president of Opec, was <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-nigeria-oil-arrest-idUKKCN0RW21820151002\">arrested in London last October</a> by Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency as part of a corruption investigation. She was released on bail and did not appear before a magistrate in October, citing health concerns.<br></p> <p>The documents appear to include pages one and three of an initial agreement from Ajumogobia confirming the renewal of the leases. Page two has been withheld; Suraju said he believes that it contains terms outlining the construction of a power plant, which the government presented as evidence that it had driven a hard bargain when pressed to investigate the deal for corruption.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/documentcloud/index.html?docid=2895221-2-Letter-From-CNOOC-Rep-With-3-75bn-Counter\" data-alt=\"Sunrise Power letter\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/documentcloud/index.html?docid=2895221-2-Letter-From-CNOOC-Rep-With-3-75bn-Counter\">Sunrise Power letter</a> </figure>  <p>Local news reports citing Nigerian officials value the power plant at $900m, which Suraju believes accounts for the difference between the $600m reported and the $1.5bn described in the letter to MPN from Ajumogobia.</p> <p>The design contract for the power plant was awarded in 2009.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s some twist of the knife. The board of BHS had already called Dominic Chappell a \u201cmythomaniac\u201d and \u201cPremier League liar\u201d. Now BHS chief executive Darren Topp has written to parliament about Chappell\u2019s attempts to put family flights to the Bahamas on the company\u2019s travel budget and use a \u00a390,000 loan from the company to meet a personal tax bill. In short, Chappell couldn\u2019t see the difference between his own money and BHS\u2019s, alleges Topp. It\u2019s all \u201cpathetic and petty\u201d, says Chappell, the man who bought BHS from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31. The business with the flights was about being out of the office and not having his credit card or bank log-in to hand, he said. He would have cleared the sum on his return and there was no intent to have the company pay. As for the loan, he\u2019d been working so hard that he hadn\u2019t been able to move the cash to the correct account; he gave the company a seven-day post-dated cheque, which cleared on time. The MPs examining the failure of BHS will have to pick the bones out of that exchange. But let\u2019s not get distracted. The focus of the inquiry is still the run-up to the sale of BHS, which looks more extraordinary as the evidence piles up. In the latest documents, Olswang, the law firm acting for Chappell, says that it was always understood, up until a month before the sale, that BHS was to be delivered free of the deficit in its pension fund \u2013 that is the deficit that has subsequently ballooned to \u00a3571m on one accounting measure. It is not fresh news that the terms of the deal changed, apparently because Green\u2019s Arcadia had not been able to deliver its intended restructuring of the pension scheme in time. But what\u2019s astonishing is that nobody seems to have been alarmed by this development. Chappell \u2013 it hardly needs saying \u2013 was monumentally stupid to agree to buy BHS with the pension deficit. But what were his advisers \u2013 Olswang and Grant Thornton \u2013 doing? They should have been screaming at their client not to be so reckless, insisting that he get a cast-iron guarantee from Green that Arcadia would be responsible for settling whatever deal that could be thrashed out with the Pensions Regulator. Instead, everybody seems to have accepted that Green\u2019s difficulty in delivering Project Thor \u2013 the proposed restructuring of the pension scheme \u2013 was merely a minor irritation and not a deal-breaker. That is despite the fact that Arcadia had laboured unsuccessfully for months on Thor the previous year, spending in excess of \u00a31m, according to Green. The level of disregard for the interest of the pensioners at the point the business changed hands is staggering. Green, who owned BHS for 15 years and should have tackled the deficit when it first appeared, clearly bears responsibility for filling the shortfall. It would be a disgrace if the Pension Protection Fund, which is funded by a levy on solvent schemes, is asked to contribute a single penny. But let\u2019s hope the MPs, when they report, give a verdict not just on Chappell\u2019s alleged shenanigans, but also the role of well-remunerated professional advisers. Shoppers are buying into Tesco\u2019s phoney farms after all Tesco\u2019s use of fictitious British-style farm names \u2013 like Boswell, Redmere, Woodside and Willow Farms \u2013 feels deeply misleading, as the National Farmers Union has argued. But the tactic seems to be working. Uproar over the bogus \u201cbrands\u201d didn\u2019t last long and the customers, hoodwinked or not, are buying the stuff. Trading in stores has stabilised and Tesco was able to report on Thursday a second quarterly rise in like-for-like sales in a row, which has not happened for half a decade. True, an improvement of 0.3% is only just discernible but it has happened in the face of strong deflationary winds. Chief executive Dave Lewis can claim to have stopped the rot in the sales line, which was his first priority. The price of stability can now be counted. There has been a 6% reduction in the cost of a weekly shop at Tesco since September 2014, says Lewis. It is a price that had to be paid, of course, since Tesco could no longer pretend that Aldi and Lidl were minor players in the supermarket game. But the open questions are whether \u2013 and, if so, when \u2013 shareholders can expect to enjoy the fruits of the overhaul. There are few signs yet. The share price is lower than when Lewis joined and there is no whiff of dividends being restored. He has met expectations, but not exceeded them. No wonder he is so reluctant to set hard short-term financial targets, or diverge from the message that \u201clong-term\u201d value will be created for investors. In the circumstances, he can\u2019t be surprised that small shareholders at yesterday\u2019s annual meeting were so irate about the \u00a318,000 taxi bill clocked up in eight months by Tesco Bank boss Benny Higgins. Lewis\u2019s answer was nonsense: just because the bank is based in Edinburgh does not mean Higgins, who was paid \u00a32.2m last year, needs to claim \u00a3389.85 to get himself from Soho hotel to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. There is \u201ca way to go\u201d to reduce travel costs when in the capital, Lewis eventually conceded. You bet.",

      "bodyText": "Retailer Hobbycraft has sewn up a rise in sales and profits after cutting prices to capitalise on the ongoing trends in arts and crafts, and home baking. Underlying profits at the 83-store chain soared nearly 63% to \u00a310.9m as sales increased by 7.6% to \u00a3152m in the year to 21 February. The arts and crafts group opened new stores but also enjoyed a near 5% rise in sales at established stores as TV programmes such as the BBC\u2019s The Great British Bake Off, The British Sewing Bee and The Great Pottery Throwdown have inspired adults and children to start creative projects. \u201cTV is a catalyst that kicks it off, then social media takes off afterwards and it gets its own momentum,\u201d said Catriona Marshall, chief executive of Hobbycraft. She said young adults were increasingly being inspired to have a go at traditional crafts such as sewing, knitting or crochet by seeing items they wanted on social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest. Despite troubles elsewhere on the high street, the \u00a33bn UK craft market is currently growing by 4.5% a year. Sales of sewing machines rose 11% over the year after a 30% increase the year before while sales of thread increased 30% as a new generation of people picked up skills their grandparents would have been familiar with from YouTube videos. \u201cIt has skipped a generation,\u201d Marshall said. Marshall said Hobbycraft had been able to capitalise on demand by cutting prices and improving its distribution and supply chain as well as finding better ways to communicate with customers. The group now has a 1.9 million-strong Hobbycraft Club, as well as a new initiative which helps fans share their creations online. Amid competition from pound stores and discounters, Hobbycraft now has 4,000 different products priced at \u00a31 compared with 200 to 300 two years ago. Selling online is also helping to boost sales. Hobbycraft\u2019s website increased sales by 36.4% over the year and Marshall said it was keeping up that pace of growth. Next month the company will begin selling abroad via its website as it aims to build online sales above the current 7% proportion. But store expansion will also step up. Marshall said four more Hobbycraft stores opened in 2015 and eight to 10 were planned this year.",

      "body": "<p>Retailer Hobbycraft has sewn up a rise in sales and profits after cutting prices to capitalise on the ongoing trends in arts and crafts, and home baking.</p> <p>Underlying profits at the 83-store chain soared nearly 63% to \u00a310.9m as sales increased by 7.6% to \u00a3152m in the year to 21 February.</p> <p>The arts and crafts group opened new stores but also enjoyed a near 5% rise in sales at established stores as TV programmes such as the BBC\u2019s The Great British Bake Off, The British Sewing Bee and The Great Pottery Throwdown have inspired adults and children to start creative projects.</p> <p>\u201cTV is a catalyst that kicks it off, then social media takes off afterwards and it gets its own momentum,\u201d said Catriona Marshall, chief executive of Hobbycraft.</p> <p>She said young adults were increasingly being inspired to have a go at traditional crafts such as sewing, knitting or crochet by seeing items they wanted on social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest.</p> <p>Despite troubles elsewhere on the high street, the \u00a33bn UK craft market is currently growing by 4.5% a year.</p> <p>Sales of sewing machines rose 11% over the year after a 30% increase the year before while sales of thread increased 30% as a new generation of people picked up skills their grandparents would have been familiar with from YouTube videos. \u201cIt has skipped a generation,\u201d Marshall said.</p> <p>Marshall said Hobbycraft had been able to capitalise on demand by cutting prices and improving its distribution and supply chain as well as finding better ways to communicate with customers. The group now has a 1.9 million-strong Hobbycraft Club, as well as a new initiative which helps fans share their creations online.</p> <p>Amid competition from pound stores and discounters, Hobbycraft now has 4,000 different products priced at \u00a31 compared with 200 to 300 two years ago.</p> <p>Selling online is also helping to boost sales. Hobbycraft\u2019s website increased sales by 36.4% over the year and Marshall said it was keeping up that pace of growth. Next month the company will begin selling abroad via its website as it aims to build online sales above the current 7% proportion.</p> <p>But store expansion will also step up. Marshall said four more Hobbycraft stores opened in 2015 and eight to 10 were planned this year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, tried to pay for a family holiday to the Bahamas on company expenses and took a \u00a390,000 loan from the department store chain to pay a personal tax bill, according to evidence submitted to MPs. The allegations were made by Darren Topp, chief executive of BHS, in a submission to the parliamentary committee investigating the demise of the company, which accuses Chappell of treating the retailer\u2019s money as if it was his own personal funds. However, Chappell said the claims were \u201cpathetic and petty\u201d and accused Topp of \u201cdeliberately lying\u201d to discredit him. The latest claims and counter-claims by Topp and Chappell are likely to infuriate BHS staff and creditors. BHS collapsed into administration in April, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving debts of more than \u00a31.1bn, including a \u00a3571m pension deficit. The demise of the company could cost the taxpayer \u00a336m in unpaid tax and redundancy payments. Topp alleges that Chappell created a \u201cclear nepotistic environment\u201d at BHS, bringing in friends and family into key positions, including his uncle as chairman. In a series of allegations about Chappell\u2019s conduct, he said Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt three times, tried to buy flights to the Bahamas for his family from the company travel budget. After Topp refused, Chappell asked for his salary to be paid early so he had the money for his holiday. The human resources department agreed to the payment on the basis of \u201chardship\u201d. Topp also alleges that Chappell instructed BHS\u2019s finance department to pay him a \u00a390,000 loan while the company\u2019s finance consultant, Michael Hitchcock, was on holiday. \u201cThis was at a time when cash resources were limited and needed to pay both suppliers and employees payroll,\u201d Topp said. \u201cChappell saw no distinction between the company\u2019s money and his own personal money; he saw them as one and the same. The level of financial governance shown by Chappell was very poor.\u201d Chappell hit back at Topp, saying he wanted to book the flights to the Bahamas through the company\u2019s travel agents because they were offering a competitive price. He he asked to pay for them on the company account because he had been out of the office for \u201ca number of days\u201d on the day they needed to be booked and did not have access to his credit card or bank log-in details. Chappell said he planned to pay for the trip when he returned but Topp blocked Chappell\u2019s request. \u201cThere was no intent whatsoever to have the company pay for my private travel, it was purely an issue of logistics,\u201d Chappell added. The former BHS owner said the early payment of his wages had been suggested by the company\u2019s management and that the \u00a390,000 loan was approved by Topp and repaid within seven days through a post-dated cheque that Chappell handed over when the loan was agreed. \u201cIt is absolutely childish for Darren Topp to suggest this when he often acted against the board\u2019s decisions,\u201d Chappell said of the allegations. \u201cIf these are the only two points that Darren Topp can find to suggest that I was running BHS bank account as my own bank account, it\u2019s pathetic and petty.\u201d Chappell alleged that Topp received a first-class rail season ticket worth between \u00a35,000 and \u00a36,000 and that BHS was paying for the insurance on his new Porsche car. Chappell said Topp did not have approval for this, although a spokesman for BHS said this was part of Topp\u2019s contract, which was negotiated with Chappell. Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, said the allegations against Chappell and his Retail Acquisitions consortium were quite extraordinary. The Labor MP added: \u201cWe are still elucidating the full story of the final collapse of BHS, but it happened under Dominic Chappell and RAL\u2019s [Retail Acquisitions\u2019] stewardship. They should account fully and properly for their decisions and actions, some of which appear quite extraordinary.\u201d Separate documents released by the committee from Olswang, Chappell\u2019s advisers, claim that Sir Philip Green forced Retail Acquisitions into buying BHS earlier than it wanted. Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions on 11 March 2015. Olswang states in a letter to the Pensions Regulator that on 5 March 2015 it was told by Arcadia, Green\u2019s retail business, that it needed to complete the deal \u201cimmediately\u201d when Retail Acquisitions wanted another four weeks to conduct due diligence. The deal was completed on 11 March. The document also claims that Retail Acquisitions only discovered on 26 February that it was buying BHS with the pension deficit, as opposed to Green restructuring it seperately. The evidence will raise further questions for Green about his handling of the sale of BHS and its pension deficit. It has been published as administrators warned that unsecured creditors to BHS, including landlords and suppliers, were likely to receive less than 3p for every \u00a31 owed. Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrator, delivered the news at a meeting for creditors in London on Thursday when it announced that FRP has been appointed as the second administrator after the Pension Protection Fund raised concerns. Malcolm Weir, the head of restructuring and insolvency at the PPF, said: \u201cAt the BHS creditors meeting we voted to appoint additional administrators to work with the current administrators. This is an unusual step, but one we regard as appropriate given the circumstances of this administration.\u201d A spokesman for FRP said: \u201cOnce appointed, we shall focus on investigations arising from the insolvency of BHS and look forward to working with Duff &amp; Phelps as they continue to focus on trading the business and exploring opportunities to maximise realisations for creditors.\u201d Creditors speaking outside the meeting expressed their frustration at the collapse of BHS, with one saying the interests of suppliers and landlords had been \u201ccompletely swamped\u201d by the PPF, which is by far the largest creditor owing to the state of the BHS pension fund. A representative for a home furnishings supplier said: \u201cThey [the PPF] are disenfranchising all the other creditors. The government wants all creditors to be protected but the government created PPF is riding roughshod over small independent creditors.\u201d The administrators told the creditors that they may get more than 3p in the pound if Green agrees a deal with the Pensions Regulator to make a cash injection into the BHS pension scheme. The allegations against Dominic Chappell in parliamentary evidence \u2022 Retail Acquisitions loaned \u00a31.5m to a company that owns the house that Chappell\u2019s father lives in. \u2022 Just days before BHS called in administrators, Chappell moved \u00a31.5m out of the company and into BHS Sweden, an unconnected company. The money has since been paid back. \u2022 Chappell put none of his own money into BHS. \u2022 Chappell organised a \u00a325m loan for BHS from a property company that led to the retailer paying back \u00a331m. He later took a personal loan from the same business.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Former JJB Sports boss Chris Ronnie has obtained a \u00a3105,000 discount on a confiscation order issued after he was convicted of fraud in 2014. In December, Ronnie was given three months to pay \u00a3633,000 after being convicted of fraud in 2014 or have an additional five years added to his four-year sentence. He was later given an extension to that timetable, giving him until June to make payment. It is understood Ronnie has now agreed to pay \u00a3527,484.70 after his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, which assessors had estimated was worth \u00a3170,000, was sold for less than \u00a380,000. Ronnie\u2019s defence team will now apply for that amount to be formally recognised and the confiscation order satisfied. A spokesman for the Serious Fraud Office, which took Ronnie to court, said it was expected that the amount handed over by Ronnie would be accepted as sufficient and he would avoid the additional five years in prison. A schedule of assets from which Ronnie was to secure his payment under the confiscation order included the Wilmslow property and a 50% share in a house in Marbella, Spain, as well as a Range Rover, a 258CR registration number, worth \u00a34,000, and a Rolex Cosmograph Daytona worth \u00a35,000. Ronnie was sentenced to four years in prison and banned from being a company director for eight years after a jury unanimously found him guilty of taking about \u00a31m in backhanders, then trying to cover up his crime. At the time of his conviction, the judge said Ronnie was guilty of a \u201cvery greedy\u201d fraud and had not shown \u201cany sign of remorse or even embarrassment\u201d. He was found guilty of three counts of fraud over three six-figure cash payments made to him by suppliers during his tenure as JJB chief executive and two charges of providing false information. The payments to Ronnie, which he partly used to buy a luxury holiday home in Florida that has since been sold, were not disclosed to the JJB board. The fraud came to light after JJB executives called in the Office of Fair Trading in 2009 \u2013 in exchange for immunity \u2013 to investigate the possibility that the chain had fixed prices on football shirts when Ronnie was at the helm with rival Sports Direct, the sportswear firm run by the Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley. The OFT brought in the SFO to help with its inquiries, which cleared Sports Direct of wrongdoing. Their investigation found that at the time the fraud was committed in 2007 and 2008, Ronnie owed more than \u00a311m to an Icelandic bank. He had borrowed the sum to acquire a 29% stake in JJB in 2007 alongside another investor. He then took charge of the company. Ronnie, a former executive at Sports Direct under Ashley, ran JJB between August 2007 and March 2009, during which time its share price slumped from more than \u00a32 to less than 3p. JJB never recovered from the period of decline under Ronnie and went on to collapse in September 2012, with the loss of thousands of jobs. The following month, it was announced that Sports Direct had purchased part of the business, including 20 stores, the brand and its website, for \u00a324m.",

He was later given an extension to that timetable, giving him until June to make payment.</p> <p>It is understood Ronnie has now agreed to pay \u00a3527,484.70 after his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, which assessors had estimated was worth \u00a3170,000, was sold for less than \u00a380,000.</p> <p>Ronnie\u2019s defence team will now apply for that amount to be formally recognised and the confiscation order satisfied. A spokesman for the Serious Fraud Office, which took Ronnie to court, said it was expected that the amount handed over by Ronnie would be accepted as sufficient and he would avoid the additional five years in prison.<br></p> <p>A schedule of assets from which Ronnie was to secure his payment under the confiscation order included the Wilmslow property and a 50% share in a house in Marbella, Spain, as well as a Range Rover, a 258CR registration number, worth \u00a34,000, and a Rolex Cosmograph Daytona worth \u00a35,000.</p> <p>Ronnie was sentenced to four years in prison and banned from being a company director for eight years after a jury unanimously found him guilty of taking about \u00a31m in backhanders, then trying to cover up his crime. </p> <p>At the time of his conviction, the judge said Ronnie was guilty of a \u201cvery greedy\u201d fraud and had not shown \u201cany sign of remorse or even embarrassment\u201d.<br></p> <p>He was found guilty of three counts of fraud over three six-figure cash payments made to him by suppliers during his tenure as JJB chief executive and two charges of providing false information.</p> <p>The payments to Ronnie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/20/former-jjb-sports-boss-chris-ronnie-convicted-1m-backhanders-suppliers\">which he partly used to buy a luxury holiday home in Florida</a> that has since been sold, were not disclosed to the JJB board.</p> <p>The fraud came to light after JJB executives called in the Office of Fair Trading in 2009 \u2013 in exchange for immunity \u2013 to investigate the possibility that the chain had fixed prices on football shirts when Ronnie was at the helm with rival Sports Direct, the sportswear firm run by the Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley. The OFT brought in the SFO to help with its inquiries, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/19/sfo-clears-sports-direct-jjb\">which cleared Sports Direct of wrongdoing</a>.</p> <p>Their investigation found that at the time the fraud was committed in 2007 and 2008, Ronnie owed more than \u00a311m to an Icelandic bank. He had borrowed the sum to acquire a 29% stake in JJB in 2007 alongside another investor. He then took charge of the company.</p> <p>Ronnie, a former executive at Sports Direct under Ashley, ran JJB between August 2007 and March 2009, during which time its share price slumped from more than \u00a32 to less than 3p.</p> <p>JJB never recovered from the period of decline under Ronnie and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/01/jjb-administration-shop-closures-job-losses\">went on to collapse in September 2012</a>, with the loss of thousands of jobs. The following month, it was announced that Sports Direct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/27/sports-direct-deal-buy-jjb-sports-stores\">had purchased part of the business</a>, including 20 stores, the brand and its website, for \u00a324m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Tesco has been forced to defend the taxi habit of its bank chief, Benny Higgins, at a stormy shareholder meeting that highlighted the disparity between executive and shopfloor pay. In May the Guardian revealed that Higgins spent more than \u00a318,000 on London taxis in just eight months last year being driven to upmarket restaurants, private members\u2019 clubs and the supermarket\u2019s various head offices. Shareholder Danny Gazzi said he was pleased staff and executives had received bonuses for returning the company to profit, but added: \u201cIt is notable however that while [CEO] Dave Lewis is being awarded a 250% bonus, staff are receiving 5%.\u201d Lewis was paid \u00a34.6m including a \u00a33m bonus last year. \u201cThe \u00a318,000 claimed just on taxi expenses in eight months by Benny Higgins as chief executive of Tesco Bank is a troubling contrast with the salaries of those on the shop floor,\u201d added Gazzi who is also a supporter of ShareAction, which campaigns for the wider adoption of the voluntary UK living wage, as advocated by the Living Wage Foundation. Lewis told the meeting on Thursday that Higgins\u2019s expense bill was a \u201clarge amount of money\u201d and had been reviewed in detail with the executive, who is in charge of the Edinburgh-based bank and regularly in London for business. Tesco had replaced a car service with a taxi contract and Lewis said the spending was within company policy. He added: \u201cWe have a way to go to reduce the cost of transporting colleagues around London when they are here on bank business.\u201d Another shareholder, Michael Mason-Mahon, raised Lewis\u2019s membership of the exclusive Wentworth golf club, which was listed among \u00a310,000 worth of membership benefits in the company\u2019s annual report. After the meeting, Lewis explained it was a corporate membership used to entertain suppliers but that it had been cancelled after one year as it was not used regularly enough. The scrutiny of director\u2019s pay and benefits came as the retailer reported its second consecutive quarter of UK underlying sales growth \u2013 its strongest run in more than five years. It also announced the disposal of the Harris + Hoole coffee chain to Caffe Nero. Lewis said the sale of the coffee brand was the end of the \u201csecond chapter\u201d of his turnaround and the company was now \u201cconcentrating on improving the performance of the assets it had retained\u201d. He said: \u201cWe sit here with no plans on our stocks for asset sales.\u201d The retailer said it had delivered a second quarter of positive like-for-like sales in the UK despite challenging market conditions. Lewis said the upturn was down to lower everyday prices, fewer promotions and improved fresh food products. Sales at UK stores open a year or more rose 0.3% in the three months to 28 May, adding to an increase of 0.9% in the preceding quarter that showed the first signs of revival at Tesco\u2019s ailing British business. Lewis also revealed the retailer had been preparing for any economic shock from a possible Brexit. It had not taken a public position on the referendum as it was an \u201capolitical\u201d organisation. \u201cWe have scenario-planned a number of different outcomes,\u201d said Lewis, who gave the example that a run on sterling would affect the cost of sourcing in some categories. \u201cThere is not a concrete corporate plan covering the eventuality of Brexit \u2026 in all scenarios we don\u2019t see a disproportionate effect on Tesco versus the rest of the market. There has not been a need to do anything pre-emptive.\u201d Lewis did not plan to mount an all-night vigil to follow the counting of votes but instead intended to \u201cgo to sleep early and wake up early\u201d. Tesco also flagged the contribution of the seven \u201cfarm brands\u201d launched earlier this year to its improving sales. The new labels, with fictitious names such as Woodside, Willow and Boswell Farms, were created for a new budget range of produce, meat and poultry designed to compete with discounters. Tesco said shoppers could save \u00a31.60, about 17%, off a basket of 10 items from the range. \u201cWe are encouraged by the progress we are making,\u201d said Lewis. Tesco\u2019s share price has drifted down this year as investors have worried about Lewis\u2019s ability to rebuild profitability. Tesco eked a pre-tax profit of \u00a3162m in the year to 27 February, but four years ago it was making a \u00a34bn annual profit. The shares closed up 1.35p on Thursday at 167.8p. Stifel analyst James Collins said the update showed steady progress being made at Tesco but added: \u201cWe expect no change to consensus forecasts. We remain of the view that Tesco is doing the right things to rebuild the brand and a sustainable profit base, but that UK margins will take longer to improve than originally hoped. We think the shares fairly reflect this at current levels.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "CMA energy market report expected to whip up storm of criticism", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The competition regulator is expected to face a storm of criticism when it recommends only minor changes to the energy market despite evidence of massive overcharging by the \u201cbig six\u201d suppliers. The scheduled publication of the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s report alongside the EU referendum result, after two years\u2019 research, has only heightened the suspicions of critics that the whole exercise has ended in a whitewash. \u201cIt\u2019s a damp squib, a bit of a nothing result,\u201d a leading energy analyst said of a report that is widely expected to endorse provisional findings released in March, and recommend price controls on prepayment meters and setting up a customer database to help rival suppliers target customers stuck on expensive default tariffs. The CMA launched its inquiry amid widespread anger that the large power companies were overcharging customers by \u00a31.7bn a year. There were calls for the owner of British Gas, Centrica, and the rest of the big six to be forcibly broken up and energy prices capped. But in the subsequent 24 months the market watchdog has been in almost constant retreat, under relentless pressure from the big six and after a significant fall in commodity costs filtered through to lower household energy bills. \u201cGiven the scale of the perceived problems, the remedies are not going to significantly change the structure of the industry. In fact the remedies could create new problems,\u201d said Peter Atherton, an independent energy consultant and former managing director of equity research at Jefferies investment bank. He added: \u201cTens of millions of pounds have been spent by the CMA and the companies themselves just to produce this low-key set of remedies.\u201d Atherton is not convinced about the value of plans to cap prepayment meter bills and introduce an industry-wide customer database controlled by the industry regulator, Ofgem. Emma Hughes from the Switched On campaign, which wants to establish publically owned local supply firms, said: \u201cWe were promised a detailed set of recommendations to transform the energy market; what we got was a whitewash. The only thing this investigation makes clear is the power of the big six to control regulators. The energy market provides no solutions to fuel poverty.\u201d Ben Jones, managing director of new independent supplier Extra Energy, was equally scathing. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence that the CMA has published these recommendations when news is dominated by the EU referendum. They have missed a golden opportunity to inject more competition into the energy market,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers rightly feel they are being ripped off by their energy supplier, but the only way they will get a better deal is by switching. The recommendations should have focused on making it much easier for customers to switch, and on introducing transparency over the deals available in the market.\u201d Others had already dismissed the CMA inquiry. Ovo Energy said it was a \u201cwaste of money\u201d. The recent verdict of Dieter Helm, a government energy adviser, is that \u201cthe big six energy companies have scored a great victory\u201d. The origins of the investigation were in a series of major rises in energy bills in 2012 and 2013. The increases led to growing anger about fuel poverty and a ferocious political row between Labour and the coalition government. The CMA was called in by Ofgem in the summer of 2014 after Labour pledged a price freeze should they win the general elections. But the big six, which account for more than 90% of gas and electricity customers, saw the investigation as a chance to prove the market was working fairly. As recently as last year the competition authority was claiming that 95% of customers had been overpaying for their energy and could save about \u00a3300 a year by switching away from a standard tariff to a cheaper one. More contentiously, it claimed earnings at the big six increased tenfold in the years from 2007 to 2013, with higher margins taken from loyal customers on standard tariffs. The watchdog originally said it wanted to introduce a temporary price cap across the whole market, but has since watered down the plan to only those on prepayment meters. At the same time it has recommended scrapping an initiative recently introduced by Ofgem to limit the number of tariffs any one company could offer to four, to avoid what was perceived as a confusing market that made it too difficult for customers to compare prices. The authority wants Ofgem to oversee a new database of customer information provided by the big six and others. Critics fear this will lead to a blizzard of junk mail marketing by rival power providers. Meanwhile some power companies criticise a failure by the CMA to undertake a new review of what they call the \u201cdark and misleading world\u201d of price comparison websites. Juliet Davenport, chief executive of Good Energy, said it was ridiculous that these sites operate without constraints but suppliers come under licensing arrangements. \u201cWe are trying to rebuild trust in the energy sector and encourage consumers to change to lower cost providers. Most consumers switch through the dark and misleading world of price comparison sites. \u201cPeople do not know what they are getting. The sites do not have to show the lowest prices and their assessments are purely based on prices rather than other considerations such as service levels. We need to have regulation of price comparison sites.\u201d The industry lobby group, Energy UK, and the CMA itself refused to comment abefore opublication of the report\u2019s final recommendations. The big six are Centrica, EDF Energy, E.ON, RWE npower, Iberdrola\u2019s Scottish Power and SSE.",

      "body": "<p>The competition regulator is expected to face a storm of criticism when it recommends only minor changes to the energy market despite evidence of massive overcharging by the \u201cbig six\u201d suppliers.</p> <p>The scheduled publication of the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s report alongside the EU referendum result, after two years\u2019 research, has only heightened the suspicions of critics that the whole exercise has ended in a whitewash.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a damp squib, a bit of a nothing result,\u201d a leading energy analyst said of a report that is widely expected to endorse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/watchdog-proposes-capping-gas-and-electricity-prices-for-4m-homes-on-pre-paid-meters\">provisional findings released in March</a>, and recommend price controls on prepayment meters and setting up a customer database to help rival suppliers target customers stuck on expensive default tariffs.</p> <p>The CMA launched its inquiry amid widespread anger that the large power companies were overcharging customers by \u00a31.7bn a year. There were calls for the owner of British Gas, Centrica, and the rest of the big six to be forcibly broken up and energy prices capped.<br></p> <p>But in the subsequent 24 months the market watchdog has been in almost constant retreat, under relentless pressure from the big six and after a significant fall in commodity costs filtered through to lower household energy bills.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the scale of the perceived problems, the remedies are not going to significantly change the structure of the industry. In fact the remedies could create new problems,\u201d said Peter Atherton, an independent energy consultant and former managing director of equity research at Jefferies investment bank.</p> <p>He added: \u201cTens of millions of pounds have been spent by the CMA and the companies themselves just to produce this low-key set of remedies.\u201d</p> <p>Atherton is not convinced about the value of plans to cap prepayment meter bills and introduce an industry-wide customer database controlled by the industry regulator, Ofgem.</p> <p>Emma Hughes from the Switched On campaign, which wants to establish publically owned local supply firms, said: \u201cWe were promised a detailed set of recommendations to transform the energy market; what we got was a whitewash. The only thing this investigation makes clear is the power of the big six to control regulators. The energy market provides no solutions to fuel poverty.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Jones, managing director of new independent supplier Extra Energy, was equally scathing.</p> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence that the CMA has published these recommendations when news is dominated by the EU referendum. They have missed a golden opportunity to inject more competition into the energy market,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cConsumers rightly feel they are being ripped off by their energy supplier, but the only way they will get a better deal is by switching. The recommendations should have focused on making it much easier for customers to switch, and on introducing transparency over the deals available in the market.\u201d </p> <p>Others had already dismissed the CMA inquiry. Ovo Energy said it was a \u201cwaste of money\u201d. The recent verdict of Dieter Helm, a government energy adviser, is that \u201cthe big six energy companies have scored a great victory\u201d. </p> <p>The origins of the investigation were in a series of major rises in energy bills in 2012 and 2013. The increases led to growing anger about fuel poverty and a ferocious political row between Labour and the coalition government.</p> <p>The CMA was called in by Ofgem in the summer of 2014 after Labour pledged a price freeze should they win the general elections. But the big six, which account for more than 90% of gas and electricity customers, saw the investigation as a chance to prove the market was working fairly. </p> <p>As recently as last year the competition authority was claiming that 95% of customers had been overpaying for their energy and could save about \u00a3300 a year by switching away from a standard tariff to a cheaper one.</p> <p>More contentiously, it claimed earnings at the big six increased tenfold in the years from 2007 to 2013, with higher margins taken from loyal customers on standard tariffs.</p> <p>The watchdog originally said it wanted to introduce a temporary price cap across the whole market, but has since watered down the plan to only those on prepayment meters.</p> <p>At the same time it has recommended scrapping an initiative recently introduced by Ofgem to limit the number of tariffs any one company could offer to four, to avoid what was perceived as a confusing market that made it too difficult for customers to compare prices.</p> <p>The authority wants Ofgem to oversee a new database of customer information provided by the big six and others. Critics fear this will lead to a blizzard of junk mail marketing by rival power providers.</p> <p>Meanwhile some power companies criticise a failure by the CMA to undertake a new review of what they call the \u201cdark and misleading world\u201d of price comparison websites.</p> <p>Juliet Davenport, chief executive of Good Energy, said it was ridiculous that these sites operate without constraints but suppliers come under licensing arrangements.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to rebuild trust in the energy sector and encourage consumers to change to lower cost providers. Most consumers switch through the dark and misleading world of price comparison sites.</p> <p>\u201cPeople do not know what they are getting. The sites do not have to show the lowest prices and their assessments are purely based on prices rather than other considerations such as service levels. We need to have regulation of price comparison sites.\u201d</p> <p>The industry lobby group, Energy UK, and the CMA itself refused to comment abefore opublication of the report\u2019s final recommendations. <br></p> <p>The big six are Centrica, EDF Energy, E.ON, RWE npower, Iberdrola\u2019s Scottish Power and SSE.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Investors have put their money on a remain vote in the EU referendum, as polling day trading lifted the pound to a new high for 2016 and the FTSE 100 rose to a two-month peak. As the market exuberance of recent trading sessions continued, there were fresh warnings that investors were setting themselves up for heavy losses in the event of Brexit when the outcome of the vote became clear on Friday. In morning trading on Thursday, the pound broke through $1.49 against the dollar for the first time since December, before easing back in the afternoon. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares added a solid 1.2%, or 77 points, to close at 6338, the highest since late April. \u201cClearly the key issue now for currency markets is whether rising expectations that the status quo will prevail are well-placed,\u201d said Chris Saint, senior analyst at the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cMost of the results from the local counting areas are expected by the early hours of Friday morning with the official outcome anticipated by around breakfast time. Dramatic exchange rate swings are to be expected regardless of the result, with a sharp drop in the pound\u2019s value possible in the event of a Brexit.\u201d Shares and the pound were higher from the open and got an extra fillip in morning trading after the publication of an Ipsos Mori poll for the Evening Standard newspaper showed a four-point lead for remain. The poll, which was conducted before voting began, helped lift sterling more than 1.5% to $1.4948 against the dollar. In later trading it had come off highs but was still up 0.6% on the day at $1.4799. \u201cEven though we all know that polls can be rubbish, the markets seem quite happy that the remain camp has done enough to win,\u201d said Kathleen Brooks, research director at the spread-betting firm City Index. The FTSE and pound have been buffeted by close opinion polls during the campaign but in the past week market sentiment has swung to show growing confidence in a vote to remain in the EU. The FTSE has rallied every day this week and by Thursday\u2019s close was up 5.3% for the week so far. The FTSE\u2019s gains were mirrored on other European bourses, with the leading share indices in Germany and France both up almost 2%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1% at the time of the London close. With polling stations open from 7am to 10pm, there were strict rules for broadcasters that meant they could not report details of campaigning until voting ended. The relative quiet following months of daily referendum news made for a tense atmosphere on City trading floors, said Joshua Mahony, an analyst at the online trading company IG. \u201cAmid restrictions to broadcasters, there is an eerie feeling in the City, with a nervous energy evident as we await the fate of the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever the result, volatility is likely to be the name of the game and rumours of private exit polls from the hedge funds means that there is likely to be some substantial swings as speculative positions are placed into a relatively illiquid market.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The ranks of the world\u2019s super-rich swelled to more than 15 million last year, led by Japan and China, where wealthy individuals appear to have prospered despite 2015\u2019s stock market turmoil. The Asia-Pacific region has for the first time overtaken North America both for the number of rich people and the wealth held by them, according to the annual world wealth report from consultancy firm Capgemini. Around the world, the number of \u201chigh net worth individuals\u201d (HNWIs) \u2013 defined as those with investable assets of at least $1m (\u00a3675,000) excluding their main home, art collection, vintage sports cars and other collectibles \u2013 rose nearly 5% in 2015 to 15.4 million. The combined wealth held by the global super-rich increased by 4% to $58.7tn, boosted by stock market gains in some parts of the world and higher property prices. However, the rate of growth in the wealth of HNWIs in North America slowed sharply last year, while in Brazil and Russia their numbers and wealth declined. The US still has the most HNWIs, almost 4.5 million. Japan is second, with 2.7 million, then Germany, with almost 1.2 million. China came fourth, with just over 1 million, followed by the UK, with 552,800 individuals, up 3,200 on 2014. The UK has been in the top five for some time. China had the biggest rise in the number of wealthy people, up 16% on the previous year. The increase was down to sustained economic growth and rising property prices. China\u2019s super-wealthy include Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce business Alibaba, and its richest man, the property tycoon Wang Jianlin. In the UK, the collective personal fortunes of the super-rich rose 1.1% last year to $2tn. Britain is among the top four markets expected to drive wealth growth through to 2025, behind China, the US and India, according to wealth managers polled by Capgemini. More than 4.5 million new HNWIs have been created globally since the height of the financial crisis in 2009. In Asia-Pacific, the wealth of the super-rich soared 10% to $17.4tn last year, outstripping North America, where it grew 2% to $16.6tn, down from the 9% in 2014. While the US and Canadian economies put in a solid performance, equity markets finished the year in negative territory. In contrast, after a year of sharp swings, the Shanghai Composite and the Nikkei each ended 2015 more than 9% higher. Japan and China together accounted for 60% of the growth in the number of millionaires around the world last year. Asia-Pacific is expected to account for two-fifths of the world\u2019s wealth within the next 10 years \u2013 more than that of Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa combined. David Wilson, wealth management expert at Capgemini, said this was driven by demographics, as Asia was approaching 3 billion people compared with half a billion in North America, as well as digital penetration. \u201cThe big story has been entrepreneurs in Asia,\u201d he added, while salary incomes and inheritance played an important role in Europe and the US. In the US, an estimated $59tn of wealth is being transferred to heirs, charities, estate taxes and estate closing costs between 2007 and 2061. Of that $36tn is going to heirs. Latin America was hobbled by the poor performance of Brazilian equities last year, posting a 2% fall in the number of HNWIs and a near-4% decline in wealth. Europe\u2019s growth was steady, at nearly 5% for both the number of millionaires and their wealth, led by Spain, the Netherlands, France and Germany. Brazil, battered by the commodity price slump, political turmoil and sharp falls in currency and equity markets, was the poorest performing country in the world, losing 8% of its millionaires. Canada, Russia, Mexico and Singapore also recorded declines of between 2% and 3%. Capgemini said it had taken longer than anticipated for Asia-Pacific to overtake North America as the region with the biggest amount of wealth because of the slowdown in China, India and other countries in recent years. An alliance of organisations including ActionAid, Greenpeace International, International Trade Union Confederation and Oxfam warned that while the wealthy prospered, 702 million people living in extreme poverty were being left behind by a \u201cbroken economic system\u201d. Jenny Ricks of the Fight Inequality Alliance said: \u201cLast year the wealth of the richest totalled $58.7tn, which is over 150 times the size of the economies of all of the world\u2019s poorest countries combined. This shows the extent money and power are concentrated in the hands of the wealthiest few. \u201cFor every person with more than $30m, there are over 4,800 people living in extreme poverty. This gross inequality is a symptom of an unjust and unfair economic system that allows the rich to get richer at the expense of the poor.\u201d The Capgemini report showed that the number of ultra-rich people \u2013 those with assets worth more than $30m \u2013 rose at a slower rate than in previous years. Their number grew by just over 4% in 2015, compared with annual increase of nearly 8% between 2010 and 2014. Their wealth grew 2.5% last year compared with an average of 6% in the previous four years, dragged down by Latin America. If current trends continue, the wealth held by the world\u2019s richest is projected to exceed $100tn by 2025 \u2013 nearly triple the amount in 2006, according to Capgemini. Despite the financial crisis, the millionaires\u2019 wealth has expanded almost fourfold over the last 20 years. Ricks called on governments to reverse cuts to public spending, privatisation, tax breaks for the wealthy and \u201cthe race to the bottom on human rights\u201d. Capgemini said an unexpected trend of the past 20 years had been the high levels of cash held by the world\u2019s richest. Despite overall strong stock market performance, millionaires have continued to hold almost a quarter of their financial wealth in cash \u2013 to fund their lavish lifestyles as well as to protect against market volatility.",

The UK has been in the top five for some time. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2016-06-23T13:51:03/embed.html\" data-alt=\"wealthy persons graph for china and japan\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2016-06-23T13:51:03/embed.html\">wealthy persons graph for china and japan</a> </figure>  <p>China had the biggest rise in the number of wealthy people, up 16% on the previous year. The increase was down to sustained economic growth and rising property prices. China\u2019s super-wealthy include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/19/jack-ma-profile-alibaba-powerful-humble-billionaire\">Jack Ma</a>, founder of e-commerce business <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/alibaba\">Alibaba</a>, and its richest man, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/29/chinas-richest-man-opens-wanda-world-to-rival-shanghai-disney\">property tycoon Wang Jianlin</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, the collective personal fortunes of the super-rich rose 1.1% last year to $2tn.

In contrast, after a year of sharp swings, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/20/global-market-turmoil-10-charts\">Shanghai Composite and the Nikkei each ended 2015 more than 9% higher</a>.</p> <p>Japan and China together accounted for 60% of the growth in the number of millionaires around the world last year. Asia-Pacific is expected to account for two-fifths of the world\u2019s wealth within the next 10 years \u2013 more than that of Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa combined.</p> <p>David Wilson, wealth management expert at Capgemini, said this was driven by demographics, as Asia was approaching 3 billion people compared with half a billion in North America, as well as digital penetration.</p> <p>\u201cThe big story has been entrepreneurs in Asia,\u201d he added, while salary incomes and inheritance played an important role in Europe and the US. </p> <p>In the US, an estimated $59tn of wealth is being transferred to heirs, charities, estate taxes and estate closing costs between 2007 and 2061. Of that $36tn is going to heirs.</p> <p>Latin America was hobbled by the poor performance of Brazilian equities last year, posting a 2% fall in the number of HNWIs and a near-4% decline in wealth. Europe\u2019s growth was steady, at nearly 5% for both the number of millionaires and their wealth, led by Spain, the Netherlands, France and Germany.<br></p> <p>Brazil, battered by the commodity price slump, political turmoil and sharp falls in currency and equity markets, was the poorest performing country in the world, losing 8% of its millionaires. Canada, Russia, Mexico and Singapore also recorded declines of between 2% and 3%.</p> <p>Capgemini said it had taken longer than anticipated for Asia-Pacific to overtake North America as the region with the biggest amount of wealth because of the slowdown in China, India and other countries in recent years.</p> <p>An alliance of organisations including ActionAid, Greenpeace International, International Trade Union Confederation and Oxfam warned that while the wealthy prospered, 702 million people living in extreme poverty were being left behind by a \u201cbroken economic system\u201d.</p> <p>Jenny Ricks of the Fight Inequality Alliance said: \u201cLast year the wealth of the richest totalled $58.7tn, which is over 150 times the size of the economies of all of the world\u2019s poorest countries combined. This shows the extent money and power are concentrated in the hands of the wealthiest few.</p> <p>\u201cFor every person with more than $30m, there are over 4,800 people living in extreme poverty. This gross inequality is a symptom of an unjust and unfair economic system that allows the rich to get richer at the expense of the poor.\u201d</p> <p>The Capgemini report showed that the number of ultra-rich people \u2013 those with assets worth more than $30m \u2013 rose at a slower rate than in previous years. Their number grew by just over 4% in 2015, compared with annual increase of nearly 8% between 2010 and 2014. Their wealth grew 2.5% last year compared with an average of 6% in the previous four years, dragged down by Latin America.</p> <p>If current trends continue, the wealth held by the world\u2019s richest is projected to exceed $100tn by 2025 \u2013 nearly triple the amount in 2006, according to Capgemini. Despite the financial crisis, the millionaires\u2019 wealth has expanded almost fourfold over the last 20 years.</p> <p>Ricks called on governments to reverse cuts to public spending, privatisation, tax breaks for the wealthy and \u201cthe race to the bottom on human rights\u201d.</p> <p>Capgemini said an unexpected trend of the past 20 years had been the high levels of cash held by the world\u2019s richest. Despite overall strong stock market performance, millionaires have continued to hold almost a quarter of their financial wealth in cash \u2013 to fund their lavish lifestyles as well as to protect against market volatility.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So the FTSE has closed up at the highest level since 21 April, at 6,338.1. The pound hit a six-month high against the dollar, rising above $1. 48 for the first time in 2016. Sterling is currently up 0.7% at $1.4807. It is also up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.3030. In the US, Wall Street is also making strong gains. Dow Jones: +1% at 17,958 S&amp;P 500: +1% at 2,107 Nasdaq: +1.1% at 4,451 That\u2019s it for today. Our main referendum blog is still running and covering all the key political developments: Thank you for joining us today. AM The FTSE 100 has staged a late rally as trading comes to a close for the day. Earlier in the day it was up by more than 100 points, but the majority of the gains were lost as investor nerves picked up - leaving the FTSE up just 18 points at one point. The FTSE has closed for the day at 6,338.1, up 77 points or 1.2%. Here is how things look at the close elsewhere in Europe: Germany\u2019s DAX: +1.9% at 10,257.03 France\u2019s CAC: +2% at 4,465.9 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +2.1% at 8,885.3 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +3.7% at 17,966.17 Andy Scott, economist at HiFX, has a good take on the pound: After clocking up an impressive rally of nearly 2% on Thursday - hitting a 6-month high against the US dollar as the polls showed a late swing to a Remain vote - sterling reversed course sharply this afternoon. GBP/USD fell 200 points from its high to $1.4750 as traders took profits on the earlier rally, positioning themselves cautiously ahead of a still uncertain outcome. Leading into this evening, we expect liquidity to fall further as banks reign in FX activity, especially in GBP transactions with no one wanting to get their fingers burnt by the expected big moves that are possible in either direction. We expect some initial reaction in Sterling to the exit polls after 10pm, with the main excitement likely to be in the early hours of Friday morning once we starting getting the results in. The pound is up 0.5% against the dollar at $1.4777. It\u2019s up 0.07% against the euro at \u20ac1.3024. Latest on the markets: Europe: FTSE 100: +0.6% at 6,301 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1.1% at 10,185 France\u2019s CAC: +1.1% at 4,428 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.2% at 8,806 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +2.7% at 17,798 Wall Street: Dow Jones: +0.9% at 17,946 S&amp;P 500: +0.7% at 2,101 Nasdaq: +1% at 4,447 Brits have been rushing to buy their holiday money according to No.1 Currency. The foreign exchange firm said business jumped by 70% on Wednesday, with queues forming at some of its 102 high street stores, and online sales up 300%. Simon Phillips, retail director at No.1 Currency: Demand has rocketed for all foreign currencies, but euros and dollars are proving especially popular. Our stores came close to running out of the most popular currencies on Wednesday, and as high demand continues today we\u2019ve dramatically increased stock levels to cope with the surge in demand during the final hours before the result is announced. So it appears that investors are feeling a little less bold this afternoon, with referendum jitters creeping back in. Connor Campbell of Spredex has a view: Things have calmed down somewhat since that midday frenzy, the European indices looking increasing nervy as closing time creeps closer. The indices receded from their midday peaks, instead returning to the calmer trading seen earlier in the morning. So, that\u2019s almost it. One imagines that regardless of the result tomorrow with be a far more hectic day of trading, be it caused by a post-Brexit plunge or a relieved wave of investors pouring back in to buy up the pound et al. UK investors are losing some enthusiasm now. The FTSE 100 is up 18 points or 0.3% at 6,278 - smaller gains than we saw earlier in the day when the FTSE was up more than 100 points at 6,371 at one point. The pound\u2019s gains against the dollar have also slowed, with sterling up 0.7% at $1.4810. It had hit a high of $1.4948 at one point on Thursday morning. More positive news on the US economy... this time from the manufacturing sector. The headline index on Markit\u2019s \u201cflash\u201d manufacturing PMI survey rose to a three-month of high of 51.4 in June, from 50.7 in May (where anything above 50 indicates expansion). Growth in exports was the main driver of growth. It was better than expected, with economists forecasting 50.8 for the headline index combing output, new orders and employment. Output in the sector grew modestly, and new business increased at an accelerated rate, boosted by the fastest pace in export sales since September 2014. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit responded with caution to the better-than-expected PMI: The flash PMI for June brought welcome news of improved performance of manufacturing, but the sector still looks to have acted as a drag on the economy in the second quarter, leaving the economy reliant on the service sector and consumers in particular to drive growth. Any improvement could be largely traced to better export sales, in turn linked to the weakening of the dollar compared to earlier in the year. Domestic demand was again worryingly weak, especially from business customers, meaning overall growth of order books remained subdued. US markets are up in early trading, echoing the upbeat sentiment in Europe. Dow Jones: +0.6% at 17,892 S&amp;P 500: +0.6% at 2,099 Nasdaq: +0.8% at 4,872 Away from the markets, US jobless claims fell more sharply than expected last week according to figures from the Labor Department. The number of new claims for unemployment benefits fell to 259,000 in the week ending 18 June, from 277,000 a week earlier. It was the biggest drop since February and close to a 43-year low touched in March. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting a smaller drop to 270,000. Wall Street is expected to open higher: On a lighter note, a horse named Brexit is taking to the turf at the Newbury racecourse tonight, at 6.10pm. But it\u2019s unlikely to triumph, with Betfair offering 12-1 odds on Brexit galloping home first. I mentioned earlier that the cost of insuring against the pound either plunging or soaring overnight had soared. That\u2019s still true. But, the cost of insuring against wild swings over the next week has fallen. That suggests investors are less worried about a sterling crisis kicking off tomorrow. Amid today\u2019s rally, some analysts are urging traders not to get carried away. Not a single vote has been counted yet. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy Swissquote Bank, says investors need to trade very carefully, and keep an eye on the North East city of Sunderland... One of the earlier constituencies to declare a result should be Sunderland, viewed as a Brexit bellwether. Should Sunderland result in a close result or an outright majority vote to \u201cremain\u201d, then it is assumed that a \u201cremain\u201d vote will triumph. By 05:00am BST, 80% of authorities are expected to have made their respective declarations, providing a clearer view of the outcome. Foreign exchange group UKForex has seen a 100% increase in consumers making transfers from the pound into other currencies, in the last 24 hours. The majority are transferring from sterling to euros. William Shepherd, global head of treasury at UK Forex, says some customers are concerned that the cost of buying a European property could rocket if the pound drops tomorrow. Shepherd explains: \u201cIf the UK opts to leave, the pound could fall as much as 20%. Consumers could lose up to \u00a31,398 on a \u00a310,000 transfer, compared to today\u2019s rate.\u201d David Cheetham of City firm XTB.com says the financial markets appear to have discounted the chance of Brexit over the last few days: The price movements so far this week in financial markets suggest that a victory in today\u2019s EU referendum for the leave camp has been given a very low probability, with the pound touching its highest level of the year against the US dollar this morning whilst the surge in the FTSE of late continues almost unabated. Rather than heeding caution and remaining on the sidelines until this potentially major event risk has passed, traders appear to be betting on remain prevailing and are positioning accordingly. Even the oil price is up this morning, as investors show more confidence about the global economy. Brent crude is up 1.7%, back over $50 per barrel at $50.71. Here\u2019s our latest news story on today\u2019s market moves, by Katie Allen: Another opinion poll just flashed up, also giving Remain the majority of support. Populous reports that 55% of people surveyed want to stay in the EU, while 45% want to leave. That\u2019s the biggest gap recorded in the final flurry of polls before today\u2019s vote, as polling expert Mike Smithson explains: The City isn\u2019t waiting for the EU referendum result before piling into the pound. Over at City firm ETX Capital, traders are getting ready for a referendum all-nighter. Joe Rundle, head of trading, says: \u201cWhatever the result, it\u2019s going to be a sleepless night for our traders as the results come in slowly on Friday morning. We\u2019ll be fully staffed overnight to cope with the increased trading and volatility. It\u2019s an incredible opportunity for traders to make big bets on the fortunes of the pound and other markets affected by the referendum such as the FTSE. A word of warning, however, as there could be some potentially wild gyrations in prices, particularly in sterling. Some banks are warning that they might fail to execute orders on their electronic trading platforms. We\u2019ve drawn up plans to deal with any increased volatility based on our positive experience of the Swiss franc turmoil last year, when the Swiss National Bank unpegged the currency from the euro. Wowzers, the pound has now broken through $1.49 for the first time since the end of last December. That\u2019s a gain of two whole cents today. Breaking: Ipsos MORI, the polling company, has just released its final opinion poll on the referendum. And it shows that 52% of those surveyed wanted to stay in the European Union, against 48% who favour Leaving. IMPORTANTLY, this is not an exit poll. That pushed the pound up to a new six-month high, of $1.488. The poll was conducted for the Evening Standard, who say: The four-point gap is nail-bitingly close - especially with heavy rain threatening to dampen turnout in London which is a key target area for Remain. Moreover, the research discloses that 12 per cent of people confess they might change their minds in the few hours left before they cast their vote, indicating how the historic decision has torn the country. The higher shares rise today, the more they could fall tomorrow if Leave win. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says: With the EU referendum polling commencing on Thursday, market volatility may be set to amplify to untold levels as speculation heightens over the United Kingdom\u2019s future in the European Union. Although stock markets were offered a lifeline this week amid the \u201cBremain\u201d optimism, most major stocks could be poised to decline lower if risk aversion and a potential \u201cBrexit\u201d encourages investors to scatter away from riskier assets. Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First flags up that currency trading is pretty light today. Many traders are keeping to the sidelines until the EU referendum result is known, to avoid being squashed by a fast-moving market. The pound is on a real tear this morning.... Britain\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index has just hit its highest level in two month, as traders continue to watch today\u2019s EU referendum unfold. The Footsie jumped by 110 points to 6371 points, a gain of 1.5%. That\u2019s its highest level since 21 April, before the EU referendum campaign came to the boil. The pound has just hit a new 2016 high too, up 1.5 cents at $1.4862. The rally is being led by mining companies, such as Glencore and Anglo American, who are particularly exposed to global economic demand. Financial stocks, including Royal Bank of Scotland and Prudential, are also among the top risers. Joshua Mahoney of City firm IG predicts more big swings before the day is out... For all the posturing and emotive discussions that have taken place across homes, workplaces, TV studios and social media, the time has come for talk to turn into actions. Amid restrictions to broadcasters, there is an eerie feeling in the city, with a nervous energy evident as we await the fate of the nation. Whatever the result, volatility is likely to be the name of the game. The latest eurozone economic data is in, and it\u2019s not terribly good news. Markit\u2019s latest Purchasing Manager Index reports, which track activity across Europe, have come in weaker than expected. The composite PMI fell to 52.8, from 53.1 in May. That\u2019s a 17-month low, and closer to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Markit blamed \u201crising political uncertainty\u201d; another sign that Brexit fears have hit economic growth. It suggests Europe\u2019s economic recovery is weakening, as Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, explains: \u201cA renewed fall in new business was behind the decline, with respondents highlighting the difficulty of securing work amid a fragile demand environment. \u201cA flagging manufacturing sector was again the main source of weakness.\u201d Once again, Britain\u2019s nearest European neighbour was a laggard. The French PMI slid to 49.4 from 50.9 in May, meaning its private sector is probably contracting. After hitting its highest level of 2016 against the US dollar in early trading, the pound is now calmly bobbing around $1.477: Referendum day is always good for photos, to fill the time before the results come in. Our main EU referendum liveblog has a lot more: Sterling is also a little higher against the euro this morning, at \u20ac1.3050 (up from \u20ac1.3015 overnight). Although the pound has risen today, we should note that trading is pretty thin. And traders will be trading blind until after 10pm tonight, when the polls close and we get an on-the-day poll from YouGov. Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura, explains: \u201cIf polls after the vote closes suggests that \u201cLeave\u201d is in front, then we could see sterling drop. These are very challenging conditions.\u201d Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says traders seem to be influenced by the odds on offer at the bookmakers: \u201cAlthough most recent polls swayed toward the remain camp in the last couple of days, the lead is still very narrow, which doesn\u2019t explain the surge in pound. However, the markets are being completely reliant on the predictions from the bookies, which strongly expect \u201cremain\u201d to win the referendum.\u201d A little light music to guide you through the day.... European stock markets are mostly higher this morning, although there are no big moves. There\u2019s been a massive jump in the cost of insuring against sharp swings in the pound overnight. \u201cSterling overnight implied volatility\u201d - which basically measures the cost of hedging the pound \u2013 surged to levels not seen in many years (my data only goes back to 2008). It shows that investors are covering themselves against the pound rallying strongly, or plunging, over the next 24 hours, as referendum results come in. The pound has dipped back a little, as the rain pours down City trading floor windows. It\u2019s still up around 0.5% today, though, at $1.4763. And we\u2019re off ... trading has opened in London and the FTSE 100 is up just over 40 points, or 0.7%, at 6305 points. Tesco is highest FTSE 100 riser, up 2%, after better-than-expected sales growth of 0.3% for its core UK supermarkets chain. This is the first time in more than five years that Britain\u2019s biggest retailer has managed to produce two consecutive quarters of sales growth. It has also announced the sale of its Harris + Hoole coffee chain. City traders may actually struggle to get to their desks on time, given the torrential rain and flooding problems in London and the South East. Let\u2019s hope they have understanding bosses. My colleague Alex Hern may need one... Japan\u2019s stock market had a decent enough day, closing more than one percent higher in the last session before Britain\u2019s referendum. Britain\u2019s financial institutions have taken some pretty serious steps to protect themselves against volatile markets over the next few days. Our city editor Jill Treanor explains how investors will be setting up \u2018war rooms\u2019, ready to act as the referendum results start to come in.... Major banks are preparing for two days of unprecedented uncertainty by stuffing cash machines full of money, placing senior bankers on high alert in emergency war rooms around the City and switching off computer-driven \u201cblack box\u201d trading systems to avoid incurring huge losses in violent swings in shares, bonds and currency markets. With uncertainty about the precise moment the outcome of the EU referendumwill be known, dealing rooms are opening across the City on Thursday night and into Friday morning to allow trades to be executed for customers needing to respond to the results of the 382 polling areas as they start to be announced. Unlike a general election, no exit polls have been commissioned by broadcasters and the first results are expected at 12.30am on Friday and then throughout the night. It is possible the result may not be known by the scheduled opening of the stock market at 8am on Friday morning. Some banks have told investors that they will only conduct trading by taking verbal orders rather than through computers, while other banks are ready to override their algorithmic trading systems by closely monitoring them over night on Thursday.... Here\u2019s a handy chart from the FT, showing how the pound has picked up: Here\u2019s our latest news story about the referendum: Sterling has hit its highest level against the US dollar this year, as traders in Asia watched events in the UK. The pound hit $1.4844 against the US dollar for the first time in 2016, and is currently hovering around $1.48 in early London trading. The move came after several opinion polls were released last night. ComRes for the Daily Mail and ITV News put remain on 48%, leave on 42%. Excluding undecided voters, it found remain leading leave by 54% to 46%. A YouGov gave remain a two-point cushion, ahead of leave by 51% to 49%. However, a TNS poll released on Wednesday gave the advantage to leave, on 43%, with remain on 41% and 16% not decided or not voting at all. And many analysts say that the race is simply too close to call. Some forecasters have suggested the pound could hit 30-year lows in the event of a Brexit vote. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale explains how it could rock global markets: A decision to leave the EU is bad for global risk sentiment, good for the yen, and bad for sterling, the Euro and higher-beta currencies particularly central and Eastern European ones. On a \u2018Leave\u2019 decision, we expect the pound to fall to $1.30-$1.35 quickly and we look for an eventual fall to $1.20-$1.25 Good morning. There\u2019s only one important item on the agendas of investors across the world today. Britain is heading to the polls after a lengthy, bitterly fought campaign to decide if she stays in the European Union, or should leave. Traders in the City are preparing for a lengthy shift - perhaps staying late into the night, or returning to the office early tomorrow morning. Friday is likely to be one of the most dramatic and volatile trading sessions in many years, especially if the public choose to leave the EU. Analysts have predicted that the pound could slump by 15%, while shares would probably suffer big losses. Voting has just begun, with pollsters saying that the result is hard to call - especially as around 10% voters are still undecided. Turnout could be crucial, so it\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s currently tipping it down in London (summer, eh?), causing flooding problems and traffic disruption: Not great weather for a trip to the polling booth: Also coming up today: Supermarket chain Tesco is reporting results, plus we get new eurozone manufacturing data this morning and US weekly jobless figures this afternoon. But really, the markets will be nervously waiting for the results of today\u2019s vote, in the early hours of tomorrow morning.",

      "bodyText": "The pound has risen to a six-month high and the FTSE 100 has rallied strongly amid growing expectations among investors that Britain\u2019s EU referendum will result in a vote to stay in the bloc. An opinion poll published on Thursday morning \u2013 but conducted before voting began \u2013 gave a lead to the remain camp and helped boost the UK currency. Amid relief that weeks of uncertainty will soon be over, sterling rose 1.5% to $1.4931 against the dollar. That was the first move above $1.49 since December 2015. \u201cEven though we all know that polls can be rubbish, the markets seem quite happy that the remain camp has done enough to win,\u201d said Kathleen Brooks, research director at spread-betting firm City Index. Shares and the pound were higher from the open and got an extra fillip after the publication of an Ipsos Mori poll conducted for the Evening Standard newspaper showed a four-point lead for remain. The mood was echoed on stock markets, where the FTSE 100 index hit a two-month high. The index of leading shares was up 1.5% at 6357 in mid-morning trading, buoyed by mining shares as copper prices rose. There were also gains for other bourses around Europe with Germany and France\u2019s main share indices up almost 2%. The FTSE and pound have been buffeted by close opinion polls in recent weeks but in the past week market sentiment has swung to show growing confidence in a vote to remain in the EU. The FTSE has rallied every day this week and is so far up more than 5.5% from last Friday\u2019s close. With polls open from 7am to 10pm, there are strict rules for broadcasters that mean they cannot report details of campaigning until voting ends. The relative quiet following months of daily referendum news made for a tense atmosphere on City trading floors, said Joshua Mahony, analyst at IG, an online trading company. \u201cAmid restrictions to broadcasters, there is an eerie feeling in the City, with a nervous energy evident as we await the fate of the nation,\u201d said Mahony. \u201cWhatever the result, volatility is likely to be the name of the game and rumours of private exit polls from the hedge funds means that there is likely to be some substantial swings as speculative positions are placed into a relatively illiquid market.\u201d",
