      "bodyText": "When George Osborne was offering his post-match analysis in the bleary aftermath of the Tories\u2019 stunning victory on Friday morning, he singled out the Greek debt crisis as the first challenge he will face on returning to No 11. Both Osborne and Balls, his Labour opposite number, fought the general election campaign as though whoever won would be entirely the master of Britain\u2019s economic destiny. Yet chancellors are always to some extent the prisoners of outside events; and the new government, with its slim majority, could be buffeted by any of a series of threats in the global economy. Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, says: \u201cThere are huge global risks, and to a large extent any chancellor is going to be a passenger on that journey.\u201d Those big risks are: Grexit A full five years after Britain\u2019s last general election was played out against the background of an emergency bailout for Greece, the threat of a Greek departure from the European single currency \u2013 known as \u201cGrexit\u201d by investors \u2013 is once again casting a shadow over Europe\u2019s economies. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s radical-left Syriza government in Athens is battling to square the circle between an electorate that has been promised an end to austerity and Greece\u2019s international creditors, who are insisting on stringent economic reforms before they will release \u20ac7bn of much-needed bailout cash. The latest round of talks will take place on Monday, just a day before Greece has to find the cash to make another payment \u2013 of nearly \u20ac800m \u2013 to the International Monetary Fund. Neither side wants to see Greece plunge out of the euro. But with evidence mounting that Athens really is running out of cash \u2013 it recently had to temporarily delay millions of pension payments, and bills for hospital supplies are now going unpaid \u2013 there seems to be a growing risk of a default, which could well be followed by departure from the euro area. Eurozone politicians insist they are better prepared for the Greeks to leave than they would have been five years ago, with a European Central Bank rescue plan in place for member-country governments struggling to finance their debts; but in the short term, market chaos \u2013 always a significant risk for the UK, with its disproportionately large financial sector \u2013 would be highly likely. The collapse in confidence that would follow a Greek departure could also hit demand and depress growth right across the eurozone \u2013 a risk for British firms dependent on exports to this key market. US slowdown The latest GDP figures for the United States suggested that the economy slowed down sharply at the turn of the year, expanding at an annual rate of just 0.2% in the first quarter of 2015. Economists were quick to explain away the downturn as a temporary blip, caused by February\u2019s freezing weather and the shutdown of shale gas rigs as a result of global oil prices plunging (they have since recovered some ground). There have also been tentative signs in recent weeks that wage growth may finally be starting to pick up. But some US experts \u2013 including Harvard\u2019s Larry Summers, a former US treasury secretary \u2013 have warned that America will struggle to achieve a robust, sustainable recovery because the prevalence of insecure, low-wage jobs means that consumer demand will continue to be weak: a theory known as \u201csecular stagnation\u201d. The cliche that when America sneezes, the world catches a cold is not as true as it once was; but the US remains the world\u2019s largest economy, and a huge market for consumer goods. A slowdown across the Atlantic would be bad news for Britain\u2019s exporters. China crash Experts have long warned that China\u2019s vast economy may be facing a \u201chard landing\u201d, and some see the recent crash in global oil prices, as well as in other commodities, including iron ore, as partly a reflection of weakening Chinese demand. \u201cI\u2019m more worried than I\u2019ve ever been about China,\u201d says Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting. With property prices falling sharply, and exports collapsing, he says, \u201cthe problems are multiplying, and the risks of a policy mistake are growing\u201d. The coalition has made forging strong economic links with China a priority, even incurring the wrath of Washington by signing up to Beijing\u2019s plans for a new Asian infrastructure investment bank. Despite Osborne\u2019s \u2013 and Vince Cable\u2019s \u2013 best efforts in the last parliament, China is still not a major market for British businesses: but if the authorities in Beijing decided on a drastic devaluation of the yuan, for example, exporters around the world would be hit \u2014 and potentially spark market chaos. Commodity prices would also be likely to plunge if Chinese growth continued to weaken. \u201cIf China hits a pothole, we\u2019re all going to be paying a huge price,\u201d says Jones. The bond bubble bursts Central banks around the world \u2013 most recently in the eurozone \u2013 have bought billions of dollars of bonds since the crisis, in an effort to drive down interest rates, which tend to move in the opposite direction to bond prices, and kickstart growth. In Europe, an extraordinary \u20ac2 trillion of government bonds from \u201csafe haven\u201d countries, such as Germany, even have a negative yield \u2013 meaning, in effect, that investors are paying governments for the privilege of lending to them. \u201cEuropean interest rates are very, very odd,\u201d says Simon Derrick of investment firm BNY Mellon. \u201cIt\u2019s almost Through the Looking Glass.\u201d City investors may have been watching the general election on Thursday, but they also kept half an eye on the drama unfolding on eurozone bond markets. German bond yields shot up, raising fears that a day of reckoning for investors had come; but they plunged later in the day. Analysts observed that the rollercoaster trading was a mere foretaste of what could follow when the bubble does burst. No one knows what the trigger will be \u2013 perhaps the US Federal Reserve\u2019s first interest-rate rise since the crisis, which could come later this year \u2013 but at some point the wall of money that has poured into bonds is likely to be reversed, potentially sending borrowing costs, and the euro, lurching higher. Jones points out that a US rate rise, even if carefully signalled in advance, could have knock-on effects in some emerging countries that have been borrowing at low interest rates in dollars since the crisis. \u201cThe emerging markets could experience some financing difficulties,\u201d he says, singling out Brazil, Mexico, Turkey and South Africa as countries at risk. \u201cNobody ever knows what bursts a bubble,\u201d says Derrick. The potential impact for the UK would be hard to predict, but banks\u2019 balance sheets could be hit hard, and market turmoil would surely follow. Oil prices jump The sharp decline in the global oil price, from $100-plus a barrel last autumn to just $50, came as an exquisitely timed fillip for the Conservatives. Inflation dropped like a stone, hitting zero in March and finally reversing the extended decline in living standards that had been the hallmark of the UK\u2019s recovery from recession. Oil prices \u2013 over which no chancellor has any control \u2013 have already started to bounce back, and were close to $70 last Wednesday, before falling back slightly at the end of the week. Few analysts are predicting a rapid return to $100 \u2013 barring a conflagration in the Middle East \u2013 but plunging inflation has delayed monetary policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic from getting started on \u201cnormalising\u201d interest rates \u2013 that is, raising them. A gradual rise in the oil price would be manageable; a sharp jump would increase the risk of turbulence ahead. Geopolitical threats With hostilities in Ukraine rumbling on and the battle against Islamic State far from over, there is always the risk that one of the world\u2019s simmering conflicts will burst into life. As well as creating diplomatic and political headaches for the new Tory government, geopolitical events could wreak havoc on the global economy. Oil prices would surge if conflict intensified in the Middle East, for example \u2013 with painful consequences for western consumers. \u201cThe world is still quite a dangerous place, whoever is going to be in No 11,\u201d says Jones.",

      "bodyText": "The general election may be over but campaigning is still under way for a set of polls at the end of this week. More than two million members of the Co-operative Group are eligible to vote at Saturday\u2019s annual general meeting, which is intended to overhaul the group\u2019s boardroom and could determine whether the Labour-aligned Co-operative party goes on receiving up to \u00a31m a year from the supermarkets and funeral homes business. The AGM is breaking new ground. A new one-member-one-vote system is replacing a practice under which 100 or so representatives cast votes on behalf of the seven million members and independent societies which own the group. In theory up to 2.7 million members could attend the AGM in cavernous Exchange Hall at Manchester Central, a grand Victorian railway station converted into a modern conference centre. In practice, far fewer will turn up to the meeting, which will be overseen by new chairman Allan Leighton, the first to be appointed from outside the Co-operative movement. Last year\u2019s AGM was controversial, although members did vote through reforms proposed by Paul Myners in the wake of the scandal that took the Co-op Bank to the brink of collapse and saw the group make a record loss. As well as the one-member-one-vote system, Myners set out a plan for a 100-strong members\u2019 council to replace regional boards, and a new boardroom structure. A number of contentious issues are already being fought over, and the board may need to make some concessions to avoid a full-blown revolt. Some of the issues include: Member-nominated directors The direct representation of members on the board has been controversial. Myners did not intend to include any seats for Co-op members, but in a compromise a year ago the group agreed to three member-nominated directors. Even so, the process has provoked consternation among long-time activists: there will be no elections for these three seats, because only three candidates were put forward from a shortlist of six. The result of the election is scheduled to be announced at the AGM, although the members\u2019 council is arguing that the three other names from the shortlist should be included. There is also believed to be a legal opinion that the process needs to rethought. But the group says: \u201cThe member-nominated director process has been executed in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations and there are no grounds for a legal challenge.\u201d Donations to political parties The board has broken with tradition by not recommending that its members back a resolution to make up to \u00a31m of donations to the Co-op party (which now has 24 members sitting alongside Labour in the Commons, compared with 31 before the election \u2013 Ed Balls was the highest-profile casualty). Instead it is asking whether support should be given to political parties, whether the Co-op should engage with political parties, and whether to broaden political donations. The members\u2019 council has asked for this motion to be withdrawn and points out that the group technically does not make donations to the Co-op party but pays a subscription to it. It has tabled its own motion, which includes continuing the party subscription. Karin Christiansen, general secretary of the Co-op party, urged members to keep their political voice: \u201cThe Conservative party has returned to government with enormous financial support from business and wealthy individuals. Now, more than ever, Britain needs the Co-operative party speaking up for a powerful co-operative alternative that puts people at the heart of business and for an economy where the ownership and profits are more widely shared.\u201d Remuneration report Ever since the \u00a36.6m payday for departed boss Euan Sutherland was leaked to the Observer in March 2014, pay has been high on the Co-op agenda. Sutherland walked out 48 hours later, but the latest annual report shows he received \u00a31.8m after his departure and lists a string of other payments, including \u00a31.5m to former HR director Rebecca Skitt. These payments \u2013 and \u00a32.5m for Richard Pennycook, who replaced Sutherland at the helm \u2013 will all be voted on. Pennycook told the Times yesterday: \u201cMy package is bang in the middle of the median for an organisation of this size. And I think it\u2019s not unreasonable for the team here to say that, over the last two years, we\u2019ve saved the Co-op.\u201d Fairtrade The group\u2019s strategic objective states: \u201cIf a Co-operative product can be Fairtrade, it will be Fairtrade.\u201d But a motion urging the board to reaffirm this commitment contains caveats about the group\u2019s financial position and its shift to convenience shops.",

His plans will be voted on this weekend.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Myners at last year\u2019s Co-op AGM in Manchester. His plans will be voted on this weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Nicholson/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The direct representation of members on the board has been controversial. Myners did not intend to include any seats for Co-op members, but in a compromise a year ago the group agreed to three member-nominated directors. Even so, the process has provoked consternation among long-time activists: there will be no elections for these three seats, because only three candidates were put forward from a shortlist of six.</p> <p>The result of the election is scheduled to be announced at the AGM, although the members\u2019 council is arguing that the three other names from the shortlist should be included.</p> <p>There is also believed to be a legal opinion that the process needs to rethought. But the group says: \u201cThe member-nominated director process has been executed in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations and there are no grounds for a legal challenge.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Donations to political parties</strong><br></h2> <p>The board has broken with tradition by not recommending that its members back a resolution to make up to \u00a31m of donations to the Co-op party (which now has 24 members sitting alongside Labour in the Commons, compared with 31 before the election \u2013 Ed Balls was the highest-profile casualty). Instead it is asking whether support should be given to political parties, whether the Co-op should engage with political parties, and whether to broaden political donations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9099f87fa82caaff936348f3d745198e2b9059e9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/8/1431103672315/f8703d1d-da56-49e4-9805-39cec6948341-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ed Balls, the highest-profile Co-operative and Labour party member to lose a seat.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Balls, the highest-profile Co-operative and Labour party member to lose a seat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The members\u2019 council has asked for this motion to be withdrawn and points out that the group technically does not make donations to the Co-op party but pays a subscription to it. It has tabled its own motion, which includes continuing the party subscription.</p> <p>Karin Christiansen, general secretary of the Co-op party, urged members to keep their political voice: \u201cThe Conservative party has returned to government with enormous financial support from business and wealthy individuals. Now, more than ever, Britain needs the Co-operative party speaking up for a powerful co-operative alternative that puts people at the heart of business and for an economy where the ownership and profits are more widely shared.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Remuneration report</strong></h2> <p>Ever since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/08/new-co-op-storm-pay-deals\">\u00a36.6m payday for departed boss Euan Sutherland</a> was leaked to the <em>Observer</em> in March 2014, pay has been high on the Co-op agenda. Sutherland walked out 48 hours later, but the latest annual report shows he received \u00a31.8m after his departure and lists a string of other payments, including \u00a31.5m to former HR director Rebecca Skitt. These payments \u2013 and \u00a32.5m for Richard Pennycook, who replaced Sutherland at the helm \u2013 will all be voted on. Pennycook told the <em>Times</em> yesterday: \u201cMy package is bang in the middle of the median for an organisation of this size. And I think it\u2019s not unreasonable for the team here to say that, over the last two years, we\u2019ve saved the Co-op.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Fairtrade</strong></h2> <p>The group\u2019s strategic objective states: \u201cIf a Co-operative product can be Fairtrade, it will be Fairtrade.\u201d But a motion urging the board to reaffirm this commitment contains caveats about the group\u2019s financial position and its shift to convenience shops.</p>",
