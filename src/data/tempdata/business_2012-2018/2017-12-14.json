      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has revealed falling sales at its core UK stores and a dive in profits partly caused by the slump in the value of the pound. Sales at the Sports Direct, USC and Heatons chains fell 1% to \u00a31.14bn in the six months to 29 October, as the company said it had cut online promotions and closed stores as part of its attempts to improve the look and feel of its stores. Overall revenues for the group, which owns stores in the US and Europe as well as the Flannels fashion chain, rose 4.7%, partly thanks to acquisitions and overseas growth. But profits dived 67.3% to \u00a345.8m in the half year as margins came under pressure from the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar, in which Sports Direct buys much of its stock. Tony Shiret, an analyst at Whitman Howard, said in a note that changes to Sports Direct\u2019s structure made it difficult to assess performance but he believed sales at the core chain\u2019s established stores and website were both down. Mike Ashley, chief executive and the majority shareholder of Sports Direct, said underlying profit before tax remained healthy and the company was investing for the long-term. \u201cOur high street elevation strategy is currently delivering spectacular trading performance within our flagship stores. We intend to open between 10 and 20 new flagship stores next year,\u201d he said. Shares in Sports Direct closed down just over 2% as analysts were surprised by a big rise in net debt to \u00a3471m, from \u00a3182m a year before, and raised concerns about lack of transparency, corporate governance and investments in potentially distracting \u201cstrategic stakes\u201d in companies such as Debenhams. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cSports Direct\u2019s corporate governance practices continue to attract headlines for all the wrong reasons, with independent shareholders rejecting an \u00a311m payment to Mike Ashley\u2019s brother on Wednesday. \u201cUnfortunately the lack of transparency also stretches to the \u2018Selfridges of Sport\u2019 initiative. Mike Ashley has described trading at the new format stores as \u2018spectacular\u2019, but it\u2019s difficult to see evidence of that in the numbers. Improved profits are being driven by cost cuts rather than sales growth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Disney has signalled it will not attempt to buy 100% of Britain\u2019s biggest pay-TV broadcaster if the media regulator quashes Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn bid for full control of Sky. The owner of Walt Disney Studios is duty bound to accept the consequences of the competition regulator\u2019s investigation into 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid for the 61% of Sky it does not already own. If the Competition and Markets Authority clears the bid and Disney is in turn allowed to complete the $66bn (\u00a349bn) Fox deal announced on Thursday, then Sky will come under the full ownership of the theme parks-to-films conglomerate. However, Disney indicated on Thursday it would settle for a 39% stake in Sky if Fox\u2019s full takeover attempt is rejected by the CMA when it makes its preliminary decision in mid-January. The US media group has told the UK Takeover Panel, the City watchdog for corporate deals, that it does not wish to be forced to pursue a full takeover of Sky. \u201cDisney doesn\u2019t want a gun pointed at its head with someone ready to pull the trigger and force them to bid,\u201d said Alex de Groote, an analyst at stockbroker Cenkos. \u201cThey want flexibility in negotiations.\u201d De Groote said Disney would probably have to pay more than the original \u00a310.75 per share bid made by Murdoch in 2016 if it is required to bid again. He added that the \u201cgeneral mood\u201d among independent shareholders at Sky is that they should be paid more for the business if the much bigger Disney is buying it. On Thursday, Rupert Murdoch said that if the CMA blocked the Sky deal, Disney would have a decision to make. \u201cIf anything goes wrong [with the deal] the existing shares in Sky will still go to Disney, it will be up to them what to do,\u201d Rupert Murdoch said in a call with analysts on Thursday. Disney has written to the takeover panel to say that it does not believe it should be obliged to mount a new bid of its own if Sky\u2019s offer fails. Under rule 9.1 of the takeover code, companies are normally forced to make an offer if they buy a stake of 30% or more. There is also the complicating factor that Disney\u2019s bid for 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets could have valued the Sky stake at more than Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 10.75p a share offer made in December last year. Another factor is the upcoming Premier League TV rights auction. City consensus is that the next three-year deal may cost Sky up to 45% more, a further \u00a31.8bn stretch on its balance sheet. However, with arch-rival BT indicating it probably won\u2019t spark a bidding war the inflation level may be much lower \u2013 depending on whether the likes of Amazon bid or not. If BT fails to bid aggressively and would-be newcomers such as Amazon do not come through, it would mean that analysts would have to re-model a much more positive outlook for Sky. In turn, this would push up the valuation of the pay-TV broadcaster and increase the clamour among independent shareholders for more than \u00a310.75p per share. Sky, which has more than 12 million subscribers in the UK and Ireland, closed at \u00a39.90p per share on Thursday. Selling the Sky stake will reduce the political and regulatory scrutiny of a business that has been the subject of several takeover-related inquiries over the years. Tom Watson, the shadow media secretary, said the CMA must continue its investigation. \u201cWe wait to see what impact this proposed merger will have on the attempt by 21st Century Fox to buy Sky, but the CMA needs to continue its investigation and ensure that the proposed deal does not threaten media plurality or broadcasting standards,\u201d he said. Sky has grown into a multibillion-pound business under Rupert Murdoch\u2019s control, gaining millions of subscribers and transforming the British broadcasting landscape, not least in converting top-flight football into a global entertainment product. However, the rise of Netflix and Amazon Prime poses a serious threat to its model. Netflix has forced Sky to launch its Sky Now product, which allows viewers to buy individual films, programmes and access to football matches without a monthly subscription. Disney will be expected to bolster Sky with its considerable heft in TV and film production, although Sky is a serious producer in its own right as the maker of shows including Riviera and Fortitude. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "Black Friday lifts UK retail sales despite income squeeze", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Black Friday discounts encouraged British consumers to increase their spending on the high street and online in November, despite the most protracted squeeze on household income in memory. Officials at the Office for National Statistics said the American-inspired promotional event had helped drive a 1.1% increase in the number of goods bought last month compared with October, with sales of electrical household appliances making the biggest contribution to growth. City economists had forecast growth of 0.4%. The figures suggest consumers are willing to keep spending despite the sharpest rise in inflation for almost six years, driven by the higher cost of importing goods to the UK as a consequence of the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote. Households are also coming under pressure from weak wage growth, despite record levels of unemployment in the UK and falling net migration, which should be acting to drive up the bargaining power of British workers to demand higher wages as firms face labour shortages. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, average annual pay when taking account of inflation may not return to its pre-financial crisis peak until at least 2025. Economists have previously that warned stronger spending growth may be coming at the expense of household savings as a result of rising prices and weaker earnings growth. Households also run the risk of borrowing more to keep up with the rise in the cost of living. Still, the sales figures are encouraging for the health of the economy, providing a shot in the arm for retailers hit by higher inflation driving up their costs and potentially discouraging shoppers. Economists said the sales increase would help boost GDP growth in the final three months of the year. The Bank of England is likely to take comfort from the unexpected stronger growth in consumption, after raising interest rates for the first time in a decade last month to curb rising inflation. The Bank argued the growth potential of the economy before prices began to spiral had fallen since the Brexit vote. Threadneedle Street left interest rates on hold on Thursday after the first meeting of its monetary policy committee since November\u2019s rate hike \u2013 in line with expectations from City economists. However, the Bank said it still saw the need for \u201cfurther modest increases\u201d over the next few years to get inflation down to its target rate of 2%. The consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation rose to 3.1% in November, the highest level in almost six years, forcing Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to explain why inflation was more than one percentage point higher than the official target. Non-food sales rose 1.5% in November from the previous month, while household goods sales \u2013 which includes electrical appliances in hot demand over Black Friday \u2013 were up 2.9%. There was a 1.4% rise in sales of textiles, clothing and footwear, while food sales increased by 0.6%. The monthly sales figures also show the increasing importance of online shopping in the UK, with an increase in average weekly spending of 10.2% compared with a year ago. Internet sales account for 17% of the retail sector, excluding automotive fuel, compared with 16.1% a year ago. There are, however, warnings that the Black Friday lift could be short-lived because the sales encourage consumers to finish their Christmas shopping earlier in the year, which could lead to weaker sales in the traditional boom month of December. The British Retail Consortium warned there was a general downward trend for the growth in the quantity of goods sold \u2013 compared with their monetary value \u2013 in 2017, cautioning that Christmas and the new year were likely to be a testing time for the high street. Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cBlack Friday discounting has generally led consumers to do their Christmas shopping earlier than usual, rather than making many additional purchases. So some weakening in December seems likely.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "ECB hikes growth forecasts but admits losses on Steinhoff bonds - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. The European Central Bank has hiked its growth forecasts, but admitted that inflation still won\u2019t be on target by 2020. In its final meeting of 2017, the eurozone\u2019s central bank voted to leave interest rates on hold - and repeated its commitment to running an asset-purchase stimulus programme until at least next September. Playing his cards close to his chest, president Mario Draghi batted away questions on whether the stimulus programme would continue at a slower rate beyond September 2018, or come to an abrupt halt. Draghi also admitted that the ECB has incurred losses on corporate bonds issued by troubled retailer Steinhoff. Those bonds have plunged in value since the company announced accounting problems, and the departure of its CEO. Reuters has a good take: \u201cRunning such big corporate programmes it is not unusual that losses may be happening,\u201d he told a news conference after the bank left benchmark interest rates and the terms of the asset purchase scheme unchanged. The ECB\u2019s rules only allow it to own debt as part of its asset-buying programme, which means it might have to sell its Steinhoff holding if the bonds were converted to equity. Draghi said the ECB had stopped buying the bonds as soon as the firm\u2019s troubles emerged, and its losses from the purchases had been \u201cby and large exaggerated by a factor of 10.\u201d He said policymakers were discussing the issue but \u201cI cannot elaborate a lot about what we are going to do next.\u201d That\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The press conference is over -- several minutes early. As suspected at the start, Draghi is ready for Christmas. Back on the ECB\u2019s stimulus programme.... Draghi says the ECB hasn\u2019t discussed whether it should bring its bond-buying programme to an abrupt stop next September, or simply continue at a slower rate. Q: What the risks to your inflation forecasts - to the downside, or the upside? The risk of deflation has disappeared, Draghi replies, but he won\u2019t go much further than that. Q: Do you think Greece will need a fourth bailout when its existing programme expires? That\u2019s an issue for the Greek government, Draghi replies. Draghi is also asked about the legal proceedings against Greece\u2019s former chief statistician earlier. The independence of statistical bodies and their people is essential, Draghi declares passionately, as their data is vital for designing monetary policy It is wrong to undermine this credibility, Draghi insists, adding that one must also respect the independence of the judiciary. Q: Germany hasn\u2019t had a government for three months, and it might take several more months. Will this impact the push for banking union? Draghi replies that the ECB is \u2018entirely in the hands of the citizens of Europe\u2019. Thanks to democracy, it is the people who will decide how and when the eurozone is strengthened. Q: Are you worried about bubbles in the financial markets, and how your exit from your stimulus programme could effect them? We always discuss financial stability issues, Draghi replies firmly. The ECB does see some localised causes for concern, but no \u2018systemically significant\u2019 threats. Crucially, leverage doesn\u2019t seem to be going up - a key issue when examining whether asset valuations have hit dangerous levels, he adds. Q: Mr Draghi, do you expect to raise interest rates before your term ends in autumn 2019? Draghi says he can\u2019t say what he expects...but any rate rise would be good news as it would mean that inflation was on a \u2018self-sustained\u2019 recovery. On the Steinhoff bond issue, Mario Draghi also insisted that the ECB\u2019s losses were being exaggerated significantly. Q: Some European companies think they are disadvantaged by the new US tax reforms - do you have any concerns? Draghi says the ECB hasn\u2019t looked at this issue yet, but it will give it some consideration. Draghi is then asked whether the ECB expects to suffer significant losses over its holdings in bonds issued by Steinhoff, the retail giant that is embroiled in a deepening financial scandal. Draghi confirms that \u201cthe losses are there\u201d within the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme, although they\u2019ve not been realised yet. So who will pay for these losses? These bonds are only a small fraction of the profit we achieved last year, Draghi replies, suggesting the ECB can absorb the hit. But he also points out that the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme is one of its policy tools to achieve its mandate. The goal is not to achieve profits or avoid losses. Draghi also argues that the ECB should be applauded for being so open about which bonds it has bought under its stimulus programme. Other central banks didn\u2019t disclose what they held, so journalists don\u2019t know what losses they made. Q: Some of your colleagues have said they expect the asset-purchase programme to end in September. Do you? Draghi rebuts this notion, saying that \u201cvast majority of the governing council\u201d want to retain the open-ended nature of the asset-purchase programme. Q: Are you worried about negative effects on the eurozone economy from last night\u2019s increase in US interest rates, which further widens the gap between American and European borrowing costs? The different decisions taken here and on the other side of the ocean reflect the different stages that our respective economies have reached, says Draghi firmly. Europe is actually growing faster than the US right now, but on issues such as wage growth it is lagging behind. And no, the ECB doesn\u2019t see any negative signs yet. Q: Are you confident that you will achieve your inflation targets? Draghi says he\u2019s more confident than a few months ago, thanks to the \u201ccontinuing improvement\u201d in the labour market. Q: Are you reviewing the asset-purchase programme each month, or are its parameters fixed in stone until September? And has there been any discussion on the open-ended design of the APP? That\u2019s only one question, Draghi smiles. And the answer is that the current parameters were agreed at our last meeting (so it\u2019s too early to start changing them). Q: Did you consider dropping the link between the asset purchase scheme and inflation in your guidance? No, say Draghi. Q: You\u2019re forecasting 1.7% inflation in 2020 - are you sticking to your previous view that this doesn\u2019t count as \u201cclose to, but below, 2%\u201d? Draghi tried to bat this away, saying the important issue is how close we are to a sustained return of inflation to our target levels. Onto questions.... Q: When will we know when the ECB will decide how its asset purchase scheme will operate beyond September? [currently, it is due to run at \u20ac30bn/month until at least September] Draghi reads out his opening statement again (in which the ECB pledges to continue or even boost the programme if needed). There is no change to our existing stance, he says. Q: Are you worried that you are short of ammunication to cope with an economic downturn? We haven\u2019t discussed that, says Draghi. Frankly, it seems a remote possibility, even less than six months or a year ago. Draghi ends his statement by urging eurozone governments to \u201csubstantially\u201d step up their structural reforms. We also have new inflation forecasts...and the ECB has raised its forecast for 2018, from 1.2% to 1.4%. But it still doesn\u2019t see consumer price inflation hitting its target of just below 2% by 2020. That explains why it is promising to keep interest rates rates low for some time. The ECB has \u201csubstantially\u201d upgraded its growth forecasts compared to September\u2019s forecasts, says Mario Draghi. The new forecasts are: 2.4% growth in 2017 [up from 2.2%, I think] 2.3% growth in 2018 [up from 1.8%] 1.9% growth in 2019 [up from 1.7%] 1.7% growth in 2020 Draghi says the eurozone still needs \u201cfavourable\u201d financing conditions, even though the growth outlook has improved significantly recently. He says inflation will converge with the ECB\u2019s target in time, though underlying inflation pressures have not yet shown a convincing upturn. Mario Draghi sets the tone for today\u2019s press conference by arriving a couple of minutes late. Looking cheerful, the European Central Bank president wishes the assembled journalists a \u201cMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year\u201d. Clearly he\u2019s already thinking about 2018.... He\u2019s now reading out the statement released earlier, confirming that the ECB has left interest rates on hold today, and will leave them at current levels for an \u201cextended period of time\u201d. Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference is about to start in Frankfurt. It\u2019s also being streamed live here: Watch out for paper aeroplanes flying across the ECB press conference room when Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference begins..... Over in Frankfurt, the ECB has voted to leave interest rates across the eurozone at their current record lows. That means the headline cost of borrowing remains at zero, while banks will be charged a negative interest rate for leaving deposits with the central bank. The ECB also confirmed that it plans to reduce its monthly bond-buying programme from \u20ac60bn to \u20ac30bn next month (a decision announce in late October). But it is also promising to increase the programme again if the economy weakens: Here\u2019s the statement (which doesn\u2019t include any significant changes) At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that from January 2018 it intends to continue to make net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), at a monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion, until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the APP in terms of size and/or duration. The Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision hasn\u2019t caused many ructions in the City. Traders hoping for some pre-Christmas crackers from the BoE are disappointed; today\u2019s minutes are pretty sober, with policymakers predicting that future interest rate rises will be gradual and limited. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: After the excitement of last month\u2019s interest rate rise it was back to business as usual for the Bank of England today, with a fully-expected unanimous no change decision. The minutes were also fairly dull, with little having changed in the Committee\u2019s view since the November Inflation Report. Brexit is highlighted as the most significant influence on the economic outlook, with the minutes noting the trade-off between setting interest rates to control inflation and setting them to provide support to jobs and growth. As this Brexit-related uncertainty is almost certainly here to stay, I expect the Bank to proceed cautiously from here. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank reckons that the BoE will sit on its hands for another six months. Following the first rate hike in a decade just last month, we did not expect another policy change today at the BoE\u2019s December Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. Instead, we were mainly looking for clues in the forward guidance for when the BoE would hike next. Unfortunately, the MPC did not offer much. By voting unanimously in favour of keeping rates on hold today while stating in its guidance that, \u2018further modest increases in Bank Rate would be warranted over the next few years, in order to return inflation sustainably to the target\u2019, the MPC signalled that while it plans to tighten monetary policy further, it is not yet ready to begin the process of preparing markets for the next hike just yet. This sits well with our call that the next hike will not come until the second quarter of 2018, some six months away. Expect stronger guidance on the path of rate hikes at the February 2018 Inflation Report when the BoE will also updates its economic forecasts. In addition, the committee stated that, with respect to last month\u2019s 25bps rate hike, that \u2018it was too early to gauge fully the effect that this tightening was having on the economy\u2019 - expect a detailed analysis in the February report. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Asset Management, adds: \u201cIt came as no surprise that the Monetary Policy Committee left interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. At a 9 \u2013 0 vote, the committee has been more aligned than it has been for some time. The economy remains fragile and even though progress is being made in the Brexit negotiations the eventual outcome is still very uncertain; businesses and individuals will remain wary and conscious of what they are spending. Disney\u2019s Bob Iger has been talking about the Fox deal: The FT\u2019s Lionel Barber tweets: Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Keane hopes that one of Fox\u2019s most successful cartoons will keep running: Speaking of the Simpsons.... Breaking news: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has agreed to sell its entertainment assets to Disney in a $66bn (\u00a349bn) deal that transforms his media empire by offloading a 39% stake in Sky. My colleague Mark Sweney explains: The takeover involves the 86-year-old tycoon and his family taking a 4.25% stake in Disney with assets including the 20th Century Fox film studio, the controlling stake in Britain\u2019s biggest pay-TV broadcaster and a number of cable channels going in the other direction. Murdoch will retain control of the profitable, and controversial, Fox News channel. The deal will not, for now, impact the proposed takeover by 21st Century Fox of the 61% of Sky it does not own. The Competition and Markets Authority will continue to investigate the deal as a Murdoch-brokered takeover, pending Fox\u2019s Sky stake officially changing hands. Here\u2019s a photo of Disney\u2019s chairman Bob Iger and Rupert Murdoch celebrating sealing the deal. On Brexit, the Bank of England says there has been \u201cprogress\u201d in negotiations between the UK and Brussels. This has helped to push the pound up in recent weeks, the monetary policy committee believe. In today\u2019s minutes, they say: Developments regarding the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union \u2013 and in particular the reaction of households, businesses and asset prices to them \u2013 remain the most significant influence on, and source of uncertainty about, the economic outlook. The Committee noted the progress in the Article 50 negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The Bank of England has flagged up that Britain\u2019s inflation rate hit 3.1% last month - meaning it has failed to meet its goal of keeping the CPI close to 2%. The BoE pins the blame on the slump in sterling after the EU referendum in June 2016, saying: It remains the case that inflation has been pushed above the target by the boost to import prices that resulted from the past depreciation of sterling. The MPC judges that inflation is likely to be close to its peak, and will decline towards the 2% target in the medium term. Governor Mark Carney will expand on this issue in an open letter to chancellor Philip Hammond, which will be published in February. The Bank of England says that recent UK macroeconomic data has been \u201cmixed\u201d, and it fears that growth may have slowed in the last quarter of 2017. It says: The recent news in the macroeconomic data has been mixed and relatively limited. Global growth has remained strong. Domestically, some activity indicators suggest GDP growth in Q4 might be slightly softer than in Q3. The measures announced in the Autumn Budget will lessen the drag on aggregate demand stemming from fiscal consolidation, relative to previous plans. The labour market remains tight, and surveys suggest this will continue. [Reminder: The UK economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of this year] The Bank of England is also maintaining its current quantitative easing stimulus programme, which has bought \u00a3435bn of government debt and \u00a310bn of corporate bonds. The interest rate decision is unanimous, with every member of the Monetary Policy Committee voting to leave borrowing costs unchanged. Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates at 0.5%. More to follow All eyes are turning to the Bank of England, as it prepares to release its interest rate decision at noon. With rates highly likely to remain on hold, traders will be speed-reading the minutes of today\u2019s meeting for hints about potential policy changes in 2018. As Bloomberg puts it: The Bank of England will fall into a central banking holding pattern on Thursday after November saw the first interest-rate hike in a decade. With no policy move expected by economists, the spotlight will be on any comment on the market pricing for two more rate increases over the next three years. Governor Mark Carney and most fellow policy makers haven\u2019t disputed that outlook, which would lift the benchmark to 1 percent from 0.5 percent. It really is a busy day for central bankers. Turkey\u2019s central bank has just raised borrowing costs by 50 basis points (0.5%), to an eye-watering 12.75%. And yet, the Turkish lira has dropped in value. Clearly traders had expected a chunkier rate rise to tackle Turkey\u2019s inflation problem (which hit 13% in November). Last month, the Bank of England was split over whether to raise interest rates. Seven policymakers voted to hike to 0.5%, but two - both deputy governors - wanted to leave rates on hold at just 0.25%. Having been outvoted, Sir Jon Cunliffe and Sir Dave Ramsden now need to decide whether to join the rest of the flock, or push for a rate cut! A general strike has paralysed Greece as anger grows over government attempts to crack down on the ability of unionists to press ahead with industrial action. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Anti-austerity protests nationwide will cap a general strike that has brought much of the country to a standstill. The 24-hour lockdown follows creditor-dictated reforms aimed at reversing what is widely seen as the hallowed right to call strike action. Unions representing workers in both the public and private sector are up in arms vowing to fight \u201cto the end\u201d to protect rights won, they say, with blood and sweat. \u201cIt is a right first won a hundred years ago and we are going to do everything we can to defend it,\u201d Grigoris Kalomoiris, chief policy maker at the union of public sector employees, ADEDY, told the Guardian. \u201cThe government will have to withdraw its promise to lenders,\u201d he said of the international bodies behind three successive bailouts of debt-stricken Greece. The measure is among an array of reforms Athens\u2019 leftist-led coalition has agreed to implement to expedite a third review that, if concluded, could see Greece exiting international supervision and returning to capital markets. Addressing protestors this morning, community party chief Dimitris Koutsoumbas said: \u201cthe government is continuing the misery, it is continuing the dirty work against the Greek people.\u201d The 24-hour walk-out has not only closed all state services but disrupted public transport and flights in and out of the country. Earlier this week, unionists angrily targeted Greece\u2019s pre-eminent capitalist symbol: the headquarters of the Hellenic Federation of Industrialists claiming the ground was being prepared for a new round of assaults against wages, contracts and collective labour agreements \u201cin order to increase the profits and privileges of industrial circles.\u201d In a carefully planned raid, workers affiliated with the communist labour force, Pame, threw red paint at the neo-classical building housing the federation in the heart of Athens before daubing its fa\u00e7ade with the slogan: \u201cget your hands off the right to strike\u201d and \u201c751 euro the minimum wage.\u201d The pound is up a little against the US dollar this morning, at $1.344, as traders await the Bank of England\u2019s decision at midday. Alexandra Russell-Oliver of currency firm Caxton says: Markets expect the BoE to keep interest rates on hold after November\u2019s hike and to maintain a cautious pace going forward. No additional hikes are expected before the latter part of 2018. This means traders will be watching today\u2019s statements for any guidance that might shift forward rate hike expectations; if such hints are provided, the pound may strengthen. Otherwise, the meeting may weigh on the pound with little set to renew sterling demand and given the risk of some traders\u2019 expectations being disappointed. She adds that Brexit developments could also shunt the pound today. Indeed, sterling just had a little wobble after rumours of an important development in parliament; it recovered after House of Commons speaker ruled that Brexit secretary David Davis was not in contempt of parliament over his handling of the government\u2019s impact statements: The 1.6% year-on-year jump in UK retail sales last month is encouraging, says Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC. But she warns that the cold snap could hurt shops: \u201cAfter a disappointing October, it\u2019s good to see retail sales picking up again in November. It was a month of two halves, with a slow start followed by sales ramping up in the final few weeks as retailers kicked off their Black Friday and Christmas promotional activity in earnest. \u201cGiven the continued resilience of consumer sentiment, we\u2019re optimistic that Christmas shopping sales in December will hold up. However, one immediate risk is the weather - snow and freezing conditions dissuaded many shoppers from hitting the high street over the past week, and also delayed the deliveries of some online orders. Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy firm Retail Economics, suggests that some people got their Christmas shopping done early (more than I\u2019ve managed, frankly): He says: \u201cThese figures confirm that online won the Black Friday battle. Online sales growth dwarfed that of in-store as shoppers took advantage of Black Friday discounts, particularly in electricals. \u201cHowever, some retailers will be concerned that the Black Friday boost has come at the expense of traditional Christmas trading. Many consumers are likely to have pulled forward their seasonal purchases to make their budgets stretch further this Christmas. However, several City economists say we should treat these retail sales figures cautiously. They suspect the data is being skewed by Black Friday bargain-hunting . Here\u2019s Philip Shaw of Investec: And Sam Tombs of Pantheon: James Smith of ING agrees: At 1.2% (excluding fuel), UK retail sales grew at the fastest monthly pace since April as Black Friday saw another surge in sales of household and electrical goods. That said, it\u2019s worth treating these numbers with some caution. Black Friday is a relatively new and ever-changing beast, which makes it a nightmare for statisticians to seasonally adjust. Breaking: UK retail sales were much stronger than expected last month, suggesting Black Friday was a success. Retail sales volumes in November were 1.6% higher than a year ago, up from a flat performance in October. Customers spend 4.7% more in the shops and online than in November 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics. On a monthly basis, sales volumes were 1.1% higher than in October, including a 2.9% jump at household goods stores as shoppers snapped up electrical items. City economists had predicted that takings would be up last month, but not this strongly. Rhian Murphy, ONS Senior Statistician says: \u201cUnderlying retail sales growth remained reasonably strong in the last few months. Household goods stores had a good November, with a number of businesses saying that Black Friday promotions boosted sales.\u201d The report also shows that inflation was rife: Total average store prices increased by 3.1% in November 2017 when compared with the same period last year, with price increases across all store types, in particular food stores. Economist are impressed by this month\u2019s eurozone PMI reports. Danske Bank\u2019s Aila Mihr says the eurozone is growing strongly. Here\u2019s Howard Archer of the EY Item Club: Dutch investor and blogger Jeroen Blokland says German factories are on a roll: Boom! Eurozone companies are growing at the fastest rate in almost seven years, according to data firm Markit. Factories are benefitting from strong order growth, with export orders growing at a near record pace. Firms also reported that they are taking on more staff, helping to tackle Europe\u2019s unemployment problems. This drove the Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index up to 58.0 this month, an 82-month high, signalling that business activity continues to strengthen. Any reading over 50 shows growth. France and Germany led the way, with both countries experiencing the strongest private sector growth since 2011 -- the early days of the eurozone debt crisis. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the eurozone is ending 2017 on a high. \u201cThe eurozone economy is picking up further momentum as the year comes to a close, ending its best quarter since the start of 2011. The PMI is signalling an impressive 0.8% GDP increase in the fourth quarter, with accelerating growth seen in both Germany and France, where fourth quarter growth rates of 1.0% and 0.7-0.8% are indicated respectively. \u201cFrance has been the big surprise this year, rapidly pulling out of its malaise to help shift the eurozone expansion into a higher gear. \u201cThe eurozone upturn is being led by a booming manufacturing sector, with a record PMI seen in December, but stronger domestic demand is also helping drive faster service sector growth. Back in Zurich, Switzerland\u2019s top central banker insists that the SNB should maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy. SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan says: \u201cOur expansionary policy remains appropriate in order to underpin the recovery and thereby ensure price stability, while taking due account of economic developments.\u201d Over in the City, shares in Sports Direct have slumped by 9% this morning. The retailer, which is ambitiously trying to become the \u201cSelfridges of sport\u201d, reported that pre-tax profits slumped by 67% in the first half of the financial year. Revenues at its UK stores fell by 1% - the company blamed \u201creduced online promotional activity and store closures as part of the continued elevation of the portfolio\u201d. Underlying profits actually jumped by 22%, and founder Mike Ashley insists that his upmarket push is paying off: \u201cOur high street elevation strategy is currently delivering spectacular trading performance within our flagship stores. We intend to open between 10 and 20 new flagship stores next year. Take note, FX traders. The SNB is also promising to \u201cremain active\u201d in the foreign exchange market to prevent the Swiss franc becoming too strong. It adds: Since the last monetary policy assessment, the Swiss franc has weakened further against the euro and, more recently, has also depreciated against the US dollar. The overvaluation has thus continued to decrease, yet the franc remains highly valued. Newsflash: The Swiss National Bank has left Switzerland\u2019s interest rates unchanged at their current record low of minus 0.75%. Those negative rates are meant to prevent the swiss franc strengthening too much against other currencies. Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi says Mario Draghi has three tasks today, and they all involve some nimble verbal footwork: China\u2019s central bank is also joining the party. The Beijing central bank has decided to raise borrowing costs, following America\u2019s rate hike last night. It looks like another attempt to combat reckless lending and defuse credit risks without destabilising the Chinese economy. The FT\u2019s Alice Woodhouse has the details: The People\u2019s Bank of China has raised the seven-day reverse repurchase rate to 2.5 per cent while that for the 28-day reverse repurchase rate was increased to 2.8 per cent. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. \u2018Tiz the season to be jolly interested in central bankers! Today the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank will vying for attention, as they deliver their final monetary policy decisions before Christmas. After the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates last night, investors will want to hear what Mark Carney, Mario Draghi and Thomas Jordan say about the economic situation. Having raised borrowing costs last month, the Bank of England is highly unlikely to hike again today. With employment growth tailing off, and real wages lagging inflation, the Bank will surely leave interest rates at 05% Instead, traders will scrutinise the minutes of this week\u2019s meeting for hints of action in 2018, and the BoE\u2019s views on Brexit. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: A holding tone is most likely from Mark Carney &amp; Co. The recent Brexit deal, six-year high level of inflation and the uptick in wages are unlikely to waver the BoE, who will be looking to analyse the impact of the first-rate hike in a decade, with no intention of further hikes until late next year, at the earliest. Over in Frankfurt, Mario Draghi should be able to look back on a good year when he holds his final governing council meeting, followed by a press conference. We could get more hints about how the ECB will handle its bond-buying stimulus programme next year (it\u2019s currently scheduled to run until September 2018). But the press pack may have to work hard to persuade Draghi to produce any festive treats, as Craig Erlam of OANDA explains: With the economic recovery gathering momentum, Draghi is likely to be pushed on this and may offer small clues on the next steps, for example the timing of the first rate hike and how the central bank will approach raising rates and reducing its balance sheet. I don\u2019t think we should expect too much though as Draghi detests being perceived to have committed to anything. Also coming up today... In the City, retail chain Sports Direct, online grocer Ocado, outsourcer Capita and business supplies firm Bunzl are all reporting results. On the economic front, the Office for National Statistics will publish UK retail sales figures for November, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s analysts expect \u201csome rebound in sales volumes\u201d, following a weak report in October. Data firm Markit will releases its estimate of how eurozone companies are faring this month. Plus, Rupert Murdoch is expected to announce a $60bn (\u00a345bn) deal to sell assets in 21stCentury Fox, including a 39% stake in Sky and a Hollywood studio, to rival Disney. My colleague Mark Sweney has the details: The deal, which will reportedly be announced before the New York stock exchange opens on Thursday, or around midday UK time, marks a turning point in an empire building career that started in the 1950s and is expected to lead to a split in the Murdoch family dynasty. Rupert\u2019s son James Murdoch, the Fox chief executive, will leave the company, either to join Disney in a senior role or set up his own venture, according to the Financial Times Here\u2019s the agenda 8.30am GMT: Swiss National Bank interest rate decision 9am GMT: Eurozone \u2018flash\u2019 PMI reports for December 9.30am GMT: UK retail sales for November 12pm GMT: Bank of England interest rate decision 12.45pm GMT: ECB interest rate decision 1.30pm GMT: Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference",

If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the APP in terms of size and/or duration.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ecb/status/941288118447230976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Press release: Monetary policy decisions <a href=\"https://t.co/aZrLuuyhWa\">https://t.co/aZrLuuyhWa</a></p>&mdash; European Central Bank (@ecb) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecb/status/941288118447230976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 14, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-12-14T12:56:47.636Z\">at 12.56pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a32700332ead406c9717005\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-14T12:50:09.956Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of England: What the experts say</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1909a09a964a5720b851b0c8649a929ffb9230c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1909a09a964a5720b851b0c8649a929ffb9230c6/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A statue is silhouetted against the Bank of England in the City of London this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A statue is silhouetted against the Bank of England in the City of London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/14/bank-of-england-ecb-meetings-interest-rates-retail-sales-business-live?page=with:block-5a32679524e47405c4d7457c#block-5a32679524e47405c4d7457c\">The Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision</a> hasn\u2019t caused many ructions in the City.</strong></p> <p>Traders hoping for some pre-Christmas crackers from the BoE are disappointed; today\u2019s minutes are pretty sober, with policymakers predicting that future interest rate rises will be gradual and limited.</p> <p><strong>Ben Brettell, </strong>senior economist at <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong>, says:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the excitement of last month\u2019s interest rate rise it was back to business as usual for the Bank of England today, with a fully-expected unanimous no change decision.</p> <p>The minutes were also fairly dull, with little having changed in the Committee\u2019s view since the November Inflation Report. Brexit is highlighted as the most significant influence on the economic outlook, with the minutes noting the trade-off between setting interest rates to control inflation and setting them to provide support to jobs and growth.</p> <p>As this Brexit-related uncertainty is almost certainly here to stay, I expect the Bank to proceed cautiously from here.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kallum Pickering</strong> of <strong>Berenberg Bank </strong>reckons that the BoE will sit on its hands for another six months.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the first rate hike in a decade just last month, we did not expect another policy change today at the BoE\u2019s December Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. Instead, we were mainly looking for clues in the forward guidance for when the BoE would hike next. Unfortunately, the MPC did not offer much. By voting unanimously in favour of keeping rates on hold today while stating in its guidance that, \u2018further modest increases in Bank Rate would be warranted over the next few years, in order to return inflation sustainably to the target\u2019, the MPC signalled that while it plans to tighten monetary policy further, it is not yet ready to begin the process of preparing markets for the next hike just yet. </p> <p>This sits well with our call that the next hike will not come until the second quarter of 2018, some six months away. Expect stronger guidance on the path of rate hikes at the February 2018 Inflation Report when the BoE will also updates its economic forecasts. In addition, the committee stated that, with respect to last month\u2019s 25bps rate hike, that \u2018it was too early to gauge fully the effect that this tightening was having on the economy\u2019 - expect a detailed analysis in the February report. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Neil Birrell, </strong>chief investment officer at <strong>Premier Asset Management, </strong>adds:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt came as no surprise that the Monetary Policy Committee left interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. At a 9 \u2013 0 vote, the committee has been more aligned than it has been for some time.</p> <p>The economy remains fragile and even though progress is being made in the Brexit negotiations the eventual outcome is still very uncertain; businesses and individuals will remain wary and conscious of what they are spending.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a32712c24e47405c4d74609\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-14T12:45:41.969Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Disney\u2019s Bob Iger has been talking about the Fox deal:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CallumIJones/status/941287245029494785\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Asked whether <a href=\"https://twitter.com/21CF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@21CF</a> CEO James Murdoch will be joining Disney, Bob Iger says: &quot;James and I will be talking over the next number of months.

      "bodyText": "Ocado has been forced to increase pay for its delivery drivers after a shortage of recruits hit sales at the online grocer. The company said it had put up pay by mid single digits in London and the south-east as it struggled to find new drivers to meet growing demand in these areas. Duncan Tatton-Brown, chief financial officer of Ocado, said there was currently a tight labour market, partly caused by the boom in online shopping, generally high employment levels in the south and possibly the fall in attractiveness of the UK to EU drivers following the Brexit vote and the plunge in the value of the pound. \u201cMore people are buying products as soon as they want online and there are more demand for delivery services and a tight labour market,\u201d he said. He said the company had resolved the matter by raising wages and changing the way it recruited and advertised for its drivers, all of whom are direct employees. Ocado employs about 12,000 people, half of them drivers. Ocado is not the only company finding it hard to recruit. According to the recruitment company Manpower, some firms are offering bonuses and paying premiums of up to 20% on their standard rates to attract workers. Lorry drivers can earn more than \u00a320 an hour as well as bonuses of \u00a3100 per shift. Retail revenues at the online grocer rose 11.6% to \u00a3374m in the 14 weeks to 3 December, its fourth quarter, down from 13.1% in the previous three months. Growth in average orders per week slowed to 11.1%, to 280,000, while the average order size edged up 0.3% to \u00a3106.11. Tatton-Brown, said without the driver shortage the sales increase would have been closer to 13%. Ocado\u2019s deliveries are also restricted by the capacity of its latest highly automated warehouse in Andover, Hampshire. The company said the facility was delivering 50% more orders a week than three months ago with its robots working longer and more being added to the system. Tatton-Brown said the facility was \u201cprogressing very nicely\u201d but he added: \u201cWe have not set a public deadline when we expect to get to full capacity but it is not unreasonable to expect it to take three years.\u201d Analysts described Ocado\u2019s sales growth as slower than hoped and suggested that the gradual ramp up at Andover would continue to prove a \u201cheadwind\u201d. But there was optimism about the company signing more deals with overseas partners after joining up with French supermarket business Groupe Casino last month. Under the deal Ocado will build a robotic warehouse for the French group\u2019s Monoprix brand which is due to start operating in 2019. The long-awaited deal reassured investors who view Ocado as a tech firm which can sell its inventions and expertise worldwide. Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado, said he remained confident in the company\u2019s ability to sign more overseas deals in the \u201cmedium term\u201d.",

Tatton-Brown said the facility was \u201cprogressing very nicely\u201d but he added: \u201cWe have not set a public deadline when we expect to get to full capacity but it is not unreasonable to expect it to take three years.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts described Ocado\u2019s sales growth as slower than hoped and suggested that the gradual ramp up at Andover would continue to prove a \u201cheadwind\u201d.</p> <p>But there was optimism about the company signing more deals with overseas partners after joining up with French supermarket business Groupe Casino last month. Under the deal Ocado will build a robotic warehouse for the French group\u2019s Monoprix brand which is due to start operating in 2019.</p> <p>The long-awaited deal reassured investors who view Ocado as a tech firm which can sell its inventions and expertise worldwide.</p> <p>Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado, said he remained confident in the company\u2019s ability to sign more overseas deals in the \u201cmedium term\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull is claiming credit for another surge in the number of Australians finding work, as economists label 2017 a \u201cstellar year\u201d for the labour market. New data shows another 61,600 jobs were created in November, lifting the number of new jobs this year to 383,300. It was the 14th consecutive month of employment gains, a streak not seen since 1994, prompting some economists to predict the economy may reach \u201cfull employment\u201d next year. \u201cAt the last election, you will all remember, we campaigned on jobs and growth,\u201d Turnbull said in Sydney on Thursday. \u201cWell, it was a slogan then but it is an outcome now. Our policies are restoring confidence to business and business is responding by investing, creating more jobs and hiring more workers.\u201d The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, released on Thursday, show 41,900 full-time jobs and 19,700 part-time jobs were created in November in seasonally adjusted terms. Employment rose in every state and territory, with the largest rises in Victoria (by 32,900 jobs) and New South Wales (by 28,500). The unemployment rate remained steady at 5.4% (a five-year low) due to a jump in the number of people actively joining the labour force to look for work. That saw the so-called participation rate rise by 0.3 percentage points, from 65.2% to 65.5% \u2013 a six-year high. If the participation rate had been steady, the unemployment rate would have declined to 5.1%. \u201cWhat these numbers mean is that anybody who was looking for a job or wants to get a better job or a different job has more opportunities to find one,\u201d Turnbull said. Katie Hickie, an economist from Capital Economics, said 80% of new jobs in 2017 had been full-time positions, helping to explain why average hours worked per employee is now growing at an annual pace of 0.8% \u2013 \u201cits fastest since June and well above the five-year average of -0.2%\u201d. \u201cIt has clearly been a stellar year for the labour market and this will raise the annual growth rate of household disposable income from the very weak 0.5% in the third quarter,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd while such elevated rates of jobs growth are unlikely to be sustained, most leading indicators suggest employment growth will remain decent in the coming months.\u201d The strength in full-time work also led to a further fall in people considered \u201cunderemployed\u201d \u2013 employed but seeking more hours of work. The underemployment rate declined slightly to 8.4% in August, accounting for just over 1 million workers, after hitting a record high of 8.9% in February. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief economist, Adam Carr, said it was clear the economy was gaining strength. \u201cResults like this give us confidence wage growth will pick up,\u201d he said in a statement. BIS Oxford Economics\u2019 head of Australian macroeconomics, Sarah Hunter, said employment growth would likely slow in 2018, with the present rate of more than 3% unsustainable in the long run. \u201cBut the continued strong performance \u2026 will provide some more relief to households and consumer spending,\u201d she said, adding that household consumption ought to bounce back strongly in the December quarter. The recent national accounts showed household consumption slipped to its slowest rate since the 2008 global financial crisis in the face of slow wages growth. Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird said the strength of the jobs market all but confirmed the next move by the Reserve Bank would be an increase in the cash rate. \u201cWe think wages growth will lift gradually but not sufficiently so to bring a rate rise into the fray until late 2018,\u201d Aird said. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will hand down his mid-year budget review on Monday, which is expected to show a smaller deficit than predicted in May, partly as a result of a revenue windfall from a strong labour market.
