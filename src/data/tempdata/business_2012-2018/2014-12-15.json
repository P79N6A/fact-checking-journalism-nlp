    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in the City closed at their lowest level of 2014 on Monday night as fears that the plunging oil price will prompt economic collapse in energy-dependent Russia led to a global stock market sell-off. A fresh slide in the cost of crude to a five-and-a-half-year low sent the rouble into freefall against the US dollar, sending tremors through financial markets in Asia, Europe and North America. Investors dumped shares as they weighed up the risk that a deepening economic crisis would destabilise Russia and make it more difficult for the west to deal with Vladimir Putin, adding to geopolitical tensions in eastern Europe and the Middle East. In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares fell for the sixth day in a row, with energy companies particularly hard hit by the drop in Brent crude to around $61 a barrel. The FTSE has lost 9% since the start of last week and closed on Monday night at 6717 points \u2013 after Monday\u2019s 118-point fall it is more than 500 points lower than its level at the start of the year. Although the near-halving of the cost of crude from $115 a barrel since the summer should eventually boost global growth by increasing consumer spending power and reducing business costs, investors are concerned that lower oil prices reflect softer demand from a weakening global economy. The slowdown in China has played an important factor in the decline in oil prices. Major European bourses lost 2% of their value on a day that also cost the rouble more than 10% of its value against the US dollar despite attempts by Russia\u2019s central bank to arrest the currency\u2019s decline. The authorities in Moscow followed last week\u2019s increase in interest rates by buying roubles on the foreign exchanges, but failed to prevent the biggest one-day decline in the currency since Russia\u2019s debt default in 1998. Neil Shearing, chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics, said there was now speculation that Russia would resort to capital controls to defend the rouble. Oil and gas account for 70% of Russia\u2019s exports and Moscow needs an oil price in the region of $100 a barrel to balance its budget. The central bank said that the economy would contract by 4.5% in 2015 if the oil price remains at its current level for the next 12 months. The global oil price was under renewed downward pressure after Opec stressed it had no immediate intention of curbing production. Some analysts believe that Saudi Arabia and the US are deliberately pushing oil prices lower in order to pressure Putin over Ukraine. Washington hinted on Monday that it was contemplating tougher sanctions against Russia for its support to separatists in eastern Ukraine. Neil Barnett, of the Centre for Policy Studies, said: \u201cThe bad news for Russia is that the outlook for oil prices appears weaker and weaker. This week the International Energy Agency cut its demand growth forecast. In combination with still-growing US production and Saudi determination to keep prices low, it means that prices next year are likely to fall yet further.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe pace of the fall has been breathtaking, with oil-related stocks bearing the worst of the pain. We are now closing in on a technical correction [10% fall] after just six abysmal trading sessions. To give some perspective, we already witnessed a 10% fall in the UK market in September and October of this year, but this took place over six weeks, not six days. The positive to take away is that a lower oil price should put more money into the pockets of UK consumers and many UK businesses, but this will take some time to feed through into expenditure and profits. In the meantime, investors would as usual be well-advised to keep focused on the long term\u2013 equity investing is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It was a balmy California evening as Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine strolled along the Los Angeles beachfront. The rap music producer was keen to cash in on his Dr Dre brand and told his business partner about the huge sums fellow rapper 50 Cent was making from selling branded trainers. Contemporaries such as Jay Z and P. Diddy (Puff Daddy), were also raking in vast amounts from ventures outside music. Iovine, a recording industry veteran and chairman of Universal Music Group\u2019s Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records, listened attentively, then said: \u201cDre man, we need to do something. But this is not us. Nobody cares what sneakers you wear. Screw sneakers, let\u2019s make speakers; let\u2019s get into sound.\u201d Within a few months of their walk in 2006, the pair formally established Beats Electronics \u2013 the speaker and headphones maker that has since made Dr Dre the first rap billionaire and cemented his position as the brightest star in the \u201chip-hopreneur\u201d firmament. Since the launch of the first headphones in 2008, Beats by Dre\u2019s audio equipment has swept all before it, aided by a string of celebrity endorsements. Last May, it secured its biggest endorsement yet when Apple agreed to stump up a mammoth $3.2bn (\u00a32bn) for the electronics business. Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, said at the time: \u201cWe have known these guys forever; we\u2019ve dated, we\u2019ve gone steady and now we\u2019re getting married.\u201d The 49-year-old rap producer is now just as well known on Wall Street for his business savvy as he is in the housing projects of LA and New York for his music. The Apple deal set a new highwater mark for the growing tribe of rap moguls who are keen to marry commerce with art and Dr Dre was top of the pile with estimated pre-tax earnings of $620m in 2014, according to the latest Forbes annual Hip Hop Cash Kings list of rap music\u2019s richest, released in September. That was the largest sum earned in a single year by any entertainer ever measured by Forbes and was easily more than the other 24 members of the Cash Kings list combined. The producer was streets ahead of his closest contenders \u2013 Jay Z and P. Diddy, both with $60m. The top 10 artists raked in a combined $922m in the year. Despite dominating the Forbes list, Dr Dre, otherwise known as Andre Young, is by no means the only hip-hopreneur on the block. So why do some rap artists take so readily to the boardroom? Dan Charnas, a former hip-hop producer and author of The Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip-Hop, reckons the entrepreneurial spirit shown by the likes of Dr Dre and Jay Z was already embedded in the culture, because \u201chip-hop was always aspirational\u201d. Some leading rappers credit their business success to their formative experiences \u2013 wheeling and dealing in drugs and stolen goods to make a living. Jay Z, aka Shawn Carter, started out as a drug dealer in New York and soon realised he could expand operations to areas such as Maryland and Virginia, where, one of his biographers observed, \u201cthe competition was lighter and the clientele less sophisticated\u201d. He now sits atop a burgeoning business empire that includes the Rocaware clothing range, 9IX fragrances, Roc Nation sports agency, Armand de Brignac Champagne, and a stake in NBA basketball team the Brooklyn Nets. Not all of Jay Z\u2019s ventures have succeeded. He famously trademarked a specific shade of blue \u2013 Jay Z Blue \u2013 which he hoped to exploit, starting with making it the paintwork on a branded Chrysler luxury SUV. That did not work out, but such mis-steps don\u2019t seem to have tarnished the rapper\u2019s brand. P. Diddy, aka Sean Combs, also owns a clothing range, called Sean John, as well as Ciroc liqueur, Blue Flame marketing agency and Revolt TV network. Other notable hip-hopreneurs include Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d\u2019 Jackson who was asked to be a brand ambassador for the soft drink Vitaminwater. Jackson shrewdly negotiated a 5% equity stake in the business that was eventually sold for $4bn. As rap has moved over the years into the musical mainstream, the shift in public perception coincided with huge changes in the music industry. Between 2004 and 2010, the value of the global recorded music industry fell by around 31%, according to trade body IFPI, as illegal copying and distribution were made easier by the internet. Artists realised they needed additional sources of income to match the jet-set lifestyle of their forbears. In order to increase their cashflow acts began ramping up their concert tours, taking in more cities and making the shows even more spectacular. The music trade publication Pollstar found that the average cost of a ticket for one of America\u2019s top 100 concert tours has mushroomed from $25.81 in 1996 to $62.57 in 2009. To grab the biggest slice of the profits from concerts, artists must play stadium gigs that can accommodate 50,000 to 80,000 people, rather than an arena tour in front of 10,000 to 20,000. For artists that can\u2019t yet attract the crowds to fill a stadium it makes sense for them to co-headline and share the spoils. The rap world has been quick to spot the potential of a blockbuster tour with other big name hip-hop artists. Jay Z\u2019s sold out Hard Knock Life show, along with DMX, Method Man and Redman, and the recent Drake v Lil Wayne tour have demonstrated the rap world\u2019s shrewd acceptance of the potential financial benefits of collaboration. In musical terms, British rappers, such as Dizzee Rascal and The Streets, have had huge success that thrust them into the limelight and headline big UK festivals. But there is no evidence yet that Britain\u2019s finest have quite the same entrepreneurial zeal as their American counterparts. Dizzee Rascal has a few low-profile business interests, including a record label, Dirtee Stank, and Dirtee TV production company. But the east London rapper\u2019s commercial moves pale into insignificance when compared with some of the titans of Britain\u2019s pop industry. One Direction and Little Mix, managed by Simon Cowell\u2019s Syco organisation, have an extensive portfolio of money-spinning activities from perfume to clothing ranges, make up and look-alike dolls. Even Liam Gallagher, former Oasis front man, aims to keep the tills ringing with his clothing business Pretty Green. Hip-hop\u2019s transformation from outlaw block parties in the South Bronx into a global cultural powerhouse has been phenomenal. Corporations, once keen to distance themselves from the foul-mouthed street gangster image of the music, are clambering on the bandwagon as they try to woo a younger generation of consumers. Attaching the name of the latest hot street artist to a new line of Nike clothing may make both sides lots of money. To make the really big bucks requires something more \u2013 a bit of vision. For Apple, the real prize was Beats Music, its music-streaming subsidiary. It will help the iPhone maker combat the growing popularity of rival streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora. Apple has dominated the digital music download market through its iTunes service for the past decade, but upstart streaming operators threaten to usurp it. Revenues from music subscription services ballooned by 51.3% in 2013, exceeding $1bn for the first time. Streaming is the fastest-growing part of the music sales market - the number of paying subscribers jumped to 28m in 2013 from just 8m in 2010 (source: IFPI). As the Beats impresario once rapped: \u201cDr Dre is the name, I\u2019m ahead of my game.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Belgium has been hit by one of the biggest strikes in years, as European protests against austerity pick up pace. Flights and train services have been cancelled, while schools and government offices were shut, as unions protested against plans to raise the retirement age, cut services and cancel a regular pay increase. Coverage starts here Strikers blockaged roads from dawn, and there have been clashes with riot police in the capital today (photos). Marie-Helene Ska, the head of the Christian CSC union, declared: \u201cThere has never been a strike this strong,\u201d Full story: Belgium cut off from world by national strike Russia\u2019s economic crisis has deepened, as the rouble crashed to record lows agains the US dollar (see here onwards). The selloff forced the Russian central bank to intervene in the markets again, traders say, after last week\u2019s interest rate rise failed to calm the situation. But in late trading, the rouble is down over 9% at 63.8 to the $1. The scale of the slump could prompt the Kremlin into capital controls, analysts believe. Fears over companies\u2019 ability to service their debts hit corporate bond prices today, and wiped over 6% off the RTS index of leading shares. Details here Stock markets have been volatile \u2013 Asian markets hit a nine-month low, while a late selloff in Europe wiped another 118 points off the FTSE 100. Thailand, meanwhile, suffered a remarkable tumble and rebound: And over in Greece, EC commissioner Pierre Moscovici has been meeting with the prime minister to discuss the road ahead. The latest opinion poll has shown Samaras\u2019s New Democracy party lagging behind the left-wing Syriza, but the gap is narrowing.... And in the UK.... a fare-dodging fund manager has been banned from the City, and the former boss of JJB Sports has been jailed for four years for fraud. FCA bans \u00a343,000 fare dodger from working in financial services Ex-JJB Sports chief jailed for fraud It looks like the FTSE 100 just set its lowest close of the year: Fears over the state of the world economy, Russia\u2019s deepening currency crisis and the weakening oil price have combined to send European markets deep into the red tonight. The FTSE just closed down 117 points at 6182, a decline of 1.89%. After an early rally this morning, the Footsie ended up taking another kicking to add to last week\u2019s selloff. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG says the traditional pre-Christmas rally has been cancelled. We\u2019re evidently still in a \u2018sell the rally\u2019 kind of mode. Santa rallies might be the norm, but blindly rushing is a bad idea at any time of the year and there will be a few overeager buyers nursing losses this afternoon. There were even deeper falls across Europe; Germany\u2019s DAX shed 2.7%, France\u2019s CAC fell 2.5%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dropped 2.8%. Energy and mining companies led the selloff in London, reflecting concerns about global growth and the decline in the oil price this afternoon (Brent crude is now down 1% tonight at $61.36/barrel). The rouble isn\u2019t the only currency in trouble \u2013 the Turkish lira has hit an 11-month low. This follows the arrest of 23 people yesterday, including journalists, producers, scriptwriters, directors, police officers and two former police chiefs. Europe\u2019s markets are a sea of electronic red as trading grinds to a close. The rouble has now suffered a staggering selloff, down around 7% against the US dollar. That\u2019s an astounding drop for a currency. The declines deepened after the Russian central bank warned of a deeper recession, with higher inflation, if the oil price does not recover. The slump in the rouble is likely to have prompted Moscow insiders to ponder implementing capital controls to stop capital fleeing the country. Neil Shearing, analyst at Capital Economics, reckons that Kremlin hardliners are pushing for controls: There is already a growing debate within some circles of government over the merits of a more isolationist model of economic development. Some commentators have argued that, in the extreme, capital controls could be accompanied by a restructuring (i.e. default) of external debts by major quasi-public enterprises. Shearing reckons Russia could impose \u201clow-level\u201d capital controls, such as forcing Russian companies to convert half of their export revenue into roubles. But a widescale clampdown on the movement of money is unlikely, for three reasons: First, controls to prevent outflows have a history of being porous. If money wants to get out, it tends to find a way...... Second, legislation to compel a certain proportion of export receipts to be switched into rubles is likely to have limited impact, since we suspect that most revenues are already switched into local currency. Around two-thirds of exports are oil and related products and high marginal tax rates on these sectors mean that most revenues are switched into rubles in order to pay the government. Finally, the imposition of capital controls would eliminate any remaining credibility that Russia has in international markets. Admittedly, credibility is already in short supply. But it is wrong to assume that all investment into Russia has now been cut off \u2013 inflows of FDI totalled $24bn in the first half of this year. More fundamentally, with lower oil prices having eroded the current account surplus, Russia will need to attract increasingly large inflows of foreign financing to fund investment and thus growth over the long-run. So, capital controls would inflict substantial long-run pain, Shearing concludes.... The selloff in the rouble is accelerating - it\u2019s just hit 62 to the dollar, a new record, down from the 58/$1 on Friday night. It\u2019s taken a while, but Europe\u2019s stock markets are finally showing the sort of losses we were predicting before dawn broke over the City eight hours ago. The FTSE 100 is down 45 points, or 0.7%, and the French CAC and German DAC are showing similar falls. The unexpected rally in energy stocks has petered out, and that\u2019s because the oil price has now surrendered today\u2019s gains. Brent crude is flat, and US crude is down 1% at $57.17 per barrel. The Russian central bank has warned that next year\u2019s recession will be deeper than feared, unless the oil price recovers, reports Reuters: RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK SAYS ECONOMY COULD CONTRACT BY AROUND 4.5% IN 2015 IF OIL PRICES ARE AT $60 A BARREL - DOCUMENT Better economic news from America: industrial output across the country rose by 1.3% last month, the biggest rise in over four years. That\u2019s a remarkable contrast with the disappointing Empire state survey 45 minutes ago, which showed a slowdown this month. The slump in the rouble has sparked a sell-off on the Moscow stock exchange. The RTS index (priced in dollars), has tumbled by 6.6% today, to its lowest level in over five years: Concern is swirling that the weakening ruble will wreck havoc on the Russian economy, which is heading into recession. Russian corporate bonds have also fallen sharply today, reflecting fears that firms will struggle to repay debt priced in dollars. Back to Belgium, and photos of clashes between union members and riot police in Brussels have landed: Breaking: America\u2019s factory sector has suffered an unexpected setback. The closely-watched US Empire manufacturing survey showed a drop in activity, new orders index and shipments in December. This dragged the Empire index down to -3.6, the first negative reading of this year. This is going to raise new fears about the state of the US economy, and beyond. European stock markets have already reacted - the FTSE 100 is now down 11 points, as this morning\u2019s surprise rally fades And speaking of Greece, the latest opinion polls show that the opposition left-wing Syriza party\u2019s lead has narrowed, to just over 3%. Syriza had held a five-point lead, before the government raised the prospect of early general election by rushing forward the vote to elect Greece\u2019s next president to this month. Over in Athens, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has arrived for talks with the prime minister, Antonis Samaras. As explained this morning (8.04am), Moscovici\u2019s visit has been attacked by opposition politicians, who aren\u2019t convinced that the former French finance minister is really here to show solidarity. Here\u2019s a Christmas party game: Spot the emergency intervention.... The fall in the value of the rouble is turning into a rout; it just hit a record low of 61 (!) roubles to the US dollar as fears swirl over the stability of the Russian economy. But then it bounced back - perhaps an intervention by the Central Bank? This Reuters newsflash that it was clamping down on certain market speculation may have also calmed the situation: RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK SAYS HAS SENT ORDER TO MOSCOW EXCHANGE TO HALT TRADING IN CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS TO PREVENT POSSIBLE MANIPULATION OF EQUITY FUTURES MARKET This chart shows how the rouble is poised to overtake the yen as the worst-performing currency of 2014: POP. The rouble has just hit another unenviable milestone - sliding to 60 to the US dollar for the first time ever. Just a number, of course, so nothing to get too excited about. It\u2019s the broad trend that is important. The rouble is down another 3% today. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Moscow bureau chief is also struck that the rouble hasn\u2019t felt any benefit from the rising oil price today. Clearly last week\u2019s interest rate hike, from 9.5% to 10.5%, hasn\u2019t restored any confidence in the rouble. The ruble\u2019s on the cusp of hitting the 60/$1 mark.... Back in the markets, the Russian rouble is racking up fresh record lows. It has lost more than 2% today to hit 59.7 roubles to the US dollar, its weakest rate on record. As flagged up earlier, the prospect of America imposing tougher sanctions is hurting the rouble. Moscow must be worried that the rouble has not benefitted from the recovery in the oil price this morning. AFP have filed a good take on today\u2019s protests in Belgium: Belgium cut off from world by national strike Belgium ground to a halt in its biggest strike in years Monday as trade unions grounded flights, cut international rail links and shut sea ports to protest the new government\u2019s austerity plans. In the climax to a month of industrial action against new Prime Minister Charles Michel\u2019s policies, striking workers stopped all public transport while most schools, businesses and government offices shut down. Pickets also blocked traffic outside the Brussels headquarters of the European Union, a 28-nation bloc that has seen years of protests against austerity aimed at cutting debts that threatened the euro currency. The Belgian strike came days after a day of protest in Italy against Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s ambitious reform plans, while there have been similar demonstrations in Spain and Greece in recent months. \u201cThere has never been a strike this strong,\u201d Marie-Helene Ska, the head of the Christian CSC union, was quoted as saying by the Belga news agency. Belgian trade unions launched their movement last month with a march of more than 100,000 people in Brussels, which ended in violent protests that left dozens of police officers injured. - PM won\u2019t budge - Unions went ahead with Monday\u2019s general strike after premier Michel\u2019s right-of-centre government refused to budge on plans to save \u20ac11bn ($13.7bn) over five years. His coalition, which took office in October, intends to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 from 2030, scrap plans for a usually automatic cost-of-living raise next year and introduce public sector cutbacks. French-speaking Michel - who at 38 is Belgium\u2019s youngest prime minister since 1840 - heads a coalition of three Flemish-speaking right-leaning parties and his own Francophone liberals. The government formed five months after elections had hoped to calm a nation deeply divided between the richer Flanders and the poorer French-speaking Wallonia, but instead has led to weeks of industrial action. The last national strike in Belgium was in 2012 against the government of socialist prime minister Elio di Rupo. Belgian airspace was closed after air traffic controllers joined the strike, preventing flights from landing or taking off from airports in Brussels, Charleroi, Liege, Antwerp and Ostend for 24 hours from 2100 GMT Sunday. Some 50,000 passengers have been affected as a total of 600 incoming and outgoing flights have been cancelled at Brussels international airport, spokeswoman Florence Muls said. - \u2018A real disaster\u2019 - \u201cAll flights are cancelled. Everything is immobilised,\u201d Muls told AFP, adding that it had affected some travellers trying to get away early for the Christmas holidays. \u201cIt\u2019s a real disaster\u201d for the airports and passengers, Jean-Jacques Cloquet, managing director of Charleroi said on the RTBF news website, adding there would be a knock-on effect during the busy holiday period. Eurostar rail services from Brussels to the British capital London and trains to the French capital Paris, Amsterdam in the Netherlands and the German city of Cologne have also been halted until early Tuesday. Belgian rail SNCB said domestic inter-city train services were cancelled and trams, buses and metro services were all cancelled, leading many people to take the day off work and stay home. The strike is also likely to affect post offices and rubbish collections, prisons and the courts. Protesters erected road barriers that snarled traffic in Brussels and other cities, and could be seen warming their hands by flaming braziers while brandishing banners and handing out leaflets. Union leader Ska denied that they wanted to bring down the government. \u201cThe government was elected democratically. We do not challenge it at all,\u201d Ska said on Belgian television. \u201cWhat we want is to know where Belgium will be in five years on social matters.\u201d A former fund manager at investment management firm BlackRock has been shunted out of the City, for fare-dodging. The Financial Conduct Authority has ruled that Jonathan Paul Burrows failed its \u201cfit and proper\u201d test, meaning he is banned from performing any regulated activities. In November 2013 Burrows was caught at Cannon Street Station without a valid purchase for his journey from East Sussex. He admitted evading his rail fares on a number of occasions, the FCA says. Tracey McDermott, the FCA\u2019s Director of Enforcement and Financial Crime, said such behaviour can\u2019t be tolerated: \u201cBurrows held a senior position within the financial services industry. His conduct fell short of the standards we expect. Approved persons must act with honesty and integrity at all times and, where they do not, we will take action.\u201d Burrows was able to avoid the full fare because his East Sussex station didn\u2019t have a ticket gate, and he could \u2018tap out\u2019 at Cannon Street using an Oyster card - paying \u00a37.20 rather than \u00a321.50. Which adds up, after a while.... Today\u2019s general strike has left Eurostar unable to run services to Brussels - passengers can only travel between London and Lille today. Back in the financial markets, the oil price is staging a decent recovery...and dragging European markets up with it. Brent crude has gained almost 2%, or $1.12 per barrel this morning, reversing some of its whopping losses since September. The rare sight of crude oil going UP has sent investors racing to buy shares in energy companies. Tullow Oil have jumped 5%, BG Group and Weir Group are up 3%, and Royal Dutch Shell has gained 2.5%. This has sent the FTSE 100 up by 50 points, dashing those fears that we might see another selloff. Tamas Varga, energy analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates, reckons there\u2019s some speculative buying after last week\u2019s slide: \u201cThe market may just have moved down too far too quickly today,\u201d Last week, the falling oil price helped to wipe 342 points off the FTSE 100 last week, so some optimism is overdue. Most other European markets are showing gains today: Today\u2019s Belgium strike comes just three days after a big anti-austerity protest in Italy, and a pick-up in demonstrations in Greece recently. European unrest is on the rise. With the mercury bobbing around 5\u00b0C, and rain in the air, it\u2019s not the best day to be demonstrating in Belgium. These strikers outside an IKEA store in the municipality of Sint Pieters Leeuw have knocked up a small fire to keep warm (not burning IKEA stock, we trust) Frazer Goodwin, senior advocacy adviser at Save the Children\u2019s EU Office in Brussels, reports that the roads are unusually quiet: Today\u2019s general strike in Belgium is expected to be the biggest in years. Unions are ratcheting up the pressure on prime minister Charles Michel by taking the country\u2019s infrastructure offline for a day, starting at 10pm last night. As these photos show, demonstrators were out in force before dawn broke: European anger over austerity is on display in Belgium today, where workers are holding a massive general strike. Air and rail services, schools, businesses and government offices are all affected as unions show their opposition to the government\u2019s budget for 2015. Around 600 flights are expected to be cancelled; the managing director of Brussels Charleroi Airport has called it a \u201creal disaster\u201d. Thousands of hospital operations have been cancelled. There are reports that some motorways could be blockaded \u2013 something business groups have said would be unacceptable. Unions are protesting against the Belgium government\u2019s plans to save money by scrapping a cost-of-living increase next year, raising the retirement age from 65 to 67, and cutting social services. Those austerity measures are meant to help Belgium hit the deficit targets demanded by the European Commission. Protestors are also targeting the EC\u2019s offices in Brussels. There are some huge losses on the Thai stock market today. Here\u2019s the biggest fallers in today\u2019s rout: And Malaysia\u2019s market is down 2%, also helping to pull Asian markets to a nine-month low today. Thailand\u2019s stock market is suffering a huge fall today, the biggest since the collapse of Lehman Brothers six years ago. The selloff appears to be driven by a selloff in energy firms, and fears that valuations have simply got too high. Bloomberg reports: \u201cThai stocks have been hit by foreign selling as investors pull out from emerging markets,\u201d said Mixo Das, an Asia ex-Japan equity strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore. \u201cA large listed oil-and-gas sector and expensive valuations relative to history are adding more pressure.\u201d Economists have been warning that money may flow out of emerging markets once the US Federal Reserve begins to tighten its very loose monetary policy (which had driven money into emerging economies in search of decent returns) Quite a contrast with Europe, where the major markets are pretty flat at the open (so far....) The Russian rouble has begun the week by shedding more value, as Moscow traders fear the impact of new Western sanctions. The rouble fell 0.7% to a new record low, hitting 58.79 roubles to the US dollar. Reuters explains why: After Russian markets closed last week, the U.S. Congress passed a bill setting out tougher sanctions on Moscow and authorising the supply of military aid to Ukraine. The bill \u201cwill be negative for market sentiment,\u201d analysts at Sberbank investment research wrote in a note. Europe\u2019s stock markets are open..... and shares are doing rather better than expected. Energy stocks in London are staging a surprise recovery, helping to keep the main indices flat in early trading. The FTSE 100\u2019s list of top risers is dominated by oil firms: And that\u2019s because the crude oil price is, finally, staging a small rally. Brent crude is up 0.7% today at $62.42 per barrel. Pierre Moscovici, Europe\u2019s economic and financial affairs commissioner, is heading to Greece today for talks with the government. He arrives in Athens two days before MPs hold the first ballot to elect (or more likely reject) a new president. Moscovici has claimed he is showing \u2018solidarity\u2019 with Greece, telling the Kathimerini newspaper in an interview that: I have always said that we need Greece in the eurozone and we need a strong Greece. But his visit has angered the leader of the Syriza party, who fears EC officials are trying to subvert the democratic process. Alexis Tsipras declared yesterday: \u201cAn operation of terror, of lies, is underway... An operation whose only aim is to sow terror among the Greek people and MPs, and to thrust the country ever deeper into the poverty and uncertainty of the memorandum [bailout agreement]. Full story: Greece election: EU finance chief flies into Athens as Grexit fears mount IG predicts that the main European markets will fall by around 1% at the open, following Asia\u2019s lead: Their Stan Shamu says: Greece will remain a main point of focus this week with the first round of presidential elections taking place on December 17. Given Greece was a big source of volatility last week, this should be a key event for fixed income and in turn the single currency and equities. Here\u2019s IG\u2019s opening calls: FTSE 100: down 61 points at 6240 German DAX: down 51 points at 9544 French CAC: down 36 points at 4073 Spanish IBEX: down 67 points at 10078 Italian MIB: down 61 points at 18540. Asian traders didn\u2019t take much comfort from Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s election win yesterday. The main index of Asia-Pacific shares, calculated by MSCI, hit its lowest level since March at one point, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei dropping by 1.6%. The selloff came after the oil price hit a new five-and-a-half year low at the start of trading (before rallying a little), underlining global growth concerns. There was also gloom in Tokyo after the Bank of Japan\u2019s Tankan survey showed that confidence among Japan\u2019s big manufacturers worsened in the last three months. Marcel Thieliant, Japan economist at Capital Economics, says: \u201cToday\u2019s Tankan survey suggests that Japan\u2019s economy stabilized in the fourth quarter, but a rapid recovery is not on the cards.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. It\u2019s a new week, but the old fears that sparked the biggest decline in over two years last week haven\u2019t abated. European markets are expected to fall again this morning, with investors fretting about a range of issues. They include: Greece\u2019s political crisis, with presidential elections starting this week. The oil price rout, and its impact on energy companies The eurozone\u2019s stagnation, and uncertainty over The prospect of US interest rates rising in 2015, the US Federal Reserve could tweak its forward guidance on Wednesday. The state of the global economy, given recent disappointing data from China Japan\u2019s prospects, now prime minister Shinzo Abe has won re-election So, no excuse for party hats on the City trading floors. Ian Williams, analyst at Peel Hunt, comments: The final month of 2014 is proving much more eventful than investors expected, and not in a good way. Last week saw a surge in volatility measures and a renewed flight to safe havens across most asset markets; a timely reminder, as the (primarily bullish) previews of the outlook for 2015 begin to emerge, that markets still face a wide range of economic and political challenges moving into the new year. The European economic calendar is rather bare today, but we do get a survey of British factories this morning, and various US data this afternoon: 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends survey 1.30pm GMT: US New York Federal Reserve\u2019s manufacturing survey 2.15pm GMT: US industrial output for November. 3pm GMT: US NAHB housing market index I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Some commentators have argued that, in the extreme, capital controls could be accompanied by a restructuring (i.e. default) of external debts by major quasi-public enterprises. </p> </blockquote> <p>Shearing reckons Russia could impose \u201clow-level\u201d capital controls, such as forcing Russian companies to convert half of their export revenue into roubles.</p> <p>But a widescale clampdown on the movement of money is unlikely, for three reasons:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>First, controls to prevent outflows have a history of being porous</strong>. If money wants to get out, it tends to find a way......</p> <p><strong>Second, legislation to compel a certain proportion of export receipts to be switched into rubles is likely to have limited impact, since we suspect that most revenues are already switched into local currency.</strong> Around two-thirds of exports are oil and related products and high marginal tax rates on these sectors mean that most revenues are switched into rubles in order to pay the government. </p> <p><strong>Finally, the imposition of capital controls would eliminate any remaining credibility that Russia has in international markets. </strong>Admittedly, credibility is already in short supply.

      "bodyText": "A former City executive has been banned for life from any senior role in the financial services industry, after being exposed as one of the UK\u2019s biggest train fare dodgers. Jonathan Paul Burrows, a former managing director at Blackrock Asset Management, has been barred by the Financial Conduct Authority from taking any responsible role in the financial services industry. Announcing the ban, the FCA\u2019s director of enforcement and financial crime, Tracey McDermott, said: \u201cBurrows held a senior position within the financial services industry. His conduct fell short of the standards we expect. Approved persons must act with honesty and integrity at all times and, where they do not, we will take action.\u201d His dishonest behaviour came to the attention of the City watchdog after it came to light that he had saved himself almost \u00a343,000 over several years by exploiting a loophole at the ticket barriers. The East Sussex commuter boarded the London-bound train at Stonegate, a rural station with no ticket barriers. When he arrived at Cannon Street station in London, he tapped in using an Oyster card, paying a \u00a37.20 fare, rather than the \u00a321.50 cost of his journey. Burrows avoided prosecution after making an out-of-court-settlement with Southeastern railways, but had to resign from his high-flying job at Blackrock after a public outcry. He told the FCA he knew he was breaking the law and had not disclosed his behaviour to his employer. The FCA said they had taken these facts into account when deciding what action to take. Today\u2019s ruling ends Burrows\u2019s lucrative City career. At Blackrock he had reportedly earned \u00a31m a year. He will never again be allowed into a position of authority, although, in theory, he could take junior back-office jobs. In a statement after the FCA ruling, Burrows said: \u201cI have always recognised that what I did was foolish. I have apologised to all concerned and reiterate that apology publicly today.\u201d \u201cWhile I respect the FCA\u2019s decision today, I also regret it, coming as it did after a 20-year career in the City that was without blemish. I recognise that the FCA has on its plate more profound wrongdoing than mine in the financial services sector, and I am sorry that my case has taken up its time at this critical juncture for the future of the City and its reputation.\u201d Last year the FCA banned 43 people from working in senior financial services jobs for failing the \u201cfit and proper\u201d test, but few attracted as much attention as Burrows. The fund manager initially managed to keep his identity secret through an out-of-court settlement that roused the anger of unions. At the time, Manuel Cortes, the leader of the TSSA transport union, said the anonymous agreement showed there was one law for the rich and one for the poor. Burrows\u2019s identity was first revealed by the Daily Mail, who contrasted his \u201ctwo huge, mortgage-free mansions in the East Sussex countryside\u201d with the \u00a34,500 cost of the season ticket. The majority of people subject to an FCA ban have committed offences at work and Burrows is only the second person to be banned by for wrongdoing unrelated to his job. His case follows senior money-market manager Anthony Verrier, who earlier this year accepted an FCA ban , after being censured by a high court judge for dishonesty. Many commuters voiced anger that Burrows avoided prosecution, but others expressed a sneaking admiration that he managed to get away with it for so long. The \u00a343,000 that Burrows repaid to Southeastern trains was calculated on the basis of single fares. This meant the settlement cost him \u00a320,000 more than if he had bought season tickets. \u2022 30 November 2015. To clarify: the sum of \u00a343,000 which was paid to settle this matter out of court does not reflect the value of the unpaid fares alone, which were substantially less.",

Burrows\u2019s identity <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2713784/Unmasked-City-high-flier-Jonathan-Burrows-dodged-43-000-rail-fares-paid-3-days.html\">was first revealed by the Daily Mail</a>, who contrasted his \u201ctwo huge, mortgage-free mansions in the East Sussex countryside\u201d with the \u00a34,500 cost of the season ticket.</p> <p>The majority of people subject to an FCA ban have committed offences at work and Burrows is only the second person to be banned by for wrongdoing unrelated to his job. His case follows senior money-market manager Anthony Verrier, who earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/29/broker-tony-verrier-drops-opposition-lifetime-financial-conduct-authority-ban\">accepted an FCA ban </a>, after being censured by a high court judge for dishonesty.</p> <p>Many commuters voiced anger that Burrows avoided prosecution, but others <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/14/rail-passengers-hedge-fund-fare-dodger-43000-prosecuted-east-sussex-london\">expressed a sneaking admiration</a> that he managed to get away with it for so long.</p> <p>The \u00a343,000 that Burrows repaid to Southeastern trains was calculated on the basis of single fares. This meant the settlement cost him \u00a320,000 more than if he had bought season tickets.</p> <p>\u2022 30 November 2015. To clarify: the sum of \u00a343,000 which was paid to settle this matter out of court does not reflect the value of the unpaid fares alone, which were substantially less. </p>",

Labor accused Hockey of hypocrisy given his strong criticisms of the former Gillard government over revenue write-downs. The chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, Innes Willox, said the results underlined the need for Australia to find multiple sources of economic growth rather than relying solely on resource and energy commodities. The president of the Business Council of Australia, Catherine Livingstone, said the government must tackle intergenerational pressures and fiscal challenges \u201cin conjunction with a concerted strategy to grow the economy\u201d.
