      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Around $36bn has been wiped off Facebook\u2019s market capitalisation, after its worst day\u2019s trading in several years. Shares slumped by 6.7% after a whistleblower revealed a vast data breach that affected tens of millions of people. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are demanding answers. In America, senators are pushing for senior executives to be questioned on Capitol Hill. The Connecticut Attorney General is also opening a probe. In the UK, the information commissioner is launching an investigation. The ICO may search the offices of Cambridge Analytica on Tuesday, after Theresa May\u2019s spokesperson expressed concern over the revelations. Tonight, Channel 4 have revealed how the company\u2019s bosses talked of using honey traps, spies and fake news to help clients World stock markets were also dragged down by worries that Donald Trump\u2019s steel and aluminium tariffs would spark a trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 sagged to a 15-month low That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Just in: the Connecticut Attorney General is launching an investigation into Facebook. It will centre on the Observer\u2019s revelations that the Facebook profiles of 50 million people were harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Attorney General George Jepsen says: \u201cNews reports that personal user information from Facebook profiles was provided to third parties without user consent are concerning and raise serious questions about how this happened in the specific situation involving Cambridge Analytica and about Facebook\u2019s policies and practices more generally. Today, my office has in writing initiated an inquiry asking Facebook to answer a series of questions about this matter. While we cannot comment further at this time, Connecticut residents should know that my office takes privacy matters very seriously, and we will move as quickly as we responsibly can to get to the bottom of this situation.\u201d Bloomberg have more details of the growing pressure to make top tech executives face a Capitol Hill grilling: U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have called on the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to bring in technology company CEOs, including from Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, for public questioning In a letter Monday to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, Klobuchar and Kennedy said they have \u201cserious concern regarding recent reports that data from millions of American was misused in order to influence voters.\u201d \u201cThe lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights,\u201d the senators wrote. A hearing with the CEOs would allow the committee to learn \u201cwhat is being done to protect Americans\u2019 data and limit abuse of the platforms, as well as to assess what measures should be taken before the next elections.\u201d Global stock markets are now on their worst run since last November, according to Reuters data. Facebook was obviously one factor behind today\u2019s selloff. But, traders are also worried about a protectionist trade war breaking out. This overshadowed the \u2018Brexit breakthrough\u2019 between the UK and Brussels over a transition deal this morning. Breaking! Around $36bn has been wiped off Facebook\u2019s value today, as trading ends in New York after a rough session. Shares in the embattled social media giant ended down 6.7% at $172.5. That looks to be its biggest one-day loss in four years (and its biggest drop in value ever). That takes Facebook\u2019s market capitalisation down to just over $500bn, from $537bn on Friday night. Other tech stocks also suffered, dragging the Nasdaq down by 1.8%. The broad S&amp;P 500 index fell by 1.4%, with Facebook the biggest faller. Facebook\u2019s decision to hire a data forensic firm to examine the claims against Cambridge Analytica has caused some concern. Particularly as the UK Information Commissioner is planning to obtain a warrant on Tuesday to search its offices. New details of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activities are emerging tonight. Undercover Channel 4 News reporters have recorded CEO Alexander Nix discussing the tactics it used. Here\u2019s a flavour: In a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques. But Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients. When the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation. \u201cOh, we do a lot more than that,\u201d he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. \u201cDeep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that\u2019s too good to be true and make sure that that\u2019s video recorded. Newsflash: Facebook has just released a statement, saying it has hired a forensics firm to investigate the claims against Cambridge Analytica. The social media giant says that Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan, who orchestrated the harvesting of Facebook data, has verbally agreed to take part in the audit. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has \u2018thus far declined\u2019, Facebook says. The Wall Street selloff is gathering pace. Facebook\u2019s problems seem to be sparking wider alarm in the markets, with investors also worried about the risk of a trade war (and the prospect of a US interest rate rise on Wednesday) With just over an hour\u2019s trading to go, the Nasdaq is down almost 3% while the Dow is staring at a 450-point loss (-1.8%). More than $100bn has been wiped off the value of America\u2019s biggest tech companies today. Facebook is the worst performer (-7%), shedding around $35bn at pixel time. According to the Financial Times, that is one of the ten biggest one-day losses (in dollar terms) ever suffered by a technology company. Every member of the Nasdaq is currently in the red; Alphabet/Google is down 3.5%, Amazon are down 2.3%, NVIDIA has lost 4.8%, Apple is off 2% and Microsoft has shed 2.2%. The revelations about how Cambridge Analytica harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles is fuelling calls for tighter regulation of the tech sector. And if that happens, the world\u2019s largest technology firms could find their growth squeezed, making it hard to justify their immense valuations (Facebook is still worth half a trillion dollars, despite today\u2019s share price slide) Jake Dollarhide of Longbow Asset Management believes the implications could be huge. He says (via Reuters): \u201cThere\u2019s the thought that the government might try to regulate tech. You open a slippery slope. If you regulate Facebook what\u2019s to say that wouldn\u2019t have a domino effect. Google, maybe Uber?\u201d What\u2019s to stop the government for getting its fingers in all these areas. People have thought right now the tech growth rate has no boundaries, no ceiling. Today people are beginning to question that. If it\u2019s the case now, will it still be the case in the future.\u201d US senator Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota, is calling for top tech executives including Mark Zuckerberg to be called to account: Facebook\u2019s share price is stubbornly in the red, and on track for its worst day in five years: The UK government has weighed in on the unfolding Facebook data story. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman has said the PM backs an investigation by the information commissioner into the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, adding: The allegations are clearly very concerning, it\u2019s essential people can have confidence that their personal data can be protected and used in an appropriate way. More here: It\u2019s a grim start to the week for stock markets, as a combination of factors leave investors nursing losses. The technology sector has been hit by the Facebook controversy, and in the UK, the slump in Micro Focus shares following a profit warning. There is also nervousness ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, which is expected to sanction another interest rate rise. The interest will be in seeing whether new Fed chair Jerome Powell hints at three or four increases in total this year. Signs of some agreement in the Brexit transition talks has lifted the pound to a one month high against the dollar. But the strength of sterling has helped push the FTSE 100 to its lowest level since December 2016. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 121.21 points or 1.69% to 7042.93 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.39% to 12,217.02 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.13% at 5222.84 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.98% lower at 22,633.10 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.99% at 9664.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.79% to 807.44 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 429 points or 1.72%. The Facebook controversy means investors are shying away from risk in general, sayd Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets are in full retreat this afternoon, and the drop has been exemplified by a triple-digit decline on the FTSE 100. The index has returned to December 2016 levels, a remarkable change from last when it was riding high above 7200. Devoid of big macro data, investors have focused on the growing scandal at Facebook and this has resulted in a full-blown flight from risk. Investors have begun to fear that the social media giant has encountered its first real obstacle, and that further investigation will uncover other data breaches. The market has been in love with Facebook for a long time now, but with questions surrounding other tech giants and their use of data, it could be only a matter of time until others of the hitherto untouchable \u2018FANG\u2019 stocks find themselves dragged into an official investigation. Another retailer in trouble, as US jewellery and accessories group Claire\u2019s files for bankruptcy. The company said its international operations were not included but it does plan to cut back on the number of its stores in Europe. The full story is here: Meanwhile in the UK, Carpetright shares are down 17.5% and Mothercare has lost 12.5% as investors fret about store closures and future prospects for both chains. It\u2019s not getting any better for Facebook. It\u2019s shares are now down 7% in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. The technology gloom on both sides of the Atlantic, including worries about an EU tax and in the UK the slump in Micro Focus shares, is one of the reasons for the day\u2019s market weakness. On Wall Street the Nasdaq Composite is down 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 280 points or 1.1%. Investors are also nervous ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. A rate rise announcement on Wednesday is almost a done deal, but there is much nervousness about whether there will be three or four increases in total this year. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.89% lower while the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.59%, not helped by a stronger pound after positive noises from the Brexit negotiations. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: A sharp decline in tech stocks, US politcal tension between and a \u2018death cross\u2019 on Germany\u2019s benchmark DAX index were all weighing on sentiment. Investors are extra touchy in the lead up to Wednesday\u2019s FOMC meeting and the first press conference from new Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The death cross, when the 50 day moving average crosses below the two-hundred day moving average, is a technical indication that the price trend for German stocks has turned downwards. Tech stocks saw some of the biggest declines on the day. Facebook\u2019s monopoly on personal data has put the company under the microscope again. There has been public outcry over the use of personal data harvested from Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica for use in election campaigns. The latest data scandal might well be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back for tighter industry regulation. Tighter regulation of how data is collected and used will inevitably curb growth for tech and social media companies that use the data to attract advertisers. Back with Facebook, and the company could now face regulation, sayis Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank: Facebook shares are down almost 4% as the Cambridge Analytica Files were revealed over the weekend by the Guardian. The files expose a major data scandal that Facebook did little to contain or correct. This scandal will fuel into the Mueller investigation and potentially pave the way for the regulation of Facebook as the social media platform is a national security asset because people\u2019s behaviour can be impacted through the network. Garney also warns about the impact of the EU Commission considering a technology tax of 3% on revenues: This is move to make technology companies, that are extensively using transfer pricing to avoid taxes in high tax rate countries, to pay more to society. These are just the first signs that major technology companies will be more regulated in the future. It is key for long-term investors in technology to have this on the radar. On a day when markets in Europe and the US are heavily in negative territory, Barclays is one exception to the rule. The bank\u2019s shares are up nearly 4% after it emerged that activist investor Edward Bramson had taken control of a 5% stake through his Sherborne Investors. It owns 1.94% of the bank\u2019s shares directly and the rest of the 5% through derivatives. Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said: Sherborne has built a formidable reputation for squeezing improved financial and operational performance from the companies in which it invests and Edward Bramson clearly feels that Barclays shares are going cheap, given the prevailing discount to the book, or net asset value. The question now is what the activist investor thinks Barclays should be doing differently and how he intends to get those views across to the bank\u2019s boss, Jes Staley. The fall in Facebook\u2019s value has also hit founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal wealth. His stake in the business has fallen by around $4bn in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. But don\u2019t worry too much. He is still worth around $71bn, making him the world\u2019s fourth richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Today\u2019s sell off has wiped some $27bn off Facebook\u2019s value, as investors react to the revelations about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica. Breaking: Shares in Facebook have fallen at the start of trading in New York, after the social media giant was hit by a major data scandal. Yesterday, the Observer reported that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the Facebook profiles of millions of US voters, and used them to built a sophisticated tools to predict, and influence, how they would vote. The disclosure creates some huge questions for Facebook, as Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump\u2019s successful election campaign. As my colleague Carole Cadwalladr reported: Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: \u201cWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people\u2019s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\u201d Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. Facebook is now facing criticism from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. There are with suggestions that founder Mark Zuckerberg could be summoned to the UK parliament to answer questions. Conservative MP Damian Collins, who chairs the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, has said he plans to recall Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO to explain why he told MPs last month that his company had not received data from Facebook. Collins says: \u201cWe will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments\u201d. Tech shares are also being hit by reports that Brussels is preparing to impose a digital tax on the EU revenues of companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple. Facebook is leading the selloff, falling from $185 per share to below $176 in early trading. Ding ding. The New York stock market has opened, and stocks are dropping in a broad-based selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed around 100 points, or 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1%. Adam Leyland of The Grocer reckons the Conviviality crisis began after it floated on the stock market in 2013, and started executing ambitious takeover deal to consolidate the drinks trade. He point out that the company changed CFOs last autumn, and has also been hit by recent bad weather and the post-festive slump. Leyland writes: It seems incredible that a business could unravel as quickly as Conviviality has. But with tighter margins and sales commonplace after Christmas, plus tough trading and the snow to contend with, it\u2019s not inconceivable that an operation can quickly lose control of cashflow. And you lose it at your peril. The Grocer: Why has Conviviality spent out on company-owned stores? Newsflash: The CEO of Conviviality, which owns the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains, has resigned. Diana Hunter has stepped down with immediate effect, the company says, less than a week after the company\u2019s shares were suspended after two profits warnings. Conviviality is in a pickle. Firstly, it revealed that a spreadsheet error meant profits this year would be \u00a35.2m lower than expected. That was compounded last week when it discovered an unpaid \u00a330m tax bill. Conviviality, which is also a drinks wholesaler, is urgently seeking fresh funds from investors. Last week, Sky News reported that some were demanding Hunter\u2019s exit in return for their support. Brexit means colour-coding! The new draft Brexit deal text has been neatly shaded to show areas where there is full agreement (green), political agreement (yellow) and areas which are still under discussion (white0). It\u2019s official! Britain and the EU have taken a \u201cdecisive step\u201d towards withdrawal agreement, says Michel Barnier in Brussels. After intensive work, the two sides have jointly published a new version of the draft withdrawal deal for Brexit, says Barnier at his joint press-conference with David Davis. This includes \u201ccomplete accord\u201d on citizens right and Britain\u2019s financial settlement. But.. Barnier also cautions that a step is just a step - a lot of work remains to be done, especially on the Ireland border issue. So, they\u2019re closer, but they\u2019re not there yet. The pound is pushing a little higher, now up 0.7% against both the US dollar (to $1.405), and the euro (to \u20ac1.147). Politics Live has full details. Disappointingly, another 46 Carillion workers have been made redundant today by the Official Receiver. The receiver was unable to find fresh employment for these staff, following Carillion\u2019s fall into liquidation two months ago. This takes the total laid off to 1,582. In better news, 71 workers have been successfully transferred to a new supplier, which means 8,592 jobs have been saved - or almost half Carillion\u2019s workers. That leaves around 7,000 workers who are still working on outsourced public or private sector contracts which haven\u2019t yet been transferred to a new operator, or cancelled. The surge in the pound is helping to drag Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 down to a two-week low. Micro Focus is also doing its bit - shares are down a staggering 55% after this morning\u2019s gloomy update. This has helped wipe 90 points off the Footsie, or 1.2%. Other European markets are also starting the new week rather, er, weakly, with losses in Frankfurt (-0.9%), Paris (-0.7%), Milan (-0.4%) and Madrid (-0.5%) Investors are edgy ahead of several big news events this week, including the G20 finance ministers meeting in Buenos Aires (ending tomorrow), and Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting which is likely to lead to a hike in US interest rates. Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s first press conference since replacing Janet Yellen will give the markets an insight into his thinking, and the likely pace of future rate hikes. A frisson of excitement is rippling through the foreign exchange floors, amid rumours of a Brexit breakthough. Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary David David is meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier now, ahead of the crunch EU summit later this week. And there are rumours that the two men will announce that the \u2018broad\u2019 terms of a transition deal have been agreed. If so, that would calm fears that Britain would crash over the cliff-edge into a hard Brexit in March 2019. The pound has gained almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.40, and is up 0.5% against the euro to \u20ac1.14 (both the highest levels since February) Barnier and Davis are due to hold a press conference at around 12.45pm Brussels time (11.45am GMT). Our Politics Live blog will have all the action (plus the latest on the Skripal poisoning). Back to GKN.... and Melrose has swiftly rubbished today\u2019s news that America\u2019s Dana will list shares in London if it succeeds in merging with GKN\u2019s auto business. A Melrose spokeswoman argues that City investors will still lose out, due to London\u2019s listing rules. \u2018A secondary UK listing will make little difference to the problems it creates for UK holders with Ohio-headquartered Dana maintaining its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Without a primary UK listing the shares will remain outside the investment mandate of many UK funds who benchmark their performance against the UK indices. Such a listing does not allow indexation, so UK tracker funds can\u2019t hold the shares. Perhaps more significantly many of the UK listing rules which govern corporate behaviour, such as shareholder approval for significant acquisitions, do not apply to a standard listing. There will still be a major flowback issue which has implications for the underlying price the shares are offered at. Basically, it\u2019s a fudge which is unattractive to UK shareholders\u2019 In a busy morning for takeover news, UK property group Hammerson is fending off an approach from French mall operator Kl\u00e9pierre. Kl\u00e9pierre has announced this morning that it approached Hammerson about a possible \u00a35bn offer. If it went through, it would thwart Hammerson\u2019s attempt to merge with rival Intu and create Britain\u2019s biggest property firm. Hammerson has swiftly rejected Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s approach as \u201centirely opportunistic\u201d and without merit, even though the 615p per share offer is around 40% over Hammerson\u2019s value last week. Hammerson shares have jumped 25% this morning, as traders anticipate a bidding battle for the company - which owns 37 shopping centres and retail parks including Birmingham\u2019s Bullring shopping centre. More here: Reuters reckons the takeover battle for GKN is heating up today, with both sides sweetening their pitch to shareholders. They write: Melrose, making a hostile bid, said it would inject about 1 billion pounds ($1.39 billion) into GKN\u2019s pension scheme, its latest attempt to convince shareholders to back its offer and win over political opponents of the deal. Shareholders have until March 29 to decide on that offer. GKN is trying to fight off the Melrose bid with an alternative $6.1 billion deal to merge its automotive business with U.S. company Dana Incorporated leaving GKN focused on its aerospace division. Dana said on Monday it would seek a secondary listing in London, enabling more UK shareholders to back the rival plan as some funds are subject to rules which prevent them from holding US stock. The US company also promised GKN investors a slice of its dividend as it said it would pay its current quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to the enlarged shareholder base. Bloomberg\u2019s Sam Unsted says it\u2019s turning into a full-blown saga: Over in the City, investors have been distracted from the GKN-Melrose battle by a truly grim announcement from tech firm Micro Focus. Micro Focus, a FTSE 100-listed software provider, warned that revenues will fall by between 6% and 9% this year, which will eat into profits. It blames integration problems following its \u00a36.8bn takeover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s software business last autumn, a deal that made Micro Focus Britain\u2019s biggest tech company. Micro Focus admits that it has struggled to implement its new IT system, which hit sales - leading to sales people quitting the business. Splitting HP\u2019s software operations from the rest of the business has caused further disruption to customer accounts, it admits, making it harder to win sales. Quite a mess. CEO Chris Hsu has resigned and is leaving with immediate effect to \u201cspend more time with his family and pursue another opportunity\u201d. Micro Focus insists it can fix these problems, and that the HP deal makes sense. But shareholders have reacted by wiping 50% off Micro Focus\u2019s share price. The unions who represent GKN employees across the UK will demand answers from Melrose over its plans for the company, when they meet today. Many GKN workers fear for their future, as Melrose\u2019s business model is to buy companies, make them more profitable, and then sell them again. One person\u2019s \u2018asset-stripper\u2019 is another one\u2019s \u2018turnaround specialist\u2019, of course. But unions are concerned that Melrose could load GKN up with debt, and take a dangerously short-term approach. Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary Steve Turner has warned: \u201cMelrose\u2019s bosses have been far from clear about the detail of their true intentions for GKN beyond vague platitudes and soundbites. \u201cQuestion marks remain around the levels of debt Melrose will pile on the company and what it means for jobs, long-term investment and product development. Turner also points out that aerospace giant Airbus - GKN\u2019s largest customer - has warned it couldn\u2019t work with the firm unless it knew its long-term plans. \u201cGKN\u2019s highly skilled UK workforce fear they will end up being sold off piecemeal, with their jobs either axed or shipped overseas to fund a debt-fuelled pay day if Melrose gets its way. That concern over Melrose\u2019s short-termism extends to major GKN customers such as Airbus too, which relies on a long-term relationship with GKN to develop the wings of the future. \u201cIf Airbus or other major customers take their business elsewhere it would blow a hole in revenues and destroy jobs and innovation. In another development, Melrose has lowered the \u2018Acceptance Condition\u2019 of its GKN offer, from 90% to 50% plus one share. That means it has lowered the bar to a successful takeover. GKN has hit back against Melrose\u2019s takeover bid. The UK engineering group has announced that, once it sells its Driveline business to American firm Dana, the resulting company will have a secondary listing on the London stock exchange as well as a primary listing in New York. That is designed to help GKN investors, who might have been forced to sell the shares they\u2019ll own in Dana-GKN Driveline if the deal goes through Driveline is GKN\u2019s automobile division. The \u00a34.4bn sale to Dana (who make axels and driveshafts) was hammered out 10 days ago as GKN battled to repel Melrose\u2019s advances. CEO Anne Stevens says that the deal makes sense for GKN shareholders, especially if they\u2019ll be able to hold onto equity in the new business through a London listing. \u201cSince announcing the deal to bring GKN Driveline and Dana together, I have had the opportunity to speak to many of our shareholders and explain why I am so excited about this prospect. \u201cThe complementary nature of the two businesses and our shared commitment to R&amp;D and long term investment creates a fantastic opportunity to build a world leading company and create meaningful shareholder value by delivering $235 million in synergies. \u201cThe listing on the London Stock Exchange will make it possible for more of our shareholders to participate in the expected value creation opportunity from the combined Dana and GKN Driveline business.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The battle to take control of one of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering firms is hotting up today. Melrose, the turnaround group, has intensified the pressure as it tries to seize control of GKN, in an increasingly bitter fight. Over the weekend, Melrose CEO Simon Peckham blasted GKN\u2019s management, telling the Sunday Telegraph that: \u201cGKN has been run by people who don\u2019t have an owner mentality, they have a manager mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s a business that has slowly but surely lost the support of the UK institutional investment community.\u201d Relations between the two companies were already chilly (Melrose\u2019s plan for GKN includes dismissing its management and giving its staff more involvement). Peckham\u2019s intervention, at a time when major shareholders are having to choose who to back, ensures they are now sub-zero. And this morning, Melrose has announced that it has offered to put more money into GKN\u2019s pension scheme -- roughly \u00a31bn over the time it expected to own GKN. It told the City that this proposal is almost twice the amount of the \u00a3528 million deficit reduction package that the trustees recently agreed with GKN. Melrose chairman Christopher Miller says: The proposal we have made to the trustees of up to \u00a31 billion of contributions under our ownership is a clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders. Melrose\u2019s measured approach represents certainty of strategy, value and management. We strongly urge GKN shareholders to accept our offer without delay.\u201d That might assuage some concerns about whether Melrose is a suitable owner for GKN. GKN, though, insists that Melrose\u2019s latest offer (worth around \u00a38bn) is too low. MPs also have concerns, given Melrose\u2019s track record of buying companies and breaking them up to release value. Unions also fear job losses - and are expect to meet with Melrose today. Shareholders have until 29th March to make a decision.... Also coming up today.... Finance ministers from the G20 group of advanced economies are meeting in Argentina today. They\u2019ll be discussing trade, financial stability and cryptocurrencies (among other issues). The economic calendar heats up later this week, with UK inflation and unemployment data, plus interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. However, today is quieter, apart from some eurozone trade and construction data. The agenda: 10am GMT: Eurozone trade balance for January 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output figures for January All day: G20 finance ministers meet in Buenos Aires",

coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong><br></p> \n  <p>The battle to take control of one of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering firms is hotting up today.</p> \n  <p>Melrose, the turnaround group, has intensified the pressure as it tries to seize control of GKN, in an increasingly bitter fight.</p> \n  <p>Over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/03/17/melrose-chief-launches-attack-gkn-bosses-losing-citys-confidence/\">Melrose CEO Simon Peckham blasted GKN\u2019s management, telling the Sunday Telegraph that</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cGKN has been run by people who don\u2019t have an owner mentality, they have a manager mentality.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a business that has slowly but surely lost the support of the UK institutional investment community.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Relations between the two companies were already chilly (Melrose\u2019s plan for GKN includes dismissing its management and giving its staff more involvement). Peckham\u2019s intervention, at a time when major shareholders are having to choose who to back, ensures they are now sub-zero.</p> \n  <p><strong>And this morning, Melrose has announced that it has offered to put more money into GKN\u2019s pension scheme -- roughly \u00a31bn over the time it expected to own GKN.</strong></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.investegate.co.uk/melrose-industries--mro-/rns/statement-re-final-offer-for-gkn-plc/201803190700060707I/\">It told the City</a> that this proposal is almost twice the amount of the \u00a3528 million deficit reduction package that the trustees recently agreed with GKN.</p> \n  <p>Melrose chairman <strong>Christopher Miller </strong>says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The proposal we have made to the trustees of up to \u00a31 billion of contributions under our ownership is a clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders.</p> \n   <p>Melrose\u2019s measured approach represents certainty of strategy, value and management. We strongly urge GKN shareholders to accept our offer without delay.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That might assuage some concerns about whether Melrose is a suitable owner for GKN.</p> \n  <p>GKN, though, insists that Melrose\u2019s latest offer (worth around \u00a38bn) is too low. MPs also have concerns, given Melrose\u2019s track record of buying companies and breaking them up to release value.</p> \n  <p>Unions also fear job losses - and are expect to meet with Melrose today.</p> \n  <p>Shareholders have until 29th March to make a decision....</p> \n  <h2>Also coming up today....</h2> \n  <p>Finance ministers from the G20 group of advanced economies are meeting in Argentina today. They\u2019ll be discussing trade, financial stability and cryptocurrencies (among other issues).</p> \n  <p>The economic calendar heats up later this week, with UK inflation and unemployment data, plus interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve.

      "bodyText": "Get ready for some sport at Barclays. Edward Bramson, an activist investor out of New York with a taste for barging into boardrooms and metaphorically smashing up the crockery, has unveiled a 5% stake in the bank. Previous UK targets have included F&amp;C Asset Management, Electra Private Equity and 3i, so Barclays represents a major step-up in ambition. It\u2019s one thing to make a splash in the lower leagues of London financial firms, but another to try to call the shots at a highly regulated high street lender. But that is not a reason to think Bramson will divert from his usual practice of making specific strategic demands and never taking a backwards step. Jes Staley, Barclays\u2019 \u00a34m-a-year chief executive (yes, despite a share price that has gone roughly nowhere on his watch) may find Bramson to be a major irritation. His new activist shareholder is richer than him and has never been accused of being excessively charming. What does Bramson want? A higher share price, obviously. How does he think it should be achieved? His Sherborne fund is in its usual non-communicative mode at this early stage, so it\u2019s impossible to know. But the investment bank could be on the radar. The division consumes two-thirds of Barclays\u2019 capital but has produced sub-par returns for years. Demerge it? Sell it? Give it less capital? All those ideas would put Bramson on a collision course with a Staley regime that is committed to investment banking and thinks its strategy will come good within two years. The Staley philosophy says you can\u2019t be half-hearted. His predecessor, Anthony Jenkins, tried running a pared-down investment bank and the experiment was deemed a flop. Bramson\u2019s view could be fascinating. Does he, for example, think Barclays is better at generating bonuses for its top bankers than it is at making money for the shareholders? If so, bring on the debate \u2013 Staley\u2019s \u201ctrust me\u201d approach on investment banking has had a ridiculously easy ride so far. Optimistic, but out of focus Micro Focus\u2019s share price hit \u00a322 on the day in September 2016 that the UK\u2019s largest quoted technology company unveiled its bold $8.8bn (\u00a36.3bn) purchase of Hewlett Packard\u2019s unwanted software division, including parts of the old Autonomy business. Now the shares are \u00a310.11, down by almost a half on Monday as executive chairman Kevin Loosemore was obliged to concede that a deal that trebled Micro Focus\u2019s size was a huge mistake. Actually, Loosemore did no such thing. Instead, Micro Focus argued that the \u201cfundamental thesis\u201d of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) acquisition \u201cremains intact\u201d. It is merely \u201coperational issues\u201d that have led to a \u201cdisappointing\u201d short-term performance, including a miss on revenues that were supposedly fine in January. Top marks for optimism. But, come on, when the list of things that have gone wrong is so long, the distinction between a bad deal and bad execution is semantic. Micro Focus cited: \u201cissues\u201d with integrating the two IT systems, under-powered sales teams, poor cash collection and general disruption in separating HPE. One could shrug and say upsets happen in the world of cutting-edge technology. But that\u2019s not Micro Focus\u2019s market. The company operates in the dull, and supposedly lower-risk, field of rewiring legacy software systems with the minimum of fuss. But after only six months \u2013 the HSE deal completed in September last year \u2013 it has parted company with Chris Hsu, the chief executive who arrived with the new business. The plunge in the share price removed almost \u00a34bn from Micro Focus\u2019s stock market value. The reaction was severe, but so is the credibility deficit at a company that had previously prospered on a diet of much smaller acquisitions. Micro Focus shelled out $2.5bn in cash and doubled the number of shares in issue to the HPE deal. If you bet the farm, have a bullet-proof plan for integration. Why it helps to be nice to your shareholders It\u2019s a bit rich for David Tyler, chairman of Hammerson, to grumble that a \u00a34.9bn bid approach from French shopping centre group Kl\u00e9pierre is \u201copportunistic\u201d. Tyler and Hammerson created the opportunity themselves by negotiating an all-share deal their own shareholders clearly hate \u2013 the planned \u00a33bn merger with smaller UK rival Intu. Hammerson\u2019s shares had fallen 18% since announcement of the Intu deal, which is in effect a doubling down on exposure to UK shopping centres, an asset class deeply out of fashion in the age of internet shopping. Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s initial pitch \u2013 a 615p offer only half in cash \u2013 is probably too low to succeed. But the French have given Hammerson\u2019s board a clue on how to proceed: listen to your shareholders.",

      "body": "<p>Get ready for some sport at Barclays. Edward Bramson, an activist investor out of New York with a taste for barging into boardrooms and metaphorically smashing up the crockery, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/19/activist-investor-plans-shake-up-at-barclays-after-building-5-share\">has unveiled a 5% stake in the bank</a>.</p> <p>Previous UK targets have included F&amp;C Asset Management, Electra Private Equity and 3i, so Barclays represents a major step-up in ambition. It\u2019s one thing to make a splash in the lower leagues of London financial firms, but another to try to call the shots at a highly regulated high street lender.</p> <p>But that is not a reason to think Bramson will divert from his usual practice of making specific strategic demands and never taking a backwards step. Jes Staley, Barclays\u2019 \u00a34m-a-year chief executive (yes, despite a share price that has gone roughly nowhere on his watch) may find Bramson to be a major irritation. His new activist shareholder is richer than him and has never been accused of being excessively charming.</p> <p>What does Bramson want? A higher share price, obviously. How does he think it should be achieved? His Sherborne fund is in its usual non-communicative mode at this early stage, so it\u2019s impossible to know. But the investment bank could be on the radar. The division consumes two-thirds of Barclays\u2019 capital but has produced sub-par returns for years.</p> <p>Demerge it? Sell it? Give it less capital? All those ideas would put Bramson on a collision course with a Staley regime that is committed to investment banking and thinks its strategy will come good within two years. The Staley philosophy says you can\u2019t be half-hearted. His predecessor, Anthony Jenkins, tried running a pared-down investment bank and the experiment was deemed a flop.</p> <p>Bramson\u2019s view could be fascinating. Does he, for example, think Barclays is better at generating bonuses for its top bankers than it is at making money for the shareholders? If so, bring on the debate \u2013 Staley\u2019s \u201ctrust me\u201d approach on investment banking has had a ridiculously easy ride so far.</p> <h2>Optimistic, but out of focus</h2> <p>Micro Focus\u2019s share price hit \u00a322 on the day in September 2016 that the UK\u2019s largest quoted technology company unveiled its bold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/08/uk-micro-focus-hewlett-packard-software-deal\">$8.8bn (\u00a36.3bn) purchase of Hewlett Packard\u2019s unwanted software division</a>, including parts of the old Autonomy business. Now the shares are \u00a310.11, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/19/micro-focus-ceo-departure-plunges-shares-by-56-per-cent\">down by almost a half on Monday</a> as executive chairman Kevin Loosemore was obliged to concede that a deal that trebled Micro Focus\u2019s size was a huge mistake.</p> <p>Actually, Loosemore did no such thing. Instead, Micro Focus argued that the \u201cfundamental thesis\u201d of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) acquisition \u201cremains intact\u201d. It is merely \u201coperational issues\u201d that have led to a \u201cdisappointing\u201d short-term performance, including a miss on revenues that were supposedly fine in January.</p> <p>Top marks for optimism. But, come on, when the list of things that have gone wrong is so long, the distinction between a bad deal and bad execution is semantic. Micro Focus cited: \u201cissues\u201d with integrating the two IT systems, under-powered sales teams, poor cash collection and general disruption in separating HPE.</p> <p>One could shrug and say upsets happen in the world of cutting-edge technology. But that\u2019s not Micro Focus\u2019s market. The company operates in the dull, and supposedly lower-risk, field of rewiring legacy software systems with the minimum of fuss. But after only six months \u2013 the HSE deal completed in September last year \u2013 it has parted company with Chris Hsu, the chief executive who arrived with the new business.</p> <p>The plunge in the share price removed almost \u00a34bn from Micro Focus\u2019s stock market value. The reaction was severe, but so is the credibility deficit at a company that had previously prospered on a diet of much smaller acquisitions. Micro Focus shelled out $2.5bn in cash and doubled the number of shares in issue to the HPE deal. If you bet the farm, have a bullet-proof plan for integration. </p> <h2>Why it helps to be nice to your shareholders</h2> <p>It\u2019s a bit rich for David Tyler, chairman of Hammerson, to grumble that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/19/french-firm-makes-49bn-offer-to-hammerson-over-intu-acquisition\">a \u00a34.9bn bid approach from French shopping centre group Kl\u00e9pierre</a> is \u201copportunistic\u201d. Tyler and Hammerson created the opportunity themselves by negotiating an all-share deal their own shareholders clearly hate \u2013 the planned \u00a33bn merger with smaller UK rival Intu.</p> <p>Hammerson\u2019s shares had fallen 18% since announcement of the Intu deal, which is in effect a doubling down on exposure to UK shopping centres, an asset class deeply out of fashion in the age of internet shopping. Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s initial pitch \u2013 a 615p offer only half in cash \u2013 is probably too low to succeed. But the French have given Hammerson\u2019s board a clue on how to proceed: listen to your shareholders.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A \u201cfull and frank\u201d meeting between trade union officials and the company mounting an \u00a38bn hostile takeover for GKN broke up in acrimony on Monday amid accusations that the would-be buyer would not give assurances on future investment. Unite said it had no confidence in bidder Melrose following the meeting, the first time the two sides had got around the table since the controversial hostile bid for GKN was unveiled in January. Tony Burke, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, said Melrose had refused \u201cto offer concrete guarantees on jobs and skills\u201d and accused the company of having \u201cno clear long-term strategy to drive growth and innovation\u201d. Unite has been critical of Melrose\u2019s bid for GKN, arguing that the company\u2019s track record of seeking to restructure companies that it acquires and sell them on after three to five years mean that it was not a suitable long-term owner. However, the fate of the bid remains finely balanced, with City investors backing both sides. On Monday a top 10 investor in GKN, Columbia Threadneedle, said it was backing the engineering group against Melrose \u2013 although another investor Aviva has previously come out supporting Melrose. GKN has been forced to propose merging its car parts business with US company Dana in an alternative $6.1bn (\u00a34.4bn) deal, leaving the industrial giant focused on its aerospace division, which supplies components for Franco-German aerospace group Airbus. Melrose said on Monday it would put extra funds into GKN\u2019s pension scheme, saying it would start with \u00a3150m in cash plus a further \u00a360m over five years, taking the total it would plough in to \u00a3450m. Further contributions on future disposals, Melrose said, would take the figure to about \u00a31bn. Christopher Miller, chairman of Melrose, said the pensions proposal was \u201ca clear example of what Melrose does which is good for pensioners and shareholders alike and shows we are a good custodian for all stakeholders\u201d. Melrose sources added that the company typically invests 4% of sales in research and development, higher than the 2.2% historically invested by GKN, and argued that asset stripping would make no sense if the goal was to sell on restructured businesses to other industrial buyers at a higher price. Last week Airbus, GKN\u2019s biggest customer, said it could not guarantee new work to an owner with a short-term perspective, a point also highlighted by Unite following the Melrose meeting. Steve Turner, a Unite assistant general secretary, added: \u201cThe short-term, profit-driven nature of Melrose\u2019s bid is leading to rising anger and instability amongst GKN\u2019s workforce, as well as concerns with major customers, such as Airbus.\u201d Meanwhile, Dana said on Monday it would seek a secondary listing in London, a move which should enable more UK shareholders to back the rival plan as some funds are subject to rules which prevent them from holding US stock. Dana also tried to give GKN shareholders extra confidence in the future of the merged car parts unit. It also upgraded its margin and sales guidance, saying it had \u201cover-achieved\u201d on synergies from past acquisitions. GKN shares closed down 2.7p at 424.2p. Melrose\u2019s offer of 81p in cash for each GKN share plus 1.69 new Melrose shares was worth 457p a share at the close of business; a transaction that would hand GKN investors a 60% stake in the London-listed turnaround specialist.",

      "bodyText": "An activist investor has built up a 5% stake in Barclays in an attempt to shake up the bank\u2019s strategy and boost its share price. Barclays announced on Monday that Ed Bramson\u2019s Sherborne Investors had \u201cacquired voting rights over 5.16% of Barclays\u2019 issued share capital\u201d. The stakebuilding by Sherborne, which describes itself as a \u201cturnaround investment firm\u201d, makes it Barclays\u2019 fourth-biggest investor after US asset managers Capital Group and BlackRock, and Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Bramson, who was born in the UK but moved to New York in 1975, did not comment on his intentions at Barclays but he has often been described as a \u201ccorporate raider\u201d who forces change at companies he invests in. Barclays, whose investment banking division is lagging US rivals, said some of its board members have already met with Bramson and the bank \u201cwill continue to engage with Sherborne, and welcomes them as a shareholder\u201d. Shares in Barclays rose 3.6% to 217p. Barclays, which last month reported a \u00a31.9bn full-year loss, was one of the worst performing banks in the world last year, with shares falling 12%. Sherborne, a two-man firm run by Bramson and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Stephen Welker, owns 1.94% of Barclays voting rights directly via shares and another 3.2% controlled indirectly via derivative contracts. The fund raised \u00a3700m last summer to fund its next target. The prospectus for the fundraising said Sherborne planned to invest in a \u201ccompany which it considers to be undervalued as a result of operational deficiencies and which it believes can be rectified by the Investment Manager\u2019s active involvement\u201d. Unlike high-profile activist investors such as Bill Ackman or Carl Ichan, Bramson prefers to avoid publicity. He has previously targeted well-known British companies including fund manager F&amp;C Asset Management and private equity groups Electra and 3i. Bramson is due to step down as interim chief executive of Electra, which owns TGI Fridays, later this month after fighting his way on to the firm\u2019s board in 2015. He slashed costs at Electra and encouraged the company to start paying big dividends to shareholders. Sherborne is the private equity firm\u2019s biggest shareholder, with a 30% stake. In a newspaper interview in 2015, Bramson said the rest of Electra\u2019s board \u201cthink we\u2019re scum\u201d. He also went head-to-head against Edward Bonham-Carter, the vice-chairman of investment house Jupiter and older brother of Hollywood star Helena Bonham-Carter. Jupiter was a big investor in Electra and rejected Bramson\u2019s bid for control. Bramson has said he quit the UK for the US in 1975 after getting trapped in a lift during the power cuts that crippled Britain in the early 1970s. He now operates out of offices on the top floor of a 32-storey tower block in midtown Manhattan with views of the Chrysler building and the East River. He has rarely spoken about his private life, but divulged in a Bloomberg interview in 2015 that he did go through \u201ca toy phase\u201d. \u201cI did like the houses, all that crap,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Micro Focus crashed after the software firm warned sales were falling faster than expected and said that its chief executive had departed after just months in the job. The FTSE 100 company lost nearly half its market value by the close of trading on Monday, with the shares down 46% to \u00a310.11. The firm, which has grown out of a series of acquisitions, said its chief executive, Chris Hsu, had stepped down and been replaced by the chief operating officer, Stephen Murdoch. Hsu, who previously ran Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s software division, took the helm at Micro Focus after it completed the \u00a36.6bn acquisition of the business in September to create one of the world\u2019s leading software companies. It is understood he is not getting a payoff and does not have another job lined up. Micro Focus warned its year-on-year revenue decline had been worse than expected since early January. It is now expecting sales to fall between 6% and 9% in the year to 31 October, compared with 2% to 4% previously. Performance is forecast to be even worse in its first half to 30 April, with the firm expecting a sales drop of 9% to 12%. The Berkshire-based firm blamed problems with the integration of the HPE Software business last year, which had led to lower-than-expected licence income, issues related to its new IT system and the loss of sales staff. It plans to hire 50 to 60 more salespeople. HPE Software includes assets from Hewlett Packard\u2019s 2011 purchase of the UK software firm Autonomy. The acquisition was the biggest Micro Focus had ever made and involved the firm taking control of a business bigger than itself. It insisted the problems were operational and could be fixed. Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u201cMicro Focus\u2019s deal to buy HPE\u2019s software business was huge and very complicated, not least because both firms had already done a lot of deals. \u201cInvestors need to be wary of firms which make multiple acquisitions, especially if they are big and seen, or described, as transformational as the scope for something going wrong is considerable \u2013 as shareholders in Marconi, Royal Bank of Scotland or more recently Carillion will attest.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The ALP\u2019s policy to end the cash rebate of dividend imputation has brought out the usual pre-budget argument over who is rich a bit earlier than usual. But the debate has also very nicely brought attention to the importance of wealth holdings. This is vital because as people enter retirement they can be quite income poor (and very much taxable-income poor) but have very large holdings of wealth. It is no surprise that the issue of franking credits has focused on retirees, because overwhelmingly they are the ones who receive them. According to the latest ATO statistics, while 65-74 year olds accounted for just 7% of all individuals with an income, they accounted for 17% of individuals claiming franking credits and for 20% of the total value of those credits. The disparity for those aged over 75 is even greater. Such people accounted for 3% of all income earning individuals, but 22% of the value of all franking credits. When we look at those aged over 65 who claim dividend franking credits, overwhelmingly they are claimed by those with taxable incomes under $37,000, but the vast amount of dollar value of the credit goes to those with a taxable income above $180,000. While just 3% of those aged over 65 had a taxable income above $180,000, they claimed 43% of the value of dividend franking credits. Their average credit was $60,697 compared to the average of $767 claimed by those with a taxable income below the tax free threshold: But that a plurality of those over 65 who claim franking credits are below the tax free-threshold does pose some problems for the ALP. Clearly they will be among those negatively affected by the policy. But the relatively small average figures involved mean the overall revenue savings from the policy should easily cover any need to compensate pensioners. And it is always worth remembering that these figures relate to \u201ctaxable\u201d income \u2013 which can be greatly different from total income. In 2014-15, for example, 468 individuals with a total income above $180,000 but with a taxable income below the tax-free threshold claimed a total of $9.5m in dividend franking credits. And thus we always need to be mindful of the difference between taxable income and total income, given the whole point of taxation minimisation such as negative gearing is to get your taxable income down as low as possible in order to claim the credits. We also need to be aware of just what is a wealthy household. The latest household income and wealth figures released by the ABS last year showed that the median annual disposable income (ie after tax) in 2015-16 for a single person was $44,356 \u2013 or around $52,900 before tax For a household of two adults and two children under 15, the median was $93,148. That works out using a 70/30 income split of a household with one adult earning around $84,700 before tax while the other earns $29,800: But the debate over dividend imputation has very rightly highlighted that older people generally earn less. Thankfully the ABS also gives us the figures for households by age of the head of the household. While the median equivalised disposable income for a household with the head aged 45-54 is $47,840, for one aged 65-74, it is just $35,672: To give some context for the talk about which retirees are rich and which are not, the aged pension plus energy supplement is worth $23,254 a year \u2013 which would put such a person in the second lowest income decile for people aged 65-74. Now of course income is not the only factor at play \u2013 especially for retirees. A couple with a disposable income of $53,508 might be right on the median income for those aged 65-74, but there is a big different between such a couple who are renting, and a couple with the same income who have paid off their home. This is where wealth comes into play. While retiree aged households have lower incomes, they have a great deal more wealth, because you accumulate wealth over your lifetime: A big reason for that wealth is property and superannuation. The richest 20% of households hold an average of $1.2m in property \u2013 2.5 times the level held by households in the median income quintile. The richest 20% also hold 2.8 times the level of superannuation that is held by median households: And while we like to get excited about growing income inequality, over the past decade, wealth inequality has grown by much more: It is why housing affordability is such a crucial issue. Not because buying a house might be preferable to renting, but because it generates wealth holdings that become vital in retirement. While those who rent do have a lower median income than those who either own their home outright or are still paying off a mortgage, the difference between wealth holdings of renters and home owners is massive: It makes for a complex picture and one that demands we watch out for sloppy reporting and lazy talk by politicians of those being \u201chit\u201d by Labor\u2019s policy. Those who have a low taxable income might have a disposable income that is actually relatively high, and it can tell us little about their level of wealth holdings let alone whether or not they are actually struggling.",

Such people accounted for 3% of all income earning individuals, but 22% of the value of all franking credits. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Share of the dividend franking credits by age (2014-15)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pUI0e/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When we look at those aged over 65 who claim dividend franking credits, overwhelmingly they are claimed by those with taxable incomes under $37,000, but the vast amount of dollar value of the credit goes to those with a taxable income above $180,000.</p> <p>While just 3% of those aged over 65 had a taxable income above $180,000, they claimed 43% of the value of dividend franking credits. Their average credit was $60,697 compared to the average of $767 claimed by those with a taxable income below the tax free threshold:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Share of the dividend franking credits by those aged 65+ by taxable income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/s1U4p/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But that a plurality of those over 65 who claim franking credits are below the tax free-threshold does pose some problems for the ALP. Clearly they will be among those negatively affected by the policy. But the relatively small average figures involved mean the overall revenue savings from the policy should easily cover any need to compensate pensioners. </p> <p>And it is always worth remembering that these figures relate to \u201ctaxable\u201d income \u2013 which can be greatly different from total income. </p> <p>In 2014-15, for example, 468 individuals with a total income above $180,000 but with a taxable income below the tax-free threshold claimed a total of $9.5m in dividend franking credits. </p> <p>And thus we always need to be mindful of the difference between taxable income and total income, given the whole point of taxation minimisation such as negative gearing is to get your taxable income down as low as possible in order to claim the credits. </p> <p>We also need to be aware of just what is a wealthy household. </p> <p>The latest household income and wealth figures released by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/sep/13/new-abs-data-proves-it-scares-about-growing-welfare-dependency-are-rubbish\">the ABS last year</a> showed that the median annual disposable income (ie after tax) in 2015-16 for a single person was $44,356 \u2013 or around $52,900 before tax</p> <p>For a household of two adults and two children under 15, the median was $93,148. That works out using a 70/30 income split of a household with one adult earning around $84,700 before tax while the other earns $29,800:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Equivalised household disposable income by income decile and household type 2015-16\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SBCTM/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the debate over dividend imputation has very rightly highlighted that older people generally earn less. Thankfully the ABS also gives us the figures for households by age of the head of the household. While the median equivalised disposable income for a household with the head aged 45-54 is $47,840, for one aged 65-74, it is just $35,672:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Equivalised household disposable income by age (2015-16)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SYMhf/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>To give some context for the talk about which retirees are rich and which are not, the <a href=\"https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/enablers/payment-rates-age-pension\">aged pension plus energy supplement</a> is worth $23,254 a year \u2013 which would put such a person in the second lowest income decile for people aged 65-74. </p> <p>Now of course income is not the only factor at play \u2013 especially for retirees. A couple with a disposable income of $53,508 might be right on the median income for those aged 65-74, but there is a big different between such a couple who are renting, and a couple with the same income who have paid off their home.</p> <p>This is where wealth comes into play.</p> <p>While retiree aged households have lower incomes, they have a great deal more wealth, because you accumulate wealth over your lifetime: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Median household disposable income &amp; wealth 2014-15 by age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/S0D3C/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A big reason for that wealth is property and superannuation. The richest 20% of households hold an average of $1.2m in property \u2013 2.5 times the level held by households in the median income quintile. </p> <p>The richest 20% also hold 2.8 times the level of superannuation that is held by median households:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Value of assets by equivalised household income quintiles\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TfIwo/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And while we like to get excited about growing income inequality, over the past decade, wealth inequality has grown by much more:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"10 year growth of income and wealth by household percentile\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yycSp/4/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It is why housing affordability is such a crucial issue. Not because buying a house might be preferable to renting, but because it generates wealth holdings that become vital in retirement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/14/factchecking-coalition-claims-is-labor-going-after-mum-and-dads-savings\">Factchecking Coalition claims: is Labor going after Mum and Dad's savings? | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While those who rent do have a lower median income than those who either own their home outright or are still paying off a mortgage, the difference between wealth holdings of renters and home owners is massive: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Income and wealth of households by tenure status\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sCcvA/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It makes for a complex picture and one that demands we watch out for sloppy reporting and lazy talk by politicians of those being \u201chit\u201d by Labor\u2019s policy.

Claire\u2019s, the chainstore known for its tween jewelry and ear piercing, declared bankruptcy on Monday, the latest retailer to succumb to the online shopping revolution. Claire\u2019s made the move as it announced it was looking to restructure $1.9bn in debts it built up after being taken over by Apollo Global Management in 2007. The company has struggled as mall traffic has declined and becomes the latest mall fixture to declare bankruptcy following Toys R Us and Sports Authority.

It is not clear how many of those closures, if any, might be in the UK. Like Toys R Us, Claire\u2019s was taken over by venture capital companies and saddled with huge debts. Those debts cost it $183m a year in interest payments alone.

      "bodyText": "The housebuilder Persimmon paid its chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, and two other executives a combined \u00a3104m last year. The news follows a political and shareholder backlash against pay at the top of the FTSE 100 company, which prompted it to slash bonus payouts to the three executives by more than \u00a350m in February. However, the first tranche of the bonus payouts was unaffected by the reduction. This meant Fairburn received a total pay and shares packet of \u00a347.1m in 2017, up from \u00a32.1m the year before, Persimmon\u2019s annual report showed. Dave Jenkinson, the managing director, was paid \u00a320.4m, up from \u00a31.4m in 2016, while Mike Killoran, the finance director, got \u00a336.7m, also up from \u00a31.4m. Each of them received big payouts under Persimmon\u2019s long-term incentive plan (LTIP), but their annual salaries and fees, benefits, cash bonuses and pension benefits also went up. Further bonus payouts under the LTIP scheme are due this summer. However, Persimmon said no board member would receive a salary increase for 2018 and the three executives will not get an annual bonus. It will be distributed to staff instead. Fairburn saw his annual salary rise to \u00a3675,270 from \u00a3647,747 last year. His benefits rose to \u00a342,800, his annual bonus hit \u00a31.29m and the value of his pension benefits and salary supplement reached \u00a3162,065. His bonus payout under the long-term share scheme was \u00a344.9m. Jenkinson\u2019s LTIP payout amounted to \u00a318.9m on top of a salary of \u00a3511,625 and an annual bonus of \u00a3739,437. Killoran received an LTIP payout of \u00a335.2m on top of his \u00a3511,775 salary, a cash bonus of \u00a3734,807, benefits and pension benefits. There were no LTIP payouts in 2016. The three executives are due to receive more bumper payouts this summer. Fairburn was originally in line for a total \u00a3110m payout under the LTIP scheme, which is believed to be Britain\u2019s most generous bonus payout. The company partially backed down last month. It said Fairburn and Killoran had decided to waive half of the second instalment of their bonuses and extend the length of time they are required to hold the shares to 2021. This means Fairburn could get about \u00a332m in the summer while Killoran and Jenkinson, who also took a cut to his bonus, are in line for \u00a319m. All three will have future payouts under the scheme capped at \u00a329 a share, compared with \u00a325.51 now. Persimmon came under intense pressure from politicians and investors for planning the record-breaking bonus payouts after the housebuilder benefitted from the taxpayer-backed help-to-buy scheme, which has boosted profits and its share price. Some shareholders indicated they would oppose the re-election of some directors at Persimmon\u2019s annual meeting on 25 April. Fairburn said last month he decided some time ago to give some of his bonus away, but he wanted to keep the decision private. Persimmon\u2019s chairman and the head of its remuneration committee resigned last year after admitting that the bonus scheme was poorly designed because it had not been capped. Last week the firm appointed Roger Devlin as chairman from 1 June. He has also been named chairman of William Hill.",

The Insolvency Service is already investigating the conduct of directors employed at the point at which the outsourcing giant collapsed, but \u201calso of any individuals who were previously directors\u201d, following a request from the business secretary, Greg Clark.

      "bodyText": "French mall operator Kl\u00e9pierre has approached Hammerson with a \u00a34.9bn bid proposal in an attempt to break up the UK property firm\u2019s agreed acquisition of Intu. Hammerson shares jumped 24% to 542.4p on news of the proposal, which values the business at 615p a share. Kl\u00e9pierre is trying to thwart Hammerson\u2019s \u00a33.4bn tie-up with Intu that would create Britain\u2019s biggest property company worth \u00a321bn. The deal, announced in December, would bring together Hammerson\u2019s Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham and Brent Cross in London with Intu\u2019s Trafford centre in Manchester. Kl\u00e9pierre said the bid was rejected in less than 24 hours on 9 March by a brief letter from David Tyler, Hammerson\u2019s chairman, to Jean-Marc Jestin, Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s chairman. A source close to Kl\u00e9pierre said it would prefer a constructive dialogue, but was not ruling anything out. Tyler described the proposal from Kl\u00e9pierre as \u201cwholly inadequate and entirely opportunistic\u201d. He said in a statement: \u201cIt is a calculated attempt to exploit the disconnect between our recent share price performance and the inherent value of our unique and irreplaceable portfolio which is delivering record results. \u201cKl\u00e9pierre is asking our shareholders to accept a price for their Hammerson shares which is not only at a significant discount to their book value but includes a large element of paper in a company which in our view has a lower quality portfolio and lower growth prospects.\u201d He said the Hammerson board \u201csees absolutely no merit in Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s proposal and has unanimously rejected it\u201d, and advised shareholders to take no action. Kl\u00e9pierre is one of Europe\u2019s biggest owner of shopping centres with a market value of \u20ac10.5bn (\u00a39.2bn). It owns more than 100 shopping centres in 16 countries serving close to 150 million customers, but does not have a presence in Britain. Hammerson owns or has stakes in 37 shopping centres and retail parks across the UK, Ireland and France. Its portfolio includes a large shopping centre in Marseille, Les Terrasses du Port. Analysts at Peel Hunt said: \u201cIronically, the response from Hammerson sets out the portfolio\u2019s unique properties \u2013 many of which we believe would be diluted by the Intu transaction. With the Hammerson shares up 27% this morning, the \u2018marriage of convenience\u2019 is now looking considerably less likely.\u201d Kl\u00e9pierre bought Dutch rival Corio three years ago which resulted in Simon Property Group, the largest US mall operator, becoming Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s biggest shareholder with a 20% holding. The North American firm has long harboured ambitions to enter the UK market and tried to take over Intu (then known as Capital Shopping Centres) in 2011, but walked away after its tie-up with John Whittaker\u2019s Peel Group. Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s move highlights the pressure mall operators are under, as the retail environment gets tougher and more consumers shop online. It means many retailers are closing stores and focusing on the most popular shopping centres, leaving other malls struggling. Last week Toys R Us said it would shut all 100 of its UK stores, with the loss of 3,000 jobs. After Hammerson announced its agreed tie-up with Intu, a bigger deal was unveiled. France\u2019s Unibail-Rodamco \u2013 Europe\u2019s biggest mall operator which owns Forum des Halles in Paris \u2013 said it would buy Westfield, the Australian company behind the UK\u2019s two highest-earning shopping centres in London. The \u00a319bn deal will create the world\u2019s biggest mall operator. Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, said: \u201cThe share price of the embattled shopping centre giant Hammerson has slumped since it announced its agreed bid for its UK rival Intu Properties, so the opportunistic 615p offer that French rival Kl\u00e9pierre has recently made for Hammerson is not quite as generous as it looks. \u201cBut, with many of its fashion and department store tenants in some trouble, Hammerson is going to have work hard now to convince its shareholders of the merits of the Intu deal.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "CBI urges UK to avoid loss of up to \u20ac1bn a year in EU research funding", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest business lobby group is seeking to prevent the loss of as much as \u20ac1bn (\u00a3882m) in annual European funding for scientific research and technological development, which has been thrown into doubt by Brexit. According to a briefing paper seen by the Guardian, the CBI is calling for the government to state its intention to renew its membership of the EU framework programme for research and development after Brexit. Failure to take such steps could further harm businesses already cutting their spending on research and discourage future investments, it says. \u201cThe government has taken good steps so far, but needs to go further,\u201d the document said, calling for Britain to become an \u201cassociate member\u201d of the framework programme to protect business investment in the country. The current European framework, due to be renewed in two years\u2019 time between EU member states and some other nations with associate status such as Turkey and Israel, has pumped about \u20ac3.9bn (\u00a33.44bn) into British research projects since 2014. Businesses get about \u20ac260m (\u00a3230m) of the funding a year, while the rest goes to universities and other research projects. Since the Brexit vote, British participation in EU framework projects has fallen in the rankings from second to Germany to fifth, amid heightened uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future as a member of the scheme, according to the CBI document. It said uncertainty is \u201ccausing businesses to reconsider R&amp;D investment, or move it to other countries\u201d, adding that this would \u201cset back prosperity and regional growth\u201d. The intervention by the influential lobby group comes after figures from the Office for National Statistics show the UK lagging behind its major European peers for spending on research and development. R&amp;D spending reached a record \u00a333.1bn in 2016, although the UK\u2019s spending was the same as 2015 as a proportion of GDP at 1.67% and it remained ranked 11th in the EU behind nations including France and Slovenia. The drop-off in spending could help to explain the slow recovery in the productivity levels of British workers since the financial crisis, which has acted to constrain wage growth and the performance of the economy. In response, the government has created an industrial strategy and promised to increase public spending on R&amp;D to the highest levels in four decades. The UK also this month issued a position paper on the renewal of the EU framework programme, saying it would \u201cactively engage in the development of the programme, including discussing possible options for our future participation\u201d. In a boost to investment, Siemens said it would build a \u00a327m state-of-the-art 3D-printing factory in Worcester, creating high-tech jobs in a sector the German engineering giant said would be vital to a successful post-Brexit Britain. The investment will allow Materials Solutions \u2013 in which Siemens bought an 85% stake in 2016 \u2013 to move to a bigger site in the city, creating 55 new jobs and taking the total workforce to 80. JuergenJ\u00fcrgen Maier, chief executive of Siemens UK, said the spending commitment was an example of Britain\u2019s industrial strategy \u201cin action\u201d, helping to foster innovation and drive productivity gains that will underpin the next industrial revolution. \u201cIf the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector is to grow and thrive, we must embrace digital technologies and build new industries based on them,\u201d Maier said. The call from the CBI also comes as figures show UK exporters are falling behind their European rivals, as the gradual increase in the value of the pound in recent months makes British goods less competitively priced for international buyers. Peter Hemington, partner at the accountancy firm BDO, said the UK was the weakest major EU country behind Germany, France, Italy and Spain, which all saw exports expand in the first three months of the year while the UK\u2019s fell back slightly.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s biggest business lobby group is seeking to prevent the loss of as much as \u20ac1bn (\u00a3882m) in annual European funding for scientific research and technological development, which has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/17/r-and-d-cant-fly-winds-austerity-research-development-brexit\">thrown into doubt by Brexit</a>. </p> <p>According to a briefing paper seen by the Guardian, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/cbi\">CBI</a> is calling for the government to state its intention to renew its membership of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/\">EU framework programme</a> for research and development after Brexit. Failure to take such steps could further harm businesses already cutting their spending on research and discourage future investments, it says.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe government has taken good steps so far, but needs to go further,\u201d the document said, calling for Britain to become an \u201cassociate member\u201d of the framework programme to protect business investment in the country.<br></p> <p>The current European framework, due to be renewed in two years\u2019 time between EU member states and some other nations with associate status such as Turkey and Israel, has pumped about \u20ac3.9bn (\u00a33.44bn) into British research projects since 2014. Businesses get about \u20ac260m (\u00a3230m) of the funding a year, while the rest goes to universities and other research projects.</p> <p>Since the Brexit vote, British participation in EU framework projects has fallen in the rankings from second to Germany to fifth, amid heightened uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future as a member of the scheme, according to the CBI document. It said uncertainty is \u201ccausing businesses to reconsider R&amp;D investment, or move it to other countries\u201d, adding that this would \u201cset back prosperity and regional growth\u201d.</p> <p>The intervention by the influential lobby group comes after <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/researchanddevelopmentexpenditure/bulletins/ukgrossdomesticexpenditureonresearchanddevelopment/2016\">figures from the Office for National Statistics</a> show the UK lagging behind its major European peers for spending on research and development. R&amp;D spending reached a record \u00a333.1bn in 2016, although the UK\u2019s spending was the same as 2015 as a proportion of GDP at 1.67% and it remained ranked 11th in the EU behind nations including France and Slovenia.</p> <p>The drop-off in spending could help to explain the slow recovery in the productivity levels of British workers since the financial crisis, which has acted to constrain wage growth and the performance of the economy. </p> <p>In response, the government has created an industrial strategy and promised to increase public spending on R&amp;D to the highest levels in four decades. The UK also this month issued a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/685997/FP9_position_paper.pdf\">position paper on the renewal of the EU framework programme</a>, saying it would \u201cactively engage in the development of the programme, including discussing possible options for our future participation\u201d.</p> <p>In a boost to investment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/siemens\">Siemens</a> said it would build a \u00a327m state-of-the-art 3D-printing factory in Worcester, creating high-tech jobs in a sector the German engineering giant said would be vital to a successful post-Brexit Britain. The investment will allow Materials Solutions \u2013 in which Siemens bought an 85% stake in 2016 \u2013 to move to a bigger site in the city, creating 55 new jobs and taking the total workforce to 80.</p> <p>JuergenJ\u00fcrgen Maier, chief executive of Siemens UK, said the spending commitment was an example of Britain\u2019s industrial strategy \u201cin action\u201d, helping to foster innovation and drive productivity gains that will underpin the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/fourth-industrial-revolution\">next industrial revolution</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector is to grow and thrive, we must embrace digital technologies and build new industries based on them,\u201d Maier said.</p> <p>The call from the CBI also comes as figures show UK exporters are falling behind their European rivals, as the gradual increase in the value of the pound in recent months makes British goods less competitively priced for international buyers.</p> <p>Peter Hemington, partner at the accountancy firm BDO, said the UK was the weakest major EU country behind Germany, France, Italy and Spain, which all saw exports expand in the first three months of the year while the UK\u2019s fell back slightly.</p> <p> <br></p>",
