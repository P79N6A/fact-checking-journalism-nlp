    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Pound hits two-year high against euro", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sterling climbed to its highest level against the euro in almost two years on Monday as concerns grew in the financial markets about the deepening crisis in the single currency. A pound at one stage bought more than \u20ac1.23 on the foreign exchanges \u2013 making foreign holidays cheaper but UK exports to the single-currency zone more expensive. Fears that \"austerity fatigue\" is setting in among voters were heightened after figures were released showing that Spain \u2013 the country thought to be next in line for a bailout \u2013 has slid back into recession. The pound was also stronger against the US dollar, where last week's weaker-than-expected growth figures for the first three months of 2012 were followed by a closely watched barometer of business in Chicago. Although figures last week showed the UK economy suffering from a double-dip recession, dealers are now anxious that the recovery in the world's biggest economy is losing momentum. City analysts said the rise in the value of the pound was not a vote of confidence in the UK but rather a vote of no confidence in the eurozone, where growth prospects are deemed to be worse than they are in Britain. Speculation that the Bank of England will be reluctant to expand its \u00a3325bn quantitative easing programme has also underpinned the pound over the past month, a period when pressure has mounted on bond markets in Spain and Italy. Valentin Marinov, currency analyst with CitiFX in New York, said the next few days could be crucial for the pound because the monthly Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) surveys starting on Tuesday of manufacturing, construction and services would be closely watched for evidence that last week's figures showing a 0.2% drop in gross domestic product in the first three months of the year gave a false picture of the true state of the economy. \"The reason for that is the fact that investors largely ignored the very disappointing quarter one GDP data released last week on the grounds that the PMIs were largely upbeat. Indications that the sentiment indicators declined more than expected in April could undermine to a degree market confidence that the UK growth figures will be revised significantly to the upside in coming weeks. In turn, renewed growth concerns could erode some of the interest rate advantage of sterling ahead of the regular Bank of England meeting and the release of the Bank's inflation report in the next couple of weeks.\" Dealers are looking to see whether the pound can break through \u20ac1.24 against the euro, a level it has not reached since 2008, the year the UK began its deepest recession since the second world war. Sterling lost 25% of its value during the financial and economic crisis of 2007-09, making exports more competitive but adding to upward pressure on the cost of living through more expensive imports. Further increases in sterling's exchange rate will make it harder for the government to achieve its aim of export-led growth, an objective that has already been put in jeopardy by the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone. The Spanish government on Monday said the economy contracted by 0.3% for a second successive quarter, while the authorities in Greece reported that retail sales in February were down 13% on a year earlier. Markets are also nervous about the results of the forthcoming Greek general election and the French presidential race. Kathleen Brooks, a director at currency trader Forex.com, said: \"The eurozone crisis is the key driver of why the euro has been weakening. The downtrack in the euro has been building up for a while. Things in the UK are not great, but in Europe they are worse.\"",

      "body": "<p>Sterling climbed to its highest level against the euro in almost two years on Monday as concerns grew in the financial markets about the deepening crisis in the single currency.</p> <p>A pound at one stage bought more than \u20ac1.23 on the foreign exchanges \u2013 making foreign holidays cheaper but UK exports to the single-currency zone more expensive.</p> <p>Fears that \"austerity fatigue\" is setting in among voters were heightened after figures were released showing that Spain \u2013 the country thought to be next in line for a bailout \u2013 has slid back into recession.</p> <p>The pound was also stronger against the US dollar, where last week's weaker-than-expected growth figures for the first three months of 2012 were followed by a closely watched barometer of business in Chicago. Although figures last week showed the UK economy suffering from a double-dip recession, dealers are now anxious that the recovery in the world's biggest economy is losing momentum.</p> <p>City analysts said the rise in the value of the pound was not a vote of confidence in the UK but rather a vote of no confidence in the eurozone, where growth prospects are deemed to be worse than they are in Britain. Speculation that the Bank of England will be reluctant to expand its \u00a3325bn quantitative easing programme has also underpinned the pound over the past month, a period when pressure has mounted on bond markets in Spain and Italy.</p> <p>Valentin Marinov, currency analyst with CitiFX in New York, said the next few days could be crucial for the pound because the monthly Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) surveys starting on Tuesday of manufacturing, construction and services would be closely watched for evidence that last week's figures showing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/25/uk-sinks-double-dip-recession-gdp\" title=\"\">0.2% drop in gross domestic product in the first three months of the year</a> gave a false picture of the true state of the economy.</p> <p>\"The reason for that is the fact that investors largely ignored the very disappointing quarter one GDP data released last week on the grounds that the PMIs were largely upbeat. Indications that the sentiment indicators declined more than expected in April could undermine to a degree market confidence that the UK growth figures will be revised significantly to the upside in coming weeks. In turn, renewed growth concerns could erode some of the interest rate advantage of sterling ahead of the regular Bank of England meeting and the release of the Bank's inflation report in the next couple of weeks.\"</p> <p>Dealers are looking to see whether the pound can break through \u20ac1.24 against the euro, a level it has not reached since 2008, the year the UK began its deepest recession since the second world war. Sterling lost 25% of its value during the financial and economic crisis of 2007-09, making exports more competitive but adding to upward pressure on the cost of living through more expensive imports.</p> <p>Further increases in sterling's exchange rate will make it harder for the government to achieve its aim of export-led growth, an objective that has already been put in jeopardy by the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone. The Spanish government on Monday said the economy contracted by 0.3% for a second successive quarter, while the authorities in Greece reported that retail sales in February were down 13% on a year earlier. Markets are also nervous about the results of the forthcoming Greek general election and the French presidential race.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, a director at currency trader Forex.com, said: \"The eurozone crisis is the key driver of why the euro has been weakening. The downtrack in the euro has been building up for a while. Things in the UK are not great, but in Europe they are worse.\"</p>",

The 30% pay deal that has been struck takes his basic salary to \u00a31.3m and comes with the potential to earn up to 500% of that in bonuses \u2013 an extra \u00a36.5m. Until now he could receive up to \u00a33m in bonuses \u2013 some 300% of his \u00a31m salary \u2013 and the company said the \"adjustment\" followed the \"share owner consultation process\". Some 60% of his 2011 bonus is being paid in deferred shares, up from 30% a year ago. He is also getting 45% of his salary paid into his pension, compared with 40% in the past. Last week WPP reported better-than-expected revenues for the first quarter, up 4% to \u00a32.4bn.",

      "bodyText": "Unemployment has risen in two-thirds of European countries since 2010 as austerity hit growth and jobs, the International Labour Organisation has said. In its annual world of work report, the Geneva-based ILO warned that the weaknesses in the labour market were becoming ingrained, with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment. The study found there were still 50 million fewer jobs in the global economy than before the recession began in 2008 and it was unlikely that growth would be strong enough in the next two years to find jobs for an extra 80 million people looking for work. Raymond Torres, director of the International Institute for Labour Studies and author of the report, said: \"This is not a normal employment slowdown. Four years into the global crisis, labour market imbalances are becoming more structural, and therefore more difficult to eradicate. Certain groups, such as the long-term unemployed, are at risk of exclusion from the labour market. This means they would be unable to obtain new employment even if there were a strong recovery.\" The ILO said the global employment rate in 2011 stood at 60.3% \u2013 0.9 percentage points lower than before the synchronised global downturn began four years ago. It added that youth unemployment had risen in 80% of advanced economies and in two-thirds of emerging market economies. Long-term unemployment was also on the rise, with one third of the jobless in the west out of work for more than a year. Even in countries where employment growth was on the rise, the ILO said jobs tended to be on a short-term basis, with increases in involuntary part-time employment and part-time temporary employment. Torres said: \"The trends are especially worrying in Europe, where the unemployment rate has increased in nearly two-thirds of these countries since 2010; but labour market recovery has also stalled in other advanced economies, such as Japan and the United States.
