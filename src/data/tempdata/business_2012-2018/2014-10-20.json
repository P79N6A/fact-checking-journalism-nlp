      "bodyText": "Late breaking news.... the Bank of England has just issued a statement, apologising for \u201cany problems\u201d caused by today\u2019s technical crash. It also confirmed that every payment submitted to its Real-Time Gross Settlements (RTGS) system has been processed, thanks to the four-hour extension put in place. Here\u2019s the full statement from Threadneedle Street: Bank of England statement \u2013 update on RTGS RTGS closed at 20:00 hrs (BST). All 142,759 payments submitted to RTGS today before the extended deadline have now been processed. The Bank has put in place extra steps to monitor the system at the start of the day tomorrow when RTGS will open at 06:00 hrs (BST) as usual. The Bank apologises for any problems caused by the delays to the settlement of payments today and has launched a thorough, independent review of the incident. And that really is all for tonight. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow to see if the wheels of the financial system spin smoothly tomorrow, and to cover aftermath of this rare, unfortunate, and embarrassing systems crash. GW I think\u2019s all for tonight. What a day - I\u2019m dubbing it Red-Faced Monday, given the embarrassment heaped on the Bank of England. Our earlier summary covers the chaos caused after a vital payments system went wrong today: Summary: A bad day for the Bank of England Since then, we\u2019ve had an apology from CHAPS (the \u201cunsung hero\u201d of the banking world) to customers, and home buyers, who were unable to get their payments processed. And MPs continue to pile pressure on the Bank; the Treasury committee may decide to vet the person charged with investigating the biggest system crash in the City in years..... I\u2019ll update the blog again if there are more developments. Otherwise goodnight, and if you\u2019ve been trying to move house today, good luck..... Andrew Tyrie MP, head of the Treasury committee, has welcomed the decision to hold an independent inquiry into the Bank of England\u2019s system failure. He says it is \u201cappropriate\u201d that an independent reviewer looks into \u201csuch a serious episode\u201d. Tyrie may also want to meet the person leading the probe, he added, in a letter just released: CHAPS has just issued a statement, apologising for the disruption caused to its service by the problems at the Bank of England. Phil Kenworthy, managing director of CHAPS Co says: \u201cFollowing the operational incident at the Bank of England earlier today, CHAPS would like to apologise for any delays any customers may have experienced with their payments and would ask that anyone impacted by this contact their Bank or Building Society for assistance.\u201d Kenworthy also reveals that CHAPS, which finally started working around 4pm today, managed to process more than 140,000 payments -- a typical day\u2019s work. The decision to keep open late paid off. \u201cToday, CHAPS\u2019 payments were held up for several hours due to technical issues in the Bank of England Real Time Settlement Central System. We are pleased to report that the problem was resolved mid-afternoon and, following an extension to the CHAPS processing day, just under 143,000 payments were settled - in line with the normal average day\u2019s volumes.\u201d Time\u2019s up, Chaps! No, I\u2019m not reliving my days as an Oxford pub barman (nostalgia). It\u2019s 8pm, which means the Bank of England should be turning off its real-time gross settlement system right now. Did all the orders get processed? Are house movers still in limbo? It\u2019s not clear if we\u2019ll find out tonight.... Time for a recap: The Bank of England faces tough questions tonight after a key system that underpins the UK financial sector crashed, and was out of action for most of the day. In the last few minutes the BoE announced that it will hold an independent inquiry, and the results will be published. It promised to find: the causes of the incident, the effectiveness of the Bank\u2019s response and the lessons learned for future contingency plans. Andrew Tyrie, head of the Treasury Committee, is demanding answers on what went wrong. And the Law Society wants reassurances that it can\u2019t happen again. There were already calls for a thorough inquiry into the failure of the Real Time Gross Settlement RTGS system, which only began working at 4pm. RTGS is due to keep processing payments until 8pm tonight, four hours later than usual, in a bid to clear the backlog. RTGS allows banks to transfer money between each other almost instantly (explainer here). It handling large cash payments between banks, businesses, and between house sellers and buyers. It failed to launch at 6am, following technical changes to add another bank to the system. CHAPS (or Clearing House Automated Payment System), which is used for house sales, was offline until around 4pm today. This left thousands of home-movers unable to complete their transactions. In Sheffield, an 88-year old lady and her son found they were unable to move house as planned, as their removals van stood packed on the driveway. With the systems in limbo, solicitors eventually hammered out a legal agreement to get the move underway, we are hearing tonight. And in Great Missenden, Amanda Hart found the payment for her property hadn\u2019t arrived. She lent the buyers the keys so they could crack on, and was left wondering how the delay would affect her own plans. The National Association of Estate Agents has predicted a \u2018cascade effect\u2019, as thwarted house buyers are forced to cancel removals vans and delay utility work. Housing analyst Neal Hudson points out that Monday is not the busiest day of the week for completions, but nor is it the quietest. Nice one Bloomberg: Here\u2019s the official statement from the Bank of England: Bank of England statement \u2013 Independent review into RTGS payment system disruption The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has launched a thorough, independent review of the causes of today\u2019s disruption to RTGS, the Bank\u2019s system for settling high value payments. The review will cover the causes of the incident, the effectiveness of the Bank\u2019s response and the lessons learned for future contingency plans. Its findings will be presented to Court which will then publish the full report and the response. Just in.... the Bank of England has announced that a \u2018thorough\u2019 independent inquiry will be held into today\u2019s system outage. And the results will be published. Time for another tale of house moving angst, this time in Colchester. Joe Friedlein told the Evening Standard that his house move was on hold today: \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens. We\u2019ve got four houses in the chain and none of those (sales) can occur because the money can\u2019t be handed around. I rang my solicitor this morning and he said that they hadn\u2019t received any funds and that nothing had come through from my mortgage provider. Today\u2019s glitch may be fixed, but it still raises serious questions over the Bank of England\u2019s competency. Swaha Pattanaik and Dominic Elliott of Reuters BreakingViews argue that Andrew Tyrie and the Treasury Committee need to get tough. After all, the BoE hasn\u2019t been slow to criticise others.... Former BoE Governor Mervyn King rapped Royal Bank of Scotland for an IT bungle which affected the lender\u2019s customers in 2012. The Financial Conduct Authority is now investigating what happened at RBS as a result.To avoid accusations of double standards, the BoE should submit to an equally rigorous inspection. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the UK parliament\u2019s treasury committee, has called for the BoE to explain itself. An internal investigation is likely, but a third-party probe would be the best way to restore confidence. James Quinn of the Telegraph warns that the Bank can\u2019t just cover up the incident: What this incident serves to highlight is the fragility of the Bank\u2019s technology platform, a fragility that has been exposed in the most public of ways, despite the Bank\u2019s initial reticence to discuss what had occurred. Andrea Leadsom, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, has in the past lectured retail banks on the need to increase the levels of technology expenditure. Is it now time for the Treasury - and the Treasury Select Committee, whose chairman Andrew Tyrie last night said he was writing to the Bank to find out what had gone on - to raise the same point with the Bank itself to ensure that such an unlikely problem does not happen again Today\u2019s system outage must have been particularly worrying for anyone whose house sale or purchase was delayed from last week. In The Telegraph, mortgage broker Jonathan Harris explains: \u201cHowever, with everyone pushing to complete on a Friday there are a proportion of deals which don\u2019t happen - maybe 15pc - which are pushed back to the following Monday. These are already critical and if they are delayed yet again, it will be hugely inconvenient for buyers.\u201d Parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee will be demanding answers to find out how the Real Time Gross Settlement system, such a vital part of Britain\u2019s financial system, could fail today. Committee chairman, Andrew Tyrie MP, says: \u201cA crucial part of the UK\u2019s financial infrastructure failed for several hours today. I will be writing to the Bank of England to find out why. \u201cThe whole economy depends on a reliable payment system. We need to have confidence that the cause has been found and addressed.\u201d Could governor Mark Carney be hauled to parliament? I do hope so... The Bank of England has also confirmed that its Real-Time Gross Settlement system is (at last!) fixed. They say: The Bank of England confirms it is now processing payments through RTGS as normal. We have extended opening hours until 20:00 hrs (BST) to maximise the opportunity for settlement. That\u2019s not a guarantee that all the payments WILL be settled today..... It\u2019s official, the Chaps system is up and running. That means the Bank of England must have (finally) fixed its Real-Time Gross Settlement system that underpins the UK financial system. Here\u2019s the official statement, which confirms that it will keep running until 7.40pm. \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s RTGS system is now processing payments again following a resolution of the technical issue experienced earlier today. As such, CHAPS is now processing the backlog of payments and is confident that all payments submitted today will be processed today. To help customers and to ensure payments can be processed today CHAPS is extending its operating times until 19.40 hrs. Customers are advised to contact their own bank for any queries they may have on their specific payments.\u201d We\u2019re hearing that that Chaps system might, after many hours, finally be up and running again. Harry Wilson of The Times reckons it will be able to clear today\u2019s backlog in time: Over in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, Amanda Hart\u2019s plan to sell her property today has been hit by the collapse of the Chaps system. She explains that a friend warned her about the problems at the Bank of England this morning. Then, her buyers\u2019 estate agent phoned her to explain the problems, and to promise that the money had gone into the system. Her buyers had to move out of their home today, so Amanda has (rather kindly) let them into her house to prepare for the move, even though they don\u2019t own it yet. \u201cIt\u2019s an inconvenience, and I\u2019m bugged and annoyed,\u201d she tells me. She explains how her delay will affect her personal finances: There were purchases that I was going to make today with these funds, which I can\u2019t now make. And there are creditors I was going to pay off, which could mean another day\u2019s interest. Fortunately, Amanda is moving in with her partner, so she\u2019s the end of this chain. \u201cI guess I\u2019m one of the lucky ones.\u201d Just in...The Chaps system is going to keep running until 7.40pm to process transactions. NatWest have been told by the Bank of England that the problems should be fixed, so that payments can be processed today: The Law Society is demanding answers about what went wrong with such a vital system. Vice president Jonathan Smithers says: \u201cIt is critical for solicitors to have access to this system for house sales and purchases and many other commercial transactions that rely on a payments scheme that processes and settles important and time-dependent payments in sterling. We are talking to the relevant bodies to see if we can obtain some understanding of why the system has failed and assurances that this will not occur again.\u201d Monday is the third-most popular day for completing a home sale, according to housing expert Neal Hudson who kindly tweeted this chart. So on a typical Monday, around 2,000 people would be using the Chaps system. It is likely that a software glitch is to blame for the collapse, taking the Bank\u2019s back-up system as well as the live site. The Bank of England recently published a research paper on its efforts to improve the resiliency of the Real-Time Gross Settlement infrastructure (which underpins CHAPS). It explains that there is a standby site, which duplicates the hardware and software of the live site, to avoid problems. However, it added: It is conceivable that both sites could become unavailable at the same time. Environmental factors leading to an inability to physically operate at a site, or IT hardware failures, could cause two simultaneous but unrelated problems. Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, there could be a software failure which creates a single problem that affects both sites. Such an event resulted in a six-hour service interruption to the Bank\u2019s RTGS infrastructure on 12 February 2007. Technology site The Register has a handy explanation of what went wrong: We were told that the problem was due to an update over the weekend, when the details of new CHAPS users were being added and old ones removed. This is meant to be a routine operation, but a glitch caused the system to fall down. Adding a new bank to the system would usually be a routine operation. The collapse of the Chaps system will have a knock-on effect on people trying to move house today, experts are warning. Mark Hayward, managing director of the National Association of Estate Agents, fears a \u2018cascade effect\u2019, if payments due to be processed today are delayed until Tuesday. This could mess up hiring a removals firm, or switching telephone, water, electricity and gas supplies. Hayward explains: \u201cWhilst Monday is not the busiest day in terms of completions, the failure of the payments system for UK house purchases will have a cascading effect and it is likely any payments will now be held up for a day or more as money takes time to transfer, which also means a delay for those hoping to move. This week is half term for many, so it will be a time when a lot of people are trying to move house \u2013 no doubt it will be a frustration for those that are now delayed. \u201cThe one part of a sale which is fixed is the completion date - with payments not being able to be processed today, this will not only have an effect in terms of the completion date moving, but also accompanying arrangements which may have been scheduled, such as moving support or van hire and the transfer of utilities to the new address.\u201d It\u2019s pretty rare for a vital systems such as the Chaps payment service, which handles hundreds of billions of pounds each day, to crash in this way. Technical glitches are inevitable, which is why there should be a back-up system in place, points out Izzy Kaminska of the Financial Times: Euroclear, which is the world\u2019s largest securities transactions company, says it working closely with the Bank of England as it strives to get its Chaps payment system online again. Here\u2019s the statement: Euroclear is monitoring the current technical issue with the RTGS system at the Bank of England. We are working closely with the BoE and if necessary will extend our own operational deadlines, to ensure that all settlement and payment instructions will be processed today. Two families selling their homes through Andersons estate agents in Sheffield are caught up in the uncertainty caused by the collapse of the Bank of England\u2019s Chaps payment system. My colleague Hilary Osborne has the story: Both transactions are in the same chain and were set to complete today. Kaye Orwin who is handling the sales, told The Guardian: \u201cThe solicitors called to say that money had been put in the system from the purchase at the bottom of the chain but then it couldn\u2019t come out.\u201d The sellers who were next up the chain, an 88-year-old woman and her son, were already packed and ready to go when things went wrong. \u201cThe removal van was sat on the driveway,\u201d said Orwin. \u201cWe\u2019ve opened the garage and they are putting things in there for now. The buyers at the bottom of the chain have to be out of their rental home today\u201d Orwin said in more than 20 years selling homes she had never experienced this kind of problem. The solicitors involved in the sale are now trying to find a solution so that the families can move even if the money has not been transferred by late afternoon. Helen Neville, a solicitor at Hugh James, also fears that house completions could be delayed today: The Bank of England is in a race against time to fix its Chaps payments system, and people who want to move house today must be watching nervously. Andrew Montlake, at the mortgage broker Coreco, has told us that people moving house usually complete the deal by 3pm. \u201cIf there are going to be Chaps issues then we won\u2019t know yet \u2013 transfers usually need to be done by 3pm if someone is to complete on that day. It\u2019s worth adding that Monday is not the biggest completion day \u2013 Fridays tend to be the most popular day.\u201d That\u2019s why Chaps\u2019 decision to extend its operational hours is so important (see statement at 12.49pm) Here\u2019s our news story on the collapse of the Bank of England\u2019s crucial payment system (see 11.33am): People buying or selling a house and businesses trying to shift large sums of money faced delays on Monday after the Bank of England mechanism used for transferring money failed. The behind-the-scenes payment system \u2013 which processes, on average, about \u00a3277bn of transactions daily \u2013 failed to open as usual at 6am. The Bank said the retail-time gross settlement system (RTGS) had been hit by a technical issue and could give no indication of when it might be resolved. The largest, most crucial payments would be processed manually. The system deals with payments as they happen, rather than waiting until the end of the day to process them. This so-called Chaps system processes 92% of transactions between banks and is used to process large-value transactions, such as house purchases. The average payment is \u00a32.1m..... Full story: Bank of England payment system crashes And you can scroll back to 12.04pm for an explanation of how the Chaps system works.... Back to the problems at the Bank of England\u2019s RTGS payments system. Bank insiders say that the Bacs system, for electronic payments such as direct debts, is still working. As is Faster Payments, used for internet and telephone banking. But the glitch is hampering the CHAPS system, which means that any bank or business trying to move large sums of money, or anyone trying to buy or sell a house today, is affected. And we just have a statement from CHAPS -- pinning the blame firmly on the Bank of England. They are also planning to extend their operational day, in the hope of avoiding disruption. They say: \u201cCHAPS is currently unable to process payments. This is due to the Bank of England temporarily pausing the RTGS settlement system to resolve a technical issue. CHAPS is currently liaising with the Bank of England who are working hard to resolve the issue \u2013 which means payments submitted today will be processed. CHAPS will be extending its operational day to enable its Participants to submit and receive CHAPS payment instructions later than normal. Almost 80% of CHAPS payments (by value) are wholesale financial payments \u2013 both domestic and cross-border. Any customer who is waiting for a CHAPS payment to settle today should speak to their own bank.\u201d IBM\u2019s disappointing results have not helped the mood in the stock markets. The FTSE 100 is now down another 64 points, or 1%, and there are steeper losses in France (-1.3%) and Germany (-1.5%). And we\u2019re now expecting the Dow Jones index to fall when Wall Street opens; IBM makes up a large slice of the overall index. Ouch. IBM has just given the market a nasty jolt, reporting that sales have missed expectations and warned that it suffered a slowdown in September. Revenues at the world\u2019s largest technology services group fell 4% in the last three months, to $22.4bn. And earnings per share have fallen 8% on a GAAP accounting basis. Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer admitted that \u201cWe are disappointed in our performance.\u201d She added: We saw a marked slowdown in September in client buying behavior, and our results also point to the unprecedented pace of change in our industry. While we did not produce the results we expected to achieve, we again performed well in our strategic growth areas \u2013 cloud, data and analytics, security, social and mobile - where we continue to shift our business. We will accelerate this transformation.\u201d And Wall Street isn\u2019t impressed; IBM shares have tumbled almost 8% in pre-market trading. IBM Reports 2014 Third-Quarter Results It\u2019s a worry, hours after German software maker SAP cut its 2014 operating profit forecast and warned that customers were shifting to new Cloud-based services faster than expected. And this chart shows JUST how much money is transferred each day through the Bank of England\u2019s RTGS payments system: Our understanding is that CHAPS, the system used for large inter-bank payments, is the only one badly affected by today\u2019s RTGS outage. This article explains exactly how the Bank of England\u2019s RTGS system holds the UK financial system together, and why today\u2019s technical problems are so unfortunate: The Bank of England\u2019s Real-Time Gross Settlement infrastructure It outlines how RTGS allows commercial banks to maintain reserves of sterling at the Bank, which are then used to settle interbank obligations as banks, and their customers, make payments to each other. As they put it: One principal design feature of the infrastructure is its ability to make certain types of transfers continuously throughout the day. Until it breaks.... And the Bank also provides this simple example: Suppose a customer of a gas company wants to pay a bill using an electronic payment. If the customer and the gas company happen to have accounts with the same commercial bank, the payment can be made very simply: the bank just debits the customer\u2019s account and credits an equal amount to the company\u2019s account. No obligation between banks arises. But if the customer and the gas company have accounts with different commercial banks, then an interbank obligation does arise. To achieve the transfer from the customer to the company, the customer\u2019s bank debits the customer\u2019s account, and the company\u2019s bank credits an equal amount to the company\u2019s account. At this stage the customer has in effect made a transfer to their bank, and the company\u2019s bank has made a transfer to the company. An obligation has been created: the customer\u2019s bank owes the company\u2019s bank the value of the payment. To eliminate this exposure, and complete the end-to-end transfer from the customer to the company, a transfer must be made from the customer\u2019s bank to the company\u2019s bank. This final transfer is known as \u2018settlement\u2019. The Bank of England is suffering \u201cevery central bank\u2019s nightmare\u201d, says financial analyst Lorcan Roche Kelly. BREAKING NEWS: The computer system which the Bank of England uses to transfer large funds between commercial banks in the UK has suffered a technical outage. It\u2019s a major embarrassment for the BoE. The Real Time Gross Settlement system is a vital cog in the wheels of the City, used by banks all the time to shift large amounts of money in the system. It is part of the Bank\u2019s Clearing House Automated Payment System, or CHAPS. The outage means that large value inter-bank fund transfers can\u2019t be made. The Bank insists that payments will be made, so the public shouldn\u2019t panic. CHAPS describes itself as \u201cunsung hero\u201d of banking world, and celebrated its 30th anniversary this year. It handles an average of \u00a3277bn of payments per day. Many of them are under \u00a3100,000 each -- such as housing purchases. Here\u2019s the Bank\u2019s official statement: The Bank of England has identified a technical issue related to some routine maintenance of the RTGS payment system and has paused settlement while we resolve it. We are working to address this issue as quickly as possible, and restart the RTGS payment system in a controlled manner. The most important payments are being made manually and we can reassure the public that all payments made today will be processed. Twenty seven years ago, investors were reeling from the Black Monday crash of 1987. 19th October was the day when the US Dow Jones index lost a fifth of its value in a truly stupendous wipeout. In London, there was panic selling on the Monday (-10%), and an even deeper sell-off on Tuesday 20th October (-12%) (today\u2019s anniversary). That, ladies and gentleman, is what a crash really looks like..... More reassuringly, the prices of Greek sovereign debt has strengthened, pushing down yields (the rate of interest on the debt). 10-year Greek bonds are yielding 7.97% this morning, down from 8.04% on Friday night. They had soared, from around 6.6%, last week after it emerged that Greece might leave its bailout without a precautionary credit line. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Although still early, investors it seems are not convinced that the debt-stricken country is going to be able to avoid political turbulence - or stand on its own feet if its exits its EU-IMF bailout programme as the government has announced. Wading into the turbulence, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble warned in an interview published this morning that Greece will only convince markets if it forges ahead with promised reforms. \u201cGreece must resolutely continue to implement the agreed reforms. It is in its own interests. Being reliable creates confidence, also on the markets,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said when asked if it should give up planning to rely on emerging funds from lenders which include the ECB. The debt-stricken country\u2019s troika of creditors are due to return to Athens by the end of the month (and possibly as early as Friday) and are racheting up the pressure on the coalition government to take the immensely unpopular steps of further cutting pensions and making mass lay offs in the public sector. In the face of market reaction, prime minister Antonis Samaras has been forced to counter suggestions that he will have to roll back on his idea of exiting the bailout, saying Greece does not need \u201ca third memorandum [of financial loans]\u201d and will enter talks with lenders over a precautionary credit line. he said. \u201cMarkets over-reacted and over-reaction will eventually give way to reality,\u201d \u2018If you look at recent official statement, no one is doubting that Greece has the foundation and prospects to advance. The discussion that is taking place is how we will proceed in the safest way possible.\u201d  The eurozone bond market is generally calmer today: The European Central Bank has begun its new stimulus programme today, buying up covered bonds (debt backed by a cash flow from, say, mortgages or consumer loans). And Bloomberg is reporting that the ECB has wasted no time in mopping up debt from France. The ECB hopes that the scheme will encourage banks to offer credit to small businesses in Europe, to drive economic activity and inflation (assuming they can find firms who actually want to borrow....). Risk remains off the menu this morning At least the mood in the markets is less negative than last week. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, agrees: It might be a soft start for the FTSE down 32 points, but there is not the same undercurrent of panic seen in last week\u2019s trading. After a steady start, Europe\u2019s main stock markets are on the slide again. The German DAX and French CAC are both down around 1%, and even the FTSE 100 is lurking in negative territory, down around 26 points. The market surge in Asia overnight (see earlier posts) has not rippled through to Europe and the City. The news that Italy\u2019s factory orders in August were 3.2% down on last year hasn\u2019t helped the mood, which remains jittery. Kit Juckes, currency analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, writes: Everything is considerably calmer. Asian markets saw gains for equities and for the won, the rupiah, the baht and in G10, the Australian and New Zealand dollars. But as Europeans arrive at dealing desks, the mood is hardly ecstatic and FTSE, CAC and DAA are all firmly in negative territory. Risk sentiment may improved but not enough to drag the SG Risk Sentiment Indicator out of deep aversion (it\u2019s at 0.13 on a 0-1 scale). Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, agrees that traders are nervous: There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in play early in the European session with traders evidently struggling as to how to call this market. Just in.... Italian industrial orders have risen, ending a three-month slide, but the broader picture remains weak. Industrial orders rose by 1.5% month-on-month in August, a bigger rise than expected. However, orders are 3.2% down on a year ago, extending the 0.7% annual decline recorded in July. Industrial unrest has hit the eurozone today, with strikes hurting travellers in Germany. In another sign of tensions in Europe\u2019s largest economy, German pilots union VC widened its strike at Lufthansa this morning to include long-haul flights. It will hit 1,450 flights and around 200,000 travellers, according to the BBC. Unions are protesting against Lufthansa\u2019s attemps to change their pension terms. The walkout follows an ugly weekend on Germany\u2019s rail network, where a strike over an unrelated pay dispute halted around two-thirds of inter-city trains. Not a great start to the school holidays..... Tesco shares are the biggest riser in London this morning, up 3%, ahead of Thursday\u2019s delayed (and much anticipated) financial results. These results were postponed while the supermarket giant investigated how its profits were overstated by \u00a3250m. It is expected to tell shareholders that this is an isolated issue, only involving a small group of staff. More here. Hmmm, European stock markets are making a cautious start to the week. The FTSE 100 is up 8 points at 6317, but the German and French markets have dipped. One reason for caution -- eurozone inflation expectations continue to fall: All the major Asia-Pacific markets gained ground overnight, as fears over global growth prospects receded. Various dovish comments from central bankers late last week helped to calm the mood. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains: Sentiment has been boosted by investor belief that Central Banks will avoid tightening too soon and will remain accommodative via more quantitative easing, and by keeping interest rates low for longer. The Nikkei surged today despite Japan\u2019s government being hit by two ministerial resignations. Japan\u2019s Justice Minister Midori Matsushima quit after being accused of violating election laws. Hours earlier, trade and industry inister Yuko Obuchi resigned after opponents alleged she had misused party funds. This cuts the number of women in the cabinet from five to three. It\u2019s a double blow to PM Shinzo Abe, as his cabinet ponders whether to push on and hike the national sales tax. Two Japanese ministers quit after financial allegations Japan\u2019s stock market has posted its biggest jump of the year today, as fears over the global economy recede. The Nikkei 225 index surged by 4%, or 578 points, to close at 15,111, helped by strong US consumer confidence data released on Friday. Every share rose, with manufacturers leading the rally. Hitachi jumped 8%, NEC is up 6.5% and Mitsubishi gained 6.3%. Shares were helped by the yen weakening against the US dollar, which should make exports more competitive. Reuters explains: The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment was surprisingly strong in early October, rising to more than a seven-year high. Other data also showed new housing starts rose more than expected last month, suggesting U.S. economic growth was solid. The upbeat U.S. data has brought some calm to markets after a week of turbulence as signs of softening global growth roiled investors and sent volatility spiking. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. \u201cWhat we have seen over the past week is financial markets catching up with the data. Possibly overreacting to the data but certainly catching up..... So mused Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, on a trip to Coventry late last week. And it looks like the catching-up job may be over, at least for a little while. European markets are expected to rise this morning, extending Friday\u2019s recovery, and reversing a little of the recent rout. Stan Shamu of IG explains: After big gains on Friday, it doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019ll have any major catalysts in today\u2019s trade. ....There is also mild strength in the sterling on the back of comments by the BoE\u2019s chief economist, who suggested markets may have overreacted to some recent weak data. Here\u2019s IG\u2019s opening calls: FTSE 6336 +26 DAX 8884 +34 CAC 4034 +1 IBEX 9930 -27 MIB 18765 +64 Not much on the agenda; but the monthly report from the German Bundesbank, due around 10am BST, could be interesting. Haldane\u2019s full interview, published in the Observer yesterday, is well worth a read. He\u2019s gloomier about global, and UK, economic prospects -- but is encouraged when he gets out and actually speaks to business people in the real economy. He also pines for a Star Trek-style console, putting all the data showing how the world economy is functioning at his fingertips. \u201cThe absence of that global financial weather map has never been more harmful.\u201d Bank of England\u2019s chief economist struggles with stance on Britain\u2019s prospects I\u2019ll be (boldly) tracking all the main developments through the day as usual....",

If the customer and the gas company happen to have accounts with the same commercial bank, the payment can be made very simply: the bank just debits the customer\u2019s account and credits an equal amount to the company\u2019s account. No obligation between banks arises. </p> <p>But if the customer and the gas company have accounts with different commercial banks, then an interbank obligation does arise. To achieve the transfer from the customer to the company, the customer\u2019s bank debits the customer\u2019s account, and the company\u2019s bank credits an equal amount to the company\u2019s account. At this stage the customer has in effect made a transfer to their bank, and the company\u2019s bank has made a transfer to the company. An obligation has been created: the customer\u2019s bank owes the company\u2019s bank the value of the payment. To eliminate this exposure, and complete the end-to-end transfer from the customer to the company, a transfer must be made from the customer\u2019s bank to the company\u2019s bank. This final transfer is known as \u2018settlement\u2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5444e75ce4b0f39f234da0fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-20T10:44:20.634Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Bank of England is suffering \u201cevery central bank\u2019s nightmare\u201d, says financial analyst <strong>Lorcan Roche Kelly</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LorcanRK/statuses/524148181131882497\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>This is every cb&#39;s nightmare (presume will be fixed fast) RT <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fastFT\">@fastFT</a>: Bank of England pauses RTGS payment system <a href=\"http://t.co/Mzk64Q775U\">http://t.co/Mzk64Q775U</a></p>&mdash; Lorcan Roche Kelly (@LorcanRK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LorcanRK/status/524148181131882497\">October 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-20T10:51:11.080Z\">at 11.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5444e22ae4b0ac2189f2cde6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-20T10:33:16.859Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of England's real-time payment service has broken down</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d3663e56-47c7-442a-b1a8-3fef217d807a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/20/1413801123234/f189ff5e-1470-4f6c-b253-fa4200e7f512-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Bank of England\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bank of England</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>BREAKING NEWS: </strong>The computer system which the Bank of England uses to transfer large funds between commercial banks in the UK has suffered a technical outage.<br></p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a major embarrassment for the BoE.</strong> </p> <p>The Real Time Gross Settlement system is a vital cog in the wheels of the City, used by banks all the time to shift large amounts of money in the system.</p> <p>It is part of the Bank\u2019s Clearing House Automated Payment System, or CHAPS. </p> <p>The outage means that large value inter-bank fund transfers can\u2019t be made.</p> <p>The Bank insists that payments will be made, so the public shouldn\u2019t panic.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chapsco.co.uk/media/press_releases/-/page/2816/\">CHAPS describes itself as \u201cunsung hero\u201d of banking world</a>, and celebrated its 30th anniversary this year.</p> <p>It handles an average of \u00a3277bn of payments per day.

      "bodyText": "Christian Candy is a tax exile, and proud of it. \u201cWhat!\u201d he once exclaimed during a game of Monopoly with a Financial Times reporter, when he had the misfortune of landing on the super-tax square. \u201cI don\u2019t pay tax. I\u2019m a tax exile.\u201d The high-profile property developer \u2013 who with his brother, Nick, developed the superluxe One Hyde Park apartment complex for London\u2019s oligarchs and is now converting a row of seven houses overlooking Regent\u2019s Park into a single 4,600 sq metre London mansion \u2013 even named his twins Isabella Monaco Evanthia and Cayman Charles Wolf. But don\u2019t try to join the dots. The children, born last year to Christian and his socialite turned criminal psychologist wife, Lady Emily Crompton-Candy, are definitely not named after notorious tax havens. A family spokesman said Cayman is named after one of his dad\u2019s favourite cars. \u201cChristian and Emily liked the name Cayman in relation to the Porsche,\u201d she said. It is not entirely clear why they chose Monaco for the little girl \u2013 there is no Porsche Monaco \u2013 but it is where the family live. A tour of the Candy car collection, however, would provide plenty of inspiration for naming any future additions to the family. When he and Nick lived together in what was once billionaire banker Edmond Safra\u2019s 1,625 sq metre Monaco penthouse, Nick boasted that their garage housed a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Rolls-Royce convertible, Mercedes SLR McLaren, Ferrari F430 Spider, Ferrari 575M Maranello, two Range Rovers, a Cherokee Jeep and a Renault Clio. \u201cIt was a lark,\u201d he said. \u201cWe liked cars.\u201d Certainly, there will be plenty of space for cars at Christian\u2019s new Regent\u2019s Park property. The latest acquisition, of seven Grade I-listed John Nash townhouses on Cambridge Terrace and 1-2 Chester Gate, boasts underground parking for more than a dozen motors and a 12-metre roof garden \u2013 the \u201changing gardens of Camden\u201d. According to Land Registry filings, the building is owned by a British Virgin Islands company, with Christian Candy\u2019s financial interest in the company listed from August. He is reported to have bought it from his fellow property magnate Marcus Cooper for close to \u00a3100m. The brothers declined to answer any questions asked by the Guardian before publication, including whether Christian intended to live in the property following a refurbishment. Nick, 41, and Christian, 40, are very rich, and they want you to know it. As well as properties in Monaco, Manhattan, Los Angeles, London and elsewhere, the brothers have owned the superyachts Candyscape I and II (which featured a \u20ac100,000 (\u00a378,000) Perspex Schimmel piano that plays itself), a powerboat called Catch Me If You Candy, and private jets. There are also \u00a310,000 Girard-Perregaux watches and handmade \u00a31,000-a-pair Berluti shoes. They are Conservative party donors , and Nick shared a table with former party treasurer Lord Fink at the 2013 summer fundraising party. Opulence, rather than wealth, is the brand, and the Candymen are its biggest ambassadors. \u201cIt\u2019s a brand. You want people to have the right opinion,\u201d Nick has said. The more outlandish the building project, the more column inches the brothers have attracted. In the early days Nick boasted that clients \u2013 mostly Russian or Middle Eastern billionaires \u2013 had asked for \u201ca jacuzzi on a private jet\u201d, \u201cswimming pools that turn into ballrooms\u201d and a \u201chelicopter with a boardroom in the back\u201d. He explained to the Daily Mail that the brothers\u2019 clients were \u201cyou know \u2026 rulers of countries, oligarchs, some of the richest entrepreneurs in the world\u201d. But while many of the world\u2019s richest people go to extreme lengths to keep the true scale of their wealth secret, the Candys fight to correct underestimates of their fortune. In 2008 they appeared in the Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated wealth of \u00a3120m. The brothers viewed this as embarrassingly low-ball and took the unusual step of opening up their offshore books (their main company CPC Group is registered in Guernsey), which resulted in their estimated fortune jumping to \u00a3330m in 2009. But it dropped back to \u00a3300m a year later. Unimpressed, their people put a call in to Philip Beresford, compiler of the Rich List for the past 26 years. \u201cThey grumbled about it being too low,\u201d Beresford said. Twice Beresford arranged a meeting with the Candys\u2019 finance man so they could prove their greater wealth, and twice they cancelled. Beresford has omitted them from the list ever since. \u201cThey don\u2019t go in because I can\u2019t see enough evidence of huge wealth. Sure, they have built One Hyde Park and one of them has bought the big house recently, but until I am sure they made the millions from One Hyde Park, I will not put them in. \u201cI have enough trouble getting rich lists out and negotiating the minefields of vast egos without taking them on board too.\u201d Beresford said they will remain barred from the list \u201cuntil [the] huge wealth which is attributable to them appears in Companies House\u201d. Last year Nick claimed that the brothers\u2019 rise \u201cfrom nothing\u201d had attracted the attention of Hollywood scriptwriters asking to \u201cwrite a story about you, because it\u2019s quite a success story\u201d. So far, no feature film appears to be under way, but the boys were not quite born into nothing. Nick was born in Wimbledon in January 1973, a year and a half before Christian, to an Anglo-Italian father, Anthony, who ran an advertising production company, and Patricia, a Greek-Cypriot drama teacher. They grew up mostly in the wealthy Surrey commuter town of Banstead and were educated privately in Epsom. Nick read human geography at Reading University, before joining the accountants KPMG. There followed a spell in advertising at J Walter Thompson and Dentsu Group, where he became the youngest director. Christian studied business at King\u2019s College London before joining a commodity trading firm. Nick said, at the Mipim property conference last week, that the brothers got into property \u201cfrom a very young age\u201d \u2013 his parents \u201cdragged me round houses because they aspired to live in a better house\u201d. Their first foray into property came in 1995. With a \u00a36,000 loan from their grandmother and a mortgage guarantee from their father they bought a one-bed flat in Fulham for \u00a3122,000. They refurbished it, selling it on18 months later for a \u00a350,000 profit. On the next flat they doubled their money, giving them the confidence to found the interior design firm Candy &amp; Candy in 1999, taking their cue from the success of advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, founded by brothers Maurice and Charles. Then they started to get noticed. \u201cOne day they were a couple of likely lads, the next they were everywhere,\u201d said Henry Pryor, a luxury property buying agent. \u201cThey understood the marketing and selling of property. They sold people a dream. \u201cThey very successfully and quite determinedly delivered what people wanted. They\u2019ve created a brand within property, which no one had done until they came along. Consumers say: \u2018I don\u2019t want any luxury flat, I want a Candy flat.\u2019\u201d But he cautioned that some people question the pricing of some Candy properties, which hit a record \u00a3136m in 2011 for a One Hyde Park flat sold to Ukraine\u2019s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov. \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get,\u201d Pryor said. Nick bridles at suggestions that as there are rarely that many lights on in One Hyde Park flats at night, it might mean not many of the foreign buyers actually live there. \u201cYou might leave your light on when you go for a meal in a restaurant,\u201d he told the audience at Mipim in the Olympia conference centre. \u201cI don\u2019t leave my lights on because I\u2019ve got the Mandarin Oriental staff downstairs looking after the building.\u201d Friends and associates say the pair, although very close and known to finish each other\u2019s sentences, have very different temperaments. Christian is described as \u201cthe brainier one, the numbers man\u201d, while Nick is \u201cthe showman\u201d. Someone who has worked closely with them in the past said: \u201cThey\u2019re really interesting characters. Chris is a strange mixture of bombast and insecurity, while Nick is the face that people see of the Candys.\u201d Nick, he said, \u201cdrops names like they\u2019re going out fashion\u201d. \u201cIt is always about who he has had in his house for the Monaco Grand Prix. You get this feeling that he wants to be liked. He likes to stay in the best hotels. He likes flashy boats. He can actually be quite good company, but he has a bit of a temper when things don\u2019t go his way.\u201d Once a serial dater, Nick settled down when he met former Neighbours actor Holly Valance in 2009. He proposed to her in the Maldives with \u2018Will you marry me\u2019 spelled out in flaming torches on the beach and they married in a lavish outdoor ceremony in Beverly Hills in 2012. According to Hello! magazine, the wedding \u2013 attended by Simon Cowell and a sprinkling of minor royals \u2013 cost \u00a33m, with a reported \u00a31.2m given to Katy Perry as the wedding singer. Valance describes him as \u201clike a naughty schoolboy to my naughty schoolgirl\u201d. She told the Daily Mail: \u201cHe is a genius with his work but in other areas I do sometimes have to protect him \u2026 He will say: \u2018You protect me, don\u2019t you?\u2019 and I say: \u2018Yeah, I would kill for you.\u2019\u201d Giles Barrie, managing director at FTI Consulting and former editor of Property Week, said the brothers\u2019 moment of real genius came when they bought Bowater House, a shabby 1950s office block on the site of One Hyde Park for \u00a3150m in 2004 and convinced the Qatari royal family they should help them spend almost \u00a31bn to develop it. \u201cThat\u2019s what sent them into warp drive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey created something in property for the uber-rich that no one had thought of. They realised London was becoming a magnet for global wealth and they created a location for that super-wealth. \u201c A lot of people knock them, but what they\u2019ve achieved has been eye-watering and pretty breathtaking.\u201d The brothers\u2019 public relations are handled not by a financial media relations firm, but by showbiz PR Neil Reading, whose other clients include John Cleese, Stephen Fry and Dawn French. On Reading\u2019s website, Nick Candy gushes: \u201cNRPR [Neil Reading PR] has guided us in formulating an ambitious strategy to help boost our profile and meet our niche target audience. \u201cWe value their expertise in media relations and huge breadth of journalistic experience in placing stories on our behalf and their skill in crisis management. They have gone above and beyond our brief in developing our media relations.\u201d The brothers also take an active role in managing their own media relations. They have rolled out the names of their claimed celebrity mates \u2013 Cowell, Kylie Minogue, Ryan Seacrest, Bernie Ecclestone, Prince Albert of Monaco and the Topshop magnate Sir Philip Green \u2013 to garner column inches. But journalists who have been covering the pair\u2019s businesses for a long time warn that they sometimes also claim to be \u201cfriends with the editor\u201d. Reporters also warn that the brothers have a team of lawyers on speed dial and will fire off threatening emails. The brothers were \u201cunable\u201d to answer any of the questions the Guardian asked in advance of the publication of this article. \u201cCandy &amp; Candy have asked me to put you on notice that they will instruct lawyers over anything written that is defamatory or incorrect,\u201d Reading said. They are not unused to the courtroom. In one long-running battle against a rich banker, who sued them over the fit and layout of his \u00a312m One Hyde Park apartment, it was revealed they hired a private detective to pose as a middleman for the Saudi royal family to dig for dirt on their own customer. The case was settled with the disgruntled buyer collecting a multimillion payout. Their most high-profile court battle was against their former partners and backers, the Qatari royal family. They took legal action after the Qataris scrapped the Candys\u2019 plans for a \u00a33bn development of Chelsea Barracks after pressure from the Prince of Wales. It was revealed in court that during a face-to-face exchange over tea at Clarence House in 2009, Prince Charles had \u201cpissed in [the Qatari emir\u2019s] ear about how awful the [Lord Rogers-designed] scheme was\u201d. An email from Candy shortly after the meeting said the emir \u201cwent mental\u201d and told the boss of the Qatari Diar real estate firm to withdraw the designs as soon as possible. The Candys claimed the Qatari\u2019s change of heart over the design, due to \u201cdiplomatic and political reasons\u201d, had cost them \u00a381m. The judge ruled that Qatari Diar had breached the terms of the contract, but did not immediately award damages to Christian Candy\u2019s CPC Group. The case was eventually settled out of court with both sides able to claim some sort of victory \u2013 CPC group \u201capologised unreservedly\u201d to the Qatari royal family and Prince Charles, but walked away with an undisclosed sum.

She told the Daily Mail: \u201cHe is a genius with his work but in other areas I do sometimes have to protect him \u2026 He will say: \u2018You protect me, don\u2019t you?\u2019 and I say: \u2018Yeah, I would kill for you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Giles Barrie, managing director at FTI Consulting and former editor of Property Week, said the brothers\u2019 moment of real genius came when they bought Bowater House, a shabby 1950s office block on the site of One Hyde Park for \u00a3150m in 2004 and convinced the Qatari royal family they should help them spend almost \u00a31bn to develop it. \u201cThat\u2019s what sent them into warp drive,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey created something in property for the uber-rich that no one had thought of. They realised London was becoming a magnet for global wealth and they created a location for that super-wealth.</p> <p>\u201c A lot of people knock them, but what they\u2019ve achieved has been eye-watering and pretty breathtaking.\u201d</p> <p>The brothers\u2019 public relations are handled not by a financial media relations firm, but by showbiz PR Neil Reading, whose other clients include John Cleese, Stephen Fry and Dawn French.</p> <p>On Reading\u2019s website, Nick Candy gushes: \u201cNRPR [Neil Reading PR] has guided us in formulating an ambitious strategy to help boost our profile and meet our niche target audience.</p> <p>\u201cWe value their expertise in media relations and huge breadth of journalistic experience in placing stories on our behalf and their skill in crisis management. They have gone above and beyond our brief in developing our media relations.\u201d</p> <p>The brothers also take an active role in managing their own media relations. They have rolled out the names of their claimed celebrity mates \u2013 Cowell, Kylie Minogue, Ryan Seacrest, Bernie Ecclestone, Prince Albert of Monaco and the Topshop magnate Sir Philip Green \u2013 to garner column inches. But journalists who have been covering the pair\u2019s businesses for a long time warn that they sometimes also claim to be \u201cfriends with the editor\u201d. Reporters also warn that the brothers have a team of lawyers on speed dial and will fire off threatening emails.</p> <p>The brothers were \u201cunable\u201d to answer any of the questions the Guardian asked in advance of the publication of this article. \u201cCandy &amp; Candy have asked me to put you on notice that they will instruct lawyers over anything written that is defamatory or incorrect,\u201d Reading said.</p> <p>They are not unused to the courtroom. In one long-running battle against a rich banker, who sued them over the fit and layout of his \u00a312m One Hyde Park apartment, it was revealed they hired a private detective to pose as a middleman for the Saudi royal family to dig for dirt on their own customer. The case was settled with the disgruntled buyer collecting a multimillion payout.</p> <p>Their most high-profile court battle was against their former partners and backers, the Qatari royal family. They took legal action after the Qataris scrapped the Candys\u2019 plans for a \u00a33bn development of Chelsea Barracks after pressure from the Prince of&#xa0;Wales.</p> <p>It was revealed in court that during a face-to-face exchange over tea at Clarence House in 2009, Prince Charles had \u201cpissed in [the Qatari emir\u2019s] ear about how awful the [Lord Rogers-designed] scheme was\u201d. An email from Candy shortly after the meeting said the emir \u201cwent mental\u201d and told the boss of the Qatari Diar real estate firm to withdraw the designs as soon as possible.</p> <p>The Candys claimed the Qatari\u2019s change of heart over the design, due to \u201cdiplomatic and political reasons\u201d, had cost them \u00a381m. The judge ruled that Qatari Diar had breached the terms of the contract, but did not immediately award damages to Christian Candy\u2019s CPC Group.</p> <p>The case was eventually settled out of court with both sides able to claim some sort of victory \u2013 CPC group \u201capologised unreservedly\u201d to the Qatari royal family and Prince Charles, but walked away with an undisclosed sum.</p> <h2><strong>Potted profile</strong></h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>Nick Candy \u2013 23 January 1973; Christian Candy \u2013 31 July 1974, in Banstead, Surrey.</p> <p><strong>Education </strong>Both educated privately in Epsom.

The blaze tore through the gas-fired Didcot B plant on Sunday night. Its owner, RWE npower, had closed the site to stop the flames spreading. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, said National Grid had assured him there was no risk to energy supplies. A spokesman for his department went further by pledging there would be no supply crisis over the winter, with demand peaking in January. \u201cThe lights will not go out this winter. Up and down the country there are power stations on standby that can start pumping out power when needed, and the government has given National Grid the extra powers it needs to ensure there is enough electricity to keep the lights on,\u201d he said. But National Grid said the longer-term effect on supply was difficult to judge and that its annual winter outlook report, published next week, would take account of Didcot\u2019s reduced capacity. RWE npower said: \u201cThe affected part of the site will remain non-operational until an investigation and repairs can take place. It is too early to give any definitive estimate of how long this will be.\u201d Davey previously said Britain may have to use \u201clast resort\u201d measures to avoid winter blackouts in the next two years. The government is paying businesses to shut down at peak times so that there is enough energy for households. Industry analysts said Didcot B\u2019s reduced capacity would place further strain on the system if disruption continued into the winter months. Dorian Lucas, energy analyst at Inenco, said: \u201cOn top of existing closures this could result in a significantly tighter system leading into January where peak demand normally occurs.\u201d Didcot B is a 1.4GW power station that supplies power to about a million homes. The fire broke out in one of the site\u2019s two cooling towers. Firefighters brought the blaze under control without anyone being injured. Peter Atherton, energy analyst at Liberum Capital, said Britain had less spare capacity than would normally be expected for an advanced economy. \u201cThe loss of one unit at Didcot B reduces the UK\u2019s already meagre capacity to absorb supply shocks for this winter. Going into this winter, UK energy policy had reduced our ability to absorb unexpected events substantially.\u201d The fire at Didcot is the third at a fossil fuel-fired power station this year. After a blaze in February, E.ON decided not to bring back online one 370-MW unit at its Ironbridge power station in Shropshire. In July, two units at SSE\u2019s one-gigawatt (GW) Ferrybridge coal plant in West Yorkshire were shut after a fire broke out. EDF Energy also took two of its nuclear plants out of service in August for inspections after a fault was found.",

The first outlet is scheduled to open in Boston at the end of next year and Sears added further detail to Primark\u2019s expansion plan by telling investors that it had leased enough space for seven stores to the fashion chain as it looks to reduce the size of its more than 2,000-strong estate. More than 48,310 sq metres (520,000 sq ft) of space will be handed over to Primark over the next 12 to 18 months, Sears said.

Given the size of the Sears chain, analysts suggested the relationship could lead to further deals.

IBM - the world\u2019s largest technology services company - reported an unexpected 4% drop in third quarter revenues after it suffered a \u201cmarked slowdown\u201d in September.</p> <p>It will also pay $1.5bn for chipmaker Globalfoundries to take its semiconductor business off its hands.</p> <p>IBM shares lost around 7% on the news, helping drag the whole technology sector lower. In the UK chip designer <strong>Arm</strong> dropped 23.5p to 851.5p, ahead of results from Apple - one of its key customers - due after the market close.</p> <p>Overall the<strong> FTSE 100</strong> finished down 43.22 points or 0.68% at 6267.07. The early positive mood prompted by an overnight revival in Asian markets did not last, with the continuing concerns about a global slowdown and geopolitical problems such as the conflict in the Middle East and the spread of the Ebola virus soon coming back to the forefront of investors\u2019 minds.</p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s problems with its real time payment system crashing did not help matters.</p> <p>And there are some important economic figures out this week, including Chinese GDP, US inflation and eurozone manufacturing data, which could prompt more market volatility.</p> <p>Among the risers, <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> added 66p to \u00a326.35 after it signed a deal with US group Sears to lease space for seven standalone stores for its Primark brand, including one in the prestigious King of Prussia mall near Philadelphia. The move is part of Primark\u2019s plan to open 10 stores in the north east of the US in 2016. Credit Suisse issued an outperform rating on ABF, and analyst Charlie Mills said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sears refers in its statement to its on-going transformation to \u201cone of the largest real estate portfolios in the US over time\u201d. It is progressively moving from retailer to landlord.</p> <p>To put this in context Sears has over 2,000 stores in the US and can offer a huge amount of floor space to any would-be tenant. Teaming up with ABF/Primark would seem to open enormous possibilities down the line should Primark\u2019s foray in to the North East prove a success and a springboard into the rest of the US.</p> <p>This also confirms 2015/16 is lining up to be a bumper year for store openings for Primark, some 500,000 square feet here, on top of a busy European schedule as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tesco</strong> added 4.75p to 179.30p on hopes its results on Thursday will be no worse than anticipated after the discovery of a \u00a3250m black hole in its accounts, and amid reports of possible disposals to boost its balance sheet rather than a rights issue.</p> <p>But <strong>J Sainsbury</strong> fell 2.1p to 242.7p on talk it might be the one to ask shareholders for cash. Analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it looks as if Tesco will keep their powder dry on Thursday on the UK turnaround strategy and play down any rights issue plans, so will that tempt Sainsbury to have a rights issue on the back of its interims/strategy update on 12 November?</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere Russian steelmaker <strong>Evraz</strong> - part controlled by Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich - ended 3.4p lower at 125.3p after JP Morgan Cazenove cut its recommendation from neutral to underweight.<br></p> <p>But online gaming group <strong>Bwin.party digital</strong> added 4.4p to 92.9p after a buy note from Numis in the wake of a trading statement last week. Analyst Ivor Jones said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>bwin.party\u2019s capacity to \u201cpull itself up by its bootstraps\u201d could be just the investment case that investors are looking for in these turbulent markets. After years of frustration and disappointment there is bound to be scepticism, but the third quarter update showed signs of green shoots. Product upgrades are being developed and delivered more quickly, supporting growth where it matters, in sports, and in nationally regulated and/or taxed markets.</p> <p>We can see the attractions of giving priority to breaking up the group. However, maximising value depends on negotiating from a position of strength and recent management actions may be providing that strength. We believe the shares are priced for a continuation of the status quo. The most recent trading data however, suggests that things are beginning to change.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market, <strong>President Energy</strong> shook off the weak crude price and jumped 13p or 76% to 30p after it made an oil find which will allow it to start producing in Paraguay next year. It said it discovered oil nearly 4,000 metres underground, its first substantial find in the northern Chaco region.</p>",

It will also pay $1.5bn for chipmaker Globalfoundries to take its semiconductor business off its hands. IBM shares lost around 7% on the news, helping drag the whole technology sector lower. In the UK chip designer Arm dropped 23.5p to 851.5p, ahead of results from Apple - one of its key customers - due after the market close. Overall the FTSE 100 finished down 43.22 points or 0.68% at 6267.07. The early positive mood prompted by an overnight revival in Asian markets did not last, with the continuing concerns about a global slowdown and geopolitical problems such as the conflict in the Middle East and the spread of the Ebola virus soon coming back to the forefront of investors\u2019 minds. The Bank of England\u2019s problems with its real time payment system crashing did not help matters. And there are some important economic figures out this week, including Chinese GDP, US inflation and eurozone manufacturing data, which could prompt more market volatility. Among the risers, Associated British Foods added 66p to \u00a326.35 after it signed a deal with US group Sears to lease space for seven standalone stores for its Primark brand, including one in the prestigious King of Prussia mall near Philadelphia. The move is part of Primark\u2019s plan to open 10 stores in the north east of the US in 2016. Credit Suisse issued an outperform rating on ABF, and analyst Charlie Mills said: Sears refers in its statement to its on-going transformation to \u201cone of the largest real estate portfolios in the US over time\u201d. It is progressively moving from retailer to landlord. To put this in context Sears has over 2,000 stores in the US and can offer a huge amount of floor space to any would-be tenant. Teaming up with ABF/Primark would seem to open enormous possibilities down the line should Primark\u2019s foray in to the North East prove a success and a springboard into the rest of the US. This also confirms 2015/16 is lining up to be a bumper year for store openings for Primark, some 500,000 square feet here, on top of a busy European schedule as well. Tesco added 4.75p to 179.30p on hopes its results on Thursday will be no worse than anticipated after the discovery of a \u00a3250m black hole in its accounts, and amid reports of possible disposals to boost its balance sheet rather than a rights issue. But J Sainsbury fell 2.1p to 242.7p on talk it might be the one to ask shareholders for cash. Analyst Nick Bubb said: Well, it looks as if Tesco will keep their powder dry on Thursday on the UK turnaround strategy and play down any rights issue plans, so will that tempt Sainsbury to have a rights issue on the back of its interims/strategy update on 12 November? Elsewhere Russian steelmaker Evraz - part controlled by Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich - ended 3.4p lower at 125.3p after JP Morgan Cazenove cut its recommendation from neutral to underweight. But online gaming group Bwin.party digital added 4.4p to 92.9p after a buy note from Numis in the wake of a trading statement last week. Analyst Ivor Jones said: bwin.party\u2019s capacity to \u201cpull itself up by its bootstraps\u201d could be just the investment case that investors are looking for in these turbulent markets. After years of frustration and disappointment there is bound to be scepticism, but the third quarter update showed signs of green shoots. Product upgrades are being developed and delivered more quickly, supporting growth where it matters, in sports, and in nationally regulated and/or taxed markets. We can see the attractions of giving priority to breaking up the group. However, maximising value depends on negotiating from a position of strength and recent management actions may be providing that strength. We believe the shares are priced for a continuation of the status quo. The most recent trading data however, suggests that things are beginning to change. Lower down the market, President Energy shook off the weak crude price and jumped 13p or 76% to 30p after it made an oil find which will allow it to start producing in Paraguay next year. It said it discovered oil nearly 4,000 metres underground, its first substantial find in the northern Chaco region.",

      "bodyText": "I have been slow to home in on Thomas Piketty\u2019s book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, but it is hard to ignore the chatter that the book has generated from those on all sides of the political spectrum. The book sheds welcome light on the topic of income and wealth inequality and it has rekindled a debate in the United States and Europe on an age-old question: should we care if some individuals earn much more than others? As individuals in a modern democracy we make social decisions about how much of each good to produce and consume through free trade in a market economy. The rules by which we trade with others are determined through democratic elections in which we give power to our representatives to transfer resources from one human being to another. And we interact with each other through conversations, free association and social media or through more organised forms of persuasion such as newspapers and television stations. As economists, we are sometimes justly accused by other social scientists of taking a narrow view of human nature. A human being, to the neoclassical economist, is a preference ordering over all possible actions that he or she may take over the course of a lifetime. That preference ordering is fixed at birth and swings into action at the age of consent, at which time each of us exercises our endowed ability to choose among competing alternatives to maximise our happiness. That, of course, is poppycock. The view of homo-economicus as a utility seeking machine is not to be found in Smith, who had a much richer view of human nature as evidenced by his \u201cother book\u201d on The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Nor is it to be found in John Stuart Mill\u2019s eloquent defense of free speech in his essay On Liberty. Both of those eminent social scientists would, I am certain, have been open to the idea that our opinions are formed through rational argument with other human beings. Our preference orderings do determine our actions; but they are not preordained. Nature and nurture are equally important determinants of human action. Politics and economics are two parts of a theory of social democracy. There is a third component of social theory which Thomas Carlyle referred to as the fourth estate. In Carlyle\u2019s day that referred simply to the press. In the 21st century, it is any technology that promotes the spread of ideas. Elections are not simple horse races between differing opinions, they are heavily influenced by advertising paid for by political machines that raise money from competing interest groups. The New York Daily News reported, in 2013, that a US Senate seat now costs $10.5m (\u00a36.2m) to win. It is difficult for me to believe that this money is spent to endow potential voters with facts that they need in order to inform their own pre-existing preference orderings over outcomes. Money buys votes by shaping opinion. The power of money to influence elections suggests an answer to what is otherwise a perplexing question. Why are taxes on large estates currently set at such low rates? After all, we live in a democratic society in which the rules of the game are set by elected representatives in which every US citizen gets one vote. Further, as Piketty reminds us, 1% of the US population controls 30% of the wealth. Why don\u2019t the 99% choose to confiscate wealth from the richest 1%? The conservative answer to that question is that \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats\u201d. According to that argument, a confiscatory estate tax would result in lower growth and all of us would be worse off. It is difficult to know if that proposition is right or wrong but the evidence from Scandinavian social democracies suggests that it is at least debatable. And for a substantial period of time following the end of the second world war, growth did indeed benefit all parts of the income distribution. What Piketty has shown us, incontrovertibly I believe, is that since 1980 or thereabouts, it is only the rich and the very rich who have benefited from growth. The rise of democratic institutions in nineteenth century England was a response to the redistribution of wealth from landowners to the growing middle class that was created by the industrial revolution. Democracy was a safety valve that enabled the social cohesion necessary for everyone to thrive and it resulted in a massive redistribution of wealth from the landed aristocracy to the rest of society. That same safety valve will eventually lead to the enactment of a more comprehensive policy of redistribution as voters realise that there are limits to the argument that greed is good. One can make moral arguments for or against the redistribution of income and wealth but at the end of the day those arguments only matter if they are persuasive to the average voter. In a democratic society, the power of money to influence public opinion can perhaps hold back the tide for another decade. Maybe it can hold back public opinion for two or more decades. But there will come a time when the average American realises that the dream that his parents aspired to is no longer within his reach. And at that point, the enactment of a more comprehensive estate tax is inevitable. \u2022 Roger E. A.

      "body": "<p>As markets head south again, one of the biggest fallers is <strong>Just Eat</strong>.</p> <p>The online takeaway service which floated at 260p a share in April has fallen 11.4p to 264.2p after a cautious note from Peel Hunt. The broker said it expected the company\u2019s positive momentum to continue in the short term, but there were a number of issues in the longer term such as a pricing structure which is perhaps unsustainable and a vulnerable business model. Peel Hunt kept its hold recommendation but said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just Eat still offers the potential to be a highly profitable business, but investors need to enjoy the dish now before it gets cold.</p> <p>Structural opportunity. The emergence of online aggregator networks in the takeaway delivery market highlights a genuine online opportunity. We estimate that around 25% of takeaway food is currently ordered online, but by the end of the decade we expect this to grow to more than 50%. Just Eat has strong momentum, and in the race to grab land has the balance sheet to supplement dynamic organic growth with strategic acquisitions in its core markets.</p> <p>In the short term, we expect the rapid rate of expansion to continue; however...we have real concerns about the sustainability of the current pricing structure. This view is based on a number of factors, including high charges relative to limited intellectual property, questionable bottom-line value accretion for restaurants, and ultimately we see the aggregator model as a zero-sum game for the takeaway food industry. In addition, the takeaway aggregator business model as it currently stands compares unfavourably with other online platforms/distribution models, both from a B2B and B2C perspective. Therefore, this leaves Just Eat vulnerable to disruptive new business models.</p> <p>Land grab presents risks. There is a fierce land grab in the online takeaway aggregator market, with the four leading players all raising money in the last year. Comments from some of these players already point to more intense competition, while there is also a risk of over-paying for acquisitions.</p> <p>[The] risks [are] not reflected in valuation.

      "bodyText": "As markets head south again, one of the biggest fallers is Just Eat. The online takeaway service which floated at 260p a share in April has fallen 11.4p to 264.2p after a cautious note from Peel Hunt. The broker said it expected the company\u2019s positive momentum to continue in the short term, but there were a number of issues in the longer term such as a pricing structure which is perhaps unsustainable and a vulnerable business model. Peel Hunt kept its hold recommendation but said: Just Eat still offers the potential to be a highly profitable business, but investors need to enjoy the dish now before it gets cold. Structural opportunity. The emergence of online aggregator networks in the takeaway delivery market highlights a genuine online opportunity. We estimate that around 25% of takeaway food is currently ordered online, but by the end of the decade we expect this to grow to more than 50%. Just Eat has strong momentum, and in the race to grab land has the balance sheet to supplement dynamic organic growth with strategic acquisitions in its core markets. In the short term, we expect the rapid rate of expansion to continue; however...we have real concerns about the sustainability of the current pricing structure. This view is based on a number of factors, including high charges relative to limited intellectual property, questionable bottom-line value accretion for restaurants, and ultimately we see the aggregator model as a zero-sum game for the takeaway food industry. In addition, the takeaway aggregator business model as it currently stands compares unfavourably with other online platforms/distribution models, both from a B2B and B2C perspective. Therefore, this leaves Just Eat vulnerable to disruptive new business models. Land grab presents risks. There is a fierce land grab in the online takeaway aggregator market, with the four leading players all raising money in the last year. Comments from some of these players already point to more intense competition, while there is also a risk of over-paying for acquisitions. [The] risks [are] not reflected in valuation. In the short term our forecasts are broadly around consensus; however, from 2017 and beyond we are more cautious. Our base case discounted cash flow gives a fair value of 247p (165p for the established operations and 82p for emerging markets). Our bull case (407p) does give greater upside than our bear case (144p) downside, but given the long-term concerns it is insufficient for us to be more positive at this stage.",

      "bodyText": "The Vix volatily index - known popularly as the fear index - hit a near three-year high last week, reflecting the toxic cocktail of bad news which has sent stock markets tumbling. Investors are concerned about growing signs of a global economic slowdown, particularly in China and the eurozone, at the same time as major central banks such as the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are turning off the money taps which have supported stock markets for years. On top of that, geopolitical risks continue to dominate the headlines, with air strikes in the Middle East, protests in Hong Kong, and the spread of the Ebola virus. And judging by the volatility index, the uncertainty is not likely to end in the immediate future. Last week the Vix index hit 30 during the day for the first time since December 201, reflecting investor panic, before falling back from this peak as a hint of better economic news improved the mood slightly. But at the current level of around 22, it is still at a two year high. So what is the Vix? The Vix is calculated by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and measures market expectations of near-term volatility derived from prices paid for options on the US S&amp;P 500 index. After several research papers on the idea of a volatility index during the late 1980s and 1990s, the CBOE asked Vanderbilt University Professor Robert Whaley to develop a tradable index based on index option prices. So in 1993, the Vix was born, and investors have been using the index to hedge against severe market movements ever since. The index is not necessarily an indicator that investors believe the market will fall, but merely that it will move in one direction or another. The higher the index, the bigger the expected movement in the S&amp;P. And despite its recent rise, volatility is well below the levels seen at the time of the 2008 crash, when the index jumped as high at 80. The Vix is \u201cnot at a crazy worry we\u2019re going into a bear market by any stretch,\u201d Randy Frederick of Charles Schwab told CNBC last week. The index is calculated as the expected movement in the S&amp;P 500 over the next 30 days, assuming a 68% likelihood or one standard deviation, which is then annualised. So if the Vix is at 30, that indicates the S&amp;P is expected to move up or down by 30 divided by the square root of 12, or up to 8.6% over the next 30 days.",

      "body": "<p>The global economy at the moment is really not made for glass half full types. After 20 years of \u201c<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moderation\">the great moderation</a>\u201d where consistent economic growth seemed to be a normal state of affairs, since the GFC, any bit of good news is quickly stomped on by the reality of bad economic data and the realisation that the years of solid, strong growth are unlikely to return soon. </p> <p>Just a week after I tried to put at least a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/oct/09/beyond-the-headlines-about-economic-growth-its-not-all-gloom-and-doom\">pleasant sort of shine</a> on the latest economic growth downgrades by the IMF, we saw the Eurozone have massive conniptions. The IMF downgrades were already enough to bring out the gloom merchants, but when last week Eurostat reported that the Eurozone annual inflation rate was a mere 0.3%, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2014/oct/14/nervous-markets-await-eurozone-data-and-uk-inflation-business-live#block-543d1256e4b0486a79be3541\">German economic ministry downgraded</a> its own growth forecasts, stock markets around Europe saw large falls. </p> <p>It says something about the dire state of the Eurozone that the good news of last week was <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/17/uk-eurozone-economy-gdp-idUKKCN0I611I20141017\">Eurostat</a> revising up its estimate of growth for the first quarter of this year from a pathetic 0.2% to a merely miserable 0.3%. </p> <p>And that was about all the good news there was, for as gloomy as the IMF had been last week, it seems they were not gloomy enough. The IMF, in its latest World Economic Outlook report, downgraded Germany\u2019s GDP growth for this year from the 1.7% it expected in April to just 1.3%. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/9moRK/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But on Wednesday, Germany announced that even that figure was too rosy and it expected to grow by just 1.2% both this year and in 2015.</p> <p>When the IMF downgraded the whole Eurozone\u2019s expected growth for 2014 from 1.2% to 0.8%, it made no bones about why. It explained that the \u201cstagnant euro area growth\u201d was due to \u201can output contraction in Italy, no growth in France, and unexpected weakness in Germany in the second quarter\u201d. It concluded, \u201cthe outlook is for a modest recovery and subdued inflation.\u201d</p> <p>And given German industrial production in August fell 4% in one month, and coming off the back of Germany\u2019s economy shrinking in the first quarter of 2013, the whispers of recessions are quickly becoming loud. </p> <p>So the markets were already primed to fall and from the middle of September till Wednesday last week the German stock market index had fallen 9.9%. And then, after the growth downgrade, it fell 2.8% in one day. The impact was felt around Europe with the London stock market falling by the same amount and the French market down by 3.6%.</p> <p>All three recovered somewhat on Friday, but in the past month the FTSE100 in London has fallen 6.9%, the German DAX Index has lost 8.1% and the French CAC40 has seen 8.98% of its value gone. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Ok7Uz/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The inflation figure is in some ways the talisman. Inflation growth of just 0.3% highlights just how little demand there is for goods and services in Europe. The spectre of deflation \u2013 where prices on average fall \u2013 has been haunting Europe for a while and without some major stimulus it looks set to stay. </p> <p>The problem, as with all things in the Eurozone, is to do with the Euro itself. The mechanisms which might see either member countries indulge in stimulatory spending or the ECB begin quantitative easing as has been done by the Federal Reserve, where essentially the central bank puts more money into the system by buying bonds, are constrained by the rules that keep all countries within the Euro system. </p> <p>So tied up in legality are these rules that the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing style policy in 2012 is currently being <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonhartley/2014/10/14/legality-of-ecb-quantitative-easing-challenged-by-germany-at-top-eu-court/\">challenged in European Court of Justice</a>. </p> <p>The main concern for most is that the German government, despite its economy displaying all the symptoms of a recession, remains steadfast in its belief that austerity and budget tightening remains the best approach. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/UepBD/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So the situation is pretty bleak, but where does this leave Australia? Are we destined to be dragged down into the economic malaise on the other side of the globe? </p> <p>The good news is Australia is not directly affected much by Europe.</p> <p>The Eurozone did once account for up to 7% of Australia\u2019s exports, but that was back in 2007; now it is closer to 3%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/j68me/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Similarly, a decade ago the EU bought around 12-14% of our exports; now it gets just 4%. That is mostly due to the increasing amount of exports China gets from us, but since 2007 exports to the EU have actually fallen by a third, whereas exports to China have increased by around 320%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph6\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/wn0Wo/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Eurozone altogether now takes about as many exports from us as New Zealand does by itself.

      "bodyText": "The global economy at the moment is really not made for glass half full types. After 20 years of \u201cthe great moderation\u201d where consistent economic growth seemed to be a normal state of affairs, since the GFC, any bit of good news is quickly stomped on by the reality of bad economic data and the realisation that the years of solid, strong growth are unlikely to return soon. Just a week after I tried to put at least a pleasant sort of shine on the latest economic growth downgrades by the IMF, we saw the Eurozone have massive conniptions. The IMF downgrades were already enough to bring out the gloom merchants, but when last week Eurostat reported that the Eurozone annual inflation rate was a mere 0.3%, and the German economic ministry downgraded its own growth forecasts, stock markets around Europe saw large falls. It says something about the dire state of the Eurozone that the good news of last week was Eurostat revising up its estimate of growth for the first quarter of this year from a pathetic 0.2% to a merely miserable 0.3%. And that was about all the good news there was, for as gloomy as the IMF had been last week, it seems they were not gloomy enough. The IMF, in its latest World Economic Outlook report, downgraded Germany\u2019s GDP growth for this year from the 1.7% it expected in April to just 1.3%. But on Wednesday, Germany announced that even that figure was too rosy and it expected to grow by just 1.2% both this year and in 2015. When the IMF downgraded the whole Eurozone\u2019s expected growth for 2014 from 1.2% to 0.8%, it made no bones about why. It explained that the \u201cstagnant euro area growth\u201d was due to \u201can output contraction in Italy, no growth in France, and unexpected weakness in Germany in the second quarter\u201d. It concluded, \u201cthe outlook is for a modest recovery and subdued inflation.\u201d And given German industrial production in August fell 4% in one month, and coming off the back of Germany\u2019s economy shrinking in the first quarter of 2013, the whispers of recessions are quickly becoming loud. So the markets were already primed to fall and from the middle of September till Wednesday last week the German stock market index had fallen 9.9%. And then, after the growth downgrade, it fell 2.8% in one day. The impact was felt around Europe with the London stock market falling by the same amount and the French market down by 3.6%. All three recovered somewhat on Friday, but in the past month the FTSE100 in London has fallen 6.9%, the German DAX Index has lost 8.1% and the French CAC40 has seen 8.98% of its value gone. The inflation figure is in some ways the talisman. Inflation growth of just 0.3% highlights just how little demand there is for goods and services in Europe. The spectre of deflation \u2013 where prices on average fall \u2013 has been haunting Europe for a while and without some major stimulus it looks set to stay. The problem, as with all things in the Eurozone, is to do with the Euro itself. The mechanisms which might see either member countries indulge in stimulatory spending or the ECB begin quantitative easing as has been done by the Federal Reserve, where essentially the central bank puts more money into the system by buying bonds, are constrained by the rules that keep all countries within the Euro system. So tied up in legality are these rules that the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing style policy in 2012 is currently being challenged in European Court of Justice. The main concern for most is that the German government, despite its economy displaying all the symptoms of a recession, remains steadfast in its belief that austerity and budget tightening remains the best approach. So the situation is pretty bleak, but where does this leave Australia? Are we destined to be dragged down into the economic malaise on the other side of the globe? The good news is Australia is not directly affected much by Europe. The Eurozone did once account for up to 7% of Australia\u2019s exports, but that was back in 2007; now it is closer to 3%: Similarly, a decade ago the EU bought around 12-14% of our exports; now it gets just 4%. That is mostly due to the increasing amount of exports China gets from us, but since 2007 exports to the EU have actually fallen by a third, whereas exports to China have increased by around 320%: The Eurozone altogether now takes about as many exports from us as New Zealand does by itself. So in comparison to China and Japan it is not very important, but it is still sizeable. Where Australia will worry is with the secondary impacts. The EU economy is roughly the same size as the United States. When something that big hits the wall, it has reverberations. For Australia the biggest worry is Chinese exports \u2013 not ours to them, but China\u2019s to the EU. The EU is China\u2019s biggest export destination, just ahead of US: Given China\u2019s doldrums of its own with slumping housing prices and less than stellar industrial production, analysts were hoping that Chinese growth may come from exports. Indeed last week it was reported that China\u2019s exports rose 15.3% in the past year. And Bloomberg suggested that the latest \u201ciPhone may boost China\u2019s exports by about 1% a month for the rest of 2014\u201d. So while China\u2019s exports are holding there are less fears about the ripple from Europe hitting China and then in turn hitting us. But the longer the malaise in Europe lasts, the more likely it will start hitting China\u2019s exports and then in turn their need to import minerals from us in order to make things to send to Europe. The dire straits of the Eurozone also further reinforces the \u201cnew normal\u201d of the world economy where growth is weak and fragile. News from the US last week suggests its recovery was not as strong as hoped. Metal prices remain lower than was expected in the May budget and thus company tax revenue is likely to be lower than anticipated. It is why in the past month the market has gone from predicting a possible interest rate rise next year to now suggesting a 50% chance of a rate cut by September 2015: A weak European economy might not need to scare Australians, but it just is one more piece of ammunition for those who would suggest that after 20 years of \u201cthe great moderation\u201d we\u2019re now in the period of the great mediocre.",
