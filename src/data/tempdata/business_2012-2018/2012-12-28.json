From 2015, the aim should be to reduce public debt by 5 percent a year to bring debt down to 60 percent of gross domestic product from over 126 percent at present. A constitutional balanced budget amendment should be respected and the sale of state assets continued.</p> <h2>TAX AND SPENDING</h2> <p>The overall tax level should be reduced, the burden of which should be shifted from jobs and companies to large fortunes and consumption which does not hurt the middle classes and the poor.</p> <p>Waste should be cut and public spending better targeted with permanent oversight to improve the efficiency of public administration. There should be zero tolerance for tax evasion.</p> <h2>LABOUR MARKETS</h2> <p>Labour market rules should be simplified and the so-called \"dual system\" that divides workers with secure long-term contracts from those on part-time or short-term contracts with few rights broken down.</p> <p>There should be more wage bargaining at individual company level, with more emphasis on productivity deals.</p> <p>Tax measures to get more women and young people into workforce should be enacted as well as measures to keep people over 55 years of age in work.</p> <h2>JUSTICE</h2> <p>Rules on corporate fraud should be beefed up and anti-corruption and money laundering legislation extended. The statute of limitations should be extended in some cases to make it easier for courts to fight serious crime. Tougher rules on conflict of interests are needed.</p> <h2>INSTITUTIONAL REFORM</h2> <p>The much-criticised electoral law that does not allow the electorate to vote for individual members of parliament should be overhauled, the number of parliamentarians cut, the influence of lobby groups reduced, and state funding of political parties cut.</p> <h2>INDUSTRY, INVESTMENT</h2> <p>More should be done to attract foreign direct investment with the aim of matching the European average level, companies helped to gain access to credit, and a new industrial restructuring fund created.</p> <h2>LIBERALISATION</h2> <p>Protected industries should be opened up to more competition.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50ddfb9f95cb94a7be21b4c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p

Ever since prosecutors have been earnestly studying whether it differs from the original handed to Papaconstantinou in April 2010.</p> <p>But with Papaconstantinou adamantly denying making any changes to the list, Greek prosecutors are being cautious. Helena adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In&#xa0;the shrill climate that prevails in Greece, where calls for justice ring ever louder among a population blaming their country's financial mess almost exclusively on the wrongdoing of politicians,&#xa0;prosecutors are also cautioning against a witch-hunt - one in which&#xa0;Papaconstantinou, who has stringently denied any suggestion that he tempered with the list, would be an easy victim.</p> <p>The latest list reportedly contains the names of 2,062 individuals according to prosecutors who will study whether any of the depositors actively evaded taxes. The new list will be presented to parliament once it has been handed over to the ministry of justice, the paper says.</p> </blockquote> <p>The reports have caused quite a storm on Twitter.

So far the official numbers have not fully encapsulated this but perhaps today's downwards revision for 2011&#xa0;will be followed by others for 2012. The downwards spiral was caused by a boom and then&#xa0;bust in both her housing and banking markets which if the latest data is any guide are still developing. It appears that credit to other parts of the economy are being reduced too which is not a good sign either.</p> <p>One bright spot is her balance of payments performance which has improved through this crisis and in July was positive for the first time in the Euro era. The trouble is that whilst there has been an export improvement this also represents a fall in imports due to economic weakness.</p> <p>Also we see that in terms of bond yields they have retreated from the highs of the middle of this year and her benchmark ten-year is now far from where it began 2012 at 5.28%.

      "bodyText": "PS: there's no progress on the Fiscal Cliff yet, and the Dow Jones industrial average just closed down 1.2% or 158 points, at 12,937. Goodnight, and thanks. GW Time to wrap things up for the day, and the week (but not the year!). Here's a full summary of a day that started slowly, but was quite dramatic by the end. \u2022 Mario Monti has launched a bid to be elected as Italy's prime minister. The outgoing technocratic leader is to head up a new coalition who will back his reform agenda, and has pledged to shake up traditional politics. The move, announced tonight, ends weeks of speculation over Monti's future. It also adds a fascinating twist to next February's election. We have details of Monti's announcement from 6.51am, reaction at 7.14pm, photos at 7.25pm, and details of his agenda at 8.14pm. \u2022 Greece's former finance minister has been dragged into the Lagarde List controversy. George Papaconstantinou denied deleting the names of three family members from the list of Greeks with Swiss bank accounts ( see 2.47pm and 2.03pm), but was tonight cold-shouldered by his Pasok party (see 4.41pm) \u2022 France's economy is even weaker than feared. New GDP data showed it grew by only 0.1% in the third quarter of 2012, which means it has been effectively stagnant for the last year (see 8.37am onwards) \u2022 Spain's prime minister has defended his austerity programme, and warned of more pain ahead. Mariano Rajoy said the first six months of 2013 will be particularly taxing, but insisted that he does not plan to apply for a bailout (see 1.01pm onwards). \u2022 ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny joined the chorus of key players predicting a calmer 12 months. (see 11.28am) \u2022 Fears over the US fiscal cliff have hit Europe again. Stock markets fell again (see 5.41pm), while negotiations in Washington will continue into the evening (details at 5.53pm) And here's some reaction to the news from the best fake account on Twitter*: * - in my humble opinion, m'lud Mario Monti's reform agenda is online here: www.agenda-monti.it/ It's a mixture of economic liberalisation, fiscal consolidation and pro-European policies, alongside commitments to clean up Italian society Reuters has helpfully summarised the key points: EUROPE Italy must push for growth policies based on sound public finances, develop a more integrated and dynamic single market, and try to get European Union member states to share more financial risks between them. In return, Italy must respect its own budget commitments and follow the guidelines agreed with European partners as the basis for its own economic policies. PUBLIC FINANCE Growth is only possible on the basis of sound public finances. From 2015, the aim should be to reduce public debt by 5 percent a year to bring debt down to 60 percent of gross domestic product from over 126 percent at present. A constitutional balanced budget amendment should be respected and the sale of state assets continued. TAX AND SPENDING The overall tax level should be reduced, the burden of which should be shifted from jobs and companies to large fortunes and consumption which does not hurt the middle classes and the poor. Waste should be cut and public spending better targeted with permanent oversight to improve the efficiency of public administration. There should be zero tolerance for tax evasion. LABOUR MARKETS Labour market rules should be simplified and the so-called \"dual system\" that divides workers with secure long-term contracts from those on part-time or short-term contracts with few rights broken down. There should be more wage bargaining at individual company level, with more emphasis on productivity deals. Tax measures to get more women and young people into workforce should be enacted as well as measures to keep people over 55 years of age in work. JUSTICE Rules on corporate fraud should be beefed up and anti-corruption and money laundering legislation extended. The statute of limitations should be extended in some cases to make it easier for courts to fight serious crime. Tougher rules on conflict of interests are needed. INSTITUTIONAL REFORM The much-criticised electoral law that does not allow the electorate to vote for individual members of parliament should be overhauled, the number of parliamentarians cut, the influence of lobby groups reduced, and state funding of political parties cut. INDUSTRY, INVESTMENT More should be done to attract foreign direct investment with the aim of matching the European average level, companies helped to gain access to credit, and a new industrial restructuring fund created. LIBERALISATION Protected industries should be opened up to more competition. Back in the UK, and my colleagues have pulled together another corking set of articles on Britain's future in Europe. They include: \u2022 Lord Mandelson warning that the European Union faces a decade of further unpopularity and challenges to its legitimacy, as austerity drags on. \u2022 A group of veteran politicians, including Lords Heseltine and Brittan, have revealed their hopes ahead of a landmark speech on Europe from David Cameron \u2022 Mats Persson, director of the Open Europe thinktank, on Britain's options if it leaves the EU Italian news agency ANSA has billed Monti's announcement as the \"birth of new Italian political coalition\". ANSA also explains how the move came about: The caretaker premier, who will oversee ordinary government administration until the new one takes over, met with centrist Catholic UDC party leader Pier Ferdinando Casini, representatives of the Italia Futura political movement, and Andrea Riccardi, a minister in his technocrat emergency government today. Just in, photos of Mario Monti announcing his plans in Rome tonight (see 6.51pm onwards for the details) Mario Monti's decision to run as an full-blown prime ministerial candidate has surprised experts and commentators. The immediate reaction is that this new centist coalition will not win February's election. But, with two months to go, who knows? Here's some early reaction and analysis: Hers are the key quotes from Monti, hot off the Reuters terminal: \"The traditional left-right split has historic and symbolic value\" for the country, but \"it does not highlight the real alliance that Italy needs - one that focuses on Europe and reforms,\" Monti said after a meeting with centrist politicians. He said he was willing to accept \"being named as leader of the coalition\". As 'senator for life', Mario Monti cannot run for a seat in the lower house of the Italian parliament (the Chamber of Deputies) But tonight's announcement certainly means that Monti is in the running to be prime minister. The crucial point, as Italian political expert Alberto Nardelli explains to me, is that candidates from centrist parties will be on ballot paper under his name. Breaking News: Mario Monti has decided to lead a group of centrist parties into next year's Italian general election. After weeks of speculation, and negotiations with various parties, Monti has decided to create a new political group. Speaking in Italy now, the technocratic PM said he will oversee the creation of a coalition of centrist parties. They will run under his reform programme - Agenda Monti - for seats in both the lower house of parliament and the senate. This means Monti will be named as an official Prime Ministerial candidate on the 'lists' which voters will choose from. Monti declared that his new centrist coalition can achieve \"Significant results\", although Italy's left-leaning Democratic Party, led by Pier Luigi Bersani, holds a solid lead in the opinion polls. More to follow! The UK's Europe minister has called for a settlement with the rest of Europe that leaves Britons \"comfortable\" with their place in the EU. In the latest part of the Guardian's series on the 40th anniversary of Britain joining the EEC, David Lidington insisted London could hammer out a new settlement. He said: While we could survive outside, that would not be the best outcome for British interests, either economic or political. Lidingon rejected Herman Van Rompuy's warning yesterday that the UK can't simply \"cherry-pick\" the bits of Europe it fancies, saying: \"I give a certain amount of short shrift to some of the charges of cherry-picking. I say: 'Hang on, why is it that we have a single market in services that is very far from complete? Why no single market in transport yet?' The full story, by Nicholas Watt and Patrick Wintour, is here: Any EU deal must make Britons feel comfortable, says Europe minister Van Rompuy's comments have caused quite a stir, and even former EC president Jacques Delors has weighed in. As the Daily Telegraph's Bruno Waterfield reports: The former European Commission president, who is credited as the architect of the modern EU and the euro, has broken ranks with other European leaders to offer Britain an exit from the Union. \"The British are solely concerned about their economic interests, nothing else. They could be offered a different form of partnership,\" he told Handelsblatt, a German financial newspaper. \"If the British cannot support the trend towards more integration in Europe, we can nevertheless remain friends, but on a different basis. I could imagine a form such as a European economic area or a free-trade agreement.\" More here: Jacques Delors: Britain could leave the European Union Also... my US colleagues will be taking questions over Twitter any moment, at our @GuardianUS account. I'm assured that a double helping of awesomeness is on the menu: The US Fiscal Cliff will be the big story of tonight, with Barack Obama scheduled to hold a press conference at 8pm GMT (or 3pm Washington time). As our Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe reports, the president and senior senators are making one last effort to reach a breakthrough: Obama pushes for fiscal cliff breakthrough in White House talks And Richard Adams is masterfully blogging the latest details here: Fiscal cliff: Obama holds summit with congressional leaders - live. One last development on the George Papaconstantinou/Lagarde List row: Europe's stock markets have closed, many for the last time in 2012. Closing prices: FTSE 100: down 28 points at 5925, -0.5% German DAX: down 43 points at 7612, - 0.57% French CAC: down 54 points at 3620, - 1.5% Spanish IBEX: down 149 points at 8131, - 1.8% FTSE MIB: down 134 points at 16273, - 0.8% That pesky US fiscal cliff continues to take the blame, amid rumours that Barack Obama is proposing a last-ditch 'mini-deal' to ward off the imminent spending cuts and expiring tax exemption that await America once 2013 begins.... And Reuters is now quoting unnamed Athens court officials who confirm that the names of three Papaconstantinou relatives appear to have been removed from the Lagarde List: Greek tax cheats list altered to hide names -court sources That doesn't prove that the ex-finance minister was involved, of course. More developments in Greece tonight: George Papaconstantinou has been dropped from the Pasok party following today's allegations - which he denies - that he removed relatives' details from the Lagarde List. In a statement, the junior coalition party said: It is regrettable that according to the prosecutors' investigation there are clear indications that the list has been tampered with... there is, therefore, a major issue regarding the responsibility of Giorgos Papaconstantinou since he is the one who handled the issue in the worst possible way and after two years declared he had lost the original CD... It is clear that Mr Papaconstantinou no longer belongs to PASOK. (that's via Kathimerini). Papaconstantinou was succeeded as finance minister by Evangelos Venizelos, who is now Pasok's leader and has also been criticised for the way the list (of Greek account holders at HSBC's Swiss arm). Here's a handy flowchart showing how Mario Monti could stay on as Italy's PM following next February's election: Monti's plans are still unknown, though, as talks with potential coalition partners continue. Back in the financial markets....the US fiscal cliff drop is driving down shares again. The Dow Jones has dropped 100 points in early trading, while the main European indices are also in the red. George Papaconstantinou has now issued an official vehement denial of any wrongdoing regarding the Lagarde List (see 2.03pm onwards). The rebuttal came in a stern statement sent out from his political office. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: In a full page statement the former finance minister denounces as \"appalling\" the process of leaks and descriptions of names that have taken place in the last few hours. \"I categorically declare that I had and have no relationship with any account on the list,\" he says. The full statement is online here. Papaconstantinou said he was \"categorically\" certain that he has no link to any account on the list of alleged tax evaders, adding that he had played an important role in obtaining the list in the first place. The former finance minister added: I ask that all the information comes to light and for a full investigation to take place. Back to Greece, and our correspondent Helena Smith has full details of the allegations that broke today against former finance minister George Papaconstantinou, related to the list of alleged tax evaders (see also 12.42pm) Helena writes: Drama has erupted over revelations, now being made by the leading Greek daily Ta Nea, that the three names linked to former finance minister George Papaconstantinou in the famous Lagarde list are in fact relatives he allegedly sought to protect. The three have been named as the two daughters of his politician uncle, the late Michalis Papaconstantinou, and one of their husbands with Ta Nea describing the account of at least one of the holders at the Geneva branch of HSBC as containing $US 1.222.000. \"These individuals, who had been dropped from the [original] list, allegedly held two accounts one of which included $US 1.222.000 while the movement of sums on the other [account] do not appear as it was a closed [account]. This is what emerged from the comparison of the two lists as a result of the investigation by the economic prosecutors Grigoris Peponis and Spyros Mousakitis,\" Ta Nea wrote on its website. As reported earlier, the new list arrived in cinematographic fashion in Athens a few days before Christmas. Ever since prosecutors have been earnestly studying whether it differs from the original handed to Papaconstantinou in April 2010. But with Papaconstantinou adamantly denying making any changes to the list, Greek prosecutors are being cautious. Helena adds: In the shrill climate that prevails in Greece, where calls for justice ring ever louder among a population blaming their country's financial mess almost exclusively on the wrongdoing of politicians, prosecutors are also cautioning against a witch-hunt - one in which Papaconstantinou, who has stringently denied any suggestion that he tempered with the list, would be an easy victim. The latest list reportedly contains the names of 2,062 individuals according to prosecutors who will study whether any of the depositors actively evaded taxes. The new list will be presented to parliament once it has been handed over to the ministry of justice, the paper says. The reports have caused quite a storm on Twitter. And as the WSJ's Matina Stevis explains, they have the potential to rock Brussels too. Rajoy went on to defend his austerity programme, claiming Spain would be in an \"immeasurably worse situation\" without it. The priority now, he says, is to lay foundations for improving the economy in future. Here's Rajoy's full quote on the bailout issue: We are not thinking of asking the European Central Bank to intervene and buy bonds in the secondary market...But we can't rule it out in the future. Mariano Rajoy went on to credit the European Central Bank for calming the markets, through its offer of an unlimited bond buying programme to countries in distress. But he also reiterated that he does not expect to apply for a bailout, thus triggering ECB action. Spain will ask for help if needed, though, he added. That confidence reflects the recent drop in Spain's borrowing costs since the summer, when the ECB's Mario Draghi made his move. Spanish Prime minister Mariano Rajoy is giving his end-of-year press conference now. Rajoy began by saying that 2012 has been a tumultuous year, but one that is ending with some calm in the financial markets. He then warned that 2013 will be tough -- particularly the first half of the year as the ongoing recession continues to bite. After his first full year in office, Rajoy pinned the blame for the economic crisis on his predecessors. Things have been more difficult than we expected. And while austerity has been very unpopular, Rajoy argued that his tough policies are \"starting to pay off\". he added: I will not ask for patience...or [or] blind faith, but understanding and solidarity. There are reports in Greece that former finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, is implicated on the 'Lagarde List' of suspected tax evaders. Local media are claiming that three names \"linked\" to Papaconstantinou appear on the new version of the list obtained by the Greek government this month. However, they apparently do not appear on the version that came to light recently after being originally mislaid. Papaconstantinou, who was finance minister when Christine Lagarde handed over the list, has robustly denied the suggestion that he manipulated the list in any way. More to follow! Over in Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith says the architect of Greece\u2019s admittance into the eurozone has ended the year with a damning indictment of the single currency bloc. Helena writes: Greece\u2019s former prime minister Kostas Simitis, who oversaw the country\u2019s entrance to the euro zone in 2001, slammed what he described as the \u201cstructural flaws\u201d of the euro zone in an article published in today's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Electing to use the prominent German daily to make the point that it was wrong to single out Greece as the sole instigator of the worst economic crisis to befall Europe since the Second World War, the German-educated erstwhile socialist leader said the entire architecture of the euro zone had to change. The founders of monetary union, he charged, had wrongfully believed that banks would automatically stop lending to euro zone states that had become overly indebted. \u201cTrust in the power of the market to regulate everything was overly excessive,\u201d he wrote. A permanent solution to the crisis could only come \u201cthrough deeper economic and political union,\u201d said Simitis, a revered moderniser in his time even if Greece was later exposed to have cooked the books to get into the cherished common currency bloc. Reality, he argued, was now pressing for \u201ca mutual contribution [to solving the crisis], the extent of which can not be foreseen only by legal texts.\u201d The biting commentary from one of Greece's leading Europeanists will add fuel to the argument that Berlin will ultimately have to change tune if the euro zone is ever to properly function. While we wait for Mariano Rajoy's press conference.... economist Shaun Richards flags up that Spain's GDP data for 2011 has been revised down today. He fears that Spain will continue to suffer in 2013: It is plain that the beat goes on in Spain and that the drums are beating a depressionary rhythm. So far the official numbers have not fully encapsulated this but perhaps today's downwards revision for 2011 will be followed by others for 2012. The downwards spiral was caused by a boom and then bust in both her housing and banking markets which if the latest data is any guide are still developing. It appears that credit to other parts of the economy are being reduced too which is not a good sign either. One bright spot is her balance of payments performance which has improved through this crisis and in July was positive for the first time in the Euro era. The trouble is that whilst there has been an export improvement this also represents a fall in imports due to economic weakness. Also we see that in terms of bond yields they have retreated from the highs of the middle of this year and her benchmark ten-year is now far from where it began 2012 at 5.28%. The problem is that as problems and debts continue to build this is still much too high. So we see that the problems of 2012 for Spain\u2019s economy look set to carry on into 2013 with no respite in sight. In a country with an unemployment rate already at 25.02% as of the official numbers for the third quarter that is a prospect beyond chilling which sends a shiver down the spine. Unemployment of 5,778,100 is already far too high. More here: What is happening in Spain\u2019s economy and what is the outlook for 2013? Heads-up: Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is due to give his end of year press conference this lunchtime (probably around 1.30pm local time, or 12.30pm GMT). In the meantime, the Spanish stock market is losing ground - with the IBEX 35 now down 1.6%. Bankia has tumbled another 25%, following yesterday's news that existing shareholders will lose almost all their stakes when it is recapitalised. European Central Bank policy maker Ewald Nowotny has joined the ranks of eurozone players predicting that 2013 will be a calmer year. Nowotny, the governor of Austria's central bank, said that eurozone leaders had made real progress in 2012. He cited the agreement on eurozone banking supervision, the decision to hand Greece its loan tranche this month, and the creation of the permanent bailout fund. Altogether these are important measures that allow for cautious optimism for a way out of the crisis in 2013. This follows Germany finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble's, prediction that the worst is over for the eurocrisis.... Speaking of which, Reuters has rounded up the experts* whose predictions of a disaster in 2012 didn't come true: Euro doomsayers adjust predictions after 2012 apocalypse averted. * Paul Krugman, Nouriel Roubini and Willem Buiter all get namechecked One piece of good news this morning -- capital is flowing back into Spain's banking sector, as fears over the break-up of the eurozone subside. The Bank of Spain reported a capital inflow of \u20ac12.1bn for October, the second month running in which more money moved into the Spanish banking sector than out of it. It follows Mario Draghi's famous pledge to defend the euro at all costs -- but analysts caution against getting too excited. As Martin van Vliet, senior economist at ING, told Reuters: This confirms that ever since Draghi said he would do whatever it takes to save the euro, the capital flight has stopped and partially reversed... It's a positive development...but Spain is not out of the woods yet and the situation can change overnight. Over to Italy, where the Treasury has just raised \u20ac5.87bn through an auction of long-term bonds. The cost of borrowing was the highest since October -- 10-year bonds were sold at a yield of 4.48%, from 4.45%. But there's nothing too alarming here really - and no suggestion that the impending election is alarming the bond market. World First's chief economist, Jeremy Cook, certainly isn't panicking: Rather like an overstuffed Christmas diner, the UK stock market is struggling to move this morning. The FTSE 100 is currently down just 0.37 points, somewhat to the chagrin of those who made the trip into the City: Other European markets have fallen: German DAX: down 9 points at 7646 French CAC: down 13 points at 0.36% Spanish IBEX: down 79 points at 8201, - 0.1% Italian FTSE MIB: down 51 points at 16356, - 0.3% Speaking of Japan, its Nikkei share index hit another 21-month high on its final trading day of 2012. Traders are buying shares in anticipation of a huge injection of stimulus by the Bank of Japan. The NIkkei finished 72 points higher at 10,395, and analysts reckon it will break through 11,000 by early February. Still some way shy of its lifetime peak of over 38,900 in 1989.... Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, is concerned by France's weak growth (see 8.37am) and Japan's shrinking industrial output (see 9.18am). He writes: Japan is stuck with deflation, Europe is stuck with recession. French Q3 GDP is flat y/y, which makes for a stagnant core and shrinking edges to the Euro Zone. With a Dickensian flourish, Kit argues that Japan could be the Marley to Europe's Scrooge: Europe has much to learn from Japan's woes. And indeed, if Europe wants to see more growth and a lower debt level than Japan has seen in the 23 years since the Nikkei peaked, they'd better get learning. Don't expect your currency to be weak just because your economy is, is one lesson. The correlation between the euro's value and peripheral bond spreads tells us the euro does well whenever the Euro-crisis is put on the back-burner, as is now the case. But a strong euro is no more reason to cheer than a strong yen. The ghost of Christmas yet to come can be seen by Eurocrats any time they want to brush up on modern Japanese economic history. Act now or deflate at your peril. The consequences of Europe's weak economy continue to be felt in Japan, where industrial output has slipped again. Industrial production in the world's third-largest economy fell by 1.7% in November, compared with a year ago. It adds impetus to new prime minister Shinzo Abe's plans for a stimulus package and looser economic policies. But with Japan already in recession and battling deflation, it's another reason to be downbeat about 2013. Hot on the heels of France's updated GDP data comes another fall in Spanish retail sales. Retail sales across Spain slumped 7.8% in November, compared with a year earlier. That's the 29th monthly fall in a row. Spanish retailers have already admitted that Christmas did not go well, as the public suffered from the recession, austerity cut backs and tax rises. Ainhoa Garcia, spokeswoman for the Spanish Commerce Confederation, told Reuters yesterday: The Christmas campaign didn't take off the way it was expected to and we know sales are down compared to 2011 though we don't have the figures yet. Good morning, and welcome to another day of rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other events across the world economy. We start with some disappointing news for France. New GDP data released this morning showed that its economy barely grew in the third quarter of 2012. GDP increased by a paltry 0.1%, not the +0.2% first estimated. The revision means France economy failed to post any growth at all over the last 12 months, and reinforces the fact that the eurozone itself is in a double-dip recession (as covered here last month). The weak performance was driven by a drop in imports (which fell by 0.5%) and business investment (-0.6%). That suggests French firms were hunkering down during the early months of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's presidency. The data comes hours after the latest jobless data showed that the number of people out of work in France has risen for the 19th month in a row, to its highest level in nearly 15 years. The French unemployment total rose by 29,300 in November, to 3.13 million. France's unemployment rate is already 10.3%, rather worse than the UK, Germany or the US -- but still below the eurozone average. So while the worst of the crisis may be abating, Europe's economy remains troubled. And with America's fiscal cliff problems also unresolved, it feels like a nervy end to the year...... As usual, I'll be covering the latest news, reaction and market moves through the day.",

      "bodyText": "The top 1,500 bank staff in the UK earned an average of \u00a31m each in 2011, according to new regulatory filings by major banking employers. The information, required by the EU in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis, has been published for only the second time and sheds fresh light on the way banks regard their most senior staff \u2013 the executives who influence the risks their bank takes. The firms are not required to publish comparisons with the prior year but previously published information indicates the bankers' rewards were lower in 2011 than 2010. The new end-of-year disclosures come as banks prepare to hand out bonuses in the coming weeks for the 2012 financial year. Jon Terry, global head of financial services HR practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said bonuses at European banks could fall 50% this year. \"For the first time I can remember, we will see a clear distinction between US-headquartered banks and European banks,\" Terry said. US bank bonuses may be down by just 20%, he said. Goldman Sachs' filings, published on Friday, showed it handed an average of \u00a31.8m to its 95 code staff \u2013 those who are judged to be responsible for managing and taking risks at the firm \u2013 down from \u00a34m a head in 2010.
