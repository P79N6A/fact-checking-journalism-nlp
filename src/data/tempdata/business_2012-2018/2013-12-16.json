Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the Council to Protect Rural England, says that for people near proposed sites to accept new building they have to be convinced their schools and other services will not be overloaded.

      "bodyText": "Crisis-hit RSA Insurance suffered a further blow on Monday when rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded its credit rating just hours after rival Fitch said it was considering cutting the group's creditworthiness. In response to the one-notch downgrade to A- by S&amp;P, the insurer's chief financial officer Richard Houghton said the decision would not have a \"material impact\" on the its operations, customers or ability to trade. \"We remain confident that RSA will re-emerge as a stronger group in 2014,\" Houghton said. Fitch said it would decide on RSA's rating after the group's annual results on 27 February and more revelations of accounting problems could prompt it to downgrade.

The company has also added \u00a3200m to its Irish claims reserves to meet potential whiplash claims, depleting its potential 2013 annual profits. The announcement caused the departure of chief executive Simon Lee, leaving the group in the hands of chairman Martin Scicluna. \"Some of RSA's key financial metrics are weaker than its ratings would suggest,\" Fitch said in a note. Selling trophy assets in overseas markets, where RSA makes two thirds of its revenue, could be its least worst option. Investors who have seen their shares fall 28% since the start of this year look unlikely to back a rights issue and analysts say the company is worth less than the sum of its constituent businesses, making the prospect of a full takeover remote. \"The key thing is that if there is a capital shortfall, shareholders will be unwilling to plug it with a rights issue,\" said one institutional RSA shareholder on Monday. RSA shares have fallen by close to 12% since Thursday, the day before its latest profit warning. Scicluna, who has been running the insurer since chief executive Simon Lee quit on Friday, told Reuters any part of the business could be sold, but declined to say which were the most likely. If RSA were forced to divest trophy assets such as businesses in Scandinavia, Canada or emerging markets in Asia or Latin America, this would amount to 'selling the family silver,\" according to Shore Capital Stockbrokers. RSA would be left with a rump of slow-growth western European assets such as its Irish business, where consultant PwC is due to report on suspected accounting problems in January, and Britain, where market conditions for insurance are tough. Broker Canaccord Genuity estimated RSA would have an equity value on disposal of up to 130 pence per share, assuming the individual businesses are valued at between eight times forward earnings for the British arm, and 15 times for the Canadian unit. That compares with Canaccord's target price for the whole group of 85 pence, implying it is worth more broken up than as a whole. RSA shares were trading at around 90 pence on Monday. No bidder has yet come forward, an RSA source said on Monday. The source said the firm is being advised by its corporate brokers JP Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Scicluna and his team are scheduled for a routine meeting this week with ratings agency analysts, the source said. RSA has an implied rating of 'BBB', according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with an average of 'BB+' for its peer group of UK insurers that includes 'A' rated Aviva.",

The EBA said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Total net sovereign exposures towards European economic area countries declined by about 9% during 2011, but increased afterwards by 9.3%.

But some economists see the rate dropping to 2% while others have pencilled in a rise to 2.5%. Inflation has been above average annual earnings growth for several years now and the latest official figures put pay growth at 0.8%.</p> <p>The RPI rate in tomorrow's data from the Office for National Statistics - a measure often used for setting pay and pensions - is forecast to edge up to 2.7% from 2.6% in October.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes and Jack Allen at the thinktank Capital Economics say tomorrow's data could show CPI at the Bank of England's government-set target of 2% for the first time since November 2009. They comment: \"Admittedly, petrol prices will probably make a larger contribution to inflation than in October. While they fell by about 1% m/m last month, they dropped by nearly 2% in November 2012.</p> <p>\"Nonetheless, food inflation should ease in November. Both global agricultural commodity prices and domestic food producer prices have been falling this year. And the British Retail Consortium\u2019s timelier measure of food shop price inflation fell from 2.7% to 2.3% in November.</p> <p>\"In addition, although the two largest energy companies, British Gas and SSE, raised their prices on 15th and 23rd November respectively, these are unlikely to affect November\u2019s CPI reading. Index Day \u2013 the day of the month on which the ONS chooses to collect prices \u2013 always falls on either the second or third Tuesday of the month. The ONS does not say which day until after the release, but given the pattern of previous Index Days, we reckon the ONS recorded prices on 12th November, before the energy companies raised their prices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52af2659e4b0a4c35bcc021c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-16T16:15:45.400Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile Portugal says it has passed the latest review by the troika of lenders:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cigolo/statuses/412615275247173632\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Portugal Government Says Country Passed Bailout Review By Eu/Imf Lenders</p>&mdash; cigolo (@cigolo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cigolo/statuses/412615275247173632\">December 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cigolo/statuses/412615525030563840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Portugal Government Says Intention Is To Exit Bailout Programme As Planned In June 2014</p>&mdash; cigolo (@cigolo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cigolo/statuses/412615525030563840\">December 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cigolo/statuses/412615632601894912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Portugal Government Says Likely To Meet This Year&#39;s 5.5 Pct/Gdp Deficit Goal</p>&mdash; cigolo (@cigolo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cigolo/statuses/412615632601894912\">December 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52af23dde4b008af53c5c742\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-16T16:13:36.019Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Over in Greece, intense efforts are underway to wrap up negotiations with mission heads representing the country\u2019s troika of creditors</strong>.

Following the drop in sovereign bond yields, and the rise in share prices, financing conditions for large parts of the economy have improved, even if financing conditions for SMEs remain more challenging.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the broader economic environment has continued to weigh on the banking sector, even if that impact has recently been receding. The private sector needs to reduce its debt stocks going forward, as heavy debt burdens continue to weigh on lending to the private economy.</p> <p>Supervisors and policy makers have to continue to monitor closely the operation and stability of the banking sector. Continued in-depth diagnostics of the shock resilience and solvency of the Spanish banking sector remain vital. This is also important in order to ensure a proper preparation of the pending assessment of banks' balance sheets by the ECB and EBA in the run up to the start of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.</p> <p>The recent encouraging macroeconomic developments bear witness of advancement in the process of adjustment of the Spanish economy and corroborate the expectation of a gradual recovery in activity and of an approaching end to employment destruction.</p> <p>The economic situation remains however subject to risks as imbalances continue to be worked out. Respecting fully the agreed fiscal consolidation targets - so as to reverse the rise in government debt - and completing the reform agenda remain imperative to return the economy on a sustainable growth path.</p> <p>Following progress during 2013, the policy momentum needs to be maintained to finalise ongoing and planned reforms - amongst which are the delayed law on professional services and associations, reforms of public administration, further strengthening of labour market policies, eliminating the electricity tariff deficit and the forthcoming review of the tax system - and to ensure effective implementation of all reforms.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2013/html/pr131216_1.en.html\">Full report here.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-16T15:52:57.831Z\">at 3.52pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52af1d76e4b0a4c35bcc0212\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-16T15:38:54.341Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The protests in Ukraine have put pressure on the country's credit rating, according to Fitch.

The longer the standoff goes on, the greater the risk that political uncertainty will raise demand for foreign currency, cause inward investment to dry up, or trigger capital flight, causing additional reserve losses and increasing the risk of disorderly currency moves. <br>Developments over the weekend suggest the crisis is some way from resolution as the opposition hardens demands for a change of government. Between 150,000 and 200,000 protestors gathered in Kiev, according to press reports. <br>Even if the immediate crisis were defused and protests ended, political uncertainty would persist.

Thus, monetary policy will remain accommodative for as long as necessary.</p> <p>Adjusting interest rates is not always sufficient to maintain price stability. In this crisis, interest rate cuts have been transmitted more slowly and unevenly across euro area countries due to the fragmentation of financial markets. To address this problem, we adopted in recent years a series of non-standard measures. The purpose of these was \u2013 and remains \u2013 a more effective transmission of the ECB\u2019s interest rate cuts, so that our monetary policy can reach companies and households throughout the euro area.</p> <p>This was also the purpose of our decision in November to continue conducting all our refinancing operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at least until July 2015. Thus, we have helped to alleviate funding concerns of banks, which are still hesitant to lend to households and firms.</p> <p>Two years ago, we provided funding support to euro area banks through two Long Term Refinancing Operations with a maturity of three years each. As the funding situation of banks has improved significantly since then, banks have this year opted to repay about 40% of the initially outstanding amount. Accordingly, excess liquidity in overnight money markets has been gradually receding. We are monitoring the potential impact of these developments on our monetary policy stance. We are ready to consider all available instruments.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52af0f4ee4b008af53c5c71f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-16T14:34:21.804Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here's <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2013/html/sp131216.en.html\">the text of Draghi's speech.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52af0e45e4b008af53c5c71c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-16T14:33:25.768Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Europe, ECB president Mario Draghi is speaking at the European parliament. here are the Reuters snaps:</p> <p><strong>16-Dec-2013 14:10 - DRAGHI - UNDERLYING PRICE PRESSURES ARE SUBDUED</strong></p> <p><strong>16-Dec-2013 14:10 - DRAGHI - SEE MODEST GROWTH IN Q4 </strong></p> <p><strong>16-Dec-2013 14:11 - DRAGHI - ACCOMMODATIVE ECB MON POL STANCE WILL SUPPORT RECOVERY </strong></p> <p><strong>16-Dec-2013 14:12 - DRAGHI - GROWTH RISKS ARE ON DOWNSIDE </strong></p> <p><strong>16-Dec-2013 14:14 - DRAGHI - GOVERNING COUNCIL EXPECTS KEY ECB INTEREST RATES TO REMAIN AT PRESENT OR LOWER LEVELS FOR EXTENDED PERIOD </strong></p> <p><strong>16-Dec-2013 14:17 - DRAGHI - MONITOR MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS CLOSELY, READY TO CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE INSTRUMENTS </strong></p> <p><strong>16-Dec-2013 14:18 - DRAGHI - WE ARE FULLY AWARE OF DOWNWARD RISK THAT PROTRACTED PERIOD OF LOW INFLATION ENTAILS </strong></p> <p><strong>16-Dec-2013 14:19 - DRAGHI - SEE NO RISKS OF FINANCIAL IMBALANCES RELATED TO LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT </strong></p> <p><strong>16-Dec-2013 14:21 - DRAGHI - SOVEREIGN BONDS WILL BE TREATED RISK-FREE IN AQR, WILL BE STRESSED IN EBA STRESS TESTS </strong></p> <p><strong>16-Dec-2013 14:22 - DRAGHI -CONCERNED THAT SRM DECISION MAKING MAY BECOME OVERLY COMPLEX, FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/statuses/412589766413418498\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Useless MEPs MT <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FMR_Brussels\">@FMR_Brussels</a>: here&#39;s another great turnout for Draghi <a href=\"http://t.co/Hg9svDjwon\">pic.twitter.com/Hg9svDjwon</a></p>&mdash; Bruno Waterfield (@BrunoBrussels) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/statuses/412589766413418498\">December 16, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-16T14:34:41.032Z\">at 2.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52af0925e4b0a4c35bcc01f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-16T14:17:23.940Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the world of economics,</strong> US factory output has slowed a little this month, mirroring the news from China overnight <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/16/french-recession-fears-grow-as-private-sector-contracts-again-business-live#block-52aeaa8ee4b008af53c5c6c1\">(<strong>see 8.02am post</strong></a>).</p> <p>Markit's monthly flash measure of American manufacturers came in at 54.4, down from 54.47 in November.

      "bodyText": "European banks - especially in Italy and Spain - have been increasingly buying up their own sovereign debt using cheap ECB funds since 2011, reports Reuters. The news comes from a report from the European Banking Authority which shows that EU banks continued to improve their capital positions, as disclosed by new data for 64 banks across 21 countries. The data puts all the banks' key measures on the same template for easier transparency, and shows the core tier 1 capital leve increased by more than \u20ac80bn between December 2011 and June 2013. The EBA said: Total net sovereign exposures towards European economic area countries declined by about 9% during 2011, but increased afterwards by 9.3%. Half of the sovereign exposures are held in the available for sale portfolios. The share of bonds issued by sovereigns under stress held by domestic banks has increased markedly between December 2010 and June 2013. Commenting on the results, Andrea Enria, Chairperson of the EBA, said: \u201cThis data confirms the progress made on the recapitalisation of EU banks\u201d and added: \u201cThe EBA continues its efforts to enhance transparency in EU banking. Developing common definitions and regular disclosure are fundamental to support effective market discipline\u201d. And here is Reuters' take on the story: European banks have filled their balance sheets with national debt since 2011, bringing them easy profits but reinforcing a \"doom loop\" linking weak banks to governments with shaky finances. The eurozone debt crisis showed banks can suffer big losses from holdings of their own countries' bonds, which in turn can torpedo state finances if banks need to be bailed out. Policymakers have been trying to loosen the mutual exposure of banks and governments that ensured they dragged one another down during the crisis. The data confirms what many already suspected - that banks, particularly in Italy and Spain, have been ploughing cheap funds from the European Central Bank into buying more of their own countries' bonds, a lucrative carry trade that has also helped ensure governments can fund their deficits at sustainable rates. The full story is here: 'Doom loop' tying European banks and governments reinforced And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. European markets have started an important week on a positive note. After days of decline as investors fretted about the US Federal Reserve turning off the money taps at this week's meeting, it appears the concensus seems to be shifting again to the idea no action will be taken until the new year. Helped by a spate of merger activity in the US, Wall Street opened sharply higher and gave a boost to markets elsewhere. So here are the closing scores: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 82.24 points or 1.28% higher at 6522.20 \u2022 Germany's Dax ended up 1.74% at 916i3.56 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.48% better at 4119.88 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 2.34% to 18,222.42 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 1.69% to 9429.5 \u2022 But the Athens market spoiled the trend, down 0.85% at 1146.88 Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 129 points or 0.8% higher. Coming up in the UK tomorrow morning, the latest inflation data are expected to show price rises steadied last month but still outstripped wage growth. My colleague Katie Allen writes: The consumer price index measure of inflation is expected to hold at 2.2% in November according to the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll. But some economists see the rate dropping to 2% while others have pencilled in a rise to 2.5%. Inflation has been above average annual earnings growth for several years now and the latest official figures put pay growth at 0.8%. The RPI rate in tomorrow's data from the Office for National Statistics - a measure often used for setting pay and pensions - is forecast to edge up to 2.7% from 2.6% in October. Jonathan Loynes and Jack Allen at the thinktank Capital Economics say tomorrow's data could show CPI at the Bank of England's government-set target of 2% for the first time since November 2009. They comment: \"Admittedly, petrol prices will probably make a larger contribution to inflation than in October. While they fell by about 1% m/m last month, they dropped by nearly 2% in November 2012. \"Nonetheless, food inflation should ease in November. Both global agricultural commodity prices and domestic food producer prices have been falling this year. And the British Retail Consortium\u2019s timelier measure of food shop price inflation fell from 2.7% to 2.3% in November. \"In addition, although the two largest energy companies, British Gas and SSE, raised their prices on 15th and 23rd November respectively, these are unlikely to affect November\u2019s CPI reading. Index Day \u2013 the day of the month on which the ONS chooses to collect prices \u2013 always falls on either the second or third Tuesday of the month. The ONS does not say which day until after the release, but given the pattern of previous Index Days, we reckon the ONS recorded prices on 12th November, before the energy companies raised their prices. Meanwhile Portugal says it has passed the latest review by the troika of lenders: Over in Greece, intense efforts are underway to wrap up negotiations with mission heads representing the country\u2019s troika of creditors. Our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith reports. With debt-stricken Greece\u2019s next tranche of international aid resting on the talks, finance minister Yannis Stournaras said it was the government\u2019s aim to conclude negotiations before tomorrow\u2019s crucial euro group meeting. But the omens do not look good. In unusually terse statements made before the onset of a fourth round of talks focusing on the thorny issue of bank repossession of homes, the development minister Kostis Hadzidakis insisted that Athens\u2019 fragile coalition government would simply not adopt measures \u201cat any price.\u201d \u201cIt is our intention to reach an agreement \u2026 but it is obvious that we are not going to agree at any price. The government cannot go back [on its promises] and accept whatever it is offered,\u201d he said adding that under the terms offered by creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF, vulnerable Greeks would lose their homes. \u201cIt is easy to agree but afterwards you have to handle the social consequences,\u201d he told Skai radio. The talks, which began at 4:30 PM local time, are being billed as \u201cthe very last\u201d effort to find consensus on the potentially explosive issue. After Ireland's exit from the bailout this weekend, ECB boss Mario Draghi seems to be trying to pour cold water on the optimism. From his appearance at the European Parliament: Back with Draghi: Following the fifth and final review of Spain's financial sector, the troika of the ECB, European Commission and IMF have welcomed signs of stabilisation at the country's banks while warning more needs to be done: Spain has pulled back from severe problems in some parts of its banking sector, thanks to its reform and policy actions, with the support of the euro area and broader European initiatives. Spanish financial markets have further stabilised. Following the drop in sovereign bond yields, and the rise in share prices, financing conditions for large parts of the economy have improved, even if financing conditions for SMEs remain more challenging. Nevertheless, the broader economic environment has continued to weigh on the banking sector, even if that impact has recently been receding. The private sector needs to reduce its debt stocks going forward, as heavy debt burdens continue to weigh on lending to the private economy. Supervisors and policy makers have to continue to monitor closely the operation and stability of the banking sector. Continued in-depth diagnostics of the shock resilience and solvency of the Spanish banking sector remain vital. This is also important in order to ensure a proper preparation of the pending assessment of banks' balance sheets by the ECB and EBA in the run up to the start of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. The recent encouraging macroeconomic developments bear witness of advancement in the process of adjustment of the Spanish economy and corroborate the expectation of a gradual recovery in activity and of an approaching end to employment destruction. The economic situation remains however subject to risks as imbalances continue to be worked out. Respecting fully the agreed fiscal consolidation targets - so as to reverse the rise in government debt - and completing the reform agenda remain imperative to return the economy on a sustainable growth path. Following progress during 2013, the policy momentum needs to be maintained to finalise ongoing and planned reforms - amongst which are the delayed law on professional services and associations, reforms of public administration, further strengthening of labour market policies, eliminating the electricity tariff deficit and the forthcoming review of the tax system - and to ensure effective implementation of all reforms. Full report here. The protests in Ukraine have put pressure on the country's credit rating, according to Fitch. The agency said: The duration and scale of anti-government protests in Ukraine has put additional pressure on the country's credit profile. The longer the standoff goes on, the greater the risk that political uncertainty will raise demand for foreign currency, cause inward investment to dry up, or trigger capital flight, causing additional reserve losses and increasing the risk of disorderly currency moves. Developments over the weekend suggest the crisis is some way from resolution as the opposition hardens demands for a change of government. Between 150,000 and 200,000 protestors gathered in Kiev, according to press reports. Even if the immediate crisis were defused and protests ended, political uncertainty would persist. The government would still be likely to find it hard to resolve the diplomatic challenge of building closer relations with the EU while placating Russia. Full report here: Ukraine Protests Increase Pressure on Credit Profile And here's ECB president Draghi on any trimming by the US Federal Reserve of its $85bn a month bond buying programme: After days in the doldrums, markets are moving sharply higher. Investors have been selling shares in recent dayks amid concerns the US Federal Reserve could start turning off the money taps as early as this week's meeting. Strong US economic data - including industrial output today - has made that more likely, as has the signs of political agreement about the US budget. But on the whole, observers still think, in the main, the Fed will wait until next year. So with a spate of acquisitions, including Avago Technologies paying $6.6bn for LSI Corporation, shares are back in favour for the moment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently nearly 1% or 156 points higher, helping to pull the FTSE 100 to its highest levels of the day, up more than 1.3%. Back to the news that Lloyds of London has appointed its first female boss, and my colleague Jill Treanor has the full story: Forty years after the first woman entered the Lloyd's of London dealing floor as a broker, the 325-year-old insurance market has named its first female boss. The company is to be run by 30-year industry veteran Inga Beale from January. Currently the chief executive of Canopius, a Lloyd's managing agent thought to be the subject of a takeover bid, Beale will replace Richard Ward who surprised the industry by resigning in the summer. More here: Lloyd's of London appoints first female chief executive in 325-year history Draghi is strking a dovish tone, according to Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy: The ECB's Draghi comments in front of the EU Parliament strike a rather dovish tone on the current state of the EMU economy. Indicators signal that the EMYU recovery is set to grow at a modest pace in Q4 and the ECB is ready to act if needed. The effects of past policy easing will be clear only with a certain delay. In the meanwhile, the ECB is fully aware of downside risks on inflation. And it seems more MEPs have now turned up to hear Draghi: Draghi warned: We should not create a Single Resolution Mechanism that is single in name only. In this respect, I am concerned that decision-making may become overly complex and financing arrangements may not be adequate. I trust that the European Parliament, together with the Council, will succeed in creating a true Banking Union. Draghi also discussed the Single Supervisory Mechanism, and there would be stress tests for sovereign bonds as part of the process: An important element of our preparations is the comprehensive assessment, which comprises a supervisory risk assessment, an asset quality review and a stress test performed in cooperation with the European Banking Authority (EBA). ...The process for the selection of asset portfolios to be reviewed for the asset quality review was initiated in November, based on specific data collections. Furthermore, we expect to announce the key parameters of the stress test exercise together with the EBA towards the beginning of next year. In this context, let me explain again the treatment of sovereign bonds: The Asset Quality Review is a valuation exercise where we will apply the current regulatory framework. It is not for us to change this framework \u2013 this is a global discussion, and the Basel Committee is the right forum for it. That said, we will of course \u201cstress\u201d a wide range of assets as part of the stress tests: Sovereign bonds will be among them. On interest rates and other measures, Draghi said: Our forward guidance still remains in place: we continue to expect ECB key interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. Thus, monetary policy will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. Adjusting interest rates is not always sufficient to maintain price stability. In this crisis, interest rate cuts have been transmitted more slowly and unevenly across euro area countries due to the fragmentation of financial markets. To address this problem, we adopted in recent years a series of non-standard measures. The purpose of these was \u2013 and remains \u2013 a more effective transmission of the ECB\u2019s interest rate cuts, so that our monetary policy can reach companies and households throughout the euro area. This was also the purpose of our decision in November to continue conducting all our refinancing operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at least until July 2015. Thus, we have helped to alleviate funding concerns of banks, which are still hesitant to lend to households and firms. Two years ago, we provided funding support to euro area banks through two Long Term Refinancing Operations with a maturity of three years each. As the funding situation of banks has improved significantly since then, banks have this year opted to repay about 40% of the initially outstanding amount. Accordingly, excess liquidity in overnight money markets has been gradually receding. We are monitoring the potential impact of these developments on our monetary policy stance. We are ready to consider all available instruments. And here's the text of Draghi's speech. Over in Europe, ECB president Mario Draghi is speaking at the European parliament. here are the Reuters snaps: 16-Dec-2013 14:10 - DRAGHI - UNDERLYING PRICE PRESSURES ARE SUBDUED 16-Dec-2013 14:10 - DRAGHI - SEE MODEST GROWTH IN Q4 16-Dec-2013 14:11 - DRAGHI - ACCOMMODATIVE ECB MON POL STANCE WILL SUPPORT RECOVERY 16-Dec-2013 14:12 - DRAGHI - GROWTH RISKS ARE ON DOWNSIDE 16-Dec-2013 14:14 - DRAGHI - GOVERNING COUNCIL EXPECTS KEY ECB INTEREST RATES TO REMAIN AT PRESENT OR LOWER LEVELS FOR EXTENDED PERIOD 16-Dec-2013 14:17 - DRAGHI - MONITOR MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS CLOSELY, READY TO CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE INSTRUMENTS 16-Dec-2013 14:18 - DRAGHI - WE ARE FULLY AWARE OF DOWNWARD RISK THAT PROTRACTED PERIOD OF LOW INFLATION ENTAILS 16-Dec-2013 14:19 - DRAGHI - SEE NO RISKS OF FINANCIAL IMBALANCES RELATED TO LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT 16-Dec-2013 14:21 - DRAGHI - SOVEREIGN BONDS WILL BE TREATED RISK-FREE IN AQR, WILL BE STRESSED IN EBA STRESS TESTS 16-Dec-2013 14:22 - DRAGHI -CONCERNED THAT SRM DECISION MAKING MAY BECOME OVERLY COMPLEX, FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE Back in the world of economics, US factory output has slowed a little this month, mirroring the news from China overnight (see 8.02am post). Markit's monthly flash measure of American manufacturers came in at 54.4, down from 54.47 in November. That indicates that US firms (manufacturers and service firms) still grew, but at a slightly slower rate. The employment measures showed that firms hired new staff at the fastest rate in nine months, and Markit reckons that this quarter is turning into the best three months for US factories this year. And separate data from the Federal Reserve backs this point up -- it just reported a 1.1% jump in industrial output in November. On that note, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Inga Beale's appointment as boss of Lloyd's of London will go a small way to closing the gender gap at the top of the City. But there's still some way to go. Currently there are just three women running FTSE 100 companies -- Angela Ahrendts at Burberry; Carolyn McCall at EasyJet, and Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco. Moya Greene will become the fourth when Royal Mail enters the index on Wednesday night. Lloyd's of London isn't a listed company, so Beale won't join the quartet. The total will rise to five when BT executive Liv Garfield moves to run Severn Trent -- but, with Ahrendts joining Apple next year, the total could soon drop back to four. Concern has been growing recently that the City is still a tilted playing field. A survey last week found that a man who starts his career with a FTSE 100 company is four and a half times more likely to reach the executive committee than his female counterpart (the Financial Times has more details). The UK has a target of 25% female representation across corporate boards by 2015 -- currently the figure is 19%, up from 12.5% in 2010. So there appears to be progress.... except that women who do reach senior positions are in jobs that are traditionally lower paid. How times change.... Inga Beale is appointed as Lloyd's first woman CEO just 40 years after the London insurance market welcomed its first ever female broker into the ranks. Liliana Archibald was a pioneer in 1973 when she became the first ever Lloyds broker, after Lloyd's decided to move with the times. She now gets a space in the Historic Heroes section of Lloyd's website, which explains: At that time, Lloyd\u2019s made a decision to accept women as Names. Archibald applied and in 1973 was accepted. She told Lloyd\u2019s List, \u2018I did not break down the barriers; they were broken down for me by the members of Lloyd\u2019s in a very charming way.\u2019 Lloyd's of London has appointed its first ever female chief executive. Inga Beale will succeed Richard Ward in January. She currently runs Canopius Group, the Lloyd's-based insurance and reinsurance group. There had been many whispers in the City in recent days that Beale was in line for the top job at Lloyds, making her the first women to lead the insurance market in its 325-year history. Beale has worked in insurance for three decades -- beginning her career in insurance as an underwriter with Prudential. She's also previously worked as Global Chief Underwriting Officer of Zurich Insurance, and as Group CEO of Converium Ltd. John Nelson, Chairman of Lloyd's, said: I am absolutely delighted that we have appointed Inga as Chief Executive. She has 30 years\u2019 experience in the insurance industry. Her CEO experience, underwriting background, international experience and operational skills, together with her knowledge of the Lloyd's market, make Inga the ideal Chief Executive for Lloyd's. I very much look forward to working with her. In the statement just published, Beale said Lloyd's has \"an extraordinary opportunity to increase its footprint and to cement its position as the global hub for specialist insurance and reinsurance\". Back in June, she argued that more diverse boardrooms could deliver stronger results. Beale explained: I think the business is run differently if you have women around the decision making table and that\u2019s why it\u2019s good to have diversity, not just on the gender side. Different people approach things differently and provide alternative views \u2013 diverse boards help companies make better decisions, which affect the bottom line. It's been a good few days for gender equality in the corporate world, with Mary Barra being appointed to lead General Motors last week. The Eurozone's trade surplus almost doubled year-on-year in October -- but a fall in imports, rather than a surge of exports, is the main factor. Eurostat reports that the eurozone's posted a trade surplus of \u20ac17.2bn with the rest of the world in October, up from \u20ac9.6bn in October 2012.. The trade surplus was also much larger on a month-on-month basis, up from \u20ac10.9bn in September. That sounds encouraging, but a peek at the data confirms that the flow of goods into the eurozone has stumbled since the eurozone crisis began. Seasonally adjusted imports fell by 1.2% in October compared with September, while exports rose by 0.2%. So far this year, exports are up 1% to \u20ac1.578trn, while imports are down 3% at \u20ac1.455trn. The resulting trade surplus, of almost \u20ac123bn, is double last year's \u20ac57.4bn. The data also underlined today's theme -- the divergence between Germany and France. So far this year, the largest surplus has been recorded in Germany (+\u20ac148.3bn in January-September 2013), followed by the Netherlands (+\u20ac40.5bn), Ireland (+\u20ac28.5bn), Italy (+19.6bn), Belgium (\u20ac11.6bn) and the Czech Republic (+\u20ac10.6bn). The biggest deficit was registered in France (-\u20ac57.5bn) , followed by the United Kingdom (-\u20ac55.1bn), Greece (-\u20ac14.5bn) and Spain (-\u20ac11.6bn). Troubled insurance firm RSA is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning, shedding almost 3%. Trader fear RSA's recent problems -- three profits warning, and the resignation of its CEO -- could hit its credit rating. RSA Insurance drops another 3% on credit rating fears In the City, power firm Aggreko is leading the FTSE 100 risers after announcing decent results -- and a deal to supply temporary power for the World Cup and Commonwealth Games in 2014. That's sent its shares up 6% (clawing back losses suffered last week). Aggreko wins World Cup and Commonwealth Games power contracts The euro has risen this morning, up 0.2% to $1.3765 against the US dollar. That reflects Markit's view that today's PMI data doesn't make fresh stimulus from the European Central Bank more likely. There's also edginess ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Wednesday -when it might start to ease back on its $85bn/month bond-buying programme Peter O'Flanagan of Clear Currency reckons the Fed won't taper this week: Although there are continued signs of improvement in the US economy we feel the Fed may well look for one more month of strong data before they announce the scaling back of their QE program. That being said we think this decision will be down to the wire. It's a positive start to the week in Europe's stock markets. The Spanish and Italian markets are the best performers, following the news that private firms in the periphery are enjoying their best month since April 2011, according to Markit FTSE 100: up 32 points at 6,472, + 0.5% German DAX: up 45 points at 9,052, +0.5% French CAC: up 16 points at 4,076, + 0.4% Spanish IBEX: up 141 points at 9,414, + 1.5% Italian FTSE MIB: up 253 points at 18,089, +1.4% Howard Archer of IHS sums up the good news in today's data..... Some relatively decent news for Eurozone recovery prospects with the December purchasing managers surveys indicating that overall Eurozone manufacturing and services output expanded for a sixth month running and at the fastest rate since September. Furthermore new orders picked up in December to the highest level since mid-2011, thereby lifting hopes that Eurozone activity can pick up at the start of 2014. ... and the bad: However, there was pretty dire news on France where overall manufacturing and services activity contracted for a second month running in December and at the fastest rate for seven months following on from GDP contraction of 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. This suggests that there is a very real danger that France is slipping back into shallow recession and reinforces concern about France\u2019s underlying competitiveness. Activity across the Eurozone private sector has risen this month as the single currency area ends the year with 'fragile' growth, according to Markit's new data published this morning. It found that output in peripheral eurozone countries picked up in December. With Germany already reporting solid growth this morning (see here), France looks increasingly like the 'sick man of Europe' as its firms struggle. Markit's Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index -- which measures activity at thousands of firms across the eurozone -- rose to 52.1 in December, up from 51.7 in November. That's a 'flash' estimate, of course, but it suggests stronger growth in most parts of the euro area - not just Germany. December is turning into a good month for eurozone manufacturers, with output rising for the sixth successive month. The rate of increase was the highest since April 2011 . Service sector growth was more modest, though, with the rate of expansion hitting a four-month low (but there was still growth) But as this graph shows, France was the laggard - with its service and manufacturing firms reporting a drop in activity (see 8.23am for details). Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the data suggested the eurozone will grow modestly this quarter, by 0.2%. He fears that France could fall back into recession though, as the gap between the eurozone's two biggest countries gets bigger . Williamson explained: The rise in the PMI after two successive monthly falls is a big relief and puts the recovery back on track. The upturn means that, over the final quarter, businesses saw the strongest growth since the first half of 2011, and have now enjoyed two consecutive quarters of growth.\u201d On the downside, the PMI is signalling a mere 0.2% expansion of GDP in the fourth quarter, suggesting the recovery remains both weak and fragile. The upturn is also uneven. Growth is concentrated in manufacturing, where rising exports have helped push growth of the sector to the fastest for two-and- a-half years, while weak domestic demand led to a further slowing in service sector growth. However, it\u201fs the unbalanced nature of the upturn among member states that is the most worrying. France looks increasingly like the new \"sick man of Europe\u201f, as a second successive monthly contraction may translate into another quarterly decline in GDP, pushing the country back into a technical recession. In contrast, the December survey data round off a solid quarter of growth in Germany, in which GDP looks set to rise by 0.5%. There\u201fs little here to suggest that euro area policymakers need to increase their stimulus, but on the other hand the sluggish nature of the upturn adds to the sense that policy will remain ultra- accommodative for quite some time. And here's some reaction to the news that growth in Germany manufacturing sector is currently running at a 30-month high.... Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit: Manufacturing achieved a particularly strong end to the year, with improving new order flows and renewed job creation also providing encouragement that the sector has gained momentum since the autumn. Growth of new work was the fastest for over two-and- a-half years while stocks of finished goods were depleted at an accelerated pace. Quite a contrast with France, where firms reported that orders are falling (see 8.23am) Germany's private sector is leaving France in the dust, Markit reports, led by its manufacturers. Private sector output in the eurozone's largest economy is growing steadily this month, for the eighth month in a row. German factories saw output growth accelerate, pushing the manufacturing PMI up to a 30-month high of 54.2, up from 52.7 in November. Service sector firms expanded at a slower pace than in November, but growth was still solid. The Service sector PMI was 54.0, down from 55.7. This meant the composite German private sector PMI fell slightly to 55.2 in December, down slightly on November's 55.4 -- but still indicating healthy expansion. That suggests Germany's economy will grow this quarter. Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet points out that other French economic surveys have been less pessimistic than the PMI readings... And this graph shows how recent PMI data has been more negative than the official growth data: Here's how experts are reacting to the news of France's weakening private sector: Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said the drop in French private sector activity suggests that France's GDP will shrink by about 0.1% in the current quarter. That would follow the 0.1% contraction in July-September -- putting France back into recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth) Williamson added: The pipeline of work that companies have to deal with is drying up and we'll get to a stage where, if that doesn't turn around, there will be increased job losses. France could be sliding into a double-dip recession, as its private sector activity continues to fall this month. Data provider Markit reports that the rate of decline in French private sector output accelerated during December. It recorded the biggest contraction in output in seven months. That suggesting that France's economy is still shrinking, as manufacturers and service sector struggle to win new contracts. The Markit Flash France Composite Output Index, slipped to 47.0, from 48.0 in November -- that's the second month in a row that it's been below 50 points (which signals a drop in activity). In a report shy of good news, Markit found that new orders are decreasing in the French private sector, meaning companies are relying on existing work to keep busy. Backlogs of work fell solidly and at the sharpest pace in eight months, it said. Staffing levels also continued to decline during December, as firms shed staff. Andrew Harker, Senior Economist at Markit, said the readings \"paint a worrying picture on the health of the French economy. The return to contraction in November has been followed up with a sharper reduction in December, with falling new business at the heart of this as clients were reportedly reluctant to commit to new contracts. Firms will hope that such reticence ends in the new year as they seek to avoid another protracted downturn. Details to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone, and the business world. The last full working week of 2013 (in these parts, anyway) begins with the news that growth in China's factory sector has slowed this month, for the third month in a row. It's that stage in the month when data provider Markit produces its 'flash' estimates of activity in key economies, based on interviews with purchasing managers (We get data from France and Germany this morning too). And China's PMI has fallen to 50.5 for December, from November's 50.8, with firms reporting that output growth slowed. That's closer to the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. It may suggest the global economy is ending the year on a weaker note. As well as slowing output growth, firms also reported a drop in employment. On a happier note, new orders have picked up. The news sent China's stock market sliding to a four-week low, with the Shanghai Composite Index shedding 1.6%. That's set the tone for an edgy start to the week, as global investors await the US Federal Reserve's monthly meeting on Wednesday night (where the Fed might take the plunge and slow the pace of its stimulus programme). Also on the agenda-- the implications of Germany's new government, after the CDU and the SPD formally formed a coalition over the weekend. And I'll be keeping an eye on Greece, where the government and the Troika are continuing to hold talks over its bailout programme.....",

      "bodyText": "Aggreko has won contracts to supply power at next year's World Cup in Brazil and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, following a challenging period for the British company. Shares in the temporary power supplier rose 5.8%, making it the biggest FTSE 100 riser on Monday morning, as it revealed the major sporting event wins and updated the market on the full year. Revenue will be roughly flat at \u00a31.57bn, while pre-tax profit is expected to be \"at least\" \u00a3335m in the year to 31 December, lower than the \u00a3367m achieved in 2012 but slightly above analysts' expectations of \u00a3332m. Aggreko will provide temporary power for broadcasting of all World Cup matches in each of the 12 host cities, as well as for the International Broadcast Centre in Rio de Janeiro. It will supply and operate more than 46 megawatts of generating capacity, 1,000 distribution panels and 200km of electric cables. The major contract wins are a welcome boost for the company, which faced a weakened outlook at the end of last year when the end of its 2012 Olympics contract coincided with declining military work and doubts over contract extensions in Japan, prompting two profit warnings in two months. John Lawson, an analyst at Investec, said Aggreko's latest statement should be seen as a \"welcome update\", with no nasty shocks. \"Investors should be able to sleep slightly easier tonight, with no profit warning and no bad debt write-down.\" On a regional basis, the company said underlying full-year revenue \u2013 excluding the boost from the London Olympics a year earlier \u2013 was likely to be around 8% higher in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa business. Underlying revenue is expected to grow by around 7% in the Americas and fall by around 12% in Asia Pacific, largely as a result of contracts finishing in Japan. Net debt is expected to fall by around \u00a3200m to below \u00a3400m as it scaled back investment in 2013 to deal with the weaker outlook. Other deals secured recently include a six-month 80-megawatts diesel contract in Panama, under which Aggreko will provide power as a licensed generator to the country's wholesale electricity market.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's housebuilders have launched a scathing counter attack against Ed Miliband's claim that they are hoarding land for profit. The industry said plots are built on as soon as planning permission is secured, and argued that the 557% increase in profits among the nation's four biggest housebuilders this year comes from a very low base following the financial crisis. Pete Redfern, chief executive of Taylor Wimpey, said: \"The industry is only just returning to the point where it is meeting its cost of capital following the most prolonged downturn in housing history. \"The comparison used for profitability is against a point where many in the industry were loss making, so a percentage improvement is rather meaningless.\" Britain's chronic housing shortage is expected to push up prices by as much as 8% next year according to the property website Rightmove, unless a flood of new properties are built. The biggest four developers by turnover \u2013 Barratt, Berkeley, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey \u2013 have a collective land holding of almost 300,000 plots. Miliband is accusing housebuilders of holding on to land to push up values, and claims some \"stick-in-the-mud councils\" are blocking development. Redfern strongly rejected the Labour leader's accusation that housebuilders are hoarding land. \"We continue to start all sites as soon as possible once an implementable planning permission is received. Taylor Wimpey specifically and the industry as a whole have only a tiny percentage of sites that have a planning permission, where construction has not been started.\" A spokesman for the Home Builders' Federation (HBF), the industry's trade body, said: \"Developers don't land bank, all the evidence is there. As soon as developers get a planning permission they want to start on site. Developers are not land hoarders.\" One major housebuilder said companies in the sector would be perceived as hugely risky and lose investment if they did not have sufficiently long land bank holdings of typically more than four years. The HBF said the industry would work with Michael Lyons, the chair of Labour's new independent commission on housing, to improve understanding of the issues. \"We are looking to work with the Lyons Commission to help them understand the complexity of housing delivery going forward.\" Lyons said the country needed to build more than 200,000 homes a year by 2020 if demand was to be met and the backlog of under-supply addressed. Shares in the sector were down on Monday morning, with Persimmon shares 1.7% lower, Barratt down 0.9% and Taylor Wimpey off 0.2%.",

But in 2014 it warned that margins in its events business would fall to 30%, below forecasts, and also pointed to adverse exchange rate effects given that 85% of its revenues are generated in currencies other than the strengthening pound.</p> <p>UBM's shares are currently down 25.5p at 649.5p. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said:</p> <blockquote> UBM produced a pre-close trading update with a reassuring message for 2013, but pointing to downward pressure on 2014 forecasts. <br> Management is flagging a reduction in events margins, due to both biennial effects (obviously, this had been expected) but also space constraints at some of its larger shows. As such, events margins are now expected to be \"about 30%\" in 2014, which will be down from close to 32% in 2013. There is also likely to be an foreign exchange impact, with a \u00a32.7m profit hit from every 1 cent move in the dollar/pound, against a 2013 average of 1.56 - so at current rates, there would be a \u00a318m or so hit to profits from foreign exchange translation on a year on year basis.  It has been a disappointing year for UBM, with downgrades both from the data services division disposal, but also the core events business. The impact of foreign exchange is clearly outside management control, but events margin guidance points to weaker trends elsewhere. We are leaving our 2013 forecasts unchanged, but we downgrade our 2014 pretax profit estimate from \u00a3166m to \u00a3160.3m. </blockquote> <p>Canaccord kept its hold rating, as did Numis. But the latter cut its target price from 732p to 710p, saying:</p> <blockquote> Further to UBM's pre-close this morning we make further adjustments to our forecasts for 2014, resulting in a more substantial downgrade than initially anticipated. A combination of moving parts including lower expected biennial contribution in 2014 (a number of shows moved to annual), a higher expected interest, tax and minority charge, combine to see our adjusted earnings per share in 2014 fall to 49p from 54p. <br> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Capita</strong> is down 3.5p at 990.5p, on concerns of further sales by fund manager Invesco following the departure of Neil Woodford. Invesco has reportedly been cashing in some of Woodford's stakes, which include not only Capita but Drax and Provident Financial.</p> <p>Meanwhile a report that Capita's contract with Birmingham council could be cancelled has also hit sentiment. David Brockton at Liberum said:</p> <blockquote> The contract is worth around \u00a3120m revenue per annum. equating to around 2.7% of annual revenues. If this were to occur it would be a blow for Capita, although a more likely outcome would be a downward revision in contract scope. </blockquote>",

As such, events margins are now expected to be \"about 30%\" in 2014, which will be down from close to 32% in 2013. There is also likely to be an foreign exchange impact, with a \u00a32.7m profit hit from every 1 cent move in the dollar/pound, against a 2013 average of 1.56 - so at current rates, there would be a \u00a318m or so hit to profits from foreign exchange translation on a year on year basis. It has been a disappointing year for UBM, with downgrades both from the data services division disposal, but also the core events business. The impact of foreign exchange is clearly outside management control, but events margin guidance points to weaker trends elsewhere. We are leaving our 2013 forecasts unchanged, but we downgrade our 2014 pretax profit estimate from \u00a3166m to \u00a3160.3m. Canaccord kept its hold rating, as did Numis. But the latter cut its target price from 732p to 710p, saying: Further to UBM's pre-close this morning we make further adjustments to our forecasts for 2014, resulting in a more substantial downgrade than initially anticipated. A combination of moving parts including lower expected biennial contribution in 2014 (a number of shows moved to annual), a higher expected interest, tax and minority charge, combine to see our adjusted earnings per share in 2014 fall to 49p from 54p. Elsewhere Capita is down 3.5p at 990.5p, on concerns of further sales by fund manager Invesco following the departure of Neil Woodford. Invesco has reportedly been cashing in some of Woodford's stakes, which include not only Capita but Drax and Provident Financial. Meanwhile a report that Capita's contract with Birmingham council could be cancelled has also hit sentiment. David Brockton at Liberum said: The contract is worth around \u00a3120m revenue per annum. equating to around 2.7% of annual revenues. If this were to occur it would be a blow for Capita, although a more likely outcome would be a downward revision in contract scope.",

The state Labor opposition sees political capital in this low-key response, labelling Napthine \u201clazy, inept and out of touch\u201d. Steve Dargavel, Victoria state secretary of the AMWU, dismisses suggestions that the car industry has been on over-subsidised life support for years. \u201cThere are significant opportunities for blue collar jobs here in Victoria, but it will need a significant response from the government, rather than a training package that means workers go to TAFE and become a barista,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t accept Australia has invested heavily in the automotive industry, when you compare it to the fuel rebate the mining industry gets. On international benchmarks, we are one of the most miserly contributors.\u201d Dargavel is careful to point out that he doesn\u2019t believe the car industry is doomed in Australia, but it\u2019s telling that he\u2019s already looking to other sectors for his members\u2019 future. \u201cAustralia will be spending $100bn over the next 10 years on defence procurement, most of it going offshore,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could create significant opportunities here. If we build ships here, there\u2019s 20 years of work for these guys. The government may get it cheaper offshore, but the negatives outweigh the positives for the communities here.\u201d Even if other opportunities are found, there remains the lingering sense that any remedy is likely to be short lived. These blue collar workers wave their union flags as they bellow insults at Abbott, but it\u2019s hard to escape the fact this could be one fight too many. \u201cIt\u2019s been gut wrenching but I see no other outcome but the auto industry shutting down in Australia, which will have a big impact on the manufacturing industry,\u201d says Darren Kirwan, who has spent 13 years at Holden as an electrician, from his apprenticeship until now. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a sombre mood at the moment. It\u2019ll be worse for the older guys as they\u2019ll have a problem getting back into the workforce. But even for the younger blokes, manufacturing will be non-existent in this country for them. There will be a lot of young people thinking \u2018What\u2019s the point of getting a trade?\u2019 \u201d Would you become an electrician now, if you were leaving school? \u201cI\u2019d be having second thoughts about it, certainly,\u201d he says. \u201cIf people don\u2019t build things, there\u2019s not much call for electricians. What\u2019s the point?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain's high streets have suffered their biggest drop in shopper numbers for more than a year, according to a report that indicates a slow start to the festive retail season. The British Retail Consortium's latest numbers also showed a drop in footfall for out-of-town shops and for shopping centres, echoing sales data that has pointed to a tentative mood among Christmas shoppers. The BRC's figures, supplied by Springboard, revealed a 3.4% annual drop in footfall for high streets from September to November, the sharpest fall since August 2012. For November alone, footfall was down 2.9% on a year ago across all shop types. This matched October's drop and was largely caused by a 4.2% fall in high-street shoppers. All regions reported a decline in footfall, and the steepest drop was in the West Midlands. Helen Dickinson, BRC's director general, said the November fall \"tallies with recent signs in our sales data that festive spending has got off to a slow but steady start\". She added: \"While some areas saw an improvement in footfall compared with the previous month, numbers were negative across the board, strengthening the sense that many of us were holding off on major shopping trips until December ushered in the final countdown to Christmas.\" A separate report released on Monday underlines the pressures being felt by households as wages fail to keep pace with inflation. The latest Household Finance Index from data company Markit showed people felt their financial wellbeing had deteriorated but that they were more upbeat about the future. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: \"December's survey suggests that a rising proportion of UK households are hopeful that the squeeze on their finances will begin to subside during 2014. \"However, while job insecurities have receded this year, the latest survey highlights that income and saving trends remain very subdued, especially at the lower end of the pay spectrum.\" Businesses are also feeling more upbeat about the year ahead as the recovery gathers steam, according to a report from the the Federation of Small Businesses. It says firms remain positive about the economic outlook, want to expand and are finding it a little easier to access finance. John Allan, national chairman at the FSB, said: \"Confidence has been in positive territory for a full year, giving economic growth solid foundations moving into 2014. Small firms are creating more jobs and investing in their business.\"",

All regions reported a decline in footfall, and the steepest drop was in the West Midlands.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, BRC's director general, said the November fall \"tallies with recent signs in our sales data that festive spending has got off to a slow but steady start\".</p> <p>She added: \"While some areas saw an improvement in footfall compared with the previous month, numbers were negative across the board, strengthening the sense that many of us were holding off on major shopping trips until December ushered in the final countdown to Christmas.\"</p> <p>A separate report released on Monday underlines the pressures being felt by households as wages fail to keep pace with inflation.</p> <p>The latest Household Finance Index from data company Markit showed people felt their financial wellbeing had deteriorated but that they were more upbeat about the future.</p> <p>Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: \"December's survey suggests that a rising proportion of UK households are hopeful that the squeeze on their finances will begin to subside during 2014.</p> <p>\"However, while job insecurities have receded this year, the latest survey highlights that income and saving trends remain very subdued, especially at the lower end of the pay spectrum.\"</p> <p>Businesses are also feeling more upbeat about the year ahead as the recovery gathers steam, according to a report from the the Federation of Small Businesses.</p> <p>It says firms remain positive about the economic outlook, want to expand and are finding it a little easier to access finance.</p> <p>John Allan, national chairman at the FSB, said: \"Confidence has been in positive territory for a full year, giving economic growth solid foundations moving into 2014. Small firms are creating more jobs and investing in their business.\"</p>",
