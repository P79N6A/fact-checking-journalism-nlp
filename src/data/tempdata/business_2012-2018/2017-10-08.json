      "bodyText": "Rents in Britain dropped in the final summer months for the first time in at least five years, according to Rightmove. National asking rents outside London fell by 0.2% in the three months to September, which is one of the busiest times of year for tenants looking for a new home. It was the first fall at this time of year since Rightmove started tracking rents in late 2011. The decline comes as landlords flood the south-east of England with newly available rental properties, distorting the national picture, as they turn away from a stuttering London property market. The glut of homes available to rent pushed down rents in the south-east by 2.3% in the period. Average rents rose in every other UK region apart from Greater London and Yorkshire and the Humber. The biggest quarterly increase came in the north-east, where the average asking rent rose by 2.6% to \u00a3564 per month. Britain\u2019s housing market is looking increasingly broken amid a chronic shortage of new homes. Young people are particularly hard hit, with millennials spending three times more of their income on housing than their grandparents, often for worse quality accommodation, according to the Resolution Foundation. The proportion of households privately renting in the UK has ballooned in the past 20 years. According to official figures, around 65% of UK households were owner-occupiers at the end of 2016, while 17% were renting from a private landlord and 18% from a social landlord. Theresa May pledged an additional \u00a32bn a year to councils and housing associations for affordable homes in her speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester last week. Rightmove\u2019s head of lettings, Sam Mitchell, said more landlords were acquiring homes immediately outside London, therefore increasing the supply of available property and pushing down rents. \u201cAgents are reporting that some investors looking for better yields are shifting their focus from London,\u201d he said. Areas such as Surrey, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire are among the most popular for landlords seeking investments outside of London. Prices have not fallen as much in areas with good commuter links, where demand remains strong. Asking rents in the capital fell at an annual rate of 3.3% in September to an average of \u00a31,920 per month. The average asking rent per month across the country in September was \u00a3789. However, Mitchell said he expected the cost of renting to increase in London due to the supply of available accommodation decreasing as landlords look elsewhere for investments.",

      "bodyText": "Socialism is back, much to the chagrin of those who declared it dead and buried at the \u201cend of history\u201d in the 1990s. When the New Republic, long the house organ of American neoliberalism, runs an article on The Socialism America Needs Now, it\u2019s clear that something has fundamentally changed. The soft neoliberalism represented by Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and Paul Keating has exhausted its appeal, and not just in the English-speaking world. Throughout Europe, new movements of the left have emerged to challenge or displace social democratic parties discredited by the austerity politics of the last decade. Support for socialism is particularly strong among those under 30, whose economic experience has been dominated by the global financial crisis (GFC) and the subsequent decade of economic stagnation and rising inequality. The most striking example is the recent UK election where Jeremy Corbyn received over 60% of the votes of those aged 18-25. Similarly in the US, Bernie Sanders drew his most enthusiastic support from the young. For most of the current political class whose ideas were formed in the last decades of the 20th century, the superiority of markets over governments is an assumption so deeply ingrained that it is not even recognised as an assumption. Rather, it is part of the \u201ccommon sense\u201d that \u201ceveryone knows\u201d. Whatever the problem, their answer is the same: lower taxes, privatisation and market-oriented \u201creform\u201d. Unsurprisingly, people are looking for an alternative, and many are looking back at the postwar decades of widely shared prosperity. Some have turned to the tribalist politics of nostalgia (Make America Great Again, We Want Our Country Back), exemplified in Australia by Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation party. But it is already evident that this is a dead end. The disastrous mess being made by Donald Trump\u2019s Republicans and Theresa May\u2019s Tories is the inevitable result of a politics based on what academic Lionel Trilling described, in the foreword to his essay collection The Liberal Imagination (1950), as \u201cirritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas\u201d. The dominant advocates of free markets have long derided any kind of government intervention as \u201csocialism\u201d. This has been taken to a ludicrous extent recently, the studiously moderate Bill Shorten being described by senior government ministers as a \u201cred socialist\u201d who will turn Australia into the next Cuba. But what do today\u2019s resurgent socialists mean by socialism? It\u2019s easier to see what they dislike than to describe a socialist policy agenda. Most obviously, socialism implies an unqualified rejection of the system of financial capitalism (variously called neoliberalism, market liberalism or, in Australia, economic rationalism) that emerged from the economic chaos of the 70s. Neoliberalism has massively enriched the 1%, and particularly the financial sector, while delivering nothing but economic insecurity and stagnant living standards to the great majority of the population. This is obvious in the United States, but the same patterns are emerging in market economies throughout the world. More significantly, contemporary socialism repudiates the vaguely humanised capitalism marketed as the third way. It\u2019s a break with those social democrats and liberals who embraced, or capitulated to, the politics of austerity in the wake of the GFC, such as the New Labour of Blair and Brown, PASOK in Greece and the Dutch Labour party, and, most importantly of all, the Clinton Democrats in the United States. On the other hand, there\u2019s no detectable enthusiasm for a centrally planned economy like that of the former Soviet Union or Mao\u2019s China. Communism is a distant and discredited memory, even for those old enough to recall the days when it seemed like a possible alternative. As it is used today, the term socialism does not reflect a well-worked ideology. Rather it conveys an attitude that could be described as \u201cunapologetic social democracy\u201d or, in the US context, \u201cliberalism with a spine\u201d. It\u2019s expressed in support for proposals that break with the cautious incrementalism of the past, and are in some cases frankly utopian: universal basic income, free post-school education, large increases in minimum wages, and so on. That\u2019s important, but a real alternative needs more than attitude and a grab-bag of policy ideas. After decades in which the focus has been on critiquing neoliberalism, the task of thinking about positive alternatives is urgent, but efforts in this direction are only just beginning. Discussion of economic policy in socialist terms is confined to a handful of small publications, such as Jacobin, a US magazine edited by Bhaskar Sunkara, with notable contributors including Seth Ackerman, Peter Frase and Noam Chomsky. Equally significant has been the resurgence of the left in mainstream economics, represented by Paul Krugman, Thomas Piketty and Joseph Stiglitz. While not explicitly socialist (Krugman\u2019s blog is called The Conscience of a Liberal) these economists have focused attention on issues of inequality and unemployment, and on progressive policy responses. These are, however, only first steps. To develop a serious socialist alternative, we need both to look backwards to the social democratic moment of the 50s and 60s, and forwards to the prospects for a genuine sharing economy based on the internet and other technological advances. The middle of the 20th century was a unique period of sustained economic growth and broadly shared prosperity in developed market economies. The crucial feature underpinning this success was full employment, guaranteed by Keynesian macroeconomic management. In an economy with full employment, workers are no longer dependent on the goodwill of individual employers or the confidence of business as a whole. If one job does not suit, there is always another. In these circumstances, the distribution of market income between wages and profits, and among wage-earners, tends naturally towards greater equality. Conversely, as we\u2019ve seen since the 70s, when governments are driven by the need to please financial markets, ever-growing inequality is the inevitable result. The most striking evidence is the rising share of income going to the top 1%, as documented by Piketty and others. The success of Keynesian stimulus in the immediate aftermath of the GFC and the disastrous outcomes from the shift to austerity after 2010 show that Keynesian economic management is as vital as ever. Going beyond crisis management, socialist governments would reinstate the commitment to full employment, and solidify it through policies such as a jobs guarantee, ensuring the availability of a full-time job for anyone who has been unemployed for some minimum period. However, the technological and social changes that have taken place over the past 60 years mean that the traditional notion of full employment, focused on full-time jobs for male breadwinners, is no longer adequate. We need a more flexible approach, accommodating the more diverse patterns of life and work of the 21st century. In this context, the idea of a universal basic income set at a level comparable to the age pension has considerable appeal. The ultimate goal would be to provide an unconditional payment lower than the return from working but sufficient to sustain decent living standards. An interim step, proposed by the late Tony Atkinson in his final book, Inequality: What Can Be Done?, would be a participation income available to people who undertook voluntary work to benefit the community. The combination of a job guarantee and a universal basic income would free workers from dependence on employers. But this would only be feasible if society could ensure adequate production of crucial goods and services, without dependence on the wishes of big business. The first step in this regard is to revive a term that was widely used and is still relevant to describe the economy of the mid-20th century: the mixed economy. This phrase refers to an economy with major roles for both public and market provision of goods and services. Typically, the public sector provided infrastructure such as electricity, water and road networks, and human services such as health and education. Most of our existing assets in these fields were built up under public ownership. The market sector provided consumer goods, and the wholesale and retail trade networks needed to distribute them, along with a wide range of services. The push for privatisation, beginning with the Thatcher government in the 80s, was based on the premise that private ownership and market competition would outperform public-sector provision. The process of privatisation and marketisation was far from complete by the time of the GFC, and large areas of public provision continued. The privatisation movement has produced some successes. Although it was built up under public ownership, Qantas has prospered as a private firm. There\u2019s no obvious need for a national flag carrier in a competitive airline market. These successes have been more than outweighed by disastrous failures. Recent, but by no means exceptional, Australian examples include the disaster of for-profit vocational education and the comprehensive failure of the national electricity market. The most common outcome of privatisation has been somewhere in between the handful of successes and spectacular failures such as those mentioned. In essence, public monopolies have been replaced by regulated private monopolies and oligopolies. Investors and top managers have done well out of this process, while workers and consumers have lost. The public has long since lost faith in the promise of privatisation and is in fact supportive of re-nationalisation. Yet, as with the labour market, we can\u2019t simply revive the mid-20th century economy. First, technological change has radically changed the structure of the economy and society. The central role in the industrial economy of the mid-20th century was played by manufacturing, which took the resources produced by mining and agriculture and transformed them into goods to be distributed through transport, wholesale and retail trade systems to consumers. By contrast, the 21st century economy is dominated by services including health, education and telecommunications, which require different forms of economic organisation. Second, the mid-20th century was a period when economic activity (work for governments or businesses, undertaken for pay or profit in factories, shops and offices) was sharply distinguished from non-economic activity (housework, voluntary activity and non-government organisations). These sharp distinctions are no longer tenable. Thanks to mobile phones and the internet, much paid work is done at home. More importantly, the economic value of the internet as a whole depends entirely on its content, much of which (Facebook and blog posts, Twitter, personal and group websites and so on) is produced by users rather than for economic return. To reimagine a 21st century socialist economy we need to consider a much broader mix of forms of economic activity than those of the 20th century mixed economy. These include: big business small business government businesses public non-market provision not-for profits and NGOs household production Under financial capitalism, the standard way of providing goods and services is through big business: large corporations, with an associated network of subsidiaries and dependent contractors. Big business has grown at the expense of the public sector through privatisation and at the expense of independent small businesses through increased market concentration. At the same time, labour market reforms have reduced the bargaining power of workers and increased that of employers. The combined effects have included increasingly concentrated wealth and power, wage stagnation and slow economic growth. Even the OECD has recognised this. A socialist program would allocate much less economic activity to big business, and more to other forms of organisation. In deciding what kind of economic activity belongs where, a range of considerations are relevant. These include the scale of the activity, the extent to which it is possible and appropriate to charge market prices, the scope for competition and the relative importance of economic and non-economic motives. In part this would imply reversing the neoliberal program of privatisation and marketisation. Large-scale capital intensive activities with limited scope for competition, such as the provision of infrastructure, would be returned to public ownership. We are already seeing the beginnings of this process, with a notable example in the South Australian government\u2019s investment in electricity generation. The Turnbull government denounced South Australia\u2019s policies as those of a \u201csocialist paradise\u201d, sure to lead to economic disaster. In very short order, however, Turnbull was announcing his own interventions, with the expansion of Snowy Hydro and restrictions on gas exports. We have even seen the suggestion that the commonwealthmight buy the Liddell power station (recently privatised by its state counterparts) to extend its operating life. This is a nonsensical idea, but it illustrates the extent to which the taboo on government intervention has lost its power. Similarly, we are seeing some attempts to reconstruct the public Tafe system after the fiasco of for-profit vocational training and the Fee-Help system. The Victorian government in particular has taken some positive steps. A socialist program in the 21st century needs to involve much more than a reversal of neoliberalism. The internet and the information economy have broken the link between productive activity and market returns. Information is a pure public good, which can be shared again and again with no additional costs. So the production of information (ranging from scientific research to Instagram pictures) has potentially huge social value. On the other hand, the market value of internet activity depends, almost entirely, on the ease with which it can be packaged up with commercial advertising \u2013 meaning access is artificially constrained. The fact that information is naturally a public good creates a huge potential for economic and social benefits of which we have realised only a small fraction. The combination of strong intellectual property laws and reliance on advertising to finance internet content mean that our access to information is artificially constrained. Governments could address this problem, providing vastly increased access to resources of all kinds, from artistic and cultural content to designs to be used in 3-D printers. But the policies of neoliberal austerity have pushed us in the opposite direction, cutting budgets and pushing public institutions of all kinds towards more reliance on user pricing and advertising. There is also much more room for voluntary and non-government activity. The neoliberal state, through contracting, competitive tendering and the audit culture, has sought to turn voluntary work and non-government organisations into low-cost providers of government services. In the process, much of the creative potential of civil society has been lost. Expanding the scope for voluntary social initiatives would fit naturally with a socialist program, and this is already beginning with the rise of social enterprises. The idea of a socialist economy with unconditional access to basic incomes and greatly expanded provision of free services might seem utopian. But in the aftermath of neoliberal failure, utopian vision is what is needed. To re-engage people with democratic politics, we need to move beyond culture wars and arguments over marginal adjustments to tax rates and budget allocations, necessary as these may be in the short term. Socialists have always seen short-term political struggles as part of a long-term project of transforming society for the better. It is this fact which explains why conservatives have always used the term \u201csocialist\u201d as a bogeyman. It\u2019s also why the term has retained its appeal through decades of neoliberal retrenchment. Social democratic and liberal parties, compromised by their acquiescence in, or embrace of, neoliberalism, need to make a decisive break with the recent past. An explicit embrace of socialism would make that break clear.",

Rather it conveys an attitude that could be described as \u201cunapologetic social democracy\u201d or, in the US context, \u201cliberalism with a spine\u201d. It\u2019s expressed in support for proposals that break with the cautious incrementalism of the past, and are in some cases frankly utopian: universal basic income, free post-school education, large increases in minimum wages, and so on. </p> <p>That\u2019s important, but a real alternative needs more than attitude and a grab-bag of policy ideas. After decades in which the focus has been on critiquing neoliberalism, the task of thinking about positive alternatives is urgent, but efforts in this direction are only just beginning. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a65bf36f4f7b56be1922735c62bc8a4eb569756c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a65bf36f4f7b56be1922735c62bc8a4eb569756c/0_0_4174_2783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn is welcomed by an enthusiastic crowd at the 2017 Glastonbury Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn is welcomed by an enthusiastic crowd at the 2017 Glastonbury festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Discussion of economic policy in socialist terms is confined to a handful of small publications, such as Jacobin, a US magazine edited by Bhaskar Sunkara, with notable contributors including <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/author/seth-ackerman/\">Seth Ackerman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/author/peter-frase\">Peter Frase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/author/noam-chomsky/\">Noam Chomsky</a>. </p> <p>Equally significant has been the resurgence of the left in mainstream economics, represented by Paul Krugman, Thomas Piketty and Joseph Stiglitz. While not explicitly socialist (Krugman\u2019s blog is called <a href=\"http://www.krugmanonline.com/\">The Conscience of a Liberal</a>) these economists have focused attention on issues of inequality and unemployment, and on progressive policy responses.</p> <p>These are, however, only first steps. To develop a serious socialist alternative, we need both to look backwards to the social democratic moment of the 50s and 60s, and forwards to the prospects for a genuine sharing economy based on the internet and other technological advances.</p> <p>The middle of the 20th century was a unique period of sustained economic growth and broadly shared prosperity in developed market economies. The crucial feature underpinning this success was full employment, guaranteed by Keynesian macroeconomic management. In an economy with full employment, workers are no longer dependent on the goodwill of individual employers or the confidence of business as a whole. If one job does not suit, there is always another. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/27/its-not-new-to-accuse-labor-of-socialism-but-this-panicked-attack-is-threadbare\">It's not new to accuse Labor of socialism but this panicked attack is threadbare | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In these circumstances, the distribution of market income between wages and profits, and among wage-earners, tends naturally towards greater equality. Conversely, as we\u2019ve seen since the 70s, when governments are driven by the need to please financial markets, ever-growing inequality is the inevitable result. <em></em>The most striking evidence is the rising share of income going to the top 1%, as documented by Piketty and others.</p> <p>The success of Keynesian stimulus in the immediate aftermath of the GFC and the disastrous outcomes from the shift to austerity after 2010 show that Keynesian economic management is as vital as ever. Going beyond crisis management, socialist governments would reinstate the commitment to full employment, and solidify it through policies such as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/03/stop-exploiting-people-cut-unemployment-job-guarantee-underwritten\">jobs guarantee</a>, ensuring the availability of a full-time job for anyone who has been unemployed for some minimum period. <em><strong><br></strong></em></p> <p>However, the technological and social changes that have taken place over the past 60 years mean that the traditional notion of full employment, focused on full-time jobs for male breadwinners, is no longer adequate. We need a more flexible approach, accommodating the more diverse patterns of life and work of the 21st century.</p> <p>In this context, the idea of a universal basic income set at a level comparable to the age pension has considerable appeal. The ultimate goal would be to provide an unconditional payment lower than the return from working but sufficient to sustain decent living standards. An interim step, proposed by the late Tony Atkinson in his final book, Inequality: What Can Be Done?, would be a <a href=\"http://www.involve.org.uk/2015/06/12/what-about-a-participation-income/\">participation income</a> available to people who undertook voluntary work to benefit the community. <em></em></p> <p>The combination of a job guarantee and a universal basic income would free workers from dependence on employers. But this would only be feasible if society could ensure adequate production of crucial goods and services, without dependence on the wishes of big business.</p> <p>The first step in this regard is to revive a term that was widely used and is still relevant to describe the economy of the mid-20th century: the mixed economy. This phrase refers to an economy with major roles for both public and market provision of goods and services. Typically, the public sector provided infrastructure such as electricity, water and road networks, and human services such as health and education. Most of our existing assets in these fields were built up under public ownership. The market sector provided consumer goods, and the wholesale and retail trade networks needed to distribute them, along with a wide range of services.</p> <p>The push for privatisation, beginning with the Thatcher government in the 80s, was based on the premise that private ownership and market competition would outperform public-sector provision. The process of privatisation and marketisation was far from complete by the time of the GFC, and large areas of public provision continued. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/am-i-socialist-google-autocomplete\">Am I a socialist?

In essence, public monopolies have been replaced by regulated private monopolies and oligopolies. Investors and top managers have done well out of this process, while workers and consumers have lost.</p> <p>The public has long since lost faith in the promise of privatisation and is in fact supportive of <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/05/19/nationalisation-vs-privatisation-public-view/\">re-nationalisation</a>. Yet, as with the labour market, we can\u2019t simply revive the mid-20th century economy.</p> <p>First, technological change has radically changed the structure of the economy and society. The central role in the industrial economy of the mid-20th century was played by manufacturing, which took the resources produced by mining and agriculture and transformed them into goods to be distributed through transport, wholesale and retail trade systems to consumers. </p> <p>By contrast, the 21st century economy is dominated by services including health, education and telecommunications, which require different forms of economic organisation.</p> <p>Second, the mid-20th century was a period when economic activity (work for governments or businesses, undertaken for pay or profit in factories, shops and offices) was sharply distinguished from non-economic activity (housework, voluntary activity and non-government organisations). </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the aftermath of neoliberal failure, some utopian vision is what is needed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These sharp distinctions are no longer tenable. Thanks to mobile phones and the internet, much paid work is done at home. More importantly, the economic value of the internet as a whole depends entirely on its content, much of which (Facebook and blog posts, Twitter, personal and group websites and so on) is produced by users rather than for economic return.</p> <p>To reimagine a 21st century socialist economy we need to consider a much broader mix of forms of economic activity than those of the 20th century mixed economy. These include:<br></p> <ul> <li>big business <br></li> <li>small business<br></li> <li>government businesses<br></li> <li>public non-market provision<br></li> <li>not-for profits and NGOs <br></li> <li>household production<br></li> </ul> <p>Under financial capitalism, the standard way of providing goods and services is through big business: large corporations, with an associated network of subsidiaries and dependent contractors. Big business has grown at the expense of the public sector through privatisation and at the expense of independent small businesses through increased market concentration. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cc1bdb3bc66e8e8cbe28681bfa1cbc28b7467293\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc1bdb3bc66e8e8cbe28681bfa1cbc28b7467293/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders attend a campaign rally in Los Angeles, California in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders attend a campaign rally in Los Angeles, California in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, labour market reforms have reduced the bargaining power of workers and increased that of employers. The combined effects have included increasingly concentrated wealth and power, wage stagnation and slow economic growth. <a href=\"http://insidestory.org.au/the-oecd-joins-the-backlash-against-unfettered-globalisation/\">Even the OECD</a> has recognised this. </p> <p>A socialist program would allocate much less economic activity to big business, and more to other forms of organisation. In deciding what kind of economic activity belongs where, a range of considerations are relevant. These include the scale of the activity, the extent to which it is possible and appropriate to charge market prices, the scope for competition and the relative importance of economic and non-economic motives.</p> <p>In part this would imply reversing the neoliberal program of privatisation and marketisation. Large-scale capital intensive activities with limited scope for competition, such as the provision of infrastructure, would be returned to public ownership. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/something-big-has-to-change-could-australia-afford-a-universal-basic-income\">'Something big has to change': could Australia afford a universal basic income?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are already seeing the beginnings of this process, with a notable example in the South Australian government\u2019s investment in electricity generation. The Turnbull government <a href=\"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/malcolm-turnbull-calls-south-australia-a-socialist-paradise-says-home-generators-are-needed-to-keep-lights-on/news-story/52d485369bd964464ddd200e56634e7c\">denounced South Australia\u2019s policies</a> as those of a \u201csocialist paradise\u201d, sure to lead to economic disaster. </p> <p>In very short order, however, Turnbull was announcing his own interventions, with the expansion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/28/malcolm-turnbull-pledges-more-funds-for-snowy-hydro-20-as-labor-attacks-gas-crisis\">Snowy Hydro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/28/government-cant-guarantee-gas-prices-will-fall-with-export-restrictions\">restrictions on gas exports</a>. We have even seen the suggestion that the commonwealth<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/turnbull-puts-all-options-on-the-table-to-keep-agls-liddell-coalfired-power-station-going-20170906-gyc19q.html\">might buy the Liddell power station</a> (recently privatised by its state counterparts) to extend its operating life. This is a nonsensical idea, but it illustrates the extent to which the taboo on government intervention has lost its power.</p> <p>Similarly, we are seeing some attempts to reconstruct the public Tafe system<em><strong> </strong></em>after the fiasco of for-profit vocational training and the Fee-Help system. <a href=\"http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/students-finally-return-to-lilydale-tafe-site/\">The Victorian government in particular </a>has taken some positive steps. </p> <p>A socialist program in the 21st century needs to involve much more than a reversal of neoliberalism. The internet and the information economy have broken the link between productive activity and market returns. Information is a pure public good, which can be shared again and again with no additional costs. </p> <p>So the production of information (ranging from scientific research to Instagram pictures) has potentially huge social value. On the other hand, the market value of internet activity depends, almost entirely, on the ease with which it can be packaged up with commercial advertising \u2013 meaning access is artificially constrained.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/03/stop-exploiting-people-cut-unemployment-job-guarantee-underwritten\">What if we could stop exploiting people and cut unemployment at a stroke? | Phil McDuff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that information is naturally a public good creates a huge potential for economic and social benefits of which we have realised only a small fraction. The combination of strong intellectual property laws and reliance on advertising to finance internet content mean that our access to information is artificially constrained. Governments could address this problem, providing vastly increased access to resources of all kinds, from artistic and cultural content to designs to be used in 3-D printers. </p> <p>But the policies of neoliberal austerity have pushed us in the opposite direction, cutting budgets and pushing public institutions of all kinds towards more reliance on user pricing and advertising.</p> <p>There is also much more room for voluntary and non-government activity. The neoliberal state, through contracting, competitive tendering and the audit culture, has sought to turn voluntary work and non-government organisations into low-cost providers of government services. In the process, much of the creative potential of civil society has been lost. Expanding the scope for voluntary social initiatives would fit naturally with a socialist program, and this is already beginning with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/apr/29/social-enterprise-job-creation\">rise of social enterprises.</a> <em></em></p> <p>The idea of a socialist economy with unconditional access to basic incomes and greatly expanded provision of free services might seem utopian. But in the aftermath of neoliberal failure, utopian vision is what is needed. To re-engage people with democratic politics, we need to move beyond culture wars and arguments over marginal adjustments to tax rates and budget allocations, necessary as these may be in the short term. </p> <p>Socialists have always seen short-term political struggles as part of a long-term project of transforming society for the better. It is this fact which explains why conservatives have always used the term \u201csocialist\u201d as a bogeyman. It\u2019s also why the term has retained its appeal through decades of neoliberal retrenchment. Social democratic and liberal parties, compromised by their acquiescence in, or embrace of, neoliberalism, need to make a decisive break with the recent past. An explicit embrace of socialism would make that break clear.<br></p>",

In a skirmish that illustrates the tensions caused by the gig economy, the Deliveroo kitchen \u201cpods\u201d are coming under fire as councils accuse the meal delivery company of bypassing planning rules and residents complain of excessive noise. Named the \u201cRoobox\u201d, the kitchens are either housed in temporary metal buildings the size of a shipping container or temporarily set up in an industrial building. They have appeared in the London districts of Camberwell, Dulwich, Canary Wharf, Battersea, as well as Hove near Brighton as a way to help meet demand for takeaways in areas where popular brands do not have restaurants. Each pod has room for six or seven chefs from different restaurants who work alongside each other making food solely for takeaway. Rooboxes, also known as Deliveroo Editions, are seen as a key avenue of growth by by the company, which is now setting up London locations in Whitechapel, Islington, Crouch End, Swiss Cottage, Bermondsey and Wimbledon as well as Reading, Leeds and Birmingham. MEATLiquor, Ahi Poke, Tommi\u2019s Burger Joint and Mother Clucker are all reported to be opening kitchens in at least one of the new sites. Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Busaba Eathai, Crust Bros and Motu Indian Kitchen, set up by the family behind Mayfair\u2019s upmarket Gymkhana restaurant, already operate from at least one Roobox. By the end of 2017, Deliveroo said it would have more than 200 Editions kitchens in 30 sites across the UK, and more internationally. But Deliveroo\u2019s Roobox in Camberwell, south London, may be forced to close after Southwark council said the buzz of delivery vans and mopeds was a nuisance to neighbours and had been set up without planning permission. Cllr Mark Williams, cabinet member for regeneration and new homes, said: \u201cThe council is concerned by Deliveroo\u2019s use of the Valmar Road trading estate as their kitchen pods are close to people\u2019s homes, are clearly disturbing the residents and they didn\u2019t apply for the necessary planning permission. \u201cWe have served a planning enforcement notice that requires Deliveroo to stop preparing and delivering food from the site. We encourage them to work with us and listen to local residents so that we can find a long-term solution.\u201d Southwark is also investigating the setup of three Deliveroo pods in a car park in east Dulwich. In Hove, Deliveroo is operating out of an existing commercial building where it was permitted to change the use to a kitchen. But Brighton &amp; Hove council said it was investigating the site as part of a retrospective planning application for vents and other additions. Residents are reported to have complained about the noise of delivery vehicles to and from the kitchens. Haringey council said it had not received a planning application from Deliveroo\u2019s in relation to a site in Hornsey, north London. A spokesperson said: \u201cOur planning team has made contact with Deliveroo and made clear that it will have to submit a planning application for any new use on the site.\u201d Deliveroo has leased the unused industrial space from charity Action for Kids for five years. Graham Duncan, the chief executive of the charity, said Deliveroo had been granted permission to use the spare land behind its head office as a way of earning money to refurbish other buildings for activities for children. He said the project was likely to help create jobs in the area. He said Deliveroo\u2019s lease on land squeezed between an electric power hub and industrial estate was dependent on the company gaining proper planning permission and the charity had \u201cthought carefully if the site was likely to create a nuisance\u201d. \u201cWe are not just after the cash, we have to balance that with the needs of our neighbours,\u201d he said. \u201cOther users were likely to have caused more traffic and inconvenience for us and our neighbours.\u201d A spokesperson for Deliveroo said: \u201cWe have been talking with local residents to put in place measures to deal with any concerns. Where there are issues with planning permission, we will work closely with relevant local authorities to ensure they are resolved.\u201d Deliveroo has sought and won temporary permission for seven of its Roobox outlets in the car park of Blackwall DLR station near Canary Wharf in the London borough of Tower Hamlets. The company\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cEach Editions kitchen is a hi-tech, custom-built kitchen that is designed in collaboration with our restaurant partners.

      "bodyText": "Foreign firms have put the brakes on buying British rivals this year in response to Brexit uncertainty, despite the lure of snapping up businesses that have tumbled in value after a slump in the pound. A study of UK buyouts and merger deals involving foreign firms showed that the value of purchases of British-owned businesses fell in the first nine months of the year to its lowest level since 2010. The internal study by the consultancy EY, seen by the Guardian, found that the value of deals so far this year was roughly two-thirds of the average reported over the last seven years. British firms are awash with cash after three years of bumper profits. The combination of strong balance sheets and the low pound was expected to make them the target of foreigns takeovers or mergers that involve selling a large portion of their business to foreign buyers. But EY said the lack of interest in buying UK firms \u201csuggests a possible fall in confidence\u201d as the UK\u2019s economic prospects have become clouded in uncertainty. Mark Gregory, EY\u2019s chief UK economist, said the UK was missing out on a global trend for an increasing number of mergers and buyouts, with firms in the eurozone experiencing a surge of cross-border activity in the last year. He said: \u201cThe fall in the value of foreign mergers and acquisitions of UK companies suggests a possible fall in confidence about the UK\u2019s economic prospects. \u201cThere was a surge in foreign activity to $100bn in the two quarters after the referendum on EU membership, probably driven by the change in value of sterling, but this fell dramatically in the first quarter of 2017 to $6bn and total activity in 2017 to date is only just over $50bn.\u201d Each year, hundreds of foreign firms buy stakes in UK businesses or purchase a company outright to boost their presence in Britain or benefit from specialist technology and expertise. The mobile phone chipmaker Arm Holdings was bought last year by Japan\u2019s SoftBank for \u00a324.3bn in a move that was seen by government ministers as a vote of confidence in the UK economy after the referendum. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, welcomed figures in the summer that showed the UK attracted more than 2,200 new inward investment projects in 2016-17, a record number. But the statistics published by the Department for International Trade (DIT) revealed new jobs created by foreign investment fell by 9% last year and the number of foreign-controlled companies reporting that they expanded revenues also fell. The department said 75,226 jobs were created in 2016/17, down from 82,650 in 2015/16. The number of firms that reported growing fell from 821 to 782. EY said large deals such as the Arm Holdings buyout made the figures volatile, but a slump in activity was visible this year. Gregory said British businesses had responded to the uncertainty created by the Brexit talks by buying foreign companies, though this had tailed off in recent months. He said the aim was to make themselves less reliant on the UK should it begin to suffer a slowdown when talks between London and Brussels conclude in 2019. UK businesses were also buying domestic rivals, pushing figures for domestic takeovers to $59bn, the highest value since 2010. \u201cThe increased value of domestic activity appears to paint a different picture to the slowing international activity, but it is actually consistent with the implied fall in confidence suggested by the international activity,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cWhat we are observing is increased defensive activity in the domestic market with businesses using M&amp;A to generate revenue or operating synergies through buying scale and reducing competition.\u201d He said many of the deals were large companies hoovering up smaller rivals\u2019 new skills and technology as an alternative to R&amp;D. The UK\u2019s GDP growth slowed this year to rank as the lowest in the G7. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) expects the UK growth rate to slip further next year, keeping it at the bottom of the growth league. EY said its study, which covers deals worth more than $100m and excludes property deals, was a \u201ca good guide to corporate sentiment\u201d and Britain\u2019s relative attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment. \u201cThe UK M&amp;A market recovered slowly after the financial crisis but announced deal values recovered to post-crash highs in 2014 and 2015. The market slowed in 2016 and this trend has continued in 2017 with deal values and volumes well below those of 2015,\u201d it added.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s housing market is dysfunctional. The rate of home ownership is plummeting, and the average age at which people become owner-occupiers is rising. In London and other property hotspots, the rents are unaffordable for those working at the sharp end of the service sector. Homelessness is on the up. William Beveridge identified housing as a postwar challenge for Britain back in 1942 when he named squalor as one of the \u201cgiant evils\u201d that barred the way to progress. Three-quarters of a century later, the giant still is alive and well. One curious thing about the housing market is that it is not really a market at all, at least not in the classic sense. As every student learns on their first day of economics, markets work through the law of supply and demand. Low prices act as a disincentive to produce but as prices rise so supply increases. Conversely, demand falls as prices rise because buyers consider products too expensive. There is a point where there is neither too little nor too much supply, but just the right amount to satisfy demand. The world of real estate, however, is a million miles away from the textbooks. Economic theory suggests that homeowners would be encouraged to put their homes on the market when prices are rising, and that potential buyers would lose interest until prices start to fall. This is not what tends to happen. Homeowners hold on to their homes because they assume that their property will continue to go up in price. Nor do rising prices dampen demand. Rather, people think they had better scramble on to the ladder before it is too late. Policy decisions also matter. Britain is a small country with strict planning laws, which makes it harder for the supply of new homes to respond to rising demand than it would, for example, in the United States. The tax treatment of domestic property is generous, meanwhile, with no capital gains tax on prime residences and a ludicrously outdated council tax system. The mismatch between supply and demand has been made worse still in recent years by the government\u2019s help to buy scheme, whereby people can top up a 5% deposit on a new-build home with a 40% state loan in London and 20% elsewhere in the country. The scheme has led to still higher prices without doing much to boost supply, but that didn\u2019t stop Philip Hammond from announcing last week that he was putting another \u00a310bn into it. This dwarfed the \u00a32bn the prime minister announced for the building of new affordable homes. Help to buy exists because the combination of rising prices and stagnant wages has made life tougher for buyers. In 2002, the median house price in England was 5.11 times average earnings, according to the Office for National Statistics. The ratio had risen to 7.14 by the time the financial crisis put an end to the noughties property boom, after which it slipped back to 6.39 during the recession. It then started rising again and hit 7.72 last year. The trend has been even more marked in London, where the house price to earnings ratio rose from 6.9 to 12.88 between 2002 and 2016. Those on the lowest incomes in London have fared worst of all. In 2016, someone among the bottom 25% of earners looking to buy a property in the cheapest 25% band would expected to pay 13.52 times their annual earnings. In 2002, the figure was 7.11. These figures give rise to two questions. How has it been possible for house price increases to outpace wage rises to such an extent? And how are people managing to keep up the payments on the mortgages required for such expensive homes? The answer to both questions is the same. The monetary stimulus provided by the Bank of England \u2013 ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 has put a rocket under prices, but slashed the cost of servicing a mortgage. Although the price of the average home in London has increased from \u00a3174,000 to \u00a3435,000 in the past 15 years, the fact that official interest rates have been 0.5% or lower for getting on for nine years has meant that the share of income spent on the mortgage has not risen. It has been a different story for those in the private rented sector, who pay almost twice the housing costs of those buying a home. It is estimated that a quarter of households who rent privately in London spend more than half of their income on rent. Anyone who imagines that this state of affairs can continue indefinitely is kidding themselves. There comes a point when prices become so hot that buyers find their monthly payments too much of a stretch even with interest rates at rock bottom levels. The fizzling out of house price inflation during the course of 2017 suggests that moment has arrived. There comes a point too when pressure starts to build for interest rates to rise. That moment is also upon us, with the Bank of England gearing up to tighten policy next month. In reality, the Bank\u2019s freedom of movement is limited and it is inconceivable that interest rates will return to their pre-recession level of 5%, or anything like it, but the very high ratio of house prices to earnings means that even a modest increase in borrowing costs will reduce discretionary household spending at a time when it is already being squeezed. All that stands between Britain and a rip-roaring housing crash is Threadneedle Street\u2019s willingness to spare borrowers from chunky increases in mortgage rates. The alternative to yet another boom-bust is to try to construct a saner housing market. There are five steps to this. The first is to stop doing more harm through counter-productive policies such as help to buy. The second is to change the tax system, starting with council tax reform and action to prevent land hoarding. The third is to increase supply, and the housing expert Kate Barker has suggested ways the government could do so, such as identifying large sites abutting urban areas and acquiring them at a modest premium to the value of their existing use. Step four is for the Bank of England to adopt a kid-glove approach to raising interest rates. The idea is to engineer a gradual fall in real \u2013 inflation-adjusted \u2013 house prices, not a recession that leads to a sharp increase in unemployment. Step five is to find a way of boosting wages, because there are two ways in which houses can become more affordable. Earnings can rise or house prices can fall. The housing market will only become less dysfunctional when Britain becomes more productive.",

The third is to increase supply, and the housing expert Kate Barker has suggested ways the government could do so, such as identifying large sites abutting urban areas and acquiring them at a modest premium to the value of their existing use.</p> <p>Step four is for the Bank of England to adopt a kid-glove approach to raising interest rates. The idea is to engineer a gradual fall in real \u2013 inflation-adjusted \u2013 house prices, not a recession that leads to a sharp increase in unemployment.</p> <p>Step five is to find a way of boosting wages, because there are two ways in which houses can become more affordable. Earnings can rise or house prices can fall. The housing market will only become less dysfunctional when Britain becomes more productive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Christine Lagarde, boss of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to deliver a hard-hitting speech at the organisation\u2019s annual meeting this week, urging world leaders to push ahead with reforms to turn the current global economic recovery into something more sustainable. Lagarde, who is now in her second four-year term as managing director of the Washington-based lender of last resort, will talk about a lack of education, training and productivity. She will, no doubt, develop the argument she put forward in London a fortnight ago that regulators need to be wary of lenders outside the mainstream repeating the same errors as the banks a decade ago. The need to tame a rapidly growing shadow banking industry will be set alongside concerns about government finances and how those administrations that are awash with cash, like Germany and South Korea, \u201ccan use this moment to invest more in their own economies\u201d, to help others with large deficits, as she said last week in a speech at Harvard university. But who cares what Lagarde says about the future direction of the global economy? As far as the autocratic leaders who fill the UN\u2019s assembly hall are concerned, the IMF served its purpose in the wake of the crash. Now its ideas for greater co-operation, investment and equality are surplus to requirements, like a wool coat in August or a Royal Navy landing ship in a cost-cutting defence review. Not only is the IMF seen as a hand-wringing liberal institution making nuanced and technical suggestions in an age of simpler, broad-brush solutions, it is wedded to a past that both left and right on the political spectrum are beginning to accept will never return. The normality of galloping productivity gains that lead to improving wage rates, bountiful tax receipts and declining government debts is still a long way off, and \u2013 given how much commerce is changing with the growing amount of business conducted over the internet, the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics \u2013 may never return. Not that the IMF is giving up its role as adviser to governments large and small about how they should move forwards. Last week it urged the G20 to focus on \u201crebalancing and ensuring the sustainability of growth, while fine-tuning the macroeconomic policy mix\u201d. Rebalancing refers back to the call for Germany and South Korea to splash some of their spare money on the goods and services of their neighbours. In this way, the balance between debtor and surplus countries would narrow to reduce the risk of another financial crash. Except that no one is listening to the G20 either. Least of all the G20\u2019s own members, despite their enthusiasm for a group created to rebuild the global economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. Mexico, Australia, Canada and Indonesia are keen to keep the global trading routes open with as few barriers as possible. But the majority of G20 of members are, in different ways, turning in on themselves and of the IMF\u2019s recommendations, the most they can probably manage is the fine-tuning. China is about to embark of a phase of introspection as the Communist party wrestles with keeping control amid slowing growth. Germany is busy saving for its ageing baby boomers, while the Trump administration is busy putting America first, which initially means unwinding its trade agreements. The fact that the IMF\u2019s global concerns are lost on its most powerful members means that all eyes in Washington next week will be on the real movers and shakers \u2013 the central bank governors, who turn up en masse for the IMF bash. Yet they have, almost in unison, expressed the limitations of their powers in recent weeks, not least the Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He will be in Washington with Lagarde and may hint again about an interest rate rise in November. Yet he is the first to say that a sustainable future is one only politicians can forge. More turbulence at Ryanair In a sector long beset by turbulence, the eventual crash of Monarch Airlines was predictable \u2013 if still a mighty shock to many staff, and hundreds of thousands of passengers who booked flights without protection. While other airlines, such as Air Berlin and Alitalia, have been kept on life support by their governments, Monarch\u2019s demise was sudden. The venerable brand had lasted almost 50 years, carrying holidaymakers through oil shocks, recession and wars. But Britain\u2019s great survivor could not withstand the latest blows, a combination of terrorism, Brexit uncertainty, a collapsing pound and fierce competition from low-cost airlines. Should other airlines fear trouble ahead? Not necessarily. Consolidation, the bigger aviation beasts like to argue, is inevitable. The effects of oversupply in key markets were fatally evident to Monarch: cheap-as-chips fares to Spain in summer meant its planes would never see the autumn. Monarch was too small to survive, but its demise is going to make life a little easier for rivals; already prices have surged on some routes. The greater ramifications for aviation could yet be in events unfolding at Ryanair, where a failure to factor in pilots\u2019 leave led to two waves of cancellations. The Irish airline meets its own crisis from a vastly different position: cash-rich, leading the European market, with annual profits topping \u00a31bn. Its unremittingly low-cost philosophy has come to dominate aviation. Yet at least one pillar of Ryanair\u2019s economy is wobbling. Pilots, long derided by O\u2019Leary and led into unusual contractual arrangements, have rediscovered their strength. While Ryanair looks to double its customers and awaits the arrival of a new fleet of 737s, it is going to need more people to fly them. Pilots\u2019 salaries are not small: but neither is the investment they make in their training, nor the responsibility they hold. With its work culture in the spotlight, Ryanair is being forced to bump up pay for pilots; cabin crew, who suffer even greater indignities at the hands of Ryanair\u2019s management for far less reward, might wait longer for a rise. Higher costs could mean higher fares. But it is time that Ryanair, which now preaches the virtue of niceness to customers, extended the same courtesy to its own employees. Both sides look to win the Uber battle Transport for London\u2019s surprise banishment of Uber \u2013 and the subsequent bipartisan peace talks \u2013 increasingly feel like carefully staged theatre. The ride-hailing app\u2019s chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi held a t\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate with TfL commissioner Mike Brown last week, a personal touch designed to show he is taking the firm\u2019s reputational struggles seriously. Both TfL and mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed this gesture of contrition and the script is ready for a deal allowing both sides to claim victory. Khosrowshahi need only make minor tweaks to allay TfL\u2019s concerns about driver background checks and reporting of crime. That will cast him as the face of a new era of social responsibility at Uber, while TfL and Khan can boast that they took on a Californian tech giant and won. It would be no great shock if Uber won its licence back by Christmas. But concerns about issues such as labour rights for drivers will linger on.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In common with Sir John Major, Denis Healey, the Bank of England\u2019s historian David Kynaston, and former governor (1983-93) Robin Leigh-Pemberton, I had great reservations about the granting of independence to the Bank. By independence \u2013 more precisely \u201coperational independence\u201d \u2013 was meant control of monetary policy: giving the Bank the power to change interest rates, as opposed to merely offering advice to chancellors and prime ministers that could be ignored. We doubters were mindful of the excessively deflationary bent of the Bank during the interwar years. When the Bank was nationalised by the Attlee government in 1946 \u2013 a reaction to Labour\u2019s problems with the economy and the Bank\u2019s influence in the 1920s \u2013 the Labour peer Lord Passfield said, recalling those troubled interwar years: \u201cNobody told us we could do that.\u201d It was with this history in mind that I was so shocked when Gordon Brown, encouraged, indeed ably assisted, by Ed Balls, granted the Bank independence in a first dramatic act after the 1997 general election. This year sees the 20th anniversary of the granting of independence and, given the depth of the economic problems facing this country, it was a good moment recently for the Bank to hold a public conference, at which Brown, Balls and others were able to reflect on the record of their creation. It is also good timing that Kynaston\u2019s magnificent Till Time\u2019s Last Sand: A History of The Bank of England 1694-2013 has recently been published. At the conference, most of the media coverage concentrated on a speech by Theresa May that had little to do with the Bank, but was billed as a defence of capitalism at the end of a week when most of the press had done its best to pillory Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell for their leftwing programme. But the high spot of the conference was a brilliant presentation by Brown, in which he acknowledged what had gone wrong with the original concept. Few were in doubt that the monetary policy committee had done a pretty good job. The problem had been with the independent Bank\u2019s approach to financial stability, or the lack of it. Inflation has hardly been a problem these past 20 years. It is an open question to what extent this has been due to the central Bank, as opposed to the impact of globalisation and competitive forces emanating from China. Nevertheless, operational independence in monetary policy has worked better than some of us feared; the point was made at the conference that knowledge of the inflation target has probably had a beneficent influence on wage bargainers who, in the past, would assume the worst of the prospect for inflation, and bargain everyone into the kind of wage-price spiral that only ends in disaster. But back to financial stability. It was a theme of the 20th anniversary conference that the newly independent Bank had been asleep at the wheel, both in the run-up to the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 and the immediate aftermath. In particular, the blame fell on the then governor Mervyn, now Lord, King, for allegedly having placed all the emphasis on monetary policy, at the expense of the Bank\u2019s overall responsibility for the financial system; for the Bank still possessed this function, even though day-to-day supervision had been hived off to the Financial Services Authority. Brown was scathing about the behaviour of the governor he had appointed, not only for going on about \u201cmoral hazard\u201d \u2013 ie being reluctant at first to bail out banks for fear it would set a bad example, but also for publicly offering advice on fiscal policy. The deal was supposed to be that the chancellor would not intervene in monetary matters, nor the Bank in matters of public expenditure and taxation\u2013 which King did, negatively, when the economy was nowhere near enjoying sustained recovery from the crisis. All in all, the independent Bank did not emerge well from the crisis, as Kynaston underlines in his book, although he goes out of his way to be fair, noting that some senior officials were not unaware of mounting problems at Northern Rock and elsewhere. Anyway, both Brown and Balls have concluded that lessons have to be learned, and that there needs to be more cooperation between Bank and government in future. One of the ironies they concede is that, by removing decisions on interest rates, which used to take up a lot of ministerial and Treasury time, the hope was that the Treasury would be able to concentrate more on wider economic policy. Well, to judge from the state of the economy now, there is a lot left to be desired when it comes to the achievement of a successful economic policy. This was all too apparent last Monday when, at that bizarre Conservative party conference in Manchester, chancellor Philip Hammond devoted his main thrust to attacking Labour, in the face of whose success with the younger generation the Tories are running scared. But the problems of the economy now are nothing compared with what is to come if our leaders, and the people they are supposed to lead, do not come to their senses and recognise that Brexit has to be stopped. The present Bank governor Mark Carney is well aware of the absurdity of Brexit, but his powers are reduced to damage limitation. Which makes me wonder why a manifest slowdown in the economy now is being met by threats of a rise in interest rates. This Brexit business is an unmitigated disaster. As a senior European politician recently observed of the British: \u201cIt was heroic of you in 1940 to stand on your own against your enemies; it is ridiculous in 2017 to stand on your own against your friends.\u201d",

When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/08/central-bank-england\">the Bank was nationalised by the Attlee government in 1946</a> \u2013 a reaction to Labour\u2019s problems with the economy and the Bank\u2019s influence in the 1920s \u2013 the Labour peer Lord Passfield said, recalling those troubled interwar years: \u201cNobody told us we could do that.\u201d</p> <p>It was with this history in mind that I was so shocked when Gordon Brown, encouraged, indeed ably assisted, by Ed Balls, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/may/07/economy.uk\">granted the Bank independence</a> in a first dramatic act after the 1997 general election.</p> <p>This year sees the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/01/is-the-bank-of-england-losing-its-way\">20th anniversary of the granting of independence</a> and, given the depth of the economic problems facing this country, it was a good moment recently for the Bank to hold a public conference, at which Brown, Balls and others were able to reflect on the record of their creation.</p> <p>It is also good timing that Kynaston\u2019s magnificent <a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/till-time-s-last-sand.html\"><em>Till Time\u2019s Last Sand:</em></a><em> A History of The Bank of England 1694-2013</em> has recently been published.</p> <p>At the conference, most of the media coverage concentrated on a speech by Theresa May that had little to do with the Bank, but was billed as a defence of capitalism at the end of a week when most of the press had done its best to pillory Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell for their leftwing programme.</p> <p>But the high spot of the conference was a brilliant presentation by Brown, in which he acknowledged what had gone wrong with the original concept.</p> <p>Few were in doubt that the monetary policy committee had done a pretty good job. The problem had been with the independent Bank\u2019s approach to financial stability, or the lack of it. Inflation has hardly been a problem these past 20 years. It is an open question to what extent this has been due to the central Bank, as opposed to the impact of globalisation and competitive forces emanating from China. Nevertheless, operational independence in monetary policy has worked better than some of us feared; the point was made at the conference that knowledge of the inflation target has probably had a beneficent influence on wage bargainers who, in the past, would assume the worst of the prospect for inflation, and bargain everyone into the kind of wage-price spiral that only ends in disaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24776a04c6f589a9b4d43549de269c4cc5b4a97b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24776a04c6f589a9b4d43549de269c4cc5b4a97b/0_216_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is threatening a rise in interest rates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is threatening a rise in interest rates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Afolabi Sotunde/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But back to financial stability. It was a theme of the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Pages/conferences/2017/28290917.aspx\">20th anniversary conference</a> that the newly independent Bank had been asleep at the wheel, both in the run-up to the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 and the immediate aftermath. In particular, the blame fell on the then governor Mervyn, now Lord, King, for allegedly having placed all the emphasis on monetary policy, at the expense of the Bank\u2019s overall responsibility for the financial system; for the Bank still possessed this function, even though day-to-day supervision had been hived off to the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>Brown was scathing about the behaviour of the governor he had appointed, not only for going on about \u201cmoral hazard\u201d \u2013 ie being reluctant at first to bail out banks for fear it would set a bad example, but also for publicly offering advice on fiscal policy. The deal was supposed to be that the chancellor would not intervene in monetary matters, nor the Bank in matters of public expenditure and taxation\u2013 which King did, negatively, when the economy was nowhere near enjoying sustained recovery from the crisis.</p> <p>All in all, the independent Bank did not emerge well from the crisis, as Kynaston underlines in his book, although he goes out of his way to be fair, noting that some senior officials were not unaware of mounting problems at Northern Rock and elsewhere. Anyway, both Brown and Balls have concluded that lessons have to be learned, and that there needs to be more cooperation between Bank and government in future.</p> <p>One of the ironies they concede is that, by removing decisions on interest rates, which used to take up a lot of ministerial and Treasury time, the hope was that the Treasury would be able to concentrate more on wider economic policy.</p> <p>Well, to judge from the state of the economy now, there is a lot left to be desired when it comes to the achievement of a successful economic policy. This was all too apparent last Monday when, at that bizarre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/oct/02/conservative-conference-2017-boris-johnson-philip-hammond-tells-boris-johnson-he-is-sackable-politics-live?page=with:block-59d1eb74e4b00d657809cd49#block-59d1eb74e4b00d657809cd49\">Conservative party conference in Manchester, chancellor Philip Hammond</a> devoted his main thrust to attacking Labour, in the face of whose success with the younger generation the Tories are running scared.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/01/is-the-bank-of-england-losing-its-way\">Is the Bank of England losing its way?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the problems of the economy now are nothing compared with what is to come if our leaders, and the people they are supposed to lead, do not come to their senses and recognise that Brexit has to be stopped. The present Bank governor Mark Carney is well aware of the absurdity of Brexit, but his powers are reduced to damage limitation. Which makes me wonder why a manifest slowdown in the economy now is being met by threats of a rise in interest rates.</p> <p>This Brexit business is an unmitigated disaster. As a senior European politician recently observed of the British: \u201cIt was heroic of you in 1940 to stand on your own against your enemies; it is ridiculous in 2017 to stand on your own against your friends.\u201d</p>",

These touchstones of my life may seem sporadic \u2013 the cooking pot I went off to university with, the first towel I bought (rather than stole from my mother), the rucksack I wore during my pregnancy, the changing table that will, I hope, one day serve as my child\u2019s desk \u2013 but they all unite under a single Swedish philosophy: \u201cTo create a better everyday life for the many people.\u201d I didn\u2019t know about this philosophy until I stood, bathed in the gentle air of meatballs, in the foyer of the Ikea Museum in \u00c4lmhult, Sm\u00e5land and read it off a giant white wall beside a portrait of the Ikea founder, Ingvar Kamprad. The museum, which opened in 2016 on the site of Ikea\u2019s first ever store, tells the story not only of Swedish life via its common household objects (not to mention the more arresting ones such as \u201cbog ore\u201d and \u201csausage horn\u201d), but gives a glimpse into the life of Kamprad, his staff, those early furniture experiments (denim divan, anyone?) and the unlikely rise to global proportions of this small, backwood business. If you haven\u2019t heard of \u00c4lmhult, this may be because it is, essentially, a small Swedish town in the middle of the woods, so far south it\u2019s actually closer to Copenhagen than Stockholm, with fewer than 20,000 residents. Imagine a village in the Home Counties, but with more cinnamon buns and where everyone is dressed in H&amp;M. However, it was here, in 1943, that the young entrepreneur, Kamprad, founded his business, moving on from selling cheap matches to neighbours to using the local milkman to distribute small household items across Sweden at a discounted rate. In 1953 there followed his first furniture showroom, in 1956 his first flat-pack furniture and in 1958 his first Ikea store. It would take until 1987 for Ikea to reach the UK, opening its blue and yellow doors for the first time in Warrington. Why Warrington? Why not? If you have a business based on the founding principles of form, function, quality, sustainability and low price, setting up in a northern manufacturing town with plenty of room and a good rate of home ownership doesn\u2019t seem a crazy idea. Thirty years later, it is hard to imagine any student bedroom, any couple\u2019s first flat, home office or granny annexe untouched by the sharp lines of a Billy bookcase, Po\u00e4ng chair, Klippan sofa, Lack table or Ribba picture frame. You might not love them, you might not even remember them, but you own them nonetheless. Just as the font in a good book is the very one you don\u2019t notice, so the ubiquity of Ikea in our homes has rendered the Kallax unit, the Fargrik mug and Fado lamp near-invisible. During my trip to \u00c4lmhult, and after filling up on a cheese and crispbread brunch at Icom \u2013 the Ikea communications department \u2013 one of Ikea\u2019s longest-serving staff members (a Danish woman in an immaculate white shirt) let me into the company\u2019s little inside joke about those \u201cfunny\u201d Scandinavian names. It goes that while the sofas are given Swedish place names and the beds are named after towns in Norway, the Danish place names are reserved especially for toilet brushes. These days, Ikea can sometimes feel like an emblem of the northern European, socially democratic future we could have won: a principal partner of the Living Wage Foundation with a strict 50/50 gender split target for management teams across the globe. Ikea also serves under founder Kamprad\u2019s philosophy that waste is a \u201cmortal sin\u201d. As we sat in a small, white room surrounded by LED lights and flooring made from recycled wood, Nanette Weisdal, the company\u2019s sustainability leader, explained to me that their code of conduct strives to achieve ever higher rates of recycling, reuse and repair, and to source sustainable materials, labour and products across the world. Afterwards I strolled across the carpark from the Ikea Museum canteen to the Ikea hotel under a light Swedish drizzle and wondered what comes next for the company and for me, a customer. Today, as the company prepares to open its first store in India, I scroll through baby bouncers and nursing chairs. As they deploy more than 16,000 flat-pack refugee shelters to crisis locations from Nepal to Baghdad to Dijbouti, I wonder what sort of world my child, rolling about in his Charmtroll sleeping bag, will inherit. And as we prepare to be cut adrift from the safety, protection and culture of the EU, will we look north to our Scandinavian cousins, or turn inward in a fit of nationalism? Either way, one thing is for sure: home will never be the same again.",

      "bodyText": "Right now there is a growing disconnect between how business and consumers view the economy. It is a gap that will continue to widen as measures of the economy suggest things are on the improve, but wages continue to grow at record low rates. And it is a gap which will have a significant impact on how voters judge the government\u2019s economic achievements at the next election. This month the NAB measure of business conditions hit its highest level since early 2008. In the same month the latest Westpac Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment revealed that \u201cthe consumer mood remains downbeat with September marking the tenth consecutive month that pessimists have outnumbered optimists\u201d. For businesses, things are seemingly as good as they have been since the GFC hit, and yet consumers still feel little joy. And this week came proof that this consumer sentiment was not just a \u201cvibe\u201d but was reflected in how they were spending their money. The ABS revealed on Thursday that in August, Australians spent 0.6% less on retail goods and services than they had in July \u2013 the biggest one-month fall in spending since March 2013. And we can\u2019t even argue it is just a one-off blip \u2013 the annual growth of retail spending is also the lowest it has been for four years. Worst of all it is across the entire country. Every state and territory saw retail spending fall in August. That doesn\u2019t happen very often \u2013 the last time it did was in June 2009. And even if we take the view that this is all a statistical flub and we should use the more sober trend figures, things are not good. In August no state or territory saw retail trade grow by more than 0.15% in trend terms. That has never happened before. Everywhere you look, people are closing their wallets \u2013 and this at a time when full-time employment is growing stronger than it has for six years and the unemployment rate is as low as it has been since early 2013. The collapse in spending was also across almost all areas \u2013 food, household goods, clothing and accessories, cafes, restaurants and takeaways all saw a drop in spending. The only good news was for department stores, but that was of little consequence given in the past year spending in department stores is down 1.4%. The problem is that Australia\u2019s economy is built not on the back of sheep or even from what we dig out of holes, but on household spending. Household consumption makes up about 56% of our entire GDP, and over the past decade spending by households has accounted for a similar proportion of the growth of our economy. By contrast, in the past 10 years net exports have accounted for just 3% of the total growth of the economy. When household spending slows down, so too does the entire the economy. Fortunately, not all consumer spending is on retail trade \u2013 it makes up roughly a quarter of all spending by households \u2013 but it is a very good indicator of how households are spending. The problem is that much of the other household expenditure, such as on education, health, insurance, rent and utilities, is less driven by choice \u2013 you have to pay it. It means if the prices of non-retail items go up, less household income is available to be spent on things you would buy down at the local shopping mall or supermarket. The only way to keep pace is if household income also rises. And that is where these terrible retail figures really hit home. In the past year in Sydney, for example, the price of non-retail items has risen faster than that of retail goods. Childcare in Sydney rose 6%, electricity 10.5%, medical and hospital services 5.2%, transport fares 4.4%, and property rates and charges rose 3.1%. At the same time the average wage of workers in NSW rose just 2.0%. Something has to give, and what is giving at the moment is people\u2019s capacity to spend at the shops. Over time economies change, and what is important also changes. In the past we used to just look at the unemployment rate and pretty much assume that told the whole story. Now, with increased numbers of people working part-time, we know we need to look at other measures such as the underemployment rate, or hours worked. Until the GFC hit the main issue with wages was whether they were growing too fast \u2013 whether Australia was becoming uncompetitive, or that the Reserve Bank would need to increase interest rates to calm things down. Most often the release of the quarterly wage figures were used as an excuse for conservative politicians and commentators to suggest the unions were out of control. In the 10 years from 1999 to the end of 2008, private-sector wages grew on average by 3.6%. They have not grown at that pace for five years \u2013 and will not get close to that pace any time soon. The May budget predicted wages growth returning to that level only by June 2020 \u2013 and even that requires some pretty extraordinary things to occur. Wages growth is now a key indicator of economic health. And while wages continue to grow at such low levels \u2013 currently below inflation \u2013 households will continue to act logically by spending less at the shops. It also means that other economic news, no matter how \u201cgood\u201d, will continue to pale in significance \u2013 both economically and politically.",

      "body": "<p>Right now there is a growing disconnect between how business and consumers view the economy. It is a gap that will continue to widen as measures of the economy suggest things are on the improve, but wages continue to grow at record low rates. And it is a gap which will have a significant impact on how voters judge the government\u2019s economic achievements at the next election. </p> <p>This month <a href=\"https://business.nab.com.au/nab-monthly-business-survey-august-2017-26268/\">the NAB measure of business conditions</a> hit its highest level since early 2008. In the same month the latest <a href=\"https://www.westpac.com.au/content/dam/public/wbc/documents/pdf/aw/economics-research/er20170913BullConsumerSentiment.pdf\">Westpac Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment</a> revealed that \u201cthe consumer mood remains downbeat with September marking the tenth consecutive month that pessimists have outnumbered optimists\u201d. </p> <p>For businesses, things are seemingly as good as they have been since the GFC hit, and yet consumers still feel little joy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/05/australias-shocker-retail-spending-figures-raise-christmas-trade-concerns\">Australia's 'shocker' retail spending figures raise growth concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And this week came proof that this consumer sentiment was not just a \u201cvibe\u201d but was reflected in how they were spending their money. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/8501.0Main+Features1Aug%202017?OpenDocument\">ABS revealed on Thursday</a> that in August, Australians spent 0.6% less on retail goods and services than they had in July \u2013 the biggest one-month fall in spending since March 2013. And we can\u2019t even argue it is just a one-off blip \u2013 the annual growth of retail spending is also the lowest it has been for four years. </p> <p>Worst of all it is across the entire country. </p> <p>Every state and territory saw retail spending fall in August. That doesn\u2019t happen very often \u2013 the last time it did was in June 2009. And even if we take the view that this is all a statistical flub and we should use the more sober trend figures, things are not good. In August no state or territory saw retail trade grow by more than 0.15% in trend terms. </p> <p>That has never happened before. </p> <p>Everywhere you look, people are closing their wallets \u2013 and this at a time when full-time employment is growing stronger than it has for six years and the unemployment rate is as low as it has been since early 2013. </p> <p>The collapse in spending was also across almost all areas \u2013 food, household goods, clothing and accessories, cafes, restaurants and takeaways all saw a drop in spending. The only good news was for department stores, but that was of little consequence given in the past year spending in department stores is down 1.4%.</p> <p>The problem is that Australia\u2019s economy is built not on the back of sheep or even from what we dig out of holes, but on household spending. </p> <p>Household consumption makes up about 56% of our entire GDP, and over the past decade spending by households has accounted for a similar proportion of the growth of our economy. By contrast, in the past 10 years net exports have accounted for just 3% of the total growth of the economy. </p> <p>When household spending slows down, so too does the entire the economy. </p> <p>Fortunately, not all consumer spending is on retail trade \u2013 it makes up roughly a quarter of all spending by households \u2013 but it is a very good indicator of how households are spending. The problem is that much of the other household expenditure, such as on education, health, insurance, rent and utilities, is less driven by choice \u2013 you have to pay it. </p> <p>It means if the prices of non-retail items go up, less household income is available to be spent on things you would buy down at the local shopping mall or supermarket. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/sep/14/flat-household-incomes-means-more-of-the-budget-goes-on-basics\">Households forced to abandon luxuries and spend more of the budget on basics | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only way to keep pace is if household income also rises. </p> <p>And that is where these terrible retail figures really hit home. </p> <p>In the past year in Sydney, for example, the price of non-retail items has risen faster than that of retail goods. Childcare in Sydney rose 6%, electricity 10.5%, medical and hospital services 5.2%, transport fares 4.4%, and property rates and charges rose 3.1%. </p> <p>At the same time the average wage of workers in NSW rose just 2.0%.</p> <p>Something has to give, and what is giving at the moment is people\u2019s capacity to spend at the shops. </p> <p>Over time economies change, and what is important also changes.
