In any case, Mario Draghi, ECB president, said last month that he and colleagues would be comfortable taking action in June. But what action? A cut in the main interest rate from 0.25% to 0.15% or 0.1% seems certain.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "One million fewer customer visits a week at Tesco", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco appears to have lost more than 1 million customer visits a week, worth \u00a325m in sales, with its market share showing the biggest decline for at least 20 years. In the 12 weeks to 25 May, Tesco's sales fell 3.1% from a year earlier and Morrisons' sales dipped 3.9%, according to figures compiled by Kantar Worldpanel. Kantar said the grocery market was at its weakest for at least 11 years. Tesco's market share dropped to 29% from 30.5%, while Morrisons' share fell to 10.9% from 11.6%. The drop in Tesco's share is the highest since Kantar's records began in 1994. Analyst David McCarthy at HSBC said the figures were shocking. He said: \"The market is in danger of getting desensitised to bad figures from [Tesco, Morrison and Sainsbury], but this would be a mistake. These figures from Kantar are shocking, in our view, and show that Tesco's and Morrison's total sales are going backwards, despite huge investment. Tesco looks like it is experiencing more than 1 million fewer customer visits per week on a like-for-like basis (we assume average expenditure of \u00a325 per lost visit).\" The performance of Tesco and Morrisons contrasts with the rise of Aldi and Lidl, the German budget grocers, whose sales surged by 35.9% and 22.7% respectively. The figures make grim reading for Tesco before Wednesday's trading update from Britain's biggest supermarket chain. In April, Tesco reported a second year of falling sales and profits in its core UK business. Chief executive Philip Clarke has scaled back Tesco's international operations to concentrate on its ailing UK operations, but investors are yet to see returns from his spending on store revamps and limited price cuts. Britain's big supermarkets have suffered as hard-up consumers have reined in spending and turned to the German value chains for their basic shopping. Shareholders fear an all-out price war as the big four, often lumbered with giant out-of-town stores, seek to combat the rise of the nimbler value chains. Aldi's market share rose to 4.7% from 3.5% and Lidl's hit 3.6%, up from 3%. Some investors want Clarke to use Tesco's financial power to meet the value chains head on with a huge programme of price cuts to reclaim its reputation for value. Instead, he has offered reduced prices on everyday items such as bacon, eggs and bread and promised more predictable prices to shoppers fed up with confusing promotions and big price swings. Edward Garner, director at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \"The short-term challenge for Tesco is, how do you respond? Competing on price is a problem for Tesco and Morrisons, because unless people believe you and flock to your shops, the effect is to reduce your profits. In the long term, Tesco is trying to distinguish itself with store refits. If you are being charitable to Philip Clarke, you would say he has to hold firm and say that these investments will improve things.\" Total sales in the grocery market rose just 1.7%, the slowest rate since 2003. Grocery inflation was 1.2% in the period covered by Kantar's research \u2013 the lowest rate for four years \u2013 as Aldi and Lidl put pressure on the big supermarkets to compete on price. Garner said that taking into account inflation and Britain's increasing population, the underlying grocery market was probably not growing at all. Morrisons, which has been hit hardest by the German upstarts, has promised to spend \u00a31bn over three years on price cuts and investments in stores to win back customers. It announced 1,200 price cuts on everyday items last month under the strapline \"I'm cheaper\". Sainsbury's sales rose by 0.9%, and its market share increased from 16.5% to 16.7%. Under Justin King, its departing chief executive, Sainsbury's has managed to maintain a fine balance between price and quality. Asda, owned by Wal-Mart of the US, was the only big-four supermarket to increase sales in the Kantar survey, registering a 2.4% increase while maintaining its market share at 17.1% as it cut prices. At the upper end of the market, Waitrose has eaten into the big four's business by offering high-quality produce, roomy stores and high levels of customer service. It continued its strong performance with a 6.1% increase in sales and a small rise in market share to 5.1% from 4.9%. \u2022 This story was amended on the 4 June 2014. An earlier version wrongly stated that \"Sainsbury's sales also fell, by 0.9%, and its market share edged down to 16.5% from 16.7%\". This has been corrected.",

In the 12 weeks to 25 May, Tesco's sales fell 3.1% from a year earlier and Morrisons' sales dipped 3.9%, according to figures compiled by Kantar Worldpanel.</p> <p>Kantar said the grocery market was at its weakest for at least 11 years. Tesco's market share dropped to 29% from 30.5%, while Morrisons' share fell to 10.9% from 11.6%. The drop in Tesco's share is the highest since Kantar's records began in 1994.</p> <p>Analyst David McCarthy at HSBC said the figures were shocking.</p> <p>He said: \"The market is in danger of getting desensitised to bad figures from [Tesco, Morrison and Sainsbury], but this would be a mistake. These figures from Kantar are shocking, in our view, and show that Tesco's and Morrison's total sales are going backwards, despite huge investment. Tesco looks like it is experiencing more than 1 million fewer customer visits per week on a like-for-like basis (we assume average expenditure of \u00a325 per lost visit).\"</p> <p>The performance of Tesco and Morrisons contrasts with the rise of Aldi and Lidl, the German budget grocers, whose sales surged by 35.9% and 22.7% respectively.</p> <p>The figures make grim reading for Tesco before Wednesday's trading update from Britain's biggest supermarket chain. In April, Tesco reported a second year of falling sales and profits in its core UK business. Chief executive Philip Clarke has scaled back Tesco's international operations to concentrate on its ailing UK operations, but investors are yet to see returns from his spending on store revamps and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/22/tesco-cuts-prices-click-and-collect\" title=\"\">limited price cuts</a>.</p> <p>Britain's big supermarkets have suffered as hard-up consumers have reined in spending and turned to the German value chains for their basic shopping. Shareholders fear an all-out price war as the big four, often lumbered with giant out-of-town stores, seek to combat the rise of the nimbler value chains.</p> <p>Aldi's market share rose to 4.7% from 3.5% and Lidl's hit 3.6%, up from 3%.</p> <p>Some investors want Clarke to use Tesco's financial power to meet the value chains head on with a huge programme of price cuts to reclaim its reputation for value. Instead, he has offered reduced prices on everyday items such as bacon, eggs and bread and promised more predictable prices to shoppers fed up with confusing promotions and big price swings.</p> <p>Edward Garner, director at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \"The short-term challenge for Tesco is, how do you respond? Competing on price is a problem for Tesco and Morrisons, because unless people believe you and flock to your shops, the effect is to reduce your profits. In the long term, Tesco is trying to distinguish itself with store refits. If you are being charitable to Philip Clarke, you would say he has to hold firm and say that these investments will improve things.\"</p> <p>Total sales in the grocery market rose just 1.7%, the slowest rate since 2003. Grocery inflation was 1.2% in the period covered by Kantar's research \u2013 the lowest rate for four years \u2013 as Aldi and Lidl put pressure on the big supermarkets to compete on price.</p> <p>Garner said that taking into account inflation and Britain's increasing population, the underlying grocery market was probably not growing at all.</p> <p>Morrisons, which has been hit hardest by the German upstarts, has promised to spend \u00a31bn over three years on price cuts and investments in stores to win back customers. It announced 1,200 price cuts on everyday items last month under the strapline \"I'm cheaper\".</p> <p>Sainsbury's sales rose by 0.9%, and its market share increased from 16.5% to 16.7%. Under Justin King, its departing chief executive, Sainsbury's has managed to maintain a fine balance between price and quality.</p> <p>Asda, owned by Wal-Mart of the US, was the only big-four supermarket to increase sales in the Kantar survey, registering a 2.4% increase while maintaining its market share at 17.1% as it cut prices.</p> <p>At the upper end of the market, Waitrose has eaten into the big four's business by offering high-quality produce, roomy stores and high levels of customer service. It continued its strong performance with a 6.1% increase in sales and a small rise in market share to 5.1% from 4.9%.</p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on the 4 June 2014. An earlier version wrongly stated that \"Sainsbury's sales also fell, by 0.9%, and its market share edged down to 16.5% from 16.7%\". This has been corrected.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The European central bank will almost certainly act this week to breathe life into the eurozone's struggling economy after a shock fall in inflation, economists said. An unexpected fall in annual inflation to 0.5% in May from 0.7% in April appeared to seal the case for additional stimulus when the ECB announces its June policy decision on Thursday. It remains well below the ECB's target of just under 2%, and surprised economists polled by Reuters who had forecast no change. James Ashley, chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets, described the data as \"abysmal\", adding: \"It almost goes without saying that the ECB will be forced to act on Thursday. The fact that we have yet more downside news today merely serves to validate the seemingly universal expectations for action this week.\" Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING, said action from the ECB now appeared to be \"a stone cold certainty\". The options include a cut in the eurozone's main interest rate from a current historic low of 0.25% to 0.15% or lower, as well as a cut in the rate of interest paid on bank deposits, taking it from zero into negative territory. The ECB could also announce plans to buy packages of business loans. Mario Draghi, the bank's president, has so far resisted calls to tackle low inflation, but dropped a strong hint last month that he was about to relent, declaring that the governing council was \"comfortable\" with the idea of action in June. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has been among those to raise concerns that \"lowflation\" will persist against the backdrop of a sluggish recovery in the 18-nation eurozone, urging the ECB to act. The fear is that weak price pressures could ultimately trigger a dangerous deflationary spiral, where consumers and businesses put off spending amid expectations that prices will fall further still. May's fall in inflation dragged the annual rate back down to March's four-and-a-half year low. Eurostat, the region's statistics office, said food, alcohol and tobacco prices rose by just 0.1% in May compared with a year earlier, while energy prices were flat, as were non-energy industrial goods prices. Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, fell to 0.7% from 1% in April. Economists said the fall in that rate partly reflected a normalisation following April's Easter-related rise, but also indicated broader weakness in underlying price pressures. A sustained recovery has yet to take hold in the eurozone, with growth slowing to 0.2% in the first quarter, down from 0.4% in the previous quarter. There was some slightly better news from the labour market on Tuesday, as the unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to 11.7% in April, from 11.8% in March. The number of people out of work fell by 76,000 to 18.75 million. But the headline figure hid big disparities between the 18 member states. The lowest jobless rates were recorded in Austria at 4.9% and Germany at 5.2%. Greece had the highest rate, at 26.5% in February, followed by Spain at 25.1%. Youth unemployment also fell in the eurozone, by 202,000 to 3.38 million people. The rate fell to 23.5% from 23.9% in March. But more than half of young people in Greece and Spain do not have a job.",

      "bodyText": "The chances of AstraZeneca developing future blockbuster drugs appeared to increase on Tuesday as it reported positive results for the major new cancer treatments at the centre of last month's successful defence against a \u00a369bn takeover proposal by Pfizer. In a statement issued to the stock exchange on Tuesday morning, the Anglo-Swedish firm presented clinical data on its lung cancer treatments AZD9291 and MEDI4736, as well as the results of an intermediate phase II study conducted by the US National Cancer Institute on an ovarian cancer treatment, to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). All three were showing progress. John Ansell, an independent pharmaceutical consultant, said: \"There is a good chance that AstraZeneca has got some blockbusters of the future. It would not have stuck its neck out over the past few weeks if it didn't think the trials would have had good results.

The ECB is stepping up its monitoring of banks' ability to pay hefty fines as France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, waits to hear whether it will be hit with a fine in excess of $10bn for its alleged flouting of US sanctions.</p> <p>In February, BNP said it had set aside $1.1 bn to cover the potential U.S. penalty, but two months later, admitted that fines \"could be far in excess\" of that.<br></p> <p>Here is a flavour of the <b>Wall Street Journal </b>report:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It isn't clear how European regulators might tweak their stress tests to estimate the potential costs of investigations.</p> <p>The exams, being conducted on 124 banks by the ECB and the European Banking Authority, are already under way. Results are expected in October. Banks that flunk the test will need to come up with new capital to fortify themselves against future losses.</p> <p>Modeling losses on bad loans in a deteriorating economic environment is relatively straightforward because regulators can apply uniform loss rates to different types of assets. But the size of a regulatory penalty is much harder to anticipate. That is partly because it hinges on subjective factors such as whether authorities detect a pattern in a bank's misconduct and perceive a bank as having been cooperative during the investigation.</p> <p>ECB officials have told bank executives that they want to avoid a situation where the stress tests give a clean bill of health to a bank that, months later, sees its capital buffers severely eroded by a major financial penalty, according to the industry officials.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/03/france-backs-bnp-paribas-us-fine-threat\">France backs BNP Paribas over US threat to fine it $10bn</a></b></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-538dc2cbe4b0a164d99a0838\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-03T12:43:16.888Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As Duncan Weldon points out, there is also an interesting German story in the ONS statistics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/473794452117790720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>A decade ago Germany had the highest unemployment in the G7, now it has the second lowest.</p>&mdash; Duncan Weldon (@DuncanWeldon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/473794452117790720\">June 3, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-06-03T12:43:35.102Z\">at 1.43pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-538dbecde4b0bf7ee4de0295\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-03T12:40:00.606Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cc37dd6d-66ba-4976-9aa3-21480a26dd02\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/3/1401799580901/a29c4cfe-0d33-43a5-9c78-c4e42b58bb5d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"George Osborne at the CBI annual dinner in London last month.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Osborne at the CBI annual dinner in London last month. photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some good news for chancellor George Osborne: the UK has one of the fastest-growing economies in the G7, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/elmr/gdp-and-the-labour-market/q1-2014--may-gdp-update/sty-gdp-g7-economies.html\">latest batch of statistics</a> from the ONS.</p> <p>The UK is the world's 8th biggest economy, but has the 4th highest GDP per capita - at $36,333 (\u00a321,668) a head compared to the US with $51,708, according to an ONS report on GDP and the labour market.</p> <p>But there have been ups and downs: between 2000 and 2007, the UK experienced the highest real wage growth of any G7 country (14%), but has since seen the biggest fall (5.1%). </p> <p>The fact that the UK is growing faster than many developed countries is not new.

The bank cut interest rates for the first time in a year last month, despite high inflation, after calls for a rate cut from the prime minister.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-538da993e4b0b44d86b15b5e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-03T11:04:46.152Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone inflation slides: what the economists say</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0a4f55ef-1588-4312-9d06-d3b387274dac\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/3/1401793121109/7dc7c9cd-2899-4447-a139-3bee0e857b6c-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"A group of Portuguese artists have demonstrated their discontent at economic policy by graffiting on the walls of Lisbon.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of Portuguese artists have demonstrated their discontent at economic policy by graffiting on the walls of Lisbon.

It is hoped that interest rate cuts will boost demand by increasing credit and discouraging the holding of cash balances. Boosting inflation is particularly important for Eurozone members with high debt burdens, as this helps to reduce the real value of repayments.</p> <p> In reality, however, Cebr believe this cut is probably too little too late, and will have a minimal impact the Eurozone\u2019s economic outlook. Another potential policy change on Thursday, long-term refinancing operations aimed at expanding credit provision to small businesses, may be more successful in boosting economic activity and raising inflation.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Dominic Rossi</b>, global chief investment officer at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, says the European Central Bank has sat on its hands for too long:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"The ECB has consistently underestimated the deflationary forces threatening Europe and now is the time for unconventional monetary policy\".</p> </blockquote> <p><b>ING </b>said that fresh action from the ECB is a \"stone cold certainty\"....</p> <p>...while <b>RBC Capital Markets</b> said the inflation data was \"abysmal\".</p> <p><b>Howard Archer </b>of IHS Global Insight predicts rate cuts, and new measures to drive liquidity to eurozone firms:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00b7 <b>Given that one of its main aims is to weaken the euro, the ECB seems highly likely to cut its refinancing rate from 0.25% to 0.15% or 0.10% and to take its deposit rate modestly into negative territory (from 0.0% to -0.1% or -0.15%). </b>While the ECB has previously seemingly baulked at taking its deposit rate into negative territory, it now appears to believe that a full lowering of the interest rate corridor would be most effective rather than just trimming the refinancing rate.</p> <p>\u00b7 <b>The ECB will highly likely enact some liquidity measures in June. </b>The ECB could very well do another Long-Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) which may well be tailored specifically towards lifting bank lending to businesses, especially smaller ones. This could be along the lines of the Bank of England\u2019s Funding for Lending Scheme. The ECB could also stop sterilizing the money it spent buying sovereign bonds during the Eurozone's debt crisis under its now-terminated Securities Markets Program (SMP). The ECB is also keen to revive the market for Asset Backed Securities (ABS) so it could also announce some measures in this area.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <b>Jane Foley of Rabobank </b>warns that the ECB risks sending the euro soaring if it disappoints on Thursday:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not only does the ECB have a desire the increase the policy support to SMEs within the region but the disinflationary environment has stoked a clear preference for a softer currency. </p> <p> Since his warnings last month that policy action is likely in June, the EUR has dropped 1.7% vs. the US dollar. The test for Draghi this week will be to avoid disappointing the market which could result in a \u2018buy on the rumour, sell on the fact\u2019 reaction in the euro. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-06-03T11:08:05.016Z\">at 12.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-538da249e4b0bf7ee4de027b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-03T10:28:34.975Z\">11.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>All the eurozone unemployment rates, all on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/KaiPflughaupt/status/473770236639199232/photo/1\">one graph</a>!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KaiPflughaupt/statuses/473770236639199232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Unemployment Rates in Europe <a href=\"http://t.co/EO8DXnTAsp\">pic.twitter.com/EO8DXnTAsp</a></p>&mdash;

      "bodyText": "Following this morning's eurozone inflation data, Capital Economics asks whether the currency bloc is turning into Japan, facing a 'lost decade' of falling prices and a weak economy. Low inflation might sound like good news for Greece, Spain and Italy and Portugal, but is actually a sign of weakness and falling output in these economies, according to the consultancy, which tends to take a bearish, Eurosceptic line. And Capital Economics warns that the risk of one of these countries falling out of the currency union has not gone away. \uf0b7 The key point though is that euro-zone does not need to turn Japanese to cause serious problems for the indebted peripheral countries. Even low positive inflation will make it very hard for them to restore their competitiveness versus the core economies and to prevent their debt ratios from rising. Against that background, and notwithstanding the markets\u2019 recent optimism, the risk that one or more of those countries might yet seek a different route back to economic and fiscal health \u2013 perhaps via default, perhaps even via exit from the currency union \u2013 has not yet fully evaporated. A summary of key eurozone data can be found here and full reaction from economists here. It is time for me to wrap up today's blog. Thank you for following and for all your comments. A new Italian centre-left prime minister; a new push to privatise a swathe of Italy's shrinking economy. Pier Carlo Padoan has confirmed that the government aims to privatise a chunk of the economy equivalent to 0.7% of Italy's gross domestic product. At a news conference in Rome he said We targeted privatisation receipts of 0.7% of output in our Economic and Financial Document and we think that is still valid.\ufeff A few more details from the Wall Street Journal's man in Rome There could be more than a crackle of tension at the next get-together of EU leaders. Radek Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, and a prime candidate to become the EU's next foreign policy chief, has called on France to cancel a \u20ac1.2 bn contract to sell Mistral helicopter carriers to Russia. In an interview with Le Monde, Sikorski said the helicopters could be used to threaten other European nations. Asked if France should deliver the two vessels, he said: No, because Russian generals have already said what these ships will be used for: to threaten Russia's neighbours in the Black Sea and that means Europe's partners. I don't think France would want to be in the position of supplying efficient weapons to an aggressor. According to Reuters, Barack Obama will also bring up the Mistral sale when he meets French president Francois Hollande for dinner and bilateral talks on Thursday. Poor Mr Hollande must then dash to a separate dinner meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin. A bit off-topic, but AP have a good article on this tricky logistical challenge. The Wall Street Journal has a very interesting story about the European Central Bank's response to the wave of misconduct penalties against European banks. The ECB is stepping up its monitoring of banks' ability to pay hefty fines as France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, waits to hear whether it will be hit with a fine in excess of $10bn for its alleged flouting of US sanctions. In February, BNP said it had set aside $1.1 bn to cover the potential U.S. penalty, but two months later, admitted that fines \"could be far in excess\" of that. Here is a flavour of the Wall Street Journal report: It isn't clear how European regulators might tweak their stress tests to estimate the potential costs of investigations. The exams, being conducted on 124 banks by the ECB and the European Banking Authority, are already under way. Results are expected in October. Banks that flunk the test will need to come up with new capital to fortify themselves against future losses. Modeling losses on bad loans in a deteriorating economic environment is relatively straightforward because regulators can apply uniform loss rates to different types of assets. But the size of a regulatory penalty is much harder to anticipate. That is partly because it hinges on subjective factors such as whether authorities detect a pattern in a bank's misconduct and perceive a bank as having been cooperative during the investigation. ECB officials have told bank executives that they want to avoid a situation where the stress tests give a clean bill of health to a bank that, months later, sees its capital buffers severely eroded by a major financial penalty, according to the industry officials. France backs BNP Paribas over US threat to fine it $10bn As Duncan Weldon points out, there is also an interesting German story in the ONS statistics. Some good news for chancellor George Osborne: the UK has one of the fastest-growing economies in the G7, according to the latest batch of statistics from the ONS. The UK is the world's 8th biggest economy, but has the 4th highest GDP per capita - at $36,333 (\u00a321,668) a head compared to the US with $51,708, according to an ONS report on GDP and the labour market. But there have been ups and downs: between 2000 and 2007, the UK experienced the highest real wage growth of any G7 country (14%), but has since seen the biggest fall (5.1%). The fact that the UK is growing faster than many developed countries is not new. Some might say it can be detected in this smug response from HM Treasury to a European Commission suggestion that the government might build more homes and take other steps to bring down property prices. The Treasury said that as one of the fastest growing economies, the UK would listen to the commission with interest. Jennifer Rankin taking over from GW on the blog. Turning away from the eurozone, in Turkey the prime minister has fallen out with the country's central bank. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who faced large protests anti-government protests last year and more recently has been embroiled in a corruption scandal, continues to put pressure on the Turkish central bank. Erdogan has criticised central bank governor Erdem Basci for not cutting interest rates enough. After Basci presented the latest economic data to the Turkish cabinet, Erdogan again criticised the bank's approach. These are routine presentations but I do not find his approach concerning interest rates at all positive and I do not accept it..I hope that new steps are taken immediately and this issue is resolved Via Reuters Erdogan, who has already served three terms as prime minister and could be a candidate for the presidency in August elections, is keen to maintain Turkey's economic growth. The bank cut interest rates for the first time in a year last month, despite high inflation, after calls for a rate cut from the prime minister. There is broad agreement that the European Central Bank needs to take decisive action on Thursday in response to weakening inflation and high unemployment (see 10am onwards for full coverage). Tom Rogers, senior economic adviser to consultancy EY, says today's data: underlines the fragility of the eurozone recovery, the lack of improvement in the labor market in most economies, and the persistence of the deflationary threat.\" Katie Evans, economist at CEBR, warns that simply cutting interest rates isn't good enough: Given the continued weakness in today\u2019s data, the ECB are widely expected to cut interest rates to a level below zero this week, meaning banks will be charged to hold reserves there. It is hoped that interest rate cuts will boost demand by increasing credit and discouraging the holding of cash balances. Boosting inflation is particularly important for Eurozone members with high debt burdens, as this helps to reduce the real value of repayments. In reality, however, Cebr believe this cut is probably too little too late, and will have a minimal impact the Eurozone\u2019s economic outlook. Another potential policy change on Thursday, long-term refinancing operations aimed at expanding credit provision to small businesses, may be more successful in boosting economic activity and raising inflation. Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, says the European Central Bank has sat on its hands for too long: \"The ECB has consistently underestimated the deflationary forces threatening Europe and now is the time for unconventional monetary policy\". ING said that fresh action from the ECB is a \"stone cold certainty\".... ...while RBC Capital Markets said the inflation data was \"abysmal\". Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicts rate cuts, and new measures to drive liquidity to eurozone firms: \u00b7 Given that one of its main aims is to weaken the euro, the ECB seems highly likely to cut its refinancing rate from 0.25% to 0.15% or 0.10% and to take its deposit rate modestly into negative territory (from 0.0% to -0.1% or -0.15%). While the ECB has previously seemingly baulked at taking its deposit rate into negative territory, it now appears to believe that a full lowering of the interest rate corridor would be most effective rather than just trimming the refinancing rate. \u00b7 The ECB will highly likely enact some liquidity measures in June. The ECB could very well do another Long-Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) which may well be tailored specifically towards lifting bank lending to businesses, especially smaller ones. This could be along the lines of the Bank of England\u2019s Funding for Lending Scheme. The ECB could also stop sterilizing the money it spent buying sovereign bonds during the Eurozone's debt crisis under its now-terminated Securities Markets Program (SMP). The ECB is also keen to revive the market for Asset Backed Securities (ABS) so it could also announce some measures in this area. And Jane Foley of Rabobank warns that the ECB risks sending the euro soaring if it disappoints on Thursday: Not only does the ECB have a desire the increase the policy support to SMEs within the region but the disinflationary environment has stoked a clear preference for a softer currency. Since his warnings last month that policy action is likely in June, the EUR has dropped 1.7% vs. the US dollar. The test for Draghi this week will be to avoid disappointing the market which could result in a \u2018buy on the rumour, sell on the fact\u2019 reaction in the euro. All the eurozone unemployment rates, all on one graph! Weak inflation isn't the only problem facing the eurozone, of course -- it is also being hampered by a fractured banking sector where companies in the Southern periphery face much higher borrowing costs than their Northern rivals. fastFT just published this chart, via Bank of America Merrill Lynch, showing how Spanish firms face much higher real interest rates than, say, those in Germany. That higher cost of credit makes it harder for Spanish firms to compete, expand, take on more staff and help the eurozone economy recover. That's why the ECB could launch a version of the UK's Funding For Lending scheme, to drive borrowing costs down. Incidentally....financial writer George Cooper has blogged about how variable credit costs drive inequality, as the rich can borrow so much cheaper than the poor can. As the profitability of any business venture is a function of the gap between the cost of capital and return on capital, it follows that any given venture will be more profitable, and less risky, to those who can borrow money at the lowest possible rates. For this reason there are more potentially viable business ventures available to the rich than to the poor \u2013 as the saying goes: \u2018the first million is always the hardest\u2019. Worth a read Another chart - showing how food, inflation and tobacco inflation has weakened steadily over the last year. This chart shows how May's eurozone inflation rate dipped back to the 0.5% level seen in March, while 'core inflation' (a better measure of underlying price pressures) is back at its record lows of 0.7%. Both fell further away from the ECB target of just below 2%. Economist Megan Greene warns that the eurozone jobless rate remains so high that it is helping to force euro inflation down, even though it dipped a little in April: IHS economist Howard Archer says the European Central Bank hardly needed another reason to act on Thursday: ...but if the ECB was at all unsure of the need for strong action then the dip in Eurozone consumer price inflation to just 0.5% in May surely gave the Governing Council a final shove towards cutting interest rates and also announcing liquidity measures. The euro hasn't been hit by the slump in eurozone inflation to 0.5%; it's still hovering around $1.36. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, says traders already expected the ECB to act on Thursday. This is reinforcing expectations that the ECB will take action at this Thursday\u2019s monetary policy meeting by cutting interest rates and/or introducing a negative deposit rate for banks. The euro/US dollar briefly dipped below 1.36, but it hasn\u2019t moved too much, as investors already fully expect the central bank to take action in two days\u2019 time. So, what caused the slump in eurozone inflation last month to just 0.5%, further from the ECB's 2% target. Eurostat reports that food, tobacco and alcohol inflation fell sharply in May - down to just 0.1% in May compared to 0.7% in April (when prices may have been pushed up by demand at Easter). And there was no inflation at all in non-energy industrial goods. Energy prices were also unchanged, as this chart shows. Falling energy prices have been blamed for dragging down eurozone inflation - but clearly they aren't the only cause. Here's more details: Today's unemployment figures also show there has been limited progress in fighting youth unemployment in the eurozone over the last year. Eurostat reports that youth unemployment decreased by 415 000 in the European Union since April 2013, and by 202 000 in the euro area. That leaves 5.259 million young persons (under 25) unemployed in the EU28, of whom 3.381 million were in the euro area. That means the youth unemployment rate was 22.5% in the EU28 (down from 23.5% in April 2013) and 23.5% in the euro area (down from 23.9% a year ago). The lowest rates were observed in Germany (7.9%), Austria (9.5%) and the Netherlands (11.0%), and the highest in Greece (56.9% in February 2014), Spain (53.5%) and Croatia (49.0% in the first quarter of 2014). This chart shows how the eurozone unemployment rate dipped from 11.8% to 11.7% in April, while the wider measures across the European Union fell to 10.4% from 10.5%. There's slightly better news on the unemployment front -- the eurozone jobless rate has fallen to 11.7% in April, from 11.8% in March. But that headline figure hides massive variations across the euro area. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.9%), Germany (5.2%) and Luxembourg (6.1%). The highest was recorded in Greece (26.5% in February 2014) and Spain (25.1%). Jurgen Baetz of AP reckons the ECB must act: Analyst Lorcan Roche Kelly flags up that core inflation, stripping out volatile measures, also fell by more than expected in May. BREAKING: Inflation across the eurozone has slumped to just 0.5% in May, from 0.7% in April. That's a bigger fall than some economists expected, and makes it more likely that the European Central Bank will act on Thursday. The euro is flickering around the $1.3595 mark against the US dollar as traders brace themselves for the flood of data.... (corrected!) Just a few minutes until we get eurozone harmonised inflation for May, and the official unemployment rate for April, at 10am BST exactly... Just in -- growth in Britain's construction sector fell to its slowest level in seven months in May, as builders experience bottlenecks and supply shortages. But at 60.0, the UK construction PMI still showed solid growth (50 is the cut-off point between expansion and contraction). Markit, which compiled the data, said that house building remains the strongest performing area of the sector, while commercial work grew at its weakest rate for seven months. Economist Tim Moore said: Residential building remains a key engine of growth, with survey respondents citing another surge in new house building starts during May. The strong growth over the last year has left builders scrabbling to get their hands on materials such as bricks. The latest survey pointed to another steep increase in demand for construction materials, with input buying rising at the fastest pace for three months. Moreover, supplier lead times lengthened markedly in May, with survey respondents widely noting shortages of stock and supply-chain bottlenecks. But despite those supply problems, firms took on more staff for the twelfth successive month in May. Back on Spain's jobless data... and our correspondent Stephen Burgen flags up that 200,000 more people have started paying social security, which is the best figures since 2005. That's on top of the 112,000 drop in unemployment. Just 30 minutes until we get the overall eurozone inflation and jobless data (see preview here) City firm Clear Treasury predicts that the eurozone inflation rate has fallen further away from the ECB's target of just below 2%: Today, much anticipated flash inflation figure from Europe expect to see a drop to 0.6% in May from ).7% in April, a long way from ECB\u2019s target inflation rate of 2%. This would be the eighth consecutive month it has been below 1%. Unemployment data due today also from Europe is expected to remain unchanged from April\u2019s figure of 11.8%, near record highs of 12% seen in 2013. Another worrying point in the Italian jobless data -- the employment rate (the ratio of 15-64 year olds in the labour market) fell to 55.4%, from 55.6% in March. Just In: Italy's young people continue to bear the brunt of its economic woes. The Italian youth unemployment rate has hit a new record high of 43.3% in April, up from March's 42.9%. That's the highest level since the current records began in 1977. The broader unemployment rate came in at 12.6% for April. That's unchanged from March - which has been revised down from the initial reading of 12.7%. Over in Greece, there have been scuffles as finance ministry cleaning staff who lost their jobs last summer held a protest. They are urging the Greek government abide by a court ruling last month that they should be reinstated. Here's some photos and video from the scene, via Twitter user Joanna P. The French government is rallying behind BNP Paribas, its largest bank, as US authorities threaten it with a $10bn fine for breaking sanctions. France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, told France 2 television that such a penalty would not be fair. Fabius said: \"If there is a an error or a violation then it's normal that there is a fine, but the fine has to be proportionate and reasonable. These figures are not reasonable\". Asked if the government is prepared to defend BNPP, Fabius replied \"\"Yes, of course, of course.\", Reuters reports. Fabius comments come amid reports that Francois Hollande's government has reached out to the US authorities over the issue. The far-right National Front, fresh from success in the European Parliamentary elections, had raised the pressure by claiming Hollande wasn't protecting BNP from American \"racketeering\". US authorities accuse BNP Paribas of processing wire transfers related to Sudan, Iran, Syria without triggering warning alarms. A $10bn fine would be the biggest ever imposed on a bank for this kind of wrongdoing. BNP has yet to issue a plea over the charges. The first piece of eurozone unemployment data is out...and the number of people registered as out of work in Spain fell by 111,916 people last month -- the biggest fall for a May on record. That's a drop of almost 2.4%, and takes the total number of people out of work to 4.57%. It's the fourth monthly drop in a row. Spanish unemployment usually falls in May as the tourism season picks up. But in seasonally adjusted terms, the jobless total still fell, by 24,604 people. Engracia Hidalgo, secretary of state for employment, says the figures show an incipient economic recovery is underway. Hidalgo added that the fall in unemployment and improving hiring figures are part of a \"sustained trend\". According to Spain's Labour Ministry, registered unemployment has decreased by 318,543 people over the last 12 months. The recovery may be taking hold.... Europe's stock markets have opened calmly, with the FTSE 100 dropping 8 points to 6855 in the opening exchanges. The French and Italian indexes also dipped by 0.1%, while the German DAX and Spanish IBEX are flat as traders nervously wait for the inflation and unemployment data at 10am. Overnight, HSBC economists have called for Beijing to deploy new stimulus measures after its survey of China's manufacturing sector showed a small contraction. HSBC's monthly PMI survey rose to a four-month high of 49.4, up from 48.1 in April, but still below the 50-point mark. Qu Hongbin, HSBC\u2019s chief China economist, says: The final PMI reading for May confirmed that the economy is stabilizing, but it is too early to say that it has bottomed out, particularly in light of a weaker property sector. Stronger policy support is warranted. In the City, Foxtons\u2019 chief executive Michael Brown has stepped down just nine months after leading the aggressive London estate agent chain\u2019s flotation. He's resigned for \"personal reasons\" after 12 years at the agent and seven years in charge. Reminder: this latest rise in UK house prices comes hours after the European Commission urges Britain to rein in its property boom, in its annual recommendations to EU members. IHS analyst Howard Archer reckons UK house prices will now increase by another 5 to 6% over the rest of 2014, and another 7% in 2015 -- which would be a slowdown. The average price of a home in the UK has hit a record high in cash terms. Building society Nationwide has reported that price rose for the 13th consecutive month in May, meaning the average UK home now costs \u00a3186,512 As my colleague Hilary Osborne reports: This is the first time that the index has returned to its peak since the crisis, and news that annual price inflation is now running at 11.1%, its highest level since June 2007, could fuel further calls for policymakers to step in to cool the market. But at 0.7%, the monthly rate of inflation reported by Nationwide was lower than the 1.2% recorded in April. More here: UK average house price hits all-time high, according to Nationwide Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It's examination season in Europe right now, with students cramming up and being quizzed about how well they grasp key subjects. And European policymakers and politicians get their own test results today, when the latest eurozone unemployment and inflation data is announced. And I fear dunce's caps will be in demand more than gold stars at 10am BST when the figures are released. Eurozone inflation is expected to have fallen back from last month's meagre rate of 0.7%, perhaps as low as 0.5%. That would surely heighten calls for the European Central Bank to ease monetary policy and announce new stimulus measures on Thursday. Especially as Germany's inflation rate slipped to a four-year low yesterday -- this is now longer just a \"peripheral\" problem. And Europe's jobless rate is expected to remain close to last month's 11.8%, and there are fears that Italy could be dragged up to a new record high. If so, that will underline that the pace of recovery in the eurozone remains too slow to repair its battered labour market. Stan Shamu of IG reports that the financial markets are nervously awaiting the data: The recent moves in European equities have been choppy at best, with some nervous trading heading into the ECB meeting. Investors will continue to focus on a disappointing inflation picture after German CPI disappointed and ECB member Nowotny suggested higher inflation is necessary to prevent a Japanese model deflation. Everything is pointing towards ECB action on Thursday but the scope and form is keeping investors guessing. Lets not rule out some surprise good news though.... But in the meantime, the euro is hovering close to a three and a half-month low against the US dollar, around $1.36. We'll also be watching events in Greece, where rumours swirl of a government reshuffle -- while in the UK, we have the latest Nationwide house prices which show prices rose by another 0.7% last month. Oh, and overnight, the Indian and Australian central banks have both left their interest rates unchanged -- at 8% and 2.5% respectively. We'll be tracking all the key events through the day.",

      "bodyText": "In Piedmont they have been making gianduiotto, a confectionery combining hazelnuts and cocoa sold in a pretty tinfoil wrapper, since the mid-18th century. They realised long ago that the nuts, which are plentiful in the surrounding hills, are a perfect match for chocolate. But no one had any idea that their union would prove so harmonious, lasting and fruitful. Only after the second world war was this historic marriage finally sealed. Cocoa beans are harder to come by and, consequently, more expensive. Pietro Ferrero, an Alba-based pastry cook, decided to turn the problem upside down. Chocolate should not be allowed to dictate its terms. By using more nuts and less cocoa, one could obtain a product that was just as good and not as costly. What is more, it would be spread. Nutella, one of the world's best-known brands, celebrated its 50th anniversary in Alba last month. In telling the story of this chocolate spread, it's difficult to avoid cliches: a success story emblematic of Italy's postwar recovery, the tale of a visionary entrepreneur and his perseverance, a business model driven by a single product. The early years were spectacular. In 1946 the Ferrero brothers produced and sold 300kg of their speciality; nine months later output had reached 10 tonnes. Pietro stayed at home making the spread. Giovanni went to market across Italy in his little Fiat. In 1948 Ferrero, now a limited company, moved into a 5,000 sq metre factory equipped to produce 50 tonnes of gianduiotto a month. By 1949 the process was nearing perfection, with the launch of the \"supercrema\" version, which was smoother and stuck more to the bread than the knife. It was also the year Pietro died. He did not live long enough to savour his triumph. His son Michele was driven by the same obsession with greater spreadability. Under his leadership Ferrero became an empire. But it would take another 15 years of hard work and endless experiments before finally, in 1964, Nutella was born. The firm now sells 365,000 tonnes of Nutella a year worldwide, the biggest consumers being the Germans, French, Italians and Americans. The anniversary was, of course, the occasion for a big promotional operation. At a gathering in Rome last month, attended by two government ministers, journalists received a 1kg jar marked with the date and a commemorative Italian postage stamp. It is an ideal opportunity for Ferrero \u2013 which also owns the Tic Tac, Ferrero Rocher, Kinder and Estath\u00e9 brands, among others \u2013 to affirm its values and rehearse its well-established narrative. There are no recent pictures of the patriarch Michele, who divides his time between Belgium and Monaco. According to Forbes magazine he was worth $9.5bn in 2009, making him the richest person in Italy. He avoids the media and making public appearances, even eschewing the boards of leading Italian firms. His son Giovanni, who has managed the company on his own after the early death of his brother Pietro in 2011, only agreed to a short interview on Italy's main public TV channel. He abides by the same rule as his father: \"Only on two occasions should the papers mention one's name \u2013 birth and death.\" In contrast, Ferrero executives have plenty to say about both products and the company, with its 30,000-strong workforce at 14 locations, its \u20ac8bn ($10bn) revenue, 72% share of the chocolate-spreads market, 5 million friends on Facebook, 40m Google references, its hazelnut plantations in both hemispheres securing it a round-the-year supply of fresh ingredients and, of course, its knowhow. \"The recipe for Nutella is not a secret like Coca-Cola,\" says marketing manager Laurent Cremona. \"Everyone can find out the ingredients. We simply know how to combine them better than other people.\" Be that as it may, the factory in Alba is as closely guarded as Fort Knox and visits are not allowed. \"It's not a company, it's an oasis of happiness,\" says Francesco Paolo Fulci, a former ambassador and president of the Ferrero foundation. \"In 70 years, we haven't had a single day of industrial action.\" It has to be said that life in Alba (population 31,300) would be less rosy without Ferrero, though it is also famous for its white truffles. The average wage is higher there than elsewhere in Italy, according to Cremona. The company takes charge of minding workers' children, sport and cultural activities, and health insurance for life for anyone who has worked in the firm for 30 years. Alba residents can also heat their homes, at a competitive rate, by connecting to the company's power plant. In 2011, 30,000 people attended the funeral of Pietro Ferrero, including much of the country's political and business establishment. \"A funeral reminiscent of the one for [the famous cyclist] Fausto Coppi and much more than just a ceremony to mark the passing of a job creator,\" La Stampa wrote in a special edition of the daily. The virtues of family capitalism also feature largely in corporate communication. At a time when many Italian brands have been taken over by foreign companies or been forced to raise funds on the stock market, Ferrero is attached to its original model. When, in November 2009, it was reported that Ferrero was considering its options regarding the possible purchase of Cadbury, it was dismissed as blasphemy \u2013 as if a dead fly had been found in a Mon Cheri chocolate. \"Our identity is based on our independence,\" Fulci explains. \"If we had shareholders they would ask us to increase turnover. But it takes time to make a good product.\" As well as cocoa and hazelnuts. This story appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde",

Laurent Fabius told France 2 television: \"If there is an error or violation then it's normal that there is a fine, but the fine has to be proportionate and reasonable. These figures are not reasonable.\" US authorities are investigating whether BNP Paribas flouted American sanctions against Sudan, Iran and Syria between 2002 and 2009. Sources have said a settlement could include a fine of more than $10bn, although a final judgment has not been made. The remarks come just two days before France's president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, sits down to dinner with Barack Obama, who is visiting France to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the D-day landings. The French government is pulling out all the stops to defend BNP Paribas, a bank deemed 'too big to fail' and that received a \u20ac5.1bn (\u00a34.1bn) bailout at the height of the financial crisis. Hollande has raised concerns about a BNP Paribas plea deal with the White House, while French officials have also contacted the US state and treasury departments, according to sources quoted in the New York Times. According to the paper, the French are concerned that a guilty plea would force the bank to suspend part of its business operations in New York. As well as a fine, BNP Paribas faces a temporary suspension of its authority to clear US dollar transactions. A $10bn fine would be more than five times the amount of the largest penalty so far levied by US authorities against banks: HSBC paid $1.97bn in 2012 for offences including alleged money laundering for Mexican drug cartels, and admitted it had helped clients evade US sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Libya. Standard Chartered, the next biggest offender, paid $667m, mainly for breaking sanctions against Iran.",

Gusbourne was founded 10 years ago when Andrew Weeber, the company's chairman, decided to convert arable land in Kent into a vineyard producing sparkling wine. Weeber, a South African consultant orthopaedic surgeon, studied in Cape Winelands District before moving to Britain to practise medicine. He returned to the wine business when he bought a plot of land on south-facing slopes at Appledore in Kent and began planting the champagne grapes chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier. The move was partly a bet that climate change would create ideal growing conditions for sparkling wine in south-east of England. Last year's hot summer produced ideal conditions that have added to Gusbourne's wine stocks, Weeber said. Ashcroft's takeover added his Sussex vineyards to Weeber's existing land and gave Gusbourne a presence in the two main counties producing English wine. The billionaire businessman tweets about Gusbourne along with details of the opinion polls he commissions. Gusbourne, which is listed on London's Aim market, posted a \u00a3666,000 pre-tax loss for the year to the end of March. Weeber, who owns 13% of Gusbourne, said the loss was planned and reflected the long-term costs of building an upmarket wine producer. \"The production of premium quality wine from new vineyards is, by its very nature, a long term project. It takes four years to bring a vineyard into full production and a further four years to transform these grapes into an exquisite sparkling wine. \"As pretenders to the champagne crown our products have to be at least as good and, with exacting standards and favourable climatic conditions, perhaps even better.\" He said the company would raise extra funds by selling shares to invest in new vineyards and wine stocks and to spend on marketing its brand.",
