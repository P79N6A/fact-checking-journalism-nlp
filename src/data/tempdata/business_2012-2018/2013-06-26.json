      "bodyText": "Bad news: the economic turkey that is HS2 has just become more expensive. Forget \u00a332.8bn, the working assumption until Wednesday for the cost of building the high-speed railway. The new price tag is \u00a342.6bn, the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, told the Commons. Yes, the new number includes \"contingencies\", but so did the old number. Most of the extra costs derive from route changes, extra tunnels and the need to link HS2 to HS1, the line to the channel tunnel. That's the way of things with big infrastructure projects, of course. The cost usually goes up. It happened with the west coast mainline and the Olympics. By now, though, the government and the Labour party should be asking the hard question: since no project can be allowed a limitless budget, at what point would they deem HS2 to be too expensive? They should start by studying last month's excellent report by the National Audit Office, which pointed out two uncomfortable truths. First, the economic benefits from HS2 have fallen radically during the planning process. Back in 2010, it was envisaged that every \u00a31 spent on the first stage of the line between London and Birmingham would yield \u00a32.60 of benefits. Since then the figure has fallen to \u00a31.40 \u2013 and that was using the old projected costs. Second, heroic assumptions have been made in calculating the supposed economic benefits. For example, the colossal sum of \u00a312.6bn is meant to arise from carrying business travellers at faster speeds. But the Department for Transport appears to have assumed that business folk do no work on trains, which is clearly nonsense in the age of Wi-Fi. As the NAO put it, the department's methodology \"uses a simplifying assumption that time spent travelling is unproductive\". The government should go back to the drawing board. There may be an urgent need to increase rail capacity but HS2 is highly unlikely to be the most sensible solution. The economic case, already marginal, gets worse with every new set of numbers. It is time to consider smaller projects with quicker and more certain benefits.",

      "body": "<p>Bad news: the economic turkey that is HS2 has just become more expensive. Forget \u00a332.8bn, the working assumption until Wednesday for the cost of building the high-speed railway. The new price tag is \u00a342.6bn, the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, told the Commons.</p> <p>Yes, the new number includes \"contingencies\", but so did the old number. Most of the extra costs derive from route changes, extra tunnels and the need to link HS2 to HS1, the line to the channel tunnel.</p> <p>That's the way of things with big infrastructure projects, of course. The cost usually goes up. It happened with the west coast mainline and the Olympics.</p> <p>By now, though, the government and the Labour party should be asking the hard question: since no project can be allowed a limitless budget, at what point would they deem HS2 to be too expensive?</p> <p>They should start by studying last month's excellent report by the National Audit Office, which pointed out two uncomfortable truths.</p> <p>First, the economic benefits from HS2 have fallen radically during the planning process. Back in 2010, it was envisaged that every \u00a31 spent on the first stage of the line between London and Birmingham would yield \u00a32.60 of benefits. Since then the figure has fallen to \u00a31.40 \u2013 and that was using the old projected costs.</p> <p>Second, heroic assumptions have been made in calculating the supposed economic benefits. For example, the colossal sum of \u00a312.6bn is meant to arise from carrying business travellers at faster speeds. But the Department for Transport appears to have assumed that business folk do no work on trains, which is clearly nonsense in the age of Wi-Fi.</p> <p>As the NAO put it, the department's methodology \"uses a simplifying assumption that time spent travelling is unproductive\".</p> <p>The government should go back to the drawing board. There may be an urgent need to increase rail capacity but HS2 is highly unlikely to be the most sensible solution. The economic case, already marginal, gets worse with every new set of numbers. It is time to consider smaller projects with quicker and more certain benefits.</p>",

It has asserted their importance as a \"backstop\" measure of an institution's financial health, which is entirely proper since the ratio of equity to overall assets is an excellent starting point for a regulator. But the Bank has not spelled out when UK firms should meet or exceed the 3% ratio. The issue flared last week when the Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) revealed that Barclays and Nationwide, alone among the big boys, are below 3%. Get the ratios up, was the message. But by when? The PRA didn't say and the FPC offered no clues today. Andrew Bailey declined to talk deadlines and said instead that firms must submit \"sensible, consistent and achievable\" plans. Hold on, though, a sensible plan to raise capital to meet a December 2013 deadline could look very different from a plan to meet a December 2015 deadline \u2013 or, indeed, a 2018 deadline, which is the less than ambitious international target. Bailey further confused matters by making the throwaway remark that \"it comes back to my answer about lobbying\". What did he mean? Was he suggesting that Nationwide and Barclays have rushed round to Downing Street to complain about the Bank's new emphasis on leverage ratios? Well, no, when pressed, he didn't confirm that. It's very odd. The common sense approach here is surely simple: set a public deadline for the leverage target to be met by all banks, but add that individual waivers will be considered when there is a pragmatic argument for doing so.

The nation's gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of all goods and services produced in the economy, grew at a 1.8% annual rate from January through March. The figure was revised down from 2.4% as consumer spending and business investment were revised sharply downward. The economy has grown for 15 consecutive quarters, but the pace of those gains \u2013 about 2% \u2013 is among the weakest for recoveries since the second world war. In the fourth quarter of 2012, economic output expanded by only 0.4%. Personal consumption expenditures \u2013 the key measure of consumer spending \u2013 was revised down to 2.6% from 3.4%. Spending on foreign travel, legal services, personal care and healthcare, especially dental and home healthcare, were weaker than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said. The Commerce Department revised growth in private investment to 7.4% in the first quarter, down from an original estimate of 12.3%. This was the third revision to the first quarter's GDP figures. Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, said it was unusual for the third estimate to deviate so dramatically from the second estimate. \"Clearly growth in the first quarter was much weaker than previously thought,\" he wrote in a note to investors. \"Another area of meaningful weakness is imports; imports were originally reported as growing by 5.4% but now show a contraction of 0.4%. There is one area of positivity though; residential investment expanded at a more rapid pace that originally thought. So housing continues to be an important boost to growth when several other categories are weighing on the economy.\" The deepest recession since the Great Depression officially ended in June 2009. But growth has averaged about 2% annually, among the weakest for recoveries since the second world war. Last week the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, triggered a global sell-off on the stock markets when he gave the clearest indication yet that he intends to cut back on the Fed's $85bn-a-month stimulus programme. The sell-off came even as Bernanke cautioned that while there were clear signs of recovery in the economy, he would not cut back the so-called quantitative easing programme if they worsened. One factor holding back the economy, according to Bernanke, is tightening fiscal policy. The Fed said last week that massive government spending cuts \u2013 known as sequestration \u2013 now being implemented are \"restraining economic growth\" and are expected to take their toll on the second quarter's GDP. Spending cuts are expected to be $85bn this year and grow to $109bn in 2014, according to a recent report from Goldman Sachs. Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic research firm, is predicting a 1.4% growth rate for the second quarter.

    "webTitle": "Bank of England calls for assessment of interest rate rises on borrowers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A significant numbers of households might have to cut spending or work longer hours to keep up their debt repayments if interest rates rise suddenly. The warning from the Bank of England came as it called for an urgent assessment of the impact from a sharp rate increase after four years of low borrowing costs. The Bank also used its financial stability report to give banks permission to release \u00a370bn of easy-to-sell instruments, such as government bonds, which they have been forced to hold in case there is a re-run of the 2007 credit crunch. Paul Tucker, outgoing deputy governor for financial stability, said it would be \"foolhardly\" to predict how much of the \u00a370bn of liquidity being released might feed through into lending. But, he said, the relaxation of the rules would \"strike the appropriate balance between achieving resilience and reducing possible impediments to the supply of credit to the economy\". The report made six recommendations intended to avert another banking crisis including calling on the Treasury to examine whether banks are ready for a cyber attack and make banks reassess the way they measure risks. The first recommendation in the report, used by the new financial policy committee (FPC) to spot the next big risks to the financial system, focused on the impact of rising interest rates. Financial markets have already been spooked by concerns that the Federal Reserve might start to reduce the $85bn (\u00a355bn) a month stimulus being pumped into the US economy with traders pointing to faster than usual rises in government bond yields. \"The violence of the adjustment over the past fortnight underlines the search for yield over the past months and the need for the authorities \u2026 to pin down whether or not there are any vulnerable links in the financial system that could jeopardise stability,\" Tucker said. The current market movements were an amber light warning for stability, he added. The Bank's governor, Sir Mervyn King, said on Tuesday that financial markets had \"jumped the gun\" on expecting a rise in global rates, though the Bank said that banks could be affected by rate rises as they price 40% of their assets on market values, which are falling. \"A significant cohort of UK borrowers could experience financial difficulties if interest rates were to rise during a period of subdued income growth,\" the Bank said. It cited a survey showing that households with the equivalent of 9% of mortgage debt, who replied to the survey, would have to take action, such as reducing spending or working longer hours, if rates were to rise by just one percentage point, from 0.5% currently, without an increase in their income. This would rise to 20% if interest rates were to rise by two percentage points. The report pointed out that for the bulk of the six months since the Bank's last assessment of financial stability the markets had been stable and bank balance sheets had strengthened. But more recently volatility has increased because of concerns that interest rates could rise. This triggered the call by the Bank for regulators to report back to the FPC by September about the vulnerability of borrowers and financial institutions to \"sharp upward movements in long-term interest rates and credit spreads\". The report said that financial stability was still \"clouded by risks from a weak and uneven global recovery, and imbalances in the euro area\". \"In the near term the risks could crystallise if global long-term interest rates were to rise abruptly from current still historically low levels, or credit spreads were to widen. Further out, risks could accumulate if a search for yield intensifies and assets become progressively mispriced,\" the report said. Another recommendation requires banks to make an assessment of how much capital they need by using a standardised approach to measure risks, and not just their own models, which could force banks to hold more capital as well. The FPC, which has faced criticism for requiring banks to find \u00a327bn of more capital at a time when lending is weak, insisted that more capital was \"crucial to building financial resilience\". Lobbying attacked Andrew Bailey, the City regulator, has criticised banks for lobbying to water down regulations and called for new \"ground rules\" on discussions. which could force them to raise more capital The head of the Prudential Regulation Authority said attempts by banks to change regulations had intensified in the last 20 years. \"[Lobbying] makes it all the more hard to achieve a stable institutional structure for regulation,\" said Bailey, echoing remarks made by outgoing governor Sir Mervyn King, who has also criticised attempts by banks to water down rules. King told MPs that Downing Street and the Treasury had been lobbied by banks to water down new rules on capital levels. Bailey also frustrated the banking industry by refusing to saywhether he expects Barclays and Nationwide to achieve their leverage ratio \u2013 a new closely watched measure of financial health \u2013 before the internationally agreed deadline of the start of 2019. Both institutions could need to raise billions of pounds of extra capital if the deadline is being accelerated.",

Financial markets have already been spooked by concerns that the Federal Reserve might start to reduce the $85bn (\u00a355bn) a month stimulus being pumped into the US economy with traders pointing to faster than usual rises in government bond yields.</p> <p>\"The violence of the adjustment over the past fortnight underlines the search for yield over the past months and the need for the authorities&#xa0;\u2026 to pin down whether or not there are any vulnerable links in the financial system that could jeopardise stability,\" Tucker said. The current market movements were an amber light warning for stability, he added.</p> <p>The Bank's governor, Sir Mervyn King, said on Tuesday that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/25/mervyn-king\" title=\"\">financial markets had \"jumped the gun\"</a> on expecting a rise in global rates, though the Bank said that banks could be affected by rate rises as they price 40% of their assets on market values, which are falling.</p> <p>\"A significant cohort of UK borrowers could experience financial difficulties if interest rates were to rise during a period of subdued income growth,\" the Bank said. It cited a survey showing that households with the equivalent of 9% of mortgage debt, who replied to the survey, would have to take action, such as reducing spending or working longer hours, if rates were to rise by just one percentage point, from 0.5% currently, without an increase in their income. This would rise to 20% if interest rates were to rise by two percentage points.</p> <p>The report pointed out that for the bulk of the six months since the Bank's last assessment of financial stability the markets had been stable and bank balance sheets had strengthened. But more recently volatility has increased because of concerns that interest rates could rise. This triggered the call by the Bank for regulators to report back to the FPC by September about the vulnerability of borrowers and financial institutions to \"sharp upward movements in long-term interest rates and credit spreads\".</p> <p>The report said that financial stability was still \"clouded by risks from a weak and uneven global recovery, and imbalances in the euro area\".</p> <p>\"In the near term the risks could crystallise if global long-term interest rates were to rise abruptly from current still historically low levels, or credit spreads were to widen. Further out, risks could accumulate if a search for yield intensifies and assets become progressively mispriced,\" the report said.</p> <p>Another recommendation requires banks to make an assessment of how much capital they need by using a standardised approach to measure risks, and not just their own models, which could force banks to hold more capital as well.</p> <p>The FPC, which has faced criticism for requiring banks to find \u00a327bn of more capital at a time when lending is weak, insisted that more capital was \"crucial to building financial resilience\".</p> <h2><strong>Lobbying attacked</strong></h2> <p>Andrew Bailey, the City regulator, has criticised banks for lobbying to water down regulations and called for new \"ground rules\" on discussions. which could force them to raise more capital</p> <p>The head of the Prudential Regulation Authority said attempts by banks to change regulations had intensified in the last 20 years.</p> <p>\"[Lobbying] makes it all the more hard to achieve a stable institutional structure for regulation,\" said Bailey, echoing remarks made by outgoing governor Sir Mervyn King, who has also criticised attempts by banks to water down rules. King told MPs that Downing Street and the Treasury had been lobbied by banks to water down new rules on capital levels.</p> <p>Bailey also frustrated the banking industry by refusing to saywhether he expects Barclays and Nationwide to achieve their leverage ratio \u2013 a new closely watched measure of financial health \u2013 before the internationally agreed deadline of the start of 2019. Both institutions could need to raise billions of pounds of extra capital if the deadline is being accelerated.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fallout from the Anglo Irish Bank tapes with executives singing \"Deutschland \u00fcber Alles\" while joking about German money rescuing the financial institution has provoked disgust in the country, a senior ally of chancellor Angela Merkel has said. Michael Fuchs, deputy leader of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party in the Bundestag, described the recordings as \"unbearable\". In a series of phone calls senior bankers at the toxic, debt-ridden bank laugh about German largesse on the night the Irish government rescued Anglo Irish Bank from collapse with large injections of cash from European partners including Germany. The outrage in Germany is deeply embarrassing for the current Fine Gael-Labour coalition in Dublin as the government seeks to reduce the Republic's debt burden to the EU, the European Central Bank and the IMF. Fuchs told RTE radio on Wednesday: \"We are offended. If you have a feeding hand you shouldn't bite into it.\" He added \"it's really dangerous\" language as German politicians are trying to convince local taxpayers to support European countries, such as Ireland. \"It's absolutely unbearable that somebody is talking like this.\" In one conversation \u2013 taped just two days after 30 September 2008 bank guarantee \u2013 Anglo Irish Bank's disgraced former CEO David Drumm giggles while his colleague John Bowe recites lines from \"Deutschland \u00fcber alles\". Bowe accepted in a statement that the language used in the taped recordings of internal bank conversations \"was imprudent and inappropriate\". The behaviour of the Anglo Irish executives has turned them into national hate figures in the Republic and now, it appears, also in the country which has supplied most of Europe's money to prop up not only the Irish banking system but also the entire state. As Anglo Irish Bank moved towards the fiscal abyss, Drumm is heard joking, \"another day, another billion\", referring to the flight of deposits out of the doomed bank before the bank guarantee in September 2008. At the time the outflow was running at over \u20ac1bn (\u00a3847m) a day. Meanwhile Irish prime minister Enda Kenny has said he may have to seek a referendum asking the Irish people for greater government powers to investigate the banking crash that almost bankrupted Ireland. Speaking in the Dail the taoiseach said he was considering a second referendum that would grant the state more power to hold searching inquiries. The tapes appear to confirm that Anglo Irish bankers hoodwinked the then Fianna F\u00e1il-led government back in 2008 with a vastly underestimated price for the bank rescue. John Bowe, then the bank's director of capital markets, is heard on the tapes explaining where got the figure of \u20ac7bn needed to save Anglo Irish from oblivion.

At that time, before and just after Italy entered the euro, Rome was flattering its accounts by taking upfront payments from banks in order to meet the deficit targets set by the EU for joining the first wave of 11 countries that adopted the euro in 1999.</p> </blockquote> <p>The FT also suggests that the estimated loss of \u20ac8bn is \"surprisingly high\" given these contracts have a notional value of \u20ac31.7bn. <em>Did Italy get a particularly rough deal off the banks?...</em></p> <p>The claims are another headache for prime minister <strong>Enrico Letta</strong> as he battles to stimulate Italy's economy and keep his fragile coalition together. The timing's not great, either, with Italy's borrowing costs rising in recent days and a big bond sale tomorrow.</p> <p>They could also put <strong>Mario Draghi</strong> in warm water, as he was running the Italian Treasury in the late 1990s when the contracts were originally taken out.</p> <p><strong>And the elefante in the room is the way Italy, like Greece, used complex methods improve its finances in the years before joining the single currency.</strong> Those derivative contracts would have bolstered the county's balance sheet when they were taken out, but would have added to its liabilities in future years as they were repaid.</p> <p>As this graph (<em>hat-tip to the FT again</em>) shows, Italy give its finances quite a polish in the late 1990s, bringing its deficit down from over 6% in 1996 to below 3% in 1997, qualifying for euro membership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a5b4b3db-ce94-421d-a9c6-dd4ddbbb3f32\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/26/1372229018994/a9c7e4b4-f04c-4e13-b32a-7a53c98f7c01-460x369.png\" alt=\"Italy's economy around euro entry\" width=\"460\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Financial Times</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here's the FT's story: <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/440007a8-dd9a-11e2-a756-00144feab7de.html#axzz2X79jPpKm\">Italy faces restructured derivatives hit</a></p> <p><strong>I'll pull some reaction to the claims shortly, along with a round-up of other events coming up today.....</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-26T07:06:03.333Z\">at 8.06am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And on that note, I'm wrapping up for the day. Back tomorrow to mop up the reaction to tonight's meeting of EU finance ministers (apologies, Mr Noonan, but I forgot my sleeping bag). We'll also have the EU summit to excite us. The Italian derivatives contracts row (see 7.58am onwards too) could well develop tomorrow too. Until then, thanks, and goodnight. GW. The US Treasury just held a less than impressive bond auction, with demand falling and investors demanding higher rates of return. It sold $35bn-worth of five-year debt at yields up to 1.484%, which is the highest interest rate on these bonds since July 2011. And the Treasury only received bids for 2.45 times as much debt as it sold. That's the lowest bid-to-cover ratio (the measure of demand) since September 2009. Not a disaster, but perhaps a sign that traders are losing their appetite for US Treasuries? Especially now that the Federal Reserve may be tightening its own belt..... Tonight's bank bail-in talks are the prelude to the EU summit - and there is speculation tonight that there could be a breakthrough on the EU budget (or multi-annual financial framework). The FT's Peter Spiegel tweets: Over in Brussels, European finance ministers face a long evening as they try to agree rules for how failing banks in the region would be rescued. And crucially how the bill is split up. This session was called after ministers failed to make any progress. Michael Noonan, the Irish fin min who will chair tonight's meeting, has already predicted one of those classic European late night nailbiters. On Monday, he told reporters: It\u2019ll be slow -- bring your sleeping bag. Sweden's Anders Borg has already warned that there's no certainty of a deal tonight, as AP's Jurgen Baetz reports from Brussels: At issue, the question of how bond-holders, large depositers, shareholders share the bill when a banks fail, rather than taxpayers being tapped. Bloomberg sums it up here. Talks last week foundered on the question of which creditors face writedowns when banks fail. Some countries demanded more flexibility for national authorities, while others sought strict rules across all 27 EU nations. Ministers considered several ways to set thresholds for losses that would need to be assigned via strict formulas before national discretion would be allowed. An updated plan, circulated by Ireland to nations today, would hand regulators different degrees of flexibility depending on how they plug gaps that arise when some creditors are exempted from writedowns. Europe's stock markets closed higher today, and government bond also strengthened again, as investors fretted a little less about the end of loose monetary policy. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 63 points at 6165, +1.04% \u2022 German DAX: up 129 points at 7940, +1.66% \u2022 French CAC: up 76 points at 3726, +2.1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 215 points at 7823, +2.8% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 306 points at 15362, +2% Some traders are calculating that today's downward revision to US GDP (see 1.48pm) means the Federal Reserve will take a more cautious approach to slowing its quantitative easing programme. The Dow is also higher today, up 102 points. However, the strengthening dollar suggests that other investors are also preparing for a tapering of the Fed's bond-buying programme. A confusing picture. In the bond markets, sovereign debt is stronger across the board, which has pushed down borrowing costs. It has also narrowed the spread between peripheral countries and Germany \u2013 another sign the markets are less edgy. Here's a round-up of the yields on 10-year bonds tonight. \u2022 UK: 2.45%, down 7 basis points (or 0.07%) \u2022 US: 2.53%, down 2bp \u2022 Germany: 1.76, down 3bp \u2022 Spain: 4.8%, down 24bp \u2022 Italy: 4.71%, down 16bp \u2022 Greece: 11.1%, down 33bp In the currency markets, the euro has fallen back below $1.30 as the US dollar strengthens. Back to the issue of Italy's derivative contracts (sorry for slow posting, I've been assisting with our spending review coverage too but I don't think we've missed anything). Enrico Cucchiani, the chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's biggest retail bank, has conceded that a potential financial hit of \u20ac8bn isn't good news for the country, even if it was all legal and above board. Cucchiani explained: Eight billion is not a huge amount in relative terms and I don't think it will move the dial either way. (But) it's not good news. One might recall the famous line from Forrest Gump - 'life is just like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get'. In other developments -- Reuters flags up that the Rome prosecutors said they had opened a file on the case. That was triggered by the financial police seeking documentation on the contracts, something that was confirmed by the Italian Treasury today. Cyprus has received the latest slice of its bailout, worth another \u20ac1bn, from the European Stability Mechanism. Details here. That takes the total received by Nicosia so far from the ESM to \u20ac3bn, with a total of \u20ac9bn assigned. It also appears that EU leaders will not give any official consideration to Cyprus's appeals for its bailout to be adjusted when they hold a summit on Thursday and Friday. Crumbs. The US economy grew rather less strongly than we thought in the first quarter of the year, according to the latest estimate of GDP. Instead of expanding by 2.4% on an annualised basis (or +0.6% quarter-on-quarter), America's GDP only rose by 1.8% (+0.45% q/q). Weaker consumer spending is the cause, with the personal consumption section of the data slashed. Reaction to follow Nice piece from economist Shaun Richards on the Italian derivative's issue: An Italian tale of debt,deficits and derivatives is unfolding. It flags up that Italy has already paid more than \u20ac2.5bn to JP Morgan to settle an earlier derivatives contract (details here). And Shaun, like other commentators, points to Mario Draghi's involvement (as head of the Italian Treasury between 1991 and 2001) Here's a flavour: It will not help sentiment that [after 2001] Draghi then moved to the Vampire Squid itself, Goldman Sachs, which no doubt will one day be discovered to be involved in the derivative contracts. We do know that Goldman Sachs was involved with derivatives contracts in Greece which attempted (successfully at the time) to hide her true fiscal position at Euro entry although Mr Draghi denies he had anything to do with them. Unfortunately for Mr Draghi the issue of hidden derivatives contracts has come up before. Regular readers will recall the case of Monte dei Paschi di Siena or MPS which was discovered to have taken out some disastrous derivatives contracts leading to a bailout being required from the Italian state. At that time Mario Draghi was the Governor of the Bank of Italy and was accordingly responsible for its supervision. Europe's stock markets have risen this morning, clawing back some of the recent losses. Spain and Italy are showing the biggest rises. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 62 points at 6164, +1% \u2022 German DAX: up 117 points at 7928, +1.5% \u2022 French CAC: up 66 points at 3716, +1.8% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 188 points at 7796, +2.5% \u2022 FTSE MIB: up 326 points at 15382, +2.1% Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, was upbeat, but cautious: Something odd appears to be happening this morning. The FTSE 100 is enjoying its second \u2018up\u2019 day in a row, building on yesterday\u2019s move that lifted it away from the 6000 level. It still feels as if markets are simply looking to catch their breath after all the excitement of the past week, and so it is perhaps unwise to suggest that two days of positive trading make a trend. Government bonds are also strengthening. The yield on Spain's 10-year bond dropped below the 5% mark, to 4.9%. Italy's 10-year bond has dropped to 4.75%, from 4.87% yesterday. The European Commission isn't changing its view on Italy's debt position on the back of today's information. Spokesman Simon O'Connor told the midday briefing in Brussels: According to the available information, the figures do not change our assessment of the past deficits in Italy or indeed the appreciation of future deficits. Just 25 minutes until the UK chancellor, George Osborne, delivers the spending review to parliament, outlining details of billions of pounds of job cuts. Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging it here: Osborne announces spending review 2013: Politics live blog The Italian finance ministry has published its official response to the Financial Times's claims today (details below). In it, the ministry explains that these contracts were taken out to protect Italy against a repeat of the financial crises of the early 1990s. They protected against market risks including \"foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk\". Like any insurance, however, if the event to which you protect yourself from happening, you carry a cost, although it remains justified by the priority given to the prevention of serious consequences in the event of adverse scenarios. The ministry is also adamant that the transactions met national and European accounting principles. \"Checks carried out systematically by Eurostat from the second half of the 1990s\" have found that they were acceptable, it added. The full statement is online here (in Italian). The Italian Treasury also insisted that claims it used derivative contracts to massage its figures before euro entry were \"completely baseless\". (see opening post for details of how its deficit fell in the run-up to euro entry) The Italian Treasury has just issued a statement, denying wrongdoing over its derivative contracts and insisting that the country's finances are not at risk. However it doesn't appear to reject the claim that it is facing hefty losses on the contracts, saying that 'hedging' against potential losses comes at a price. Here's the Reuters newsflashes 10:50 - ITALY TREASURY SAYS NO DANGER TO STATE FINANCES FOLLOWING REPORTS OF DERIVATIVES LOSSES 10:53 - RPT-ITALY TREASURY DENIES DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS USED TO MEET CRITERIA TO ENTER EURO 10:57 - ITALY TREASURY SAYS HEDGING INSURANCE ALWAYS CARRIES A COST, WHICH IS JUSTIFIED BY NEED TO PROTECT AGAINST SERIOUS RISKS 10:58 - ITALY TREASURY SAYS DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS AT TIME OF ENTRY TO EURO WERE ALWAYS CORRECTLY REGISTERED 10:58 - ITALY TREASURY SAYS DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS WERE SUBJECT TO SYSTEMATIC CHECKS BY EUROSTAT, ALWAYS CONFIRMED TO BE IN CONFORMITY WITH RULES Looking for the statement now Mario Draghi has said the Italian Treasury will respond to claims that it faces an estimated \u20ac8bn loss on derivative contracts (see 7.58am onwards). Here's the Reuters newsflash: \u2022 RTRS - ECB DRAGHI SAYS ITALIAN TREASURY PLANNING STATEMENT ON REPORT OF LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES And Sony Kapoor of the Redefine thinktank tweets that the ECB president is starting to look a little tarnished by recent events: The Bank is also holding a webcast: Here's a link to the full Bank of England Financial Stability Report. The Bank of England has warned banks and borrowers of the risks of a sharp rise in interest rates, in its new Financial Stability Report. The report, just released, also warns that the eurozone is still a threat to the UK economy. My colleague Jill Treanor reports that the BoE has urged regulators to assess the impact of sharp rises in interest rates, after four years of historically low lending rates. Even though the Bank's outgoing governor Sir Mervyn King said on Tuesday that financial markets had \"jumped the gun\" on expecting global rates were about to rise, the Bank used its twice annual survey of financial risks to call on banks to assess the impact of rate rises on their customers. Making six recommendations in all, the Bank also calls for the Treasury to work with regulators to improve and test resilience of the financial system to a cyber attack. It also calls for banks to provide more information in their 2013 annual reports about their capital and accounting methodologies. The report shows that the Bank is concerned about recent volatility, after several calm months. Here's the key quotes from the Report: The outlook for financial stability is still clouded by risks from a weak and uneven global recovery, and imbalances in the euro area. In the near term the risks could crystallise if global long-term interest rates were rise abruptly from current still historically low levels, or credit spreads were to widen. Further out, risks could accumulate if a search for yield intensifies and assets become progressively mispriced. More to follow. Gold and silver prices have fallen to their lowest levels in over two and a half years, as precious metals continue to be clattered by the rising dollar. The spot price of an ounce of gold has fallen another $33, to $1,233, a level not seen since September 2010. Silver has dropped over 4%, to $18.56 an ounce, from $19.58 last night. That's the lowest since August 2010. Both commodities have been major casualties as the Federal Reserve inched towards slowing its stimulus package. The dollar is up against other major currencies again today (pushing the pound down half a cent to $1.536, and the euro down 0.4 cents to $1.304). Lee McDarby of Investec Corporate Treasury explained: Overnight the dollar has strengthened to push gold prices to almost a three year low with the greenback being well bought against both the Euro and Sterling, despite this morning\u2019s better than expected German Consumer Confidence number. ECB president Mario Draghi has urged eurozone leaders to reform their economies to create sustainable economic growth, in a clear 'hurry-up' before this next week's EU summit. Speaking in Paris, Draghi declared: The ECB has done as much as it can to stabilise markets and support the economy. Now governments and parliaments need to do all they can to raise growth potential. It's a repeat of that familiar refrain that monetary policy can't solve everything (Sir Mervyn King of the Bank of England made the same point to MPs yesterday). As Draghi put it: If growth is stalling because the economy is not producing enough or because firms have lost competitiveness, this is beyond the power of the central bank to fix. As well as plugging his OMT bond-buying programme again, Draghi pointed out that young people suffer the most when No mention of those dodgy Italian derivatives, though. Here's some early reaction: Avner Azulay, the head of the Marc Rich Foundation, has confirmed that Rich has died (see 9.04am), telling Reuters: Marc Rich passed away this morning at his home in Lucerne. He will be brought to Israel for burial. A few interesting pieces of eurozone economic data to flag up, which collectively offer some reasons for optimism. 1) German consumer confidence has hit its highest level since September 2007. The GfK measure of consumer sentiment jumped to 6.8, from 6.5 last month, due to \"a robust labour market and wage increases\". Could this lead to increased spending, and higher imports from other euro members? 2) The Bank of Spain has reported that most economic indicators suggest its economy is improving. In its monthly report, it said: The most recent information, for the second quarter, points to an improvement in most indicators referring to demand and activity and a slow down in the contraction. 3) Updated French GDP data confirmed that its economy shrank by 0.2% in the first three months of 2013. At last things aren't getting worse. The BBC's Robert Peston is also excited by the news of Italy's exposure to derivative losses (see 7.58am onwards): Some breaking news -- Marc Rich, the legendary commodities trader and one-time fugitive from justice, is reported to have died today aged 78 (via Swiss Radio 1) And what a life he had. From shaping the commodities market (creating the forerunners of both Glencore and Trafigura, he's also credited with inventing the spot oil market) to becoming one of America's most wanted men, facing charges of illegal trading with Iran and tax evasion. He fled the US to avoid federal indictment, before controversially being pardoned by Bill Clinton on the president's final day in office in 2001. As we wrote back in 2001, in the Curious case of Marc Rich's pardon: Mr Rich's 18-year battle with the US authorities became public knowledge in October 1982, when the existence of a grand jury investigation into his tax affairs was leaked. The allegation was that he was involved in a \"classic criminal fraud\" - a view the justice department still holds. By summer 1983 the net was closing in and Mr Rich fled to Switzerland. In September, the grand jury handed down a 51-count indictment against him and his main business partner, Pincus Green, of wire fraud, racketeering, trading with the enemy during the 1980 Iranian hostage crisis, and tax evasion. It charged them with violating federal controls on oil prices through a complex daisy chain of transactions. Profits from a $100m income were moved off-shore, evading $48m in taxes. If convicted on all counts, Mr Rich faced up to 300 years in prison. It has been suggested that he also supplied weapons and spare parts to the Iranian regime of Ayatollah Khomeini. Hours before his pardon, an FBI criminal background check was sent to the White House indicating that he was involved in \"arms dealing\". This detailed Observer profile is also well worth a look: The rich list He cornered the market in mercury, aluminium and silver. He bust sanctions to sell oil to the world's most notorious states. He was one of the FBI's most wanted men. But was winning a controversial pardon Marc Rich's smartest coup? Also coming up today.... Greece's new cabinet will be getting down to work, with its Troika of lenders due back in Athens in the coming days. In the UK, the Bank of England will release its financial stability report at 10.30am, and George Osborne announces the much-anticipated Spending Review at 12.30pm (which my colleague Andrew Sparrow will be covering in detail in Politics Live). We get revised US GDP data this afternoon too, and the latest personal consumption stats (1.30pm BST / 8.30am EDT). And tonight, EU finance ministers will gather in Brussels for another crack at agreeing rules to handle failing banks, having failed to agree a deal last week. It could be a long, long meeting..... Economist Frederik Ducrozet points out that Italy (and Greece) weren't alone in finding innovative ways to make their finances look better. Even France was at it: (details here in the New York Times, circa 1996) The news that Italy could lose \u20ac8bn on these derivative contracts has caused something of a stir in the City. Mike Van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, comments: Lots of coverage of Italy facing multi-billion euro hits from derivatives contracts - used to help gain accession to single currency \u2013 which have gone sour after being restructured at height of crisis. Robin Bew, chief economist of the Economist Intelligence Unit, blames Italy's political leaders for the mess, while Italian journalists Gianni Riotta reckons the claims will fuel anti-euro sentiment: And several commenters are pointing the finger at Mario Draghi, the current president of the European Central Bank, who was running the Italian Treasury when these contracts were originally taken out. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone, the financial markets and the world economy. Italy is reportedly facing losses of around \u20ac8bn on controversial derivative contracts taken out in the late 1990s, and restructured at the height of the eurozone crisis. Confidential government papers seen by the Financial Times suggest the Italian Treasury is sitting on an \u20ac8bn loss after restructuring eight debt contracts with foreign banks in early 2012, at what appear to be poor terms. The FT explains that the 29-page report is fascinating both for what it shows, and what it doesn't: While the report leaves out crucial details and appears intended not to give a full picture of Italy\u2019s potential losses, experts who examined it told the Financial Times the restructuring allowed the cash-strapped Treasury to stagger payments owed to foreign banks over a longer period but, in some cases, at more disadvantageous terms for Italy. The report does not name the banks or give details of the original contracts \u2013 questions that worried the state auditors \u2013 but the experts said they appeared to date back to the period in the late 1990s. At that time, before and just after Italy entered the euro, Rome was flattering its accounts by taking upfront payments from banks in order to meet the deficit targets set by the EU for joining the first wave of 11 countries that adopted the euro in 1999. The FT also suggests that the estimated loss of \u20ac8bn is \"surprisingly high\" given these contracts have a notional value of \u20ac31.7bn. Did Italy get a particularly rough deal off the banks?... The claims are another headache for prime minister Enrico Letta as he battles to stimulate Italy's economy and keep his fragile coalition together. The timing's not great, either, with Italy's borrowing costs rising in recent days and a big bond sale tomorrow. They could also put Mario Draghi in warm water, as he was running the Italian Treasury in the late 1990s when the contracts were originally taken out. And the elefante in the room is the way Italy, like Greece, used complex methods improve its finances in the years before joining the single currency. Those derivative contracts would have bolstered the county's balance sheet when they were taken out, but would have added to its liabilities in future years as they were repaid. As this graph (hat-tip to the FT again) shows, Italy give its finances quite a polish in the late 1990s, bringing its deficit down from over 6% in 1996 to below 3% in 1997, qualifying for euro membership. Here's the FT's story: Italy faces restructured derivatives hit I'll pull some reaction to the claims shortly, along with a round-up of other events coming up today.....",

    "webTitle": "Paul Soros obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sometimes described as \"the invisible Soros\", Paul Soros, who has died aged 87, was the older brother of the financier George, and a multimillionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist in his own right. An engineer, he devised profitable methods of shipping huge bulk cargoes in places too shallow for conventional docks. He claimed that the inspiration for a key component \u2013 the use of buoys \u2013 came from the floating pontoons on the Danube in his native Hungary. In 1951, and living in the US, Soros joined the export department of Hewitt-Robins, a manufacturer of material-handling equipment, and he travelled extensively. He noticed that, compared with other major constructions, the capital cost of bulk port terminals used for shipping commodities, such as coal or iron-ore, varied widely. Soros concluded that the reason was a conflict between the skills of material handling and marine engineers. During a trip to Chile, he met some Hungarians developing an iron-ore mine who had complained they could not afford the $4m expense of an offloading facility. They had joked to Soros: \"Come back to us if you figure out a way to do it for $1m.\" He worked out a system whereby the capital cost of a pier could be saved by tying a ship to buoys and moving it in front of a fixed conveyor. The miners were interested, and Soros started his business from the playroom in his house. Soros Associates is estimated to have been responsible for the design and engineering of ports and offshore terminals for bulk raw materials in more than 90 countries, extending the technology to permit loading in open seas and off shallow coasts, techniques particularly helpful for developing countries. Soros was born in Budapest to a well-to-do Jewish family and was a successful junior tennis player and skier before the war. His father, Tivadar Schwartz, was a lawyer and intellectual who had been imprisoned in a Siberian labour camp at the end of the first world war and became a committed internationalist, editing an Esperanto magazine. As anti-Jewish agitation grew, he changed the family name to Soros \u2013 which means \"will soar\" in Esperanto. He was a powerful influence on his children, warning against the dangers of totalitarianism. Paul recalled: \"We grew up with a definite value system that had a strong sense of 'noblesse oblige' \u2026 you had a responsibility towards your fellow humans.\" When Hitler invaded in 1944, Tivadar dispersed the family under assumed Christian names in Budapest while he provided forged papers to would-be refugees, with high prices for the wealthy subsidising the poorer. Although the family survived, Paul was arrested by the incoming Russians and marched with thousands of others out of the city. But just before they reached open country, he made a lone run for it after failing to persuade others to make a mass break-out. He hid in a burnt-out farmhouse, escaping a desultory search. Back in Budapest, while George was sent to school in England, Paul enrolled at a technical university to study mechanical engineering and continue his sporting enthusiasms, becoming a regular member of the Hungarian National Ski Team. After the 1947 Communist takeover, using the Winter Olympics as cover, he escaped in 1948 to Switzerland where, with his father's help, he secured a student visa for the US. Arriving in New York when he was 22, Paul Soros wrote to colleges with ski teams, seeking a scholarship. He chose St Lawrence University in upstate New York. But a freak accident when a buried slalom pole speared him, causing the loss of a kidney, ended his skiing days, so he enrolled at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn to study mechanical engineering. While there, he met his wife, Daisy Schlenger, another Hungarian refugee. They married in 1951. Soros never forgot his time as a student, and after his business was sold in 1989 to a subsidiary of ENI, the state-owned Italian company, he began spending more time on his philanthropic interests, including the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. Established with $50m, it provides graduate school fellowships to immigrants to the United States. Among his many activities, he was also a trustee of his old institute, now the Polytechnic Institute of New York University: \"It gives the sons of janitors who possess a work ethic the chance to move into the middle class. That's a very necessary and worthy institution. That's why I am involved.\" His personal life was touched by tragedy. Two of his children died in infancy \u2013 his eldest son in a playground accident, and a daughter run over in his drive. He is survived by Daisy and two sons, Peter and Jeffrey. Soros did not flaunt his wealth and said of himself: \"I drifted into something I enjoyed doing and I was fortunate to have the opportunity to do it. My story is riches to rags to riches again. I was lucky to survive. The rest was relatively easy.\" \u2022 Paul Soros, engineer, entrepreneur and philanthropist, born 5 June 1926; died 15 June 2013",

His responses are characterised by a barely concealed contempt for the parliamentarians and he has certainly never demonstrated the degree of contrition they have been pushing for. The financial crisis was, variously, the fault of the banks, regulators, politicians and an entire global financial system addicted to debt.

King said the first goal, where Maradona blatantly batted the ball into the net with his hand, was a clear example of breaking the rules to achieve an objective. A central bank could similarly exploit low inflation expectations to boost growth temporarily, but could not get away with it repeatedly, he said. The second goal saw Maradona dribble half the length of the pitch before scoring, proceeding largely in a straight line while defenders anticipated a move to either side.

His annual inflation report has traditionally been a chance for him to share his greatest fears for the economy with the rest of us, predicting doom and gloom for years to come.
