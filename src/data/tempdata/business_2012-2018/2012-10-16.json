      "bodyText": "TNK-BP has lost a high court case to prevent a former employee disclosing documents relating to alleged corruption on the eve of a deadline that could decide the ownership of the Russian business. Mr Justice Morritt, the chancellor of the high court in London, dismissed an attempt by TNK-BP to extend a gagging order obtained in July against its former head of logistics. Igor Lazurenko left the company in April and TNK-BP started a probe into his alleged fraud which culminated in it seeking to recover allegedly corrupt receipts. The logistics boss struck back, claiming to have documents that showed alleged wrongdoing by senior executives at TNK-BP involving those at state-owned businesses and agencies. It was this claim that triggered the legal action, although neither BP nor Lazurenko's lawyers wanted to comment after the case. The blocking of an extended gagging order came just before the midnight Wednesday deadline under which BP was confined to holding talks on the sale of its half-share of TNK-BP with its existing Russian partners. The Alfa Access Renova (AAR) consortium, led by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman, has said it wants to buy out the 50% holding it does not own in TNK-BP, but has also said it would be willing to sell its holding. Rosneft, the largely state-owned Russian group, has already expressed interest in purchasing the BP stake, a $20bn cash-and-share-swap proposal that is said by its chief executive Igor Sechin to have the agreement of the Kremlin. Under the terms of the shareholder agreement between BP and AAR, the two sides have been forced to negotiate exclusively for a 90-day period in good faith since BP formally put its stake up for sale in June. That deadline expires on Wednesday night and while nothing has prevented AAR or Rosneft from putting in formal offers, BP has been constrained from tying up a definite deal with anyone other than AAR, with whom it has had historically difficult relations. BP has also run into trouble in another former Soviet republic, with the speaker of the national parliament in Azerbaijan saying the UK company is on its final \"warning\" over oil production failures. Asadov Oktay has added his voice to those criticising BP for failing to meet expected levels of production from its Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field in the Caspian Sea. \"BP will fulfil its commitments on oil production in Azerbaijan because it was warned for the last time,\" speaker of the country's national assembly said on Tuesday, according to the private APA news service. Its president, Ilham Aliyev, said last week that BP had made \"grave mistakes\" which resulted in an \"unexpected decline\" at the country's largest complex of oilfields. Output fell by 12% in the first half of 2012 compared with the same period last year, but on Monday Azerbaijan's industry and energy minister, Natiq Aliyev, said BP faces \"no threat\" in the country and its operating licence was safe. A BP spokesman said: \"We know there is a problem and want to sort it out.\"",

Speculation is mounting that RBS may sell its Citizens arm in the US after Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Services Authority's bank supervision arm, wrote to the bank's boss Stephen Hester, pointing out that a sale of the business \u2013 and a further scaling back of the investment bank \u2013 would help its capital position. The bank, 81% owned by the taxpayer, will be leaving the so-called asset protection scheme (APS) with the approval of the FSA. The move will be seen as a major reduction in government support for the bank, which still has \u00a345bn of taxpayers' money locked up in its shares. The Treasury will take a \u00a35bn profit from the APS, which was created in 2009 as a crucial backstop for \u00a3282bn of bad loans and investments made by RBS in the runup to the banking crisis. Hester has been signalling for months that the bank wanted to leave the scheme as soon as it had paid the minimum fee to the taxpayer of \u00a32.5bn. That total will have been paid by Thursday and means the taxpayer will make a \u00a35bn profit on the scheme as Lloyds Banking Group was charged \u00a32.5bn when it decided not to formally sign up for the APS in November 2009. Taking into account the fee paid by RBS, the government may be able to argue that the average price at which shares were bought in the bank \u2013 500p \u2013 can be reduced, although it will still be well above the 280p at which they closed on Tuesday night.

But that has had a negative impact on car retailers and manufacturers in the UK, he said. \"It means that margins are very thin for vehicle manufacturers and their retail networks.

      "bodyText": "The government's independent fiscal watchdog admitted on Tuesday it had been caught unawares by the slowdown in the economy over the past two years, blaming higher than expected inflation and weak exports for getting forecasts wrong. Robert Chote, director of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said his organisation had predicted growth six times stronger between 2010 and 2012 than latest official figures suggest was the case. In the OBR annual forecast evaluation report the organisation says it failed to anticipate the rapid cooling of activity in 2011 because the sharp increase in the cost of living had bitten deep into the spending power of households. The study says the inability to forecast the double-dip recession from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the second quarter of 2012 had been due to poor trading performance as the UK felt the backwash from the eurozone crisis. Fresh OBR forecasts will be produced at the time of George Osborne's autumn statement early December, but the OBR said that so far the chancellor's austerity measures had reduced GDP by less than the organisation had anticipated in its first set of forecasts in mid-2010. It acknowledges, however, that it may also have erred in calculations of the growth damage caused by spending cuts and tax increases. \"Along with many forecasters we significantly overestimated economic growth in the past two years. This likely reflected several factors, including the impact of stubborn inflation on real consumer spending, deteriorating export markets on net trade, impaired credit conditions, euro area anxiety and demand uncertainty on business investment. Fiscal consolidation may also have done more to slow growth than we assumed.\" In a forecast shortly after the coalition formed, the OBR said gross domestic product \u2013 a measure of national output \u2013 would rise by 5.7% from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2012. The actual increase was 0.9%. \"Following the coalition's first budget in June 2010 we forecast that the recovery would be slower than its predecessors, but nowhere near as slow as it has been,\" the OBR says. The watchdog estimates the impact of tax and spending changes with the use of multipliers; these show how output will be lost for a 1% tightening of policy. It says the plans introduced by Osborne and his Labour predecessor, Alistair Darling, might have been expected to have reduced the level of GDP in 2011-12 relative to what it would have been had policy remained unchanged. While noting that the multipliers used would have needed to be more than twice as large to explain the unexpected growth shortfall, the OBR says: \"Estimates of the multipliers vary widely, so it is clearly possible that the fiscal consolidation exerted more of a drag on growth than we assumed.\" The latest figures show that national output is 4.1% below its previous peak at the start of 2008.

In 2010, the trophy hotels of its subsidiary Maybourne Hotel Group attracted a rush of interest after it became apparent that the company, and several of its band of Irish property tycoon owners, had become financially overstretched. Among those circling were Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour and the Al-Thani ruling family of Qatar.</p> <p>But in January last year the Barclay brothers bought the stake of one Coroin shareholder and a second pledged to sell his holding to them. However, a third investor, Paddy McKillen, has been fighting a bitter battle against ceding full control to the brothers. He faces a \u00a36m legal bill after a failed attempt to sue the twins.

      "bodyText": "The Barclay brothers, owners of the Telegraph newspaper, have given the luxury hotel group behind Claridge's and the Berkeley a temporary reprieve after the company missed a September deadline to repay borrowings of \u00a3660m \u2013 debt described by a high court judge in August as manifestly \"too high\". Sir Frederick and Sir David bought up Coroin's debts last year and have been seeking to win full control of the business for more than two years. In 2010, the trophy hotels of its subsidiary Maybourne Hotel Group attracted a rush of interest after it became apparent that the company, and several of its band of Irish property tycoon owners, had become financially overstretched. Among those circling were Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour and the Al-Thani ruling family of Qatar. But in January last year the Barclay brothers bought the stake of one Coroin shareholder and a second pledged to sell his holding to them. However, a third investor, Paddy McKillen, has been fighting a bitter battle against ceding full control to the brothers. He faces a \u00a36m legal bill after a failed attempt to sue the twins. Refusing to give up, he is seeking an appeal. As well as controlling much of the equity, in September last year the Barclays used a loan from Barclays bank to acquire Coroin's \u00a3660m debt, which had fallen to Ireland's National Asset Management Agency, its state-owned toxic loan book. These borrowings are now overdue. Coroin's debt problems are so acute that auditors from KPMG have flagged concerns over its prospects as a going concern. Signing off the accounts on 13 September \u2013 with days to go before the \u00a3660m was due for repayment \u2013 senior auditor Laura Gallagher said directors were in urgent refinancing discussions with \"a number of financial institutions\". She added: \"Prior to putting in place alternative facilities additional equity may be required from shareholders.\" McKillen has previously warned he feared the Barclays would attempt to marginalise him by forcing a \"dilutive rights issue\". A spokesman for McKillen, who is a director of the company, insisted on Tuesday there was no need to tap up shareholders for additional funds. \"We are fully confident that long-term refinancing of the entire \u00a3660m will take place shortly.\" The business posted pretax profit of \u00a33.6m on turnover of \u00a3138m for 2011.",

    "webTitle": "UK inflation falls to lowest since November 2009", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK inflation fell to its lowest in almost three years in September, easing the pressure on cash-strapped consumers. But there was a sting in the tail for people on benefits, as last month's inflation numbers will be used to set payouts. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said consumer price inflation eased to 2.2% in September, the lowest since November 2009. That compares with a rate of 2.5% in August and is in line with economists' forecasts. Inflation as measured by the retail prices index (RPI), which includes some housing and tax costs, dropped from 2.9% to 2.6%. Policymakers have been hoping that a fall in inflation will ease the pressure on consumers and encourage people to start spending again to help prop up the economy. However, the figures were skewed by sharp rises in gas and electricity in September last year and inflation is expected to pick up again when this year's round of price increases start to take effect. This month four of the big six energy suppliers announced that bills would rise by 6%-9%. Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics said higher utility bills, rising food prices and university tuition fees would lift inflation in the coming months. But she expected the yearly rate to stay close to the Bank of England's 2% target, and even fall below it as a result of the weakness of the economy. That should pave the way for the bank to announce an extension of the quantitative easing programme later this year. She said: \"While next month's MPC [monetary policy committee] decision is shaping up to be a relatively close call, we still expect more asset purchases to be announced in the coming months.\" Tuesday's data will provide George Osborne with a rare piece of good news, as next year's benefits bill could come in lower than forecast as a result. The Office for Budget Responsibility, whose forecasts are used by the Treasury, expected September's CPI [consumer prices index] to be 2.6%. Under that estimate, the benefit bill for next year stood at \u00a3183bn. The lower rate of inflation will also offer relief to retailers and other companies, as the annual increase in business rates, due in the spring, is determined by September's RPI. However, some of Britain's leading retailers are campaigning for rates to be frozen, as the escalation of costs was preventing them from opening new stores and driving the economy. In a letter to the Financial Times, Ian Cheshire, chief executive of Kingfisher, Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, and Andy Clarke, chief executive of Asda, called for the moratorium. Separately, the ONS said factory gate inflation rose to 2.5% \u2013 higher than analyst forecasts of 2.2% \u2013 while input prices dropped 1.2%, as the price of oil and imported metals came down. The ONS said house prices rose 1.8% on the year in August, down from a 2% increase in July.",

Inflation as measured by the retail prices index (RPI), which includes some housing and tax costs, dropped from 2.9% to 2.6%.</p> <p>Policymakers have been hoping that a fall in inflation will ease the pressure on consumers and encourage people to start spending again to help prop up the economy. However, the figures were skewed by sharp rises in gas and electricity in September last year and inflation is expected to pick up again when this year's round of price increases start to take effect. This month four of the big six energy suppliers announced that bills would rise by 6%-9%.</p> <p>Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics said higher utility bills, rising food prices and university tuition fees would lift inflation in the coming months. But she expected the yearly rate to stay close to the Bank of England's 2% target, and even fall below it as a result of the weakness of the economy. That should pave the way for the bank to announce an extension of the quantitative easing programme later this year.</p> <p>She said: \"While next month's MPC [monetary policy committee] decision is shaping up to be a relatively close call, we still expect more asset purchases to be announced in the coming months.\"</p> <p>Tuesday's data will provide George Osborne with a rare piece of good news, as next year's benefits bill could come in lower than forecast as a result. The Office for Budget Responsibility, whose forecasts are used by the Treasury, expected September's CPI [consumer prices index] to be 2.6%. Under that estimate, the benefit bill for next year stood at \u00a3183bn.</p> <p>The lower rate of inflation will also offer relief to retailers and other companies, as the annual increase in business rates, due in the spring, is determined by September's RPI. However, some of Britain's leading retailers are campaigning for rates to be frozen, as the escalation of costs was preventing them from opening new stores and driving the economy.</p> <p>In a letter to the Financial Times, Ian Cheshire, chief executive of Kingfisher, Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, and Andy Clarke, chief executive of Asda, called for the moratorium.</p> <p>Separately, the ONS said factory gate inflation rose to 2.5% \u2013 higher than analyst forecasts of 2.2% \u2013 while input prices dropped 1.2%, as the price of oil and imported metals came down. The ONS said house prices rose 1.8% on the year in August, down from a 2% increase in July.</p>",
