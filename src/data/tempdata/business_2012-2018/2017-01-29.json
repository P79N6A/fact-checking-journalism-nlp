      "bodyText": "BT has fired the first shot in the battle for Champions League football, saying it is determined to keep a grip on the TV rights to European football\u2019s blue-riband club competition and accusing arch-rival Sky of having too much dominance over pay-TV sports. BT is understood to have \u201cdone the rounds\u201d of potential free-to-air partners, with Sky set to do the same, ahead of first round bids being submitted to the governing body Uefa in March. Champions League sponsors have expressed concerns about the lack of exposure under BT\u2019s \u00a3900m exclusive deal, compared with a pay/free deal with Sky and ITV which provided larger audiences. To date Sky and BT have attempted to play down expectations of a bidding war, despite Uefa predicting the next three-year UK deal could go for as much as 30% more at about \u00a31.2bn. However, John Petter, chief executive of BT Consumer, who led the last bid, has admitted that BT has to hold on to the rights to continue to drive its pay-TV business. Asked by City analysts if he thought BT Sport could thrive without the rights, he indicated that they were an essential part of its offering. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on the future [without the rights], not least because our strong preference is to keep the Champions League,\u201d he said. Despite BT holding the rights for the Champions League, a slug of the Premier League and sports including English Premiership rugby, Petter says Sky still exercises too much dominance of the overall sports rights market. \u201cThere is already a market problem because Sky has more than 70% of pay sports revenues in the marketplace now,\u201d said Petter. \u201cIt\u2019s about the combination of the amount of sports rights they control and the absence of any regulation. If we had a 70% share of the broadband marketplace and the rates of [customers] switching [to rivals] were low and prices high people would say that isn\u2019t a good thing for consumers. That is true of Sky Sports customers and nothing [regulatory] has really happened,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is almost a decade since the financial crisis and barely a day has gone by without banks being in the headlines, invariably for the wrong reasons. Only last week, RBS \u2013 73% owned by the state since its bail out in 2008 \u2013 announced it was taking a \u00a33.1bn hit as a result of a case brought by the US Department of Justice over the way the bank packaged and sold mortgages during the great housing bubble that preceded the crash. RBS is just one of many. Banks have been fingered for, among other things, money-laundering, rigging the money markets, and mis-selling payment protection insurance. The total amount paid out by banks for various malfeasances since the financial crisis stands at \u00a3250bn and rising. Despite being serial offenders, banks have been the big beneficiaries of quantitative easing. The bulk of the money created by the Bank of England found its way into asset markets. Share prices have been rising and City bonuses will be good this year. The even better news for the banks is that they are no longer hated. Far from it. Much of the concern about how the UK will survive outside the EU has centred on the future of the City. For years, the banks have been trying to find a way of getting themselves off the public\u2019s naughty step. Brexit has provided them with an opportunity that has been seized with relish. The City has played the post-referendum game masterfully. Roll the clock back 18 months or so to the time of the 2015 general election and it was a different story. Then, a commonly held view \u2013 at least for those not working in the City \u2013 was that the UK suffered from having a too-dominant financial sector. There was distaste for the way a poorly controlled financial sector had wrecked the economy with their speculative excesses and left others to pick up the bill. The recession that the banks caused and the austerity that resulted created the sense of \u201cthem and us\u201d \u2013 the notion of an unbalanced and unequal Britain \u2013 that led to Brexit. Contrast that mood with today when there are daily bulletins about when and under what circumstances HSBC might move 1,000 jobs out of the City to other European capitals, and constant demands that the government secures passporting rights to allow UK authorised institutions to operate freely across the EU27. A couple of years back, there would have been shouts of \u201cgood riddance\u201d from voters had a bank said it was thinking of shifting staff to Frankfurt or Paris. There would have been queues of people volunteering to drive the bus to Heathrow. Now the idea is seen as a national calamity. Where the focus was on the harm the banks did, now the emphasis is on the loss of highly paid jobs and service-sector exports. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, made the point in his party conference speech last year that the UK\u2019s financial services industry was at the heart of the Brexit negotiations. \u201cOur financial services have been placed under threat as a result of the vote to leave,\u201d he said. To be fair to McDonnell, he went on to say that there should be no return to the \u201ccasino economy\u201d that caused the 2008 crash, but the banks can live with that. McDonnell is never going to be the City\u2019s staunchest ally. But it is a sign of how the banks have won a long PR war that even those who were once their sternest critics are now looking out for their interests. The end of banker bashing is frustrating for those who have been campaigning for a financial transactions tax, an idea first floated by the US economist James Tobin in the early 1970s but which only started to look like a realistic proposition since the crash. An FTT has two aims: it is supposed to reduce the amount of churn in financial markets and hence make them less unstable; and \u2013 because activity is so enormous \u2013 it is designed to raise substantial amounts of money for governments even if the levy leads to a fall in the number of trades. Critics of an FTT \u2013 of whom there are plenty in the financial sector \u2013 say it would only work if every country adopted it and that the banks would simply pass on the cost of the tax to their customers. It would make raising finance harder and more expensive. Even so, a group of 10 EU countries \u2013 including the eurozone\u2019s big four of Germany, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 have been working on plans for an FTT and last week Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for the economy, said he thought an agreement was within reach. A forthcoming paper for the Robin Hood Tax campaign by the former City banker Avinash Persaud says the government could build on an existing financial transaction tax \u2013 stamp duty on share trades \u2013 to create a more broadly-based levy that would raise an additional \u00a35bn a year. For a Treasury still running a hefty budget deficit, that is a tidy sum. Persaud takes issue with those who say that a small tax would raise the cost of capital. He notes that financial institutions charge 2% on average for the deals they do for their customers, a rake off that has not changed in 100 years and which dwarfs the proposed starting rate for an FTT. \u201cAll of the efficiency gains since then, as a result of the new information technologies, globalisation, and other developments, have been captured by those who run the industry and not shared with consumers. This has been one of the single largest contributors to worsening income inequality.\u201d Persaud also says that it is now harder to avoid paying the FTT no matter where it is levied. \u201cThe new transparency on beneficial ownership, along with anti-money laundering rules make it significantly easier for tax authorities to tax transactions by residents in securities which are domiciled anywhere, like derivatives.\u201d In reality, the main arguments against an FTT are political rather than technical, as the banks know well. Their message to the UK government is \u201cbe nice to us or we\u2019ll take chunks of our business elsewhere\u201d. Their message to other EU governments is \u201cyou only benefit from Brexit relocation if you kick the idea of an FTT into the long grass\u201d. The City will continue to thrive after Brexit. It is big enough and flexible enough to cope. Some jobs will migrate abroad but the carefully-orchestrated idea that there will be tumbleweed billowing through Canary Wharf five years from now is risible. Still, you have to admire the banks. It has taken a decade of lobbying but they are as influential as ever. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 January 2017 to correct the name of the Robin Hood Tax campaign",

    "webTitle": "140 JD Sports staff taken to hospital from one warehouse in four years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At least 140 people have been taken to hospital after incidents at JD Sports\u2019s controversial warehouse in Rochdale in the last four years. A freedom of information request obtained by the Guardian shows that ambulances have been dispatched to the site 166 times in the last four years, with 140 of these incidents leading to someone being transported to hospital. The revelation comes after an undercover investigation by Channel 4 News found workers claiming that the warehouse was \u201cworse than a prison\u201d. JD said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed and concerned by the footage\u201d but insisted that it did not believe it was an accurate reflection of its culture. Lynne Brosnan, a local Labour councillor, said she was \u201cnot happy\u201d with the new figures. About 1,500 people, including hundreds of agency staff, work at the site. This means that the equivalent of almost one in 10 workers have gone to hospital in the last four years. The figures show that there were 18 times in 2013 when an ambulance transported someone from the site to hospital and then 52 in 2014, 34 in 2015 and 36 in 2016. The number of ambulances dispatched was 21 in 2013, 60 in 2014, 44 in 2015, and 41 in 2016. Brosnan said: \u201cThis is not what we were promised when Kingsway [the site of the warehouse] started. There is a way of treating employees and it is not like third-class citizens. \u201cMy concern is moving forward and making it a better place to work. It\u2019s about caring for our residents and fighting in their corner.\u201d The figures are similar to the situation at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Ambulances were called there 76 times between January 2013 and December 2014 according to a similar freedom of information request. Brosnan criticised JD\u2019s response to Channel 4\u2019s investigation, saying: \u201cIt is about discussing the issue, it\u2019s not about saying this didn\u2019t happen. This is very serious.\u201d A spokesperson for JD Sports insisted health and safety was a \u201chigh priority\u201d for the company. They said: \u201cHealth and safety is a high priority and JD have invested heavily in, and are proud of, health and safety at the Kingsway facility, evidenced by our four star for occupational health and safety compliance from the British Safety Council. This includes an independent assessment of our policies, training, performance and working practices and was awarded in May 2016. \u201cThe data presented clearly states that, despite the considerable expansion of operations at Kingsway and the considerably increased number of staff engaged, the number of ambulances called has decreased since 2014. \u201cThere are up to 1,500 employees on site daily and the number of incidents where an ambulance is called in a year is, therefore, proportionally very low. It must also be emphasised that not all ambulance call-outs will be related to workplace incidents, and that many may relate to an employee falling ill or something unrelated to the work environment, therefore, call-outs related to incidents at work are only a proportion of the numbers quoted. \u201cWe employ a full-time health and safety manager and currently have 60 first aiders at Kingsway, almost double the recommended number of 32, and all employees have a full health and safety briefing in their half-day induction before entering the workplace. \u201cThey are provided with regular updates and training on health and safety matters. In addition, all line managers have mandatory enhanced health and safety training and some have undertaken the Nebosh qualification. Our health and safety committee monitors all reported accidents and incidents and takes appropriate, preventative action to try to avoid any recurrence.\u201d This article was amended to say the investigation into JD Sports was carried out by Channel 4 News and not Dispatches programme.",

      "body": "<p>At least 140 people have been taken to hospital after incidents at JD Sports\u2019s controversial warehouse in Rochdale in the last four years.</p> <p>A freedom of information request obtained by the Guardian shows that ambulances have been dispatched to the site 166 times in the last four years, with 140 of these incidents leading to someone being transported to hospital.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/jd-sports-warehouse-channel-4-kingsway-rochdale\">The revelation comes after an undercover investigation by Channel 4 News found workers claiming that the warehouse was \u201cworse than a prison\u201d</a>. JD said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed and concerned by the footage\u201d but insisted that it did not believe it was an accurate reflection of its culture.</p> <p>Lynne Brosnan, a local Labour councillor, said she was \u201cnot happy\u201d with the new figures. About 1,500 people, including hundreds of agency staff, work at the site. This means that the equivalent of almost one in 10 workers have gone to hospital in the last four years.</p> <p>The figures show that there were 18 times in 2013 when an ambulance transported someone from the site to hospital and then 52 in 2014, 34 in 2015 and 36 in 2016. The number of ambulances dispatched was 21 in 2013, 60 in 2014, 44 in 2015, and 41 in 2016.</p> <p>Brosnan said: \u201cThis is not what we were promised when Kingsway [the site of the warehouse] started. There is a way of treating employees and it is not like third-class citizens.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy concern is moving forward and making it a better place to work. It\u2019s about caring for our residents and fighting in their corner.\u201d</p> <p>The figures are similar to the situation at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international\">Sports Direct\u2019s</a> warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Ambulances were called there 76 times between January 2013 and December 2014 according to a similar freedom of information request.</p> <p>Brosnan criticised JD\u2019s response to Channel 4\u2019s investigation, saying: \u201cIt is about discussing the issue, it\u2019s not about saying this didn\u2019t happen. This is very serious.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for JD Sports insisted health and safety was a \u201chigh priority\u201d for the company.</p> <p>They said: \u201cHealth and safety is a high priority and JD have invested heavily in, and are proud of, health and safety at the Kingsway facility, evidenced by our four star for occupational health and safety compliance from the British Safety Council. This includes an independent assessment of our policies, training, performance and working practices and was awarded in May 2016. </p> <p>\u201cThe data presented clearly states that, despite the considerable expansion of operations at Kingsway and the considerably increased number of staff engaged, the number of ambulances called has decreased since 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThere are up to 1,500 employees on site daily and the number of incidents where an ambulance is called in a year is, therefore, proportionally very low. It must also be emphasised that not all ambulance call-outs will be related to workplace incidents, and that many may relate to an employee falling ill or something unrelated to the work environment, therefore, call-outs related to incidents at work are only a proportion of the numbers quoted.</p> <p>\u201cWe employ a full-time health and safety manager and currently have 60 first aiders at Kingsway, almost double the recommended number of 32, and all employees have a full health and safety briefing in their half-day induction before entering the workplace. </p> <p>\u201cThey are provided with regular updates and training on health and safety matters. In addition, all line managers have mandatory enhanced health and safety training and some have undertaken the Nebosh qualification. Our health and safety committee monitors all reported accidents and incidents and takes appropriate, preventative action to try to avoid any recurrence.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended to say the investigation into JD Sports was carried out by Channel 4 News and not Dispatches programme.</em><br></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of steelworkers will vote on rescue proposals for the Port Talbot steelworks this week in a definitive moment for the crisis in the industry. Tata Steel has tabled a proposal to save 8,000 job in its UK business, including the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, by investing \u00a31bn into modernising its operations over the next 10 years. However, this investment depends on spinning off the pension fund behind Tata Steel UK into a separate entity and replacing the final salary pension scheme with a less generous defined contribution scheme. The existing scheme \u2013 the British Steel pension scheme (BSPS) \u2013 could enter the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) as part of the arrangement, which would result in a 10% cut to members\u2019 benefits. However, for this to occur Tata Steel must convince the Pensions Regulator that its UK business is on the brink of insolvency and is likely to have to pump hundreds of millions of cash into the scheme. The BSPS has 130,000 members and \u00a315bn of liabilities. It would be by far the biggest pension scheme to be taken on by the PPF. The trade unions Unite, GMB and Community have recommended that workers vote in favour of the proposals, but they could still be rejected given the changes to the pension scheme. If the rescue package is approved then Tata Steel will look to complete a merger of its European operations with ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial conglomerate. Tata Steel declined to comment. The trade unions said they had not made the recommendation lightly, telling workers: \u201cNobody is saying that the proposal on the table is without issues. But as we have said before, what you are voting on is the best outcome that could be achieved through negotiation. It is our collective view, supported by our independent experts, that this is the only credible and viable way to secure the future.\u201d However, John Ralfe, a pension consultant, warned: \u201cThyssenKrupp won\u2019t touch Tata UK or Tata Holland unless the British Steel pension scheme is hived off. The risks of it coming back to bite them are too high. \u201cIt is not clear what the pension trustees have in mind with the plan to hive off the pension scheme without Tata Steel UK going into insolvency. The legal tests for a regulated apportionment arrangement [the process whereby a pension scheme enters the PPF] are deliberately set very high. \u201cThe BSPS will certainly close to new pensions, but the \u00a315bn of historic liabilities are likely to remain the responsibility of Tata Steel UK, which will continue to soldier on, and ThyssenKrupp would then be almost certain to walk away.\u201d The steel jobs have been at risk since last March when Tata Steel announced it was putting its UK business up for sale amid losses of more than \u00a31m a day. The decision sparked a political crisis as the government scrambled to secure the future of the plant. Port Talbot is one of only two sites in Britain that makes steel in blast furnaces.",

The \u00a33.7bn deal, which was unveiled on Friday, will supposedly create the UK\u2019s leading food business in a \u00a3195bn market. The companies claim that will \u201cbring benefits for consumers, independent retailers, caterers, small businesses, suppliers, and colleagues, as well as delivering significant value to shareholders\u201d. From this week, we might start to see if shareholders and regulators agree, as documents are made available and the process of addressing possible competition concerns begins. There may be another process gathering some pace this week, too \u2013 that of a few hedge fund managers desperately trying to justify why they thought it was clever to bet on a fall in Tesco\u2019s shares, just as news of the deal prompted a 10% increase.

He was the senior independent director at Rolls-Royce in 2010 \u2013 and he was on the board from 2005 to 2014 \u2013 which suddenly looks awkward following Lord Justice Leveson\u2019s judgment this month that the company was aware in 2010 of corruption allegations within the company, but decided not to notify the Serious Fraud Office. Then there is Conn\u2019s directorship at BT Group, where last week an accounting scandal in the telco\u2019s Italian arm blew up, prompting the shares to be written down by 20%. Conn sits on BT\u2019s audit committee. All of which must leave shareholders in Centrica facing a nervous few weeks. The firm reports results next month.

Each of these terminals makes about \u00a31,000 profit a week (though no shop can have more than four) and they are so addictive (to bookies and punters) that they have often achieved Ace\u2019s aim and taken a punter for everything.

BT\u2019s share price fell by more than 20% on Tuesday, their biggest ever fall in a single day, after it revealed an accounting scandal in its Italian division had cost \u00a3530m and warned of a slowdown in business from the UK public sector and international corporations. As profit warnings go, it was a monster. BT had already flagged up \u201cinappropriate\u201d management behaviour in its Italian division last October, but had estimated that the impact would be a non-cash writedown of \u00a3145m. Just three months later that has become \u00a3530m in cash, burning a nasty hole in the group\u2019s finances. The warning about public sector and international corporate work could also have long-term consequences for BT. Investors are rattled \u2013 and BT has 700,000 of them, many of them small shareholders. Pension funds and City institutions don\u2019t like surprises, and this profits warning came just three days before BT was scheduled to report its third-quarter results. Gavin Patterson, the chief executive, said shareholders had a right to be angry and that what happened in Italy was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Apart from the Italian business, which accounts for a tiny portion of group profits, BT was in \u201cgood health\u201d, Patterson said, and it was important to keep the scandal in perspective. The sharp fall in the share price suggests that investors don\u2019t entirely share his optimism. The history of accounting scandals shows that companies often take a long time to recover from such blows. Tesco, for example, is still under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and facing a lawsuit from shareholders more than two years after it found a black hole in its accounts. Three former Tesco executives will go on trial in relation to the scandal later this year. But BT will also have to deal with the indirect consequences of the scandal. A huge profit warning like this means shareholders will have less patience with underperformance or high spending elsewhere. The share price drop on Tuesday wiped out all the gains that Patterson had built since he replaced Ian Livingston in September 2013. He has overseen an ambitious strategy, spending billions on the rights to major sporting events and mobile operator EE. Shareholders may stop being be quite so accommodating in allowing Patterson time to build up BT Sport as a contender to Sky. With rights to Europe\u2019s premier football tournament, the Champions League, now up for grabs, the timing is unfortunate. When BT snatched the UK television rights to the Champions League from Sky in 2013, it was a coup that confirmed the company as a major player in sports broadcasting. To see it revert to Sky would be a major setback, but keeping it is likely to be expensive. The Italian scandal also highlights how sprawling BT is as a business. Arguably it is the nearest thing the modern day FTSE 100 has to an industrial conglomerate. The Italian business is a minor part of a telecoms empire that covers infrastructure, mobile phones, television and a wide range of corporate services. Can Patterson and BT really keep on top of all the different divisions and maximise their performance? The prospect of BT spinning off Openreach, which owns the telephone cables that connect Britain, has often been raised by critics. Ofcom, the industry regulator, wants Openreach to invest more in rolling out superfast broadband. BT has had successes under Patterson, but Openreach is not the only legacy issue that hangs over it: it also has a pension deficit of \u00a36.2bn. The boss will glad to see the back of what he has described as a difficult few days. He must now ensure that this is a blip rather than the start of a prolonged period of difficulty for BT. Co-op Bank\u2019s road to recovery leads nowhere While Royal Bank of Scotland was last week grabbing all the attention by taking a \u00a33.1bn knock for its latest run-in with regulators, another bank in the recovery ward was admitting to a few problems. Co-operative Bank \u2013 once owned by the mutual grocer and funeral homes operator Co-operative Group \u2013 put out an announcement on Thursday to say its capital position was going to slump below 10% and that it would fail to meet the individual regulatory plan it had agreed with the Bank of England until 2020. In reality this makes no difference to its savers and borrowers, but it is another illustration of how long it can take to make repairs to a bank that has run into trouble. RBS, for instance, will next month report its ninth consecutive annual loss \u2013 its has already reported losses of more than \u00a350bn since its 2008 bailout \u2013 and is a long way from being able to break free from state ownership. Chancellor Philip Hammond admitted he was stuck with the 73% stake. Co-op Bank almost collapsed in 2013 amid a drugs scandal surrounding its former chairman, Paul Flowers, and a black hole in its accounts that kept getting bigger following an ill-fated tie-up with Britannia building society four years earlier. It nearly dragged down its parent, the Co-op Group, which had to cede control of the bank to a group of hedge funds. Co-op Group must now feel stuck with its diminished 20% stake in a bank that is on a very slow path to returning to profitability: it may just squeak into the black next year. There are no easy solutions for either of these banks. Noises are being made (again) about a break-up of the already shrunken RBS. For Co-op the answer may be a takeover. Taking out a proper challenger to the big four on the high street is not easy to advocate, but in this instance it could be the best and fastest way to rejuvenate a once-proud, ambitious and important high-street lender. Top of the food chain? What exactly does it mean to be the UK\u2019s leading food business? It is a question that Tesco and Booker shareholders should be thinking about carefully now that their companies have agreed to a merger. Tesco boss Dave Lewis and Charles Wilson, chief executive of wholesaler Booker, were both, unsurprisingly, enthusiastic about the deal when it was announced, and both companies\u2019 share prices duly rocketed \u2013 although this also had much to do with Tesco saying it would start to pay dividends again. But aside from opportunities to cut costs \u2013 and bringing together some of the brightest minds in retailing \u2013 it is difficult to see how Booker makes Tesco a better retailer and how Tesco makes Booker a better wholesaler. Given that Tesco is the UK\u2019s largest retailer and Booker owns convenience store brands Premier, Budgens and Londis, the Competition and Markets Authority will almost certainly have a look at the deal. But that won\u2019t be the only hurdle this surprising merger has to cross.",
