      "bodyText": "A crash in Australia\u2019s \u201cunprecedented\u201d housing market could lead to a broader economic downturn, according to a report from the OECD. In its first major review of the Australian economy since 2014, the OECD warned the housing market was showing \u201chints of a slowdown\u201d, in what it identified as an \u201cextreme vulnerability\u201d for the economy. \u201cA large drop-off in house prices could cut household consumption and increase mortgage defaults \u2026 The market may not ease gently but develop into a rout on prices and demand with significant macroeconomic implications,\u201d they said. \u201cA continued rise of the market, fuelled by both investor and owner-occupier demand, may end in a significant downward correction that spreads to the rest of the economy.\u201d Australia\u2019s house prices have increased by 250% in real terms since the mid 1990s, with the median house price in Sydney hitting almost $1m at the end of January. The OECD attributed this boom to domestic buyers rather than foreign investment, and recommended government policy should pressure banks to limit mortgage lending for investment properties, and avoid risky loans \u2013 echoing 2014 measures already put in place by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Household debt also rose to record levels, with the debt to disposable income ratio rising to 186.9% at the end of September last year. However, the report noted household debt was \u201cconcentrated in high income households\u201d, and was balanced by rising asset values and low interest rates. A global plunge in iron and coal prices was also identified as another major vulnerability, and the OECD noted the economy still faced \u201cchallenges\u201d in the gender pay gap and in greenhouse gas emissions. It recommended an emissions trading scheme be adopted if carbon reduction targets \u201cbeyond those brought about by the Direct Action Plan\u201d were needed. \u201cThe price of carbon emissions in Australia is low, with large shares of emissions in industry, electricity, agriculture and fisheries are not priced at all. This weakens the incentives to cut carbon in a cost-effective manner,\u201d the report said.",

      "bodyText": "Snap\u2019s arrival on the New York stock exchange is ludicrous in two ways. The first doesn\u2019t matter terribly. If investors want to place a value of $29bn on a five-year-old company that made losses last year of $514m, that\u2019s their lookout. The second is serious. Snap was offering only shares with zero voting rights, which sets an appalling governance example. Technology and social media pioneers already had a shocking record of ignoring the principle that equal economic risk should imply equal voting power. It was poor practice when Google and Facebook floated with shares carrying restricted voting rights, but at least the new co-owners were not entirely frozen out of debates about how the company should be run. Snap\u2019s zero-voting variety offers no possibility that founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy can be held to account should they over-reach themselves in challenging Facebook. Michael Pachter, investment analyst at WedBush, put it well: the governance framework says, in effect, that \u201cyou are a genius and no one should question you\u201d. Snap\u2019s thin justification is that nothing must distract from the single-minded pursuit of the vision of \u201creinventing the camera ... to improve the way people live and communicate\u201d. Whatever that means, it should not involve a governance structure that belongs in the 19th century and would surely be cold-shouldered if attempted in the UK. Yes, US investment bankers will sell most things if the fee is large enough, but the willingness to trample on shareholders\u2019 rights to this degree is breathtaking. So is Snap\u2019s boast that its products \u201cempower people to express themselves\u201d. Its new class of shares does the opposite. Another pre-pack firesale Into administration one minute; out the next. Yes, it\u2019s another pre-pack administration in which the lid is never lifted long enough for outsiders to see what lies within. Mike Ashley is the new owner of lingerie chain Agent Provocateur, paying \u00a330m for the privilege. He is not the first to succeed in one of these speedy sales, but were pre-pack administrations really meant to be a standard technique for selling businesses that have failed to find buyers as a going concern? In other cases, suppliers and landlords have felt short-changed in the rush. An official accounting body ought to have a look. The retail sector, in particular, seems to have adopted pre-packs with an enthusiasm that was never intended. Decapitation at Capita Capita\u2019s Andy Parker cannot be surprised that new chairman Sir Ian Powell has decided to push him out \u2013 or, in the corporate lingo, mutually agree that \u201cthe next phase of his career\u201d is best pursued elsewhere. The share price, down 60% in little more than 12 months, has been a calamity for investors. If you are paid splendidly (Parker got \u00a32.7m in 2015) and you produce the first two profit warnings in a company\u2019s 25-year history, you cannot grumble when the executioner calls. Parker, to his credit, did not \u2013 he is staying until Powell has found a new boss. Yet this deCapitation feels like a borderline case. It\u2019s not as if the company has fallen apart as spectacularly as, say, rival Serco did a couple of years ago. Thursday\u2019s full-year numbers were ruined by the inevitable raft of impairment charges and restructuring costs but, if you\u2019re happy to look at \u201cunderlying\u201d figures, the scars were less deep. Pre-tax profits fell 19% to \u00a3475m but profit margins were 11.1%, which most of Capita\u2019s rivals would love to imitate. The fall in the share price has been steep partly because Capita is carrying too much debt \u2013 \u00a31.8bn at the last count. But the stack is far from ruinous. It should be a simple matter to flog the asset services division, which makes \u00a360m of operating profit, for \u00a3650m-ish and thereby avoid a rights issue. If all goes to plan, the dividend should be safe since it costs \u00a3200m and Capita generated \u00a3400m of cash even in a bad year. Life could yet get worse, but the numbers do not suggest a financial basket case \u2013 far from it. Powell, freshly out of PricewaterhouseCoopers, is clearly an accountant who wants to make his mark. He is entitled to recruit a chief executive from outside since some of Capita\u2019s woes in 2016 \u2013 overspending on the London congestion charge and failure to spot the rot in the recruitment business \u2013 were self-inflicted. But it is not a risk-free decision. Capita, love it or loathe it, has always prided itself on promoting from within. Soon it could have a chairman and chief executive with combined service of less than a year. Powell, two months into his first gig chairing a big public company, has made a big call that wasn\u2019t driven by shareholder pressure \u2013 it had better be correct.",

    "webTitle": "Brexit without trade deal would open Pandora's box, says CBI chief", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Plunging out of the European Union in two years without a new trade deal would open up a Pandora\u2019s box for Britain\u2019s businesses, Paul Drechsler, the president of CBI, has warned. As Theresa May prepares to trigger the formal talks process for leaving the EU, Drechsler used a speech at Mansion House in the City of London on Thursday night to warn that the two-year article 50 process would be a \u201croller-coaster\u201d for businesses trying to plan for the future. The prime minister has said that at the end of the two-year process, no deal would be better than a bad deal, and the Brexit secretary, David Davis, has warned his cabinet colleagues to draw up contingency plans in case Britain has to exit without a deal and is forced to trade with the rest of the EU on less preferential World Trade Organisation terms. But Drechsler said the consequences for some companies would be so dire it was impossible for them to prepare. \u201cHere in the UK and across the continent firms are worried about this \u2018worst-case scenario\u2019. Some are getting ready for it to reduce economic damage. Some won\u2019t prepare because they\u2019re hoping for a deal. But in reality many firms can\u2019t prepare because the cost of change is simply too high to even consider it,\u201d he said. Drechsler told the Guardian he had become increasingly concerned about suggestions that leaving without a new trade deal with the rest of the EU would be manageable. \u201cThere are now a number of people around who seem to think no deal would be fine; WTO rules would be fine. The more I hear that, the more I worry that that becomes the narrative,\u201d he said. Recent Guardian analysis suggested reverting to WTO trading rules \u2013 an outcome sometimes referred to as \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2013 could cost firms up to \u00a36bn in increased tariffs alone. Drechsler said up to 90% of the value of Britain\u2019s exports to the EU would be hit either by export tariffs, or other non-tariff barriers such as burdensome regulations or costly customs checks. Amid concerns that the government is not thinking through the practical consequences for businesses of dropping out of the EU without a deal, Drechsler gave a series of examples to ram home his argument in his Mansion House speech. \u201cImagine you\u2019re a small cosmetics firm in Stockport and shops in France sell your products. No deal? Without an EU office it\u2019s illegal for those French shops to sell your products.

    "webTitle": "Agent Provocateur founder brands Mike Ashley's purchase 'a stitch-up'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The co-founder of Agent Provocateur has described the sale of the upmarket lingerie retailer to Mike Ashley as \u201ca disgrace to British business\u201d and \u201cpreposterous\u201d. Joe Corr\u00e9, the son of Dame Vivienne Westwood, warned that Ashley and 3i, the private equity fund has offloaded the brand, will \u201cface a phenomenal swath of litigation actions\u201d over the controversial deal. Ashley has bought Agent Provocateur for around \u00a330m through Four Holdings, the parent company of Four Marketing, a fashion agency which runs websites for luxury brands and owns their flagship stores. Sports Direct, Ashley\u2019s sportswear business, owns a 25% stake in Four Marketing. The deal has been completed through a pre-pack administration, whereby a business is placed into insolvency proceedings and its assets are immediately acquired by a new owner. Pre-packs have been heavily criticised because they allow the business to shed its debts to creditors, which can include suppliers and the taxman. AlixPartners, the administrator, 3i and Four Holdings declined to reveal the size of Agent Provocateur\u2019s debts. Barclays was the biggest creditor. Corr\u00e9 said: \u201cThe pre-pack arrangement between 3i and Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct is a disgrace to British business up there with Sir Philip Green\u2019s shocking behaviour over BHS. \u201cIf this preposterous deal goes ahead with Mike Ashley, 3i and their partners are going to face a phenomenal swath of litigation actions. 3i\u2019s reputation is going to be left in tatters. I don\u2019t think they will ever recover from this. This is a phenomenal stitch-up. \u201cJust how 3i have decided the right business model is to deliberately road crash the business to wipe out anything owed to creditors or the taxman is quite unbelievable, when a higher offer on the table avoids them taking such action. This is bad practice at its worst.\u201d The acquisition is the latest stage of an attempt by Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, to move his business empire upmarket. Alongside its core sportswear business, Sports Direct owns clothing chain Flannels and fashion brands such as Firetrap. Sky News reported earlier this week that Ashley had risen above private equity firm Lion Capital in a bidding war to acquire Agent Provocateur and the tycoon is understood to have been personally involved in the talks to buy the business. Peter Saville, managing director and head of retail restructuring at AlixPartners, said: \u201cWe would like to thank all the staff and stakeholders for their support during this process and we wish the business and its new owners all the best for future.\u201d Charles Perez, chief executive of Four Holdings, added: \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Agent Provocateur into the Four Holdings business. The global status of this brand provides significant opportunities and we are excited to begin working to further grow the brand equity.\u201d Sports Direct said it was \u201cfully supportive\u201d of the deal but did not provide details about if or how it will work with the Agent Provocateur. A spokesman said: \u201cWe have a 25% shareholding in Four Marketing and we are fully supportive of this acquisition.\u201d Agent Provocateur has struggled in recent years. Accounting irregularities were uncovered within the business last year, which were investigated by KPMG. This investigation found material misstatement in the way stock, costs and liabilities had been reported over a number of years. 3i wrote down the value of its 80% stake in the business by \u00a339m to reflect its problems, which included slowing sales. The private equity firm is unlikely to receive any of the proceeds from the sale. The structure of the deal as a pre-pack administration mean the funds will be paid to creditors of Agent Provocateur. 3i has claimed it provided funding to prop up the brand last year and tried to bring in investment to allow it to continue as a going concern, which was not possible. The brand employs around 600 people and has 11 shops in the UK. It was co-founded in 1994 by Corr\u00e9 and his now former wife Serena Rees. Its first shop was in Soho, London. 3i bought its stake for an estimated \u00a360m in 2007. At the time, Rees said: \u201cWe have provoked thought and reaction; we brought lingerie to the forefront of fashion, brought sexuality out into the open and have given sex a sense of luxury.\u201d Corr\u00e9 initially stayed with the company as creative director but left in 2009 and later sold his remaining shares. He was involved in a legal dispute with 3i before it sold the business to Ashley. Corr\u00e9 and Rees were both awarded MBEs for their services to the fashion industry in 2007 but Corr\u00e9 rejected the award, describing the then prime minister, Tony Blair, as \u201cmorally corrupt\u201d and not \u201csomeone capable of giving an honour\u201d. Corr\u00e9 claimed that 3i rejected a higher offer from Quadro Capital, an investment firm, that would have protected jobs and creditors. He said Ashley will \u201cpick at a carcass\u201d and plans \u201cto the keep the brand and the stock and nothing much else\u201d. However, sources close to 3i insist it had played no role in the selection of the buyer and that the sale process had been taken over by AlixPartners on behalf of Barclays after the failure to attract new investment into Agent Provocateur.",

This just in from Reuters\u2026 The indicative opening price for Snap Inc has edged up to $22-$24 a share. Shares in the Snapchat owner have an indicative opening price of $21-$23 a share.

Snap\u2019s chief executive Evan Spiegel and chief technology officer Bobby Murphy have rung the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Excitement is building ahead of Snap\u2019s debut trading session on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in the company behind the messaging app are expected to soar after the IPO was over subscribed by more than 10 times. After pricing its IPO at $17 a share, Snap has a market value of roughly $24bn. The US President is expected to speak to the Greek prime minister in the coming days. The substance of the call, according to well-placed sources, will be Greece\u2019s ongoing negotiations with creditors and the role the International Monetary Fund may or may not play in the country\u2019s current rescue programme. Donald Trump has publicly tweeted that he thinks the Greeks are \u201cwasting their time\u201d staying in the eurozone. As the largest shareholder in the IMF, with a 17% share of the body\u2019s voting power, Washington has effective veto power over many decisions. The IMF has yet to sign up to Greece\u2019s third bailout programme, with Germany and the Netherlands saying its participation is vital if further emergency loans are to be disbursed to the debt-stricken country. \u201cThe government is attaching great significance to the conversation in its bid to get a clearer picture of Trump\u2019s position on several issues, not least the Greek bailout program,\u201d the Kathimerini news paper wrote today. With tensions also rising in the Aegean between regional rivals Greece and Turkey, Athens is also placing stock in Washington\u2019s interventionist powers, diplomats say. President Barack Obama, who chose to give his farewell speech abroad in the Greek capital, was aggressively supportive of Greece remaining in the single currency, stepping in when the country came closest yet to leaving the euro six months after Tsipras assumed power in mid-2015. Trump\u2019s Whitehouse chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is of Greek descent, told a visiting Greek delegation ahead of the president\u2019s swearing-in that the new administration was determined to \u201cfix Greece\u201d, although he failed to make clear whether he meant in or out of the eurozone. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near 44-year low last week, beating expectations. There were 223,000 new claims in the week ending 25 February, lower than the 243,000 predicted by economists and lower than 242,000 posted a week earlier. It was the lowest since March 1973, the US Labor Department said, and the 104th week in a row that claims were below 300,000 - a threshold associated with a healthy labour market. Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, is hoping to snap up Agent Provocateur. The upmarket lingerie is expected to enter administration on Thursday with Sports Direct the favourite to buy the business out of insolvency proceedings. Sky News reported earlier this week that Ashley had gone higher than private equity firm Lion Capital in a bidding war. Agent Provocateur is owned by private equity firm 3i but the brand has struggled in recent years. 3i wrote down the value of its 80% stake in the business by \u00a339m last year to reflect its problems and accounting irregularities were also uncovered. Read our full story here: A \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit is one of the biggest threats facing the Irish economy according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Another is the prospect of US corporate tax reforms. Moody\u2019s stresses however that Ireland\u2019s growth prospects remain strong. Kathrin Muehlbronner, a Moody\u2019s senior vice president and author of the report explains on the risks posed by Brexit: Ireland has been growing strongly since 2014 and we expect it to continue to do so in the coming years. But the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU could bring significant disruption to Ireland as the UK aims for a free trade agreement rather than participation in the single market. Brexit will likely mean lower export growth, deeper disruption to well-established supply chains and the need to establish controls at the border with the UK, its second-largest export market after the United States. Higher foreign direct investment inflows could mitigate some of the negative impact, as Ireland will likely be a key beneficiary from the diversion of investment from the UK. However, Ireland faces important supply constraints, in particular in the area of housing and might not be able to realise its full FDI potential. And the risks posed by US corporate tax reform: There is now the prospect of major corporate tax reforms in the US which constitutes an additional risk for Ireland\u2019s foreign direct investment-focused economic model. The scale of [this] risk to the Irish economy is still unclear as details of any US corporate tax rule changes have yet to be announced. But multinational companies are a crucial part of Ireland\u2019s economic success and Ireland\u2019s low corporate tax rate has been an important driver for foreign direct investment in the country. Multinationals originating from the US account for around half of all foreign companies located in Ireland, implying that big changes in US corporate tax rules could heavily affect Ireland. In Moody\u2019s view, new investment inflows into Ireland could be materially lower, while Ireland\u2019s public finances would also be negatively affected. Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation data earlier, which showed a pick-up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% a month earlier. Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says the inflation rise will prove temporary. February\u2019s rise in euro-zone consumer price inflation put it in line with the ECB\u2019s 2% price stability ceiling for the first time since January 2013, but underlying price pressures remain subdued. The pick-up entirely reflected higher energy and food inflation while the core rate was unchanged at just 0.9%. Florian Hense, economist at the German bank Berenberg, agrees, and suggests the European Central Bank will not feel the need to tighten policy at next week\u2019s meeting: The ECB will not have to rethink the thrust of its policies. The ECB will be very cautious not to make the same mistake it did in 2011 when it ended up hiking rates in April and July, just a few months before the Euro crisis erupted. Would you be happy to travel in a driverless car? The Guardian\u2019s Gwyn Topham took a spin around East London in a self-driving electric Nissan Leaf. Here\u2019s what happened: And the story in full: Moving over to Greece now, where the main opposition leader says the government is deliberately drawing out negotiations with creditors and preparing the country for a fourth bailout. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Seven years after it was granted its first emergency loan programme, Greece is being prepared for a fourth bailout, says Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who heads the main opposition centre right New Democracy party. In a wide ranging interview aired on Ant 1 TV on Wednesday night, the politician said prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 acceptance of further pension cuts and tax reforms was tantamount to a new adjustment programme that New Democracy would not be backing. This government cannot get the country out of the impasse it is in. We will have additional measures that will reduce the tax-free threshold and reduce pensions. Mr Tsipras is encumbering citizens with the bill. He is not moving ahead with reforms. He can\u2019t create jobs or attract investments. In essence he is bringing a fourth bailout through the backdoor. Mitsotakis, who held talks in Berlin with the German chancellor Angela Merkel recently, said the leftist government was deliberately delaying bailout talks with creditors. The [second bailout] review should have been concluded a year ago. The government is consciously delaying [it] for reasons of domestic consumption. There is a big danger that entry into the [ECB\u2019s] quantitative easing [programme] will be missed. The spectre of yet more cuts has caused rising alarm in Greece with pensioners taking to the streets. It comes as the Cologne Institute for Economic research says poverty in Greece has shot up by 40 % between 2008 and 2015. \u201cGreece is the big loser,\u201d the think tank said in its latest study on the European economy, pointing out that the increase was the biggest among EU member states. President Trump is awake and tweeting about his impact on markets: The weak spots in the construction PMI survey have helped to push the pound to a six-week low against the dollar. Sterling fell 0.25% to $1.2259 against a broadly stronger dollar. It also hit a two-week low against the euro, with one euro worth 85.90p. Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said the outlook for the pound was very much dependent on how quickly Theresa May can push ahead with Brexit plans. If she can trigger Brexit as per her deadline, it may push sterling even lower as this will send the message that Theresa May is in full control and her hard Brexit is taking shape. On the flip side, if she cannot deliver this on time, this could be a positive thing for sterling, and the currency could rally all the way to $1.28, with a potential target of $1.30 a realistic target as well. Earlier the Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI suggested activity in the sector grew in February at a similar pace to January. The headline index edged up to 52.5 from 52.2, where anything above 50 signals expansion. Civil engineers reported an acceleration in growth, while growth in housing construction slowed slightly. Construction of commercial buildings such as offices and shops slowed. Firms were fairly upbeat according to Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit and author of the report, but there were reports of weakening demand: February\u2019s survey data highlights that the UK construction sector has rebounded from its post- referendum soft patch but remains on a relatively slow growth trajectory. Weaker momentum in the house building sector was a key factor weighing on construction growth, alongside a renewed fall in work commercial projects. There was little sign that the UK storms had a material impact on construction growth in February, although some firms noted that longer delivery times for roof tiles had added to supply chain issues. Instead, survey respondents mainly cited an underlying slowdown in sales growth, with the latest rise in new work the weakest for four months. Cost pressures in the sector remained at an eight-and-a-half year high, as the sharp drop in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote pushes up the price of materials and goods imported from abroad. The eurozone\u2019s unemployment rate was unchanged in January at 9.6% - the lowest since May 2009. There were 15.2 million unemployed people in the region, down 56,000 compared with December. Greece has the highest jobless rate in the eurozone at 23%, while Germany has the lowest at 3.8%. Youth unemployment also fell in January, by 198,000 compared with a year earlier to 2.8 million. The youth unemployment rate remains high at 20%. The highest rate is 45.7% in Greece, and the lowest is 6.5% in Germany. The headline rate of inflation in the eurozone rose to 2% in February from 1.8% in January, bang in line with expectations. Eurostat, the region\u2019s statistics office, said energy prices, food, alcohol and tobacco were the main drivers of the rise. Shares in the outsourcing group Capita are down 9% after the company revealed a 33% fall in annual profits and said its chief executive Andy Parker was stepping down. It follows confirmation that the company, which operates the London congestion charge, is to be relegated from the FTSE 100 because of a sharp fall in the share price. Parker commented on his departure: 2016 has been a difficult year for Capita but the Company is now a simpler, more focussed group with a clear service offering and growth strategy, and a plan to achieve a stronger balance sheet. We have achieved a great deal but going forward it is time for a new leader to take Capita through the next steps to renewed and sustainable organic growth. If you\u2019re feeling nostalgic following the news that the Football Pools is being sold for \u00a383m, below is a potted history of the former British staple. At its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, the pools had 15 million regular punters, helped by an army of door-to-door coupon collectors. The Football Pools, once a staple of the British Saturday teatime, is about to change hands in an \u00a383m deal. Its owner, London-listed betting company Sportech, has agreed to sell the football lottery game to a company controlled by funds advised by European private equity investors OpCapita. The conditional sale agreement comes after a near-\u00a3100m sale of the Football Pools to its management team fell through in November. The Football Pools dates back to 1923 and has struggled against the National Lottery, but is still popular with about 300,000 stalwarts who spend an average of just over \u00a33 a week in the hope of scooping the maximum price of \u00a33m. The business was formed from the merger of the three big pools operators, Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters between 2000 and 2007. The pools will still move into new premises in Liverpool city centre. John Von Spreckelsen, chairman of OpCapita: We are delighted to be acquiring the Football Pools, which occupies a unique place in British culture. Sportech has successfully modernised the business and we look forward to realising its significant growth potential. As part of that growth strategy, we plan to ensure existing loyal customers continue to enjoy the game and bring the Football Pools, already loved by so many, to an even wider audience. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst, at ETX Capital, says Snap\u2019s debut in New York coincides with a period of bullishness among investors: Snap shares look set to fly when they begin trading in New York today after being priced at $17, above its target range. With the Dow closing above 21,000 for the first time the IPO comes at an incredibly bullish point for US, and indeed global, equities. Of course such bullishness is reminiscent of the dotcom bubble and this could be a high watermark for the market. The offer was 10 times over-subscribed, making a strong case for the stock to pop on the open. Big institutional funds will step in to the main market to add to their holdings, forcing up the price. Lessons to be learned from Facebook\u2019s IPO? We\u2019ve also seen huge retail client interest in Snap shares \u2013 this is as big as the Facebook IPO in terms of the hype and buzz around it. But trading in Snap shares could be choppy today. It could be pricing high and selling low. Facebook again is instructive \u2013 it endured a rocky start to life on the public markets, sliding from its IPO price before turning things around. Of course its IPO was beset by technical problems that the US exchanges are keen to avoid this time. There is also a sense that the shares could be overpriced, based on some key fundamentals. Shares in Snap, the American technology company behind the messaging app Snapchat, will start trading in New York today. Shares are expected to soar after it raised $3.4bn (\u00a32.9bn) in its initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday, above its price expectations. Snap\u2019s IPO was over-subscribed by more than 10 times, suggesting demand for shares will be strong when trading gets underway. Reuters notes: After pricing its IPO at $17 a share, the owner of the popular disappearing-message app has a market value of roughly $24 billion, more than double the size of rival Twitter Inc and the richest valuation in a US tech IPO since Facebook five years ago. The share sale was the first test of investor appetite for a social-media app that is beloved by teenagers and people under 30 for applying bunny faces and vomiting rainbows onto selfies, but has yet to convert \u201ccool\u201d into cash. The FTSE 100 might only be up 4 points or 0.1% at 7,387 but it\u2019s a new record high. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says investors are on a high following Trump\u2019s spending pledges despite the fact the President has yet to provide any detail. Equities analysts and strategists including myself have been arguing for some time that if no further details were provided on how and when the proposed US tax reforms and spending plans will take place, the market rally should take a pause. However, US President Donald Trump provided no new details in his speech to Congress on Tuesday, and yet, stocks surged to new highs. He also points out that rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this month are also driving shares higher... usually such expectations would have the opposite effect as investors remain hooked on stimulus as the hangover from the financial crisis persists. Sayed says: What\u2019s even more interesting is markets now consider a tighter monetary policy a sign of confidence in economic growth and thus a reason to continue purchasing stocks, when for years post 2008 crisis it had been considered the most significant motive to dump stocks. Does the market rally have legs? There\u2019s no doubt that improved economic conditions, consumer confidence, and higher inflation will all lead to higher earnings growth, but what markets are currently pricing in is more than just these factors. It\u2019s mainly about tax reforms, and assuming a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax from 35% to 20%, although difficult to calculate its impact on earnings, is expected to lift net profits from 10% to 15%, and this is what investors are betting on. If you still want to ride the current bullish momentum wave, pray that Trump\u2019s tax reduction plan succeeds as soon as possible. The spotlight is on key elections coming up in Europe and all bets are off following Britain\u2019s shock Brexit vote and America\u2019s decision to install Donald Trump in the White House. Could the Netherlands deliver the next surprise? Here is a useful guide to the Dutch elections on 15 March: As markets settle following a record-breaking run, investors await the flash eurozone inflation rate for February, to be published at 10am. If economists polled by Reuters get it right, and the headline rate rises to 2% from 1.8% in January, Mario Draghi is likely to come under renewed pressure over the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus measures. Specifically, pressure could build on the president of the ECB to announce policy tightening at next week\u2019s meeting of the governing council. We\u2019ll bring you the figure and reaction when it comes. The FTSE 100 is up slightly this morning, rising 0.1% or four points to 7,387. Elsewhere in Europe major markets are up with the exception of Spain. German\u2019s DAX: +0.03% at 12,071 France\u2019s CAC: +0.2% at 4,9781 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.01% at 19,367 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.04% at 9,748 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 376 The FTSE 250, which is more domestically focused on the UK than the FTSE 100, is down 0.1% at 18,961. Britain is in the midst of the weakest growth in living standards in at least 60 years, with low income families faring the worst, the Institute for Fiscal Studies is warning today. In a pretty gloomy report on poverty, inequality, and living standards, the thinktank says household incomes will not grow at all over the next two years. On average, by 2021-22, families will be \u00a35,000 a year worse off than they might have reasonably expected back in 2007-08 before the financial crisis took hold. Inequality and child poverty are also expected to rise over the next five years as a direct result of government policies. Andrew Hood, an author of the report and a senior research economist at IFS, explains: Weak earnings growth combined with planned benefit cuts means that the absolute poverty rate among children is projected to be roughly the same in 2021\u201322 as it was back in 2007\u201308. In the decade before that, it fell by a third. Tax and benefit changes planned for this parliament explain all of the projected increase in absolute child poverty between 2014\u201315 and 2021\u201322. A Treasury spokesperson has responded to the report: We are taking action to support families with the costs of living by cutting taxes for millions of working people, doubling free childcare for nearly 400,000 working parents and introducing the National Living Wage \u2013 a significant pay rise for the lowest earners. More people are now in work than ever before with living standards also forecast to rise over this Parliament. Here is our full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. President Trump\u2019s pledge to go on a major spending spree drove a surge in investor optimism, pushing indices on both sides of the Atlantic to fresh record highs on Wednesday. Asia followed Wall Street higher this morning with the Hang Seng and Nikkei both just about in positive territory. CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson has this take on investor mood: Records tumbled one after the other yesterday as equity markets across the world went on a tear in the wake of US President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to spend up to $1trn on rebuilding the infrastructure of the United States, with the FTSE100 and FTSE250 both making an closing at new record highs, as the reflation trade took another leg higher. US markets also surged with the Dow opening above 21,000 and the S&amp;P500 also hitting new record highs above 2,400, as markets posted their best one day gain of 2017. Also coming up day we have the flash estimate of eurozone inflation which is expected to show a pick up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% in January, potentially causing problems for Mario Draghi. We also have eurozone unemployment. In the UK we have the latest snapshot of construction from the PMI survey for February. And over in the US we have weekly jobless claims figures. We will be bringing you all the latest developments as the day unfolds.",

But the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU could bring significant disruption to Ireland as the UK aims for a free trade agreement rather than participation in the single market. </p> <p>Brexit will likely mean lower export growth, deeper disruption to well-established supply chains and the need to establish controls at the border with the UK, its second-largest export market after the United States. </p> <p>Higher foreign direct investment inflows could mitigate some of the negative impact, as Ireland will likely be a key beneficiary from the diversion of investment from the UK. However, Ireland faces important supply constraints, in particular in the area of housing and might not be able to realise its full FDI potential.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And the risks posed by US corporate tax reform:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is now the prospect of major corporate tax reforms in the US which constitutes an additional risk for Ireland\u2019s foreign direct investment-focused economic model.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The scale of [this] risk to the Irish economy is still unclear as details of any US corporate tax rule changes have yet to be announced. But multinational companies are a crucial part of Ireland\u2019s economic success and Ireland\u2019s low corporate tax rate has been an important driver for foreign direct investment in the country. </p> <p>Multinationals originating from the US account for around half of all foreign companies located in Ireland, implying that big changes in US corporate tax rules could heavily affect Ireland. In Moody\u2019s view, new investment inflows into Ireland could be materially lower, while Ireland\u2019s public finances would also be negatively affected.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b8073fe4b09c1763ef5648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-02T12:17:31.356Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some reaction now to the eurozone inflation data earlier, which showed a pick-up in the headline rate to 2% in February from 1.8% a month earlier.</p> <p><strong>Jennifer McKeown</strong>, chief European economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, says the inflation rise will prove temporary. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> February\u2019s rise in euro-zone consumer price inflation put it in line with the ECB\u2019s 2% price stability ceiling for the first time since January 2013, but underlying price pressures remain subdued.

We will have additional measures that will reduce the tax-free threshold and reduce pensions. Mr Tsipras is encumbering citizens with the bill. He is not moving ahead with reforms. He can\u2019t create jobs or attract investments. In essence he is bringing a fourth bailout through the backdoor.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mitsotakis, who held talks in Berlin with the German chancellor Angela Merkel recently, said the leftist government was deliberately delaying bailout talks with creditors. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [second bailout] review should have been concluded a year ago.

Weaker momentum in the house building sector was a key factor weighing on construction growth, alongside a renewed fall in work commercial projects. </p> <p>There was little sign that the UK storms had a material impact on construction growth in February, although some firms noted that longer delivery times for roof tiles had added to supply chain issues. Instead, survey respondents mainly cited an underlying slowdown in sales growth, with the latest rise in new work the weakest for four months. </p> </blockquote> <p>Cost pressures in the sector remained at an eight-and-a-half year high, as the sharp drop in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote pushes up the price of materials and goods imported from abroad.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b7eec5e4b047c20d90497a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-02T10:20:59.016Z\">10.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The eurozone\u2019s unemployment rate was unchanged in January at 9.6% - the lowest since May 2009.</strong></p> <p>There were 15.2 million unemployed people in the region, down 56,000 compared with December.</p> <p>Greece has the highest jobless rate in the eurozone at 23%, while Germany has the lowest at 3.8%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"958674add93877927d7f432514d4fa6e54f689ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/958674add93877927d7f432514d4fa6e54f689ec/0_0_991_433/500.jpg\" alt=\"Eurozone jobs\" width=\"500\" height=\"218\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Youth unemployment</strong> also fell in January, by 198,000 compared with a year earlier to 2.8 million.</p> <p>The youth unemployment rate remains high at 20%.

It\u2019s mainly about tax reforms, and assuming a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax from 35% to 20%, although difficult to calculate its impact on earnings, is expected to lift net profits from 10% to 15%, and this is what investors are betting on. <br></p> <p> If you still want to ride the current bullish momentum wave, pray that Trump\u2019s tax reduction plan succeeds as soon as possible. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b7d7d6e4b047c20d904921\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-02T08:47:22.116Z\">8.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The spotlight is on key elections coming up in Europe and all bets are off following Britain\u2019s shock Brexit vote and America\u2019s decision to install Donald Trump in the White House.</p> <p>Could the Netherlands deliver the next surprise?

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of BT has said that rampant inflation in the prices paid for TV sports rights must come to an end, as the telecoms giant takes on rival Sky in the \u00a31bn-plus battle for Champions League football. First-round bids for Champions League rights are understood to have been submitted this week, with governing body Uefa aiming for an up to 30% increase from the new deal, to as much as \u00a31.2bn. BT paid \u00a3900m to poach the exclusive rights from Sky under the existing deal. Ahead of a decision on the next three-year deal, which could be announced as soon as next week, BT chief Gavin Patterson said that \u201crampant inflation in sports rights\u201d has to end. Patterson, who has been dealing with the fallout from a huge accounting scandal that has cost the company more than \u00a3500m to date, said that a limited period of inflation was expected after BT drove a 70% rise in the value of the Premier League rights when it won a large slice of rights previously held by Sky to launch BT Sport in 2012. Speaking at the annual Enders Analysis conference in London, the BT boss insisted uncontrolled increases in prices could not carry on. \u201cNaturally when we came in [to the market] there would [always be] be some inflation. At some point it will stabilise ... The sport market is pretty saturated in terms of viewers and consumption today. I do hope at some point in the future we can find a stable equilibrium.\u201d The Champions League is considered to be a critical litmus test as to whether price inflation will continue at such high rates. To date both Sky and BT have attempted to play down expectations of a bidding war. But in January John Petter, chief executive of BT\u2019s consumer division that runs BT Sport, accused Sky of having too much dominance of sports rights and said that BT\u2019s preference was to keep the Champions League. Patterson appeared to play down BT\u2019s appetite for an at-any-cost bidding war for the Champions League, saying that the company did not necessarily need to regain exclusive broadcast rightsto achieve its aims. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be number one in the sports market, but we do need to be a viable number two,\u201d he said. BT is understood to have held talks with potential free-to-air partners. Channel 4 in particular has been named as a potential partner. Champions League sponsors have expressed concerns to Uefa about the lack of exposure under the current BT deal. Previously the rights had been split between Sky and ITV. Several observers say that Sky, which is the subject of an \u00a311.7bn takeover by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox, does not appear to have the appetite to lodge a blockbuster bid for Champions League football. They say that Sky could be keeping its powder dry to make sure it can secure the lion\u2019s share of the crown jewel Premier League rights when the next three-year deal is struck. Furious competition between BT and Sky saw the Premier League secure an enormous \u00a35.14bn deal last time. Sky may also be wary of the public relations impact of mounting knockout bids for both Champions League and Premier League rights if Fox\u2019s deal to take 100% control of the pay-TV company is cleared by competition regulators and the UK government. Rival broadcasters opposed to Fox\u2019s proposed takeover are preparing to lodge complaints with regulators in the UK and Europe after expressing concerns that the pay-TV broadcaster will dominate bidding for top-flight sport, TV shows and movies. James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox, said that a combined Fox/Sky, which would own operations in the UK, Germany and Italy, would not look to push out rivals for premium sports rights. \u201cIt isn\u2019t really about muscle \u2013 it is about trying to find what is the right balance for sports leagues to maximise returns and increase the quality of play,\u201d he said. \u201cRightsholders dictate terms of how they are going to auction or licence their product. It is not a question of leverage and muscle.\u201d The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, is expected to start a 10-day assessment of the deal next week to see if it warrants asking Ofcom, the media regulator, to look at concerns such as media plurality.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A self-driving car has had its first trials on major London roads, proving the technology works \u2013 or it does with an attentive driver behind the wheel to slam on the brakes. Guided by five radars, four lasers and 12 cameras, a converted electric Nissan Leaf has been following a carefully mapped route around Beckton, in east London, driving itself along the A13 dual carriageway, around urban streets and navigating roundabouts \u2013 a particular challenge for the Japanese manufacturer. Nissan tested the car on Wednesday with the Guardian in the passenger seat. Britain has established a liberal testing regime for driverless vehicles, in the hope of taking a leading global role in their development, but legislation still demands a qualified driver at the wheel \u2013 just in case. That driver was Tetsuya Iijima, Nissan\u2019s global head of autonomous drive development, who wiggled his feet and held his arms aloft as the Leaf proceeded out of the Excel centre car park. Its steering wheel turning unaided, the Leaf accelerated past City airport, and towards its first roundabout. Screens attached to the Leaf dashboard include a virtual map, a camera view, and one pinpointing green cones in our path picked up by laser and radar: these were the unsuspecting pedestrians of Beckton. A voice informs us: \u201cTurning right\u201d \u2013 like a satnav with free will. None of these accoutrements was necessary, explained Iijima, except to reassure the human passengers. \u201cTrust is very important,\u201d said Iijima. Trust was briefly jeopardised at the roundabout, however, when Iijima grabbed the steering wheel to avoid a lorry in the neighbouring lane, and braked swiftly to stop the car autonomously rear-ending a Honda Civic with P-plates. \u201cSome bugs,\u201d said Iijima. \u201cIt\u2019s a prototype.\u201d Nonetheless, the Leaf drove itself on to the dual-carriageway A13, switching lanes and reaching a steady 50mph before turning off to head down the part-residential Prince Regent Lane. Parked cars, oncoming traffic and lack of proper lane markings make it a real test for the car, Iijima said. More than 90% of car accidents are caused by their human drivers, several of whom in Beckton seemed thrown by a car scrupulously observing speed limits, traffic signs and red lights. Iijima had to grab the wheel again as the Leaf was cut up by a BMW, and once more as a car behind attempted to change lanes at the same time. But it handled a zebra crossing, another British feature that tested Nissan\u2019s programmers, with no danger of pedestrian casualties, and returned to Excel without mishap. \u201cYou weren\u2019t scared?\u201d asked Iijima, who said it was his worst test drive yet. However, he added: \u201cWe still have three years.\u201d That deadline is when Nissan hopes to have fully autonomous cars ready as showpiece taxis for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Much of the technology will be available in cars before that, with the capability for autonomous single lane driving to be included in its Qashqai models this year, and in cars able to drive on highways and motorways available in 2018 \u2013 a phased approach that Nissan hopes will see the public gradually embrace the benefits of no longer having to drive themselves. By 2020, cars from Nissan (and other manufacturers) should be capable of driving on urban roads and intersections. Public perception, infrastructure and legislation on questions such as insurance will be the factors delaying widespread implementation, rather than technology, manufacturers believe. While Nissan suggested again this week that its plans could be altered by Brexit, the company said the UK offering opportunities for driverless cars and electric models such as the Leaf would make it an obvious choice. Hayato Akizuki, a senior technology planner at Nissan, said: \u201cThe UK is more advanced in Europe for testing purposes. And it would be better if a driverless car of the future was not to be a gas-guzzler.\u201d He believes that they could be commonplace by 2025: \u201cTechnology-wise it is possible; it depends on the business case. People may not want a driverless car for themselves - but car-sharing or taxi firms could do.\u201d Nissan conducted on-road trials in Japan and Silicon Valley in late 2015 and 2016, but these were its first such tests in Europe. Tests of prototype vehicles have taken place on local roads in Britain, including in Bristol, Greenwich and Milton Keynes, while Jaguar Land Rover will soon be testing autonomous cars on roads in the West Midlands. Volvo plans trial a self-driving car on a selected family\u2019s daily commute in London later this year. Jim Holder, editorial director of What Car, said: \u201cNissan were the first to produce a mass-market electric car and they are trying to position themselves as leaders for autonomy as well as propulsion. To have the confidence to put it on public streets is a significant step on a long journey to self-driving cars.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Asda, Britain\u2019s third largest supermarket chain and owner of the George brand, is imposing harsher payment terms on its clothing suppliers as it attempts to turn the business around. A letter sent on Tuesday to international suppliers warned they will now have to wait 50% longer to receive payment, as it extends its terms from 60 to 90 days. The letter, seen by the Guardian, was sent by Alex Russo, chief finance officer and Andrew Moore, chief merchandising officer. They wrote: \u201cWe have recently undergone a further review of our payment terms and having considered the situation carefully, we have now made the decision to extend terms to 90 days. \u201cAs such, from 28 May 2017, all payment terms for import suppliers will move to 90 days.\u201d Asda, owned by American giant Walmart, is one of the first retailers to tighten the screw on manufacturers after the Brexit vote. Its George business, along with most of the big clothing chains, will have been hit by the falling value of the pound because it uses US dollars to buy most of its fashion lines. Pounds taken at its tills now buy fewer dollars because of the slide in sterling. Delaying payments to suppliers has become a common tactic used by retailers seeking financial breathing space. It boosts the cash in their businesses but hurts smaller manufacturers who are forced to wait longer for payment. Some have to borrow to pay staff and settle bills. In some cases it causes cashflow issues and can make the difference between the survival and failure. One Asda supplier, who asked not to be named, said: \u201cAsda already drives a hard bargain on price so this is all the more irritating in what are difficult trading conditions. We will have to wait another 30 days to pay our suppliers and staff. If someone delays paying us how are we supposed to pay our bills?\u201d Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \u201cPoor payment practices by big firms are responsible for killing off thousands of smaller businesses a year and threatening the existence of many others. \u201cThis yet again highlights the need for a crackdown on late payments, which I hope will be top of the list for the government\u2019s new small business commissioner.\u201d Asda has been under intense pressure to reverse its fortunes after food shoppers flocked to discounters Aldi and Lidl and customers looking for cheap clothes migrated to Primark. It is the weakest of the big four grocers and its sales have lagged behind Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. Last month it posted its 10th consecutive quarter of negative sales growth. A spokesperson for Asda said: \u201cHaving reviewed industry standards, we have advised our clothing import suppliers of our intention to amend our payment terms to 90 days. \u201cWe work hard to build strong relationships with our suppliers and continue to offer a number of different finance and support options that allow them to access funding earlier if they require it.\u201d Asda would not say whether it would pass on the increased costs on George lines to customers. In January rival Next warned shoppers could face price rises of up to 5% in 2017. \u2022This article was amended on 2 March to make it clear that the length of time suppliers may have to wait for payment has not been extended by a third, but a half",

      "bodyText": "More than half of the buyers of new homes have experienced major problems with their properties, according to research, which comes after Bovis Homes agreed to pay \u00a37m compensation to customers for poorly built houses. A YouGov survey for the housing charity Shelter found that 51% of homeowners of recent new builds in England said they had experienced major problems including issues with construction, unfinished fittings and faults with utilities. The survey, which polled 4,341 UK adults online, was published alongside a Shelter report that concluded that the housebuilding sector is rigged in favour of big developers and land traders rather than families looking for homes. The current speculative system of housebuilding is failing families by producing expensive, yet poor-quality homes, according to the report, published after the government branded the housing market \u201cbroken\u201d in its recent housing white paper. Eight in 10 working families who are renting privately cannot afford to buy a newly built home \u2013 even if they use the government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme, Shelter said. The West Midlands ranked as the worst region, with 93% of families unable to purchase an average-priced new home. In the report, titled New Civic Housebuilding, the charity calls for a return to building good-quality, affordable homes like the model villages for Cadbury workers at Bournville, the red brick developments of the Peabody and Guinness estates, the Victorian and Georgian terraces in Edinburgh and Bath, and the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn. The YouGov poll showed 41% of homeowners disagreed with the statement \u201cI would prefer to live in a new home rather than an older one\u201d; 29% agreed, and 26% neither agreed nor disagreed. And 45% disagreed with the statement \u201cNew homes are built to a higher standard than older homes\u201d; 22% agreed and 23% were neutral. The findings come amid rising complaints about poor building standards in new homes and the regulation of the sector. Critics claim the National House Building Council (NHBC), which checks new homes for defects and provides 10-year warranties for most new homes in Britain, is too close to the housebuilders and is failing in its duty to protect consumers. Last week Bovis Homes\u2019 interim boss, Earl Sibley, apologised to customers as the company set aside \u00a37m to pay compensation and to fix shoddily built new homes, with many customers reporting hundreds of \u201csnags\u201d after moving in. Shelter called for a shake-up of the housebuilding sector, with a bigger role for development corporations, which have specific powers (such as the Olympic Delivery Authority) \u2013 they can give planning permission and acquire land, if necessary compulsorily, at reasonable prices. Other recent examples of \u201ccivic\u201d building cited by Shelter include the Duchy of Cornwall\u2019s housing developments at Newquay; community-led developments in Streatham and Wilburton in East Cambridgeshire, and Derwenthorpe, where the Joseph Rowntree Trust, a housing association, teamed up with the city of York council to build nearly 500 homes \u2013 more than 100 years after Joseph Rowntree built York\u2019s garden village of New Earswick. Shelter wants the government to step in to ensure these models are scaled up and become more common \u2013 to top up the homes built by the big housebuilders, which are currently only constructing half the 250,000 homes needed in Britain every year. Toby Lloyd, who co-authored the report, said: \u201cWe need government to prioritise bringing more land forward at lower cost, by giving local authorities more powers, setting up development corporations and using public land in smarter ways than simply selling it to the highest bidder.\u201d Public land should be invested in public-private partnerships to deliver affordable homes and generate long-term revenues for the public sector. Shelter also proposes an equity partnership model to bring down the cost of land, which would see landowners put their land into a business partnership as equity over the long term, benefitting from rising values year after year \u2013 rather than taking a one-off windfall payment. The report explains: \u201cThe most important risk taken by a speculative developer is how much to pay for a plot of land. This is fundamental to the speculative housebuilding model as land is often the single largest cost in building homes, especially in the areas which need homes most.\u201d Graeme Brown, Shelter\u2019s interim chief executive, said: \u201cFor decades we\u2019ve relied on this broken system and, despite the sweeteners offered to developers to build the homes we need, it simply hasn\u2019t worked. The current way of building homes has had its day and it has failed the nation.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "IFS: Growth in UK living standards worst in 60 years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain is in the midst of the weakest growth in living standards in at least 60 years, with low income families faring the worst, a leading thinktank has warned. Weak earnings growth, together with changes to taxes and benefits, will lead to a rise in inequality by 2021-22, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). In a new report on living standards, poverty and inequality, the IFS says incomes for the average family will not grow at all over the next two years. The IFS calculated that average household incomes will be 18% lower in 2021-22 than could have been reasonably expected in 2007-08, before the global financial crisis took hold of the economy. It means a childless couple would be about \u00a35,900 a year worse off than they might otherwise have been, rising to \u00a38,300 for a couple with two young children. The IFS said it amounted to the most sustained slowdown in income growth since comparable records began in 1961. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which funded the report, urged the chancellor Philip Hammond to announce measures to support struggling families in next week\u2019s budget. \u201cThese troubling forecasts show millions of families across the country are teetering on a precipice, with 400,000 pensioners and over one million more children likely to fall into poverty and suffer the very real and awful consequences that brings if things do not change. \u201cOne of the biggest drivers of the rise in child poverty is policy choices, which is why it is essential that the prime minister and chancellor use the upcoming budget to put in place measures to stop this happening. An excellent start would be to ensure families can keep more of their earnings under the universal credit.\u201d If benefit cuts are implemented as planned, the poorest 15% of the population are likely to have lower incomes in five years\u2019 time as a freeze in benefits and universal credit \u2013 which on average will be less than the benefits it replaces \u2013 take their toll. \u201cLooking forward, we expect the fall in inequality since the recession to be reversed,\u201d the IFS said. The thinktank pointed to lower working-age benefits, which mainly affect less well-off families, as one of the key reasons why the gap between the rich and poor is expected to rise. Economists have warned that household finances will come under increasing pressure this year as inflation rises but wage growth remains weak. The sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote is starting to feed through to the headline rate of inflation, which rose to 1.8% in January, the highest level in more than two years. It is expected to rise further in the coming months, hitting about 3% in early 2018. Meanwhile the latest official figures on wages showed pay growth slowed unexpectedly to 2.6% in the final quarter of 2016, despite record rates of employment. Responding to the IFS report, a spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cWe are taking action to support families with the costs of living by cutting taxes for millions of working people, doubling free childcare for nearly 400,000 working parents and introducing the \u201cnational living wage\u201d \u2013 a significant pay rise for the lowest earners. More people are now in work than ever before with living standards also forecast to rise over this parliament.\u201d Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the number of children living in UK households where no adult is working has fallen to its lowest level since recent records began two decades ago, at 10.7%. Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cMore parents now have the opportunity to find work and enjoy the dignity and security of having a regular wage. \u201cWe will continue to build on this success as we roll out universal credit to all parts of the country \u2013 ensuring that it always pays to be in work.\u201d The IFS said average pensioner incomes are likely to rise twice as quickly as those for the rest of the population, if earnings growth projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) \u2013 the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster \u2013 prove correct. By 2021-22, average pensioner income is likely to be 24% higher than it was in 2007-08, the thinktank said. Pensioner incomes have benefited from real growth in the level of the state pension, people staying on in employment at older ages, and a change in the composition of pensioners, with the newly retiring tending to have larger private pension entitlements than previous cohorts of pensioners. Child poverty is projected to rise from 27.5% in 2014-15 to about 30% in 2021-22, returning to its pre-recession level. The IFS said the rise was explained by tax and benefit reforms planned for this parliament, particularly the cuts to working-age benefits,. Andrew Hood, an author of the report and a senior research economist at the IFS, said: \u201cWeak earnings growth combined with planned benefit cuts mean that the absolute poverty rate among children is projected to be roughly the same in 2021-22 as it was in 2007-08.

      "body": "<p>Britain is in the midst of the weakest growth in living standards in at least 60 years, with low income families faring the worst, a leading thinktank has warned.</p> <p>Weak earnings growth, together with changes to taxes and benefits, will lead to a rise in inequality by 2021-22, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). In a new report on living standards, poverty and inequality, the IFS says incomes for the average family will not grow at all over the next two years.</p> <p>The IFS calculated that average household incomes will be 18% lower in 2021-22 than could have been reasonably expected in 2007-08, before the global financial crisis took hold of the economy. It means a childless couple would be about \u00a35,900 a year worse off than they might otherwise have been, rising to \u00a38,300 for a couple with two young children.</p> <p>The IFS said it amounted to the most sustained slowdown in income growth since comparable records began in 1961. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which funded the report, urged the chancellor Philip Hammond to announce measures to support struggling families in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/28/spring-budget-2017-government-resolution-foundation\">next week\u2019s budget</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2017-03-01T16:59:43/embed.html\" data-alt=\"IFS inequality chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2017-03-01T16:59:43/embed.html\">IFS inequality chart</a> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/ifs-warnsf-biggest-squeeze-on-pay-for-70-years-autumn-statement\">IFS warns of biggest squeeze on pay for 70 years over Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThese troubling forecasts show millions of families across the country are teetering on a precipice, with 400,000 pensioners and over one million more children likely to fall into poverty and suffer the very real and awful consequences that brings if things do not change.<br></p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest drivers of the rise in child poverty is policy choices, which is why it is essential that the prime minister and chancellor use the upcoming budget to put in place measures to stop this happening. An excellent start would be to ensure families can keep more of their earnings under the universal credit.\u201d<br></p> <p>If benefit cuts are implemented as planned, the poorest 15% of the population are likely to have lower incomes in five years\u2019 time as a freeze in benefits and universal credit \u2013 which on average will be less than the benefits it replaces \u2013 take their toll.</p> <p>\u201cLooking forward, we expect the fall in inequality since the recession to be reversed,\u201d the IFS said. The thinktank pointed to lower working-age benefits, which mainly affect less well-off families, as one of the key reasons why the gap between the rich and poor is expected to rise.</p> <p>Economists have warned that household finances will come under increasing pressure this year as inflation rises but wage growth remains weak. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">The sharp fall in the value of the pound</a> since the Brexit vote is starting to feed through to the headline rate of inflation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/14/uk-inflation-rises-to-18-spurred-by-weak-pound-and-rising-fuel-costs\">rose to 1.8% in January, the highest level in more than two years</a>. It is expected to rise further in the coming months, hitting about 3% in early 2018. </p> <p>Meanwhile the latest official figures on wages showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/15/pay-growth-slows-record-employment-rate-tuc\">pay growth slowed unexpectedly to 2.6% in the final quarter of 2016</a>, despite record rates of employment.</p> <p>Responding to the IFS report, a spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cWe are taking action to support families with the costs of living by cutting taxes for millions of working people, doubling free childcare for nearly 400,000 working parents and introducing the \u201cnational living wage\u201d \u2013 a significant pay rise for the lowest earners. More people are now in work than ever before with living standards also forecast to rise over this parliament.\u201d <br></p> <p>Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the number of children living in UK households where no adult is working has fallen to its lowest level since recent records began two decades ago, at 10.7%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b07c9491f82e7dae77ddb476f1cd48f87e6c62b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b07c9491f82e7dae77ddb476f1cd48f87e6c62b3/0_0_2864_1719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damian Green.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damian Green said Conservative policies had given more parents the opportunity to find work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dinendra Haria/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cMore parents now have the opportunity to find work and enjoy the dignity and security of having a regular wage.</p> <p>\u201cWe will continue to build on this success as we roll out universal credit to all parts of the country \u2013 ensuring that it always pays to be in work.\u201d</p> <p>The IFS said average pensioner incomes are likely to rise twice as quickly as those for the rest of the population, if earnings growth projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) \u2013 the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster \u2013 prove correct. By 2021-22, average pensioner income is likely to be 24% higher than it was in 2007-08, the thinktank said.</p> <p>Pensioner incomes have benefited from real growth in the level of the state pension, people staying on in employment at older ages, and a change in the composition of pensioners, with the newly retiring tending to have larger private pension entitlements than previous cohorts of pensioners.</p> <p>Child poverty is projected to rise from 27.5% in 2014-15 to about 30% in 2021-22, returning to its pre-recession level. The IFS said the rise was explained by tax and benefit reforms planned for this parliament, particularly the cuts to working-age benefits,.</p> <p>Andrew Hood, an author of the report and a senior research economist at the IFS, said: \u201cWeak earnings growth combined with planned benefit cuts mean that the absolute poverty rate among children is projected to be roughly the same in 2021-22 as it was in 2007-08. In the decade before that, it fell by a third. Tax and benefit changes planned for this parliament explain all of the projected increase in absolute child poverty between 2014-15 and 2021-22.\u201d</p> <p>Pensioner poverty, however, is projected to fall from 13% in 2014-15 to 11% in 2021-22. <br></p> <p>Tom Waters, a research economist at the IFS, said the impact of the financial crisis would still be felt in the years ahead: \u201cEven if earnings do much better than expected over the next few years, the long shadow cast by the financial crisis will not have receded.\u201d</p> <p>The OBR will produce an updated set of forecasts for the economy and public finances to coincide with the budget on 8 March.</p>",
