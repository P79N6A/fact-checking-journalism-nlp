      "bodyText": "Next shareholders should not despair: their chief executive, Lord Wolfson, may be \u201cvery cautious\u201d about the year ahead but that represents only a modest downgrade on his normal mood in March. This time last year, he thought Next\u2019s pre-tax profits would be \u00a3730m-\u00a3770m. In the event, Wolfson unveiled \u00a3782m on Thursday \u2013 and that was achieved even with a mild weather-related warning last autumn. For all that, Wolfson is correct when he says prospective returns are low by Next\u2019s standards. The bottom of his profits range for the current year is \u00a3785m, or almost no growth. And the top end, \u00a3835m, would represent a 6.7% improvement, the weakest rate for four years. What\u2019s up? Tough comparatives, he says, but that\u2019s always the case for Next, plus some fashion collections that are \u201cnot as strong as they were at this point last year.\u201d Top marks for honesty, but the other ingredient may be one he didn\u2019t spell out \u2013 the sense that consumers aren\u2019t spending as freely as would have been expected after the plunge in petrol prices. In the medium-term, Next has nothing to worry about. The online business is growing overseas and there is a potentially lucrative adventure, Label, selling other people\u2019s brands. And the special dividends should keep flowing because the share price, even after a 4% fall, still sits well above Wolfson\u2019s disciplined limit for buy-backs. In fact, it\u2019s the rest of the high street that should be worried. A non-vintage year for Next suggests there will be disappointment elsewhere. Forecasting doubts Neil Woodford, the vastly experienced fund manager, makes an obvious but important point: if you make only small tweaks to the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s main economic assumptions, chancellor George Osborne\u2019s projection of a small budget surplus in 2018/19 evaporates and becomes a large deficit. Woodford suggests a dose of reality is required. Don\u2019t assume, as the OBR does, that inflation returns to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. It won\u2019t happen any time soon, thinks Woodford. He plugs 1% into his model and reckons even that figure may prove optimistic. He also notes that real GDP growth in the UK was 1.8% per annum between 2010 and 2014. That\u2019s the figure he uses, not the OBR\u2019s projection of 2.3% to 2.4%. The result: the deficit continues to reduce but at a much slower rate and does not produce a surplus. Indeed, the cumulative difference when projecting out to 2019/20 in \u00a3120bn, which is more than a rounding error. One could call it the law of small numbers \u2013 seemingly tiny differences in figures matter when the annual deficit starts at \u00a391bn. And when even the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist says the next move in interest rates could be a cut, not a rise, the only sensible response is to take all economic assumptions with a dose of salt. Sky\u2019s costly catch Sky\u2019s share price has risen 10% since it \u201coverpaid\u201d last month for its next set of Premier League rights, demonstrating that investors\u2019 greater fear was football being wiped from the screens. Chief executive Jeremy Darroch will feel vindicated in agreeing to pay the colossal sum of \u00a34.18bn over three years, about \u00a31bn more than the City expected. But the bill, which represents a \u00a3600m-a-season increase in Sky\u2019s Premier League costs, still has to be paid. So there was an air of inevitability about the price rises announced on Thursday\u2013 \u00a31 a month to \u00a347 for the sports-plus-basic package and \u00a33 to \u00a336 a month for the entertainment channels, where Sky has also been investing heavily. Is that enough to make viewers switch off? Probably not. Customer loyalty at Sky is the best it has been for a decade. But pricing power is not inexhaustible. With other content costs rising, analysts at Jefferies think Sky will struggle to increase its UK earnings before interest and tax through the next two Premier League cycles \u2013 in other words six years. Sky may confound that expectation, and Darroch can also look to the German and Italian businesses for growth. But Premier League football itself looks increasingly like a treadmill, and it\u2019s not obvious how Sky could ever jump off. Green speaks up Apologies to Lord Green. It was said here incorrectly on Tuesday that he had cancelled a speech the following day at St Michael\u2019s Cornhill church in London. In fact, the former chief executive and chairman of HSBC gave the speech, as we reported. It was another speech next week at Queen Mary University of London that had been cancelled.",

Channel 4 News has published further details of an interview obtained after the broadcaster confronted Green during a lecture on banking ethics at a City of London church on Wednesday night. Green, a Tory peer and ordained Church of England minister, argued that the bank he ran from 2003 to 2010 was one of the strongest in the country. \u201cHSBC was the company that was a tower of strength in the crisis. It never took taxpayer money. It continued to pay its taxes and its dividends. It was supporting the markets through difficult periods of 2007-08. Does that sound like being asleep? Plainly not.\u201d When the Guardian first published details of undeclared accounts and a revolving door of customers collecting bricks of cash from HSBC\u2019s Geneva branch, Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the public accounts committee, accused Green of either being \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d or of being involved in \u201cdodgy tax practice\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The giant corrugated white shed that dominates the quayside at Vlissingen in the Netherlands is just one of many dull metal boxes like it, dotted around the harbour city. Inside the vast hangar, shimmering under the fluorescent bulbs, are row after row of neatly stacked aluminum ingots. Mundane as they look, these huge storage sheds are behind a fierce row that has battered the reputations of Wall Street and industrial titans including Goldman Sachs, Glencore and JP Morgan Chase. The row has also reverberated through the City of London, sparking a revamp of the London Metal Exchange\u2019s (LME) rules that govern its controversial metals warehousing system. The LME has been under pressure since last year\u2019s investigation by a US Senate committee into the aluminium market that issued a damning report in November. Big industrial users of aluminium, such as Coca-Cola, MillerCoors and Rexam, the packaging giant, claim that a cadre of Wall Street banks, traders and producers of the metal have sucked as much as $6bn (\u00a34bn) a year from them by artificially inflating the price. \u201cThe market is effectively broken,\u201d said one industrial user of the metal. \u201cSince 2009, the physical delivery system has broken down.\u201d The price paid on top of the base price for physical delivery in Europe \u2013 the premium \u2013 has rocketed since 2010, the source noted.

But the length of time it takes users to get their metal out of storage has also rocketed, pushing up the premium. The premium peaked at $425 a ton in November, although it has fallen recently to about $305, after the LME\u2019s long overdue intervention. A fall in the premium is a move in the right direction for users, but they believe a lot more can be done; they think it would be closer to $180 a ton if the market was functioning efficiently. The metals market has been a hotbed of action recently, with price slumps and frequent takeover rumours. While copper rebounded from five-year lows in January, the price of iron ore has tumbled to less than a third of the value it commanded at the peak of the boom in 2011. The top three producers \u2013 BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Vale \u2013 have flooded the market with ore to drive other high-cost rivals out of business. Compared with these assets, aluminium has remained relatively stable. However, large users of the metal believe that by hoarding aluminium in two LME storage locations \u2013 Detroit and Vlissingen \u2013 the owners of these warehouses, mainly Goldman Sachs and Glencore, have been able to inflate the \u201call-in\u201d price. One component, the base price, is quoted on the LME and shaped by global supply and demand; but the other component, the delivery premium, has rocketed over the past five years as the queues for metal stored in Detroit and Vlissingen lengthened. According to LME rules, warehouse owners are obliged to load out a minimum of 3,000 tonnes of metal a day from each warehouse location. But the storage companies treat this as a maximum, slowing down the outflow of metal and helping maintain long queues. Getting your metal out of Vlissingen warehouses means joining a queue for nearly two years \u2013 586 days, to be precise. In Detroit it is worse, taking 610 days to deliver aluminium from the warehouse. One company \u2013 Metro International \u2013 dominates the storage units in Detroit. Until December, Goldman Sachs owned Metro. In Vlissingen it is a company owned by Glencore, Pacorini, that has a similarly tight grip on the LME supervised warehouses. Goldman and Glencore snapped up these businesses in 2010, at which time the queues to get metal from the sheds began to rise. Last year\u2019s Senate committee report noted that Goldman Sachs built up its physical aluminium stockpile from less than $100m in 2009 to more than $3bn in 2012.

Queues really started to build up in 2012 \u2013 two years after Goldman Sachs\u2019 purchase of Metro.\u201d Another aluminium industry source noted that since 2008 the price has fallen from around $3,000 a tonne, plus a $100 premium, to $1,800, plus a $300-$400 premium. Despite the fall in the overall price, big aluminium consumers want the LME to act more quickly to sort out the complex warehousing issue. The LME responded last month with a rule change that will slowly unwind the huge queues at Detroit and Vlissingen. It seeks to link the quantities of aluminium loaded into the LME\u2019s warehouse system with those that are loaded out. The minimum load-out will remain at 3,000 tonnes a day, but if companies load more in during one quarter, they will have to load-out the equivalent tonnage in the following three months. It has also just closed a consultation on plans to ban warehouses paying incentives to producers to keep their sheds fully stocked. \u201cThe change will eventually reduce the queue time from almost two years to about 50 days, but it will take two years for that to happen,\u201d a user said. \u201cThat\u2019s another $12bn [through an inflated premium] that will be redirected from consumers to producers.\u201d The LME said it would continue to work with the market to \u201cprevent new queues accumulating in the future\u201d. Sources from the aluminium industry dismissed users\u2019 claims, saying large consumers don\u2019t even buy metal from the warehouse because they deal directly with big producers, such as Alcoa, Rio Tinto/Alcan or Rusal. One said: \u201cThe users that complain the most don\u2019t even use the product that comes out of the warehouse.

The MPC\u2019s own mandate is crystal clear: deviations above and below the 2% inflation target are to be treated symmetrically.\u201d",

Ed Davey, energy and climate change secretary, said: \u201cBritain has some of the best tidal resources in the world \u2013 tidal lagoons could provide 8% of our electricity needs, replacing foreign fossil fuels with clean, reliable, home-grown electricity and creating fantastic economic opportunities.\u201d The energy department will start negotiations on a \u201cstrike price\u201d under the government\u2019s \u201ccontracts for difference\u201d mechanism, beginning at about \u00a3168 per megawatt-hour, although Poyry, an independent consultancy, believes it can be done for \u00a3150, falling to \u00a392 for a third lagoon. That compares with a strike price of \u00a392.50 for the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset. Greenpeace welcomed the move but said the UK\u2019s renewable industry needed a long-term strategy, \u201cnot just a belated wink to green voters\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "It will take time for improvements in the economy to filter through to the High Street, the chief executive of fashion chain Next warned yesterday, in a cautious assessment on the outlook for this year which sent the high-flying shares down 4%. Lord Wolfson - who is also a Tory peer and an economic adviser to Chancellor George Osborne - said all the economic indicators looked good, but they would not be immediately reflected in buoyant high street trade. \u201cAll the indicators look good to us, \u201che said, \u201con wages, inflation, employment, all the key variables that affect the amount of money people have to spend. I don\u2019t think there is an issue with the economy. \u201cReal incomes going up is good for retail. But it may not be good immediately. It\u2019s difficult at this point to say where people are going to spend.\u201d The retailer was the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest faller, even though it reported sales of more than \u00a34bn for the first time and delivered profits in line with expectations. Wolfson predicted that Next\u2019s sales would rise by between 1.5% and 5.5% in the year ahead, compared to about 7% last year. Growth would be harder to achieve, he said, because this year\u2019s performance was set against a very strong period of trading early last year when sales were boosted by a warm spring and popular collections. \u201cWe are now to back to a more normal situation. The vast majority of our ranges we are really happy with but we are not as happy as last year when we were over-performing.\u201d Wolfson admitted that growth at Next\u2019s home delivery service was slowing and its fashion collections were not as strong as last year. Wolfson said Next was facing increasing online competition from rival fashion retailers who have improved their websites and delivery services dramatically in recent years . \u201cWe started a long way out in front and I always said other people would catch up. It won\u2019t necessarily mean sales move backwards but our opportunities for growth will be constrained,\u201d he said. Analysts said sales at the main Next Directory catalogue and website, which have driven growth over the past few years, are likely to rise by just \u00a310m this year, compared to about \u00a381m last year . Wolfson said the majority of sales growth in the year ahead was likely to come from expanding Next\u2019s online business overseas and from its new Label website, which sells brands including Whistles, Joules,Adidas and Converse. Tony Shiret, an analyst at BESI, said there were early signs that Next Directory in the UK was reaching \u201cmaturity\u201d where it would find growth increasingly tough. \u201cWe believe that we are seeing a structural slowdown in Next\u2019s main growth engine,\u201d he said. Given the challenges facing Next, Wolfson said that prospective shareholder returns for the year ahead would be \u201cvery respectable by most standards\u201d but low compared with Next\u2019s historical performance. He predicted pre-tax profits would rise by between just 0.4% and 6.7% in the year ahead compared to 14% in the year to the end of January, when they hit \u00a3795m. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, described Wolfson\u2019s cautious outlook as the \u201csting in the tail\u201d of the company\u2019s results, which came out at the top end of expectations. Sales at Next rose 7.2% to just over \u00a34bn in the year to the end of January. Next\u2019s high street rival Marks and Spencer\u2019s is only slightly ahead in clothing sales - at \u00a34.1bn last year- but M&amp;S is far less profitable. Despite its cautious expectations for the future, Next will open a further 350,000sq ft of space in the year ahead, the same as last year. It is opening more department store style outlets out of town and extending existing outlets to combine clothing and homewares. Wolfson said he had taken a look at BHS\u2019s portfolio of stores, some of which have recently been put on the market and could be interested in \u201cone or two.\u201d \u201d",

He predicted pre-tax profits would rise by between just 0.4% and 6.7% in the year ahead compared to 14% in the year to the end of January, when they hit \u00a3795m.</p> <p>Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, described Wolfson\u2019s cautious outlook as the \u201csting in the tail\u201d of the company\u2019s results, which came out at the top end of expectations.</p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/next-plc/rns/results-for-the-year-ending-january-2015/201503190700218485H/\">Sales at Next rose 7.2% to just over \u00a34bn in the year to the end of January</a>. </p> <p>Next\u2019s high street rival Marks and Spencer\u2019s is only slightly ahead in clothing sales - at \u00a34.1bn last year- but M&amp;S is far less profitable.</p> <p>Despite its cautious expectations for the future, Next will open a further 350,000sq ft of space in the year ahead, the same as last year. It is opening more department store style outlets out of town and extending existing outlets to combine clothing and homewares. Wolfson said he had taken a look at BHS\u2019s portfolio of stores, some of which have recently been put on the market and could be interested in \u201cone or two.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p> \u201d<br></p> <p> </p>",

      "bodyText": "Negative gearing is a perennial hot topic in the housing affordability debate. But as we saw when Joe Hockey and Chris Bowen discussed the issue on Monday night\u2019s Q&amp;A, the debate is based on myth and entrenched bipartisanship. Rather than increase the supply of housing and keep rents down, negative gearing merely provides a tax break that encourages people to buy speculatively in the housing market \u2013 helping to spur house prices and thus reduce affordability. Negative gearing allows the owner of an investment property to deduct the net cost of owning the property \u2013 including interest payments \u2013 against their other income. So, if the amount an investor pays in interest and costs of upkeep of a rental property is greater than the income they receive in rent, then that loss is used to reduce their taxable income. As the cabinet papers of September 1987 noted, it is \u201ca generally recognised tax shelter\u201d, which is a polite way of saying a legal tax rort. The cabinet papers of that time are important because in July 1985 the Hawke government had ended the negative gearing, but in September 1987 it restored it. Those in favour of negative gearing often cite how when the Hawke government did away with it, rent prices shot up. On Monday night Hockey also used this excuse, suggesting: \u201cIf you abolish negative gearing on investment properties, there\u2019s a strong argument that rents would increase.\u201d He argued that when Bob Hawke actually did it in the 80s, there was \u201ca surge in rents\u201d. He concluded: \u201cIf you can see some evidence to say that you would not see any increase in rents if you abolish negative gearing there might be a more compelling case, but I don\u2019t see that.\u201d The Grattan Institute\u2019s John Daley, who was also on the panel, then interrupted to say: \u201cThe good news, treasurer, is there\u2019s lots of evidence already provided.\u201d Daley went on to explain that when negative gearing was abolished, rents across the country \u2013 other than in Sydney and Perth \u2013 didn\u2019t rise at all. The data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the 1987 cabinet papers support this. The annual growth of rents from 1982 to 1990 show that although rents did increase in Sydney and Perth during the period negative gearing was abolished, elsewhere there was no evidence that removing it had any impact: And the impact across the country of the real price increase of rent \u2013 where rent price increases are taken away from overall inflation \u2013 was even less pronounced. In Brisbane and Adelaide, rent prices actually increased by less than inflation during that period: The real reason for the previous increase in rents in Sydney and Perth was due to \u201clocal influences rather than tax measures dominate in metropolitan rental markets\u201d, as found in the 1987 cabinet papers. At the time, the big local influence on rental prices was vacancy rates. In Sydney and Perth vacancy rates before the removal of negative gearing had fallen sharply, and thus, not surprisingly, rent prices went up as people were desperate to find a place: In Adelaide and Brisbane vacancy rates were quite high and thus rent prices barely rose as renters had a large choice. But negative gearing alone isn\u2019t the only issue. In 1999, the Howard government changed the way capital gains was taxed \u2013 effectively halving it to offer a 50% discount. This made buying investment housing very attractive. Together with the negative gearing provision, it meant you could buy and run an investment property at a loss and claim that loss off your taxable income, then sell the property later for a profit. You would also pay only half the tax on that profit than on your other income. Pretty sweet. And Australians love it. They not only love to own rental property, they love to make a loss on it. Saul Eslake notes that in 1998-99 (the year before the changes to capital gains tax were made) about 11% of taxpayers owned a rental property and together made almost $700m in profit. By contrast, in 2011-12 1.89m taxpayers (or nearly 15%) received a rental income, but combined they lost $7.86bn. John Daley estimates this loss \u2013 which also reduces the taxable income of investors \u2013 costs the government around $5bn a year in forgone income tax revenue. And who are these investors? Last year the ABC\u2019s Michael Janda did some excellent research to bust the myth that it was \u201cmums and dads investors\u201d. The Reserve Bank uses data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. That survey found that in 2010 that the richest 20% of households were much more likely than other households to have an investment property loan: And since 2002 there has been a surge in investors within the richest 20%. In 2002 just 16% of the richest 20% of households had an investment loan, by 2010 it was up to 23%: And, interestingly for those who see the issue as one of baby boomers versus the rest, the big surge in investment property ownership since 2002 has come from the households aged 25-34: It would seem wealthy young people are just in favour of the tax rort as older Australians. And it is a rort. It does not affect rents because it has little impact on the level of housing stock: 92% of investor housing loans are to buy established dwellings: So it is really just a subsidy for people who are speculating on the real estate market. Running their investment at a loss, they are ultimately betting on making a profit when they sell the property, then taking advantage of the capital gains tax discount. A look at rental prices over the past decade shows that rents have actually risen by more than the price of new dwellings purchased by owner occupiers: So why does negative gearing remain? Because of the 1.8m investors and the industries behind it. And while it is a rort, as we have seen, it\u2019s a rort that younger people want to take advantage of. Grandfathering the laws to keep negative gearing for current investors would just be a case of favouring current property owners over future ones. It would also see a drop in sales as current owners would hold on to their property for longer to take advantage of the laws. One way to phase out the negative gearing laws would be to do it over five or 10 years or, it would be even better to keep them, but change the capital gains tax rate back to its previous rate. But I can\u2019t see this happening. In 2013, the Rudd government suffered all kinds of media and industry criticism for closing the fringe benefit tax loophole which applies to \u201ccompany cars\u201d that are in reality driven purely for private use. Australians sure as heck love their cars, but they love the idea of a home even more \u2013 the scare campaign against lowering the capital gains tax would be pretty severe and loud. Laughably, in 1987, the Masters Builders Association suggested that negative gearing \u201cexerted a strong psychological influence on landlords and investors\u201d. Which I guess is a way of saying \u2013 don\u2019t bother with the evidence \u2013 go with \u201cthe vibe\u201d. And thus it remains. As Bowen said on Monday night: \u201cI don\u2019t think either side of politics is going to abolish negative gearing tomorrow.\u201d I think he\u2019s right, more\u2019s the pity.",

In 2002 just 16% of the richest 20% of households had an investment loan, by 2010 it was up to 23%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/VeMMi/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And, interestingly for those who see the issue as one of baby boomers versus the rest, the big surge in investment property ownership since 2002 has come from the households aged 25-34: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 6\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/cSRtN/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It would seem wealthy young people are just in favour of the tax rort as older Australians. And it is a rort. It does not affect rents because it has little impact on the level of housing stock: 92% of investor housing loans are to buy established dwellings:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 7\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/vsxrm/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So it is really just a subsidy for people who are speculating on the real estate market. Running their investment at a loss, they are ultimately betting on making a profit when they sell the property, then taking advantage of the capital gains tax discount.</p> <p>A look at rental prices over the past decade shows that rents have actually risen by more than the price of new dwellings purchased by owner occupiers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 8\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/dfZ9G/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So why does negative gearing remain? </p> <p>Because of the 1.8m investors and the industries behind it. </p> <p>And while it is a rort, as we have seen, it\u2019s a rort that younger people want to take advantage of. </p> <p>Grandfathering the laws to keep negative gearing for current investors would just be a case of favouring current property owners over future ones. It would also see a drop in sales as current owners would hold on to their property for longer to take advantage of the laws. </p> <p>One way to phase out the negative gearing laws would be to do it over five or 10 years or, it would be even better to keep them, but change the capital gains tax rate back to its previous rate.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t see this happening. </p> <p>In 2013, the Rudd government suffered all kinds of <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/jobs-to-go-as-car-fringe-benefits-tax-ends/story-fncynjr2-1226681612703\">media and industry criticism</a> for closing the fringe benefit tax loophole which applies to \u201ccompany cars\u201d that are in reality driven purely for private use. </p> <p>Australians sure as heck love their cars, but they love the idea of a home even more \u2013 the scare campaign against lowering the capital gains tax would be pretty severe and loud. </p> <p>Laughably, in 1987, the Masters Builders Association suggested that negative gearing \u201cexerted a strong psychological influence on landlords and investors\u201d. Which I guess is a way of saying \u2013 don\u2019t bother with the evidence \u2013 go with \u201cthe vibe\u201d. </p> <p>And thus it remains.</p> <p>As Bowen said on Monday night: \u201cI don\u2019t think either side of politics is going to abolish negative gearing tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>I think he\u2019s right, more\u2019s the pity. </p>",
