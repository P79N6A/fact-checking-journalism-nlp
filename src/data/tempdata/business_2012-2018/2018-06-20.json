Full year net sales were $606.9m compared with $903.2m a year ago, a decrease of 32.8%. Firearms sales alone were even harder hit, dropping more than 40%. The results followed an established trend set during the Trump era. Gun sales have tumbled as the threat of tighter gun laws have receded under the pro-gun lobby president, leaving the companies with too much inventory on their hands and falling revenues. Sales \u2013 and gun company share prices \u2013 hit record highs under Barack Obama, who tried, but failed, to bring in tighter gun laws. Following Obama\u2019s comments after a series of mass shootings gun owners stocked up ahead of a feared crackdown. \u201cFiscal 2018 was a year characterized by lower consumer demand for firearms, heightened levels of inventory in the consumer channel, and a host of aggressive, industry-wide promotions,\u201d said James Debney, American Outdoor Brands\u2019 chief executive officer. Despite the drop, investors reacted warmly to the results, pushing shares in American Outdoor up 5.8%. The company said it anticipated higher earnings toward the end of the year as it cleared out existing inventory and cut firearm production. In December, American Outdoor Brands reported that its profits had fallen 90% year over year, from $32m to just $3.2m. Sales fell 36%. Last October, Sturm Ruger, the US\u2019s largest firearm manufacturer, announced its quarterly revenues had fallen 35%. Both companies will report their latest results shortly but neither is expected to announce a dramatic increase in sales.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The tax cut debate, as expected, has led to an absolute mountain of manure designed to mislead about who is going to benefit. Data on personal incomes out this week from the ABS drawing on the 2015-16 ATO tax statistics once again how delivers a nice shot of reality to the debate. The biggest beneficiaries of the tax cuts are high-income earners, with median-incomes earners \u2013 especially women \u2013 largely ignored. The government would have you believe the main beneficiaries of the tax cuts are true-blue, dinky-die, aspirational Aussie battlers, while the opposition would have you think it is merchant bankers from Vaucluse. As I have previously related, certainly merchant bankers and their ilk are the ones who are going to benefit the most. While stage one of the tax cuts \u2013 lifting the low-income tax offset \u2013 benefits low- and median-income earners, stages two and especially three are focused mainly on benefiting those who earn more than $90,000 and, even more so, those who earn more than $120,000. The government has now sought to encompass those within that income as those who will earn more than $90,000 by July 2024 with the proposal to axe the second highest tax bracket, which is proposed to start at that level of income. Using this measure allows the government to talk about people earning $75,000, because if we use the government\u2019s (ludicrous) projections of wages growing by 3.5% after 2020-21, by 2024 such people will be earning more than $90,000. Now certainly someone on $75,000 sounds more \u201caverage\u201d, and indeed it is lower than the average annual full-time earnings of $81,531 (though still above the average full-time earnings for women of $73,268). But it remains 21% higher than the average annual earnings for all workers of $61,968. But where does it sit in relation to most workers? For that we need to look at the median income, and here the data out from the ABS this week gives us some insight. Using the latest ATO tax statistics the ABS concludes that the median income for employees in 2015-16 was $51,319, with the median for men at $60,999 and for women at $43,177: But the ABS were able to break down the data further \u2013 by location, age, gender and occupation. No state or metropolitan area reaches the $75,000 median income \u2013 the ACT and greater Darwin have the highest and the non-Adelaide parts of South Australia have the lowest median of $41,778: That\u2019s not to say some areas don\u2019t have a median income above $75,000. Out of nearly 2,200 suburbs with more than 500 residents, a total of 20 had median incomes higher than $75,000. The good news is the data suggests there is no correlation between wealthy areas and more inequality \u2013 if anything, the more wealthier a suburb, the lower the inequality (although the relationship is very weak): When we break down the data by age and gender, the treasurer will be happy to know that there are two groups who have a median income above $75,000 \u2013 men aged 35 to 44 and men aged 45 to 54. No other group reaches that level, and the median income for women at any age groups doesn\u2019t come within cooee: Interestingly the growth in income over the five years to 2015-16 is very clearly weighted towards older groups. When we break the data down by occupation again we find two groups who can proudly be part of the $75,000 and above median income group \u2013 male managers, and male professionals: Once again no occupation grouping for women sees a median income anywhere near $75,000. And when we break down the occupations by age we see that once again it is a pretty niche group who can claim that $75,000 is median income \u2013 managers and professionals aged 35-64: And it is within this grouping that comes one of the more bizarre examples being used this week to advocate the tax cuts \u2013 that of school principals. During Monday\u2019s question time, in response to jibes about the tax cuts benefitting \u201cbankers from Vaucluse\u201d the prime minister responded that \u201cthere will be many, many occupations \u2013 school principals or police superintendents, which are not normally regarded as being part of the millionaire, banker class of Vaucluse \u2013 that will be earning an income that gets up towards that $200,000 mark\u201d. Now the school principal is an odd occupation to pick as being somehow representative of ordinary Australians. They are not even representative of those who work in schools \u2013 making up only around 3.5% of all teachers in primary and secondary schools. And they earn a hell of a lot of money compared to the rest. The average income in 2015-16 of a school principal was $115,066 compared to $72,398 for secondary school teachers and $64,559 for primary school ones, and they are also incidentally more likely to be claiming a franked dividend and negative gearing a property: In 2015-16, 85% of school principals earned over $80,000 compared to just 31% of primary school teachers and a mere 21% of the overall income earning population: By Tuesday the prime minister had made it more specific. In boasting about his plan to lift the highest tax bracket from $180,000 to $200,000 and abolishing the second highest tax bracket completely, he cited a school principal in Tasmania. Tasmanian principals in 2015-16 had a median taxable income of $108,982, which would have them earning more than 85% of Australians. Hardly the type lacking for aspiration I would suggest. But even this principal is not going to be worrying about the $180,000 anytime soon, let alone as Malcolm Turnbull suggested \u201cearning an income that gets up towards that $200,000 mark.\u201d They will only reach the $180,000 mark (using again the government\u2019s own ludicrous predictions for wages growth) in 2031-32. So why not use the example of a Tasmanian school teacher? After all, with a median income of $65,548 they are a bit above average, but not too much. Well, they only get to $120,000 in 2034-35 and to the magical $180,000 in 2046-47. By which time I suspect they might be somewhat drained of their aspiration: All the data, whether using census figures or taxation statistics, makes it clear who will benefit from the second and third stages of the government\u2019s tax cuts \u2013 it is people earning well above average and median incomes, and no amount of misdirection by the prime minister or treasurer can hide that fact. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The prospect of a trade war between the US and China has put markets under pressure this week, and although there was some recovery today, it was by no means convincing. As well as continuing uncertainty over the effect of the proposed tariffs, oil prices were volatile ahead of this week\u2019s Opec meeting. Meanwhile the pound edged a little higher after the UK government won a key Brexit vote. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 23.55 points or 0.31% at 7627.40 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.14% to 12,695.16 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.34% at 5372.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.16% to 22,120.58 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.34% to 9788.9 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 10 points or 0.05%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It\u2019s been a pretty volatile day for stock markets, as well as crude. And the pound has not been left out. From a low of $1.3149 against the dollar it hit a high of $1.3215 after the UK government won a key Brexit vote. It is currently at $1.3206, up 0.21%. Our politics live blog has all the latest details on the government\u2019s narrow success in seeing off a potential rebellion: Oil prices are edging higher ahead of the key Opec meeting which begins on Thursday and following a bigger than expected fall in US crude stocks. The oil producers are expected to agree to increase output but the key question is by how much. Meanwhile evidence of rising demand came from the weekly US figures, which saw a 5.9m barrel decline, the biggest drop since mid-January. On the other hand there was a 3.3m barrel rise in gasoline stocks compared to expectations of a 1m fall. Brent is currently up 0.19% at $75.22 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude oil is also in focus, with a whole raft of comments coming from OPEC member states ahead of Friday\u2019s big production decision. Despite an initial rebuttal of a production increase proposed by Russia (via Saudi Arabia), we are seeing a gradual shift in tone which will likely see some form of rise in output come Friday. For markets, the line in the sand seems to be the 1 million barrels a day level. Anything less than that will be seen as a compromise given the Saudi target is closer to 1.5 million barrels a day. We have seen the biggest drawdown in US crude inventories since January, but the impact has been offset by a rise in gasoline supply. Here\u2019s our first take on the David Drumm sentencing: Back with the Anglo Irish case and former chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to eight years in jail for his part in the fraud, but will serve six with mitigating circumstances taken into account. Investor enthusiasm appears to be waning, with markets coming off their best levels. Connor Campbell, market analyst at Spreadex, said: The Dow Jones, which at one point looked like it was going to reclaim 150 points, ended up starting the US session flat, the wrong side of 24700. There was little for the index to really work with on Wednesday, beyond the ever-looming threat of a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The Eurozone, which started the week poorly and then went downhill from there, saw its initial tame recovery gradually chipped away at until nothing was left. That means the DAX is back struggling to keep its head above 12700, while the CAC tumbled below 5400 after switching from a 0.3% rise to a 0.2% loss. Only the FTSE remained in the green with any real substance, and even then its 0.6% increase was half of the growth posted at lunchtime. Though the UK index broadly just followed the direction of trading from around the Western world, sterling\u2019s reversal of its initial losses also helped erase some of the FTSE\u2019s gains. The pound rose 0.1% against the dollar and the euro \u2013 granted, not a lot in the context of its recent performance \u2013 as the government appeared to come to a compromise over the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 issue, but couldn\u2019t gain any more momentum thanks to Thursday\u2019s impending Bank of England meeting. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has been speaking about the trade dispute with China. He says President Trump\u2019s strategy is to make it clear to China that continuing on its current path would be more painful that changing its behaviour. Back with the bids for 21st Century Fox, and Neil Wilson at Markets.com says the market is now waiting for Comcast\u2019s next move after Disney increased its offer: As was expected, cash was added to the all-share offer as a sweetener and the deal is now worth $38 a share, up from its previous $28 offer that was worth c$55bn. This beats Comcast\u2019s $35 all-cash, $65bn bid but we must assume that Comcast is ready to come back with an even stronger offer. This offer from Disney is probably a little bit stronger than expected and [Disney\u2019s] Iger will be looking to kill off Comcast\u2019s bid once and for all. However, the rationale for Comcast remains the same, the question is only how much debt it can afford to carry. If it gets its way total debt would rise to $170bn according to Moody\u2019s, with just $6bn in cash on its books. Disney will also take on Fox\u2019s $14bn debts, giving this bid an enterprise value of more than $85bn. Debt is a concern for investors here and points to market-top behaviour. The amount of debt both companies are prepared to assume is arguably a worry, but it\u2019s a case of innovate or die in the face of competition. It\u2019s a sign of just how desperately these two legacy media groups want the assets of Fox. In their attempt to contend with cord cutters like Netflix they are risking leveraging themselves up to a degree that makes them susceptible should the current benign market conditions deteriorate. Sky shares are trading up 3% today at \u00a313.82 on the news but they could go higher if Comcast really goes big. Even it doesn\u2019t have the appetite for all of Fox it could settle to swoop for Sky only and bag those important European subscription revs. US markets have joined in the generally positive mood after the week\u2019s sell-offs as trade tensions between the US and China escalated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.325 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better. But General Electric shares are down after the group was pushed out of the 30 share Dow after more than a century. GE, one of the original members of the Dow, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance. Back with trade disputes, and the European Union has confirmed it will begin charging import duties of 25% on a range of US products on Friday. The move is in retaliation to the US tariffs imposed on EU steel and aluminium. The EU tariffs will be placed on \u20ac2.8bn worth of goods, from Harley Davidson motor bikes to bourbon and peanuts. Over in the US, and the country\u2019s current account deficit widened in the first quarter, but by less than forecast. Reuters reports: The Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, widened by $8.0 billion to $124.1 billion, or 2.5 percent of national economic output, in the first three months of the year. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the current account deficit to widen to $129.0 billion from the previously reported $128.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The figures also showed that US companies brought back cash from overseas after a December 2017 tax change. Companies paid out dividends of around $305bn from foreign receipts. Newsflash: The takeover battle over Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox group has taken another twist. Disney has raised its offer for most of 21CF to $38bn per share, up from a previous offer of $28 per share. That takes the value of the offer up to around $70bn, from $52bn previously. Disney has also tweaked its offer to include a cash component - previously it was only offering shares. It beats Comcast\u2019s rival all-cash offer of $35 per share, and seemingly puts Disney back in poll position. Over in Dublin, one of Ireland\u2019s fallen bank bosses is being sentenced over his role in the financial crisis. David Drumm, the former CEO of Anglo Irish bank, faces a prison term after being found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting earlier this year. The case relating to banking transactions he was involved in at the height of 2008 financial crisis. By circulating deposits between Anglo and Irish Life &amp; Permanent (IL&amp;P), the bank created the impression that its deposits were \u20ac7.2bn larger than was actually the case. Tom Lyons, deputy editor of The Sunday Business Post, is tweeting from the court room. He reports that Drumm\u2019s team is defending his actions, while also recognising that a custodial sentence is on the cards.... Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says investors should be cautious about joining today\u2019s rally. He points out that the trade spat between China and the US could escalates again soon. Asian and European stocks rose today as markets attempted to shrug off trade war threats. While the improved risk appetite could elevate stock markets higher, the sustainability should be questioned as fears over trade tensions remain a key market theme. Global equity bears could transform the current rebound into a classical dead cat bounce if trade tensions between the United States and China continue to escalate. The US stock market is expected to rise when trading begins in a couple of hours, ending several days of losses. Yesterday the Dow lost 287 points, or 1.1%, wiping out its 2018 gains. The Bank of England could face a major shake-up if Labour wins the next election. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is unveiling a swathe of proposed reforms to Britain\u2019s central bank today. The headline-grabbing elements include opening an office in Birmingham, a shift away from its base at London\u2019s Threadneedle Street. The most intriguing element - setting the Bank a productivity target, alongside its current mandate to control inflation. These ideas aren\u2019t Labour policy yet, but they could be considered for its next manifesto: Chris Giles of the FT suggests the Bank could have some issues with a productivity target: Good news: UK factory orders have risen, helping manufacturers to boost their output. The CBI\u2019s latest healthcheck on the sector has found that manufacturing order books recovered in the last quarter, while the volume of output increased strongly. The CBI says: 33% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 20% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +13% 20% of firms said their export order books were above normal, and 11% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +9% 43% of businesses said the volume of output over the past three months was up, and 13% said it was down, giving a rounded balance of +29% Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, believes Britain\u2019s industrial sector may be picking up pace after a recent lull. \u201cThe recovery in orders and a return to bumper growth in production suggests the lull in manufacturing activity may be over. While risks to demand persist from Brexit and escalating global trade tensions, firms can work with the Government to nurture a pro-enterprise environment that helps UK growth to shift up a gear. UK housebuilder Berkeley has called the top of the London housing market. After some bumper years, Berkeley told shareholders that profits will drop by 30% in the 2018/19 financial year, as the sector returns to \u201cmore normal\u201d times. Chairman Tony Pidgley says that new housing starts in London have dropped by a third in the last two years (or since the EU referendum, basically). Pidgley blames Brexit uncertainty for the drop in activity: It is telling that some funders and builders are choosing to exit the market when faced with the degree of risk and regulation that now confronts development in the capital where macro and political uncertainty, including Brexit, are leading to this caution. This is a great shame as London is a fantastic world-class city with unique attributes that will last long beyond the current hiatus which is only exacerbating the well documented under-supply. Stocks are recovering because investors are snaffling up bargains after Tuesday\u2019s rout, says Ken Odeluga of City Index. He believes the People Bank of China\u2019s intervention overnight is reassuring the markets: European stocks are posting solid gains with similar demand building in Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq contracts. This follows chunks of buying interest in Asia-Pacific shares. It looked very much like bargain-motivated flows juiced by a window of benign currency conditions, particularly in Japan, Hong Kong, S. Korea and Australia where benchmarks all added around 1%. Chinese equities also enjoyed a bounce, though to a lesser extent, with precarious sentiment capping Shanghai and Shenzhen gains as investors read the PBoC stepping in as corroborating a sense of crisis. The central bank recommended a reserve ratio requirement cut\u2014essentially looser policy\u2014after fresh tariff threats. Elsewhere in the markets, cryptocurrency prices are falling after another digital coin exchange was hacked. The South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb says it lost 35bn won ($31.5m) worth of virtual coins to hackers. It\u2019s the second such breach in a week, highlighting the risks of investing in crypto (as coins are virtually anonymous, they can be almost impossible to recover). Here\u2019s the damage: Two hours into the trading day, and European markets are all comfortably higher. Shares are up across the board, as traders shake off some of their fears about a devastating trade war. Analysts at FXPro say: Markets are taking a breath right now and retracing some of the moves over the past number of sessions. Whether this turns into a broader rally or the selloff is resumed remains to be seen. Stock markets are higher after support was found in the European session yesterday and US and Asian traders built on the foundations of that support. Sterling has hit a new seven-month low this morning, as the UK government faces another crunch vote over Brexit. Parliament will vote on the EU withdrawal bill, the government\u2019s flagship piece of Brexit legislation, later today. And one group of MPs are refusing to drop their demand for a \u2018meaningful\u2019 vote in the scenario in which Britain can\u2019t agree a Brexit deal. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve insists that parliament must have a chance to protect the UK economy, in the event of a no-deal. Grieve\u2019s amendment has been been sent back to the Commons by the House of Lords, amid claims that Theresa May \u2018double-crossed\u2019 Grieve last week by promising to address his concerns, then pulling a u-turn. The vote could be close, if Grieve\u2019s band of backbench Conservative MPs hold firm. Some pro-Brexit Labour MPs could vote with the government, though, which would be a headache for opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn..... This uncertainty has knocked the pound down by 0.2% to $1.315, the lowest since November 2017. Those calming words from the People\u2019s Bank of China are helping markets recover from yesterday\u2019s rout. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped by 80 points, or 1%, to 7683 (partly helped by a weaker pound). Other European markets are also higher, with Germany up 0.4% and Spain gaining 1% following the rally in Asia overnight. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reckons investors are \u201ccalming their fears about the current US-China trade tariff dispute\u201d. That\u2019s partly because neither side has actually imposed tariffs yet -- just made lots of threats. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains why things might calm down: On the trade front, we\u2019re likely to see a two month \u2018hibernation\u2019 as the US works through the legal process for the next $200bn of tariffs and China awaits the US\u2019 formal response. The boss of Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has predicted that China and the US still step back from a devastating trade wars. Lloyd Blankfein says that Trump\u2019s threat to add tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports are a negotiating tactic: That\u2019s what you would do if it was a negotiating position, and you wanted to remind your counterparty just how much fire power you had to bring to the negotiation.\u201d Blankfein is hopeful that Washington and Beijing won\u2019t mutually destroy their economies. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a suicide pact on this...\u201cI suspect we\u2019re not going to cause the economies to collapse with Smoot-Hawley on steroids. The protectionist Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 imposed tariffs on more than 20,000 imported goods. It was meant to protect US workers after the Wall Street crash of 1929, but actually appears to have hurt economic growth and didn\u2019t prevent the Great Depression. China\u2019s stock market isn\u2019t the only one flirting with a bear market. After days of losses, the Philippines PSI index has fallen almost 20% from its recent peak. Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose more tariffs on China is dominating the newspapers across Asia today. The China Daily newspaper \u2013 often a good window into Beijing\u2019s thinking \u2013 has accuse the US of trying to hurt the Chinese economy. It says: \u201cFaced with this heightened intimidation from the U.S., China has no choice but to fight back with targeted and direct measures aimed at persuading the U.S. to back off, since it appears that any concessions it makes will not appease the Trump administration, which wants to suck the lifeblood from the Chinese economy.\u201d \u201cBeijing will have to ensure that Washington is aware that there will be heavy price to pay every action it strikes against China if it is to avoid being a victim of the Trump administration\u2019s growing blood lust.\u201d The Global Times also put the boot in, saying Donald Trump\u2019s administration was the world\u2019s biggest destabilising factor. A raging fever of nationalism rising in the world\u2019s sole super power sends an alarming signal. Nationalism is a challenge to globalization. Rising nationalism and protectionism could hinder the process of globalization and jeopardize the world order. The US often points an accusing finger at alleged economic nationalism of other countries including China, but now, the reality is that Trump\u2019s truculent nationalism is posing the biggest threat. And in Hong Kong, the Apple Daily newspaper produced quite a front page... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Could Donald Trump really trigger a trade war with China? With neither side backing down, the markets getting nervous after yesterday\u2019s selloff hit shares and commodities across the globe. Trump\u2019s threat to impose new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese exports has investors worried, with Beijing already vowing to retaliate. Overnight, China\u2019s top central banker urged people to remain strong and calm. People\u2019s Bank of China governor Yi Gang told the Shanghai Securities Journal that China\u2019s economy remained solid, and that there was no reason to panic. \u201cChina still has good economic fundamentals and resilient growth. The yuan is one of a few currencies that have appreciated against the US dollar this year. \u201cI\u2019m fully confident about the health of China\u2019s capital market based on the fundamentals.\u201d Yi also pledged that the PBOC would act to \u201cfend off systemic financial risks\u201d, and prepare for the danger of \u201cpotential external shocks\u201d and \u201cfend off systemic financial risks\u201d. Yi Gang\u2019s comments helped to stem another day of losses in China, where shares are on the brink of a bear market (down 20% from their peak). Other Asian equity markets also recovered a little, with Japan\u2019s Topix up 0.5% and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P 500 gaining 1.1%. European traders might also recover their poise today, after Tuesday\u2019s selloff. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors fear the consequences of a trade war: Global GDP could stand to be hit by 2% - 3% should the trade war continue and spread, to put this into context the Great Recession wiped out 6% of the global GDP, so this trade spat is by no means insignificant. For weeks the market has been relatively complacent that Trump\u2019s tough protectionist rhetoric were merely a negotiating tool; however, the realisation that the US President is willing to go ahead with his threats has sent a shiver through the markets. Trump\u2019s strategy appears to be to raise the stakes until China is forced to capitulate, by opening up its markets to American goods and addressing intellectual property theft concerns. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, the world economy could find itself on a rocky road. Also coming up today.... Top central bankers are gathered in Sintra, Portugal, for a conference organised by the European Central Bank. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda, and ECB president Mario Draghi will all speak. Plue, we get a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s factories and the latest oil inventory figures from America The agenda: From 9am BST: European Central Bank conference in Sintra, Portugal 11am BST: CBI industrial trends survey of UK factories 3.30pm BST: US weekly oil inventory figures",

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Crude oil is also in focus, with a whole raft of comments coming from OPEC member states ahead of Friday\u2019s big production decision. Despite an initial rebuttal of a production increase proposed by Russia (via Saudi Arabia), we are seeing a gradual shift in tone which will likely see some form of rise in output come Friday.</p> <p>For markets, the line in the sand seems to be the 1 million barrels a day level. Anything less than that will be seen as a compromise given the Saudi target is closer to 1.5 million barrels a day. We have seen the biggest drawdown in US crude inventories since January, but the impact has been offset by a rise in gasoline supply.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a72c3e4b06f2cac880075\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T15:29:23.616Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our first take on the David Drumm sentencing:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/20/david-drumm-former-chief-of-anglo-irish-bank-sentenced-to-eight-years-in-jail\">David Drumm, former chief of Anglo Irish Bank, sentenced to eight years in jail</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a7115e4b06f2cac880056\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T15:22:57.727Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/20/china-trump-trade-war-fears-grow-uk-factories-business-live?page=with:block-5b2a4196e4b06f2cac87fd7e#block-5b2a4196e4b06f2cac87fd7e\">the Anglo Irish case </a> and former chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to eight years in jail for his part in the fraud, but will serve six with mitigating circumstances taken into account. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a64d4e4b06f2cac87ff9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T14:30:44.506Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investor enthusiasm appears to be waning, with markets coming off their best levels.

There was little for the index to really work with on Wednesday, beyond the ever-looming threat of a full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. </p> <p>The Eurozone, which started the week poorly and then went downhill from there, saw its initial tame recovery gradually chipped away at until nothing was left. That means the DAX is back struggling to keep its head above 12700, while the CAC tumbled below 5400 after switching from a 0.3% rise to a 0.2% loss. </p> <p>Only the FTSE remained in the green with any real substance, and even then its 0.6% increase was half of the growth posted at lunchtime. Though the UK index broadly just followed the direction of trading from around the Western world, sterling\u2019s reversal of its initial losses also helped erase some of the FTSE\u2019s gains. The pound rose 0.1% against the dollar and the euro \u2013 granted, not a lot in the context of its recent performance \u2013 as the government appeared to come to a compromise over the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 issue, but couldn\u2019t gain any more momentum thanks to Thursday\u2019s impending Bank of England meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a6436e4b02fa070a1666e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T14:28:15.360Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has been speaking about the trade dispute with China.

This beats Comcast\u2019s $35 all-cash, $65bn bid but we must assume that Comcast is ready to come back with an even stronger offer.</p> <p>This offer from Disney is probably a little bit stronger than expected and [Disney\u2019s] Iger will be looking to kill off Comcast\u2019s bid once and for all. However, the rationale for Comcast remains the same, the question is only how much debt it can afford to carry. If it gets its way total debt would rise to $170bn according to Moody\u2019s, with just $6bn in cash on its books. Disney will also take on Fox\u2019s $14bn debts, giving this bid an enterprise value of more than $85bn. </p> <p>Debt is a concern for investors here and points to market-top behaviour. The amount of debt both companies are prepared to assume is arguably a worry, but it\u2019s a case of innovate or die in the face of competition. It\u2019s a sign of just how desperately these two legacy media groups want the assets of Fox. In their attempt to contend with cord cutters like Netflix they are risking leveraging themselves up to a degree that makes them susceptible should the current benign market conditions deteriorate. </p> <p>Sky shares are trading up 3% today at \u00a313.82 on the news but they could go higher if Comcast really goes big. Even it doesn\u2019t have the appetite for all of Fox it could settle to swoop for Sky only and bag those important European subscription revs.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2a5700e4b06f2cac87fea7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-20T13:35:01.055Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have joined in the generally positive mood after the week\u2019s sell-offs as trade tensions between the US and China escalated.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 80 points or 0.33%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.325 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better.</p> <p>But General Electric shares are down after the group was pushed out of the 30 share Dow after more than a century.

      "bodyText": "The former chief executive of a bank that played a pivotal role in Ireland\u2019s financial crash almost a decade ago has been jailed for six years. David Drumm, 51, the former chief of Anglo Irish Bank, was sentenced to six years in prison after the judge took into account mitigating factors, including five months he spent in a US jail awaiting extradition. Drumm was found guilty earlier this month of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting for his part in a \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a36.3bn) fraud conspiracy. He was convicted of working with two other senior executives at Anglo and the chief executive of a rival bank to give the misleading impression to shareholders that deposits in 2008 were \u20ac7.2bn larger than they were as the worldwide financial crisis began to bite. Judge Karen O\u2019Connor said the intention was to create a false and misleading impression, and Drumm was the driving force. Sitting at Dublin circuit criminal court, O\u2019Connor stressed that Drumm was not being jailed for \u201cthe financial crisis\u201d or the economic crisis that followed but instead \u201conly for the two specific offences for which he has been convicted\u201d. But, she said: \u201cThis offending was premeditated and planned, and in fact the evidence was that significant planning went into this fraud.\u201d The bank collapsed in 2009 after a run on its deposits and it was eventually bailed out by the state, leaving the taxpayer on the hook for \u20ac29bn. Denis Case, the former chief executive of rival bank Irish Life &amp;Permanent, Anglo\u2019s former finance director Willie McAteer and Anglo\u2019s former head of treasury John Bowe were convicted two years ago. They received sentences ranging from two to three-and-a-half years. Anglo Irish was the poster boy of the reckless lending that brought Ireland to its knees. It was known as the \u201cbuilders\u2019 bank\u201d providing loans that fuelled the Celtic Tiger property boom. Drumm claimed during his trial that although what he did was a \u201chuge error in judgment\u201d he had done it in plain sight of other senior banking executives and civil servants worried about contagion. His imprisonment came almost a decade after Ireland\u2019s ignominious bail out by the International Monetary Fund. The prosecution told the court ahead of sentencing that Drumm was \u201cthe driving force behind the initiatives\u201d to bloat deposits with temporary transfers from a friendly rival. His defence lawyer urged the judge to remember how \u201cchaotic\u201d the world was in 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US. \u201cThose transactions did not cause Anglo\u2019s collapse, it was a futile attempt to save the bank,\u201d said Brendan Grehan. He told the court that Drumm, who relocated to the US in 2009 but was extradited two years ago, was not entering any character references. His life had become \u201can open book\u201d since he was charged and he did not want any of his family or friends to become \u201ccollateral damage\u201d. The judge rejected his argument during the trial that Drumm was part of the \u201cgreen jersey agenda\u201d \u2013 a phrase used to suggest acting in the national interest \u2013 or had acted with the \u201cgreen jersey\u201d authorisation of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator, which encouraged the Irish banks to support each other during the crisis. She said there was \u201cno evidence in this case that the Central Bank or the Financial Regulator directed criminality\u201d. Grehan told the judge that his client was not acting for selfish gain, but insisted he was trying to save the bank, which at the time was \u201cfacing annihilation\u201d. He detailed Drumm\u2019s rise from \u201chumble beginnings\u201d as the fourth of eight children born to his truck-driver father and hairdresser mother. He left school at 16, joined Anglo aged 26 and by the age of 37 was chief executive.The bank ballooned in size during the Celtic Tiger years. He filed for bankruptcy after moving to Boston. In an excoriating ruling, the bankruptcy judge said Drumm was \u201cnot remotely credible\u201d, and his sworn statements to the court were \u201creplete with knowingly false statements, failures to disclose, efforts to misdirect and outright lies\u201d. A US bankruptcy trustee has since recovered \u00a36m from the sale of assets he owned or co-owned including a lakeside mansion in Cape Cod, a house in Massachusetts and a house in the exclusive Abington estate in Malahide, Co Dublin, where Boyzone\u2019s Ronan Keating was once a neighbour.",

      "bodyText": "The London-focused housebuilder Berkeley Group has announced record annual profits of nearly \u00a31bn, but warned profitswere likely to fall in the coming year by about a third as Brexit uncertainty weighs on the capital\u2019s housing market. The company, which builds luxury homes in London and the south-east, said a 15% jump in pre-tax profits to \u00a3934.9m in the year to 30 April could prove to be the peak as the market remained subdued. Profits rose last year despite a dip in sales, thanks to an increase in the average selling price of a Berkeley home, to \u00a3715,000 from \u00a3675,000 in the previous year. That is more than three times the national average of about \u00a3214,000 according to Nationwide building society. Berkeley sold 3,536 homes over the year, 369 fewer than a year earlier. Its shares fell 5% to \u00a339.26 on Wednesday after it said profit growth would not be sustained, as higher stamp duty on second homes, Brexit uncertainty, and tougher mortgage rules weighed on buyer appetite. \u201cThese results \u2026 represent a peak for Berkeley with profitability returning to more normal levels from 2018-19, when profits are anticipated to be around 30% lower,\u201d the company said. Berkeley said it was able to buy land in top locations in 2010-13, when it was in a cash-rich position compared with other companies. However, the benefit of that is coming to an end. The company\u2019s schemes include Kensington Row in west London, where apartments are \u00a31.6m to \u00a33.4m, and the Royal Arsenal Riverside development in Woolwich, south-east London, where flats range from \u00a3320,000 to \u00a31.7m. Annual house prices in London fell last year for the first time since 2009, as weak wage growth and Brexit uncertainty discouraged potential buyers. Tony Pidgley, Berkeley\u2019s founder and chair, said London was still a good place to buy a home. \u201cIt is telling that some funders and builders are choosing to exit the market when faced with the degree of risk and regulation that now confronts development in the capital where macro and political uncertainty, including Brexit, are leading to this caution,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a great shame as London is a fantastic world-class city with unique attributes that will last long beyond the current hiatus, which is only exacerbating the well-documented under-supply.\u201d Last year, Pidgley was awarded a total pay package of \u00a329m, after a sharp rise in the share price drove up the value of rewards received under a long-term incentive plan. However, Berkeley said a subsequent cap on payouts meant the maximum Pidgley could receive for the year to 30 April 2018 was \u00a38.2m. Berkeley said it expected to make at least \u00a33.4 bn of profits between May 2016 and May 2021, revised up from earlier guidance. Pidgley said the company was taking steps to address the challenging London market, including being more cautious about investment and by growing its business in Birmingham through St Joseph, the housebuilder\u2019s newest brand. About 75% of Berkeley sites are inside the M25. George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cBerkeley may have delivered higher than expected profits this year, but it seems investors are more concerned about the stability of the wider London market. \u201cPunitive stamp duty charges are dampening activity, while the UK\u2019s impending exit from the EU brings further uncertainty. Potential buyers are increasingly sitting on the sidelines waiting for more clarity on what the Brexit process will look like, while on the supply side there are questions as to whether there is going to be enough labour to build the homes the country needs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The bosses of Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s have been accused of using \u201cmickey mouse numbers\u201d by MPs, who also dismissed the two grocers\u2019 promise to continue running both brands separately after a merger as \u201cbaloney\u201d. In a bruising session on Wednesday morning, Neil Parish, chair of the parliamentary environment food and rural affairs committee, told Asda\u2019s chief executive Roger Burnley there was \u201cno logic to this deal other than a financial fix for both of you\u201d. \u201cWe are not children, you can\u2019t just come in here and give us a nursery rhyme,\u201d Parish said. He questioned the two companies\u2019 estimate that they together accounted for 25% of the grocery market. The two grocers\u2019 calculations include rivals such as Marks &amp; Spencer and B&amp;M Bargains, whereas data which only includes the main grocery chains suggests that Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda together account for more than 30% of the market. Burnley said Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s would continue to operate as \u201ctwo separate brands doing the right things for our customer base\u201d. He insisted that promised price cuts of 10% \u2013 on what he eventually admitted would be only a range of \u201cevery day essentials\u201d \u2013 would not be gained by forcing price cuts on suppliers. He said savings made across the business would be invested in the most competitive product areas. Burnley and Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, both said their plan was to focus on getting better terms from large suppliers by ensuring that the combined group paid the lower price if they were currently on different terms. They said those major suppliers would benefit from supplying one organisation rather than two and shoppers would get cheaper prices on items such as toilet rolls, detergent, tinned tomatoes and milk. They insisted that smaller suppliers, who account for only a small proportion of the retailers\u2019 turnover, would not be affected. Parish said the two companies would only be able to make savings and pass on promised price cuts for shoppers by cutting prices to all suppliers. \u201cAsda and you are playing us for fools. Money has to be saved somewhere,\u201d he said. Parish suggested they were likely to adopt Asda\u2019s way of operating, buying less from British farmers, and accused them of trying to cover up their true plans. He said the companies were also likely to reduce staff at head office further down the line. \u201cYou are going to run two separate things?\u2026 it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is baloney \u2026 Six months or even a year further down the road it is going to be one system.\u201d Burnley said: \u201cThere is a mood of optimism among suppliers. This is about a step change in our ability to offer customers what they want, better value and better prices.\u201d Parish insisted most suppliers were \u201cterrified\u201d and it had been \u201ca huge problem to get anyone to say anything\u201d about the deal because of that. He also questioned whether large suppliers would agree to the new terms Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s wanted. \u201cIt is not believable that big suppliers are all going to bow down \u2026 No they are not, because they are bigger than you,\u201d he said. Even if major suppliers do agree to lower prices he suggested they might fund this by putting pressure on smaller suppliers down the chain. Coupe denied the \u201cimplication that we are going to work everybody back to the lowest common denominator\u201d. \u201cI will be group chief executive of this company. I\u2019m very proud of my track record over decades in this industry raising standards well beyond anything you see in the world and [at the] leading edge of many things we do in the UK,\u201d he said. He also said standards would not slip at Sainsbury\u2019s following the merger. \u201cIf we do something that disenfranchises [shoppers] they will not shop with us,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Sir Terence Conran\u2019s restaurant group calls in administrators", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Terence Conran\u2019s restaurant group has called in administrators as the leisure and hospitality industry suffers from weak consumer demand and rising costs. The design and restaurant mogul\u2019s Prescott &amp; Conran business, which he set up with colleague Peter Prescott in 2006, had three remaining outlets all located in London: Lutyens in Fleet Street; Parabola at the Design Museum in Kensington and Albion in Clerkenwell. The restaurants shut on Wednesday morning with the loss of 72 jobs. Three other Prescott &amp; Conran venues in the capital \u2013 Les Deux Salons in Soho, 56 Redchurch St in Shoreditch, and Albion in Bankside \u2013 had closed in recent months. Conran, 86, launched high-end eateries such as Le Pont de la Tour, Bibendum and Coq d\u2019Argent, which he subsequently sold, as well as the furniture chain Habitat. The administrator of Prescott &amp; Conran, Stephen Clancy of Duff &amp; Phelps, said: \u201cThe restaurant trade is going through a period of sustained change off the back of changing consumer demand. As such, the group\u2019s directors made the difficult decision to exit underperforming restaurants.\u201d Conran\u2019s problems come at a tough time for restaurateurs as diners rein in spending amid a squeeze on spare cash. Meanwhile, costs are rising because of the increase in the legal minimum wage, business rate increases in London and higher prices on imported goods after the fall in the value of the pound. Restaurant chains including Carluccio\u2019s, Prezzo, which is the owner of the Chimichanga chain, Jamie\u2019s Italian and upmarket burger bar Byron have all been forced to close outlets in recent months due to a \u201ccasual dining crunch\u201d. One industry insider said upmarket establishments were also struggling as underlying sales were falling across the industry while costs were up. \u201cCasual dining is not the only sector in hospitality that is being affected. What tends to happen if people are going out less is they are more selective. They make a bigger effort to go to the first-choice restaurants or hotels and they can get busier. It\u2019s the second, third or fourth choices that suffer,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you are doing the same level of sales as last year, profits are down. It\u2019s only a matter of time before we start to see more closures.\u201d Clancy said Prescott &amp; Conran had been undertaking an operational review in recent months to improve profitability. That came after Prescott stepped back in January and Conran\u2019s son Ned took over the chairmanship. The administration does not include the Boundary Project \u2013 a bar, restaurant and hotel complex in a former warehouse inShoreditch, central London, which the Conran family will continue to own and operate.

      "bodyText": "Britain is facing a shortage of meat, salad and ready meals \u2013 as well as a World Cup beer drought \u2013 as stocks of carbon dioxide used by the food and drink industry run low. With northern Europe already battling a CO2 supply problem, three of the largest UK plants producing the gas have closed for maintenance, sparking panic among brewers, pub groups and food suppliers. Trade bodies said they held talks with the government to address the prospect of an interruption in the supply of fizzy drinks, beer and a wide range of foods that are kept fresh during storage and transit using CO2. The pub chain Wetherspoons and the Tottenham-based brewer Beavertown said the flow of beer and soft drinks could be cut off within days. Poultry producers said chicken processing plants, many of which use CO2 in the slaughter process, could also be affected. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that some drinks won\u2019t be available very soon,\u201d said a spokesperson for Wetherspoons, which has nearly 1,000 pubs across the UK. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the situation and working with suppliers to minimise any disruption. But the fact is that there is definitely going to be a problem that will affect not just Wetherspoons but all pub and bar operators.\u201d Most other pub chains are also expected to face disruption. The drought could take hold before the end of the World Cup, which concludes in mid-July. The gas is in short supply across Europe amid high summer demand for fizzy drinks and beer, coupled with shutdowns at ammonia and bioethanol plants, key sources of CO2. Beavertown said it had enough CO2 to last until next Tuesday and may have to halt production after that. The process requires CO2 to be pumped into cans and bottles to rid them of oxygen and keep the beer fresh. \u201cIt\u2019s come at absolutely the wrong time because it\u2019s the World Cup and the height of summer. People want to watch the football and have a pint, so demand increases,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThis will be right the way across the industry, from a micro-brewery to a larger brewer.\u201d He said Beavertown had limited supplies in reserve if CO2 supply did not resume. \u201cWe\u2019re almost always sold out but in this situation you want stock as backup. We could probably tide ourselves over for another week.\u201d Food supplies are also facing disruption because suppliers use CO2 to keep products fresh during storage and transit. The British Meat Processors\u2019 Association said it had asked the government to prioritise CO2 supplies to pork and poultry slaughterhouses because the gas is used in the most humane form of slaughter. Without increased supplies, farms could end up with a backlog of animals that cannot be slaughtered, a spokesperson said. Poultry producers said on Wednesday that 60% of chicken processing plants could be out of operation within days. Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said he was in urgent talks with government about securing supplies. He said if gas could not be secured then plants would have to consider reducing or stopping production or using temporary measures such as electrical stunning. With 90% of chicken and other poultry sold in British supermarkets produced domestically, halting production could have a swift impact on stocks in stores. \u201cThese are big plants processing more than 10,000 birds an hour. That would be a significant amount of food not being produced,\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cThe government is aware that there are reports of a CO2 shortage affecting the food and drink sector and that industry is working to find a solution. Whilst this is an issue for industry, the government is in contact with the relevant companies and trade associations, including those within the food and drink sector and main CO2 suppliers.\u201d The British Retail Consortium has written to retailers informing them that drinks and meat supplies could be affected. Camra, the organisation for devotees of cask ales, seized on the opportunity to urge drinkers to abandon artificially carbonated brews. \u201cBeer drinkers concerned about the supply of beer this summer can rest easy,\u201d said Tom Stainer, Camra\u2019s chief communications officer. \u201cThere are plenty of fantastic real ales, ciders and perries that will be completely unaffected by the impending CO2 shortage. \u201cReal ales are naturally carbonated by live yeast that is left in the bottle or cask, and are therefore \u2018living products\u2019 compared to keg beers, which artificially inject CO2 into the brew for carbonation. In addition, real ciders and perries are naturally still, making them a refreshing beverage choice in the summer heat.\u201d Camra members recently turned down a motion that would have led to it promoting the interests of products such as keg beer, which requires CO2.",

    "webTitle": "Middle income households faring best since the crash, report finds", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Middle-class households in the UK have seen their incomes grow more strongly than those at the top and bottom ends of the earnings scale during the years since the financial crash, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Between 2012 and 2017, the average income increased by 8% after taking into account inflation. For those in the bottom 10% of earners and those in the top 10%, incomes increased by just 4%, as those at the bottom were hit by benefit cuts and those at the top by tax rises and sluggish salary growth. \u201cIn the first five years of the recovery, incomes increased fastest around the middle of the income distribution,\u201d the leading tax and spending thinktank said. However, the institute said in its annual report on UK living standards that the swelling ranks of pensioners on or near the middle income band had helped drive up the median average, offsetting those of working age who have suffered from falling real wages. Pensioners, many of them enjoying generous occupational pension payouts, have increasingly joined the ranks of middle income earners over the last decade. The state pension, safeguarded by the government\u2019s triple lock, also increased steeply in the first years of the recovery, said the report, which is funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation anti-poverty charity. In contrast, once inflation is taken into account, wages remain 2% to 3% below where they were in 2007. Overall, income inequality has changed little since the financial crash despite steep cuts to in-work benefits since 2012 that have hit low income households hardest. But inequality has grown within groups, the IFS said. So within the top 10%, the highest earning 1% fared the best, increasing their share of total income from 5.7% in 1990 to 7.8% in 2016\u201317. The gap between poor and better off pensioners has opened up while regional differences have increased, according to recent government figures that showed the average household income per head, once taxes and benefits are taken into account, is only \u00a312,232 in Nottingham, compared to \u00a358,816 in Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and Fulham in west London. The situation for middle income earners is expected to improve further relative to those on low incomes over the rest of the parliament as planned benefit cuts, especially to Universal Credit, take effect. The IFS said it was difficult to argue that the higher minimum wage had offset benefit cuts, saying it was \u201crather tenuous\u201d when the policy had often raised the incomes of second earners from middle income families and was therefore \u201cnot particularly well targeted at low-income households\u201d. The IFS said: \u201cOverall, income inequality is substantially higher than it was in the 1960s, but roughly unchanged from the 1990s. \u201cIf the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecasts are correct, inequality is likely to increase in the next few years.\u201d Professionals and others outside the top 1% had also seen reductions in pension tax relief that forced them to pay more tax on their pension saving, reducing their gains during the recovery. The IFS said that broadly stable income inequality since the 1990s was the result of two offsetting trends: \u201cThe top 1% have received an increasing share of total income, but inequality among the bottom 99% of the distribution has fallen somewhat \u2013 partly due to slow income growth towards the top since the recession.\u201d The report also highlighted the plight of people with longstanding mental health problems, who are twice as likely to be in poverty. Finding that as many as 40% of adults across Britain with a mental health problem are in relative poverty, the IFS said this compares to 18% for the rest of the population. About 1.3 million people said they had a longstanding problem with their mental health last year, up by about 250,000 from 2014. Tom Waters, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report, said as many as 88% of the healthy population are in paid work, compared to 70% with health issues, showing the risk of slipping into financial problems caused by falling out of work.",

      "bodyText": "Shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised fresh ideas from Labour for the UK economy and here they come, courtesy of economist Graham Turner\u2019s \u201cfinancing investment\u201d report. The headline-grabber is the proposal to give the Bank of England a target for generating growth in productivity, which certainly counts as original. But there\u2019s another proposal \u2013 an old one \u2013 that ought to be dropped as out-of-date, expensive and risky. It\u2019s the idea of \u201cusing publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland to concentrate on delivering SME lending across the country\u201d. Such a plan was a realistic option in 2008 when the last Labour government rescued RBS by taking a 83% stake during the banking crisis. Full 100% control might have been wiser in hindsight. But events have moved on. After the Treasury\u2019s sale of a 7.7% chunk of shares a fortnight ago, RBS is only 62.4%-owned by the state. If chancellor Philip Hammond gets his way, RBS will be substantially in private hands before the next election, assuming the poll happens in 2022. McDonnell may oppose Hammond\u2019s sell-down but he can\u2019t ignore its existence. So what\u2019s the idea? To nationalise RBS in its entirety, however low the state\u2019s stake has fallen? Even at the current level of ownership, the outlay at today\u2019s share price to get full control would be \u00a311.5bn, which is serious money. And how is the lot of SMEs \u2013 small and medium-sized enterprises \u2013 supposed to improve? If the answer is to force RBS to adopt looser lending standards than its commercial competitors, the long-term risks to the public purse are obvious. And, given that RBS is the biggest or second biggest lender to SMEs in nine out of 11 regions of the UK, there is a danger of distorting the market. Other banks might retreat if a large state-owned rival sets its lending taps to maximum. None of which is to deny that promoting easier access to finance for SMEs is a fine ambition. It\u2019s just that better competition, and more new entrants, is more likely to be effective. Start by embracing the fintech, or financial technology, revolution and find policies to encourage the new breed of specialist and peer-to-peer lenders. Such an approach would be genuinely new, which you\u2019d think would appeal to a Labour leadership keen to escape the charge of 1970s-style statism. Fully nationalising RBS, and imposing lending targets, is a dead end. Debenhams may be fine in the long-term, but it\u2019s got to get there first In its new year profits warning, Debenhams reckoned it would make \u00a355m-\u00a365m of pretax profit this year. That became a shade over \u00a350m-ish in April\u2019s update. Now shareholders are told \u00a335m-\u00a340m is on the cards. Faith in chief executive Sergio Bucher\u2019s turnaround plan may also be shrinking. Five years ago, Debenhams was making \u00a3139m. The latest warning was blamed on weak markets and \u201cincreased competitor discounting,\u201d meaning the panic at House of Fraser. No short-term relief can be expected on that front. Debenhams may enjoy a boost when HoF actually closes half its stores but the process of getting to that point is likely to involve yet more discounting. In the meantime, Debenhams may be planning a sale of its own. The \u201cnon-core\u201d assets are under review and the most notable loose piece is Magasin du Nord, a six-strong chain of department stores in Denmark that is worth \u00a3162m according to broker Investec. If Bucher gets an offer at that level, he should probably take it and make a dent in Debs\u2019 borrowings of \u00a3320m. The group keeps saying the debt burden isn\u2019t a problem, which is correct if you look at the headroom within overall facilities of \u00a3520m. But the relevant measure now is covenants, which start to bite if profits fall to the \u00a320m mark. Back in January, that prospect still looked distant \u2013 less so now. One wishes Bucher luck since his attempt to invigorate Debs with virtuous brand-building was admirable in its way. But it was always a long-term strategy, and Debs\u2019 marketplace is crumbling in the short-term. The charmed life of KPMG and the big four \u201cThe big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly,\u201d says Stephen Haddrill, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, with KPMG singled out for strongest criticism. After such a damning verdict, you might expect investors to demand that companies find new auditors outside the big four. That won\u2019t happen, of course, since very few FTSE 350 businesses dare to step outside the golden circle of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. It is yet another reason why the entire auditing industry should be packed off to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consequences of failing on the job, in terms of competitive threat, seem to be roughly zero.",

      "bodyText": "A leading City figure whose former role involved governing the Square Mile has said Brexit could result in the loss of 75,000 jobs and up to \u00a310bn in annual tax revenue. Sir Mark Boleat, who was chairman of the City of London Corporation until last year, said a seepage of jobs from the capital was already underway and that the political rows over a deal or no-deal outcome was now \u201cirrelevant\u201d to City chief executives. Banks including JP Morgan, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC and Goldman Sachs have already established subsidiaries in other EU countries, or moved part of their business because EU law requires them to be legally compliant from the day the UK leaves. \u201cIt is no longer contingency planning. If you are running a bank it is non-negotiable. The regulators won\u2019t allow it,\u201d he said. In an interview with the Guardian before a keynote speech on Wednesday at the Cass Business School in London, Boleat said the City would not die as the financial capital of Europe but would be damaged by Brexit. \u201cThese moves are bad for London, but they are also bad for the EU because they will make financial markets less efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cFinancial services will be fine, but I would say if the City has 80% of international business now, in future it will have maybe 60%.\u201d Boleat said Brexit has prompted expensive and unwelcome processes and the damage would be seen over the decade to come. \u201cThis is a 10-year operation. In the short term it won\u2019t be noticeable in terms of staff. Banks won\u2019t be putting out press releases saying they are moving some of their operations because of Brexit because they don\u2019t want the publicity. They are just getting on with it. \u201cMoving costs millions. Banks have had teams of 100 working on Brexit. It is an expensive process. You have to identify which city to go to, applying for a [banking] licence costs millions, then you have to find the IT staff, find accommodation.\u201d He also believes the government is in such disarray that the Brexit deal will be pushed back to December, leaving business planning elsewhere perilously close to exiting the EU. In his address, Boleat will say he does not think financial services will get a special passporting deal to allow them to continue pan-European services from London and that banks are already past that moment of truth, whatever politicians think. \u201cThose who suggested that some business would move were accused of scaremongering,\u201d he will say before listing 15 major banks and financial services who have already set up on the continent or Dublin. He will quote a report by the Oliver Wyman consultancy that says if the UK strikes a deal giving full market access, the impact on the City would be modest, the equivalent of 3,000-4,000 jobs and a loss of \u00a3500m in tax a year to the Exchequer. \u201cAt the other end of the spectrum if the UK had no special status with the EU, now the most likely option, the industry would lost \u00a318bn a year in revenue which would put 31,000 to 35,000 jobs at risk along with \u00a33.5bn to \u00a35bn in tax revenue.\u201d Add the knock-on effect for related industries and the loss of entire business units, there is an estimated further losses of \u00a314bn to \u00a318bn in revenue and 34,000 to 40,000 jobs and \u00a35bn in tax. Asked whether the government was aware of the daily bleed of financial services to the rest of the EU, Boleat said: \u201cNot enough, that\u2019s the worry. It needs business to talk to MPs, not to give their view on Brexit, but to explain to them \u2018this is what I am having to do because of Brexit\u2019. This is not scaremongering, this is reality.\u201d",

They are just getting on with it. </p> <p>\u201cMoving costs millions. Banks have had teams of 100 working on Brexit. It is an expensive process. You have to identify which city to go to, applying for a [banking] licence costs millions, then you have to find the IT staff, find accommodation.\u201d</p> <p>He also believes the government is in such disarray that the Brexit deal will be pushed back to December, leaving business planning elsewhere perilously close to exiting the EU.</p> <p>In his address, Boleat will say he does not think financial services will get a special <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/authorisations/passporting\">passporting</a> deal to allow them to continue pan-European services from London and that banks are already past that moment of truth, whatever politicians think.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThose who suggested that some business would move were accused of scaremongering,\u201d he will say before listing 15 major banks and financial services who have already set up on the continent or Dublin. </p> <p>He will quote a report by the Oliver Wyman consultancy that says if the UK strikes a deal giving full market access, the impact on the City would be modest, the equivalent of 3,000-4,000 jobs and a loss of \u00a3500m in tax a year to the Exchequer. </p> <p>\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum if the UK had no special status with the EU, now the most likely option, the industry would lost \u00a318bn a year in revenue which would put 31,000 to 35,000 jobs at risk along with \u00a33.5bn to \u00a35bn in tax revenue.\u201d</p> <p>Add the knock-on effect for related industries and the loss of entire business units, there is an estimated further losses of \u00a314bn to \u00a318bn in revenue and 34,000 to 40,000 jobs and \u00a35bn in tax.</p> <p>Asked whether the government was aware of the daily bleed of financial services to the rest of the EU, Boleat said: \u201cNot enough, that\u2019s the worry. It needs business to talk to MPs, not to give their view on Brexit, but to explain to them \u2018this is what I am having to do because of Brexit\u2019. This is not scaremongering, this is reality.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The trade dispute between the US and China escalated on Tuesday, with a senior Trump official accusing China of \u201ctheft\u201d and Beijing accusing the US of blackmail. The news roiled global stock markets as investors feared that escalating tensions could trigger an international trade war. Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional $200bn in levies on Chinese goods on Monday evening, days after the US announced $50bn in tariffs aimed at punishing what the US administration sees as unfair trade practices. China has already said it will retaliate for last week\u2019s move and said it would escalate its response if further tariffs were imposed. In a call with reporters Peter Navarro, White House trade adviser and a longtime critic of China\u2019s trade practices, said China had had numerous opportunities to address Washington\u2019s concerns but had failed to do so. \u201cSince China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001, the working men and women of America have watched as more than 70,000 factories and millions of manufacturing jobs have moved offshore,\u201d said Navarro. He called Trump\u2019s plans\u2019 \u201ccourageous\u201d and \u201cvisionary\u201d and said they were aimed at halting China\u2019s plans to dominate the hi-tech industries of the future \u2013 a plan, known as China 2025, that Navarro said that would mean America \u201cwill have no economic future\u201d. The US will issue a report on China later Tuesday. Navarro said the report would document how China seeks to \u201cacquire the crown jewels of American technology\u201d through means including \u201cphysical theft and cyber theft\u201d and the acquisition of US technology by entities backed by state-backed funds. His comments came as China\u2019s commerce ministry said Beijing will fight back with \u201cqualitative\u201d and \u201cquantitative\u201d measures if the United States publishes an additional list of tariffs on Chinese goods. \u201cSuch a practice of extreme pressure and blackmailing deviates from the consensus reached by both sides on multiple occasions,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe United States has initiated a trade war and violated market regulations, and is harming the interests of not just the people of China and the US, but of the world.\u201d Monday night\u2019s move sent global stock markets sharply lower and the Dow followed suit, dropping 400 points in early trading and closing 237 points down, a fall that wiped out all of this year\u2019s gains. Some of the US\u2019s biggest exporters were among those most affected. Boeing dropped 3% and construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar shed 2.7%. Tech companies, too, felt the pinch with Apple down 1.5%. US industries from agriculture to technology have expressed concern about the impact of the dispute on their businesses. Navarro said China had far more to lose than the US and its \u201ceconomic aggression\u201d would not be tolerated. Navarro said he understood concerns about the impact of the dispute but that the tariffs would have \u201crelatively small effects\u201d on two countries with economies as large as China and the US. \u201cOur view is that these actions are necessary to defend this country and that they are ultimately bullish for corporate America, for the working men and women of America and for the global trading system for one simple reason: China\u2019s behaviour has created a huge structural imbalance in the world economy and led to a massive wealth transfer to China, not just from us but from Europe, Japan and wherever else China is able to acquire technology from.\u201d The spat between the two economic superpowers is already being felt in China. Chinese stocks recorded their steepest falls since the trade dispute started on Tuesday. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 3.8% to 2907.82, its lowest in nearly two years. The yuan fell to its lowest level against the dollar in five months. In Europe, all the major markets fell, with the FTSE closing down 0.4%, France\u2019s CAC down 1.1% and Germany\u2019s DAX down 1.2%. Oil prices too dipped as investors worried that the dispute would damage economic growth. \u201cTrump appears to be employing a similar tactic he used with North Korea, by blustering first in order to gain an advantage in negotiations,\u201d said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. \u201cThe problem is, such a tactic is unlikely to work with China.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 29 June 2018 to correct \u201cChina had far more to lose than China\u201d to \u201cChina had far more to lose than the US\u201d.",
