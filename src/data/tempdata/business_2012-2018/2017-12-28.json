      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 may have hit a new closing peak, supported by rising commodity prices, but it was a more mixed picture elsewhere. In rather muted trading ahead of the new year break, most European markets slipped back, while Wall Street is holding on to its early gains. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.03% at 7622.88 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.69% to 12,979.94 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.55% lower at 5339.42 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.36% to 22,120.95 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.71% at 10,093.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.26% to 799.05 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 35 points or 0.14%. Meanwhile bitcoin is down just over 9% at $13,941. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the last trading session of the year. Breaking news: The FTSE 100 has hit another record closing high - but only just. The index ended the last full trading day of the year (tomorrow traders knock off work at 12.30) up a magnificent 0.03% at 7622.88. Earlier, it also managed an intra-day high of 7633.55 before slipping back from that peak. Wall Street is still in positive territory, but European markets are drifting lower as we head to the close. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The final full session of the year has seen European markets drop slightly, with an absence of catalysts prompting a drift to the downside. London\u2019s ability to hold above 7600 should come as encouragement to UK investors, even with several heavyweights going ex-dividend today. However, stocks on the continent have continued their sideways pattern of the past two weeks, as they look ahead into a 2018 that will see the ECB cut back its monthly purchase levels and a host of political issues. However, as the big investors cut back on their European exposure, one of the big themes of this year, there will be plenty of opportunities for ordinary investors to pick up bargains and gain exposure to one of the healthier parts of the global economy, assuming they can stomach the potential volatility from various elections. Over with bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency is off its lows of the day but still down nearly 8% at $14,152. On the Chicago data, Jamie Satchi, economist at MNI Indicators, said: Sentiment among businesses started 2017 in good shape and only impressed more as the year progressed. December\u2019s result secured the MNI Chicago Business Barometer\u2019s first full year of expansion since 2014 and with new orders ending the quarter in fine shape there is every chance this form could be carried over into 2018. Some strong US data, in the shape of the Chicago purchasing managers index. The index has jumped from 63.9 in November to 67.6 in the final month of the year. This is far better than the decline to 62 which had been expected, and marks the highest level since March 2011. US markets are on the rise, helped by a weaker dollar and a rally in commodity prices, although trading is thin in the run up to the new year break. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 39 points or 0.15% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.14% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.21%. Just in: America\u2019s labour market remains strong, with just 245,000 people filing new claims for unemployment benefit last week. Although more than expected, it\u2019s still a low figure by historical standards. Bitcoin is on track to post its ninth daily fall in 12 days. Bitcoin has now clawed its way back over $14,000, but it\u2019s still down over 7% today since South Korea announced its clampdown (details here). Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says regulatory threats have triggered the selloff, but points out that bitcoin has suffered similar slumps before. He says: After forming a high of $16,416 this week, the cryptocurrency came under a selling pressure as traders showed their reaction to South Korea\u2019s news. The country is determined to curb the speculative market and it would take measures to stop and review various crypto-exchanges. The reality is that the market is way too overheated and no one wants the cryptocurrency popping on their door steps. However, this is surely not the first time that we have witnessed this kind of reaction in the Bitcoin price. Throughout this years, we have heard many similar messages (followed by actions) from China and yet Bitcoin made a high of $19,338 [earlier this month]. But.... Craig Erlam of Oanda suspects that anxiety over bitcoin\u2019s future may be rising..... Bitcoin is coming under selling pressure once again, with efforts by South Korean authorities to rein in speculation being blamed.... While this is likely a contributing factor, I wonder if given the pre-holiday drop, whether speculators have become more sensitive to negative news. We saw plenty of this in reverse on the way up, with positive news triggering significant rises and negative news being brushed aside. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we see prices heading back below $10,000 before they find their feet again. Readers might assume that shares in London are up because the pound is having one of its wobbles (because a falling pound boosts the profits of multinational companies listed in London). But actually, sterling is up 0.25% against the US dollar today, at $1.343. And during 2017 as a whole, the pound has gained over 8% against the greenback, having started the year at $1.235. The dollar is losing ground against most currencies today. Some traders are fretting that Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to US corporation tax will push America\u2019s deficit higher, prompting even more borrowing. Another factor is that US consumer confidence dropped yesterday, which might signal some economic softness next year. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies has also hit a new all-time high. It\u2019s up a modest 23 points at 29,663. Familiar names like baking firm Greggs (+2.2%) and transport group Stobart (+1.9%) are among the risers. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time high! The Footsie has gained another 13 points, in a quiet trading session, hitting 7,633 points for the first time ever. Mining stocks such as Rio Tinto and Anglo American are up this morning, as commodity prices rise thanks to the weak dollar (as investors react to Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts). UK retailer Next and supermarket chain J Sainsbury are also in the top risers (up around 0.8% each). The FTSE 100 has gained more than 6.6% during 2017 - a solid performance, but one that is overshadowed by European and US markets. US companies involved in the blockchain - the \u2018digital ledger\u2019 technology that underpins bitcoin - are also under pressure in premarket trading. Reuters reports that Riot Blockchain is down 7.7% premarket, LongFin Corp has lost 5.7% percent, Overstock.com has dipped by 4.8%, while Nova LifeStyle has shed 4.1%. Yikes, a sudden squall of selling just swept bitcoin down to $13,500, wiping a few hundred dollar off its value in under a minute. It\u2019s now clawing its way back, though -- a reminder of how volatile digital currencies can be (not an ideal characteristic in a store of value...) Bitcoin update: It\u2019s currently bobbing around $13,990 on the BitStamp exchange in Luxembourg, down 8.5% so far today (and 28% below last week\u2019s record highs). Looking away from bitcoin, we\u2019ve just learned that UK mortgage approvals dropped to a 15-month low last month. Just 39,507 home purchase loans were approved in November, down from 41,702 a year ago, according to industry body UK Finance. That may show that the market is cooling, as the Bank of England raised interest rates at the start of November from 0.25% to 0.5%. Today the financial markets are mostly \u201cwatching Bitcoin (fanatics vs the controlling tendencies of governments and central banks) and dealing with year-end tidying-up operations\u201d says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: The Financial Times says today\u2019s clampdown shows South Korea is keen to take some heat out of its domestic bitcoin market: The measures include a ban on opening anonymous cryptocurrency accounts to boost transparency and legislation to allow regulators to close digital currency exchanges if needed, a recommendation made by the justice ministry worried about scams involving cryptocurrency trading. \u201cThe regulator is saying to exchanges to have proper cyber security and proper know-your-client processes in place,\u201d said Cedric Jeanson, chief executive of BitSpread, a cryptocurrency market maker. \u201cWith the market overheating in Korea, it is quite natural that the regulator thinks, \u2018let\u2019s make sure this is done properly\u2019.\u201d The government noted that most virtual currencies were trading at a premium on South Korean exchanges, despite a string of regulatory measures announced by the government this month designed to cool demand. South Korean traders are paying about 30 per cent over international rates for bitcoin, reflecting the popularity of the asset in the country and the difficulty in arbitraging among markets. Koreans prefer to use bitcoin exchanges in their home country rather than the US because they need to open a bank account in the US to buy the currency in that market \u2014 a cumbersome requirement. South Korea\u2019s new curbs on bitcoin come just nine days after a Seoul-based digital currency exchange declared itself bankrupt after being hacked for the second time. The Youbut exchange shut down after losing 17% of its assets in a cyber attack which was later blamed on North Korean hackers. Earlier this month, a cryto-mining marketplace called NiceHash said it had also been hacked, losing around 4,700 bitcoins. Both incidences highlighted one potential problem with digital currencies. Bitcoin futures are also falling sharply today, on CME\u2019s new derivatives platform (launched last week). The January bitcoin contract has shed $640 to $14,050 - broadly matching today\u2019s \u2018spot\u2019 price of bitcoin. The February and March futures contracts have also dropped to similar levels. But what does that mean? Well, these derivative contracts allow investors to wager that an asset will either rise or fall in value by a certain time. So you could conclude that traders don\u2019t expect bitcoin to recover much ground in the next few months. But it\u2019s more likely that the futures prices is basically just tracking the spot price. After all, it would take a brave investor to put their shirt on bitcoin\u2019s value in three months time (or three days, frankly...) European stock markets are subdued this morning, in a sharp contrast to bitcoin. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 rose by just 10 points to 7,630, which wasn\u2019t quite enough to catch yesterday\u2019s record high. Politicians in Seoul have been fretting about bitcoin for some time, leading up to today\u2019s crackdown on anonymous trading and the threat to close exchanges. Bloomberg explains: South Korea has been ground zero for a global surge in interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as prices surged this year, prompting the nation\u2019s prime minister to worry over the impact on Korean youth. While there\u2019s no immediate indication Asia\u2019s No. 4 economy will shutter exchanges that have accounted by some measures for more than fifth of global trading, the news poses a warning as regulators the world over express concerns about private digital currencies. Today\u2019s selloff has dragged bitcoin away from its pre-Christmas peak, but its still up around 1,400% this year. South Korea\u2019s cryptocurrency curbs suggest that officials are getting worried about the consequences of a digital currency crash. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda, says (via Bloomberg): \u201cRegulators are getting so concerned that this is primarily and predominantly a retail phenomenon. \u201cRegulators not only in Asia but globally are going to start addressing this fact because I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve actually come to terms with what the absolute downside of a complete drop in crypto means for the economy.\u201d Bitcoin is suffering fresh losses today after South Korea\u2019s government announced a clampdown on digital currencies. Bitcoin tumbled by 11% to below $14,000, meaning it has shed a quarter of its value since hitting its latest record high on 17th December. The selloff came as South Korea revealed it is taking several steps to combat speculation in cryptocurrencies. The measures include a ban on opening anonymous cryptocurrency accounts, and new legislation to allow regulators to close virtual coin exchanges if needed. Bitcoin has taken South Korea by storm - reportedly, 20% of all bitcoin transactions take place in the country. The government fears that the boom has gone too far. In a statement, it says: \u201cOfficials share the view that virtual currency trading is overheating irrationally ... and we can no longer overlook this abnormal speculative situation. South Korea is also keen to clamp down on criminals who use bitcoin to launder money, or fraudulently manipulate the price. AFP reports: \u201cWe will ... resolutely respond to such crimes by slapping maximum sentences possible on offenders,\u201d the government said, vowing to \u201cleave all policy options open, including closure of a cryptocurrency exchange when deemed necessary.\u201d This sent the bitcoin price reeling: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. 2017 has been a good year for shares, with most stock markets posting double-digit gains. And last night, the bull market swept Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 to a new closing high of 7,620 points. Can it do it again today? Possibly -- the futures markets are suggesting that the Footsie could creep a little higher today as more traders return to the City after the Christmas break. It will probably be a quiet trading session, though, as the markets stagger towards 2018. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says: With only two trading sessions remaining for 2017, liquidity dried up across the global markets. This has been obvious in U.S. and European equities, where volumes dropped significantly. However, some investors continued to tweak their portfolios slightly, leading to insignificant price action. I don\u2019t expect equities to deviate much throughout Thursday and Friday. Investors will also be watching for the European Central Bank\u2019s latest assessment of the eurozone economy, new UK home loan figures, and fresh trade and unemployment data from America. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9am GMT: European Central Bank publishes its economic bulletin 9:30am GMT: UK mortgage loans for November 1.30pm GMT: US trade balance for November 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures",

government this month designed to cool demand.</p> <p>South Korean traders are paying about 30 per cent over international rates for bitcoin, reflecting the popularity of the asset in the country and the difficulty in arbitraging among markets.</p> <p>Koreans prefer to use bitcoin exchanges in their home country rather than the US because they need to open a bank account in the US to buy the

      "bodyText": "From the head of Europe\u2019s biggest short-haul airline to an heir to the Murdoch empire, here are 10 well-known business figures expected to hit the headlines next year, for good or ill. Michael O\u2019Leary In 2011, the chief executive of Ryanair, Michael O\u2019Leary, outlined his pitch for one of the most sought-after honours in the world: \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a war in Europe for 50 years, because they\u2019re all too busy flying on Ryanair. I should get the Nobel peace prize \u2013 screw Bono.\u201d Shamefully, the Nobel committee continues to overlook O\u2019Leary as a potential laureate, although he is increasingly being recognised in other areas. Having admitted that his company may not always have treated its passengers quite as they hoped, O\u2019Leary is now contending with critics who accuse the airline of mistreating its staff. Ryanair will be investigated by two parliamentary committees after allegations about employee working conditions, including that it has been \u201ctrying to wriggle out\u201d of paying its staff the national minimum wage, while setting tough in-flight sales targets. The airline has said the claims about cabin crew pay and working conditions \u201care false\u201d. However, O\u2019Leary announced this month that he will begin talks to recognise pilot and cabin crew trade unions. The success of these discussions will make him a subject of even greater focus than usual next year. Emma Walmsley GlaxoSmithKline backed away from its oncology drugs two years ago under Walmsley\u2019s predecessor, Sir Andrew Witty, but 2018 will represent efforts by the company to re-enter the field. She has reinstated cancer treatments as one of the planks of her strategy to restore the company\u2019s fortunes since taking the role last spring, after GSK lagged rivals in in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters. It is now up to Walmsley to restore faith in the group\u2019s research and development skills. James Murdoch What next for James Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox and younger son of Rupert Murdoch? Well, he is expected to leave his father\u2019s corporate orbit next year once Disney completes its $66bn (\u00a349bn) acquisition of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets. Disney has floated the possibility that Murdoch Jr might join the group in an executive role, and if he does the 45-year-old will be seen as a potential successor to Bob Iger, the Disney boss who looks unlikely to be wrestled out of the door until 2021. Otherwise, Murdoch is expected to strike out on his own, given that his job with Fox will no longer be there if regulators clear the deal. The Winklevoss twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss saw a new trend coming with the advent of social media. Unfortunately for them, their foresight did not extend to keeping a hold on the idea, so they ended up suing Mark Zuckerberg, who they claimed stole their idea for a social network and called it \u201cthe Facebook\u201d. Next year might give them a shot at further redemption after they became bitcoin billionaires in 2017. Having bought about 100,000 units of the cryptocurrency in 2013, when each coin was worth roughly $120, the value of each one rose to nearly $12,000 in early December and kept on soaring. Much of the financial world is waiting for what they view as a bubble to burst. Nicky Morgan Being one of the infamous Daily Telegraph front page \u201cBrexit mutineers\u201d did not faze the Conservative MP for Loughborough (she pinned a copy to her office wall), so it is hard to envisage her backing away from the limelight during 2018. She is not backing a second referendum, but believes leaving with no deal is suicidal. \u201cNo deal I think is a critical thing. And my role is to stop that happening,\u201d she said in December. Morgan has a platform for her campaign too, as chair of the influential Treasury select committee, which is likely to add to her profile and possibly her impact. Jeff Bezos The 53-year-old creator of Amazon is the world\u2019s richest man: his fortune increased by about $34bn in 2017 to take his net worth to $99.6bn. Having founded Amazon in his Seattle garage in 1994, Bezos now owns 16% of the retailer, which is hardly loved but appears practically unstoppable. He also owns all of space exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post newspaper, which he bought for $250m in 2013. The question for 2018 is: can he get any richer? Steve Rowe Steve Rowe, the boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, is a veteran employee of the high street retailer, having taken a Saturday job in the Croydon store at the age of 15. Still, it is unlikely that even Rowe will have witnessed many years as crucial to M&amp;S as 2018 is shaping up to be. Alongside new chairman Archie Norman, the chief executive is attempting to revitalise this British institution. The scale of how far M&amp;S has fallen behind, however, is betrayed by the stock market: in 2017 its market value was eclipsed by takeaway group JustEat and by fashion firm Asos. Neither of the online companies was even close to being conceived when Rowe started his M&amp;S career. Sir Martin Sorrell The chief executive of the advertising firm WPP is surely someone to watch in 2018 \u2013 just ask him, he\u2019ll tell you so. Always interesting, sometimes entertaining and occasionally controversial, Sorrell tends to make himself relevant to the news cycle if there\u2019s ever a chance he might get overlooked. That is doubly true in World Cup years, when ad spend tends to get a bit of a lift, plus periods where there is any turbulence in geopolitics. It is unlikely he\u2019ll stay voluntarily quiet in 2018. Tim Martin Forget Al Murray, the boss of JD Wetherspoon is the real pub landlord. The Brexiter is one of the most articulate \u2013 and compelling \u2013 of the high-profile leave supporters, so is almost always worth listening to, no matter which way you voted. He has argued that Brexit should mean lower food prices (key remainers say it will mean the opposite), but if that seems far-fetched it\u2019s worth recalling how Martin was once derided for his views on the euro, which now look sage-like. Still, if the economy suffers any Brexit wobbles, and his pubs get hit, it will be worth watching him trying to explain why Brexit is a smart move.",

      "bodyText": "Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, was paid $102m (\u00a376m) this year after collecting a huge share bonus linked to the iPhone maker\u2019s stock market performance. Cook was paid a basic salary of $3.06m, a cash bonus of $9.3m (up from $5.4m last year), and collected share awards worth $89m taking his total 2017 payout to $102m, Apple disclosed in a regulatory filing. The bonus of 560,000 shares paid out in September. Cook received half the award because Apple\u2019s stock delivered shareholder returns in the top third of the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 index during the past three years. He got the other 280,000 shares for simply staying in the job. The stock package awarded to Cook when he became chief executive in 2011 was originally valued at $376m, but is now worth much more because Apple shares have increased six-fold since he signed the deal. As long as he remains the boss, Cook will receive 560,000 shares of stock annually until 2020. He will then get 1.26m shares in August 2021 as the final payment under his original contract. Apple\u2019s filing also revealed that it requires Cook to travel by private aircraft \u201cfor all business and personal travel\u201d for security reasons. Cook\u2019s use of the private jet for his holidays cost the company $93,000. The cost of his personal security detail was $224,000. Cook collected an extra $104,000 in \u201cvacation cash out\u201d, and his basic $3m salary was increased to $3,057,692 \u201cbecause 2017 was a 53-week fiscal year, the 2017 salary amounts reflect an extra week of pay\u201d. That extra week\u2019s pay is slightly more than the median US annual household income of $56,516, according to the US Census. Cook\u2019s top five lieutenants were paid about $24.2m each. Luca Maestri, chief financial officer; Angela Ahrendts, head of retail; Johny Srouji, head of hardware technology; Dan Riccio, head of hardware engineering; and Bruce Sewell, the outgoing general counsel, collected $20m in share awards, cash bonuses of $3.1m and basic pay of just over $1m. The amount paid to Jony Ive, the company\u2019s British chief design officer, was not included in the filing. Apple\u2019s shares have increased by more than 200% since Cook became chief executive in August 2011, shortly before founder and previous chief executive Steve Jobs died. The shares peaked at $176.4 on 18 December but have since weakened slightly to $170.60 following reports of weaker than expected demand for its new $999 iPhone X.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "The year in business: bitcoin boom, Brexit countdown and Uber trouble", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It will be remembered as the year Theresa May triggered article 50 and began the official countdown to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. It was also the year of two budgets, one general election and the first UK interest rate rise in a decade. The year was littered with resignations, gaffes, boardroom bust-ups and takeovers, and if you had about $15,000 (\u00a311,200) to spare you could buy one whole bitcoin. Take a look back at some of the significant stories of 2017. 1. Bitcoin \u2026 up, up and away One of the most fascinating stories of 2017 was bitcoin and its inexorable rise. The cryptocurrency became harder to ignore as the year went on, at one point surging from $9,000 to above $11,000 in less than 24 hours. The value of bitcoin has risen 900% this year, making it 2017\u2019s fastest growing asset and prompting critics to declare it a classic speculative bubble that could burst like the dotcom boom. In September the boss of JP Morgan said bitcoin was a fraud that would blow up, fit for use only by drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea, and he compared it to the tulip bubble of the 1600s. Sir Howard Davies, chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, likened it to Dante\u2019s inferno: \u201cAbandon hope all ye who enter here.\u201d In December however, bitcoin took a step towards legitimacy when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, offered bitcoin futures, allowing traders to bet on the future price. One bitcoin is now above $16,000. Dante\u2019s inferno or sound investment? Bitcoin is one to watch in 2018. 2. Blankfein causes a Twitter stir This year Lloyd Blankfein embraced Twitter, six years after first joining the site. While he might not be as prolific on Twitter as the likes of Donald Trump, averaging two-and-a-half tweets a month since his debut in June, the boss of Goldman Sachs made them count. Topics ranged from US immigration to a second EU referendum and terrorism on both sides of the Atlantic. Perhaps most eye-catching was a tweet on 19 October that captured the mounting anxiety felt in the UK about the potential relocation of thousands of lucrative City jobs to other European cities. Simple, but effective: it was retweeted and liked thousands of times and timed perfectly to add to the pressure on Theresa May before a summit in Brussels. Other highlights included a picture of himself with Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and chief executive of Twitter, with the tag line: \u201cAnd they say I don\u2019t know Jack!\u201d His last tweet before Christmas was dedicated to Brexit and his apparent reluctance to accept it as a done deal. Commenting on a poll that suggested Britons now backed remain over leave by 10 points, he wrote: \u201c#Brexit decision belongs to UK citizens, and I\u2019m not one. But GS built its Euro biz in the UK on certain assumptions, pays taxes and employs thousands of UK citizens concerned about the economy and their futures. On their behalf, at least, I have to be interested in the outcome.\u201d . 3. The return of the rate rise It was a long time coming. In November the Bank of England finally raised interest rates, for the first time in more than a decade. The last time rates were raised was July 2007, when the benchmark cost of borrowing was increased to 5.75% from 5.5%. At that time, Sir Mervyn King was in charge at Threadneedle Street, Barack Obama had only recently said he would run to be US president and Gordon Brown had replaced Tony Blair as prime minister. Fast-forward a decade and, even after the quarter-point rise, rates remain very low, at 0.5%. But the move by the nine-strong monetary policy committee \u2013 led by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney - was significant nonetheless. An estimated 2 million mortgage holders had not experienced a rate rise since taking out their loan. They might have to get to used it, after the MPC indicated another two rate rises were likely over the next three years, in the absence of a Brexit shock. Policymakers on the MPC must now gauge whether indebted households will be spooked by the prospect of higher rates or take it in their stride. 4. The super rich get richer The already very rich got even richer in 2017, so much so that UBS, the Swiss bank that advises many of them on where to put their money, said the world was witnessing a new \u201cgilded age\u201d. The richest 1% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 7.6 million people \u2013 made so much money this year that for the first time their share of all the world\u2019s wealth ticked over 50%. The 1% are collectively worth $140tn (\u00a3106tn) \u2013 50.1% of all the money in the world. Their share has increased from 42.5% at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, while the \u201csqueezed middle\u201d are struggling to stand still and more than 2 billion of the world\u2019s poorest have effectively zero assets. Josef Stadler, UBS\u2019s head of global ultra high net worth, said vast amounts of wealth were being held in only a few hands, in an echo of the \u201cgilded age\u201d at the turn of the 20th century when families such as the Carnegies, Rockefellers and Vanderbilts controlled vast fortunes. \u201cWealth concentration is as high as in 1905, this is something billionaires are concerned about,\u201d Stadler said. He said the rich increasingly wanted to show they were using their wealth for good and hopefully avoid a \u201cstrike back\u201d from the hard-pressed majority. 5. Treasury committee shows its teeth, Hogg goes The Treasury committee proved in March that it had teeth as it played a key role in the resignation of Charlotte Hogg as the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor for markets and banking \u2013 a month after her appointment. Her mistake was her failure to declare a potential conflict of interest, after it emerged her brother worked for Barclays. Hogg ran into difficulty at the Treasury committee hearing to confirm her appointment, typically a run-of-the-mill event but not so on this occasion. The verdict of MPs on the committee, chaired at the time by Andrew Tyrie, was damning. It concluded Hogg\u2019s \u201cprofessional competence falls short of the very high standards required to fulfil the additional responsibilities of deputy governor for markets and banking\u201d, leaving her position untenable. It was a rapid fall from grace and clearly frustrating for Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor and a supporter of Hogg. As the events played out, Tyrie demonstrated his effectiveness in a role he would later relinquish as he stood down as an MP at the general election in June. 6. Airline mayhem \u2013 Monarch and Ryanair Monarch Airline passengers arrived at airports on Monday 2 October to find their flights cancelled and holiday plans disrupted. The collapse into administration of Britain\u2019s longest-surviving airline brand left 110,000 customers to be brought home on specially chartered planes, while a further 750,000 were told their bookings had been cancelled. Problems in the low-cost airline industry in 2017 were not limited to Monarch. Ryanair announced the cancellation of thousands of flights affecting a total of 715,000 customers, blaming a lack of available pilots owing to a rota \u201cmess up\u201d \u2013 a mess that quickly escalated into a dispute between the airline and its pilots over employment terms and conditions. Never one to shy away from controversy, the chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, applied his own style of diplomacy to the situation, accusing pilots of being \u201cprecious about themselves\u201d and \u201cfull of their own self-importance\u201d. However, in December O\u2019Leary announced he would recognise pilot and cabin trade unions, something that would have been unthinkable in his pomp. 7. Farce ensues at the LSE The year\u2019s most extraordinary boardroom spat took place at the London Stock Exchange Group. A row broke out between the chairman of London Stock Exchange and Sir Chris Hohn, whose hedge fund Children\u2019s Investment Fund Management (TCI) owns 5% of LSE. When LSE announced in October that its chief executive, Xavier Rolet, would be leaving at the end of 2018 after an impressive run for a decade or so in the job, TCI was convinced he was being pushed out and the battle began. TCI called for an emergency shareholder vote to keep Rolet on and instead force out Brydon. The situation escalated to the extent that Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, was reluctantly drawn into the mess. He told reporters he was \u201cmystified\u201d by the row over the departure. Crucially, Carney said Rolet had \u201cmade an extraordinary contribution \u2026 [but] everything comes to an end\u201d. A day later, LSE said Rolet had agreed to leave with immediate effect. Nevertheless, Hohn pursued the immediate removal of Brydon and led a sizeable rebellion in which 21% of shareholder votes were cast against the chairman at an extraordinary general meeting. With 79% of the vote, however, Brydon survived. 8. Uber\u2019s annus horribilis In June Uber\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick, stepped down, bowing to calls from five of Uber\u2019s largest investors. Kalanick had been under pressure since February when a former employee published a blogpost describing a workplace rife with gender discrimination and sexual harassment. He was replaced in August by Dara Khosrowshahi, formerly the chief executive of travel company Expedia. Khosrowshahi had barely started his role when Transport for London dealt a fresh blow to the firm by refusing to issue it a new licence to operate in London. TfL came to the damning conclusion that Uber was not a \u201cfit and proper\u201d private car hire operator. Hundreds of thousands of furious London customers signed a petition and some of the capital\u2019s MPs said the move removed choice for Londoners. But Uber remains free to operate in London \u2013 where it has 3.5 million users \u2013 until it has exhausted the appeals process, something which could take months if not years. In November Uber attracted more criticism when it admitted 2.7 million people in the UK were affected by a 2016 security breach that compromised customers\u2019 information, and in the same month Uber lost an appeal on a tribunal case brought by two drivers last year, who argued they should be classed as employees rather than self-employed. A terrible year was topped off this month when a European court of justice ruling went against Uber by declaring it was a transport services company that must abide by the same regulations as other cab firms. 9. A day in the life of Mike Ashley Mike Ashley is known for his unconventional approach to business matters but revelations in the high court in July gave a new insight into the modus operandi of the Sports Direct owner. According to evidence submitted by Jeff Blue, a former banker, Ashley regularly held senior management meetings during \u201clock-ins\u201d at the Green Dragon pub in Alfreton, near Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse. One such meeting ended with Ashley vomiting into a fireplace in the middle of the pub after downing 12 pints and chasers in a drinking competition with a young analyst. \u201cMr Ashley ... vomited into the fireplace located in the centre of the bar, to huge applause from his senior management team.\u201d Blue claimed that at another boozy pub meeting, in 2013, Ashley agreed to pay him \u00a315m if he could help double Sports Direct\u2019s share price within three years. Sports Direct\u2019s shares hit the \u00a38 price target in February 2014, and Ashley paid Blue a \u00a31m bonus in May the same year, but said it was discretionary and not a downpayment on the alleged \u00a315m deal. Ashley won the court case, with Mr Justice Leggatt ruling that no one would have thought what Ashley had said in the pub was \u201cserious\u201d. 10. Murdoch breaks up his empire Rupert Murdoch\u2019s career has been defined by deals that expanded his realm, but December saw the announcement of a deal that diminished it. Disney said it would buy the bulk of the tycoon\u2019s 21st Century Fox media and entertainment business, including a 39% stake in Sky, in a $66bn (\u00a349bn) deal. This was, effectively, a circling of the wagons for the 86-year-old as he fell back on a group of assets that comprised Fox News and, in the separately listed News Corp, newspapers including the Sun and the New York Post. The deal, if cleared by competition regulators in the US and UK, also clarified the issue of succession. Lachlan Murdoch, the 46-year-old eldest son, was left as executive heir to the remaining empire while 45-year-old James Murdoch, who runs 21st Century Fox, is set for a role at Disney or faces the prospect of starting a new venture outside of the family firm. Fox\u2019s proposed takeover of the 61% of Sky it does not own is also set to fall by the wayside. It will be a significant reshaping of Murdoch\u2019s empire. 11. Brexit gets real 2017 was the year that the scale of the Brexit challenge started to emerge. Theresa May triggered article 50 and the official two-year countdown to the divorce began. In talks between the UK\u2019s David Davis and the EU\u2019s Michel Barnier, progress appeared painfully slow. Businesses became increasingly anxious about just how messy this divorce might be. Trade bodies argued that their members would put on hold investment plans for 2018 without clarity on a deal. Meanwhile the City said contingency plans for moving thousands of jobs abroad would become reality in the absence of detail on a deal. Britain\u2019s slide down the G7 league table of growth this year added to concerns that the negative effects of the Brexit vote were starting to take hold. News that a breakthrough on phase one of the talks had finally been achieved in early December, meaning negotiations could begin, was met with relief but not jubilation. The message from business was clear: the hard work starts now. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "body": "<p>It will be remembered as the year Theresa May triggered article 50 and began the official countdown to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. It was also the year of two budgets, one general election and the first UK interest rate rise in a decade. The year was littered with resignations, gaffes, boardroom bust-ups and takeovers, and if you had about $15,000 (\u00a311,200) to spare you could buy one whole bitcoin. Take a look back at some of the significant stories of 2017.</p> <h2><strong>1. Bitcoin \u2026 up, up and away</strong></h2> <p>One of the most fascinating stories of 2017 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/11/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-bitcoin-but-were-to-afraid-to-ask-cryptocurrencies\">bitcoin and its inexorable rise</a>. The cryptocurrency became harder to ignore as the year went on, at one point surging from $9,000 to above $11,000 in less than 24 hours. The value of bitcoin has risen 900% this year, making it 2017\u2019s fastest growing asset and prompting critics to declare it a classic speculative bubble that could burst like the dotcom boom. In September the boss of JP Morgan said bitcoin was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/13/bitcoin-fraud-jp-morgan-cryptocurrency-drug-dealers\">fraud that would blow up</a>, fit for use only by drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea, and he compared it to the tulip bubble of the 1600s. Sir Howard Davies, chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/07/rbs-sir-howard-davies-bitcoin-dantes-inferno-digital-currency\">likened it to Dante\u2019s inferno</a>: \u201cAbandon hope all ye who enter here.\u201d In December however, bitcoin took a step towards legitimacy when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world\u2019s biggest exchange, offered bitcoin futures, allowing traders to bet on the future price. One bitcoin is now above $16,000. Dante\u2019s inferno or sound investment? Bitcoin is one to watch in 2018.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1813ba10a9556be837269956d7d6ee6e5b33c2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1813ba10a9556be837269956d7d6ee6e5b33c2f/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>2. Blankfein causes a Twitter stir</strong></h2> <p>This year Lloyd Blankfein embraced Twitter, six years after first joining the site. While he might not be as prolific on Twitter as the likes of Donald Trump, averaging two-and-a-half tweets a month since his debut in June, the boss of Goldman Sachs made them count. Topics ranged from US immigration to a second EU referendum and terrorism on both sides of the Atlantic. Perhaps most eye-catching was a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lloydblankfein/status/920995573368545280\">tweet on 19 October</a> that captured the mounting anxiety felt in the UK about the potential relocation of thousands of lucrative City jobs to other European cities. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\"></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lloydblankfein/status/920995573368545280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just left Frankfurt.

Other highlights included a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lloydblankfein/status/941032096197353473\">picture of himself with Jack Dorsey</a>, the co-founder and chief executive of Twitter, with the tag line: \u201cAnd they say I don\u2019t know Jack!\u201d His last tweet before Christmas was dedicated to Brexit and his apparent reluctance to accept it as a done deal. Commenting on a poll that suggested Britons now backed remain over leave by 10 points, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lloydblankfein/status/942505398837407744\">he wrote</a>: \u201c#Brexit decision belongs to UK citizens, and I\u2019m not one. But GS built its Euro biz in the UK on certain assumptions, pays taxes and employs thousands of UK citizens concerned about the economy and their futures. On their behalf, at least, I have to be interested in the outcome.\u201d .</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ee5e91dc20af5ea061cd0637728cfb8b5bd6829\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ee5e91dc20af5ea061cd0637728cfb8b5bd6829/0_98_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3. The return of the rate rise</strong></h2> <p>It was a long time coming. In November <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/02/bank-of-england-raises-uk-interest-rates-brexit-inflation\">the Bank of England finally raised interest rates</a>, for the first time in more than a decade. The last time rates were raised was July 2007, when the benchmark cost of borrowing was increased to 5.75% from 5.5%. At that time, Sir Mervyn King was in charge at Threadneedle Street, Barack Obama had only recently said he would run to be US president and Gordon Brown had replaced Tony Blair as prime minister. Fast-forward a decade and, even after the quarter-point rise, rates remain very low, at 0.5%. But the move by the nine-strong monetary policy committee \u2013 led by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney - was significant nonetheless. An estimated 2 million mortgage holders had not experienced a rate rise since taking out their loan. They might have to get to used it, after the MPC indicated another two rate rises were likely over the next three years, in the absence of a Brexit shock. Policymakers on the MPC must now gauge whether indebted households will be spooked by the prospect of higher rates or take it in their stride.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"36e41f4ab95eea5a36dfdc3d98e6f9c366ff3d0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36e41f4ab95eea5a36dfdc3d98e6f9c366ff3d0c/0_344_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Breakers, Vanderbilt mansion in Rhode Island, Newport, US\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Breakers, Vanderbilt mansion in Rhode Island, Newport, US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4. The super rich get richer</strong></h2> <p>The already very rich got even richer in 2017, so much so that UBS, the Swiss bank that advises many of them on where to put their money, said the world was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/worlds-witnessing-a-new-gilded-age-as-billionaires-wealth-swells-to-6tn\">witnessing a new \u201cgilded age\u201d</a>. The richest 1% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 7.6 million people \u2013 made so much money this year that for the first time their share of all the world\u2019s wealth ticked over 50%. The 1% are collectively worth $140tn (\u00a3106tn) \u2013 50.1% of all the money in the world. Their share has increased from 42.5% at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, while the \u201csqueezed middle\u201d are struggling to stand still and more than 2 billion of the world\u2019s poorest have effectively zero assets. Josef Stadler, UBS\u2019s head of global ultra high net worth, said vast amounts of wealth were being held in only a few hands, in an echo of the \u201cgilded age\u201d at the turn of the 20th century when families such as the Carnegies, Rockefellers and Vanderbilts controlled vast fortunes. \u201cWealth concentration is as high as in 1905, this is something billionaires are concerned about,\u201d Stadler said. He said the rich increasingly wanted to show they were using their wealth for good and hopefully avoid a \u201cstrike back\u201d from the hard-pressed majority. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0267ce532fa39a5b152b4fda815fcfa372d144c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0267ce532fa39a5b152b4fda815fcfa372d144c4/661_121_3236_1942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Hogg was forced to resign as the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Hogg was forced to resign as the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>5. Treasury committee shows its teeth, Hogg goes</strong></h2> <p>The Treasury committee proved in March that it had teeth as it played a key role in the resignation of Charlotte Hogg as the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor for markets and banking \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/14/mps-question-charlotte-hoggs-suitability-for-bank-of-england-role\">a month after her appointment</a>. Her mistake was her failure to declare a potential conflict of interest, after it emerged her brother worked for Barclays. Hogg ran into difficulty at the Treasury committee hearing to confirm her appointment, typically a run-of-the-mill event but not so on this occasion. The verdict of MPs on the committee, chaired at the time by Andrew Tyrie, was damning. It concluded Hogg\u2019s \u201cprofessional competence falls short of the very high standards required to fulfil the additional responsibilities of deputy governor for markets and banking\u201d, leaving her position untenable. It was a rapid fall from grace and clearly frustrating for Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor and a supporter of Hogg. As the events played out, Tyrie demonstrated his effectiveness in a role he would later relinquish as he stood down as an MP at the general election in June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21169e59564764cd6cdb6a7f081d84948b62c7e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21169e59564764cd6cdb6a7f081d84948b62c7e0/0_0_3381_2031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monarch Airline collapsed into administration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monarch Airline collapsed into administration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>6. Airline mayhem \u2013 Monarch and Ryanair </strong></h2> <p>Monarch Airline passengers arrived at airports on Monday 2 October to find their flights cancelled and holiday plans disrupted.

Problems in the low-cost airline industry in 2017 were not limited to Monarch. Ryanair announced the cancellation of thousands of flights affecting a total of 715,000 customers, blaming a lack of available pilots owing to a rota \u201cmess up\u201d \u2013 a mess that quickly escalated into a dispute between the airline and its pilots over employment terms and conditions. Never one to shy away from controversy, the chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, applied his own style of diplomacy to the situation, accusing pilots of being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/21/ryanair-boss-holiday-plans-michael-oleary-flight-cancellations\">\u201cprecious about themselves\u201d</a> and \u201cfull of their own self-importance\u201d. However, in December O\u2019Leary announced he would recognise pilot and cabin trade unions, something that would have been unthinkable in his pomp. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1001263b524f997ab12d3c78d37b9a69af52ae2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1001263b524f997ab12d3c78d37b9a69af52ae2e/0_84_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LSE\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The London Stock Exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>7.

Ashley won the court case, with Mr Justice Leggatt ruling that no one would have thought what Ashley had said in the pub was \u201cserious\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29c55f991a277d874699d38d7be8dc84b5da63c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29c55f991a277d874699d38d7be8dc84b5da63c4/0_14_614_368/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Iger, the Walt Disney chief executive, with Rupert Murdoch in London\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Iger, the Walt Disney chief executive, with Rupert Murdoch in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10. Murdoch breaks up his empire<br></h2> <p>Rupert Murdoch\u2019s career has been defined by deals that expanded his realm, but December saw the announcement of a deal that diminished it. Disney said it would buy the bulk of the tycoon\u2019s 21st Century Fox media and entertainment business, including a 39% stake in Sky, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/14/rupert-murdochs-60bn-disney-deal-reshapes-his-media-empire\">in a $66bn (\u00a349bn) deal</a>. This was, effectively, a circling of the wagons for the 86-year-old as he fell back on a group of assets that comprised Fox News and, in the separately listed News Corp, newspapers including the Sun and the New York Post. The deal, if cleared by competition regulators in the US and UK, also clarified the issue of succession. Lachlan Murdoch, the 46-year-old eldest son, was left as executive heir to the remaining empire while 45-year-old James Murdoch, who runs 21st Century Fox, is set for a role at Disney or faces the prospect of starting a new venture outside of the family firm. Fox\u2019s proposed takeover of the 61% of Sky it does not own is also set to fall by the wayside. It will be a significant reshaping of Murdoch\u2019s empire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b77ef34738235d4bb3b63fcc713b93714dc9892a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b77ef34738235d4bb3b63fcc713b93714dc9892a/0_82_3392_2036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The City of London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The City of London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Milstein/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>11. Brexit gets real</strong></h2> <p>2017 was the year that the scale of the Brexit challenge started to emerge. Theresa May triggered article 50 and the official two-year countdown to the divorce began. In talks between the UK\u2019s David Davis and the EU\u2019s Michel Barnier, progress appeared painfully slow. Businesses became increasingly anxious about just how messy this divorce might be. Trade bodies argued that their members would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/22/uk-business-chiefs-unite-urgent-brexit-transition-deal-david-davis\">put on hold investment plans for 2018</a> without clarity on a deal. Meanwhile the City said contingency plans for moving thousands of jobs abroad would become reality in the absence of detail on a deal. Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/20/uk-growth-italy-france-germany-oecd-brexit\">slide down the G7 league table of growth</a> this year added to concerns that the negative effects of the Brexit vote were starting to take hold. News that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/08/sufficient-progress-in-brexit-talks-announced-after-mays-dash-to-brussels\">breakthrough on phase one of the talks</a> had finally been achieved in early December, meaning negotiations could begin, was met with relief but not jubilation.

      "bodyText": "Trains, ships and automobiles have all been swept along in recent years by the electric power revolution \u2013 and planes are next. Passenger jets are poised for an electric makeover that could fundamentally change the economics and environmental outlook of the aviation industry. Up until now the fact that the necessary batteries weigh two tonnes each has limited the switch from fossil fuels to a totally electric-powered future. However, last month a consortium comprising Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens said they had found a way to use hybrid electric jet engines to conquer gravity. They are converting a regional jet into a demonstration plane, called the E-Fan X, which will be ready by 2020. Paul Stein, chief technology officer at Rolls-Royce, said: \u201cIt is a two-tonne battery pack \u2013 the batteries are still fairly heavy. Beating gravity into submission is a huge challenge, so weight is a big issue.\u201d The BAE 146 demo aircraft, a jet that seats up to 100 people, will at first have one of its four gas turbine engines replaced with the hybrid engine. This engine will be powered by batteries and an onboard generator using jet fuel. If successful, the team will then move to two electric engines. Siemens is designing the 2MW electric motor, Rolls is building the generator that powers the engine and Airbus will integrate the system into the plane and link it to flight controls. They are developing the hybrid motor because fully electric commercial flights are currently out of reach. Pound for pound, fossil fuels contain around 100 times as much energy as a lithium-ion battery, the most common electric power pack at present. In a car, which has its wheels planted firmly on the ground, engineering boffins can design a vehicle to offset that weight disadvantage. But in a machine that must lift itself off the ground and propel upwards this is a much harder problem to solve. This tricky dilemma is a challenge that has been embraced with renewed gusto in the aviation sector. \u201cAviation has always eluded electrification largely because of the size and weight of components involved,\u201d Stein said. \u201cBut technology has moved on apace. Electrification is now poised to make a significant impact.\u201d Stein said three classes of aviation are potentially within reach of an electric engine revolution. \u201cThe smallest is air taxis, which can take 1 to 4 people up to 75 miles. For small air taxis, the battery technology is almost ready now,\u201d he said. Some of these air taxis look like flying cars, such as those backed by Larry Page, one of Google\u2019s founders. Chinese-owned Terrafugia\u2019s \u201croadable aircraft\u201d drives like a typical car on the ground and fits in a standard single-car garage and can be pre-ordered for $300,000 (\u00a3224,000). Pipistrel, a Slovenian company, already makes a two-seater electric training plane. Airbus has also developed a two-seater, the E Fan, which flew across the Channel in 2015. The second market is the small, regional jet that can carry between 10 and 100 passengers. \u201cOur target end game is a fixed wing, regional hybrid design,\u201d Stein said of the E-Fan X project. The third market \u2013 the short-haul commercial market, dominated by Airbus\u2019s A320 and Boeing\u2019s 737 \u2013 is still some way off. Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical analyst at aviation Leeham News and Comment, said: \u201cFor ultra short range, it can be fully electric. For the range of today\u2019s thousands of single aisle [A320, 737] planes, it will have to be hybrid for at least another 30 years. For long range, it\u2019s unrealistic. There would have to be a breakthrough in fuel cells, or similar.\u201d Airlines are watching the evolution of electric battery technology with interest. EasyJet wants electric planes to fly passengers on its short-haul routes within 10 to 20 years. It has signed a deal with Wright Electric, a US engineering company, to develop electric-powered aircraft that could reach Paris and Amsterdam from London. The attractions for airlines are clear; depending on the oil price, jet fuel had accounted for between 17% and 36% of their running costs over the last few years. Stein reckons the E-Fan X could produce fuel savings of 15%. The rush to electric battery technology in the automobile sector and a renewed push by aviation is likely to lead to scientific breakthroughs in what is possible over the coming years. Samsung Electronics recently declared it increased the energy capacity of a lithium-ion battery by 45%, and decreased the time needed for a recharge, by incorporating graphene \u2013 an ultra-thin form of carbon \u2013 into the power pack. Lithium-ion battery chemistry is notoriously unstable, prone to overheating and catching fire \u2013 not ideal when cruising at 35,000 feet. \u201cFor us, safety is paramount. The burden of proof to ensure we maintain that safety margin is very high,\u201d Stein said. \u201cWe cannot have a battery chemistry that risks a fire.\u201d So, lots of big hitters are ploughing huge investment and brain-power into developing alternative battery chemistries. One promising option is a solid-state lithium battery, which replaces the liquid electrolyte of current cells with a solid substitute. Such batteries offer much higher energy densities and should also be cheap to mass produce. Huge riches await those that can crack the problem and produce a next generation power source that is cheaper and greener. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "UK economy boosted by wage growth and rising output, two surveys say", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The British economy has received a double boost from reports showing signs of modest wage growth and accelerating output from businesses. According to a study by the jobs search engine Adzuna, the average salary for vacancies advertised online in November was 1.2% higher than the same month a year before \u2013 the first annual increase recorded by the website since June 2015. Meanwhile, a survey by the business group the CBI found firms reporting a rise in economic output. The studies are likely to reassure the Bank of England that the UK can cope with last month\u2019s rise in interest rates \u2013 the first in a decade \u2013 when the central bank increased the cost of borrowing from 0.25% to 0.5%. The evidence of pay growth could also help it to raise rates again next year because higher wages could lead to firms hiking the cost of their goods and services to accommodate paying staff more money. The CBI survey \u2013 based on 642 responses across the distribution, manufacturing and service sectors \u2013 showed the balance of firms reporting a rise in economic output at +19% in the three months to December, compared with a balance of +6% in the three months to November. Growth was broad-based, with all sectors reporting robust volume growth at a pace above their long-run averages. However, the lobby group, which represents 190,000 businesses, warned that growth will probably slip to a more moribund pace over the coming months, stalling in the service sector and slowing elsewhere. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic intelligence, said: \u201cPrivate-sector firms are enjoying healthy activity levels as we approach the year end, but mediocre expectations for growth underline the ongoing challenges facing companies.\u201d Adzuna said the average advertised annual salary in November was \u00a332,598 across the UK. It said salaries had increased at a rate of 2.2% from a year before in London to stand at \u00a339,457, while there was a decrease of 12.2% for graduates. Average pay for graduates was \u00a321,814. However, the growth in wages still trails the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation, which rose at an annual rate of 3.1% last month. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said this week that earnings growth when accounting for inflation is expected to be zero over the course of 2018 as a whole, meaning the pressure on living standards is set to continue. So far, prices have been rising almost entirely as a consequence of the pound\u2019s weakness since the EU referendum in June 2016, due to the higher cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. While the Bank\u2019s first rate hike last month will help curb further price growth, it still expects the CPI to be above its target rate of 2% over the next three years. The Bank also believes the growth potential of the economy before prices begin to spiral has been lowered since the Brexit vote, meaning signals of accelerating economic growth could also push up the CPI.",

Growth was broad-based, with all sectors reporting robust volume growth at a pace above their long-run averages.</p> <p>However, the lobby group, which represents 190,000 businesses, warned that growth will probably slip to a more moribund pace over the coming months, stalling in the service sector and slowing elsewhere.</p> <p>Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic intelligence, said: \u201cPrivate-sector firms are enjoying healthy activity levels as we approach the year end, but mediocre expectations for growth underline the ongoing challenges facing companies.\u201d</p> <p>Adzuna said the average advertised annual salary in November was \u00a332,598 across the UK. It said salaries had increased at a rate of 2.2% from a year before in London to stand at \u00a339,457, while there was a decrease of 12.2% for graduates.

The Resolution Foundation thinktank said this week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/27/zero-real-wage-growth-britain-end-2018-forecasts\">earnings growth when accounting for inflation is expected to be zero</a> over the course of 2018 as a whole, meaning the pressure on living standards is set to continue.<br></p> <p>So far, prices have been rising almost entirely as a consequence of the pound\u2019s weakness since the EU referendum in June 2016, due to the higher cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. </p> <p>While the Bank\u2019s first rate hike last month will help curb further price growth, it still expects the CPI to be above its target rate of 2% over the next three years.</p> <p>The Bank also believes the growth potential of the economy before prices begin to spiral has been lowered since the Brexit vote, meaning signals of accelerating economic growth could also push up the CPI. <br></p> <p> </p>",
