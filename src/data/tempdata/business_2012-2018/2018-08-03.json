      "bodyText": "China has unveiled plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on US imports worth $60bn (\u00a346bn), firing the latest volley in the mounting trade dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies \u2013 which are currently conducting \u201czero\u201d dialogue on trade, according to reports. Signalling the nation\u2019s readiness to respond to the higher tariffs threatened by Donald Trump on $200bn of Chinese imports, officials in Beijing said countermeasures were ready and waiting for the next move from Washington. The Chinese finance ministry said 5,207 goods imported from the US could be subjected to the fresh tariffs, with levies ranging from 5% to 25% on products including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour. The move comes after Trump asked US trade officials to consider imposing a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese goods, up from the 10% level originally proposed last month, as the two countries attempt to reach an agreement on trade. China said at the time blackmail would not work and that it would hit back. Speaking just hours after China unveiled the countermeasures on Friday, Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, said the US president was willing to follow through with his threats, in a stark warning to Beijing. Calling the Chinese economy \u201cweak\u201d from the lawn of the White House in an interview with Bloomberg TV, Kudlow said: \u201cThe president has said time and again, that targeted tariffs are going to be part of the gameplan with China \u2013 unless, and until, they begin to meet our requests, and so far they have not. \u201cThey better not underestimate President Trump\u2019s determination to follow through on our asks.\u201d Signalling a marked deterioration in relations, a senior administration official told CNBC later on Friday that there was now zero engagement on trade between US and Chinese trade officials. The development suggests the Trump administration\u2019s effort to force Beijing to reform its economic strategy by escalating the dispute with additional tariffs earlier this week has been unsuccessful. On Thursday, the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, told Fox Business News: \u201cWe have to create a situation where it\u2019s more painful for them to continue their bad practices than it is to reform. \u201cThe reason for the tariffs to begin with was to try and convince the Chinese to modify their behavior. Instead they have been retaliating. So the president now feels that it\u2019s potentially time to put more pressure on, in order to modify their behavior,\u201d he added. Despite IMF warnings that an escalation of the US-China trade dispute could pose risks for the global economy, Ross sought to downplay the threat of disruption, saying US tariffs would only add up to about half of all Chinese imports. A 25% levy \u201con $200bn, if it comes to pass, is $50bn a year,\u201d Ross told Fox. \u201c$50bn a year on an $18tn economy\u201d was a fraction of a percent, he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to be cataclysmic.\u201d The latest exchanges in the mounting trade war between the US and some of its biggest trading partners, including China, the EU, Canada and Mexico, comes amid early signs of damage for the world economy. The Bank of England said on Thursday protectionist trade policies were beginning to have an adverse impact, most notably on indicators of global goods trade. Growth in factory output has begun slowing across advanced economies, while business leaders fear further escalation. The Chinese yuan was on track to complete its eighth weekly decline on Friday, its longest losing streak in 25 years. While that could signal investors pulling money from the country, it could also help Chinese exporters manage the impact of higher US import tariffs. Washington had already imposed import tariffs on $34bn of Chinese goods last month, with Beijing immediately retaliating. According to Reuters, the Chinese commerce minister said in a statement after the latest round of tariff threats that the US had \u201crepeatedly escalated the situation against the interests of both enterprises and consumers\u201d. The minister added: \u201cChina has to take necessary countermeasures to defend its dignity and the interests of its people.\u201d Trump has accused China of pursuing unfair trading practices and stealing US firms\u2019 intellectual property, while using import tariffs to push Beijing towards renegotiating its trade policy with the US. The president has also imposed steel and import tariffs on several important trading partners, including the EU, Mexico and Canada, saying they are required to protect US jobs and industry. Although Kudlow called China intransigent, he said there were hints of both sides being able to get back around the negotiating table. The president\u2019s chief economic adviser also revealed there would be a \u201cnumber of announcements\u201d over the next 30 days covering trade deals with the EU. While Trump has threatened to put import tariffs on European cars, Kudlow said the president\u2019s recent transatlantic visit had led to constructive talks with the EU. \u201c[We will] begin the process of a grand deal to tear down barriers and open up markets [with the EU],\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "And finally...here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on the escalating US-China trade war. China has unveiled plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on US imports worth $60bn (\u00a346bn), firing the latest volley in the mounting trade dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Signalling the nation\u2019s readiness to respond to the higher tariffs threatened by Donald Trump on $200bn of Chinese imports, officials in Beijing said countermeasures were ready and waiting for the next move from Washington. The Chinese finance ministry said 5,207 goods imported from the US could be subjected to the fresh tariffs, with levies ranging from 5% to 25% on products including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour. The move comes after Trump asked US trade officials to consider imposing a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese goods, up from the 10% level originally proposed last month, as the two countries attempt to reach an agreement on trade. China said at the time blackmail would not work and that it would hit back. Speaking just hours after China unveiled the countermeasures on Friday, Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, said the US president was willing to follow through with his threats, in a stark warning to Beijing. Calling the Chinese economy weak from the lawn of the White House in an interview with Bloomberg TV, Kudlow said: \u201cThe president has said time and again, that targeted tariffs are going to be part of the gameplan with China \u2013 unless, and until, they begin to meet our requests, and so far they have not. \u201cThey better not underestimate President Trump\u2019s determination to follow through on our asks.\u201d.... Here\u2019s the full story: So, with the US stock market up a bit (the Dow has gained 99 points or 0.3% to 25,425 points), that\u2019s all for today. Goodnight! GW Bad news for European consumers - the cost of vegetables, bread and even beer is being driven up by the hot summer. With crops struggling in the fields, supermarkets are finding it hard to get produce - so the law of supply and demand is kicking in..... Here\u2019s my colleague Ed Helmore on the latest US employment data: The London stock market has closed higher this afternoon, despite the latest trade war tensions. The blue-chip FTSE 100 gained 83 points, or 1.1%, to finish at 7,659 points. The French and German markets also gained around 0.5%, even though their economies could be hit in a trade war. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says traders shrugged off the tariff threat: Despite Beijing preparing its own retaliatory \u2018import tax\u2019 on $60 billion of US goods if Trump goes ahead with his planned tariffs on $200 billion of products from China, the markets managed to continued their end of week rebound on Friday. UK shares benefitted from the weaker pound, he points out: Sterling spending the day sporadically ducking under $1.30 against the dollar following July\u2019s disappointing services PMI and Mark Carney\u2019s threat that chances of a no-deal Brexit are \u2018uncomfortably high\u2019. Larry Kudlow has reportedly cocked a snook at China\u2019s retaliation: China can\u2019t actually retaliate like-for-like, though, as it\u2019s total imports from America don\u2019t add up to $200bn Just in: Growth across America\u2019s service sector has dropped to its lowest level in almost a year, and trade wars are getting the blame. The Institute of Supply Management\u2019s monthly healthcheck on the sector has dropped to 55.7 in July, from 59.1 in June. Any reading over 50 shows growth, but this is a sharp monthly decline. Some service sector managers said the trade war with China is hurting their businesses One said: \u201cBusiness is up overall, but a lot of questions loom over the rest of the year. These include concerns about international markets and the increasing tariffs that impact the landed costs of goods. Larry Kudlow has now told reporters that there have been top-level talks between the US and China on trade. Rreuters has the details: President Donald Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Friday there has been some communication \u201cat the highest level\u201d on trade between the United States and China in recent days. Kudlow, answering questions from reporters on the WhiteHouse driveway, would not say who was involved in the communication or what was discussed. Larry Kudlow, Donald Trump\u2019s top economic advisor, is speaking to Bloomberg TV now. On today\u2019s jobs report, Kudlow argues that there is still significant slack in the US labor market, even though the jobless rate has ticked down to 3.9% There are still a lot of Americans out there who could come back into the labor force. Our potential to grow is very strong, and with the right incentives we\u2019ll get them working again. And on trade, Kudlow launches a blast at China, claiming that its economy is weakening. He says that the yuan has weakened because China is a \u201clousy investment\u201d, meaning capital is leaving the country. They\u2019ll be in a \u201cheap of trouble\u201d if that continues, Kudlow adds. Kudlow says: They\u2019re in a weak economic position... that\u2019s not a good place to be in vis a vis trade negotiations. Beijing had \u201cbetter not underestimate president Trump\u2019s determination to follow through on our asks\u201d, Kudlow continues. That includes demands that China stops stealing intellectual property, forcing US companies to share technology, and rips up non-reciprocal tariffs and trade barriers. Q: Are you trying to exert maximum pressure on the Chinese economy, to get them to the negotiation table? We are serious, Kudlow replies, and trade negotiations often include the use of tariffs. He reveals that America hasn\u2019t had much discussion with China on trade in recent months, and blames the \u201cintransigence\u201d of the Chinese side. Kudlow adds that Trump had a \u201cgreat\u201d meeting with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker last week. He expects lots of announcements in the next 30 days following those talks. Speaking earlier to Fox News, Kudlow also claimed that the US was making progress with the NATFA talks, leaving China \u2018increasingly isolated\u2019. CNN has more details of China\u2019s latest tariff threat: Products in line for tariffs include meat, coffee, nuts, alcoholic drinks, minerals, chemicals, leather products, wood products, machinery, furniture and auto parts. By announcing new proposed tariffs, China risks throwing fuel on its already smouldering trade war with America. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take: Duties ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent will be levied on 5,207 kinds of American imports if the U.S. delivers its proposed taxes on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website late Friday. The retaliation stands to further inflame tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and echoes China\u2019s response to the previous round of tariffs which took effect last month. President Donald Trump this week ordered officials to consider imposing a 25 percent tax on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods, up from an initial 10 percent rate. The move was intended to bring China back to the negotiating table for talks over U.S. demands for structural changes to the Chinese economy and a cut in the bilateral trade deficit. China has released a list of US products which could be hit with new import duties. The list includes a range of agricultural products; Beijing continues to target American farmers as the trade spat with Washington spices up. Some small aircraft are also on the list. China has also made it clear that these tariffs would only be imposed if America presses on with its tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. In other words, Beijing is trying to stick to its position that it won\u2019t intensify the trade dispute, but it won\u2019t roll over either. The trade ministry says: \u201cChina always believes that consultation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit is an effective way to resolve trade differences. \u201cAny unilateral threat or blackmail will only lead to intensification of conflicts and damage to the interests of all parties.\u201d James Knightley of ING agrees the America\u2019s jobs market remains strong, despite July\u2019s slowdown. 2017 averaged 182,000 jobs per month whereas the first 7 months of 2018 have averaged 215,000 job gains. This will help underpin consumer sentiment and spending through the rest of the year. Knightley also believes that Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts will cushion the economy from the ongoing trade disputes. There are certainly worries about protectionism and its potential economic impact, but we also have to remember that the stimulus from tax cuts dwarfs the tax hit from higher tariffs. As such we are still expecting the US economy to expand 3% this year. The US jobs report shows that manufacturers took on 37,000 new staff last month. Construction employment rose by 13,000, while service sector firms provided the bulk of the new jobs. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics explains: We need to be a little careful with the manufacturing number, however, since 13,000 of those jobs were in motor vehicle manufacturing, which is often distorted upwards in July because fewer plants close down for annual retoolings now. Services employment increased by a relatively modest 118,000, although jobs in the better-paid professional &amp; business services increased by 51,000. Despite job creation slowing last month, America\u2019s labo(u)r market still looks fairly robust. As Kully Samra, Vice President at Charles Schwab, points out: Wage growth is steady month on month and unemployment remains near its 18 year low.\u201d However, there are risks on the horizon, including a trade war and the prospect of rising interest rates: Trade isn\u2019t the only cause for concern\u2014investors are also eyeing the rising value of the dollar, slowing global economic growth and the possibility that the Federal Reserve could raise short-term interest rates too much and choke off domestic economic growth. However, US companies have strong balance sheets and tax reform has made it attractive to repatriate even more of their cash from foreign countries. That money can fuel business investment, expansion and stock buybacks. Wall Street isn\u2019t impressed by today\u2019s jobs report: Newsflash: Job creation across America has slowed, while wage growth remains steady Just 157,000 new workers were hired in the US last month, according to the new Non-Farm Payroll. That\u2019s weaker than the 190,000 which Wall Street expected. However, June\u2019s NFP has been revised up to 248,000, from 213,000, with May\u2019s data also better previously thought. The unemployment rate has fallen back to 3.9%, from 4% last month. On the wages front, pay rose by 0.3% in July alone, or 2.7% over the last year. That\u2019s in line with forecasts. Wages were also up 2.7% per year in June, so the tight labour market isn\u2019t still driving up earnings. Reaction to follow.... Newsflash: China has announced plans to impose new retaliatory tariffs on US imports, if America presses on with its trade war. Beijing says it will impose an \u201cimport tax\u201d on around $60bn of American goods, if the US puts taxes on Chinese products. These taxes would range from 5% to 25%, according to Reuters. The Chinese government says the measures are \u201crational and restrained\u201d, will guard its interests, and prevent \u201ctrade frictions from escalating\u201d. This appears to be Beijing\u2019s formal response to America\u2019s plans for tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. Currently, both sides have tariffs on around \u00a338bn of imports. That is already causing pain in the US farming sector, testing Donald Trump\u2019s claims that trade wars are \u201cgood and easy to win\u201d. Here\u2019s a audio clip of Mark Carney speaking this morning, explaining how the UK economy has underperformed since the Brexit vote and why a \u2018no deal\u2019 exit should be avoided if possible: In other financial news, Royal Bank of Scotland took another step towards normality this morning by finally reinstating its dividend. OK, it\u2019s only 2p per share, but it is some relief for long-suffering shareholders who have been waiting a decade for this to happen. The UK taxpayer is one winner, picking up \u00a3149m thanks to the government\u2019s majority stake in the bank. Mark Carney also suggested this morning that UK interest rates could be cut under some Brexit scenarios (a comment he also made yesterday after, err, raising borrowing costs). This is helping to keep the pound close to an 11-month low, says Lee McDarby of foreign exchange firm Moneycorp. Despite the interest rate hike, confidence shown by the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is not being reflected by UK businesses. We\u2019re seeing the Pound trading lower on Carney\u2019s \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit scenario, suggesting that economic uncertainty is still front and centre in the minds of decision-makers. A Hard Brexit might not plunge Britain into a deep recession, but it might lock the country into a long period of weakness. So argues Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale, who predicts that it would hurt (but not sink) the pound: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney says that the chance of a no-deal Brexit is uncomfortably high. That\u2019s a pretty dismal prospect for growth and an awful one for the public finances. It would be bad for the pound but from current low levels, the risk is that we face years of a weak currency rather than another huge move lower.... A \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 which we define as ending access to the single market and taking the UK out of the customs union... is our central case. We think it results in real GDP growth being about 0.5% lower per annum than would have been the case otherwise, for up to 10 years. We think this will result in sterling trading about 5% lower than current levels on a trade-weighted basis in the next few years, back to the 2008 lows, but not to or through the 1976 lows in real terms. For EUR/GBP it suggests a return to levels around 0.95, but not a break of parity. Kit also points out that the pound\u2019s all-time nadir was in 1976, when the government called in the International Monetary Fund to help prop up the nation\u2019s finances. It also plunged on Black Wednesday in 1992, and during the financial crisis. Having tumbled after the 2016 referendum, how much further could the pound slide in 2019 if Brexit goes badly? Kit writes: The question all of this begs, is whether \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 would be worse than 1992, 2008 and 1976. In 1976 and 1992, the UK was coming out of recession (a mild one in 92, a deep one in 1976). In 2009 the UK was in its deepest post-war recession. Today\u2019s 1.2% y/y growth rate is respectable by contrast. Mark Carney\u2019s intervention on Brexit today shows that the Bank of England is getting nervous about the pace and progress of negotiations. As Bloomberg puts it: Mark Carney threw himself back into the thick of the Brexit debate on Friday, saying the chance of the U.K. dropping out of the European Union without a deal is \u201cuncomfortably high.\u201d The intervention suggests the Bank of England governor is growing increasingly worried that Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government is running out of time to hammer out an agreement that will prevent disruption to business, trade and consumers. The central bank has previously drawn criticism for being too forthright in its comments and predictions surrounding Brexit, which anti-EU lawmakers see as being overly gloomy. In a BBC Radio interview on Friday, Carney said a disorderly Brexit is \u201chighly undesirable.\u201d The pound weakened below $1.30 as he spoke and was down 0.3 percent at $1.2982 as of 8:56 a.m. London time. Carney also said that a no-deal Brexit is \u201ca relatively unlikely possibility, but still a possibility.\u201d Mark Carney\u2019s anxiety about Brexit won\u2019t help Britain\u2019s service sector companies recover from their July stumble, says James Knightley of Dutch bank ING. Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s services PMI report: The report compiler cited Brexit worries as a key factor holding back investment. The uncertainty it generates means it\u2019s probable that businesses will become more wary about putting money to work in the UK. Mark Carney\u2019s warning this morning that the risk of a no deal Brexit is \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d isn\u2019t exactly going to help stimulate businesses into action either. The drop in UK service sector growth is disappointing, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. It may suggest that the Bank of England was too hasty when it raised interest rates yesterday. Chris Sood-Nicholls, managing director and head of global services at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says \u201cheadwinds on the horizon\u201d are to blame. The prospect of a rise in interest rates \u2013 confirmed yesterday \u2013 meant that people have been a little more cautious with their spending than they may otherwise have been, while difficulties recruiting staff have also prevented rising demand translating into significant numbers of new jobs. \u201cLike consumers, businesses are generally knuckling down and getting on with what they need to do, while the extent of the uncertainty they face weighs heavily on longer-term investment decisions. \u201cAs a result, although the environment facing services businesses might remain generally positive into next year, they\u2019re unlikely to brush off that cautious approach until they see greater clarity in the mid to long-term.\u201d This is from Rupert Harrison of BlackRock: Services makes up around three quarters of the UK economy, so the drop in growth in July is significant. Another worrying sign: employment growth across the sector fell to a near two-year low. Some companies blamed the tight labour market; others said they were automating business processes so they could run with fewer staff. Newsflash! Britain\u2019s service sector stumbled last month, with growth hitting a three-month low -- and Brexit is getting some of the blame. Service sector bosses report that new orders grew at a slower rate last month, with business activity growth also weakening. This puled down the Markit Service PMI (which measures activity) to 53.5 in July, from 55.1 in June. Some companies blamed \u201cdelayed decision-making and greater risk aversion among clients\u201d due to Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, says the service sector fell back into the \u201cslow lane\u201d last month. While it\u2019s difficult to quantify the precise impact of the recent heat wave on overall business performance, some survey respondents reported that a combination of hot weather and the World Cup had weighed on consumer footfall. These short-term disruptions and a general slowdown in new business growth appear to have offset the boost to tourism-related activity from the extended dry period in July. \u201cLooking at demand fundamentals, service providers commented that Brexit uncertainty had held back new project wins, reflecting risk aversion and a wait-and-see approach to investment spending among international clients. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, also singles out Brexit as a factor: \u201cThe UK services sector experienced a few bumps in the road in July as consumer and client confidence remained persistently half-hearted, and pessimism around the performance of the UK economy along with Brexit concerns lingered. \u201cLevels of new orders and jobs growth were affected along with business optimism which remained below the long-term average even with July\u2019s three-month improvement. Britain\u2019s banking sector would cope if the UK crashed out of the EU without a transition deal, the Bank of England believes. Mark Carney insists that the banks are much stronger than before the financial crash, and could weather a crisis at home or abroad. So even if Britain and Brussels can\u2019t reach a deal, we shouldn\u2019t expect a run on the banks. \u201cThe UK financial system has tripled the amount of capital they had over the course of the last several years, they have increased the amount of liquidity - the money they have on a day-to-day basis - by 10 times over the course of the last several years. \u201cThe reason they have done that is to be in a position to be able to withstand a shock, wherever the shock comes from - it could come from China, it could come from abroad, it could come from a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe have meticulously gone through the types of risk associated with a no-deal Brexit. Mark Carney also warned that a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit would disrupt UK trade, hurting growth: \u201cAs a consequence of that [there would be] a disruption to the level of economic activity, higher prices for a period of time. Newsflash: The pound has slumped close to its lowest level since last September, as the governor of the Bank of England warned that the risks of a hard Brexit are \u201cworryingly high\u201d. Mark Carmey told Radio Four\u2019s Today Programme that it was \u201chighly undesirable\u201d for Britain to crash out of the EU without a deal...but far from impossible. He warned: \u201cI think the possibility of a no deal is uncomfortably high at this point. People will have things to worry about in a no deal Brexit, which is still a relatively unlikely possibility but it is a possibility.\u201d Carney added that a transition deal is \u201cabsolutely\u201d in the interests of both the UK and the EU. He also warned that a \u201cno deal\u201d scenario would drive up consumer prices, as companies scrambled to keep supply chains running. Carney\u2019s comments raise the stakes as prime minister Theresa May prepared to meet with French president Emmanuel Macron, as part of her push to get EU leaders to back her Chequers plan. Macron\u2019s support could be critical to May\u2019s attempts to get Europe to support her compromise proposal. However, EU negotiator Michel Barnier has criticised Chequers - saying the proposal for free movement of goods, but not people, after Brexit would undermine the single market. Carney was also asked about yesterday\u2019s interest rate rise. He said market expectations that rates move to 1.5% over the next few years is \u201cnot a bad rule of thumb.\u201d His comments sent the pound sliding through $1.30 -- it\u2019s down half a cent to $1.2980. That\u2019s uncomfortably close to the 11-month low scraped last month. Hosting the football World Cup gave Russia\u2019s economy a lift. Growth in the Russian service sector jumped in July, according to Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck. It says: The IHS Markit Russia Services Business Activity Index \u2013 a single-figure measure designed to track changes in total Russian services activity \u2013 posted 52.8 in July, up from 52.3 in June. The latest expansion in business activity was solid despite remaining below the long-run series average. Where a rise was reported, panellists linked this to greater new order growth and an increase in activity following the recent football World Cup. China\u2019s service sector growth has hit a four-month low today, suggesting that the trade dispute with America may be hurting. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) fell to 52.8 in July, down from June\u2019s 53.9, and the lowest reading since March. Service sector new orders expanded at their weakest rate for over two-and-a-half years. In another blow, overall business confidence fell to its lowest level since November 2015. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, fears that China\u2019s economy is slowing. The Caixin China Composite Output Index, which covers both manufacturers and service providers, fell to 52.3 in July, pointing to a weaker expansion of China\u2019s economy. The sub- index for prices charged fell more than the one for input costs, although both remained in expansionary territory. The situation pointed to rising cost pressures. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England took a bit of a gamble yesterday, raising UK interest rates to a near 10-year high even though real wage growth is modest and Brexit uncertainty is worrying businesses. Today we learn if the country\u2019s dominant service sector is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs. Data firm Markit is publishing its monthly surveys of purchasing managers from service sector firms (or PMIs). The UK services PMI is expected to fall to 54.7 for July, from 55.1 in June, which would show a small growth slowdown. 2018 has been a torrid year for some services sector firms, such as retailers and restaurants. But some outlets should have enjoyed a World Cup boost last month. Already this week the manufacturing PMI has shown a slowdown, while construction picked up. We also get PMI reports from across the globe. The eurozone figures are expected to confirm that growth slowed last month. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Today\u2019s services PMI for July could well go further in showcasing that the rebound seen in the Q2 numbers isn\u2019t a temporary phenomenon and has momentum. This is expected to show a modest slowdown from June\u2019s 55.1 to 54.7, as the boost from the warm weather and England\u2019s World Cup run came to an end. While we appear to have seen a rebound in the UK economy in Q2, the same can\u2019t be said with any certainty with respect to the EU and France in particular which saw its own GDP come in at 0.2% in Q2. You would think that having won the World Cup that the services sector would show evidence of some sort of pickup in July, but even here expectations are modest in that we could see a slowdown to 55.3. This could be even weaker if the effects of air traffic control and rail strikes caused a bigger loss of output than has originally been estimated. The other major event of the day is the US jobs report, or Non-Farm Payroll. This will show whether America\u2019s long-running labour market boom continued in July. Economists predict that 192,000 new US jobs were created last month, down from 213,000 in June. That could pull the unemployment rate down to just 3.9%, from 4%. The earnings figures are more important. Pay is expected to have risen by 0.3% during the month, up from 0.2% in June. That would leave annual wage increases pegged at 2.7%, not spectacular, given US growth hit its highest level since 2014. We\u2019ll be watching to see whether Donald Trump breaks with protocol (again) and tweets about the jobs number. It would make a nice change from flaming the \u201cfake, disgusting\u201d news.

The UK services PMI is expected to fall to 54.7 for July, from 55.1 in June, which would show a small growth slowdown.</p> <p>2018 has been a torrid year for some services sector firms, such as retailers and restaurants. But some outlets should have enjoyed a World Cup boost last month.</p> <p>Already this week the manufacturing PMI has shown a slowdown, while construction picked up. </p> <p>We also get PMI reports from across the globe. The eurozone figures are expected to confirm that growth slowed last month.</p> <p><strong>Michael Hewson </strong>of <strong>CMC Markets</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Today\u2019s services PMI for July could well go further in showcasing that the rebound seen in the Q2 numbers isn\u2019t a temporary phenomenon</strong> and has momentum. This is expected to show a modest slowdown from June\u2019s 55.1 to 54.7, as the boost from the warm weather and England\u2019s World Cup run came to an end.</p> <p><strong>While we appear to have seen a rebound in the UK economy in Q2</strong>, the same can\u2019t be said with any certainty with respect to the <strong>EU and France in particular which saw its own GDP come in at 0.2% in Q2.</strong> You would think that having won the World Cup that the services sector would show evidence of some sort of pickup in July, but even here expectations are modest in that we could see a slowdown to 55.3. This could be even weaker if the effects of air traffic control and rail strikes caused a bigger loss of output than has originally been estimated.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The other major event of the day is the US jobs report, or Non-Farm Payroll. </strong>This will show whether America\u2019s long-running labour market boom continued in July.<br></p> <p>Economists predict that 192,000 new US jobs were created last month, down from 213,000 in June. That could pull the unemployment rate down to just 3.9%, from 4%.</p> <p>The earnings figures are more important. Pay is expected to have risen by 0.3% during the month, up from 0.2% in June. </p> <p>That would leave annual wage increases pegged at 2.7%, not spectacular, given US growth hit its highest level since 2014.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be watching to see whether Donald Trump breaks with protocol (again) and tweets about the jobs number.

      "bodyText": "William Hill blamed the government\u2019s clampdown on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) as it warned that up to 900 betting shops could close, putting 4,500 jobs at risk. The bookmaker reported a loss of \u00a3820m in the first six months of the year, as the decision to slash maximum stakes on FOBTs from \u00a3100 to \u00a32 forced it to record a \u00a3915m accounting charge. Stripping out the one-off cost, it made a \u00a396m profit, down 13% on last year. The bookmaker warned that the curbs on FOBTs, which the government described as a \u201csocial blight\u201d, would reduce its high street revenues by up to 45%, rendering 38% of its shops unprofitable. It predicted costs of up to \u00a360,000 per shop closure, or more than \u00a350m, with operating profits likely to decrease by up to \u00a3100m a year. Each bookmaker employs about five staff, meaning about 4,500 jobs are at risk if 900 shops close. The gloomy prognosis sent shares in the bookmaker sliding, closing down more than 8% at 287p, the biggest faller on the FTSE 350 on Friday. But William Hill said it had been encouraged by its nascent US operation, which has been growing fast since the supreme court overturned a longstanding ban on sports betting earlier this year. With William Hill\u2019s UK network of high street bookmakers set to shrink, its chief executive, Philip Bowcock, said the company\u2019s US operation could surpass its domestic business. \u201cIn time, yes, depending on regulation, our US business could be bigger than the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US population is seven times that of the UK and they like to gamble more, I think. Gambling is seen as part of everyday life, you\u2019re not a social pariah if you enjoy it.\u201d William Hill announced plans for further expansion in the US, where states are drawing up gambling regulations, mostly demanding that gambling firms do deals with casinos if they want to enter the market. The firm has already struck sports betting deals with 11 casinos in Mississippi and one in West Virginia, giving it a presence in six states, with discussions taking place in 14 more. Bowcock said he believed William Hill was better placed to conquer the US than rivals such as Ladbrokes\u2019 owner GVC, which announced a tie-up with casino owner MGM Resorts earlier this week. He refused to be drawn on whether certainty about FOBTs and US sports betting could trigger a consolidation in which William Hill becomes a buyer or a target, but admitted that \u201ceverybody is talking to everybody\u201d. Ivor Jones, an analyst at broker Peel Hunt, said the company was seizing its US opportunity because it has to, with its UK retail business \u201con life support\u201d. He said: \u201cWilliam Hill is one player among many which hope to profit from the US sports betting market as it develops. \u201cWe forecast a period of intense and expensive competition as new states regulate and success with regulation [multiple states regulating quickly] will lead to a higher spike in competition and startup losses. It will be hard to know the right time to buy into William Hill\u2019s US story, but we are sure this isn\u2019t it.\u201d The company was fined \u00a36.2m by the Gambling Commission in February for failing to protect customers and prevent money laundering. It said it was restructuring its compliance functions and closing a number of customer accounts, which could affect its second-half performance. The regulator had found that 10 customers were able to deposit money linked to criminal offences.",

      "bodyText": "The high street health food chain Holland &amp; Barrett is to open vegan stores as part of a plan to cash in on the increasing number of people who shun all meat and animal products. The chain also aims to take on the Body Shop with a major expansion into cruelty-free beauty. Peter Aldis, the chief executive, said he plans to test two vegan-only stores. They will sell about 1,000 products, including beauty products and foods such as vegan ice cream and sports nutrition powders. With demand on the rise, H&amp;B is seeking to stock 500 more vegan foods this year. Aldis said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel like a place for alternative hippies. We want vegan to become more mainstream and there are lots of very good reasons why it will.\u201d The number of vegans in the UK, who avoid all animal products including dairy and eggs, has grown fourfold in the past 10 years to about 550,000, according to the Vegan Society. Flexitarianism \u2013 where people increasingly choose vegetarian and vegan options, but stop short of completely quitting meat and dairy produce \u2013 is also on the increase. Supermarkets have been quick to supply an increasing range of vegan foods, from \u201cbleeding\u201d burgers to dairy-free ice cream while Waitrose has introduced vegan sections in dozens of stores. In a moribund retail market, beauty is one of the few areas where shoppers are willing to spend more as the selfie generation buffs up for a constant stream of Instagram moments. H&amp;B is facing pressure on profits from dried fruit and nuts, a staple of most health stores, because of soaring commodity prices driven by new demand from China and problems with harvests partly caused by climate change. The world\u2019s biggest beauty firm, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, this week snapped up the German vegan beauty firm Logocos Naturkosmetik. Earlier this year, Superdrug opened a dedicated pop-up store in London to highlight its extensive range of vegan beauty and personal care products The Body Shop founder Anita Roddick stopped animal testing on beauty products in the 1980s, but only half the chain\u2019s products are vegan. Aldis said there was a gap in the beauty market waiting to be filled. \u201cIf she was here now she would be doing this,\u201d Aldis said. Holland &amp; Barrett, which was bought by an investment fund controlled by the Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman last year, has already put vegan nail bars with Zoya vegan polishes in about 50 stores. It also has Beauty Kitchens where customers can mix their own cruelty-free body scrubs. The retailer has also removed beauty products with parabens and foaming agents, which are considered harmful to the environment, and is phasing out gelatin from all its vitamin pills. Aldis said there was much more room for growth, particularly on ethical makeup and other cosmetics. The chain currently stocks only about 50 cosmetics lines in its stores and wants as many as 1,000. Andrew McDougall, a global beauty and personal care analyst at the market researcer Mintel, said: \u201cThe market for vegan products is booming, in line with growing consumer concerns about the ethical and environmental impact of animal-related products and a desire to buy products that align with the issues people care about.\u201d He said the vegan trend was growing fast in fashion and beauty products. According to analysts at NPD, a market research group, UK sales of luxury vegan beauty products climbed 38% last year.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has warned that the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d and will lead to higher prices, as Theresa May prepares to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for talks. The Bank of England governor said both the UK and EU should \u201cdo all things to avoid\u201d a no-deal scenario. He added that the banks had done the \u201cstockpiling\u201d and the country\u2019s financial system was in a position to be able to withstand a shock that could result from the UK leaving the EU without an agreement. His remarks led to sterling falling sharply to just under $1.30. Carney told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think the possibility of a no-deal is uncomfortably high at this point.\u201d Asked if no deal would be a disaster, he said: \u201cIt is highly undesirable. Parties should do all things to avoid it.\u201d Pushed on what no deal would mean, he said \u201cdisruption to trade as we know it\u201d, before adding: \u201cAs a consequence of that, a disruption to the level of economic activity, higher prices for a period of time. \u201cOur job at the Bank of England is to make sure those issues don\u2019t happen in the financial system, so that people will have things to worry about in a no-deal Brexit, which is still a relatively unlikely possibility but it is a possibility, but what we don\u2019t want to have is people worrying about their money in the bank, whether or not they can get a loan from the bank \u2013 whether for a mortgage or for a business idea \u2013 and we have put the banks through the wringer well in advance of this to make sure they have the capital.\u201d But he insisted stress tests ordered by the Bank had ensured that Britain\u2019s financial institutions, which have tripled their capital and increased their liquidity by 10 times, would be able to cope. \u201cThe reason they have done that is to be in the position to be able to withstand a shock, wherever the shock comes from. It could come from China; it could come from abroad; it could come from a no-deal Brexit.\u201d May will meet Macron at his summer retreat, Fort de Br\u00e9gan\u00e7on, on a small island off the French Mediterranean coast, on Friday evening. After the talks, she and her husband, Philip, will join Macron and his wife, Brigitte, for a private dinner. May is ending her break in the Italian Lakes a day early in the hope of winning over the French leader, one of Europe\u2019s key powerbrokers, although she will fly off to Switzerland for a second break later this month. Warnings about a potential collapse in talks between the EU and the UK government have been escalating in recent days. During a trip to Austria on Wednesday, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the process was \u201cheading for no deal by accident\u201d. Earlier, Gen Sir Nick Carter, the new head of the armed forces, was asked about reports the army was being put on standby for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 a situation in which troops could help deliver food, medicines and fuel. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any request yet as far as I\u2019m aware,\u201d he said",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is to pay its first dividend since its \u00a345bn bailout by the UK government during the financial crisis a decade ago. The bank will pay an interim dividend of 2p a share once its provisional $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice is finalised, ending an investigation into sales of mortgage-backed products. The dividend is worth \u00a3240m and the Treasury will receive \u00a3149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. RBS reported an operating profit before tax of \u00a31.8bn for the first half of this year after taking an \u00a3801m litigation and conduct charge, down from a \u00a31.95bn profit a year earlier. The firm posted its first annual profit in a decade in February. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said RBS\u2019s results were another sign the country was moving beyond the financial crisis. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said: \u201cThe turnaround of the bank is almost complete.\u201d RBS\u2019s chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, described the dividend as \u201cmodest\u201d but said payouts to shareholders would increase \u201cmaterially from here\u201d. The bank intends to raise dividend payouts to 40% of earnings by 2020 and will also look at the possibility of share buybacks next year, although McEwan cautioned that Brexit could derail big payouts to investors. He struck a cautious tone, saying the uncertainty around Brexit \u2013 only eight months away \u2013 was bearing down on the economy, which was growing at the slowest rate in nearly a decade. While writedowns on bad loans are low at present, they are expected to tick up; and the hugely competitive mortgage market is putting pressure on the bank\u2019s interest margins, he said. Stevenson is leaving to become the finance chief at HSBC. The RBS chairman, Howard Davies, sought to squash speculation that more departures could be imminent after RBS\u2019s latest milestone, saying: \u201cRoss and I are going nowhere.\u201d The resumption of dividend payments paves the way for further share sales. The government reduced its stake in the bank by almost 8% in June for \u00a32.5bnbut Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was forced to defend the move as the sale left taxpayers nursing a \u00a32.1bn loss. The shares were sold at 271p each, much lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago. RBS shares were up 3% to 257.6p by mid-afternoon on Friday. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cRBS has made tremendous progress in addressing legacy issues over the past 12 months such that it is now in a position to resume dividend payments and plan additional capital distributions to shareholders. Despite this positive progress, the shares have been weak of late and are beginning to look more interesting to us.\u201d RBS is setting up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam with 150 staff for its NatWest Markets arm and is getting ready to move customers over. Davies said the firm was not a very large player in continental Europe and \u201cnot very anxious\u201d about the risks of a no-deal Brexit. He thought banks overall could cope, although a transition deal would make life easier. Alasdair McKinnon, the lead fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in RBS, said: \u201cThe dividend reinstatement is an important milestone for RBS \u2013 it marks the beginning of the end for a decade-long rehabilitation. Having been the poster child for banking failure, RBS is now well on its way to becoming a \u2018normal\u2019 bank.\u201d",
