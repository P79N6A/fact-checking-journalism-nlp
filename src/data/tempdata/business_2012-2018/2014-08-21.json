      "bodyText": "Burberry chief executive Christopher Bailey has sold \u00a35.2m of shares in the luxury fashion company, four months after taking over from predecessor Angela Ahrendts. Bailey has offloaded 68,667 shares and nearly three quarters of two sets of performance related shares granted in 2011 and 2009 when he was the company's chief creative officer and which recently vested. It is understood that nearly half of the shares granted under the performance related schemes were sold to cover taxes. Of the remainder, half were retained and half were cashed out. Bailey now owns 303,110 shares in the company worth \u00a34.4m, 13% more than he owned prior to receiving the share awards. The company said: \"Christopher Bailey has exercised the option on a number of shares that he was awarded during his time as chief creative officer. As part of this process the number of Burberry shares he actually owns has increased. There are only certain times of the year when board members of a public company can sell shares which is why he is doing this now.\" The sale comes at a sensitive time after shareholders last month slapped down the company for handing Bailey share awards worth \u00a320m \u2013 which he will begin to receive from next year. At Burberry's annual shareholder meeting in London, 52.7% of investor votes opposed the brand's pay report which laid out details of the share awards to Bailey which had no performance targets attached. He is also in line for a potential one-off performance-related award of shares worth \u00a37.6m, set outas part of his pay deal on promotion in May \u2013 in addition to his \u00a31m salary and potential \u00a32m annual bonus. Chairman John Peace said at the annual general meeting: \"We know the amount paid to Christopher is a lot of money but much of it is performance-related and he will receive it only if Burberry performs strongly.\" Burberry argued last month that Bailey's pay is in line with other luxury-goods companies. Prada's Miuccia Prada reportedly earned \u00a311.7m in 2013. Asked at the AGM whether he would return some of the shares, Bailey said: \"It's not about giving something up. It is not something I made the decision on, it is the remuneration committee and the chairman and the board.\" Asked about the step up from chief creative officer to chief executive, he said: \"I was never sitting there with a pencil drawing clothes. It's about having a vision and leading the team and ensuring consistency around the globe.\" Burberry, which dates back to 1856, has traditionally been known for its classic trench coats but has widened its appeal as a luxury brand using celebrity models such as Cara Delevingne and Emma Watson in its advertising campaigns.",

Coupled with a decline in base salaries, total compensation packages are down almost \u00a31m to \u00a3660,000. The details from Emolument.com, a company that analyses salary rates, show there has been huge volatility in what hedge fund professionals are paid, although the most acute changes have been among the high earners.

Despite the sharp year on year decline in their overall packages, partners and managing directors still earn almost three times what mid-ranking employees take home.

Wood, the billionaire founder of Wood Group, the Aberdeen-based oil services company, would be expected to have a reliable grasp of the real figures and has just completed a review for the UK government on how to maximise the remainder of Britain's oil reserves. The Scottish National party has repeatedly predicted that the amount of UK North Sea oil and gas reserves, of which about 91% are located in Scottish waters according to the SNP, amounts to 24bn barrels of oil equivalents. Based on this number, Alex Salmond has talked of \u00a31.5tn of value that could be used to create jobs, tax returns and other benefits to the people of a newly independent Scotland. Wood said on Wednesday, however, that the \"best outcome\" would be between 15bn and 16.5bn barrels and that would depend on a new government in Holyrood offering more generous tax terms to oil explorers. The respected industrialist argued that rather than the \u00a37bn worth of tax a year that the SNP expected, the true figure was more likely to be \u00a35bn. Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor and head of the pro-union Better Together campaign, said Wood's analysis \"blows apart Alex Salmond's plans for funding schools and hospitals\". The picture on oil wealth has already been made more cloudy by figures just released by the Scottish government itself showing that the North Sea tax take for 2013-14 was \u00a34bn, half the level anticipated by the SNP. Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted recoverable reserves at 10bn barrels and forecast North Sea revenues of \u00a361.6bn between 2013-14 and 2040-41. The Office for National Statistics had earlier estimated the value of untapped reserves to the UK Treasury to be closer to \u00a3120bn. And yet as recently as this week a Scottish business thinktank, N-56, said the figure could be as high as \u00a3365bn, if a series of new policy recommendations were implemented. Amid such confusion, voters may struggle to base their decision on the oil question next month. Salmond, a former oil economist himself, batted away challenges from his political opponents at parliamentary question time in Edinburgh about the Wood analysis. He insisted that the 24bn was a \"robust figure\" supported by many others in the oil and gas industry. But even the SNP admits that the 24bn \"encompasses proven, probable and possible reserves \u2026 as well as further exploration\". The party has also admitted its \u00a31.5tn financial benefits figure is dependent on oil prices remaining above $100 (\u00a360) a barrel. Sceptics use these caveats to warn of uncertainties and variables in the SNP's case. But there is also the issue of how much of that extra wealth is retained by Scotland. Research by the Guardian has shown that oil \u2013 like financial services, whisky and other business sectors in Scotland \u2013 is dominated by companies with headquarters outside the country. But oil and gas reserve figures are notoriously slippery themselves. Whether operators can exploit 10bn, 15bn or 24bn barrels will depend on a wide range of factors, from geology to tax to currency exchange rates to an ever-changing oil price. Many of these factors are outside Scotland's control. John Busby, an independent energy consultant, argues that the barrel of oil equivalent numbers used by the SNP and others are largely meaningless. \"The only value is really attached to recoverable reserves \u2013 oil or gas that can definitely be got out economically. Those are the only numbers that are recognised [when assessing oil company values] by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US.\" He points out that BP, in its annual statistical review, puts the amount of recoverable reserves in Britain at 3bn barrels and says the fast rundown of oil and gas output suggests there is a problem looming for the UK, never mind Scotland. In his words: \"We are in a pickle.\" The main thrust of the Wood review into future oil revenues was how to halt the decline in North Sea production. On Thursday Wood went further, telling the website Energy Voice that it would be only 15 years before a calamitous drop-off in hydrocarbon wealth hit the UK. the SNP tried to turn the oil debate in favour of the independence camp by releasing a document highlighting the way past revenues had been frittered away by the UK government rather than spent on building a fund to benefit future generations \u2013 as Norway had done. Fergus Ewing, Scotland's energy minister, said: \"By grabbing the independence opportunity next month we can emulate Norway's example, instead of putting up with yet more mismanagement and poor stewardship of this vital resource.\" The scale of that resource will still be a subject of debate come 18 September. Scotland's energy wealth: the competing figures On 18 September voters who are asked the question \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" will struggle to base their answer on the scale of the country's oil and gas wealth. It is an important factor in judging the strength of an independent Scottish economy, but there are differing figures over the scale and longevity of that wealth. They are: \u2022 The Office of Budget Responsibility, the advisory public body established by the UK government to provide \"independent\" economic advice, believes there are 10bn barrels of oil or gas reserves left on the UK continental shelf, predominantly within Scottish waters. \u2022 Sir Ian Wood, founder and former chairman of the Aberdeen-based global oil services firm Wood Group, believes that there are more likely to be between 15bn and 16.5bn barrels. \u2022 The Scottish National Party, using information provided by leading petroleum economist Alex Kemp from Aberdeen University, argues there are 24bn barrels in place in the North Sea.",

One-off factors such as income shifting in response to the reduction in the additional rate of income tax and last year\u2019s Swiss capital tax proceeds depressed receipts growth in the early part of the financial year. </p> <p>Other factors such as the end-loading of SA payments will boost receipts in January and February next year.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Here\u2019s a recap: Private sector growth across the eurozone has slowed this month, bringing job creation to a standstill and dampening hopes that Europe\u2019s weak economy will rebound robustly from its recent stagnation. The latest monthly index of purchasing managers (PMI), from data firm Markit, found that France\u2019s economy continues to struggle. French manufacturing activity is falling at its fastest rate in 15 months. Growth in the country\u2019s service sector did pick up, but the overall French private sector is flatlining after shrinking for the last three months. The composite PMI for the eurozone fell to a two-month low of 52.8 this month, down from 53.8 in July. Factory output weakened, with the eurozone manufacturing PMI falling to a 13-month low of 50.8, closer to the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Firms also reported that job creation had slowed to near-stagnation in August, suggesting that progress in cutting eurozone unemployment is stalling..... Full story: Slowdown in eurozone growth cools hopes that economy will bounce back Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics summed up the mood: The survey added to signs that the euro-zone\u2019s feeble recovery is already over, increasing pressure on the ECB to do more to support the flagging economy even as other central banks start to tighten monetary policy. The eurozone has also been hit by a drop in consumer confidence. Chinese factory growth has slowed to a three-month low, with new-order growth dropping. Hongbin Qu, HSBC\u2019s chief economist for China, said Beijing should supply more policy support to help consolidate the recovery. But America\u2019s factory sector appears to be growing strongly this month: the US manufacturing PMI jumped to 58.0, the highest reading since April 2010, as companies put last winter\u2019s slowdown behind them. In the UK, the government has insisted that it is on track to hit its deficit reduction targets. July\u2019s public finances were weaker than expected; a deficit of \u00a3200m means that the UK has borrowed \u00a31.8bn more so far this year than in April-July 2013. British retail sales growth has slowed, as price wars between supermarkets drive down the cost of food. And Bank of America is paying almost $17bn to settle charges it sold flawed mortgage securities in the run up to the financial crisis - a record amount. Thanks, and good night. GW Here\u2019s our story about Bank of America\u2019s record-breaking settlement deal: Bank of America reaches record $17bn settlement over questionable mortgages European stock markets have just closed higher, helped by the strong economic data from the US and speculation that the weak European surveys will prompt fresh stimulus from the ECB. The German Dax is up almost 1%, France\u2019s CAC gained 1.2%, while the FTSE 100 is up a more modest 0.26%, or 13 points. David Madden of IG explains: In London, the FTSE 100 eked out a small gain as a lack of negative news from Eastern Europe and a string of positive updates from the US have brightened the mood; the eurozone stock markets are benefiting the most from the improved relationship with Moscow. The unimpressive services and manufacturing data from the eurozone is fuelling speculation that the European Central Bank will loosen its monetary policy this side of Christmas. Some afternoon reading -- this piece by Matt O\u2019Brien of the Washington Post makes a powerful case that Europe\u2019s economy really is in trouble: Worse than the 1930s: Europe\u2019s recession is really a depression Written before today\u2019s economic data, it explains how policy failures and the restrictions of the single currency have made the eurozone \u201cone of the biggest catastrophes in economic history\u201d. Here\u2019s a flavour: Just like the 1930s, Europe is stuck with a fixed exchange system that doesn\u2019t let them print, spend, or devalue their way out of a crisis. But, unlike then, Europe might never give it up. It\u2019s a fidelity to failure that even the gold bloc couldn\u2019t have imagined. And that leaves the ECB as Europe\u2019s only hope\u2014which means they\u2019re probably doomed. Now, to be fair, the Draghi-led ECB has done about as much as it can given its legal and political constraints. But you don\u2019t grade unemployment on a curve. And those constraints aren\u2019t going to go away, not enough anyway, to avoid a lost decade or two. Instead, the ECB will probably keep doing the bare minimum: some half-hearted quantitative easing that will stop as soon as Germany starts to grow faster. They have made a desert, and called it the eurozone.... Today\u2019s economic data underlines how the eurozone has fallen further behind the US. Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics says the slowdown in the factory sector suggests geopolitics is hurting Europe: The manufacturing index suffered the sharpest decline, from 52.7 to 50.9, suggesting that the Russia-Ukraine crisis is having a greater impact on confidence and activity than direct trade links alone might imply. In any event, the survey added to signs that the euro-zone\u2019s feeble recovery is already over, increasing pressure on the ECB to do more to support the flagging economy even as other central banks start to tighten monetary policy. Note that the flash estimate of the EC\u2019s measure of consumer confidence in August was also weaker than expected. In another blow to the eurozone, consumer confidence in the region has fallen to a six-month low. The EU\u2019s index of consumer morale fell to minus 10.0 in August, dropping from July\u2019s minus 8.4 to the lowest level since February. Confidence also dipped across the wider EU, from minus 5.5 to minus 6.4%. The Ukraine crisis may have hit sentiment, as Russia and the West hit each other with sanctions. The weak growth figures in the second quarter of 2014 may also be a factor - with France stagnating, Germany contracting by 0.2%, and Italy falling back into recession. Two more upbeat pieces of US data have also been announced, as fastFT explains: Existing home sales climbed 2.4 per cent last month, putting activity at its strongest since October, the National Association of Realtors said. Separately, a measure of manufacturing around the Philadelphia area expanded at the fastest pace since early 2011. An index from the Reserve Bank of Philadelphia climbed to 28, up from 23.9 and the strongest reading since March 2011. More here: US housing, manufacturing data tops forecasts Just in: activity in America\u2019s factory sector has surged at the fastest rate in over four years, outpacing Europe\u2019s weak economy The flash manufacturing purchasing managers index has jumped to a reading of 58.0 in August from 55.8 in July to reach the highest level since April 2010. Firms reported a steep rise in production, and in new work, suggesting the sector enjoyed robust growth. Here are the key points from Markit:\uf0a7 Manufacturing PMI rebounds sharply from July\u2019s three-month low Output and new orders both rise at faster rates New export business increases at steepest pace for three years Employment growth accelerates to strongest since March 2013 Markit economist Tim Moore adds: \u201cOverall, with job hiring gathering momentum and input buying expanding at the sharpest pace for at least seven years, it seems US manufacturers are increasingly confident that the recovery is firmly back on track and are gearing up for a sustained rebound in production schedules over the months ahead.\u201d A much rosier picture than in France, where factory activity shrank at its fastest rate in over a year. Eric Holder, United States Attorney General, is telling reporters that the $16.65bn settlement with Bank of America is \u201cthe largest civil settlement with a single entity in history.\u201d Breaking: Bank of America has reached a $16.65bn settlement with US regulators including the Department of Justice. This will resolve charges that it mis-sold mortgage products in the lead-up to the financial crisis. It is paying a cash penalty of $9.65bn, and an additional $7bn in relief to consumers. Just in - the number of new Americans signing on for unemployment benefit fell by 14,000 last week, to 298,000. Economists had expected a 12,000 drop. And the number of \u2018continued claims\u2019 (people who\u2019ve been on the list for at least a week) hit a seven-year low of 2.500 million. Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has now weighed in on this morning\u2019s UK public finances, which showed a \u00a3223m deficit last month. They point out that the UK often manages to keep its budget in surplus in July, as corporation tax and self-assessment payments often land during this month. This time, though, underlying borrowing reached \u00a3800m. The OBR cites one factor: Corporation tax was down 4.8 per cent on a year earlier in July, primarily because of a fall in receipts from oil and gas firms. The watchdog also warned that Britain\u2019s weak earnings growth (real wages are still shrinking, remember) means that income tax and national insurance payments could suffer. The OBR explains: Higher borrowing so far this year largely reflects weak receipts growth. One-off factors such as income shifting in response to the reduction in the additional rate of income tax and last year\u2019s Swiss capital tax proceeds depressed receipts growth in the early part of the financial year. Other factors such as the end-loading of SA payments will boost receipts in January and February next year. In addition, weaker-than-expected wage growth so far in 2014-15 is likely to affect PAYE and NIC receipts. And that could leave George Osborne with less wriggle-room for cuts or giveaways in next March\u2019s pre-election budget, perhaps. Here\u2019s the full commentary from the OBR We started the morning with disappointing Chinese factory growth data, from HSBC/Markit. This chart from Reuters\u2019 Eric Beebo shows that activity has bobbed around the 50-point no-change mark for some time: City firm Panmure Gordon is concerned that today\u2019s public finance figures show the UK borrowing \u00a31.8bn more this year than last year (so far). But there are encouraging signs for the future, they argue: There is, however, some emerging evidence of a recent pick-up in tax receipts as strong economic growth begins to be reflected in higher tax receipts. Given strong economic growth is expected to continue into the second half of the year, we see the picture for UK public finances gradually improving \u2013 this in turn will give the Chancellor more leeway to consider a pre-election tax cut in the November Autumn Statement. As flagged earlier, though, it\u2019s VAT and stamp duty that are up, rather than corporation tax receipts... A reminder of how far Britain remains from George Osborne\u2019s original goal of eliminating the deficit by 2015..... And here\u2019s Labour\u2019s response to the UK public sector borrowing figures: Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cToday\u2019s public borrowing figures confirm that George Osborne is set to break his promise to balance the books by next year*, and on top of that so far this year he has borrowed \u00a337 billion - more than the same period last year. \u201cBorrowing is now expected to be almost \u00a3190 billion more than planned under this government. This is the cost of three damaging years of flatlining and falling living standards we have seen since the election. Labour will balance the books and get the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next Parliament. And we will we will do so more fairly by reforming our economy for the long-term and reversing David Cameron\u2019s top rate tax cut for the top one per cent of earners and we will act to secure a strong and balanced recovery that delivers rising living standards for the many, not just a few at the top.\u201d * - That target was actually abandoned a couple of year back, when it was clear that the UK economy was struggling (due to a combination of Osborne\u2019s Plan A austerity, and the eurozone crisis, as economics editor Larry Elliott reminded us last week) The UK Treasury insists that the UK is on track to hit its deficit reduction target, despite actually borrowing \u00a31.8bn more this year than last year (see 10.27am for details and the key chart). A spokesperson says: Today\u2019s Public Sector Net Borrowing figures continue to be in line with the budget forecast which predicts the deficit to have halved by the end of this year. But the job is not yet done which is why we must continue to work through the plan that is building a resilient economy. It does appear that the public finance figures are being distorted by one-off effects last year (proceeds from a tax avoidance deal with Switzerland, and \u201cbehavioural changes\u201d following the cut in the top rate of tax). These charts, from the Independent\u2019s Ben Chu, underline how UK corporation tax receipts have lagged VAT and national insurance since the start of the financial crisis: Despite Britain\u2019s economic recovery, the UK government continue to borrow to balance the books. The latest public finances show that the UK ran up a deficit of over \u00a3200m in July, or \u00a3800m if all temporary and one-off factors are stripped out. Either way, it\u2019s around \u00a3800m less than a year ago, but it dashes hopes of a small surplus last month. Britain has now borrowed \u00a337bn since the start of April, once you strip out the profits on the Bank of England\u2019s quantitative easing programme, and the impact of taking the Royal Mail pension fund into public hands. That\u2019s \u00a31.8bn more than in April-July 2013. As this chart shows, that\u2019s not the great start towards the government\u2019s plan to lower the deficit in 2014-15. The figures also show that tax revenues from consumer spending, share trading and house sales all rose, while corporation tax receipts fell compared to a year ago. VAT receipts increased by \u00a30.4 billion (or 3.9%) to \u00a310.3 billion, income tax related payments increased by \u00a30.8 billion (or 5.1%) to \u00a317.4 billion, Stamp duties (on shares, land &amp; property) increased by \u00a30.1 billion (or 11.7%) to \u00a31.3 billion, while corporation tax decreased by \u00a30.3 billion (or 4.8%) to \u00a36.6 billion. The weak UK retail sales growth (details here) will send concern rippling through the sector, says Keith Richardson of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Richardson agrees that grocers are driving down prices. He also cited England\u2019s disappointing performance at the Brazil World Cup; fans had little no excuse to celebrate with a shopping binge. He says: \u201cA second successive month of weak sales figures will cause concern throughout the sector. Retailers will hope the slowdown in sales is a temporary blip rather than a prolonged decline in consumer confidence. \u201cThe contrasting fortunes of the food and non-food sectors was more pronounced during July. Non-food retailers, especially those operating in clothing, footwear and home improvement sectors, were boosted by a prolonged spell of good weather and a buoyant housing market. \u201cHowever, food sales continue to struggle. Grocery retailers are in the midst of a price war with everyday low prices being the main strategy for both mainstream and discount operators. While this approach has benefited consumers, the reduction in the value of goods sold will continue to have a detrimental impact on total retail sales during the forthcoming months. England\u2019s early exit from the World cup also deprived the grocery sector of a much needed fillip.\u201d Retail sales growth across the UK has slowed last month, despite shops cutting prices as supermarkets fight for customers. The Office for National Statistics reports that retail sales volumes crept up by just 0.1% in July, compared with June. The average prices of goods sold in July 2014 compared with July 2013 showed deflation of 0.9%, the ONS added. Food stores were the only sector to show an increase in prices (0.2%). It also found that the amount of money that Britons spent in food stores fell by 1.3% year-on-year in July, the first drop since records began in 1989. Growth among eurozone\u2019s private firms is slowing this month, and at a faster rate than expected, as the region\u2019s factories struggle. Activity across the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors both grew at a slower rate so far this month, data firm Markit reports. It said the eurozone recovery remains \u201csubdued and fragile\u201d, meaning job creation across the area came to a near stand-still this month. Markit added: Economic and geopolitical uncertainties, alongside the continuing need to maintain cost competiveness, are also acting as brakes on job creation. Markit\u2019s monthly PMI survey (which polls purchasing managers across the region), showed that manufacturing activity grew at the weakest rate in over a year: As covered earlier in this blog, German firms reported solid growth while France\u2019s private sector stabilised, with service sector expansion countered by yet another drop in factory output. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, says the recovery still hasn\u2019t taken hold in Europe. \u201cThe eurozone economy continued to make steady progress in August, as the region looks to bounce back following the recent weaker-than-expected GDP readings for the currency union. \u201cHowever, with the PMI Output Index slipping slightly to 52.8, the region remains on course to register growth of only around 0.3%-0.4% in the third quarter, a level that is unlikely to stimulate any real turnaround in the labour market. \u201cEven before rising geopolitical headwinds began to buffet the economy, the double-digit unemployment rate prevailing in the eurozone was already excessively high. Signs are that the modest job creation of recent months has stalled in August. \u201cThere are some positive points coming out of the national data, however, with Germany recording solid growth and France stabilising following a brief period of contraction. Further progress was also made outside of the big-two economies, although signs that output and new order growth slowed sharply over the month adds a cautionary note for the outlook in the periphery\u201f. Today\u2019s PMI report also shows that German firms are less optimistic -- some cited the looming introduction of a national minimum wage. But Markit is confident that Germany is returning to growth after shrinking in the last quarter. Economist Oliver Kolodseike says: \u201cAugust\u2019s flash results provide further encouraging news for Germany\u2019s private sector, with output and new orders rising sharply. The PMI data available for the third quarter so far point to a swift recovery in GDP from the ground lost during the second quarter. \u201cHowever, the concern is the divergent trends within the economy, with the manufacturing sector losing further momentum. Production growth was the weakest in over a year and employment was cut for the third month running. Services is meanwhile taking up some of the weakness in manufacturing, highlighted by sharp increases in business activity and new orders.\u201d The full report is online here. Once again, Germany\u2019s companies are performing better than their French counterparts. Growth in Germany\u2019s private sector is easing this month, Markit reports, with factory bosses reporting a significant slowdown. But the Germany economy still appears to be enjoying robust growth this quarter, having suffered an unexpected 0.2% contraction in April-June. In its new health check of the German economy, just released, Markit reports that \u201coutput growth has slowed slightly as manufacturing loses momentum.\u201d Some companies said they are suffering from \u201cbottlenecks\u201d in the goods producing sector. But Germany\u2019s service sector appears to be on a roll. New orders are up this month, at the fastest rate in nine months. And private firms continue to take on staff -- in a stark contrast with France where people are being laid off at a faster rate (see 8.18am). Markit says: August\u2019s survey results signalled a further round of job creation in Germany\u2019s private sector, extending the current period of employment growth to 10 months. The latest increase in staffing levels was the weakest in five months. Some companies hired additional workers in response to higher order intakes. Reaction to follow.... Today\u2019s PMI report suggests the French economy is still stagnating, having failed to grow for the last six months. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, explains: \u201cModest expansion in France\u2019s dominant service sector masked ongoing weakness in manufacturing during August. Overall, the data point to quarterly GDP tracking around stagnation in the third quarter, continuing the flat trend seen since the turn of the year. \u201cAn acceleration in the rate of job cutting combined with ebbing business confidence in the service sector during August offers little to suggest that the economy is set to snap out of its sluggish performance any time soon.\u201d The full report is online here. This chart shows the latest worrying increase in workers being laid off: France\u2019s manufacturing sector is continuing to contract, dragging back private sector growth in Europe\u2019s second largest economy. The flash French manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity across French factories sector, slipped to a 15-month low in August. That indicates that the sector is shrinking at a faster pace this month. The data was just released by Markit. In better news, it also reported that the French service sector is growing this month -- meaning the overall private sector had \u201cstabilised in August\u201d, having contracted in recent months. But France\u2019s unemployment problems appear to be worsening, with firms cutting staff at a faster rate: Employment in the French private sector fell for a tenth consecutive month in August. Moreover, the rate of job shedding quickened to the fastest since February. Lower staffing levels were recorded in the services and manufacturing sectors, with the latter posting the steeper decline. This graph tracks the PMI (in blue) against French GDP (which has not grown this year). Here\u2019s the details. Any reading below 50 indicates a contraction, while a &gt;50 reading shows growth. Flash France Composite Output Index rises to 50.0 (49.4 in July), 4-month high Flash France Services Activity Index rises to 51.1 (50.4 in July), 5-month high Flash France Manufacturing Output Index rises to 45.4 (45.2 in July), 2-month high Flash France Manufacturing PMI falls to 46.5 (47.8 in July), 15-month low Reaction to follow... Zhu Qibing, economist at Minzu Securities, agrees that Beijing\u2019s government will need take more stimulus measures in the face of a slowing economy, but doesn\u2019t expect monetary stimulus: \u201cDefinitely there will be more measures to keep growth momentum steady in coming months. \u201cBut we don\u2019t expect interest rate cuts in the near term as the central bank has reiterated that it would keep its prudent monetary policy unchanged.\u201d Last night\u2019s hawkish minutes from the Federal Reserve have pushed up the US dollar, and driven the gold price down 1.6% to a 2-month low of $1,278 per ounce. Gold has already fallen for the last four days running, partly due to the strengthening US dollar. Dutch financial group Rabobank has added to concerns that the Ukraine crisis could hurt the European economy. It warned this morning that sanctions imposed on Russia could have an \u201cadverse effect\u201d on its customers, and could therefore adversely hurt its own performance. Fears that the Chinese economy is faltering have been fanned by new manufacturing data overnight, showing that growth has dropped to the lowest rate since May. Output and new orders across its huge factory sector have both slowed in August, suggesting the economy has softened. And companies laid off staff at a faster rate, according to HSBC and Markit\u2019s monthly report. The HSBC/Markit Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) fell to 50.3 from July\u2019s 18-month high of 51.7. That was some way short of analyst forecasts of 51.5, and close to the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction. Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China at HSBC, says the data suggests the momentum of China\u2019s recovery has slowed, adding; \u201cWe think more policy support is needed to help consolidate the recovery. Both monetary and fiscal policy should remain accommodative until there is a more sustained rebound in economic activity.\u201d Here\u2019s the full breakdown, showing how growth slowed -- and that prices also dropped (suggesting deflationary pressure are growing too). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re about to get a fresh health-check on the eurozone economy, and it may not be too cheering. It\u2019s that time of the month when Markit, the data provider, gives its first estimate at how companies across the globe are faring. And economists expect to hear that France\u2019s private sector is still struggling, pulling back the wider eurozone economy. The French manufacturing PMI (or Purchasing Managers Index) is expected to show another contraction, while its service sector may manage a little growth. It\u2019s released at 8am BST. Germany\u2019s private firms are expected to have performed better (data at 8.30am), but Markit could still report a slowing in private sector growth across the eurozone compared with July, at 9am. That would be worrying, given the eurozone recovery hit the rails in the last quarter, failing to grow at all. In the UK, we get new public sector borrowing figures, for July, and the latest retail sales data too. There\u2019ll be American data too -- the weekly jobless data, and Markit\u2019s first stab at the US manufacturing PMI for August. Elsewhere today.... the European markets are digesting the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest monetary policy committee meeting, released last night. They were more hawkish than expected, showing that Fed policymakers discussed how to communicate a future rate rise. I\u2019m afraid it looks rather quiet otherwise -- the summer lull is upon us. But I\u2019ll be tracking the key developments through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Bank of America has agreed to pay a record $16.65bn to settle charges it sold flawed mortgage securities in the run up to the financial crisis, the largest fine ever levied by US authorities on a single company. \u201cThis morning we demonstrate once again that no institution is either too big or too powerful to escape appropriate enforcement action by the department of justice. At nearly $17bn, this resolution with Bank of America is the largest the department has ever reached with a single entity in American history,\u201d associate attorney general Tony West said at a press conference on Thursday. The bank will pay $9.65bn in cash to the Justice Department, six US states, and other government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A further $7bn in aid will go to consumers struggling with home loan payments and towards demolishing derelict properties. John Coffee, Adolf A Berle professor of law at Columbia University, said: \u201cThere is another shoe that needs to drop before we can assess this settlement. This is the largest fine but yet again we have seen an inability, or a reluctance, to name and go after the individuals responsible.\u201d The settlement comes as US prosecutors are preparing a civil lawsuit against Angelo Mozilo, co-founder of Countrywide Financial, the largest subprime mortgage lender ahead of the financial crisis. Bank of America bought Countrywide for $2.5bn in 2008 and has since paid tens of billions in fines related to its activities. The Justice Department\u2019s fine comes after a series of similar deals over the mortgage-related conduct of major US banks ahead of the crisis. In July, Citigroup paid $7bn to settle its case and last November JP Morgan Chase agreed to a then record $13bn to end an investigation that alleged it routinely overstated the quality of mortgages it was selling to investor. Many of Bank of America\u2019s issues stemmed from loans originated by Countrywide and packaged and sold to investors by Merrill Lynch, which the bank also bought in 2008. But the Justice Department also found problems with Bank of America\u2019s own mortgage securities. \u201cBank of America has acknowledged that, in the years leading up to the financial crisis that devastated our economy in 2008, it, Merrill Lynch and Countrywide sold billions of dollars of RMBS [residential mortgage-backed securities] backed by toxic loans whose quality and level of risk they knowingly misrepresented to investors and the US government,\u201d attorney general Eric Holder said. In three separate investigations conducted in the western district of North Carolina, the central district of California and New Jersey, the department found that Merrill Lynch knew, \u201cbased on its own due diligence, that substantial numbers of the loans it was packaging into RMBS and selling to investors failed to meet underwriting guidelines, did not comply with the applicable law, or were inadequately collateralized \u2013 all contrary to representations Merrill was making to investors,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like going to your neighborhood grocery store to buy milk advertised as fresh, only to discover that store employees knew the milk you were buying had been left out on the loading dock, unrefrigerated, the entire day before, yet they never told you,\u201d said West. At the press conference, dominated by questions about Holder\u2019s visit to Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, West said the Justice Department reserves the right to file further charges against individuals or criminal charges. \u201cWe have many tools in our tool box,\u201d said West. He said civil charges could be very effective because of the \u201clower burden of proof. That does not preclude us being able to use other tools in our tool box,\u201d he said. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the US attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles is preparing a lawsuit against Mozilo, 75, the former chief executive of mortgage lender Countrywide, and up to 10 other employees. Mozilo paid a $67.5m penalty to the SEC in 2010 to settle charges that he misled Countrywide investors about the quality of loans being underwritten at the company. He earned $535m from 1999 to 2008, according to compensation-research firm Equilar Inc. \u201cThere is no sound basis, in law or fact, for the government to bring a claim against Mr Mozilo,\u201d David Siegel, Mozilo\u2019s lawyer, told Reuters in an email. \u201cWe believe this settlement, which resolves significant remaining mortgage-related exposures, is in the best interests of our shareholders, and allows us to continue to focus on the future,\u201d said Bank of America\u2019s chief executive officer Brian Moynihan. The bank said the settlement will cut third-quarter pretax earnings by $5.3bn, or 43 cents per share after tax.",

      "bodyText": "Private sector growth across the eurozone has slowed this month, bringing job creation to a standstill and dampening hopes that Europe's weak economy will rebound robustly from its recent stagnation. The latest monthly index of purchasing managers (PMI), from data firm Markit, found that France's economy continues to struggle. French manufacturing activity is falling at its fastest rate in 15 months. Growth in the country's service sector picked up, but the overall French private sector is flatlining after shrinking for the past three months. The composite PMI for the eurozone fell to a two-month low of 52.8 this month, down from 53.8 in July. Factory output weakened, with the eurozone manufacturing PMI falling to a 13-month low of 50.8, closer to the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Firms also reported that job creation had slowed to near-stagnation in August, suggesting that progress in cutting eurozone unemployment is stalling. \"The ongoing subdued and fragile nature of the upturn in economic activity also remains too weak to encourage companies to take on staff in sufficiently large numbers to have a meaningful impact on unemployment,\" Markit said, warning that economic and geopolitical uncertainties are also deterring firms from hiring. Concerns over the eurozone have risen, after figures last week showed that the economy stagnated in the April to June quarter, with German GDP shrinking by 0.2%. August's PMIs suggest that the eurozone will only manage modest growth in the third quarter of 2014. \"The region remains on course to register growth of only around 0.3%-0.4% in the third quarter, a level that is unlikely to stimulate any real turnaround in the labour market,\" warned Rob Dobson of Markit. City economists said the PMIs added to the pressure on the European Central Bank to do more to stimulate the eurozone economy, perhaps through a large quantitative easing programme. The ECB president, Mario Draghi, is due to speak at the Jackson Hole symposium of central bankers in Wyoming on Friday. The data also showed divergence between the eurozone's two largest economies. Output in Germany rose for the 16th month in a row in August, but merely stabilised in France after contracting since May. Germany also saw a modest gain in employee numbers, while France had the steepest pace of job losses since February. Germany's composite output index fell to a two-month low of 54.9, still high enough to suggest steady growth this quarter. \"There were concerns that the German economy was going to suffer because of Ukraine, but today's data shows that the economy is going to keep on growing,\" said Koen De Leus, senior economist at KBC. Separate data from HSBC showed that Chinese factory growth has slowed to a three-month low, with new-order growth dropping. Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief economist for China, said Beijing should supply more policy support to help consolidate the recovery. America's factory sector appears to be growing strongly this month: the US manufacturing PMI jumped to 58.0, the highest reading since April 2010, as companies put last winter's slowdown behind them.",

    "webTitle": "Sweetcorn sales rocket thanks to scorching British summer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sales of fresh sweetcorn have rocketed in the UK as the hot summer has delivered a bumper harvest and strong demand for the barbecue favourite. Barfoots, the UK's biggest grower of the crop, says it has quadrupled sales to more than 4m cobs a week, up from a typical 800,000 at this time of year, making sweetcorn one of the country's most popular vegetables. Waitrose says it has sold nearly half the year's total expected sales of corn on the cob in the past month. Soaring demand has been fuelled by the popularity of barbecues at home, heavily influenced by the US and by chains such as Nando's as well as the recent good weather. Demand for sweetcorn has also been boosted by the trend for South American food inspired by the growing presence on our high streets of chains such as Wahaca, Barburrito and Chiquito. Barfoots supplies 80% of the UK market via restaurants and retailers such as Waitrose, Sainsbury's and Tesco with cobs grown on its 5,000 acres of farmland in the UK's sunniest regions, including Bognor Regis, West Sussex and the Isle of Wight. John Barfoot, commercial director of Barfoots, said: \"Operations to supply the various outlets is 24/7 and harvesting cannot keep up with demand. More workers are being taken on weekly and we can say with confidence that every single UK cob grown this year will be sold. \"The company has been committed to meeting UK demand and has been forced to halt exports to France, Germany and Italy.\" He explained that the crop had been boosted because the UK enjoyed an unusual amount of sun, light winds and very little rain since the start of July \u2013 perfect conditions for growing sweet corn. \"Although we cannot categorically say this is down to global warming there is a definite change in weather patterns over the past couple of years which has had a major effect on sweetcorn supply,\" he said. \"In previous years the UK season has started up to six weeks later than in the past but this year it was the earliest harvest on record by two weeks.\" But this could also lead to a looming shortage, Barfoot warned, as the season will also end slightly earlier than before: \"Sweetcorn is no longer a niche product and its increased demand will see the UK season end up to a month earlier than ever before as we will simply run out. The value in the fields is now priceless in terms of produce.\" Other British produce has been flourishing as a result of the good weather, reducing reliance on imports from overseas. Sainsbury's will be the first retailer to sell British-grown figs in store, following a commercial trial last year. Traditionally it has not been possible to grow figs for commercial use in the UK, but the new figs \u2013 grown at Abbey View Farm in Essex \u2013 will be available in 25 stores until early October. Tesco has just started selling English melons grown in Herefordshire, a county best known for its apples and pears. Tesco produce manager James Cackett said: \"These watermelons taste so good that we don't think shoppers will be able to tell the difference between them and the imported ones sold on high streets from Spain and Brazil. The sweetness level is very good and they are standard size, weighing about between one and three kilos each. \"This is just a trial to see what shoppers think of them but if the reaction is good then we will work with the growers to get more for next year.\"",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, George Osborne, faces a battle to hit this year's borrowing target after the government posted a surprise deficit in the public finances in July. Economists had expected a small surplus of \u00a350m in one of the strongest months of the year for tax receipts, but an increase in government spending resulted in the state posting a deficit of \u00a3239m instead. In the tax year so far, the government has borrowed \u00a332.4bn, \u00a39.4bn more than at the same point last year according to the Office for National Statistics data. Stripping out the impact of cash transfers from the Bank of England, the government has borrowed \u00a337bn this year. At the time of the March budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 the Treasury's independent forecaster \u2013 predicted a fall in borrowing in 2014-15 to \u00a395.5bn, from \u00a3105.8bn in 2013-14. Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets, said that target was beginning to look more challenging: \"The government borrowed money again in July, despite the benefit of this being a seasonally strong month of the year for receipts. From here, the deficit target is looking tougher to meet than the government would have hoped for, or expected, given the performance of the economy.\" The annual comparison is unflattering partly because of higher-than-usual income tax payments early last year, which were the result of tax changes. The figures last year were also boosted by receipts from a Swiss tax avoidance deal. The Treasury insisted it was still on track to meet its full-year targets: \"[The] public sector net borrowing figures continue to be in line with the budget forecast, which predicts the deficit to have halved by the end of this year.\" Over the first four months of the tax year, government tax receipts were 2.1% higher than the same period a year ago, while government spending was up 1.3%. Soumaya Keynes at the Institute for Fiscal Studies said there was still a good chance Osborne would be able to meet his full-year target once the unfavourable comparisons from earlier in the tax year dropped out. \"On the face of it, [higher borrowing in the first four months of the year] is bad news for George Osborne's prospects of achieving the \u00a310bn drop in borrowing that has been forecast by the OBR for the year as a whole. But a closer look at the figures suggests that things may not be as gloomy as they first appear. \"The higher levels of borrowing have been driven by weak growth in tax receipts \u2013 in particular, receipts of income tax, capital gains tax and National Insurance contributions. But this is in large part a timing effect that will unwind later in the year.\" Publishing its own analysis of the July borrowing figures, the OBR said that self assessment payments should boost tax receipts in January and February 2015, improving the full-year picture, but added that weaker-than-expected wage growth is also likely to affect income tax payments and national insurance contributions. James Knightley, economist at ING, said the borrowing figures for the year so far were disappointing. \"This suggests that the Office for Budget Responsibility's full-year forecast is going to be difficult to hit, meaning that the chancellor is probably going to have little room to offer a big pre-election giveaway next year.",

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday, the governor of the Reserve bank,<a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Fcommrep%2F7ecc4eab-8c0d-4a97-9531-5b80cde1ab10%2F0001%22\"> Glenn Stevens, appeared</a> before the House of Representatives economics standing committee and suggested monetary policy has done as much as it can to stimulate the economy.<br></p> <p>Despite rising unemployment and lower than expected economic growth over the next year, Stevens believes lower interest rates are not the answer. He also effectively ruled out introducing any limits on bank lending which might encourage greater lending to businesses and enable rates to be cut without further heating up the housing market.</p> <p>There has been a live experiment into the efficacy of monetary policy over two and half years. During the GFC, a large government\u2019s stimulus package to boost the economy didn\u2019t deter the RBA from cutting interest rates further \u2013 it cut by 425 basis points over just eight months from 7.25% to 3%.</p> <p>Since November 2011 the RBA has again cut rates by 225 basis points from 4.75% to 2.5% during a time when the government showed little intention to help carry the load of stimulating the economy.</p> <p>Whereas in 2009-10 annual growth in public demand \u2013 the impact of government spending on the economy \u2013 rose by 7% (easily biggest in the past 20 years), since 2011-12, despite interest rate cuts, public demand has grown by well below the 20-year average of 3.5%. The May budget confirmed that public demand actually declined in 2012-13:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/unbnK/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"620\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thus, with the government doing little to stimulate the economy through spending, it has been pretty much left to monetary policy to provide any boost. But despite economic and employment growth being below trend, Stevens told the committee he didn\u2019t think lower interest rates \u201care the answer at the moment\u201d.</p> <p>Given his statement was in response to discussion of low consumer confidence levels and revised-down growth forecasts for next year, it would seem monetary policy has not worked as well as the monetary policy fans would like.</p> <p>Certainly, the low interest rates have had an impact on construction. Building approvals before November 2011 were falling, but have since risen significantly:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/ue1I9/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"620\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the boom in building approvals does seem to have peaked around December last year \u2013 mostly due to the decline in apartment blocks and other \u201cnon-house\u201d dwellings.</p> <p>The increase was the desired outcome for the RBA. Building jobs in construction was among the main aims of low interest rates. And while the number of building approvals appears to have peaked, the lag in time taken to go from getting a loan to actual building means there should be a strong level of work still to be done over the next 12 months.</p> <p>Another aim of lowering interest rates is to lower the exchange rate. If Australia\u2019s interest rate offers lower returns compared to other nations, the hope is investors will demand fewer Australia dollars and thus the value of the dollar will fall.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday, the governor of the Reserve bank, Glenn Stevens, appeared before the House of Representatives economics standing committee and suggested monetary policy has done as much as it can to stimulate the economy. Despite rising unemployment and lower than expected economic growth over the next year, Stevens believes lower interest rates are not the answer. He also effectively ruled out introducing any limits on bank lending which might encourage greater lending to businesses and enable rates to be cut without further heating up the housing market. There has been a live experiment into the efficacy of monetary policy over two and half years. During the GFC, a large government\u2019s stimulus package to boost the economy didn\u2019t deter the RBA from cutting interest rates further \u2013 it cut by 425 basis points over just eight months from 7.25% to 3%. Since November 2011 the RBA has again cut rates by 225 basis points from 4.75% to 2.5% during a time when the government showed little intention to help carry the load of stimulating the economy. Whereas in 2009-10 annual growth in public demand \u2013 the impact of government spending on the economy \u2013 rose by 7% (easily biggest in the past 20 years), since 2011-12, despite interest rate cuts, public demand has grown by well below the 20-year average of 3.5%. The May budget confirmed that public demand actually declined in 2012-13: Thus, with the government doing little to stimulate the economy through spending, it has been pretty much left to monetary policy to provide any boost. But despite economic and employment growth being below trend, Stevens told the committee he didn\u2019t think lower interest rates \u201care the answer at the moment\u201d. Given his statement was in response to discussion of low consumer confidence levels and revised-down growth forecasts for next year, it would seem monetary policy has not worked as well as the monetary policy fans would like. Certainly, the low interest rates have had an impact on construction. Building approvals before November 2011 were falling, but have since risen significantly: But the boom in building approvals does seem to have peaked around December last year \u2013 mostly due to the decline in apartment blocks and other \u201cnon-house\u201d dwellings. The increase was the desired outcome for the RBA. Building jobs in construction was among the main aims of low interest rates. And while the number of building approvals appears to have peaked, the lag in time taken to go from getting a loan to actual building means there should be a strong level of work still to be done over the next 12 months. Another aim of lowering interest rates is to lower the exchange rate. If Australia\u2019s interest rate offers lower returns compared to other nations, the hope is investors will demand fewer Australia dollars and thus the value of the dollar will fall. A lower dollar makes Australian exports cheaper, and means our businesses are better able to compete in international markets. The initial rate cuts in November and December 2012 did little to shift the value of the dollar. After brief drops, it rebounded and for most of 2012 it remained above parity with the US dollar: The cut in May 2012 of 50 basis points, combined with what was seen to be an austere budget position, led to the Australian dollar dropping from $US1.03 to US$0.90 in three months. But since the start of this year the dollar has risen again. As Stevens noted in his opening statement, \u201cthe exchange rate, another channel through which monetary policy usually has an effect, is probably not doing as much as it might usually be expected to do in achieving balanced growth\u201d. If we take a broader view, it is clear that employment growth has taken a while to react to the lower interest rates: Both total and full-time employment growth showed little response to the cuts, and both dropped significantly once the round of cuts stopped in August last year. While employment has recently shown signs of improvement, at around 1% annual growth, it remains weak. So if building approvals seem to have peaked, the dollar remains high and employment growth is still so low that an unemployment rate above 6% seems likely for the next 12 months, why not cut rates more? The main problem is the biggest direct impact from interest cuts: housing prices. According to the ABS residential housing price index, housing prices in Sydney are 27% higher than they were in November 2011. In Perth they are 15% higher and in Melbourne 12%. And herein lies the issue. Low interest rates can fuel higher borrowing for houses, but ideally they would also lead to higher borrowing by small businesses either to expand or to start up \u2013 and thus employ new people. Stevens in his opening remarks called for more \u201canimal spirits\u201d from businesses to take risks and make use of the low rates on offer. But as Stevens noted, banks have been reticent to lend to small businesses since the GFC. He suggested \u201cbanks are getting less conservative, actually, at the margin on business lending. I think they are trying harder now than they were, because they want growth themselves\u201d. A look at credit growth data, however, shows the real growth since rates were cut has come from investors in the housing market rather than businesses or even owner-occupier housing buyers: Further lowering interest rates under the current arrangement would likely increase housing investment \u2013 and thus prices \u2013 even were it to foster some increased business investment. One way around this would be to make use of macro-prudential tools that could see limits placed on riskier/speculative housing lending, and encourage lending to businesses. This would in turn allow interest rates to be cut further (and help lower the exchange rate) without fuelling a great binge of housing prices. Stevens made it clear he is not in the macroprudential camp \u2013 despite not ruling out the chance that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) might implement such tools. He referred to them as the \u201cdreaded macroprudential tools\u201d and \u201cthe latest fad\u201d. Perhaps we are asking too much of monetary policy.
