      "bodyText": "The idea of modern banking was born in Siena in 1624, when the Medici Grand Duke decided to guarantee accounts held at Monte dei Paschi, the world\u2019s oldest bank, with the proceeds of pasture he held in the Maremma in south-western Tuscany. Nearly 400 years later, the principle established by the Tuscan ruler \u2013 that account holders and investors are protected by the state \u2013 lies at the heart of a crisis at Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) that is worrying financial markets around the world. The country\u2019s third-largest lender has already been bailed out twice in modern Italian history but is likely to need a third multibillion-euro intervention by the Italian government \u2013 a move that would need Brussels to break new rules designed to prevent such taxpayer bailouts after the 2008 global financial crisis. So the question of who will pay for the inevitable rescue of MPS, whose share value has fallen 80% over the past year, has yet to be answered. Three weeks after the news that Britain has voted to leave the European Union shocked the markets, a debate over the fate of MPS and the economic and political repercussions of inaction is raging from Rome to Brussels and Paris to Berlin. The welfare of thousands of Italian households is at stake, as well as the political fortune of Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who is facing the toughest political challenge of his career. It is also testing Italy\u2019s credibility among foreign investors. \u201cThere is no way they will let the bank go and create a systemic effect,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of Teneo Intelligence. \u201cThe mechanics are still unclear but there will be a third bailout of Monte dei Paschi.\u201d The bank\u2019s financial problems are neither new nor surprising. According to the IMF, Italian banks have \u20ac360bn (\u00a3300bn) of non-performing loans \u2013 loans that are likely to turn into bad debts \u2013 mostly taken out by small Italian businesses battered by years of recession. Italy returned to growth in 2015 but the improvements are only modest and this week the IMF said the country\u2019s GDP was not likely to return to pre-crisis levels until the mid-2020s. Unlike the US, Spanish and Irish financial crises, the Italian banking crisis is not the result of a speculative property bubble. While other issues have exacerbated the turmoil at Monte dei Paschi\u2019s \u2013 including a poorly judged \u20ac9bn acquisition \u2013 the primary reason the bank is in trouble is because it doled out billions of euros in loans to small businesses at a time when the scale of the recession facing Italy was gravely underestimated. From 2007 to 2013, Italy lost about a quarter of its industrial production and tens of thousands of companies collapsed. In 2013 more than 150 shops closed every day. Construction and home sales slumped and none of the sectors has recovered fast enough. \u201cThese are all problems that are well known and have existed for years. The government \u2013 not just this one but the previous one \u2013 should have acted earlier,\u201d said Vincenzo Scarpetta, an analyst at Open Europe. Now the collapse of Monte dei Paschi\u2019s shares, coupled with concern brought on by Brexit and fears that the Siena bank will fail a vital bank stress test on 29 July, has forced Italy\u2019s hand: the banks need a bailout of about \u20ac45bn \u2013 a sum that most experts argue cannot be raised from investors. During years of inaction by successive Italian governments, the country\u2019s banks missed a critical window of opportunity. They are now subject to European banking regulations that would force the bank\u2019s bondholders to take a significant hit before the state can inject funds. About a third of those bondholders are ordinary Italians. Renzi\u2019s government has already had a bitter taste of how badly the crisis could go if Italian pensioners were wiped out by the new rules. Last November the prime minister passed a decree in which four regional banks were saved. While depositors and senior bondholders were protected in the deal, thousands of junior bondholders were wiped out, leading one pensioner to commit suicide and a political backlash against Renzi. But Brussels has so far shown little interest in the domestic economic risks and the potential for political backlash. Last month Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said that the EU would not veer from the new rules. Renzi retorted that he was in no mood to be \u201cgiven a lesson by the schoolteacher\u201d. Earlier this week Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and the head of Eurogroup, the informal grouping of EU\u2019s finance ministers, downplayed the extent of Italy\u2019s banking woes. \u201cThere have always been and will always be bankers who say: \u2018We need more public money to recapitalise our banks\u2019 and I will resist that very strongly because it is, again and again, hitting the taxpayer,\u201d he said. Dijsselbloem was partly responding to Deutsche Bank\u2019s David Folkerts-Landau, who has argued that Brussels needs a \u20ac150bn bailout to begin a major recapitalisation of European banks. Analysts in Italy have raised questions about the huge UniCredit and local banks Rimini and Cesena. Renzi holds an important card in this fight. His Democratic party is the only major political party in Italy that has shown unwavering support for the euro and the EU. His biggest rival, the populist Five Star Movement, is gaining traction following two big wins in local elections in Rome and Turin and could displace Renzi if the prime minister fails to win a critical referendum in the autumn on his sweeping constitutional reforms. He has sworn to resign if the referendum fails. While the constitutional reforms and the banking crisis are not directly linked, Brussels is keenly aware that support for any Renzi initiative will be guided by voters\u2019 view of the economy. \u201cIf Italians lose faith in the banking sector it is a huge problem because going after the banks has always been a big card of the Five Star Movement,\u201d said Piccoli. \u201cIf something goes badly wrong with the banks \u2013 like a run \u2013 it would potentially bring down Renzi\u2019s government because [it has] been saying the banks are solid.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A lack of determination by the government to hold Volkswagen to account may allow the car manufacturer get away with cheating emissions tests in Europe, MPs have warned. In a scathing report, the transport select committee said the Department for Transport had been far too slow and ambivalent over taking any action in the wake of the diesel emissions scandal, while industry regulators had \u201cshown little interest\u201d in whether the law had been broken. The committee urged the DfT to still consider prosecuting VW, which it said had given evidence that was \u201cnot credible\u201d and largely \u201can exercise in damage limitation\u201d. The report said that the company, which initially apologised for its conduct only to then deny that it had done anything wrong, \u201cacted with a cynical disregard for emissions limits which exist solely to protect human health\u201d. Customers in the United States will be compensated after VW admitted last September that 482,000 of its diesel vehicles in the US were fitted with \u201cdefeat devices\u201d to pass emission tests, reaching a $15bn settlement last month with federal authorities. But it has not offered any similar redress to UK consumers \u2013 a position that the committee described as \u201cdeeply unfair\u201d. Although VW said 1.2m UK cars were affected, it has disputed whether the same software is illegal in the EU. Although the then transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said that VW could face action from the Serious Fraud Office, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and under his own powers, the report found: \u201cIn practice little action has been taken.\u201d Committee chair, Louise Ellman MP, warned that without proper sanctions a similar scandal could happen again. She said: \u201cVolkswagen\u2019s evidence to us was just not credible but the government has lacked the will to hold VW accountable for its actions. There is a real danger that VW will be able to get away with cheating emissions tests in Europe if regulators do not act.\u201d She said the committee welcomed the planned introduction of real-world driving emissions tests and a stricter lab test for measuring fuel consumption, but added: \u201cAs vehicle technology becomes more advanced, what is most urgently needed is a robust regulator which can keep ahead of developments in technology. That regulator does not exist today. The VCA [vehicle certification agency] must make scrutinising manufacturers for non-compliance and questionable practices its first priority.\u201d The report said that more independent testing and more checks and balances were required to restore consumer confidence. Ellman added: \u201cWe are concerned that manufacturers have far too great a say over how type approval reforms are implemented. There is strong evidence that vehicle manufacturers have employed a wide range of practices that are, in effect, defeat devices by another name.\u201d A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe take the unacceptable actions of VW extremely seriously, and we have taken robust action to protect the UK consumer. That is why we called for a Europe-wide investigation, and were the first country in Europe to complete our own tests to ensure the issue was not industry-wide. We continue to push VW to ensure it takes action. \u201cWe led the way in pushing for the introduction of the real driving emissions test that starts next year, which will ensure that emissions measurements reflect real-world performance, improve air quality and give consumers confidence. This new test is robust and will make a real difference.\u201d Volkswagen\u2019s board of management said: \u201cWe take these issues very seriously and deeply regret that we have broken the trust of our customers and the general public. We are cooperating openly and fully with the relevant authorities to clarify the facts of the matter quickly and comprehensively. Volkswagen has commissioned an external investigation into the matter, which will also address the issue of responsibilities. This investigation has not yet been completed.\u201d However, the carmaker\u2019s attempts to draw a line under the scandal in the US have been rejected by Californian regulators, who said that the proposed fix for its larger diesel vehicles with defeat devices were \u201cincomplete, substantially deficient, and fall far short of meeting the legal requirements\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Steinhoff, the South African group, is expected to face pressure to increase its \u00a3597m offer for Poundland after rebel investor Elliott Advisors revealed it had taken control of a 13.2% stake. On Wednesday, Poundland said it had agreed a takeover by Steinhoff, the South African retail conglomerate that owns Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK. The struggling discount retailer recommended the deal to shareholders, who will receive 220p a share, plus the 2p a share dividend announced in June for the year ending 27 March. But a stock exchange announcement on Thursday revealed that Elliott Capital Advisors, the UK arm of US hedge fund Elliott Management now spoke for a 13.2% stake controlled via contracts for difference (CFD). A CFD is an agreement between two parties \u2013 the investor and the CFD provider \u2013 to pay each other the change in the price of an underlying asset, in this case Poundland shares. The stake is not high enough to block the takeover deal in its current form but could nevertheless create a headache for the prospective buyers. Poundland shares closed up 3.75p at 224.5p. Elliott has a history of agitating for change at companies and pushing for better terms in takeovers. A recent high profile target was Alliance Trust, one of the UK\u2019s oldest investment firms, which eventually agreed to appoint two of the three independent directors it had nominated. Other examples include Quintain Estates and Development, the developer behind Wembley Arena, where Elliott also used CFDs to get US private equity group Lone Star to up its offer. Darren Shapland, the chairman of Poundland, said on Wednesday that the takeover would allow the retailer to achieve its turnaround ambitions sooner than expected \u201cagainst a background of increasing economic uncertainty in the UK and a more challenging trading environment\u201d. The retailer has only been listed for two years, floating at 300p a share in March 2014. But its shares have plunged in value over the past year due to poor trading, competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl and its \u00a355m takeover of 99p Stores, which was delayed by a competition inquiry. During the six-month investigation by the regulator, 99p Stores lost its credit insurance, which meant the retailer was cut off by many suppliers, leaving it with empty shelves and resulting i the departure of 1,000 staff. A spokesman for Steinhoff said there was no change to the terms of the deal set out on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Elliott declined to comment.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England keeps cool head amid rate hysteria", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It would have been the easiest thing in the world for the Bank of England to cut interest rates at the first meeting of its monetary policy committee since the Brexit vote three weeks ago. Surveys have shown that the shock waves from the referendum have hit consumer and business confidence hard, and had an immediate impact on both residential and commercial property. The Bank\u2019s own assessment of the likely impact of a vote to leave has not changed since June 23: life is going to be tough, at least in the short term. What\u2019s more, the financial markets had been primed for a rate cut by none other than the governor of the Bank of England. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote, Mark Carney said it was his personal view that during summer the Bank would need to boost growth. As far as many in the City were concerned, that meant a July rate cut. After all, if the economy was shaky and rates were going to come down at some point, then why wait? In the end, the Bank resisted the temptation to reduce the cost of borrowing for the first time in more than seven years. Only one of the nine members of the MPC favoured providing an instant stimulus to the economy, and it wasn\u2019t Carney. The governor was one of eight MPC members who thought the time was not yet ripe. Cue tart comments from those analysts who called it wrong that Carney was indeed the equivalent of \u201can unreliable boyfriend\u201d, forever failing to match words with action. There were, though, plenty of reasons for the Bank to keep its powder dry. Firstly, the Bank wants to have a closer look at the state of the economy before moving. There has been very little hard data since 23 June but the picture will be clearer by the time of the next MPC meeting in early August, which coincides with the release of the Bank\u2019s quarterly assessment of the state of the nation. This will provide forecasts for growth and inflation over the coming months, and provide a justification for whatever the Bank decides to do. Secondly, the financial market reaction since the referendum has been less acute than looked likely in late June. Share prices have bounced, the pound has stabilised and even edged up a bit on the foreign exchanges, and long-term interest rates have fallen. Thirdly, the economy has already received something of a stimulus from the fall in the pound \u2013 which boosts exports \u2013 and from the Bank\u2019s decision to ease the capital requirements on commercial banks, which increases their capacity to lend. Fourthly, it is hard to see what material effect a cut in interest rates to 0.25% will have, given that they are already at record low levels. The situation is different now from the aftermath of Black Wednesday in September 1992, when borrowing costs could be cut aggressively from 10%. Finally, there was a risk that by acting in a kneejerk fashion, the Bank could make matters worse.

      "body": "<p>It would have been the easiest thing in the world for the Bank of England to cut interest rates at the first meeting of its monetary policy committee since the Brexit vote three weeks ago. </p> <p>Surveys have shown that the shock waves from the referendum have hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/brexit-vote-batters-consumer-confidence-slide-gfk-yougov-regions\">consumer</a> and business confidence hard, and had an immediate impact on both residential and commercial property. The Bank\u2019s own assessment of the likely impact of a vote to leave has not changed since June 23: life is going to be tough, at least in the short term.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the financial markets had been primed for a rate cut by none other than the governor of the Bank of England. In the aftermath of the Brexit vote, Mark Carney said it was his personal view that during summer the Bank would need to boost growth. As far as many in the City were concerned, that meant a July rate cut. After all, if the economy was shaky and rates were going to come down at some point, then why wait?</p> <p>In the end, the Bank resisted the temptation to reduce the cost of borrowing for the first time in more than seven years. Only one of the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Documents/mpc/pdf/2016/jul.pdf\">nine members of the MPC favoured providing an instant stimulus to the economy</a>, and it wasn\u2019t Carney. The governor was one of eight MPC members who thought the time was not yet ripe. Cue tart comments from those analysts who called it wrong that Carney was indeed the equivalent of \u201can unreliable boyfriend\u201d, forever failing to match words with action.</p> <p>There were, though, plenty of reasons for the Bank to keep its powder dry. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/bank-of-england-leaves-uk-interest-rates-on-hold-at-05\">Bank of England leaves UK interest rates on hold at 0.5%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Firstly, the Bank wants to have a closer look at the state of the economy before moving. There has been very little hard data since 23 June but the picture will be clearer by the time of the next MPC meeting in early August, which coincides with the release of the Bank\u2019s quarterly assessment of the state of the nation.</p> <p>This will provide forecasts for growth and inflation over the coming months, and provide a justification for whatever the Bank decides to do.</p> <p>Secondly, the financial market reaction since the referendum has been less acute than looked likely in late June. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/ftse100-enters-bull-market-theresa-may-pm-elect-wall-street-surges-base-rate-cut-hopes\">Share prices have bounced</a>, the pound has stabilised and even edged up a bit on the foreign exchanges, and long-term interest rates have fallen.</p> <p>Thirdly, the economy has already received something of a stimulus from the fall in the pound \u2013 which boosts exports \u2013 and from the Bank\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability\">ease the capital requirements on commercial banks</a>, which increases their capacity to lend.</p> <p>Fourthly, it is hard to see what material effect a cut in interest rates to 0.25% will have, given that they are already at record low levels. The situation is different now from the aftermath of Black Wednesday in September 1992, when borrowing costs could be cut aggressively from 10%. </p> <p>Finally, there was a risk that by acting in a kneejerk fashion, the Bank could make matters worse. If consumers and businesses get the impression that the Bank is being rushed into action, it could further dent confidence. There was also the chance that by making the announcement at the time when Theresa May was assembling her new cabinet, a rate cut would have got lost in the mix.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s consumers and businesses will have to wait another month for the Bank of England to provide a boost to the ailing post-Brexit economy after Threadneeedle Street decided against an immediate cut in borrowing costs in the wake of last month\u2019s referendum. The Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee confounded City analysts who had widely expected a fall in business and consumer confidence to prompt an immediate cut in interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. Instead the MPC dropped the broadest of hints that the first cut in interest rates since 2009 would come in August, with a package of measures designed to prevent activity stalling in the second half of 2016. Minutes of the MPC meeting showed that the majority of members thought there could only be the shortest of delays before action was taken to stimulate activity. The Bank also warned that it expects \u201csizeable falls\u201d in commercial property values in the coming months and also revised down the outlook for house prices. But news that rates had been left on hold prompted a sharp rise in the value of the pound \u2013 because lower interest rates tend to weaken currencies. Sterling rose by almost two cents against the US dollar to end the day just above $1.33. City experts now predict that August will see the Bank deliver a package that will halve official interest rates to 0.25%, sanction an increase in the money-creating quantitative easing programme, and expand the cut-price loans provided by the government\u2019s Funding for Lending scheme. \u201cOfficial data on economic activity covering the period since the referendum are not yet available\u201d, the minutes of the MPC meeting said. \u201cHowever, there are preliminary signs that the result has affected sentiment among households and companies, with sharp falls in some measures of business and consumer confidence.\u201d The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, held his first meeting with the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, before the noon announcement that interest rates were for now being left on hold and that there would be no expansion of the \u00a3375bn quantitative easing scheme. Hammond made it clear during his first round of media interviews that he had no intention of delivering a post-Brexit budget but would wait until the Autumn Statement towards the end of the year before outlining the May administration\u2019s plans for tax, public spending and deficit reduction. That puts the onus on the Bank to provide support for the economy once it has completed a comprehensive assessment of the outlook in its quarterly inflation report. David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies International, said there was a \u201cstrong case\u201d for Hammond bringing forward the timing of the Autumn Statement to early November to show a more joined up policy response. \u201cWhat chance the government finances investment projects using infrastructure bonds which the BoE ultimately buys?\u201d Speeches from MPC members over the next two weeks will now be pored over for clues as to what the Bank is planning in early August. Only one member, Gertjan Vlieghe, an external member know for his dovish views, voted in favour of an instant response to the Brexit vote. Carney, speaking a week after the shock Brexit vote, had alerted financial markets to the possibility of an immediate rate cut when he said his personal view was \u201cthe economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u201d. Dennis de Jong, managing director at currency broker UFX.com said: \u201cThe Bank of England faced its biggest interest rate decision since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis today, and its decision against cutting the rate for the first time in more than seven years shows that Mark Carney and co believe the storm can be weathered in the short term. \u201cHowever, the unprecedented uncertainty means we could still see radical steps taken in the coming weeks to ward of a Brexit-induced recession. Desperate times call for desperate measures.\u201d The MPC said it recognised that a business and consumer confidence had fallen steeply before and after the vote while house buyers had delayed purchases, especially in London and the south east.

      "bodyText": "When Nicholas Ridley turned up as secretary of state at the Department for Trade and Industry in 1989 he famously asked: \u201cWhat is the DTI for? I\u2019ve got bugger all to do, and thousands of staff to help me do it.\u201d In the age of Thatcherite privatisations, the sentiment struck a chord. Wasn\u2019t the job of government to get out of the way of business? The crisis of identity continued until the New Labour years. Under Gordon Brown\u2019s chancellorship, the Treasury always seemed to have a bigger voice in business affairs anyway. In 2007, the DTI was disbanded and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform created. It lasted only two years until the next shuffle, with Lord Mandelson back in government, saw the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills coming into being, assuming responsibility for skills, apprenticeships and higher and further education. Now the wheel is turning again. Theresa May has merged two departments to create the Department of Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, and has returned skills and so on to the education department. The new department\u2019s bold name, and its broad brief, looks like a statement of intent. The last two words were presumably designed to send a message that the UK will not be shy about actually having an industrial strategy.

I\u2019ve got bugger all to do, and thousands of staff to help me do it.\u201d In the age of Thatcherite privatisations, the sentiment struck a chord. Wasn\u2019t the job of government to get out of the way of business?</p> <p>The crisis of identity continued until the New Labour years. Under Gordon Brown\u2019s chancellorship, the Treasury always seemed to have a bigger voice in business affairs anyway. In 2007, the DTI was disbanded and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform created. It lasted only two years until the next shuffle, with Lord Mandelson back in government, saw the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills coming into being, assuming responsibility for skills, apprenticeships and higher and further education.</p> <p>Now the wheel is turning again. Theresa May has merged two departments to create the Department of Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, and has returned skills and so on to the education department. The new department\u2019s bold name, and its broad brief, looks like a statement of intent. The last two words were presumably designed to send a message that the UK will not be shy about actually having an industrial strategy.</p> <p>That has been in doubt during Sajid Javid\u2019s short tenure. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly like the word strategy coupled with industrial,\u201d he told the FT last year, seemingly marking out his ideological difference with Sir Vince Cable, his Liberal Democrat predecessor during the coalition government of 2010-15.</p> <p>May has offered little detail about her plans for the economy.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "About 3,500 Post Office workers are being forced to take a cut in pension benefits as the government-backed service tries to cut costs. About half the Post Office\u2019s 7,000-strong workforce is being forced to shift from a final salary pension scheme to a defined contribution scheme, a move that unions say could cut retirement benefits by 30% or even more in some cases. The planned pension cuts were announced just days after the Post Office said it would be looking to put 20 more Crown offices into private hands, taking the total this year to 85 in a process opposed by unions who see it as a form of backdoor privatisation of the service. The Post Office was already facing criticism after agreeing to hand over up to 61 branches to WH Smith in April including some of the 39 Crown offices flagged up to be put into private hands in January. Before that, 50 Crown offices, which are run directly by the Post Office, had been franchised or otherwise offloaded since 2013. Unite and fellow Post Office union the CWU are to ballot members on protest action over the cuts to pensions. Unite is also calling on Theresa May\u2019s new government to investigate the financial difficulties of the Post Office, which remained publicly owned after the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail postal service in 2013. Brian Scott, Unite officer for members in the Post Office, said: \u201cThis is a sad day for Unite members in the Post Office who are being let down by senior executives that failed to secure the necessary funding to ensure a long-term future for the scheme. The Post Office wants to close this scheme at a time when it is still in surplus to the tune of as much as \u00a3100m. There is no need to close the scheme and Unite members are furious.\u201d Andy Furey, a CWU official, said: \u201cCWU is completely opposed to the closure of the Post Office defined benefits pension scheme. This is another cost-cutting exercise to prop up their balance sheet at the expense of staff. The scheme itself is in rude health, carrying a surplus. We will be balloting our members for strike action over this attack on their quality of life after retirement along with our opposition to the company\u2019s dogged pursuit of closures, privatisation and up to 2,000 job losses.\u201d The Post Office\u2019s final salary scheme was closed to new members in 2008 but long-serving staff have continued to accrue benefits since then. The Post Office has now decided it wants to close the scheme to new accruals and from March next year members will only be able to build up benefits in a new defined contribution scheme. Unlike a final salary scheme, which promises a specific income, the income from a defined contribution scheme is dependent on the amount paid in and the performance of the fund\u2019s investments. The Post Office said it had made its recommendation to the pension fund\u2019s trustees but no final decision had been taken. Natasha Wilson, the Post Office\u2019s director of reward and pensions, said: \u201cThis is clearly an important decision and both we and the trustees take our stewardship responsibilities very seriously. It is only right that the trustees give due consideration to our recommendation in reaching a decision, and we are fully supportive.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There was cheer for investors on Thursday as the company behind the Superdry clothing brand signalled its confidence in the future by paying a special dividend. SuperGroup said pre-tax profits were up 16% at \u00a373.5m as it attracted more female shoppers as well as male big spenders thanks to the high-end collaboration between Superdry, normally best known for its logoed hooded tops, jogging bottoms and checked shirts, and the actor Idris Elba. Sales rose more than a fifth to \u00a3590.1m in the year to 30 April. The chief executive, Euan Sutherland, said the company was on its way to becoming a global lifestyle brand as it expands its womenswear collections and enters new markets such as sportswear. SuperGroup is also expanding internationally with ambitions to crack the notoriously tough US and Chinese markets in the coming year. \u201cNotwithstanding the current economic uncertainty, we remain well placed [to succeed],\u201d he said, adding it was \u201cmaking good early progress\u201d in the two countries. SuperGroup, which listed on the London stock market six years ago, paid its first ever dividend at the half-year stage. The final dividend of 17p a share combined with the 20p special payout are worth a total of \u00a330m to shareholders. \u201cWith high confidence in the brand and our strategy we will pay our first special dividend at the same time as the final ordinary dividend,\u201d said Sutherland. Shares closed up nearly 17% at \u00a315.65, the biggest riser of the day on the FTSE 250 index. The collapse of sterling is bad news for retailers that source goods in dollars. Sutherland said SuperGroup was hedged against the dollar for the next 18 months but it would be affected if the weakness persists as about 50% of the goods it imports are paid for in the currency. On the other hand the firm benefits from a positive sales translation effect because 55% of its revenue is from outside the UK. \u201cI think relative to other players we\u2019re better placed,\u201d he said. At baby goods retailer Mothercare, bad weather was blamed for a slowdown in its UK sales in recent weeks, which prompted it to bring its end-of-season sale forward. In the UK, like-for-like sales rose 1.2% in the 15 weeks to 9 July, down from the 2.1% growth reported in the previous quarter. The Mothercare boss, Mark Newton-Jones, said: \u201cWe have not seen any immediate consumer reaction to the Brexit vote, but it is too early to call as we went into the end-of-season sale early. We hedge both dollar purchases and royalty receipts and we expect limited impact on our financial results this year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Halfords has reported another sharp drop in bicycle sales as Britons prove to be fair-weather cyclists. Its chief executive, Jill McDonald, said the 4% decline in bike sales in the three months to 1 July was \u201cprincipally weather related\u201d and denied interest in the sport had peaked. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe believe the long-term outlook for cycling is positive.\u201d The fresh slump follows last year\u2019s disappointing performance where cycling sales finished down 0.9% after a disastrous summer. McDonald said Halfords still had the peak summer months ahead and it was well placed to benefit from a rise in staycations if more Britons opted to holiday at home this year due to the weakness of the pound. It also hopes to attract shoppers with new bikes developed with the likes of British Olympian Laura Trott and designer Orla Kiely. The success of British cyclists such as Chris Froome in the Tour de France, as well as the upcoming Rio Olympics, would also stimulate interest in the sport, she said. The collapse in the value of the pound following the vote for Brexit has affected many retailers\u2019 sourcing costs, with Halfords already warning of a \u00a33m hit to profits. It has now covered more than 75% of this year\u2019s dollar purchases with the pound at $1.45 but warned if sterling fell further there might be a \u201csmall further impact later in this financial year, depending on the extent to which it can be mitigated\u201d. The retailer\u2019s motoring division, which accounts for 70% of its store sales, fared better with underlying sales ahead 0.6%. When adjusted for the timing of Easter, store sales were only slightly negative. The shares closed down 4.3p at 330.6p. Liberum analyst Adam Tomlinson described the update as disappointing. \u201cRetail like-for-like sales have declined and come in below expectations which were not stretching. Cycling was the key disappointment and this highlights the category\u2019s reliance on favourable weather to support growth.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England surprises City by leaving interest rates on hold \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The dust is settling across the City after the Bank of England ducked away from cutting rates to fresh record lows. Economists and analysts are turning their attention back to Downing Street, as Theresa May continues to reshape the government.... ...although some traders are being distracted by Mont Ventoux instead: So, that\u2019s a good moment to wrap up. Here\u2019s our news story on the Bank of England\u2019s decision: Have a good evening. GW Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says there are five good reasons for leaving interest rates on hold: Firstly, the Bank wants to have a closer look at the state of the economy before moving. There has been very little hard data since 23 June but the picture will be clearer by the time of the next MPC meeting in early August, which coincides with the release of the Bank\u2019s quarterly assessment of the state of the nation. This will provide forecasts for growth and inflation over the coming months, and provide a justification for whatever the Bank decides to do. Secondly, the financial market reaction since the referendum has been less acute than looked likely in late June. Share prices have bounced, the pound has stabilised and even edged up a bit on the foreign exchanges, and long-term interest rates have fallen. Thirdly, the economy has received something of a stimulus from the fall in the pound \u2013 which boosts exports \u2013 and from the Bank\u2019s decision to ease the capital requirements on commercial banks, which increases their capacity to lend. Fourthly, it is hard to see what material effect a cut in interest rates to 0.25% will have, given that they are already at record low levels. The situation is different now from the aftermath of Black Wednesday in September 1992, when borrowing costs could be cut aggressively from 10%. Finally, there was a risk that by acting in a kneejerk fashion, the Bank could make matters worse. If consumers and businesses get the impression that the Bank is being rushed into action, it could further dent confidence. No chance of a quiet August.... The pound is now on track for its best week in over six years, according to Jeremy Cook of World First. But as this graph shows, sterling is still around 10% below its pre-referendum levels. More reaction is flooding in, and many economists are saying the Bank made the right call by leaving interest rates unchanged. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, calls it a \u201cvery sensible decision\u201d. Sentance, a former member of the MPC, argues that the Bank should also sit tight in August: Though political events have been fast-moving, there is a need for stable economic policy until we are clearer how the economy is performing in the wake of the EU Referendum result. That will not be clear until the Autumn, and the MPC should hold fire until then. The MPC still won\u2019t have enough information in August to make a proper assessment of the post-Brexit economic situation. \u201cLooking further ahead, the MPC needs to recognise that interest rates are already extremely low and have been for seven years. So there is very little that monetary policy can now do to support the economy. We need to look to fiscal policy - government spending and tax measures - and supply-side policies, which aim to make the UK a more attractive environment for business activity, to offset the shock of the Brexit decision.\u201d Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, believes the Bank is rightly hesitant to commit to any major moves while the Brexit situation is uncertain. This wait-and-see approach is now appropriate, especially given the fact that the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU remains so unclear. The BoE will continue to wait for the smoke to clear before pushing the panic button.\u201d Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says it all depends on the data: \u201cThe Bank of England has stayed true to form and today\u2019s decision is consistent with its \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to monetary policy.\u201d As recently as this week\u2019s FPC testimony, Carney was emphasising that the direction of the monetary policy response to Brexit would depend on the relative effects of demand, supply, and sterling. Under this model, the BoE\u2019s decision to hold fire on rates makes sense as there\u2019s not yet enough data to decide on the appropriate response, even if most committee members are clearly leaning towards easing policy. City analyst Louise Cooper questions whether a rate cut would actually do any good: James Andrews, Head of Investment Management at Redmayne-Bentley, an investment management and stockbroking firm, cautions that an August rate cut isn\u2019t guaranteed: \u201cIt remains to be seen whether we will see a cut next month once the Bank of England have more hard data on the economic impact of the vote to leave. It\u2019s clear that currently all they have is sentiment, rather than hard data on which to base a decision, and have therefore erred on the side of caution. In the short term, we would expect further pain for domestically focussed UK listed companies as no further stimulus/support for the economy has been forthcoming at this time.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Kevin Young captured the moment when the City learned that UK interest rates were on hold, sending sterling up by two cents: Alan Clarke, economist at Scotia Bank, has blasted Mark Carney for creating the impression that the Bank of England might cut rates today. He writes that Carney, who was famously labelled an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 early in his tenure, should have known better. If ever there was a case for abandoning forward guidance and central bankers keeping quiet, this meeting is it. Virtually nobody was going for a rate cut at this meeting before Carney\u2019s intervention a couple of weeks ago. Most assumed that the weakness of the pound and the need to wait for incoming data would lead to a pause at least until August. But for no apparent reason, Governor Carney decided to tease the market, let it price in a high probability of a rate cut, only to disappoint. As if the situation wasn\u2019t volatile and uncertain enough, the BoE Governor poured petrol on the flames. This was a completely unnecessary intervention. Duncan Weldon, head of research at the Resolution Group, has an interesting theory. He reckons that Bank of England might not cut rates next month either, and might launch more quantitative easing or a new funding for lending scheme (FLS) instead. He\u2019s basing that on the Bank\u2019s minutes (the part I posted a few minutes ago) Shares in London have fallen back following the surprise news that UK interest rates are on hold. The FTSE 100 index, which was up 60 points at 11.59am, is now flat. That\u2019s largely due to the surge in sterling -- a stronger pound will eat into the overseas earnings of the large multinationals in the blue-chip index. UK interest rates have never been this low, and they\u2019ve rarely been unchanged for this long. With interest rates remaining stable, there is no need to update our monetary policy symphony.... Commercial property prices are going to suffer \u2018sizeable\u2019 falls following last month\u2019s Brexit vote, says the Bank of England. It has also trimmed its forecast for house price rises. Today\u2019s minutes state that: Regarding the housing market, a preview of the June RICS survey had pointed to a marked weakening in expected activity and prices following the referendum result. Bank staff had lowered their forecast of housing investment significantly and had revised down the near-term outlook for house prices. The forecast for housing investment had a direct read-across to GDP, while the outlook for house prices was expected to act as a drag on household consumption. Staff were also expecting sizeable falls in commercial real estate prices in the near term. Lionel Barber, editor of the FT, reckons the Bank of England didn\u2019t want to cause alarm by slashing rates today. Sky News\u2019s Dharshini David believes the BoE needs more evidence about the UK economy following the Brexit vote. Economist Marc Ostwald reckons the Bank made the right decision. You can see the minutes of the meeting online, here. The key section comes at the end, where the Bank explains that its policymakers decided to resist easing monetary policy until they have done more analysis of the situation. Here\u2019s a flavour (I\u2019ve bolded up the key points). The MPC was committed to taking whatever action was needed to support growth and to return inflation to the target over an appropriate horizon. To that end, most members of the Committee expected monetary policy to be loosened in August. The Committee reviewed a range of possible stimulus measures and combinations thereof. It considered the potential interaction between various measures and the financial system, and therefore their influence on output and inflation. Committee members had an initial exchange of views on various possible packages of measures. The exact extent of any additional stimulus measures would be based on the Committee\u2019s updated forecast. Their composition would take account of any interactions with the financial system and their effectiveness in supporting the domestic economy. Further detailed analysis across all policy areas of the Bank would be required. Against that backdrop, most members judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting. For one member, the subdued economic outlook before the referendum had already come close to warranting further stimulus. The early evidence supported the view that demand was likely to weaken further following the referendum. The resulting outlook for medium-term inflation \u2013 even taking into account the boost from the lower level of sterling \u2013 therefore justified an immediate loosening of monetary policy, to be supplemented by a package of additional measures in August. So, Mark Carney then proposed leaving interest rates on hold -- most of the committee backed him. However the newest member, Gertjan Vlieghe (a former hedge fund economist) pushed for an immediate rate cut. The Bank of England\u2019s agents, who work across the UK, are seeing signs that the economy is weakening. It says: Official data on economic activity covering the period since the referendum are not yet available. However, there are preliminary signs that the result has affected sentiment among households and companies, with sharp falls in some measures of business and consumer confidence. And the BoE singles out the housing market as a significant concern: Early indications from surveys and from contacts of the Bank\u2019s Agents suggest that some businesses are beginning to delay investment projects and postpone recruitment decisions. Regarding the housing market, survey data point to a significant weakening in expected activity. Taken together, these indicators suggest economic activity is likely to weaken in the near term. As well as leaving rates on hold, the Bank of England voted 9-0 to leave its quantitative easing programme unchanged at \u00a3375bn. Good news for holidaymakers heading to Europe this summer.... the pound has jumped by 1.5 cents against the euro to \u20ac1.20. The Bank of England has also delivered a clear signal that it will ease monetary policy in August. The minutes of today\u2019s meeting state that: \u201cIn the absence of a further worsening in the trade-off between supporting growth and returning inflation to target on a sustainable basis, most members of the Committee expect monetary policy to be loosened in August, \u201cThe precise size and nature of any stimulatory measures will be determined during the August forecast and Inflation Report round.\u201d That will give the Bank\u2019s economists more time to actually see the impact of the Brexit vote on the UK economy. One Bank of England policymaker, Gertjan Vlieghe, voted to cut interest rates to 0.25%. But the other eight members of the MPC voted to leave borrowing costs on hold until August. The pound is surging!! It\u2019s up by two cents against the US dollar, to $1.336, following the surprise decision to leave interest rates at 0.5%. Breaking news! The Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged, dashing expectations of a rate cut. More to follow! FIVE MINUTES TO GO...... Currently the pound is trading at $1.323 against the US dollar, up almost a cent today. And the FTSE 100 is up 62 points, or almost 1%, at 6732. The Bank of England faced a very tricky decision this month... weighing up the risks to economic growth against the prospect of higher inflation. Mark Carney and colleagues will also be aware that they can\u2019t cut interest rates much lower -- although negative borrowing costs are an option. So a quarter-point cut to 0.25% would give leeway for further cuts in the future. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, explains how political developments will also have influenced the BoE: The Bank of England is widely expected to do something today, possibly deliver a 25 basis point rate cut. But it could also restart its bond buying programme and introduce other measures to support lending to households and businesses. However, the swift appointment of a new Prime Minister in the UK means the political situation here is now a lot less uncertain, while the pound\u2019s sharp depreciation in the aftermath of the Brexit vote means import costs are rising which may be passed onto the consumer. So, inflation could be on the rise. Therefore, the BoE may actually hold off cutting interest rates at this meeting or at the very most deliver a small cut \u2013 certainly no more than 25 basis points, in my view. A small rate cut will still keep intact the bank\u2019s credibility because it will have done something as promised, while at the same time it will unlikely overcook inflation. Tension is rising in the City as the clock hands tick towards noon.... Just thirty minutes to go, until the most eagerly awaited Bank of England interest rate decision since the height of the financial crisis. Most City traders appear to be expecting an interest rate cut. But most City traders expected Britain to vote to stay in the EU three weeks ago..... As Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets puts it: \u201cEquity markets are in the green this morning, perhaps worryingly so given the potential for a negative surprise from the Bank of England at midday. Traders are currently pricing in an 80% chance of a rate cut, but just take a step back and recall the last time markets priced in an 80% chance of something happening. It\u2019s no secret that the US government is very concerned about the Brexit vote. And that\u2019s why Treasury secretary Jack Lew is racing to London from Berlin today, where he\u2019s been meeting Germany\u2019s finance minister. Before jumping on his flight to meet chancellor Philip Hammond, Lew told reporters in Berlin that both sides need to be pragmatic and flexible. Reuters has the key quotes from Lew: \u201cI will be meeting with the new chancellor this afternoon, I look forward to it. \u201cWe believe that it is in the best interests of Europe, of the United States and the global economy to end up with a result that produces a highly integrated relationship between the UK and the EU. \u201cWe think it is critical that negotiations take place in a pragmatic, transparent and smooth manner and for both sides to demonstrate flexibility. Lew has originally been expecting to meet George Osborne, before Theresa May wielded the knife with such vigour. The decision on interest rates will dominate the headlines, but the real story may be in the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting. The Bank could use the minutes to signal its concerns about Brexit, but won\u2019t want to spark panic in the City either, so the wording will be crucial..... Cutting interest rates to fresh record lows would be a start, but it\u2019s not enough to rescue the economy from the swamp of a Brexit-induced recession. Britain also needs a big dose of government spending to help the real economy, in a reversal of George Osborne\u2019s austerity agenda. That\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s view. Here\u2019s a flavour: The Bank should drop rates, starting this Thursday. But while historic, even a cut would not achieve what might be expected in normal times. Interest rates are already very near what\u2019s called the zero lower bound \u2013 the point at which cuts will not stimulate further growth. As for the Bank going in for more quantitative easing, \u00a3375bn has already been pumped into the financial system, benefiting the rich and pumping up London house prices. The real boost to growth will only come with a big burst of public spending on infrastructure, services and benefits \u2013 the areas that have suffered most under austerity. Theresa May has already talked about infrastructure bonds, but she will need to go a lot further than that. That may be ideologically uncomfortable for the Tories, now seeking ways to mitigate economic and social damage from the referendum they called. But they should consider the words of Mr Carney: \u201cOne uncomfortable truth is that there are limits to what the Bank of England can do.\u201d European stock markets have hit their highest levels since the EU referendum on 23 June. But that\u2019s not a sign of economic confidence. Instead, traders are expecting even more monetary easing from the world\u2019s central bankers. Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels, explains: \u201cEuropean shares have made up most of the lost ground after the Brexit shock. The main, if not only, reason for this is that they anticipate a strong policy response from central banks. \u201cA rate cut by the BoE is almost a certainty.\u201d Here\u2019s a great chart from the Resolution Foundation, showing how the markets have consistently expected interest rates to rise....and been consistently disappointed. The last decade have been a \u2018game of two halves\u2019 at the Bank of England. Once the credit crunch struck in 2007, it slashed borrowing costs to record lows and pumped hundreds of billions into the economy through QE. But in recent years, the BoE has been sitting on its hands, while telling the UK that borrowing costs were likely to soon start rising. They never did, though, and now a cut seems rather more likely. Here\u2019s a timeline of the key events: The Brexit referendum has already sent a chill through Britain\u2019s housing market. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors\u2019 latest survey shows that enquiries from potential buyers fell sharply last month. Surveyors are also much gloomier. Expectations of future sales fell at the fastest rate since the survey began in 1998, and the balance of surveyors expecting house prices to fall in the next three months hit a five-year high. Here\u2019s a video clip of Britain\u2019s new chancellor telling the nation not to expect an emergency budget this summer: The Bank of England actually took its decision yesterday, but won\u2019t announce it until noon today. Normally, that delay wouldn\u2019t matter. But a lot has happened in the last 24 hours.... Fact of the morning: None of the nine policymakers on the Monetary Policy Committee have ever voted to cut UK interest rates. One, Ian McCafferty, spent months arguing that borrowing costs should go up. Britain\u2019s stock market has hits its highest level since the turmoil of last summer, as investors await the Bank of England\u2019s decision in three hours time. The FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip companies jumped by almost 1% in early trading to 6,742, a level not seen since August 2015. The rally is led by miners, including Anglo American and UK housebuilders such as Barratt Development and Taylor Wimpey. That suggests investors are anticipating fresh action from the Bank of England to help the economy. The FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK-focused firms than the FTSE 100, has risen by 0.6% today. Tony Cross of TrustNet says the sight of Theresa May getting down to work has brought calm to the City. The FTSE-100 is bounding higher ahead of that key MPC rate verdict that\u2019s due at midday and perhaps once again an air of confidence that\u2019s building in the market as the new prime minister announces her cabinet. That said, a cut from Mark Carney today is far from guaranteed and there\u2019s also this theme emerging of trying to ensure that the BoE doesn\u2019t actively talk the country into recession. James Rossiter, economist at City firm TD Securities, expects a quarter-point rate cut today (from 0.5% to 0.25%). That would be followed by further easing in August, predicts Rossiter, who is a former Bank of England staffer. He told Bloomberg TV that the Bank will \u201cwant to send a message to the markets that they are ready to act\u201d. Rossiter adds that the BoE will probably \u201clook through the inflationary shock\u201d caused by a much weaker currency, rather than hike interest rates to cool prices (as this would hurt economic demand). Bloomberg has polled the City, and confirmed that a majority of economists predict a rate cut at noon today. But a significant majority believe the Bank of England will hold off until they have more information about how the economy is faring. Here\u2019s the details: Thirty of 54 economists asked by Bloomberg predict a reduction, with the majority of those seeing a cut to a record-low 0.25 percent. Still, a lack of data on the outlook means 24 of those surveyed see no change this month. More here: Bank of England Rate Cut in Focus as Brexit Rattles Economy The pound is rallying his morning, up three-quarters of a cent against the US dollar at $1.322. That suggests traders aren\u2019t expecting a massive new stimulus boost from the Bank of England (as this would typically weaken the currency). Investors may also be reassured that Britain now has a new prime minister, and will soon have a new cabinet. That provides more certainty, despite one surprising appointment.... Philip Hammond is now speaking on Sky News, as his whistle-stop tour of the TV studios continues. He warns that the UK economy has \u201ctaken a shock\u201d, as businesses and consumers weren\u2019t expecting the public to vote to leave the European Union. The number one challenge is to stabilise the economy, send a message that Britain is \u201copen to business\u201d. He adds: We are not turning our back on the world. We are determined to maintain our outward-looking stance, and determined to maintain the prosperity of our people. Britain\u2019s new finance minister has given the Bank of England a vote of confidence, as it prepares to possibly cut interest rates. Philip Hammond has told the BBC that Mark Carney is doing an \u201cexcellent job\u201d, and revealed he\u2019ll be meeting the governor this morning. He also warned that the UK economy is already suffering from Brexit uncertainty. Hammond has also confirmed that he won\u2019t deliver an \u2018emergency budget\u2019 in the next few weeks. \u201cThe prime minister made clear we will do an autumn statement in the usual way in the autumn and we\u2019ll look carefully over the summer at the situation. I\u2019m seeing the governor of the Bank of England this morning and we\u2019ll take stock of where we are.\u201d The emergency budget idea was floated by his predecessor George Osborne - who has been relegated to the back benches. Good morning. There\u2019s one question on the lips of investors worldwide - will the Bank of England slash UK interest rates to fresh record lows today? With Britain at risk of recession following the Brexit vote, many economists in the City are predicting that rates will be cut to 0.25% at noon London time. That would end a seven-year stretch in which borrowing costs have been pegged at 0.5%. Governor Mark Carney has already given clear signs that the BoE will act soon. Two weeks ago, he declared: \u201cIn my view, and I am not prejudging the views of the other independent MPC members, the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer.\u201d And as this chart shows, investors reckon there\u2019s an 80% chance of a rate cut today: But it\u2019s not a nailed-down certainty. The Bank of England could decide to leave interest rates on hold today, and wait until August to respond to Britain\u2019s new economic challenges. They also have to consider inflation, which could burst back into life as the weak pound forces up the cost of imported goods (and the UK imports a lot). Rate cuts aren\u2019t the only weapon in Mark Carney\u2019s arsenal. The BoE could launch a new quantitative easing programme \u2013 pumping more money into the economy, by buying bonds from commercial banks. Or it could announce new measures to boost lending to the real economy. The decision comes at noon today, along with the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting. They will give an insight into the Bank\u2019s thinking about the state of the UK economy, and the consequences of the Brexit vote. Expect the markets to move sharply at noon -- especially if the Bank does something unexpected.... We\u2019ll be tracking the build-up to the big decision, and instant reaction and analysis from noon. Plus other key developments in the City and beyond, as Britain\u2019s new chancellor - Philip Hammond \u2013 gets to work.....",

There has been very little hard data since 23 June but the picture will be clearer by the time of the next MPC meeting in early August, which coincides with the release of the Bank\u2019s quarterly assessment of the state of the nation.</p> <p>This will provide forecasts for growth and inflation over the coming months, and provide a justification for whatever the Bank decides to do.</p> <p><strong>Secondly, </strong>the financial market reaction since the referendum has been less acute than looked likely in late June. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/ftse100-enters-bull-market-theresa-may-pm-elect-wall-street-surges-base-rate-cut-hopes\">Share prices have bounced</a>, the pound has stabilised and even edged up a bit on the foreign exchanges, and long-term interest rates have fallen.</p> <p><strong>Thirdly,</strong> the economy has received something of a stimulus from the fall in the pound \u2013 which boosts exports \u2013 and from the Bank\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability\">ease the capital requirements on commercial banks</a>, which increases their capacity to lend.</p> <p><strong>Fourthly, </strong>it is hard to see what material effect a cut in interest rates to 0.25% will have, given that they are already at record low levels. The situation is different now from the aftermath of Black Wednesday in September 1992, when borrowing costs could be cut aggressively from 10%.</p> <p><strong>Finally,</strong> there was a risk that by acting in a kneejerk fashion, the Bank could make matters worse. If consumers and businesses get the impression that the Bank is being rushed into action, it could further dent confidence.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/status/753588851411648512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Good read on the Bank of England&#39;s &quot;cool head&quot; from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a> :<a href=\"https://t.co/m80avg6IpN\">https://t.co/m80avg6IpN</a></p>&mdash; David Jones (@JonesTheMarkets) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/status/753588851411648512\">July 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-14T14:10:21.284Z\">at 3.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57879277e4b033b610b6e014\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-14T13:53:49.974Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>No chance of a quiet August....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/753579850477211649\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoE?src=hash\">#BoE</a> Gov <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Carney?src=hash\">#Carney</a> &amp; MPC have set things up so it really will be a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuperThursday?src=hash\">#SuperThursday</a> on 4 Aug.

That will not be clear until the Autumn, and the MPC should hold fire until then. The MPC still won\u2019t have enough information in August to make a proper assessment of the post-Brexit economic situation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>\u201cLooking further ahead, the MPC needs to recognise that interest rates are already extremely low and have been for seven years. So there is very little that monetary policy can now do to support the economy. We need to look to fiscal policy - government spending and tax measures - and supply-side policies, which aim to make the UK a more attractive environment for business activity, to offset the shock of the Brexit decision.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Arnaud Masset, market analyst at <a href=\"http://swissquote-fx.com/en/research-and-analysis/\">Swissquote Bank</a>, believes the Bank is rightly hesitant to commit to any major moves while the Brexit situation is uncertain.</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This wait-and-see approach is now appropriate, especially given the fact that the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU remains so unclear. The BoE will continue to wait for the smoke to clear before pushing the panic button.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, says it all depends on the data: </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe Bank of England has stayed true to form and today\u2019s decision is consistent with its \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to monetary policy.\u201d</p> <p>As recently as this week\u2019s FPC testimony, Carney was emphasising that the direction of the monetary policy response to Brexit would depend on the relative effects of demand, supply, and sterling. Under this model, the BoE\u2019s decision to hold fire on rates makes sense as there\u2019s not yet enough data to decide on the appropriate response, even if most committee members are clearly leaning towards easing policy. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>City analyst Louise Cooper questions whether a rate cut would actually do any good:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Louiseaileen70/status/753559394302959616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cutting rates from here unlikely stimulate spending<br>May even send -ve msg to consumers &amp; biz<br>Damages bank profits <a href=\"https://t.co/G4bPzLSJqf\">https://t.co/G4bPzLSJqf</a></p>&mdash; Louise Cooper (@Louiseaileen70) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Louiseaileen70/status/753559394302959616\">July 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>James Andrews, Head of Investment Management at Redmayne-Bentley, an investment management and stockbroking firm, cautions that an August rate cut isn\u2019t guaranteed</strong>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt remains to be seen whether we will see a cut next month once the Bank of England have more hard data on the economic impact of the vote to leave.

To that end, <strong>most members of the Committee expected monetary policy to be loosened in August</strong>. </p> <p>The Committee reviewed a range of possible stimulus measures and combinations thereof. It considered the potential interaction between various measures and the financial system, and therefore their influence on output and inflation. Committee members had an initial exchange of views on various possible packages of measures. </p> <p><strong>The exact extent of any additional stimulus measures would be based on the Committee\u2019s updated forecast</strong>. Their composition would take account of any interactions with the financial system and their effectiveness in supporting the domestic economy. Further detailed analysis across all policy areas of the Bank would be required. </p> <p>Against that backdrop, <strong>most members judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting</strong>.</p> <p><strong>For one member, the subdued economic outlook before the referendum had already come close to warranting further stimulus</strong>. The early evidence supported the view that demand was likely to weaken further following the referendum. The resulting outlook for medium-term inflation \u2013 even taking into account the boost from the lower level of sterling \u2013 therefore justified an immediate loosening of monetary policy, to be supplemented by a package of additional measures in August. </p> </blockquote> <p>So, <strong>Mark Carney</strong> then proposed leaving interest rates on hold -- most of the committee backed him.</p> <p>However the newest member, <strong>Gertjan Vlieghe</strong> (a former hedge fund economist) pushed for an immediate rate cut.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57877358e4b033b610b6df65\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-14T11:13:48.586Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank: Brexit vote is now hurting the economy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Bank of England\u2019s agents, who work across the UK, are seeing signs that the economy is weakening.</strong></p> <p>It says:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Official data on economic activity covering the period since the referendum are not yet available.

But it could also restart its bond buying programme and introduce other measures to support lending to households and businesses.</p> <p>However, the swift appointment of a new Prime Minister in the UK means the political situation here is now a lot less uncertain, while the pound\u2019s sharp depreciation in the aftermath of the Brexit vote means import costs are rising which may be passed onto the consumer. So, inflation could be on the rise.</p> <p>Therefore, the BoE may actually hold off cutting interest rates at this meeting or at the very most deliver a small cut \u2013 certainly no more than 25 basis points, in my view.

The real boost to growth will only come with a big burst of public spending on infrastructure, services and benefits \u2013 the areas that have suffered most under austerity. Theresa May has already talked about infrastructure bonds, but she will need to go a lot further than that.</p> <p>That may be ideologically uncomfortable for the Tories, now seeking ways to mitigate economic and social damage from the referendum they called.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 8-1 to keep interest rates unchanged at their record low of 0.5%. Its newest member, Gertjan Vlieghe, backed an immediate quarter point cut but the rest preferred to wait until August, when the Bank is due to release its latest growth and inflation forecasts. This is what economists made of the decision. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist, Pantheon Macroeconomics The committee \u2018discussed various easing options and combinations thereof\u2019, suggesting that a Bank rate cut might be supplemented by more QE. While we continue to expect interest rates to be cut to 0.25% next month, we doubt that the MPC will go further. The case for QE in August will be undermined by the committee\u2019s new inflation forecast, which likely will show a surge in import prices driving inflation above target, perhaps hitting 3% late next year. Since inflation has spent 68% of the last decade above the 2% target, substantial easing would cast doubt on the strength of the MPC\u2019s commitment to its target. In addition, the new chancellor has signalled that fiscal tightening will be scaled back and will be less intense than when the committee has undertaken QE previously. Finally, the Bank of England already has actively intervened to support the economy, by reducing banks\u2019 capital requirements and providing them with virtually unlimited short-term liquidity. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser, PricewaterhouseCoopers The MPC has taken a very sensible decision to keep interest rates on hold. Though political events have been fast moving, there is a need for stable economic policy until we are clearer how the economy is performing in the wake of the EU referendum result. That will not be clear until the autumn, and the MPC should hold fire until then. The MPC still won\u2019t have enough information in August to make a proper assessment of the post-Brexit economic situation. Looking further ahead, the MPC needs to recognise that interest rates are already extremely low and have been for seven years. So there is very little that monetary policy can now do to support the economy. We need to look to fiscal policy \u2013 government spending and tax measures \u2013 and supply-side policies, which aim to make the UK a more attractive environment for business activity, to offset the shock of the Brexit decision. Fabrice Montagn\u00e9 and Andrzej Szczepaniak, Barclays The committee remained consistent with its announced two-step strategy of an initial assessment in July, followed by a \u2018fuller\u2019 assessment in August as well as likely policy easing \u2018over the summer\u2019. What has changed, however, is the split of the vote for the Bank rate decision. Against our expectations, only one member dissented (Gertjan Vlieghe) and voted for a cut in the Bank rate. Alan Clarke, UK and eurozone economist, Scotiabank The return of the unreliable boyfriend: If ever there was a case for abandoning forward guidance and central bankers keeping quiet, this meeting is it. Virtually nobody was going for a rate cut at this meeting before Carney\u2019s intervention a couple of weeks ago. Most assumed that the weakness of the pound and the need to wait for incoming data would lead to a pause at least until August. But for no apparent reason, governor Carney decided to tease the market, let it price in a high probability of a rate cut, only to disappoint. As if the situation wasn\u2019t volatile and uncertain enough, the BoE governor poured petrol on the flames. This was a completely unnecessary intervention. The governor may well argue that the point of forward guidance is for households and businesses and not just financial markets and that the latter should know better. But quite frankly, the governor should know better; he should know that the markets are super-sensitive to BoE communications. The majority of members judged that loosening would be appropriate in August. Why wait?!? They also discussed what form that might take, hence the combination of a rate cut and unconventional policy easing seems likely. Hetal Mehta, senior European economist, Legal &amp; General Investment Management We expected that the Bank of England would hold rates for the time being. We believe it is too early for the Bank to have any meaningful data on how the economy and financial conditions are being affected by the confidence shock ensuing from the EU referendum outcome, and therefore too early to calibrate the appropriate policy response. We expect the Bank of England will make a more comprehensive assessment in August, and that in the coming months interest rates will be cut by 50bps and further measures such as QE and credit easing will be announced. Dean Turner, economist, UBS Wealth Management The Bank of England stood firm today, surprising markets which had been bracing themselves for a rate cut. But this is not the end of the story. Our view is that the Bank of England will begin the process of lowering rates in August, and potentially discuss other measures such as an extension of the quantitative easing programme. We expect to see a measured approach to cutting rates, with gradual decreases over time. Sterling has bounced on the decision to hold rates. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary, TUC The Bank of England has pointed out some worrying signs that the vote to leave the European Union is beginning to affect jobs and investment \u2013 and has been clear about its determination to support the economy in this period. Theresa May\u2019s new government must now take decisive action to make sure that workers do not pay the price for the decision to leave the European Union. That means investing in our infrastructure as the TUC set out in our plan of action to keep the UK economy moving. We need the third runway at Heathrow to be given the go ahead, renewed support for HS2 and plans for more high-speed rail, and a major expansion in housebuilding brought forward as a matter of urgency. Michael Martins, economist, Institute of Directors The Bank of England is playing wait and see for the moment. While the governor has been clear since the Brexit vote that he is poised to act if necessary, it looks like they are waiting to get more data on what is happening in the real economy before making a decision. Next week\u2019s official data releases on the public sector finances, inflation, and labour market, which collectively cover the time immediately before and after the referendum, should help them make up their minds before next month\u2019s meeting of the monetary policy committee. The minutes of the MPC meeting refer to \u2018preliminary signs that the result has affected sentiment among households and companies,\u2019 with \u2018indications from surveys \u2026 that some businesses are beginning to delay investment projects and postpone recruitment decisions\u2019. One of the first surveys was conducted by the IoD immediately after the vote, which showed that a third of members (32%) say hiring will continue at the same pace, but a quarter (24%) will put a freeze on recruitment, and 5% will make redundancies.",

      "bodyText": "Burberry has put the brakes on plans for a new factory in Leeds, as it considers the impact of the UK\u2019s decision to exit the EU, according to the luxury brand\u2019s chairman. Speaking at Burberry\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in Park Lane, London, John Peace said the company was reviewing the delivery time for the designs of its planned \u00a350m manufacturing and weaving facility, as it looked at the \u201ceconomic consequences of what has happened\u201d. He said the factory was still going ahead but the speed of investment might be slowed depending how \u201cevents unfold in the next few weeks\u201d. Burberry had planned to move all 800 manufacturing staff currently based in two separate sites in Castleford and Keighley to Leeds by 2018. Work on the new facility, named Project Artisan, is due to start next year. Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s chief creative and chief executive officer, told shareholders at the meeting that the project was currently \u201con track\u201d and remained a very important part of the group\u2019s strategy. But Bailey\u2019s position is now changing. Earlier this week, Burberry said Bailey would next year relinquish his title of chief executive to Marco Gobbetti, currently the boss of French minimalist brand C\u00e9line. The Yorkshireman will work alongside his now colleague retaining his role as chief creative officer and adding the title of president. At the annual meeting, Peace defended the group\u2019s decision to appointment a chief executive two years after he added the job to Bailey\u2019s creative role. Bailey and Gobbetti will be on similar pay deals and will run the business together in a similar arrangement to the set-up Bailey enjoyed with former Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts who left to go to Apple in 2014. Peace suggested he had handed a joint role to Bailey when Ahrendts left to ensure the designer did not walk away too \u2013 a move shareholders would not have forgiven. \u201cShareholders recognise how important Christopher is to Burberry and have huge regard for what he has done over the years. It was very important that we retained Christopher for the future,\u201d he said. Peace said Bailey had been an \u201camazing CEO\u201d, achieving record earnings and had reacted quickly to \u201cdramatic headwinds affecting the luxury sector\u201d led by a slowdown in spending by Chinese tourists. But he said Bailey now needed to focus on the things he was best at including creative design, online communication and marketing. Bailey will not take a pay cut as Peace said he had not been handed a rise in salary when he took on the chief executive role.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England leaves UK interest rates on hold at 0.5%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.5%, confounding City analysts who expected a recent collapse in business and consumer confidence to convince policymakers to support the economy and cut the cost of credit. By an 8-1 vote, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee also refused to contain the economic fallout from the Brexit vote by expanding its \u00a3375bn quantitative easing scheme. However, the Bank put households on notice that a rate cut was certain if the economic situation failed to improve over the next month. In the minutes of its July meeting, the MPC said that without a return to more normal conditions \u201cmost members of the committee expect monetary policy to be loosened in August\u201d. The Bank warned that it expects \u201csizable falls\u201d in commercial property values in the coming months and also revised down the outlook for house prices. The pound jumped 2 cents against the dollar to $1.334 and rose 1.5c to \u20ac1.20. The FTSE lost some early gains but remained up on the day, ahead 24pts, or 0.4% at 6697. The lack of action by the Bank is likely to disappoint the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, who is seeking to stabilise confidence in the British economy following the vote to quit the EU. But the committee made it clear that it wanted to wait until the economic upheaval caused by the Brexit vote has cleared before taking a decision to cut rates, with only Gertjan Vlieghe, an external member known for his dovish views, voting in favour of further easing by a quarter of a percentage point. Rates have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since 2009, when the country was in the depths of the worst financial crisis in the post war era. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, had already signalled that Threadneedle Street stood ready to unlock fresh stimulus following the Brexit vote, which the Bank believes will trigger an economic slowdown. Speaking a week after the shock Brexit vote, the governor said his personal view was \u201cthe economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u201d. Many City analysts said there was enough evidence of a sharp deterioration in the outlook for the economy for the MPC to cut rates. The MPC said it recognised that business and consumer confidence had fallen steeply before and after the vote while housebuyers had delayed purchases, especially in London and the south-east. Members of the committee also recognised that business investment declined in the two quarters ahead of the vote and the jobs market had also shown signs of weakening, with most employers saying they planned to freeze hiring or cut jobs over the next 12 months. But they said these factors could prove temporary and improve over the coming weeks as the fog of the recent Brexit vote turmoil began to clear. It said: \u201cIn terms of the broader activity outlook, much would depend on the degree and timing of any further retrenchment in business investment, and the flow through to households via the labour market. Both of these were likely to take some time to gauge.\u201d Nevertheless, a rate cut was still on the horizon, the minutes said. \u201cIn the absence of a further worsening in the tradeoff between supporting growth and returning inflation to target on a sustainable basis, most members of the committee expect monetary policy to be loosened in August.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A new bill proposing restrictions on lucrative and controversial government-backed farm promotion programs is expected to be introduced by Utah Republican senator Mike Lee and New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker on Thursday. The move would affect the American Egg Board, the body revealed by the Guardian last year to have used its funds to wage a massive and secret campaign against Hampton Creek, a startup selling egg-free mayonnaise. The law would broadly reform US Department of Agriculture marketing boards that allow small groups of executives, usually representatives from the largest agricultural producers, to spend funds collected from their smaller competitors, ostensibly to promote American farming. Boards supporting sectors of the agricultural industry from eggs to beef to avocados are cited in the new bill. Agricultural marketing programs, or \u201ccheckoff\u201d programs, collect levies on commodities made in the US and use the funds to promote those commodities. But the restrictions on those funds are not always obeyed by the boards themselves, say the senators. The bill would make the budgets of checkoff programs public. It would also require the programs to disclose any use of outside contractors, such as publicity firms or advertising agencies. Lee, a conservative who champions limited government and often criticizes federal programs for \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d, is rarely seen agreeing with the more liberal Booker, but here the issue unites environmentalists and capitalists. In an interview with the Guardian in October, Lee said he was \u201calways on the alert\u201d for \u201canti-competitive behavior, whether it\u2019s a big government advantage or a big business advantage, and here it\u2019s a hybrid of the two\u201d. Lee hinted at the new legislation at the time. \u201cI think Congress has not only the right but the obligation to review laws even passed many decades ago to evaluate how federal authority is being used,\u201d he said. The laws creating checkoff programs were passed in the 1930s. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good sign that two senators who don\u2019t really agree on every issue are coming together,\u201d said Josh Tetrick, CEO of Hampton Creek, who has championed agriculture reform. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the government should be so involved in this, from Lee\u2019s perspective, and from Booker\u2019s perspective, food policy should allow people to eat better and not worse.\u201d The senators say checkoffs\u2019 apparent disregard of established law merited the closer scrutiny: \u201cAlthough the laws establishing checkoff programs broadly prohibit the use of funds in any manner for the purpose of influencing legislation or government action, checkoff programs have been shown to use funds to influence policy directly or by partnering with organizations that lobby,\u201d write the senators in the discussion draft of the bill. In the case of the egg board, Joanne Ivy, who stepped down as CEO of the body late last year, advised Unilever on an ongoing lawsuit against Hampton Creek. Under Ivy, the board retained PR firm Edelman to disseminate pro-industrial farming talking points via food blogs and agreed to try \u2013 ultimately without success \u2013 to have Hampton Creek\u2019s Just Mayo product pulled from Whole Foods, according to emails acquired by Freedom of Information Act (Foia) expert Ryan Shapiro and lawyer Jeffrey Light and passed to the Guardian. In May, several food industry lobbying groups asked Congress to include language in an appropriations bill shielding checkoffs from future Foia requests. In June, a letter to the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) from Lee, Booker and Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal, also a Democrat, said checkoffs had engaged in \u201cbehavior that we believe deserves further scrutiny\u201d, citing \u201cFoia requests regarding activity by federal farm promotion programs\u201d. Those groups are also not representative of all American farmers, especially not farmers without transnational interests. Checkoffs have been sued by producers as recently as two months ago: also in May, a consortium of independent cattle ranchers filed suit against the USDA demanding exemption from their program. \u201cWe are being taxed to promote a message that beef raised without the strict standards used by our members is the same as all other beef, a message we do not support and do not agree with,\u201d the beef farmers wrote. The beef checkoff\u2019s funds, which come from a $1-per-head levy on American cattle, were used to fund a Wendy\u2019s ad campaign. The farmers said they had been forced by the US government to promote foreign competitors; Wendy\u2019s only specifies that its American restaurants use \u201cNorth American beef\u201d, meaning products could be imported from Canada or Mexico. \u201cIn addition, checkoff funds have been used to advance the agenda of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association which promotes the idea that \u2018beef is beef, whether the cattle were born in Montana, Manitoba or Mazatl\u00e1n,\u2019\u201d said Bill Bullard, CEO of the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund (R-Calf), in a statement sent to the Guardian at the time of the suit. The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association was among the signatories requesting the Foia exemption that same month.",

      "bodyText": "Cutting-edge technology \u2013 from intelligent food labelling to mobile phone-controlled apps and even smart fridges \u2013 is set to transform the way consumers shop and control their domestic food waste. On sale for the first time in the UK this autumn is a highly anticipated smart fridge from Samsung. Costing \u00a34,499, the Family Hubrefrigerator is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi. The device has three built-in cameras so owners can check its contents while out shopping. It also includes Alexa, Amazon\u2019s AI assistant, which responds to voice commands \u2013 so you can tell it to turn music on, order more tomatoes and make notes. Sainsbury\u2019s has produced a battery of techno-gadgets that consumers are testing in its pioneering experiment in Swadlincote, Derbyshire. The Waste Less, Save More project aims to reduce food waste by 50% and save the average household \u00a3350 a year. Working closely with Bosch it has introduced 20 smart fridges. With the fridges featuring built-in cameras accessible via a smartphone app, users will be able to check their contents at any time, helping them to avoid over-buying and even zooming in to check use-by dates. The supermarket says a simple change such as adjusting the fridge to the optimum temperature (between 2-5\u00b0C) can significantly increase the length of time foods can be stored. A stick-on \u201cleftover label\u201d that changes colour reminds consumers not to forget their leftovers. For example, green signifies the food is good to eat, while yellow tells that they haven\u2019t got long to reuse the item. Sainsbury\u2019s is trialling these labels in Swadlincote but will be looking at the potential to widen this across all its packaging. Also being trialled is a free food-sharing app, Olio, which helps consumers connect with people in the same area who have leftover food to give away, allowing surplus to be shared and not wasted. Meanwhile, revolutionary new food labelling featuring a tactile bump \u2013 which allows shoppers to tell when perishable food has gone off \u2013 is heading for a further supermarket trial. Its creator, Solveiga Pakstaite, a 23-year-old industrial design and technology graduate of Brunel University, won the UK round of the prestigious James Dyson award for the invention and has since attracted further funding to make her invention a commercial reality. Winnow is an electronic scale that weighs waste as it is thrown away, making it easier to keep track of the volume involved. Currently being trialled in commercial kitchens (and used by the likes of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s River Cottage) Sainsbury\u2019s is looking to introduce this innovative technology to homes in Swadlincote. Meanwhile, in a further development with huge implications for reducing food waste, trials of technology aimed at prolonging the life of fresh produce have proved successful. Raw fruit and vegetables saw their shelf life increase by up to one day in a study involveing produce being sprayed with an electrically charged solution that kills bacteria responsible for spoilage. Testing in cold storage revealed that use of the system, developed at the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, had no effect on the taste or appearance of the produce. UWE\u2019s professor of health and environment, Darren Reynolds, who pioneered the technology said it could be implemented commercially within a year if the food industry is convinced of its benefits. He believes the approach could reduce waste, save millions of pounds and ultimately even play a role in helping resolve world hunger. Under development by the Centre for Sustainable Manufacturing and Recycling Technologies at Loughborough University, is the Pantry app, already tested by volunteers who over a week recorded a description of their food waste, its weight and the reason for discarding it. The functions of the proposed app include a stock list to allow consumers to keep an inventory of when the food was purchased, including expiry (use by and best before) dates. An expiry tracker which operates in parallel with the stock list, linked to an alarm to help notify when items are about to exceed the use-by date. Advanced versions could include recipes for the food left in a fridge-freezer, linked to a meal planner or retailer internet shopping sites for easy purchase of additional items. What our readers told us We asked readers what they were doing to combat food waste. They told us about software and hardware that has been developed to reduce food waste in commercial kitchens and restaurants. Winnow maps where waste occurs and helps chefs know how much food they should be cooking. The technology is used at more than 200 venues in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The company estimates it has reduced CO2 emissions by 2,700 tonnes and saved clients \u00a32m. We also heard about an initiative in Australia, Fair Food Forager, that ranks cafes, restaurants, grocers and suppliers on how sustainable they are. The website and smartphone app gives information to consumers about how the food provider scores on food waste, plastic waste, sourcing local produce, and sourcing sustainable and cruelty-free food. In Italy, Last Minute Sotto Casa (LMSC), which won the 2015 Edison Pulse award to find digital solutions to social problems, works as a digital intermediary between shops with surplus food products and customers who might want to buy them.
