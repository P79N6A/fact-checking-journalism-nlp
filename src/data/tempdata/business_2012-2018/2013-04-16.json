    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Members of the big six group of energy suppliers are paying very low or even no corporation tax despite reaping significant profits from high domestic bills, new research shows, prompting outrage from MPs and calls for reform of the way the industry is regulated. RWE npower, with 6.6 million customers, paid no corporation tax between 2009 and 2011, while Scottish Power paid only \u00a3102m in 2012 on profits of \u00a31.2bn \u2013 even though the lowest corporate tax rate is 20%. German-owned E.ON paid only \u00a3532m in corporation tax between 2007 and 2011 on pre-tax profits of nearly \u00a35bn. French-owned EDF paid \"over \u00a3200m\" last year on pre-tax profits of \u00a31.7bn. The figures are difficult to obtain as most of the companies are subsidiaries of foreign multinationals, and only emerged when Labour's Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, approached each company directly. They have inflamed the public debate on fuel prices at a time when public trust in energy suppliers is at rock bottom. The revelations drew outrage from MPs yesterday, who gave senior executives from the companies an intense and sometimes bad-tempered grilling at a select committee hearing. Ian Lavery, a Labour MP, singled out German-owned RWE npower. \"In the last three years [it has] reported profits totalling \u00a3766m \u2013 yet today they admitted they have not paid a single penny of corporation tax over that period,\" he said. \"People who pay their taxes unquestioningly are sick and tired of seeing hugely profitable companies use every trick in the book to get out of contributing their fair share. Hard-pressed families struggling with sky-high energy bills will be absolutely astonished that an energy company which makes hundreds of millions in profits doesn't appear to be paying its fair share in tax.\" Tim Yeo, chairman of the committee, said: \"I don't think [these companies] grasp the extent of public disgust towards them.\" He said they should have been \"more abject\" in their apologies for mis-selling of products, which resulted in tens of thousands of consumers paying more than they needed to. \"Any consumer watching the proceedings today will not feel those companies have learned their lessons yet.\" The hearing at some points threatened to descend into farce, as the executives became tetchy under increasingly exasperated questioning from MPs, who focused on how public confidence in the industry has been destroyed by soaring prices, over-complex billing and tariffs, the mis-selling of some products that most recently resulted in a record \u00a310m fine for SSE, and accusations of profiteering, as well as the issues of tax. At one point, Labour MP John Robertson, referring to the mis-selling scandals, asked E.ON chief executive Tony Cocker: \"Are you squeaky clean?\" Cocker replied: \"It's too early to say.\" The companies, however, responded that they were investing billions in new UK infrastructure - including new wind farms and other power plants - and that the law allows these to be offset these against tax liabilities. Paul Massara, RWE npower chief executive, said: \"There is a very simple reason why [we have not paid corporation tax for three years] because effectively we have invested \u00a35bn in the last five years building power plants, creating jobs, creating employment, and helping to keep the lights on. If we had not made that investment we would not have the deductibility that we would be allowed. That is a simple accounting UK rule.\" Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, pointed to an Ernst &amp; Young report that found the sector paid proportionately more tax than other sectors compared to its contribution to GDP. She said: \"The energy industry well recognises the role it plays in the economy, investing more, insulating people's homes and by international industry paying its taxes locally.\" Flint said: \"Many of these companies are investing heavily in new generation, which I welcome, and which will enable them to legitimately claim capital allowances to offset against their tax liabilities. Nonetheless I was surprised and concerned to learn that out of Britain's six energy companies, three have effective tax rates significantly less than would be expected, and one appears to have paid no corporation tax at all.\" Part of the problem of working out how much tax energy companies should pay is that the businesses are complex in their organisation. Selling energy to consumers \u2013 the retail market \u2013 is separate from the business of energy generation, and all the major players also have energy trading arms that buy and sell power daily in the \"spot\" and futures markets. Yeo said: \"They can't get away from the concern that they are manipulating these businesses in order to conceal their margins from the consumer. We need more transparency if they are going to win public confidence.\" E.ON said it invested \u00a35.9bn between 2007 and 2011 \u2013 more than it made in profit - and \u00a3885m in PAYE and National Insurance, plus nearly \u00a3500m in climate change levy and \u00a3213m in value added tax. EDF Energy said it invested \u00a31.3bn in 2012, more than its operating profit of \u00a3801m. Centrica, owner of British Gas, has been paying higher tax rates than its foreign-owned rivals: \u00a3651m corporation tax in 2011 on adjusted operating profits of just over \u00a32bn. It paid nearly \u00a3500m of tax in 2010 and over \u00a3400m in 2009 and investing in new infrastructure. SSE, also UK-owned, paid over \u00a3200m corporation tax on profits of \u00a31.3bn. The big six energy suppliers were accused last week of \"cold-blooded profiteering\" after official figures showed they had more than doubled their retail profit margins over the last 18 months and were now earning an average of \u00a395 profit per household on dual-fuel bills. The industry regulator Ofgem, which produced the estimates, said profits per household would reach \u00a3100 over the next 12 months.",

That's on top of the \u00a39.6m he will collect for not being Xstrata's chief executive. The double severance payment is what the contracts dictate (two separate contracts, you see), but Xstrata's non-executive directors were dozing when they agreed those terms. Departing chairman Sir John Bond will not be missed.</p> <p>The interesting subplot is how few of Davis's right-hand men Glencore will keep. Trevor Reid (finance), Charles Sartain (copper), Ian Pearce (nickel), Loutije Smit (alloys), Thras Moraitis (strategy) and Benny Levene (legal) won't be joining Ivan Glasenberg's happy band. That, at least, is an admission that the deal was always a takeover and never a merger \u2013 though, sportingly, today's \"merger update\" maintains the polite fiction.</p> <p>Is it sensible to run Xstrata, a company with 84,000 employees and contractors, without so many current senior operatives? Xstrata sources swear blind that Glasenberg was trying as recently as six weeks ago to persuade Sartain and Pearce to stay. On the other hand, there may be truth in Glencore's view that the truly valuable executives are those running the mines, rather than their divisional bosses.</p> <p>We shall see, but Glenstrata certainly is not a simple business. In terms of numbers of staff, it is now vastly bigger than BHP Billiton, the giant of the mining world as measured by market capitalisation. Glenstrata is also minus a chairman since Simon Murray, who would have stepped aside under the original version of the deal, is no longer credible. The Qataris, whose shareholding now marginally pips Glasenberg's, will presumably have ideas on the right appointment.</p> <p>As for Davis, he clearly intends to be back. He's taken the lease of Xstrata's London office, a place that could comfortably house 50 people. Is he planning a new mining company, a mining investment fund, or something else? Given that he will be leaving Xstrata with the thick end of \u00a375m once share options, share sales and the like are included, he won't be short of seed capital.</p>",

Departing chairman Sir John Bond will not be missed. The interesting subplot is how few of Davis's right-hand men Glencore will keep. Trevor Reid (finance), Charles Sartain (copper), Ian Pearce (nickel), Loutije Smit (alloys), Thras Moraitis (strategy) and Benny Levene (legal) won't be joining Ivan Glasenberg's happy band. That, at least, is an admission that the deal was always a takeover and never a merger \u2013 though, sportingly, today's \"merger update\" maintains the polite fiction. Is it sensible to run Xstrata, a company with 84,000 employees and contractors, without so many current senior operatives? Xstrata sources swear blind that Glasenberg was trying as recently as six weeks ago to persuade Sartain and Pearce to stay. On the other hand, there may be truth in Glencore's view that the truly valuable executives are those running the mines, rather than their divisional bosses. We shall see, but Glenstrata certainly is not a simple business. In terms of numbers of staff, it is now vastly bigger than BHP Billiton, the giant of the mining world as measured by market capitalisation. Glenstrata is also minus a chairman since Simon Murray, who would have stepped aside under the original version of the deal, is no longer credible. The Qataris, whose shareholding now marginally pips Glasenberg's, will presumably have ideas on the right appointment. As for Davis, he clearly intends to be back. He's taken the lease of Xstrata's London office, a place that could comfortably house 50 people. Is he planning a new mining company, a mining investment fund, or something else? Given that he will be leaving Xstrata with the thick end of \u00a375m once share options, share sales and the like are included, he won't be short of seed capital.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays has failed to win the all-clear from a powerful investors' group about the way it is using complex financial instruments to raise capital and pay its bankers. The Association of British Insurers, whose members control some 15% of the stock market and were involved in last year's revolt over pay at Barclays, has issued an \"amber top\" alert, urging investors to think twice before backing the bank, before its crucial shareholder meeting in the Royal Festival Hall on 25 April. The Barclays AGM will be the first meeting chaired by Sir David Walker, appointed after the Libor rigging scandal which forced out his predecessor, Marcus Agius, the chief executive, Bob Diamond and the chief operating officer, Jerry del Missier. The finance director Chris Lucas is also to depart after his successor is named. In the notice of the annual meeting, Walker writes: \"The circumstances of my appointment as chairman are well known. You will have your own views and questions on the events of last year and on our strategy of becoming the go-to bank, and we encourage you to use the meeting as opportunity to express these by attending, raising questions and voting\". The association is highlighting a decision by Barclays to issue contingent capital bonds \u2013 knowns as CoCos \u2013 which convert into shares if the bank runs short of capital to bolster its financial strength and pay bonuses to staff. The association is understood to be warning on a technical matter involving the way CoCos could potentially dilute the interests of existing shareholders by forcing new shares to be issued if the bank's capital levels fall short. Another body which advises investors on how to vote at annual meetings \u2013 the ISS \u2013 has also raised the issue of these so-called CoCos, which regulators are encouraging banks to use. However, it has concluded that Barclays has taken steps to mitigate any risk of dilution for existing shareholders. Separate resolutions related to the bank's ability to issue new shares are being put to investors at the annual meeting because of the issue of CoCos, on top of the usual resolutions on the remuneration report and the election of directors. ISS has also recommended investors vote in favour of the remuneration report while flagging the termination payout of \u00a32.4m for Diamond. ISS acknowledges that the company has made \"several positive changes\" on pay policies even though it paid out \u00a31.8bn in bonuses \u2013 compared to \u00a31.4bn paid out in dividends. Advisory body Pirc has recommended voting against the remuneration report. Barclays on Tuesday restated its results for 2012, because of new accounting rules and a decision to redistribute head office costs into individual businesses. Pretax profit in 2012 would have been \u00a37.6bn under the new rules compared with the \u00a37bn published while the crucial core Tier 1 capital ratio was restated as 10.8%, down slightly from 10.9%. The outcome of the meeting on Thursday may be indicator of whether there will be re-run of last year's \"shareholder spring\" when a record number of remuneration reports were voted down. At Barclays 31.5% of investors failed to back its pay plans. Leading investment group Standard Life last week spoke out at the BP annual meeting and in the coming weeks many companies will face potentially hostile annual meetings, including Trinity Mirror which paid its chief executive Sly Bailey \u00a32.3m after her departure. She was ousted as chief executive during last year's shareholder spring. Pharmaceutical company Astra Zeneca is also facing dissent over the signing-on fee for Pascal Soirot, its new chief executive. Soirot replaced David Brennan, who was also forced out by shareholders last year. The ABI has three levels of warnings \u2013 a red top to indicate serious levels of corporate governance concerns, an amber top which is a less severe alert and a blue top which indicates no obvious breaches of corporate governance codes.

      "bodyText": "Fewer than one in 10 voters back a swift return of Royal Bank of Scotland to the private sector and more than three-quarters believe it should stay in public hands for the time being, according to a new YouGov poll. Two-thirds of voters also believe the former bosses of the bailed out banks should hand back their knighthoods and other honours. Sir James Crosby, who was heavily criticised by a parliamentary committee two weeks ago for his role in the demise of HBOS has volunteered to hand back his knighthood. The government is understood to be keen to kickstart the selloff of part of its 82% stake in the bailed out RBS before the general election in May 2015, even though \u2013 on current prices \u2013 this would involve a loss of around \u00a320bn. Two months ago David Cameron admitted the government was examining an \"interesting\" idea that would involve shares in the bank being handed to taxpayers. But only 9% of respondents told YouGov they would favour \"a sale in the near future\" to recoup whatever money is available now. Some 44% favour holding on to the stake in the hope that the share price will eventually climb, while a large minority of 32% favour holding on to RBS \"for the forseeable future\" and running the Edinburgh-based institution \"as a nationalised bank\". Together, that means 76% are against the option of early disposal \u2013 a crushing overall majority. The YouGov data was produced for the Wednesday conference , at which the Guardian is a media partner. The polling and research group also asked the public for views on whether the former bosses of busted banks should lose their honours: 66% agreed they should, with 16% saying they should be able to keep their awards. YouGov also tested the levels of support for Europe's proposal to cap bankers' bonuses at 100% of annual salary, or 200% with shareholder approval. The legislation was passed by the European Parliament on Tuesday. The idea was supported by 15% of respondents - with 58% demanding a lower cap. Some 6% supported the principle, but with a higher cap. Just 9% said the EU was wrong to seek to impose a limit at all. Five years on from the financial crisis, City bankers remain the least trusted of all trades in Britain apart from journalists on redtop tabloids. Only 13% of respondents told YouGov that they trusted investment bankers in the City \u2013 compared with 12% who trust redtop reporters, who have long occupied bottom place in the trust table. Staff in local banks are very much more trusted \u2013 some 67% of respondents expect them to mostly tell the truth. Voters also accept that banking is crucial to recovery \u2013 27% believe it is vital to UK growth, making it the second most important of all industries, after construction. At the same time, however, 48% believe banking is also holding back Britain's recovery with the second slot (at 41%) occupied by government departments. The YouGov report \u2013 which mixes polling of ordinary voters, with surveys of opinion formers, and off-the-record interviews with bankers themselves \u2013 pinpoints salaries and bonuses as the heart of banking's image problem. More than eight in 10 say excess pay is problematic. A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: \"The banks accept that the industry needs to change, and the sector has been working hard over the last few years to reform. Since the crisis, almost every aspect of the industry has changed, and there is still more to be done.\" Fieldwork on RBS, the EU salary cap and banking honours was conducted online between 11-12 April, 2013, and total sample size was 1,982 British Adults. The data has been weighted and the results are representative of all British adults aged 18 or over. Ahead of the conference, YouGov also conducted three additional surveys with nationally representative samples of UK adults, totalling 11,089 individuals.",

      "body": "<p>Fewer than one in 10 voters back a swift return of Royal Bank of Scotland to the private sector and more than three-quarters believe it should stay in public hands for the time being, according to a new YouGov poll.</p> <p>Two-thirds of voters also believe the former bosses of the bailed out banks should hand back their knighthoods and other honours. Sir James Crosby, who was heavily criticised by a parliamentary committee two weeks ago for his role in the demise of HBOS has volunteered to hand back his knighthood.</p> <p>The government is understood to be keen to kickstart the selloff of part of its 82% stake in the bailed out RBS before the general election in May 2015, even though \u2013 on current prices \u2013 this would involve a loss of around \u00a320bn. Two months ago David Cameron admitted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/19/david-cameron-hints-rbs-sell-off\" title=\"\"> the government was examining an \"interesting\" idea</a> that would involve shares in the bank being handed to taxpayers.</p> <p>But only 9% of respondents told YouGov they would favour \"a sale in the near future\" to recoup whatever money is available now. Some 44% favour holding on to the stake in the hope that the share price will eventually climb, while a large minority of 32% favour holding on to RBS \"for the forseeable future\" and running the Edinburgh-based institution \"as a nationalised bank\". Together, that means 76% are against the option of early disposal \u2013 a crushing overall majority.</p> <p>The YouGov data was produced for the Wednesday conference , at which the Guardian is a media partner.</p> <p>The polling and research group also asked the public for views on whether the former bosses of busted banks should lose their honours: 66% agreed they should, with 16% saying they should be able to keep their awards.</p> <p>YouGov also tested the levels of support for Europe's proposal to cap bankers' bonuses at 100% of annual salary, or 200% with shareholder approval. The legislation was passed by the European Parliament on Tuesday. The idea was supported by 15% of respondents - with 58% demanding a lower cap. Some 6% supported the principle, but with a higher cap. Just 9% said the EU was wrong to seek to impose a limit at all.</p> <p>Five years on from the financial crisis, City bankers remain the least trusted of all trades in Britain apart from journalists on redtop tabloids. Only 13% of respondents told YouGov that they trusted investment bankers in the City \u2013 compared with 12% who trust redtop reporters, who have long occupied bottom place in the trust table. Staff in local banks are very much more trusted \u2013 some 67% of respondents expect them to mostly tell the truth.</p> <p>Voters also accept that banking is crucial to recovery \u2013 27% believe it is vital to UK growth, making it the second most important of all industries, after construction. At the same time, however, 48% believe banking is also holding back Britain's recovery with the second slot (at 41%) occupied by government departments.</p> <p>The YouGov report \u2013 which mixes polling of ordinary voters, with surveys of opinion formers, and off-the-record interviews with bankers themselves \u2013 pinpoints salaries and bonuses as the heart of banking's image problem. More than eight in 10 say excess pay is problematic.</p> <p>A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: \"The banks accept that the industry needs to change, and the sector has been working hard over the last few years to reform. Since the crisis, almost every aspect of the industry has changed, and there is still more to be done.\"</p> <p><em>Fieldwork on RBS, the EU salary cap and banking honours was conducted online between 11-12 April, 2013, and total sample size was 1,982 British Adults. The data has been weighted and the results are representative of all British adults aged 18 or over. Ahead of the conference, YouGov also conducted three additional surveys with nationally representative samples of UK adults, totalling 11,089 individuals. </em></p>",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne is under mounting pressure to moderate his austerity strategy after the International Monetary Fund went public with fears that the pace of budget cuts is too severe for Britain's ailing economy. The fund said it would be holding talks with the chancellor about his tax and spending plans in the wake of gloomy forecasts that subjected the UK to the biggest growth downgrade of any developed country for 2013 and 2014. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's chief economist, singled out Britain as a country that needed to adopt a less aggressive approach to deficit reduction. Speaking at the release of the fund's half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO), Blanchard said: \"In the face of very weak private demand, it may be time to consider adjustment to the original fiscal plans.\" The call came after the IMF shaved 0.3 points off both its 2013 and 2014 growth forecasts for the UK, saying it now expected the economy to expand by 0.7% this year and by 1.5% in 2014. Until now, the IMF has hinted that the government might need to reassess its approach but stopped short of telling Osborne to change course.

They added that America's deficit reduction in 2013 would be far more rapid than Britain's. Eagerly awaited growth figures for the UK are due out next week but regardless of whether they show Britain in an unprecedented triple-dip recession, the IMF said recovery was progressing slowly, constrained by the weakness of trade and attempts to reduce the government's budget deficit. \"Domestic rebalancing from the public to the private sector is being held back by deleveraging, tight credit conditions and economic uncertainty, while declining productivity growth and high unit labour costs are holding back much-needed external rebalancing,\" the WEO said.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap things up for the day here - but do check out the website tonight for more news from the IMF's meetings in Washington. Here's a closing summary: \u2022 The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecasts for economic growth this year, in the latest warning that the world economy is struggling. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF lowered its world growth forecast to 3.3%, from 3.5%. It also expects a deeper recession in the eurozone (-0.3%, from -0.2%), and slightly less growth in the US this year (+1.9%, from 2.0%) (see 2.07pm onwards). The IMF said the global outlook is slightly more positive than last autumn, but warned of a 'bumpy road ahead'. \u2022 The IMF lowered its forecast for UK growth this year to just 0.7%. It also urged chancellor George Osborne to consider changing the pace of his fiscal reform plans (see 2.01pm) It pointed to the weakness of the economy, particularly the private sector, with chief economist Olivier Blanchard saying tonight that Osborne is 'playing with fire'. (see 5.06pm) \u2022 Fears over the global economy had already driven the oil price down, with a barrel of Brent crude costing less than $100 for the first time in nine months. \u2022 German analysts and economists are also more worried about the situation. The monthly ZEW index posted a surprise fall this morning, with global trade and the Cyprus bailout blamed (see 10.11am). \u2022 The ZEW index helped to push shares down in Europe again today. The major indices all fell, with traders warning that the eurozone economy could be weaker than previously thought (see 4.53pm for closing prices). \u2022 Cyprus's president piled more pressure on the country's central bank governor. He attacked the Bank of Cyprus's conduct in a letter to ECB president Mario Draghi (see 3.59pm) \u2022 An opinion poll showed that Germany's new eurosceptic party has the support of around 3% of the country's voters - not enough to win seats in the Bundestag (see 11.17am). \u2022 The latest inflation data showed that the cost of living in the UK remained unchanged, at 2.8% (as measured by the CPI). Economists predicted that CPI will soon be back above 3%. (see 9.32am onwards). In the eurozone, inflation fell slightly (see 10.02am) while in the US the cost of living actually dropped on a month-on-month basis (see 1.44pm). I'll be back tomorrow - until then, thanks and goodnight! The IMF's Olivier Blanchard has increased the pressure on George Osborne, telling Sky News this evening that the chancellor is 'playing with fire', and should considering changing his plans: Shares have risen on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 both recovering some of yesterday's losses. Both indices had fallen in late trading on Monday, following the news of the fatal Boston Marathon bombing. Dow Jones: up 128 points at 14,727, + 0.88% S&amp;P 500: up 15 points at 1,567, +0.98% Traders held a moment of silence for the victims of yesterday's attack and their families, before the session started. Stock markets in Europe have closed for the day, with the major indices posting small losses. The gold price hasn't managed much of a recovery today, currently up 1.1% at $1,376 per ounce (having tumbled 9% on Monday). And the oil price remains under pressure, with a barrel of Brent crude trading at $98.98, having dropped below $100 for the first time in 9 months this morning. Here's the closing prices: FTSE 100: down 39 points at 6304, -0.6% German DAX: down 21 points at 7,690, -0.28% French CAC: down 17 points at 3692, - 0.48% Italian FTSE MIB: down 96 points at 15,533, -0.6% Spanish IBEX: down 65 points at 7,948, -0.8% This morning's drop in German economic confidence (see 10.11am) has helped to push shares down. Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said the ZEW index had fuelled concern that Germany's recovery is faltering. While we still see Germany easily outperforming the rest of the euro-zone this year, we think that a strong and sustained recovery is too much to hope for. We maintain our forecast for the economy to stagnate this year and grow by just 0.5% in 2014. The International Monetary Fund's warning to the UK over the pace of its fiscal adjustment (see 2.01pm) has triggered a political clash between the UK government and the Labour opposition. The Treasury first. It downplayed the IMF's concern, pointing out that Britain's growth forecasts for this year are better than Europe's two biggest economies. A spokesman said: Today\u2019s report from the IMF highlights the risks that continue to face economies around the world. Though the UK is forecast to have stronger growth than either France or Germany in 2013, difficulties in the euro area are still creating economic headwinds. However, as the Chancellor said at the Budget, we are slowly but surely fixing this country\u2019s economic problems. The deficit is down by a third, a million and a quarter new private sector jobs have been created and because of the credibility the Government has earned, families and businesses are benefitting from near-record low interest rates. Thus sidestepping the IMF's call for the government to consider a change.... ...to the chagrin of Ed Balls, shadow chancellor. Balls responded thus: It was a serious mistake for George Osborne to totally ignore the IMF\u2019s calls for a reassessment of fiscal policy in the Budget. They are right to step up their warnings and insist that a change of economic policy is considered right now. \u201cOur economy has flatlined for two and a half years, real wages are falling month by month and the result is \u00a3245 billion more borrowing than planned to pay for this economic failure. How much more damage needs to be done before the Chancellor finally acts? Balls pointed out that the IMF had predicted growth of 2% for 2013 a year ago - but now expects GDP to expand by just 7%. These downgraded growth forecasts are yet another damaging blow to a downgraded Chancellor whose economic policies have totally failed. Back in the eurozone... the battle over the future of Cyprus's central bank governor has taken another twist. The president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, has written to Mario Draghi, telling the ECB president that the country's central bank failed to perform its duties in the run-up to the crisis. The letter is a rebuttal to Draghi's warning last week that national central bank governors cannot be sacked unless they are \"guilty of serious misconduct\" or can no longer perform their duties. Reuters has the details of the letter, apparently sent yesterday: The governor of Cyprus's central bank failed to regulate its now-crippled banking system effectively, the island's president Nicos Anastasiades said in a letter to ECB chief Mario Draghi. Deepening a row between the government and central bank, Anastasiades attacked Panicos Demetriades, who was appointed as governor last year, for what he said was sustaining an insolvent bank using a European Central Bank cash lifeline. The president also said there were damaging delays in resolving problems in the banking sector, after depositors were slapped with massive losses to fund a state bailout last month. In an April 15 letter to ECB President Draghi, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Anastasiades speaks of \"shortcomings of the Central Bank of Cyprus\". Speaking of Draghi, his appearance at the European Parliament didn't bring MEPs flocking: This map, from the World Economic Outlook, shows which parts of the world economy should expand strongly this year (dark blue), which should manage solid growth (light blue), which will grow slower (yellow) or struggle (orange), and which will actually contract (red). You can see why the IMF remains so concerned about Europe. Duncan Weldon, the TUC's senior policy officer, points out that the IMF's new forecasts for the UK are actually slightly more upbeat than official predictions for 2013, but more pessimistic for 2014: Economics editor Larry Elliott has also analysed the report, and confirms that Europe's woes continue to alarm the IMF: He writes: Prolonged stagnation in the eurozone \u2013 GDP falls by 0.3% this year after a 0.6% drop in 2012 \u2013 is worrying in itself but it also has knock-on consequences for the rest of what the Fund sees as a three-speed global economy. In the first division are the emerging economies, which are exploiting their ability to catch-up with the countries of the developed world. They should see growth of more than 5% this year, similar to last year's performance. The second division includes the US, Canada and Japan \u2013 even though the IMF clearly believes the stop-at-nothing reflationary strategy adopted by the new government in Tokyo is \"risky\" given the high level of public debt and the absence of a credible plan for putting the public finances back into some sort of order. Finally, there is Europe, firmly in division three and with no immediate prospect of promotion. Full analysis here: Eurozone crisis clouds IMF's improving outlook Our full story about the IMF's warning to the UK is online here: George Osborne should ease off on austerity, IMF warns The IMF will hold talks with the UK government over how the fiscal adjustment programme could be slowed. From Washington, economics editor Larry Elliott reports: Blanchard just singled out the UK as acountry that needs to show more flexibility on austerity. \"In the face of very weak private demand it is time to consider adjustment to the original fiscal plans,\" Blanchard said. Blanchard added that the IMF will hold discussions with the UK over the coming months to \"see what can be done\" about pace of deficit reduction. The IMF conducts an annual health check on the UK, which gives it a forum to raise its concerns. Previously, the IMF has backed George Osborne's strategy while cautioning that a rethink might be needed if the economic situation worsened. With UK GDP shrinking again in the last three months of 2012, that moment has apparently arrived. Back to the IMF briefing in Washington: chief economist Olivier Blanchard has told reporters that the risk that the eurozone might not stick together has \"disappeared\" due to measures from the European Central Bank and the European Union. However, there is \"a further urgent need to strengthen banks without weakening sovereigns\", he added. In other news, Mario Draghi is testifying at the European Parliament now. The president of the European Central Bank is telling MEPs that it is vital to deliver closer economic and monetary union. Live stream here. The top-line message from the International Monetary Fund is that the world economy has improved since last October, but there's still plenty of problems. As it puts it: Global prospects have improved again but the road to recovery in the advanced economies will remain bumpy. The IMF is relieved that policymakers in 'advanced economies' have successfully \"defused\" the threat of a breakup of the euro area and a sharp US fiscal contraction cut to the \u201cfiscal cliff\". But, it warns that \"old dangers remain and new risks have come to the fore.\". And the eurozone continues to be top of the list: In the short term, risks mainly relate to developments in the euro area, including uncertainty about the fallout from events in Cyprus and politics in Italy as well as vulnerabilities in the periphery. You can download the IMF World Economic Outlook from its website: Chapter 1: Global Prospects and Policies Chapter 2: Country and Regional Perspectives Click here to see an overview of the IMF's projections: Other key points from the IMF. It also expects France to shrink by 0.1% this year, Italy to contract by 1.5% and Spain to shrink by 1.6%. And as expected (following last Friday's leak), it has cut its forecast for US growth this year to 1.9% (from 2%). The IMF is presenting its new World Economic Outlook at a press conference in Washington - you can see it live here: The IMF has taken the red pen to most of its economic forecasts, admitting that the global recovery is weaker than expected. It has cut its forecast for global growth to 3.3%, from 3.5% in the previous World Economic Outlook. And it now expects the eurozone to shrink by 0.3% this year, worse than the 0.2% contraction expected before. Breaking: The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecasts for the UK and urged George Osborne to reconsider the pace of his austerity programme. The warning comes in the IMF's new World Economic Outlook figures, just released. From Washington, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: George Osborne has been told by the International Monetary Fund to re-think the pace of his deficit reduction plan after the Washington based institution cut its forecast for UK growth in both 2013 and 2014. The IMF\u2019s flagship publication \u2013 the half-yearly World Economic Outlook \u2013 provided fresh ammunition for the chancellor\u2019s Labour critics when it said the Treasury should contemplate being flexible about its austerity strategy. In its latest forecasts, the Fund said gross domestic product in the UK would rise by 0.7% this year and by 1.5% in 2014 \u2013 in both cases a cut of 0.3 points from its last set of predictions in January. The warning comes a week before the latest GDP data shows if Britain is in a triple-dip recession. The IMF warned that the UK recovery was progressing slowly. Here's the key statement on the UK, explaining why Osborne should consider changing course. Domestic rebalancing from the public to the private sector is being held back by deleveraging, tight credit conditions and economic uncertainty, while declining productivity growth and high unit labour costs are holding back much needed external rebalancing. ...In the UK, where recovery is weak owing to lacklustre demand, consideration should be given to greater near-term flexibility in the fiscal adjustment path. The IMF is presenting the full World Economic Outlook in Washington now.... The number of new housing starts in the US has jumped to the highest level since June 2008 (three months before Lehman Brothers Failed). The number of housing plots where work actually began jumped by 7% in March to 1.036 million, suggesting the housing recovery is strengthening. The cost of living actually fell last month in America, according to the latest inflation data just released. On a month-on-month basis, the consumer prices index was down by 0.2% in March vs February - mainly due to falling gasoline prices. Inflation was also lower than expected on an annual basis, with CPI up by 1.5% compared with March 2012. For comparison, eurozone CPI came in at 1.7% this morning (here) while in the UK it remained at 2.8% (from here). The European Parliament has given its approval to new rules for the banking sector, which include restrictions on bonuses - pegging them at 100% of annual salary. AP has the story: The European Parliament on Tuesday voted in favor of financial reforms, including a new law to cap bankers' bonuses. The rule limits bonus payments at one year's base salary, or double that if a large majority of a bank's shareholders agrees. It will come into force next year and will also apply to European units of foreign banks and the employees of EU banks working overseas in New York, for example. Lawmakers in Strasbourg overwhelmingly backed the proposed law and passed a sweeping package of financial laws that will force banks in the 27-nation European Union to strengthen their capital buffers. \"We are making our banks more resilient to crises with today's decision so that they no longer have to be bailed out with taxpayers' money,\" said Othmar Karas, a leading conservative lawmaker who oversaw the legislation. The new reforms detailed in a 1,000-page document also lay important groundwork for the creation of a centralized banking supervisor for the eurozone, a cornerstone of the 17-country currency bloc's effort to tackle its debt crisis. The package of financial reforms which implement the internationally agreed Basel III rules were hammered out earlier this year after months of arduous negotiations between EU governments, the EU Commission and parliament. They now have to be implemented in national law by next year. Karas called the set of rules the \"most comprehensive and far-reaching banking regulation in the EU's history.\" The different legislative packages were adopted by about 600 European lawmakers, with about 40 or less voting against them. EC president Jose Manuel Barroso and Commissioner Michel Barnier have just issued a statement welcoming the move. Here's a flavour: These new rules will strengthen the internal governance of banks. Remuneration policies will have to be aligned with sound and effective risk management. Shareholders are given a special responsibility and an appropriate and reasonable maximum ratio is introduced between the fixed salary and the bonus for all risk takers. Critics of the plan, though, claim it will drive up basic salaries and make bankers less accountable for performance.... Meanwhile on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs has just smashed analyst expectations with its results for the first three months of 2013. Goldman posted earnings per share of $4.29, against expectations of $3.88. And net revenues from investment banking were 36% higher than a year ago. CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Goldman was 'pleased' with its performance, but claimed the firm isn't immune to the wider economic ills. He warned shareholders: The potential for macro-economic instability was felt in the quarter and constrained overall corporate and investor activity. Still, it's a sharp contrast with the gloom in much of Europe. Just 90 minutes until the International Monetary Fund releases its latest World Economic Outlook, and anticipation is building... Economist Nouriel Roubini has warned that today's drop in optimism among German economists and analysts confirms that the eurozone 'malaise' has reached Germany: Looking back at the markets, and Brent crude oil remains below the $100 mark. As this graph shows, the oil price has been on a downward path since early February, before recent disappointing economic data provided the latest push: Europe's major indices are still in the red, with the DAX falling further after the ZEW index showed that economic optimism has fallen in Germany (see 10.11am) FTSE 100: down 33 points at 6310, -0.5% German DAX: down 42 points at 7669, -0.5% French CAC: down 22 points at 3687, -0.6% Spanish IBEX: down 31 points at 7982, -0.4% Italian FTSE MIB: down 28 points at 15,600, -0.18% The sell-off in London would be sharper, but for a rumour that the drawn-out merger of Xstrata and Glencore has been approved by China. Their shares are up over 5% each - but most of the market is down (79 shares have fallen, versus 21 risers): Germany's new eurosceptic political party has the support of 3% of the population, according to a poll released by the tabloid Bild today. It's the first survey since Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) held its founding conference on Sunday. AfD fervently opposes eurozone bailouts, and will campaign in this autumn's election for the \"orderly dissolution of the euro\". That leaves AfD some way adrift of the 5% threshold to claim seats in the Bundestag - but there's still several months until the elections. The poll also confirms that Angela Merkel's CDU party holds a solid lead over the main opposition group, the SPD: AfD has been criticised by several German politicians since its launch - and Bild itself (no fan of eurozone bailouts) points out that a return to the Deutsche mark would make German exports much pricier. Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who leads the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European parliament, took to Twitter to blast the party today. He called AfD \"suicide for Germany\" and a \"nightmare\" for the rest of Europe.... Rather than loosening Europe's ties, Verhofstaft's solution is closer fiscal integration: A 24-hour strike has been called by all Greek seamen unions today, in protest at the country's austerity programme and a bill that will undermine workers' collective bargaining rights. The walkout, which ends early on Wednesday morning, has left Greek islands without ferry links with the mainland, AP reports. Living In Greece had more details: \u2022 There is usually a last sailing from the islands as many vessels must return to slips in Athens. \u2022 Routes between Greece and Italy are unaffected if the crew is Italian and ports are not blockaded. Some suburban railway employees are also planning to hold four-hour stoppages between 8pm and midnight today, and on Wednesday and Thursday (more here). Germany's ZEW index of economic sentiment has fallen sharply, as fears over the eurozone crisis loom over its largest economy. The ZEW economic sentiment index slipped to just 36.8, down from March's 48.5 (and much worse than expectations) - a sign that optimism is faltering among the economists and analysts surveyed by ZEW. The think tank cited recent disappointing economic data, and the ongoing eurozone crisis. Eurozone inflation data is just in - CPI rose by 1.7% year-on-year in March, that's down on February's 1.8%. That may give the European Central Bank more opportunity to cut interest rates..... City economists are warning that UK inflation will head higher this year. Here's a round-up of early reaction, from Reuters: GEORGE BUCKLEY, DEUTSCHE BANK I do think you are going to see some increases in inflation over the course of the next three or four months. I wouldn't be surprised to see inflation heading above 3 percent. The one uncertain factor is here is how much petrol prices fall over the next few months based on the fact that we've seen lower oil prices and that could actually limit the peak in inflation we originally had at 3.4% or 3.5%.... ROB WOOD, BERENBERG BANK The trend for inflation is probably up, heading to 3% pretty soon. The Bank of England seems unlikely to engage in more asset purchases in the next month or two, with inflation threatening to go into letter-writing territory soon.\" PHILIP SHAW, INVESTEC This is about as close to consensus as you're likely to get. Our view remains that CPI will move above 3% in the coming months. The big question is whether the MPC will look through this and become more aggressive on QE. We suspect it will. At 2.8%, the cost of living in the UK continues to outpace the rise in wages, as economist Shaun Richards points out: And it appears it's partly our fault: Not free websites, of course :) While the consumer prices index rose by 2.8% year-on-year, prices were up by 0.3% during March itself. Here's a chart that breaks down today's inflation data, showing how prices rose/fell last month compared to February, and compared to March 2012. The retail prices index (which includes housing costs) came in at 3.3%, or up 0.4% during March. UK inflation rose by 2.8% year-on-year in March, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (the Office for National Statistics just reported). That's a repeat of February's reading, and in line with expectations. Clothing and footwear showed the largest month-on-month increase, while food and alcoholic beverage prices were down compared with February. Table to follow... We'll also be watching the European Parliament this afternoon, where Mario Draghi is scheduled to make an appearance (at 2pm BST, RanSquawk flags up). The biggest event on the agenda today is the International Monetary Fund's latest forecasts for the world economy. We also have inflation data for the UK, the eurozone, and the US, as well as the ZEW measure of German investor confidence. Some of the data from the IMF leaked last Friday, suggesting it will cut its prediction for US growth (see here), but there should be plenty of other interesting news to cover. \u2022 UK inflation data for March: 9.30am BST \u2022 Eurozone inflation data for March: 10am BST \u2022 German ZEW index of investor confidence: 10am BST \u2022 US inflation data: 1.30pm BST (8.30am EST) \u2022 IMF's latest World Economic Outlook: 2pm BST Europe's stock markets are in the red this morning,. FTSE 100: down 24 points at 6318, - 0.3% German DAX: down 12 points at 7700, - 0.16% French CAC: down 3 points at 3706. -0.1% Spanish IBEX: down 50 points at 1,963, - 0.6% Italian FTSE MIB: down 54 points at 15,574. -0.35% Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, blamed fears over the state of the US and Chinese economies. She also fears more losses ahead - partly because of the eurozone crisis With China disappointing and recent weak data from the US raising serious questions about whether the tax increases and spending cuts suggest a more significant impact on US growth, there seems little to entice investors. And with continuing problems in Europe and the seemingly ever expanding black hole that represents the financial position of Cyprus, investors may be well advised to be more cautious over the coming weeks. An alternative view on gold.... Gold has staggered back off the mat this morning, up around 1.3% at $1,378 per ounce. A crumb of comfort for gold bugs, whose morale and wallets are badly bruised by Monday's slump (gold was trading around $1,560 last Thursday). But few City analysts this morning are predicting a swift recovery. Katie Martin of Dow Jones sums up the latest reaction: Rating agency Moody's has dented China's hopes of a credit rating upgrade this morning, by cutting the outlook to 'stable' from 'positive'. In the latest sign of concern over China, Moody's warned that it had not made much progress in addressing potential bad debts held by its local government bodies. It explained: Progress has been less than anticipated in the process of both reducing latent risks by making local government contingent liabilities more transparent and in reining in rapid credit growth; therefore, some of the upward pressure on the Aa3 rating has eased. Aa3 is the fourth highest rating on the Moody's scale. More here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest developments in the eurozone crisis and the global economy. Concern over the state of the global economy is growing today, as the jitters that hit the markets yesterday continue to reverberate around the trading floors. Brent crude oil has fallen below the $100 a barrel mark overnight, its lowest levels since July 2012. Monday's disappointing growth figures from China are being blamed - with investors anticipating lower demand for oil if (as feared) the global economy is entering a stickier patch. The message this morning is that economic growth may be more elusive than expected (despite the ultra-loose monetary policy we've been showered with since the crisis began). As Myrto Sokou, senior analyst at the Sucden brokerage, explained to AFP: The recent Chinese economic data failed to meet analysts\u2019 expectations and added further pressure to the market that was already showing sharp losses following disappointing US economic data last week. And Jonathan Barratt, the chief executive officer of Barratt\u2019s Bulletin, warned that: There is a level of confidence evaporating from the [oil] market. Of course, lower oil prices could actually help Europe's struggling economies - lowering inflationary pressures and cutting transport costs. But the broader picture remains that the economic picture does not look too great - Monday's Empire State Manufacturing Index, which measures the health of the US manufacturing sector, was also a disappointment. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, warns that shares and commodities are likely to keep falling today: Yesterday\u2019s China inspired sell off looks set to continue this morning in the wake of continued sharp falls in oil, gold and copper prices as investors appear to be starting to lose patience and confidence in the so called global recovery story. Another disappointing US economic indicator by way of the Empire manufacturing survey did nothing to quell these concerns as the run of disappointing US economic data continued. Despite billions of dollars of financial stimulus from central banks worldwide the global growth story still appears to be no closer to showing signs of moving into a higher gear, and if anything continues to misfire like a clapped out old motor vehicle. And to complete the picture, Moody's has lowered its outlook on China from positive to stable (more on this shortly). So, that's the cheery picture this morning - I'll be tracking all the economic news and developments in the euro crisis through the day ...",

      "body": "<p><strong>Tesco</strong> has been trying to regain ground in the UK after it took its eye off the ball with regards to customer satisfaction and investment in its stores.</p> <p>Its full year results on Wednesday provide an opportunity for the supermarket group to update the City on its progress, but it is likely to report the first fall in full year profits for 20 years. And a consumer survey from Espirito Santo may not provide any happier reading. Analyst Caroline Gulliver said:</p> <blockquote> We expect an upbeat tone from management with regards to their UK recovery plan. Espirito Santo's latest UK survey results, however, indicate customer perceptions of Tesco have deteriorated, not improved since November. Hence we take a cautious view on the outlook for Tesco's UK profit in 2014 and believe that a strategy of margin preservation could store up problems for the future. Whilst it might take time for our thesis to play out we reiterate our sell recommendation. <br> </blockquote> <p>According to Espirito's survey of 2,500 consumers, customer perceptions of Tesco's quality, prices, promotions and overall value for money had all deteriorated quarter on quarter and year on year. Gulliver said:</p> <blockquote> \"Horsegate\" has played a part with a net 16% of Tesco customers choosing to shop more elsewhere, at least temporarily, yet it appears Tesco's problems are more fundamental than that. Consumer perceptions of Tesco's quality were already low, pre \"Horsegate\", but the average score customers now give Tesco for quality has slipped to 4.0, meaning Tesco is not only behind Waitrose, M&amp;S, Sainsbury and Morrison but also now Asda and Aldi. This has led to only a net 3% of Tesco customers prepared to highly recommend the retailer to their friends and family, down from 9% in November. What's interesting is that 33% of Tesco customers are happy, it's just that another 30% are not. It seems that Tesco's strategy of being all things to all people is under pressure from competition at both ends of the market. <br> </blockquote> <p>One of the major calls for Wednesday is that Tesco will announce an exit from the US after a poor performance from its Fresh and Easy chain. But Gulliver said:</p> <blockquote> Tesco's international problems do not stop [with the US]. From Brazil to Poland to China we have heard different retailers talk of declining footfall at hypermarkets and whilst some of this pressure is due to the global macro-economic slowdown, we do not see this pressure lifting. We also believe, from our consumer surveys, that there is a structural trend towards consumers preferring local, well priced retailers, and a growing acceptance of shopping for food online. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> Trading profits in the UK will be down from around \u00a32.5bn to about \u00a32.25bn, which is not exactly a disaster, but Tesco will need to convince the City that this step-back is a one-off and that profits will at least stabilise from now on, despite the investment in higher service levels and the lack-lustre like for like sales trend. Longer term, there will be a lot of attention on the plans for putting restaurants and coffee shops into the big Tesco \"Extra\" hypermarkets. But even if the UK looks reasonably OK, notwithstanding the pressure from the inexorable growth of Sainsbury etc, Tesco have problems in Europe and Asia, so there is plenty to keep the bears happy at this stage. </blockquote> <p>Tesco slipped 0.25p to 384.85p in a falling market.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 39.02 points lower at 6304.58 as investors confronted a number of negative factors. The Boston explosions sent Wall Street lower overnight which did not make for a good start to the day, and even though the US markets recovered some of their losses when they opened on Tuesday, there was still nervousness around. A drop in a key German confidence indicator did not help sentiment.</p> <p>However mining shares regained some ground as gold stabilised after its two day slump, and base metals edged higher. So <strong>Fresnillo</strong> finished 81p higher at \u00a311.61 while <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> closed 8.7p higher at 246.8p. <strong>Xstrata</strong> added 19.7p to 986p as its merger with <strong>Glencore</strong>, up 4p at 325.1p, was finally cleared by Chinese regulators.</p> <p>But ahead of results next week, <strong>Arm</strong> was among the biggest fallers in the leading index. The chip designer lost 28.5p to 868p as Liberum Capital issued a sell note.

      "bodyText": "Tesco has been trying to regain ground in the UK after it took its eye off the ball with regards to customer satisfaction and investment in its stores. Its full year results on Wednesday provide an opportunity for the supermarket group to update the City on its progress, but it is likely to report the first fall in full year profits for 20 years. And a consumer survey from Espirito Santo may not provide any happier reading. Analyst Caroline Gulliver said: We expect an upbeat tone from management with regards to their UK recovery plan. Espirito Santo's latest UK survey results, however, indicate customer perceptions of Tesco have deteriorated, not improved since November. Hence we take a cautious view on the outlook for Tesco's UK profit in 2014 and believe that a strategy of margin preservation could store up problems for the future. Whilst it might take time for our thesis to play out we reiterate our sell recommendation. According to Espirito's survey of 2,500 consumers, customer perceptions of Tesco's quality, prices, promotions and overall value for money had all deteriorated quarter on quarter and year on year. Gulliver said: \"Horsegate\" has played a part with a net 16% of Tesco customers choosing to shop more elsewhere, at least temporarily, yet it appears Tesco's problems are more fundamental than that. Consumer perceptions of Tesco's quality were already low, pre \"Horsegate\", but the average score customers now give Tesco for quality has slipped to 4.0, meaning Tesco is not only behind Waitrose, M&amp;S, Sainsbury and Morrison but also now Asda and Aldi. This has led to only a net 3% of Tesco customers prepared to highly recommend the retailer to their friends and family, down from 9% in November. What's interesting is that 33% of Tesco customers are happy, it's just that another 30% are not. It seems that Tesco's strategy of being all things to all people is under pressure from competition at both ends of the market. One of the major calls for Wednesday is that Tesco will announce an exit from the US after a poor performance from its Fresh and Easy chain. But Gulliver said: Tesco's international problems do not stop [with the US]. From Brazil to Poland to China we have heard different retailers talk of declining footfall at hypermarkets and whilst some of this pressure is due to the global macro-economic slowdown, we do not see this pressure lifting. We also believe, from our consumer surveys, that there is a structural trend towards consumers preferring local, well priced retailers, and a growing acceptance of shopping for food online. Meanwhile analyst Nick Bubb said: Trading profits in the UK will be down from around \u00a32.5bn to about \u00a32.25bn, which is not exactly a disaster, but Tesco will need to convince the City that this step-back is a one-off and that profits will at least stabilise from now on, despite the investment in higher service levels and the lack-lustre like for like sales trend. Longer term, there will be a lot of attention on the plans for putting restaurants and coffee shops into the big Tesco \"Extra\" hypermarkets. But even if the UK looks reasonably OK, notwithstanding the pressure from the inexorable growth of Sainsbury etc, Tesco have problems in Europe and Asia, so there is plenty to keep the bears happy at this stage. Tesco slipped 0.25p to 384.85p in a falling market. The FTSE 100 finished 39.02 points lower at 6304.58 as investors confronted a number of negative factors. The Boston explosions sent Wall Street lower overnight which did not make for a good start to the day, and even though the US markets recovered some of their losses when they opened on Tuesday, there was still nervousness around. A drop in a key German confidence indicator did not help sentiment. However mining shares regained some ground as gold stabilised after its two day slump, and base metals edged higher. So Fresnillo finished 81p higher at \u00a311.61 while Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation closed 8.7p higher at 246.8p. Xstrata added 19.7p to 986p as its merger with Glencore, up 4p at 325.1p, was finally cleared by Chinese regulators. But ahead of results next week, Arm was among the biggest fallers in the leading index. The chip designer lost 28.5p to 868p as Liberum Capital issued a sell note. Analyst Janardan Menon said: We expect Arm's US dollar revenues to be broadly in line with guidance ($250m) and consensus estimates, while sterling revenues are expected to benefit from weakness in the currency. Arm had sequentially guided down its first quarter 2013 revenues, following strength in the fourth quarter of 2012. Going forward we expect year on year revenue growth rates to gradually decelerate as smartphone growth moderates. We also remain concerned about potential gains in smartphone and tablet share by Intel and maintain our sell recommendation on the stock. In more detail, Menon added: Our sell recommendation on Arm is based on three factors. 1) an expectation of Intel gaining share in Arm's key royalty markets \u2013 smartphones and tablets. 2) slowing growth rates in the smartphone and tablet markets which are expected to depress Arm's royalty growth 3) The high multiples the stock is trading at relative to its longer term growth outlook.

      "bodyText": "Household incomes are down and yet spending has grown. How? Because the savings ratio is down and borrowing is on the rise again. That Britons are back to their old habit of borrowing to spend is the depressing conclusion we can draw from the latest quarterly survey released by the Office for National Statistics showing the economic position of UK households. In the last quarter of 2012, the ONS says real household income a head (after taking inflation into account) fell by \u00a313 to \u00a33,767. Meanwhile, real household expenditure a head edged up by \u00a34 and the household savings ratio fell back to 6.7% after hitting 7.9% in the third quarter. When figures appear for the first three months of this year the situation is likely to have worsened. Real incomes will be down after another period of low wages rises (around 1% on average) and higher inflation (2.8% last month).

The IMF's flagship publication \u2013 the half-yearly World Economic Outlook \u2013 provided fresh ammunition for the chancellor's Labour critics when it said the Treasury should contemplate being flexible about its austerity strategy. In its latest forecasts, the Fund said gross domestic product in the UK would rise by 0.7% this year and by 1.5% in 2014 \u2013 in both cases a cut of 0.3 points from its last set of predictions in January. Eagerly awaited growth figures for the UK are due out next week but regardless of whether they show Britain in an unprecedented triple-dip recession, the IMF said recovery was progressing slowly, held back by the weakness of trade and attempts to reduce the government's budget deficit. \"Domestic rebalancing from the public to the private sector is being held back by deleveraging, tight credit conditions and economic uncertainty, while declining productivity growth and high unit labour costs are holding back much needed external rebalancing,\" the WEO said.

Not by much, but a bit cheerier than it was six months ago when it was fretting about the eurozone busting apart or the United States imposing budget cuts that would have killed economic recovery stone dead. Those two big risks have, the Fund believes, been greatly diminished. It thinks the US is going about fiscal consolidation too hastily and too clumsily, and wishes eurozone policymakers would get their fingers out and get on with the creation of banking and fiscal unions. But all in all it thinks the doomsday scenarios it was envisaging last autumn are now less likely. So, while 2013 is not going to be a vintage year, with global growth similar to that in 2012, activity will strengthen in the second half of the year and into 2014.

    "webTitle": "Inflation sticks at highest level since May 2012", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The rate of inflation stayed at its highest level for almost a year in March, keeping up the squeeze on consumers. The annual rate of consumer price inflation held at 2.8%, according to official data. That is the highest since last May and in line with economists' forecasts. The Office for National Statistics said the biggest upward pressures last month came from price rises for newspapers, books and digital cameras - including the effect of dearer ebooks, a new item in the basket of goods used to calculate inflation. There was only muted relief from fuel prices which rose by less than a year ago and some easing in food price inflation. The Treasury welcomed the steadying in headline inflation, and economists said recent falls in the oil price and other commodities could mean the rate will not rise as much as previously feared in coming months. But most still expect it to tick higher from here, as does the Bank of England. \"New Bank governor Mark Carney will be welcomed by inflation that is likely to have breached 3% on his appointment in the summer alongside \u2013 perhaps most worrying \u2013 rising inflation expectations,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. With wage growth running at little more than 1% on average, the headline inflation rate is expected to squeeze consumer spending power and dampen growth prospects in coming months. Inflation has been running above the Bank of England's 2% target for the past four years and the central bank believes it will rise further to around 3% during 2013. Minutes from the BoE's latest policy meeting will be published on Wednesday, revealing to what extent its nine-member monetary policy committee remains split over whether to inject more electronic cash to stimulate the economy. The Treasury sought to play down the pressure on households and noted inflation was now almost half its peak of 5.2%. A spokesperson added: \"The government has taken continued action to help households with the cost of living, including increasing the tax-free personal allowance and freezing fuel duty for nearly three and a half years.\" There was some support for the view that inflation will be kept in check over coming months from separate official data showing prices at the factory gate posted their smallest annual rise since last July, helped by a drop in the price paid for crude oil. Output price inflation was in line with City forecasts at 2% in March, the ONS said.

Until recently the answer to this question was simple: not very, and getting worse, while the country as a whole is faltering relative to its competitors. However, recent figures on 'productivity per hour' and per filled job in different areas of the UK show that (while the gap is still wide) between 2009 and 2011 all three Northern regions gained ground on the national productivity rate, while London slipped. Earlier this week, yet more statistics revealed that areas whose economies aren't conventionally thought of as being highly productive \u2013 Blackburn and Darwen, Durham, Blackpool, Bradford, Sunderland and Tyneside \u2013 were also gaining ground.
