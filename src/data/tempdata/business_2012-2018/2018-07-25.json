      "bodyText": "Nearly a fifth of British retailers are planning to cut the number of people they employ in the next three months as the high street continues to suffer from rising costs and a shift to buying online. The number of people employed in the retail sector, the UK\u2019s biggest employer, has already dropped nearly 3% in the past three months, according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Redundancies rose to three times the level this time last year. Helen Dickinson, the trade body\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cRetailers are continuing to reduce labour requirements to support a reinvention in how retail and shopping works.\u201d Retailers remain wary about the future despite a boost to trade for many from the heatwave and England\u2019s unexpected run of success in the World Cup. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) reported a second strong month in which 32% of retailers said sales were up, while 12% said they were down giving a positive balance of 20%, the second highest reading so far in 2018 for the employer organisation\u2019s monthly distributive trades survey. Of the 50 retailers who took part, 8% more expected to cut their orders than those that expected to source more in the month ahead as the majority expect sales growth to flatten off in August. Alpesh Paleja, CBI\u2019s principal economist, said: \u201cWhile the heatwave has boosted retail sales in recent months, we may be seeing some early signs of a cooling off. \u201cIndeed, the long-term challenges facing the retail sector are significant. Continually subdued real wage growth means that households are still feeling the pinch, and retailers are still grappling with deeper structural issues, such as digital disruption.\u201d Retailers also face the rising cost of sourcing goods from abroad following the fall in the value of the pound, alongside a jump in business rates and the legal minimum wage. At the same time household spending remains sluggish, not helped by weak consumer confidence as uncertainty over Brexit continues. The switch to spending online has spurred traditional high street stalwarts including House of Fraser, New Look, Marks &amp; Spencer and Carpetright to close dozens of shops as they try to pump money into home delivery infrastructure and IT. These closures and the collapse of weaker chains, including Maplin, Poundworld and Toys R Us, have put at least 35,000 high-street jobs at risk. The loss of jobs is seen as particularly bad news for women. The BRC says 70% of those who work in retail are female.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our Washington bureau chief David Smith on today\u2019s trade breakthrough: Donald Trump and European Union officials appeared to step back from a trade war on Wednesday as they struck a deal to work toward \u201czero\u201d tariffs, barriers and subsidies. \u201cWe had a big day, very big,\u201d the US president said in the White House rose garden, standing alongside Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, adding that there was a \u201cnew phase\u201d in US-EU relations. Trump and Juncker appear amiable at meeting aimed to avert trade war \u201cWe agree today, first of all, to work together toward zero tariffs, zero, non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,\u201d Trump told reporters. The statement came after Trump had threatened tariffs on car imports and reports that the EU is planning retaliatory measures. Trump said the US and EU will set up an executive working group to work on trade and assess existing tariffs \u201cto the betterment of both\u201d. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re starting the negotiation right now but we know very much where it\u2019s going.\u201d Juncker said it his \u201cintention to make a deal\u201d that would work towards zero tariffs on industrial goods. Trump added: \u201cThis was a very big day for free and fair trade, a very big day indeed.\u201d I\u2019ll be back in the morning to see how the European stock markets react. You might expect a rally.... however, the news that Facebook\u2019s shares have tanked in afterhours trading (it missed Wall Street forecasts and lowered its outlook) could weigh on investors. Goodnight! GW Europe\u2019s commitment to import a lot more liquified natural gas from America is quite interesting. During his visit to Europe this month, Donald Trump blasted Germany for signing up to a new natural gas pipeline link with Russia called Nord Stream 2. Trump claimed the deal made Europe dangerously reliant on Russia for its energy needs - a concern echoed by some experts. So does today\u2019s deal fix that problem? Not according to former US ambassador Anthony Gardner, who doubts whether much more LNG will actually cross the Atlantic... I came, I talked, I got a deal, says Juncker on Twitter: Here\u2019s a video clip of presidents Juncker and Trump announcing they have agreed to work together on trade: European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom says Washington and Brussels have \u201cturned a page\u201d in their relationship. Beijing may be looking at tonight\u2019s deal nervously, says Reuters Noah Barkin: China, of course, is being threatened with tariffs on ALL its US sales, unless it makes concessions on trade. European Commission vice-president Jyrki Katainen has hailed the apparent breakthrough: Professor Steve Peers points out that the two sides have primarily agreed to negotiate on trade, rather than reach a concrete agreement (yet). The BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil isn\u2019t impressed by Trump\u2019s approach Investor Christian Gagnon thinks Juncker has played his cards well: Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters that he had a \u201cgood and constructive meeting\u201d with Donald Trump. He added that the two sides had agreed not to impose any new tariffs while talks were taking place. That might mean that the threat of punitive tariffs being imposed on EU car sales into America may have receded.... Donald Trump also sounds optimistic following his talks with Juncker today. He tells reporters in Washington that the two side have agreed to work together to lower trade barriers Trump declares: \u201cThis was a very big day for free and fair trade, a very big day indeed.\u201d Trump points out that the negotiations are only just starting, but both sides know where they want to get to. That includes working towards \u201czero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods,\u201d says the US president. He adds: \u201cWe will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans; soybeans is a big deal, Europe would also become \u201ca massive buyer\u201d of liquefied natural gas from the United States, Trump adds proudly. The EC says it has launched a \u201cnew phase\u201d in its relationship with the US today. It is: ....a phase of close friendship, of strong trade relations in which both of us will win, of working better together for global security and prosperity, and of fighting jointly against terrorism. The EC adds that it hopes to \u201cresolve the steel and aluminum tariff issues\u201d -- the levies imposed by Donald Trump on European metal imports earlier this year. It\u2019s official: The European Union and the United States have reached an agreement that may calm fears of a trade war between the two sides. The breakthrough was reached during Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s talks with Donald Trump at the White House. The two side have agreed to work together to lower trade barriers, and towards eliminating some tariffs. It will see Europe import more energy, and soy beans, from America. In a statement, the EU says it agreed four key points with the US today: First of all, to work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods. We will also work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans. This will open markets for farmers and workers, increase investment, and lead to greater prosperity in both the United States and the European Union. It will also make trade fairer and more reciprocal. Secondly, we agreed today to strengthen our strategic cooperation with respect to energy. The European Union wants to import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States to diversify its energy supply. Thirdly, we agreed today to launch a close dialogue on standards in order to ease trade, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs. Fourthly, we agreed today to join forces to protect American and European companies better from unfair global trade practices. We will therefore work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state owned enterprises, and overcapacity. More to follow! US shares have jumped in late trading, following the report that Europe has made some trade concessions. The Dow surged by 150 points, on hopes that a trade war can be averted. NEWSFLASH: The Dow Jones newswire is reporting that Jean-Claude Juncker has proposed some concessions to Donald Trump at their talks today. It says the Europeans have \u201cagreed to lower industrial tariffs\u201d and also to \u201ciimport more U.S. soybeans\u201d. We don\u2019t have more details, or confirmation yet.... Sky News have a video clip of Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s remarks at the White House earlier: Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker have now vanished off for their trade talks. The two leaders appeared quite friendly as they sat side by side in the Oval Office. At one stage, Trump even reached over to give Juncker a friendly tap on the thigh. The optimistic noises from the two men have also helped to push shares higher on Wall Street, dragging the Dow Jones industrial average away from its earlier losses. President Juncker thanks Donald Trump for inviting him to the White House for talks on trade. America and Europe are close partners and allies, not enemies, he says, so we have to work together. [reminder, Trump recently claimed the EU was a \u2018foe\u2019 when it comes to trade]. Juncker says that he believes talks should focus on decreasing tariffs, not increasing them. Trump says he agrees! The US would be very pleased if there were no tariffs, barriers or subsidies. We want reciprocal trade at a minimum, he insists, and \u201cwe\u2019re making tremendous strides\u201d towards it. We hope to achieve something good, and when we do you\u2019ll be the first to know, Trump concludes. The assembled press pack then shout questions. Some are on trade, but at least one was about the secret recording of Trump discussing buying the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal\u2019s story about her alleged affair with the president. None of the questions are answered. Donald Trump began by complimenting Jean-Claude Juncker on the way he represents EU citizens. We are looking for a fair trade deal, and hopefully we can sort something out, Trump tells reporters at the White House. The president then claims that America has been losing \u201chundreds of billions of dollars\u201d to the EU over recent years [because it runs a trade deficit with Europe]. We just want a level playing field for American companies and farmers, Trump continues. Something that\u2019s good for everybody, that\u2019s what we are going to discuss. Newsflash: European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has declared that America and Europe are \u201cfriends, not enemies\u2019, as he sits down with Donald Trump for talks on trade. In response, Trump has told reporters at the White House that Juncker is \u201cvery smart\u201d and \u201ctough\u201d, as they prepare to lock horns about tariffs. There\u2019s a media scrum at the White House as reporters prepare to hear from presidents Juncker and Trump. We\u2019re expecting the two men will hold a \u201cpool spray\u201d* in the Oval Office (* - a chance for journalists to ask questions, not a refreshing blast from a hose) Donald Trump limbered up for his talks with Jean-Claude Juncker over trade today, by declaring he would show \u201cNo weakness\u201d. As explained in the introduction, the EU hope to talk Trump away from imposing tariffs on European car imports, but there\u2019s not much hope of a big breakthrough today. Now this is interesting... Donald Trump\u2019s top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, has told Fox News he held constructive talks with EU officials over trade yesterday. That could be an encouraging sign for the Trump-Juncker talks, which are due to start soon in Washington. In London, the FTSE 100 index of top shares has fallen 50 points, or 0.66% today, to close at 7658. Chinese president Xi has fired a warning to the White House not to launch a global trade war. Speaking at the annual summit of BRICS (emerging market) economies in Johannesburg, Xi warned that countries who pursue \u201ceconomic hegemony\u201d will end up hurting themselves Xi declared that leaders must choose between cooperation and confrontation, adding. \u201cUnilateralism and protectionism are mounting, dealing a severe blow to multilateralism and the multilateral trading regime\u201d. Trump, meanwhile has accused China of being \u2018vicious\u2019, by imposing retaliatory tariffs in response to his push for freer trade. Motor racing chief Jean Todt, who ran the Ferrari Formula 1 team for several years, says Sergio Marchionne was a \u201cvisionary leader\u201d. Todt, now president of the FIA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile), writes: \u201cIt is with great sadness that I learned that Sergio Marchionne tragically and unexpectedly passed away. Sergio achieved a colossal amount for the automotive industry and motor sport worldwide. He dedicated himself fully to turn around the FIAT-Chrysler group and put all his energy to bring Scuderia Ferrari back to the top. He was an endearing, upstanding and brave man, an unconventional and visionary leader. He was an eminent member of the FIA F1 Strategy Group and of the FIA High-Level Panel for Road Safety. His death is a considerable loss. On behalf of the entire FIA community, all my thoughts go out to his family, his friends and his Ferrari and Fiat-Chrysler group teams\u201d. Another carmarker, General Motors, has spooked the markets by slashing its profit forecasts. GM blamed rising commodity costs -- following Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports, and 10% on aluminium. That has pushed up GM\u2019s raw materials bill, hitting profitability. Chuck Stevens, GM\u2019s executive vice president and CFO says: Our operating performance was impacted by significant headwinds from commodity costs and currency devaluations in South America. For the rest of the year we will focus on flawlessly executing our full-size truck launches and continue managing the business with discipline in a more challenging environment.\u201d GM now expects to make between $5.80 to $6.20 per share this year, down from $6.30 to $6.60 previously. This makes GM one of the biggest companies to warn that Trump\u2019s trade disputes are hurting business. The warning comes just a few hours before the president sits down with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker for talks to (possibly) stave off a trade war. Wall Street has taken the news badly; shares in GM are down almost 7% today. Italy\u2019s Cgil union has given a guarded tribute to Sergio Marchionne, reports Associated Press: The Cgil union, Italy\u2019s most powerful, praised Marchionne for having \u201csaved a dying company.\u201d But it faulted him for having failed to negotiate with \u201can important sector of Italian workers,\u201d which it said created conflict and divisions that are still being felt. Cgil\u2019s Fiom metalworkers union clashed with Marchionne over changes he brought to Italian plants to increase productivity. Ford\u2019s executive chairman, Bill Ford, says the auto industry will miss Sergio Marchionne badly: \u201cSergio Marchionne was one of the most respected leaders in the industry whose creativity and bold determination helped to restore Chrysler to financial health and grow Fiat Chrysler into a profitable global automaker. His extraordinary leadership, candor and passion for the industry will be missed by everyone who knew him. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family at this difficult time.\u201d The plunge in Fiat Chrysler\u2019s share price can\u2019t be directly attributed to Sergio Marchionne\u2019s death. His long stint as CEO actually ended last weekend, when the company announced his resignation following complications after shoulder surgery. Plus, Marchionne was already expected to step down next year. But..by lowering its profit and revenue forecasts today, FCA has reminded the markets that the auto sector is a tough place for new CEO Mike Manley to navigate. Shares in Fiat Chrysler have tumbled almost 10% at the start of trading in New York, after the firm cut its profit and revenue forecasts for this year. Here\u2019s our news story on Sergio Marchionne\u2019s death: Over in Turin, Fiat Chrysler has lowered its flags to half-mast today, as a sign of respect to Sergio Marchionne. Workers at Fiat\u2019s plant in Pomigliano, Italy, where the popular Panda car is produced, stopped production for 10 minutes, Associated Press reports. Ana Nicholls, Director of Industry Operations at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says the business world has lost one of its \u201cgreatest turnaround managers\u201d. \u201cThe death of Sergio Marchionne marks the passing of one of the greatest turnaround managers of the past century. His legacy is impressive: in saving both Fiat and Chrysler through clever deal-making and sheer hard work he not only ensured the survival two of the most venerable names in the auto industry, but also saved the jobs of tens of thousands of people. Mike Manley has a lot on his place, as he tries to step into Sergio Marchionne\u2019s shoes, she adds: The difficulty is understanding what comes next for FCA. Mr Marchionne famously said there was no script for after his departure and the new CEO, Mike Manley, is having to start improvising more quickly than expected. The departure of the group\u2019s EMEA head, Alfredo Altavilla, on Monday will make his job that bit harder, as will the escalating global trade war. As a Chrysler insider and the head of Jeep, Mr Manley is unlikely to want to follow through on previous rumours that FCA would spin off Jeep, or even sell the whole company. Instead, he will probably continue to put Jeep at the centre of the group\u2019s global strategy, and cement the overall group\u2019s shift away from small cars towards sports utility vehicles. But if tariff barriers continue to rise, he will have to find a way to re-engineer the group\u2019s product line-up so that fewer vehicles and parts need to cross borders, without undermining the savings the group was getting from greater global integration. That may mean fewer big deals and a lot more small-scale restructuring, but either way he will find Mr Marchionne a hard act to follow.\u201d The New York stock exchange have tweeted a nice picture of Sergio Marchionne on the day he floated Ferrari, a key milestone during his time at FCA. Here are a few more photos from the archive: \u2022 This block was amended on 26 July 2018 because an earlier version misnamed Sergio Marchionne as Silvio. Fiat Chrysler Automobile\u2019s new CEO, Mike Manley, has paid tribute to his predecessor, as he presents the car maker\u2019s new financial results to analysts. Manley says FCA learned this morning that Sergio Marchionne had passed away. Clearly this is a very sad and difficult time. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends and colleagues. Manley explains that he worked with Marchionne for many years, so his death is heartbreaking on a personal level. There is no doubt that Sergio was a very special, unique man, and no doubt he will be sorely missed. Manley thanks the analysts for their warm messages and comments since Marchionne\u2019s surgery last week, and then held a minute\u2019s silence. He then confirms that FCA has cut its guidance for this year, following a tougher time in China: Another top automobile boss, Mary Barra of General Motors, says Marchionne created a \u201cremarkable legacy\u201d. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s results show the challenging facing Sergio Marchionne\u2019s successor, Mike Manley. FCA, whose brands include Jeep, Ram, Alfa Romeo, Dodge and Maserati, is aiming to double its profits over the next four years - and also make a bigger splash in the electric car sector. Today\u2019s downgraded forecasts mean that will be a little bit harder. Manley, who took over last weekend after Marchionne\u2019s surgery, will present the results to analysts shortly. Newsflash: Fiat Chrysler shares have just tumbled, after the carmaker released its latest financial results to the markets. The company has reported that earnings shrank by 35% in the second quarter of 2018 (which turned out to be Sergio Marchionne\u2019s final period in charge). Net profits fell to \u20ac754m, down from \u20ac1.155bn a year earlier. The company says that sales in China fell, partly due to increased competition from domestic brands. Fiat-Chrysler has also cut its forecasts for 2018. It now expects net revenues of between \u20ac115bn and \u20ac118bn, down from \u20ac125bn previously. It has also slashed its profit forecasts, predicting adjusted EBIT of between \u20ac7.5bn and \u20ac8.0bn, down from \u20ac8.7bn. This has alarmed investors; Fiat Chrysler shares have slumped by 10%: (The company was scheduled to release its results today, so this isn\u2019t related to Sergio Marchionne\u2019s sad death). ActivTrades analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa says Marchionne turned an \u201calmost bankrupt Fiat\u201d into an international powerhouse. His heritage could be described in just a few numbers: in 2004 when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u2019s revenue was close to \u20ac47bn, today it exceeds \u20ac140bn. The company profit almost trebled in the same period. Loved or hated Marchionne is the man who made FCA as we know it today: more successful and a little less Italian. It is still difficult to imagine FCA and Ferrari without the man and his unique style. He wore a sweater rather than the traditional suite and a tie as his everyday business attire and with is unconventional leadership style he managed to turnaround one of Italy\u2019s biggest \u2013 and often most troubled - industrial realities. The FT\u2019s Henry Foy points out just how much value Sergio Marchionne created at Fiat Chrysler: Back in January, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas made the same point to Marchionne on a conference call: \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen anything like you. You took $2 billion, roughly, and you\u2019ve turned it into around $72 billion, and more important than that, there are many hundreds of thousands of families across many nations that are better off because of you and your team and you beat the sceptics every step of the way. So, I just had to say god bless you, Sergio. Chrysler workers should be grateful that Marchionne took the risk of helping the stricken auto company out of bankruptcy protection in 2009, says Autotrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs: It\u2019s highly unlikely that Chrysler would exist today had he not taken that gamble. The company was in such bad shape, being stripped of any kind of resources by the previous owners.\u201d Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group (the Indian conglomerate), has tweeted his admiration for Sergio Marchionne: There\u2019s a lot of affection for Sergio Marchionne on social media, including from fans of Ferrari (which he chaired until last weekend). Associated Press have dubbed Sergio Marchionne a \u201ccharismatic and demanding leader\u201d. The manager, known for his folksy, colourful turns of phrase and for his dark cashmere sweaters no matter the occasion, was the darling of the automotive analyst community. Even when expressing doubts at his audacious targets, they expressed admiration for his adept deal-making. That included getting GM to pay $2 billion to sever ties with Fiat, key to relaunching the long-struggling Italian carmaker, and the deal with the U.S. government to take Chrysler without a penny down in exchange for Fiat\u2019s small-car technology. Marchionne joined Fiat after being tapped by the Agnelli family to save the company. Fiat had for generations been a family-run enterprise, and having someone at the helm from outside Italy\u2019s clubby management circles even a dynamo like Marchionne was an enormous change. Other key corporate moves included the spinoff of the heavy industrial vehicle and truck maker CNH and of the Ferrari supercar maker. Both deals unlocked considerable shareholder value for Agnelli family heirs led by John Elkann. Elkann came into his own under Marchionne\u2019s stewardship, taking over as chairman in 2010 having been tapped more than a decade earlier by his grandfather, the late Gianni Agnelli, to run the family business. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chairman, John Elkann, has told staff to build on Sergio Marchionne\u2019s legacy, saying: \u201cThe best way to honour his memory is to build on the legacy he left us, continuing to develop the human values of responsibility and openness of which he was the most ardent champion.\u201d Marchionne was one of the boldest business leaders of his generation, says the Financial Times. Here\u2019s a flavour of the FT\u2019s obituary, just published: The 66-year-old, who died from complications following surgery, was a consummate dealmaker, known for his nonstop work habit and razor sharp mind. A poker player, his entourage told of sleepless transatlantic flights where their chain-smoking boss always wanted to play \u2014 and win \u2014 another hand of cards. The same passion defined his improbable rescue of Fiat via an audacious merger with Chrysler that saved both companies and created the world\u2019s seventh largest car group. He persuaded General Motors to pay $2bn to escape its alliance with a near bankrupt Fiat in 2005 before swooping on a distressed Chrysler in 2009 and executing a full takeover of the group in 2014. The FT also points out that Marchionne enraged Italy\u2019s unions by slashing costs, and jobs, as he pushed to return Fiat to profitability: He was demonised by Beppe Grillo, founder of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement for his closure of plants and job cuts. At one political rally in Milan, Grillo led the crowd in a chant: \u201cF**k you, Marchionne\u201d. In private, Marchionne was acutely aware of the ravages that globalisation had on those left behind. Sergio Marchionne deserves great credit for his work rescuing Fiat since becoming its CEO 14 years ago, says Bloomberg: Marchionne was handed an automaker that lost more than \u20ac6bn ($7bn) in 2003. By 2005, he had returned the company to a profit by wringing some $2 billion from an alliance with General Motors Co., laying off thousands of workers, introducing new models, and slashing the time it took to get a new car to market to just 18 months, from four years. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration announced that Fiat would take control of Chrysler LLC, rescuing the American company from bankruptcy. \u201cI don\u2019t care what a tough guy he was to work for, he saved our company,\u201d said Cass Burch, a Chrysler and Jeep dealer in Georgia. \u201cHe deserves a bronze statue.\u201d Newsflash: Sergio Marchionne, one of the titans of the global car industry, has died. This very sad news comes just four days after Marchionne, aged 66, suddenly resigned from Fiat Chrysler, the company he had run for 14 years, last weekend. He reportedly suffered an embolism while undergoing shoulder surgery. FCA Chairman John Elkann said in a statement: \u201cUnfortunately, what we feared has come to pass. Sergio Marchionne, man and friend, is gone. During a highly successful career, Marchionne turned Fiat around - including a merger with America\u2019s Chrysler following the financial crisis. He was known as a passionate workaholic who turned two struggling carmakers into the world\u2019s seventh largest automaker, through relentless negotiating and cost-cutting. As Bernstein analyst Max Warburton put it earlier this year. \u201cSergio Marchionne\u2019s time as CEO of Fiat is already the stuff of legend.\u201d Evercore analyst George Galliers agreed that Marchionne was a real talent, saying: \u201cMarchionne is good at execution, strategy and gamesmanship.\u201d Britain\u2019s stock market has slipped into the red this morning, as investors await the Trump-Juncker meeting in Washington DC. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has dropped by over 40 points, or 0.55%, wiping out much of yesterday\u2019s rally. Mining stocks are among the top fallers, reflecting worries that global growth (and demand for commodities) will suffer from a trade war. Trade concerns are still prevalent in the markets, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, adding: In focus today will be the Trump/Juncker US-EU meeting in Washington, an attempt to resolve the recent trade confrontation. Trump is looking for concessions on EU exports to the US (especially cars). Juncker wants a full suspension of US tariffs before any deal can be agreed. Trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has tweeted that she had \u201cgood discussions\u201d with various US politicians. She met with Republican house senator Paul Ryan, and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, yesterday to press Europe\u2019s case, ahead of today\u2019s crunch meeting with the president. Former officials expect today\u2019s White House meeting between Trump and Juncker to be tense, says Politico. \u201cThe negotiating view of Donald Trump is unconditional surrender of the other side,\u201d said Ivo Daalder, who served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration. \u201cIf you\u2019re a betting person, it\u2019s not going to be a great meeting.\u201d Paul Donovan of investment bank UBS has a game to play at home: try completing the phrase \u201cTariffs are the greatest... He explains: Yesterday US President Trump tweeted \u201cTariffs are the greatest\u201d. The president may have been muddled, forgetting to finish the sentence. If implemented, tariffs are the greatest tax increase US consumers face this year. Tariffs are the greatest risk to US employment growth. Tariffs are the greatest threat to US and global economic growth. Trade war fears are already hurting German companies, according to a new survey just released. The IFO think tank reports that optimism among bosses fell this month, pulling down its \u2018expectations index\u2019 to 98.2 this month, from 98.6 in June. That suggests Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies are damaging Europe\u2019s largest economy. Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said. \u201cCompanies were slightly more satisfied with their current business situation, but scaled back their business expectations slightly. The German economy continues to expand, but at a slower pace.\u201d Expectations of car exports have fallen \u2018significantly\u2019, IFO adds. This pulled IFO\u2019s business climate index down to 101.7, from 101.8. However its current economic assessment rose to 105.3, from June\u2019s 105.1. German broadcaster ZDF reckons there are three ways the Trump-Juncker talks can play out. Scenario 1: The EU proposes renegotiating all tariffs with the EU, alongside reform of the World Trade Organisation. In return, president Trump would drop his threat to tax EU cars. That would lead to lengthy negotiations, and isn\u2019t the radical solution Trump would favour. Scenario 2: Juncker proposes a new plurilateral deal just on car sales, which would lower or even abolish all auto tariffs. However it would probably have to include other countries, such as Korea and Japan - complicating the chances of a quick deal. Scenario 3: No deal is reached, so Trump presses on with tariffs on EU car sales, and the EU retaliates. That would take the global economy closer to a full-blown trade war. We shouldn\u2019t expect a big breakthrough on trade today, says Simon French of City firm Panmure Gordon. He writes: Today represents an important test case for the breadth and sustainability of trade frictions as European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker meets with US president Trump. We do not expect a positive read-out and retain our base case that trade frictions will continue to expand all the way to the US mid-term elections in November. Newsflash: Europe is preparing to impose tariffs on $20bn of US imports, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has revealed. These tariffs would be brought in if Donald Trump follows through on his threat to hit European car imports with new tariffs, says Malmstrom, as she raises the heat ahead of today\u2019s meeting. Malmstrom told Swedish daily Dagens Nyheteron (via Reuters). \u201cWe hope that it doesn\u2019t come to that and that we can a solution. If not, the EU Commission is preparing a rather long list of many of American goods. It would be around $20 billion.\u201d It\u2019s not a very diplomatic approach to today\u2019s White House meeting. But perhaps it\u2019s a good way of getting Trump\u2019s attention... Maybe Malmstrom has been reading Trump\u2019s Art Of The Deal, which recommended taking a tough attitude in negotiations: The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you\u2019re dead.\u201d Shawn Donnan, the FT\u2019s world trade editor, isn\u2019t convinced by Trump\u2019s suggestion of abolishing all US-EU tariffs. He points out that some American farmers might be unhappy about a surge of imports from overseas, especially as China is now imposing new tariffs on US goods. Dutch MEP Marietje Schaake agrees that the idea is a stretch... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. They may need to lay out sponges and towels at the White House today, as Donald Trump hosts European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for trade talks. It could be a bruising meeting. Juncker and trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m hope to dial down the rising tensions in the global economy, and ward off the threat of a full-blown trade war. The talks will centre on the car industry, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on $50bn of EU car imports. That would hurt the German auto industry hard, and prompt retaliatory action from Brussels. Juncker could propose some concessions; there is talk that a \u201cplurilateral car deal\u201d could lower tariffs could address Trump\u2019s concerns. However, that would be politically tricky, for both sides -- America currently has a 25% levy on European trucks coming into the country, to protect jobs in its rust belt. Juncker has said his goal is to \u201cexplain and find out how to prevent a trade war\u201d. But the signs aren\u2019t great. Earlier this week, Trump tweeted that tariffs are \u201cgreat\u201d, and claimed America is being treated as a \u201cpiggy bank\u201d by countries who run a trade surplus with it. Overnight, the president has called for both sides to completely abolish tariffs, subsidies and other trade barriers. That would certainly shake globe trade up - but is hardly something that Juncker can sign off during a quick chat in the Oval Office. The stakes are high, though. Trump has already angered Europe by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium, which led to Europe putting 25% tariffs on bourbon whiskey, peanut butter, motorcycles and blue jeans. A rocky meeting could shake the financial markets, warns Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM: With escalating trade tensions between the European Union and the United States still a key theme that continues to weigh on global sentiment, the outcome of today\u2019s meeting could leave a lasting impact on the markets. If the talks prove unsuccessful and trade tensions end up escalating further, risk sentiment is likely to be negatively impacted. Market players should be prepared to expect the unexpected from the talks, especially when considering how highly unpredictable the Trump administration can be.

Mr Marchionne famously said there was no script for after his departure and the new CEO, Mike Manley, is having to start improvising more quickly than expected. The departure of the group\u2019s EMEA head, Alfredo Altavilla, on Monday will make his job that bit harder, as will the escalating global trade war. As a Chrysler insider and the head of Jeep, Mr Manley is unlikely to want to follow through on previous rumours that FCA would spin off Jeep, or even sell the whole company.</p> <p>Instead, he will probably continue to put Jeep at the centre of the group\u2019s global strategy, and cement the overall group\u2019s shift away from small cars towards sports utility vehicles. But if tariff barriers continue to rise, he will have to find a way to re-engineer the group\u2019s product line-up so that fewer vehicles and parts need to cross borders, without undermining the savings the group was getting from greater global integration.

Earlier this week, Trump tweeted that tariffs are \u201cgreat\u201d, and claimed America is being treated as a \u201cpiggy bank\u201d by countries who run a trade surplus with it.</p> <p>Overnight, the president has called for both sides to completely abolish tariffs, subsidies and other trade barriers. </p> <p>That would certainly shake globe trade up - but is hardly something that Juncker can sign off during a quick chat in the Oval Office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1021909900941815809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade.

      "bodyText": "It has been almost two decades since the first bosses of the newly merged GlaxoSmithKline talked up the medical wonders that would flow from the unravelling of the human genome. GSK would become the \u201cMicrosoft of the pharmaceutical industry\u201d, they said. To put it mildly, the corporate vision hasn\u2019t been realised. GSK\u2019s share price stood at \u00a320 at the time of the turn-of-the-century merger and is \u00a315.42 today. Lack of productivity in the labs has been a constant complaint. The genetics revolution is happening, but not at the pace originally promised, at least not at GSK. Here comes new-ish chief executive Emma Walmsley with the latest re-boot. GSK will invest $300m (\u00a3228m) in 23andMe, a gene profiling group backed by Google Ventures, and the pair will collaborate. The idea is that GSK will gain useful insights from the gene data of 5 million people held by 23andMe, and thus be better equipped to develop drugs that work by modulating immune systems. The new slogan is \u201cdriven by genetics\u201d. Walmsley says the deal could be \u201ctransformational in terms of the opportunity to identify disease-relevant genes and validated targets\u201d. That\u2019s a big promise and, given past disappointments, she would be better advised to tone down the hyperbole. But at least GSK has an interesting plan, as opposed to a loose ambition, to make its labs more productive. It certainly sounds a more promising approach than the fashionable City idea of splitting GSK into three companies. Pharma won\u2019t be fixed quickly, and it would understandable if investors from the merger days are bored of waiting for salvation. But that doesn\u2019t mean there are easy shortcuts. A break-up, to separate consumer products from pharmaceuticals and vaccines, would be an exercise in corporate gymnastics that wouldn\u2019t obviously create any value. Walmsley rejected (again) the breakup calls for the time being and was right to do so. Keep investing. Brexit: the City faces a gradual demise The government is planning how to secure food supplies to cope with a no-deal Brexit, but a consensus seems to have formed that the City won\u2019t go hungry whatever happens \u2013 at least not immediately. Between 3,500 and 12,000 jobs in financial services will be lost when the UK leaves the EU next March, Catherine McGuinness, chair of the City of London Corporation, said this week. Those figures roughly tally with the Bank of England\u2019s last estimate of 5,000 to 10,000. In the context of an industry that employs 400,000 people in London alone, the numbers aren\u2019t huge. Relax? Of course not. Wise City heads make two points. First, an instant exodus was never likely because it\u2019s hard to move thousands of jobs to new offices in Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin, or wherever. Highly paid employees in London tend to like the place and dig in. Instead, the greater danger is a long-term drift as EU policy-making in financial services moves out of London. Paris is the new home of the European Banking Authority and it\u2019s the prize the French financial establishment wanted most, reckons one senior UK banker. Paris has long suspected London used its dominance to write the rules to its advantage. Now it will try to reverse the process. The second point is that re-locations to the EU will not be the whole story. Wall Street will remain the biggest competitor to London, especially in financial activity that can be conducted anywhere on the planet. New York-based banks may decide they don\u2019t have to choose between the UK or the EU: they can just keep the jobs at home. Again, the process would be gradual \u2013 but it\u2019s probably the biggest threat to the City. Vodafone gets a shot at clearing the airwaves Vodafone has been transformed into a European telecoms titan under Vittorio Colao but the chief executive, who leaves in October, is not going out on a share-price high. At 175p, down from 235p a year ago, the shares now sport a dividend yield of an extraordinary 7.5%. Telecoms is currently an unloved sector and Vodafone has a few weak spots, notably Spain and Italy in the latest quarterly numbers. But a yield of 7.5% normally suggests the divi is at risk. City analysts don\u2019t think it is. If new boss Nick Read is similarly confident, he has the chance to clear the airwaves and get off to a flyer.",

    "webTitle": "Sergio Marchionne obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sergio Marchionne, who has died aged 66, having suffered complications after an operation, was renowned in the motor industry for the way he engineered dramatic turnarounds in the fortunes of Fiat and subsequently the Fiat Chrysler group. With the approval of the company\u2019s controlling Agnelli family, he became chief executive of Fiat in 2004, even though he was an accountant and tax specialist who had no previous experience of the car industry, taking the helm of a company that had lost $7bn the previous year. He took drastic measures to restore Fiat to financial health, including laying off thousands of employees, persuading General Motors to pay $2bn to sever its ties with Fiat, and slashing the time it took to bring new models to market. One of his most notable successes was overseeing the introduction of a new Fiat 500, an ingenious modern reworking of the original 1950s small car. During his tenure, he boosted Fiat\u2019s share value by more than 10 times. The financial analyst Massimo Vecchio, of the Italian investment bank Mediobanca, commented: \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of American in his management style. The only thing that matters to him is results. If you don\u2019t deliver, you are out.\u201d Nonetheless, although he was castigated by Beppe Grillo of Italy\u2019s Five Star political movement for cutting jobs and closing factories, Marchionne was not indifferent to the plight of workers. In 2009, Fiat struck a deal to take on the ailing Chrysler group, and Marchionne replaced Robert Nardelli as chief executive of Chrysler. In 2011, the new Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reported a profit for the first time in five years. However, in February that year, Marchionne sparked controversy when he commented that loans to Chrysler from the US and Canadian governments had been made at \u201cshyster rates\u201d, a comment deemed to carry antisemitic connotations. He apologised, while also pointing out that the interest rates, \u201calthough appropriate at the time, are above current market conditions\u201d. In September 2014, Marchionne became chairman of Ferrari, replacing the outgoing Luca di Montezemolo, and in 2015 instigated a plan to spin off Ferrari from FCA as an independent company, offering 10% of Ferrari\u2019s shares for sale to the public and the remaining 90% to existing FCA shareholders. Ferrari had been an independent company from its creation in 1947 until Fiat purchased a majority stake in 1969. Marchionne aimed to raise cash to fund a five-year investment plan with the objective of creating an organisation that could rival the Volkswagen group, but his attempt to merge with General Motors was rebuffed by the American company. Despite his array of existing commitments, Marchionne took a close interest in the Ferrari Formula One team, keen to recapture the glories of the Michael Schumacher era, and it was at his initiative that the team principal Marco Mattiacci was replaced by Maurizio Arrivabene. The subsequent signing of the multiple world champion Sebastian Vettel coincided with a steady increase in Ferrari\u2019s competitiveness, and Marchionne involved himself in strategy discussions about F1\u2019s future while cannily striking up an informal alliance with Mercedes. He was unhappy about new engine rules planned for 2021, and threatened that these could prompt Ferrari to quit the sport. Marchionne was born in Chieti in the Abruzzo region of Italy, the son of Maria (nee Zuccon) and Concezio Marchionne. Concezio met Maria while he was serving in the carabiniere in the Adriatic region of Istria, but moved to Chieti in 1945 when Yugoslav troops occupied Istria. When Sergio was 13, the family emigrated to Toronto, where they had relatives. He acquired dual Canadian and Italian citizenship and became fluent in English, French and Italian. After attending St Michael\u2019s College school, he earned a degree in philosophy from the University of Toronto in 1978, then a degree in commerce (1979) and an MBA (1985) from the University of Windsor. In 1983, he had added a law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School of York University, Toronto. He then worked as a tax specialist and chartered accountant for Deloitte &amp; Touche in Toronto. From 1985 until 1988, he was group controller and then director of corporate development for Lawson Mardon group, a packaging company. He moved through a succession of executive posts at companies including Glenex Industries, the accountants Acklands and the chemical and pharmaceutical company Alusuisse Lonza group. As chief executive of Alusuisse, he hived off its drug business into Lonza group, and in three years had tripled profits. In 2002 he was appointed chief executive of the Geneva-based SGS group, which was controlled by the Agnellis. They liked his style, and in 2003 he was appointed to the Fiat board of directors. Though he cut a somewhat nondescript figure in his unchanging uniform of jeans and a black pullover, Marchionne was a driven and energetic figure. He fuelled himself on strong espresso coffee and endless packs of Muratti cigarettes, whiled away the time on his numerous transatlantic flights with intense sessions of poker, and set a ferocious professional pace with which his employees and partners were expected to keep up. He liked to let off steam by driving his stable of Ferraris round the company\u2019s Maranello test track. \u201cWhen you\u2019re pissed off, there\u2019s nothing better than this,\u201d he said. He is survived by his partner, Manuela Battezzato, and by two children, Alessio and Tyler, from his marriage to Orlandina, from whom he had separated. \u2022 Sergio Marchionne, automobile executive, born 17 June 1952; died 25 July 2018",

He apologised, while also pointing out that the interest rates, \u201calthough appropriate at the time, are above current market conditions\u201d.</p> <p>In September 2014, Marchionne became chairman of Ferrari, replacing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/10/ferrari-president-luca-di-montezemolo-leave-criticism\" title=\"\">outgoing Luca di Montezemolo</a>, and in 2015 instigated a plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/29/ferrari-fiat-chrysler-luxury-brand\" title=\"\">spin off Ferrari from FCA</a> as an independent company, offering 10% of Ferrari\u2019s shares for sale to the public and the remaining 90% to existing FCA shareholders. Ferrari had been an independent company from its creation in 1947 until Fiat purchased a majority stake in 1969. Marchionne aimed to raise cash to fund a five-year investment plan with the objective of creating an organisation that could rival the Volkswagen group, but his attempt to merge with General Motors was rebuffed by the American company.</p> <p>Despite his array of existing commitments, Marchionne took a close interest in the Ferrari Formula One team, keen to recapture the glories of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-schumacher\" title=\"\">Michael Schumacher</a> era, and it was at his initiative that the team principal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/24/ferrari-marco-mattiacci-maurizio-arrivabene-f1\" title=\"\">Marco Mattiacci was replaced by Maurizio Arrivabene</a>. The subsequent signing of the multiple world champion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/20/sebastian-vettel-ferrari-fernando-alonso-f1\" title=\"\">Sebastian Vettel</a> coincided with a steady increase in Ferrari\u2019s competitiveness, and Marchionne involved himself in strategy discussions about F1\u2019s future while cannily striking up an informal alliance with Mercedes. He was unhappy about new engine rules planned for 2021, and threatened that these could prompt Ferrari to quit the sport.</p> <p>Marchionne was born in Chieti in the Abruzzo region of Italy, the son of Maria (nee Zuccon) and Concezio Marchionne. Concezio met Maria while he was serving in the carabiniere in the Adriatic region of Istria, but moved to Chieti in 1945 when Yugoslav troops occupied Istria. </p> <p>When Sergio was 13, the family emigrated to Toronto, where they had relatives. He acquired dual Canadian and Italian citizenship and became fluent in English, French and Italian. After attending St Michael\u2019s College school, he earned a degree in philosophy from the University of Toronto in 1978, then a degree in commerce (1979) and an MBA (1985) from the University of Windsor. In 1983, he had added a law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School of York University, Toronto.</p> <p>He then worked as a tax specialist and chartered accountant for Deloitte &amp; Touche in Toronto. From 1985 until 1988, he was group controller and then director of corporate development for Lawson Mardon group, a packaging company.</p> <p>He moved through a succession of executive posts at companies including Glenex Industries, the accountants Acklands and the chemical and pharmaceutical company Alusuisse Lonza group. As chief executive of Alusuisse, he hived off its drug business into Lonza group, and in three years had tripled profits. In 2002 he was appointed chief executive of the Geneva-based SGS group, which was controlled by the Agnellis. They liked his style, and in 2003 he was appointed to the Fiat board of directors.</p> <p>Though he cut a somewhat nondescript figure in his unchanging uniform of jeans and a black pullover, Marchionne was a driven and energetic figure. He fuelled himself on strong espresso coffee and endless packs of Muratti cigarettes, whiled away the time on his numerous transatlantic flights with intense sessions of poker, and set a ferocious professional pace with which his employees and partners were expected to keep up. He liked to let off steam by driving his stable of Ferraris round the company\u2019s Maranello test track. \u201cWhen you\u2019re pissed off, there\u2019s nothing better than this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He is survived by his partner, Manuela Battezzato, and by two children, Alessio and Tyler, from his marriage to Orlandina, from whom he had separated.</p> <p>\u2022 Sergio Marchionne, automobile executive, born 17 June 1952; died 25 July 2018</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sergio Marchionne, the former Fiat Chrysler chief executive who merged and revived the Italian and US carmakers, has died aged 66. Marchionne, who fell ill with complications from shoulder surgery, was replaced as boss of the manufacturer last weekend as his condition deteriorated. The company\u2019s chairman, John Elkann, part of the Agnelli family who own Fiat, said in a statement on Wednesday: \u201cUnfortunately, what we feared has come to pass. Sergio Marchionne, man and friend, is gone.\u201d Marchionne joined Fiat in 2004 and forged a reputation for swift, tough action, cutting layers of management and overseeing a return to profit and further global expansion. In 2009, Fiat took its first stake in the bankrupt US firm Chrysler, eventually completing a takeover and merger in 2014 that would create the world\u2019s seventh-biggest car manufacturer. News of his death will compound a sense of uncertainty at Fiat, although investors were primed for the charismatic chief executive\u2019s departure, planned for 2019. After the announcement in June shares fell 10%. Marchionne had sought further mergers to help his company tackle the cost of developing a new generation of electric and autonomous vehicles, but his attempts to woo General Motors were rebuffed. Marchionne had been due to remain at the helm of FCA-owned Ferrari, now spun off as a separate division, and Ferrari shares have slipped 7% since it was confirmed he was stepping down. A new chief executive, Mike Manley, who headed Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Jeep division, was installed on Saturday as the firm announced Marchionne would be unable to return to work following his surgery, carried out three weeks ago in Switzerland. The challenge for Manley began immediately when the head of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s business in Europe, Middle East and Africa resigned after being passed over for the top job. The firm has seen its market share slip in Europe since 2009 and has put its faith in producing more SUVs, as well as electric and hybrid cars, with a target of doubling profits by 2022. The Jeep brand, which has had strong sales under Manley\u2019s watch, remains one of its stronger hopes. However, Fiat Chrysler are left now without one of the car industry\u2019s more distinctive figures\u2013 a man known for colourful turns of phrase, tough deal-making and his signature dark cashmere sweaters. Marchionne was credited with financial coups in persuading GM to pay $2bn to sever its ties with Fiat, and the US government to hand over its share in Chrysler in exchange for Fiat\u2019s technology. Marchionne joined Fiat after working in accountancy and biotechnology firms, headhunted as an outsider by the Agnelli family to shake up its family-run enterprise. He returned the loss-making company to profit within two years, partly by speeding up production times and laying off thousands of workers, earning him the long-term hostility of many in Italy, from unions to the populist Five Star movement. Carlo Alberto De Casa, an analyst at ActivTrades, said Marchionne deserved credit for turning an \u201calmost bankrupt\u201d Fiat into an international powerhouse. \u201cHis heritage could be described in just a few numbers: in 2004, when Marchionne took over, Fiat\u2019s revenue was close to \u20ac47bn, today it exceeds \u20ac140bn. The company\u2019s profit almost trebled in the same period. \u201cLoved or hated, Marchionne is the man who made FCA as we know it today: more successful and a little less Italian.\u201d Although Marchionne was seen as a tough boss \u2013 and quickly sacked a rank of Chrysler executives on assuming control in the US \u2013 analysts said he should be considered the man who saved the ailing Detroit firm. Autotrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs said: \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely that Chrysler would exist today had he not taken that gamble. The company was in such bad shape, being stripped of any kind of resources by the previous owners.\u201d Trading in Fiat Chrysler was temporarily suspended in Milan on Wednesday after shares fell 4.5%. It came after the firm reported a disappointing operating profit for the second quarter, and revised down parts of its full-year outlook.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The huge popularity of Love Island and England\u2019s World Cup campaign drove a 22% surge in ITV\u2019s advertising revenues in June and a further 9% rise in July. Carolyn McCall, ITV\u2019s chief executive, lauded the \u201cfantastic\u201d viewing figures for the tournament and reality show for helping the broadcaster achieve a strong performance in the first half of the year. \u201c[Our] share of viewing [against competitors] was up 9% in the period, with outstanding contributions from Love Island and the World Cup,\u201d McCall said. The company said the rate of growth was the biggest in ITV\u2019s recent history and the broadcaster\u2019s share of viewers was at a 10-year high. ITV\u2019s exclusive coverage of England\u2019s semi-final against Croatia peaked at 26.6 million viewers, and the average of 24.3 million viewers for the match was bigger than the audiences for the London 2012 Olympics opening and closing ceremonies. ITV said Love Island, which airs on ITV2, has achieved the second-highest audience on a digital channel. ITV has sold the Love Island format to seven countries, with an eighth major market to be announced soon. The Love Island mobile phone game, which is free to download before players pay for virtual items such as bikinis, is the top-grossing title on Apple\u2019s charts, ahead of Fortnite and Candy Crush. McCall, who joined ITV from easyJet at the start of the year, also used the broadcaster\u2019s half-year results to unveil a strategy \u201crefresh\u201d. She said ITV would invest \u00a340m across the business next year, and a total of \u00a360m over the next three years, with a focus on being \u201cmore than TV\u201d, including a lesser reliance on TV advertising and a greater focus on its TV production business. The company is also planning a direct-to-consumer business featuring competitions, live events and voting. The company said the investment will be partly paid for by up to \u00a340m of cost savings achieved \u201cwithout impacting the culture and creative and commercial strength of the business\u201d. McCall would not rule out job cuts, saying there needed to be a \u201crealignment\u201d of skills in the business, but said \u201cthe net impact will probably be positive on people [numbers] over the three years\u201d. \u201cThis is very much a refresh, not a reboot, as ITV is a strong business, no longer solely reliant on UK advertising,\u201d she said. McCall said a significant amount of the \u00a360m investment would go into developing its streaming service, ITV Hub. ITV has also held talks with rivals including the BBC about a potential joint streaming service. \u201cWe are talking to a range of potential partners,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have done a lot of analysis and there is real demand for distinctive British content. There is a bit of a gap and a window and there is a strategic intention to do something more in that area.\u201d ITV Hub+, which costs \u00a33.99 for an ad-free experience and access outside the UK, has seen subscriber numbers grow 500% year on year to 286,000. Despite the advertising boost, the broadcaster is forecasting declines once the current series of Love Island finishes at the end of next week. ITV expects advertising revenues in August to be down by 7% and to fall by as much as 5% in September. By the end of September, ITV expects its ad revenues for the year to be up 1% on 2017. Revenue rose 8% to \u00a31.6bn in the first six months of the year, while pre-tax profit increased by 2.3% to \u00a3265m.",
