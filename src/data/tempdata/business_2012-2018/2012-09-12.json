      "bodyText": "To Whom It May Concern: I saw your advertisement for the job of \"Governor of the Bank of England\" in the Economist (I was at the dentist; someone else got to Grazia first), and am writing to apply for the post. I understand the job requires \"good economic knowledge\", and although I cannot pretend to be an expert on European bail out structures or the Libor scandal, I do grasp what's happening in the financial markets right now: essentially, money is dying. I also know you have had a few people rule themselves out for the position already, so I figure I'm in with a shot. As for solutions to the present crisis, I am, like the current governor, very big on quantitative easing (QE, I call it). Believe me, there have been many times in my life when the ability to simply print more money would have solved everything, and I'm looking forward to getting stuck in. I see your requirements call for someone with good interpersonal skills. I take it that by this you mean \"someone with better interpersonal skills than Sir Mervyn King\", in which case, I'm definitely qualified. I totally get how important people skills are for maintaining market confidence. You want someone who will answer the phone by saying: \"Hello, I'm the governor of the Bank of England. How may I help you today?\" It's so much more inspiring than a recording that says: \"If you need us to print more money, press 2.\" I hope you will consider me, as I am confident I have what it takes to lead the Bank of England, chair the Monetary Policy Committee and safeguard the stability of the UK financial system.

I understand the job requires \"good economic knowledge\", and although I cannot pretend to be an expert on&#xa0;European bail out structures or the Libor scandal, I do grasp what's happening in the financial markets right now: essentially, money is dying. I also know you have had a few people rule themselves out for the position already, so I figure I'm in with a shot.</p> <p>As for solutions to the present crisis, I am, like the current governor, very big on quantitative easing (QE, I call it). Believe me, there have been many times in my life when the ability to simply print more money would have solved everything, and I'm looking forward to getting stuck in.</p> <p>I see your requirements call for someone with good interpersonal skills. I take it that by this you mean \"someone with better interpersonal skills than Sir Mervyn King\", in which case, I'm definitely qualified. I totally get how important people skills are for maintaining market confidence. You want someone who will answer the phone by saying: \"Hello, I'm the governor of the Bank of England. How may I help you today?\" It's so much more inspiring than a recording that says: \"If you need us to print more money, press 2.\"</p> <p>I hope you will consider me, as&#xa0;I am confident I have what it takes to lead the Bank of England, chair the Monetary Policy Committee and safeguard the stability of the UK financial system. In the meantime, I have a few questions about the position:</p> <p>\u2022 Your ad says the successful candidate will \"work closely with the chancellor of the exchequer\". Is this non-negotiable?

The German constitutional court has delivered its verdict: it's a \"yes\" to the legality of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), albeit with the heavy rider that the Bundestag can veto any increase in Germany's contribution to the rescue fund above \u20ac190bn (\u00a3152bn). Is it off to the races then? Is \u20ac500bn of potential lending from the ESM, plus Mario Draghi and European Central Bank piling in with unlimited bond purchases, now a safeguard of stability? Can we stop worrying about whether the single currency will be around in recognisable form in a half a decade or so? No. Already the potential flaw in Draghi's carrot-and-stick approach is obvious. It is not clear what would happen if Spain, say, requests financial help but then fails to deliver on the terms of the accompanying reform package demanded by the EU, the European commission and the International Monetary Fund. Would Draghi turn off the bond-buying tap? That's what he has implied would happen. But it very hard to believe that the central bank, having gone this far, would abandon Spain at a moment of crisis. The ECB would be giving up on the euro in its current form, and incurring some heavy losses of its freshly bought bonds. Instead, it seems more likely that efforts would be made to downgrade the stick (the reform package) to a softer implement. But try selling that idea to sceptical German voters - or, indeed, to the Bundesbank, already fretting that the ECB has got itself into the business of funding member states. Of course, this scenario is yet to occur and will not happen overnight. That is why almost everybody agrees that Draghi has succeeded in buying a considerable amount of time. The trouble is, the potential flaw looks highly likely to be tested sooner or later if Spain is indeed forced to take austerity measures. Youth unemployment is 50%, the banking system is on life support and the economy is in recession. Cutting the short-term cost of government funding would clearly help. But cheaper money alone does not create demand or stir recovery.

      "bodyText": "Germany's political elite is relieved. The Karlsruhe court ruling on the constitutionality of the euro bailout fund unties chancellor Angela Merkel's hands in the longrunning effort to save the single currency. But it also highlights the curbs on any German government's freedom to make policy, particularly on arguably the most pressing issue in Merkel's in-tray \u2014 what to do about Europe? Merkel's mantra in recent weeks is that she wants \"more Europe\". Her Christian Democratic party has passed a motion calling for greater European integration. On Wednesday in his state of the union speech to the European parliament, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European commission, lined up behind Merkel for the first time with a radical rallying call. \"Let's not be afraid of the words. We will need to move towards a federation of nation states. This is what we need. This is our political horizon,\" he declared. A new European federation with common fiscal, economic, and budget policies stripping national parliaments and governments of the most fundamental powers, a directly elected president of Europe with the main European political party groupings putting up candidates at the next European parliament elections in 2014 for Barroso's job \u2014 head of the European executive. All of this effectively requires a new European constitution or at the very least a renegotiation of the Lisbon treaty, triggering referendums in some countries, including Britain and in all likelihood a UK exit from the EU. It's not a new, but a nonetheless radical federalist blueprint re-energised by the EU's worst ever crisis, the euro meltdown. Much of this vision is not only shared but originates in Berlin. But it would never get past the eight judges in Karlsruhe. Is Merkel serious about her European \"political union\"? \"It might be a distraction from the immediate crisis, but yes, they're serious,\" said Katinka Barysch, a German economist at the Centre for European Reform. \"You can still convince most Germans that more Europe is a good thing. And they're doing this out of political necessity, to show the public they're not panicking blindly because of market pressure.\" The problem for the politicians is the constitutional court. \"The Grundgesetz [basic law] is a constraint,\" added Barysch. The proposals from Barroso on Wednesday and the kind of EU quantum leap being mulled in Berlin require vast transfers of sovereignty to EU institutions from national parliaments and governments. Karlsruhe already set firm limits on this in its verdict on the Lisbon treaty a couple of years ago. Andreas Vosskuhle, the judge who read out Wednesday's verdict, has said previously that the scope for further European integration is already exhausted under the terms of Germany's constitution. In short, Germany as well as the EU needs a new constitution for the Merkel-Barroso vision to be more than a mirage. And that means a referendum. National referendums are banned in Germany because of the plebiscitary abuse performed during the Third Reich. The sole grounds for a referendum is to change the constitution. This is already shaping up to be a major issue on the assumption that Merkel wins a third term a year from now. If, as often predicted, she forms a \"grand coalition\" with the opposition social democrats, the two big pro-EU parties will have a thumping majority to push constitutional change. \"Everything will depend on what coalition she forms next year,\" said Ulrike Guerot of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. \"The pressure on the constitution has become so high that you cannot make the big game-shift.\" All of this is treacherous political territory where Merkel has to perform two formidable and parallel tasks \u2014 persuade German public opinion, fed up with the euro crisis and revering the big independent institutions, the court in Karlsruhe and the Bundesbank in Frankfurt, that the Basic Law needs to be changed, while also coaxing the rest of the leaders of Europe into backing what Barroso is describing as a \"new deal.\" No French president has ever assented to the federalist plot. Will Fran\u00e7ois Hollande be any different? While supporting German hawkishness on the euro crisis, the Dutch don't want to transfer any more powers to Brussels. Another Irish referendum could wreck the gameplan. No British government would take part. At which point the Germans and Barroso will lower their sights and settle for a eurozone rather than a full EU federation. Berlin will tell Paris and everyone else that if they want to use German credit cards to guarantee or redeem their debt, the federation is the price they will have to pay. Much of the eurozone is keen on pooling liability, but not on giving up sovereignty, Merkel is fond of complaining. Hollande, if he is unable to turn around a weakening French economy, will face very tough choices. \"The really big German concern is about France,\" said Guerot. \"That's the big debate, but it's a Venus-Mars discussion. Will France make the compromise needed for political union to get German money? Either the French jump or we all don't jump at all.\"",

      "bodyText": "When the real world fails to live up to their neat mathematical models, economists throw up their hands and say they've come a cross a \"puzzle\". One such source of confusion is the continued health of the UK's labour market, in the face of the weakest recovery in living memory. The puzzle is still present in Wednesday's labour market statistics, which show that employment has continued to rise much faster than the growth-rate of the economy would suggest. Wonks call it the \"productivity puzzle\": if GDP is shrinking, why have firms continued to create jobs, albeit many of them part-time? Or putting it the other way around, if there are so many more people employed in our offices, shops and factories, why aren't they producing more stuff? One solution to this particular puzzle, popular among City economists who have got their predictions wrong, is to doubt the data: the Office for National Statistics has repeatedly been accused of getting its sums wrong, and overestimating the weakness of the economy. The data may be revised over time; but it is unlikely to be a significant enough turnaround to explain the 236,000 increase in employment in the three months to July. But the alternative explanation is grim: one result of the jarring double-dip recession Britain has endured since 2007 may have been to blow a hole in the productivity of its workforce. It may be because of the debt hangover from the boom years, crimping banks' desire to lend and firms' ability to borrow; or perhaps some of the productivity improvements seen in the run-up to the crisis were illusory, based on the excess profitability of the finance industry, not genuine technological improvements (how on earth do you accurately measure the output of a hedge fund manager?). But if that's the solution to the \"productivity puzzle\", it has serious implications for public policy. If the long-term growth rate of the economy is lower than the Office for Budget Responsibility suspects, because our productivity has weakened sharply, it will have to revise down its predictions for growth, and tax revenues and sharply increase its expectations of the deficit, leaving George Osborne with fiscal sums that no longer add up. And as labour market economist Paul Gregg suggested at last week's Policy Network conference at the London Stock Exchange, if productivity has been permanently impaired, the economy will have to employ many more people to produce the same rate of GDP growth \u2013 and improvement in living standards \u2013 we have all come to expect. Gregg believes that will have to mean active labour market policies, keeping older workers inside firms and making use of their skills, instead of pitching them into retirement at 60 or 65 for example, and ensuring that young people's talents are not wasted. The coalition, with its kneejerk laissez-faire approach, is unlikely to share his prescription.

Employment is up, unemployment and the claimant count are down, and the rate of inactivity is at its lowest since 1991. These figures will no doubt raise more questions about the accuracy of the latest GDP figures, which show three consecutive quarters of negative growth.</p> <p>Despite this positive news, there are still some areas of concern. The number of people forced to work part-time because they cannot find a full-time job has reached a new high, and there are still too many young people unemployed. More deficit cuts in the coming months mean there will be a further reduction in public sector employment, although it is reassuring to see that the private sector is willing and able to create new jobs.</p> <p>Overall, it is clear that growth is still too weak, and problems in the eurozone will continue to put pressure on our exporters. The government must build on the positive job figures by implementing more policies that allow businesses to deliver growth. An effective growth strategy should include further deregulation, increased infrastructure spending and the creation of a British Business Bank.</p> <h2>Jens Larsen, chief European economist, RBC Capital Markets</h2> <p>Unemployment is steady, the employment rate is picking up and the inactivity rate is falling. Given the weak output performance, the result is continued weak productivity performance. Our best explanation is that the underlying drivers of weak demand and weak productivity are the same: if the financial sector is constraining consumption and investment demand, and also holds back the necessary re-allocation of resources, then both demand and productivity will suffer. Of course, it might be possible that GDP will be revised up, or even surprise on the upside. Wage growth continues to be restrained\u2014whether that reflects spare capacity in the labour market or weak productivity growth remains the key question.</p> <h2>John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist</h2> <p>Today's figures confirm that the UK continues to enjoy a jobs boom even though the economy is struggling to emerge from the double dip recession. An additional 236,000 jobs in a single quarter, more than 100,000 full-time, is a remarkable achievement at any time but in current economic conditions is near miraculous.</p> <p>Even more remarkable is the fact that the economy is adding so many jobs against a backdrop of a near static level of job vacancies. Indeed, the number of unemployed people per vacancy is slightly higher than in mid-2010. In other words, the labour market is proving really effective at filling whatever vacancies do arise even though, as a result of weak macroeconomic conditions, the economy isn't creating net extra vacancies. This probably in part reflects pressure on welfare claimants to seek work more actively and partly to the fact that jobseekers in general are more prepared than in previous decades to take whatever work is on offer, no matter what pay or hours are involved. Either way this amounts to a structural shift in the operation of the labour market. Consequently, the labour market is at least to some extent decoupled from the macro economy, albeit prolonged weak output growth may eventually have a negative impact on jobs and unemployment if it results in far fewer net vacancies to fill or increased redundancies.</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit</h2> <p>The UK economy appears to be in rude health, creating a near-record increase in jobs over the summer, led by the private sector taking on staff in increasing numbers. The data are in line with the message from the business surveys that the economy is by no means in another downturn, as indicated by official economic growth data, but enjoyed a strong expansion so far this year. However, recent downturns in the surveys suggest that the startling job creation seen so far this year is set to wane unless demand picks up further. In that respect, we see some encouragement from recent developments to alleviate the eurozone crisis, which may well bring about a swift upturn in business confidence and remove one of the biggest causes of weak global economic growth in recent months.</p> <p>Data from the Office for National Statistics showed employment rising by an impressive 236,000 in the three months to July, the third-largest increase ever seen and taking employment up to 29.56 million, its highest since May 2008. Since comparable data were first available in 1971, the latest increase has only been exceeded by the 276,000 rise seen in the three months to July 2010 and the 239,000 increase seen in the three months to August 1987.</p> <p>It was not all good news though, with the unemployment rate \u2013 as measured by the labour force survey \u2013 rising to 8.1%. Unemployment now stands at 2.59 million, but perhaps more worryingly the number of people that have been unemployed for more than one year rose to 904,000, its highest since May 2006.</p> <h2>Ian Brinkley, director of The Work Foundation</h2> <p>The overall figures are remarkably good. This is the third quarter that total employment has increased despite the economy apparently being in recession \u2013 still not enough to confirm a trend, but definitely not a blip. The private sector has continued to hire in large numbers, although the overall performance may also have been boosted by a temporary slowdown in public sector job losses in the three months to June.</p> <p>What is striking is how little impact this has had on unemployment \u2013 despite the large numbers of jobs created, unemployment has fallen by just 7,000. Large numbers of students, retirees and people on long-term sick leave seem to be returning to the jobs market, putting extra pressure on it. The rapid growth of the working age population is also having an effect. This development shows just how much of the pain in the labour market has been hidden in the past. There is still a long way to go before unemployment returns to normal levels. Digging beneath the totals, the figures show some weaknesses. The majority of the new jobs were either part-time or self-employed. While any increase in employment is encouraging, a full labour market recovery must offer more full-time employee jobs. The number of people in part-time jobs who said they wanted a full-time job did not increase significantly, but is still at a record high.</p> <h2>David Tinsley, economist at BNP Paribas</h2> <p>There's no doubt the UK labour market is providing a good deal of solace to those fed up with hearing about the recession. The big puzzle in the data remains however how an economy that still has a level of GDP that is 4.5% below the level seen in 2008 Q1, just before the UK entered recession, can have a level of employment that is now 0.2% higher over that period. This implies a puzzlingly large loss of labour productivity in the economy. Many of the candidate explanations, such as significant labour hoarding, the impact of sectoral rebalancing or the possibility that GDP or employment is being mismeasured, appear to provide only partial explanations.</p> <p>For policy of course this is fiendishly difficult. The MPC can't realistically be confident about where domestically generated inflationary pressures will be in year or two's time if the level of employment could quite plausibly be lower or higher than today. Only time will tell and with the benefit of hindsight no doubt the committee will be judged as having got it 'wrong' one way or another. But one has to have some sympathy with policymakers having to play the rather confusing hand they are being dealt currently.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir David Walker, the incoming chairman of Barclays, has reignited the debate over disclosure of top pay by calling for banks and other major companies to publish numbers on all staff earning more than \u00a31m. At the first hearing of the new parliamentary commission on banking standards, Walker also said that bonuses should not be linked to sales targets as he admitted that standards in the banking industry \"had slipped in a grave way\". Walker was appearing before MPs and peers on the new commission, chaired by the Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, for his 2009 review of corporate governance in banks for Labour rather than in his capacity as chairman of Barclays, a role he begins at the start of November once Marcus Agius departs following the Libor-rigging scandal. In 2009, Walker called for pay above \u00a31m to be disclosed in bands, without individuals being identified \u2013 though he backed down when the coalition came to power. But he told the committee that consideration should now be given to requiring bands of the top \"50 to 100\" highest paid bankers to be released, in what appeared to be a return to his 2009 recommendation. \"It is very hard for one firm to do that isolation,\" he said, calling for a \"public policy response\". \"My recommendation would be hard to confine to banks.\" With major companies arguing they need to pay staff to compete internationally, he said that \"being secretive\" would not help win the argument. But he made clear that he was not opposed to high pay and that the EU's attempt to cap total pay would only lead to higher salaries. \"The inappropriate incentivisation is accountable for a lot of what has gone wrong. The problem that has been most serious is not so much levels of remuneration but the gearing of remuneration to revenue,\" said Walker. \"The preoccupation with short-term revenues in the investment banks has been hugely damaging.\" Instead of adopting the Walker proposals, the coalition required the top five highest paid executives outside the boardroom to be published, anonymously. In the first year of new rule, for the 2010 financial year, Barclays disclosures showed that five of its top bankers had been handed \u00a3110m. The five included Rich Ricci, the current head of the investment bank, and Jerry del Missier, who left following the Libor scandal. They both earned more than chief executive Bob Diamond, who has now left following the \u00a3290m fine for Libor rigging. Disclosure of the top eight outside the boardroom is now required, though the individuals do not need to be identified. Following the \"shareholder spring\" and the recent consultation by business secretary Vince Cable on boardroom pay, Walker added: \"All FTSE 100 remuneration committees are on notice they are under the spotlight.\" Walker has previously raised concerns about free in-credit banking for current account customers \u2013 believing that it could encourage misselling of more profitable products \u2013 and admitted on Wednesday that no bank would want to be the first mover in introducing changes. He put the emphasis on a body such as the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the matter. He said that the industry needed to \"get away from remuneration tied to revenue performance or sales\" following misselling scandals such as payment protection insurance for which the major banks are facing a bill of more than \u00a38bn. But, a former regulator and banker, also made clear that he did not think that harking back to the past was the right thing to do, citing \"clear malpractice\" in the early 1980s before new rules were introduced. As well as the focus on commissions, he regarded the new emphasis on quarterly reporting by major companies as detrimental. He said that during the \"go-go\" years chasing market share through sales targets was easy to achieve. \"All you have to do is forget to price risk into the charges you apply,\" said Walker. He said that speed was also regarded as more important \"rather than old fashioned concerns about integrity\".",

Barbecue sales dropped 8% on last year, hosepipes and greenhouses were both down 25% and plant sales fell 20%. However, as \"staying in was the new going out\", sales of decorative paint climbed 15% and spot heating sales soared 96%. B&amp;Q also sold 13% more lawnmowers as grass sprouted rapidly, 60% more water butts and 33% more slug pellets. Kingfisher is looking at sourcing more seasonal products closer to the time, rather than a year in advance, as well as shifting unsold stock to other parts of the group where the weather is better. In addition, \"the company has a number of self-help initiatives from growth in direct sourcing over the next three years, the development of common ranges to all stores and the further expansion of own label, which will all collectively help support earnings,\" said Seymour Pierce analyst Freddie George. \"However, the company's two core markets, UK and France, are mature, and in both these markets the company has too much space, which will require major restructuring, particularly in the UK.\" Cheshire said the problem was getting out of eight-year leases in the UK, while in France the leases are much shorter. \"We are looking very carefully at every foot of space and could sublet or exit some,\" he said. Kingfisher is not opening any more B&amp;Q stores, apart from 29 Focus DIY shops it picked up from the administrators that have been converted into B&amp;Qs and are all open now, bar one. Leases for new Screwfix stores are shorter, averaging five years.",
