      "bodyText": "In Dr Seuss it was the Grinch who stole Christmas, but as the dust settles on a hard-fought trading period for Britain\u2019s retailers a new, more dangerous culprit has emerged: Black Friday. The US discount day at the end of November caused havoc for store groups more used to watching sales build steadily as Christmas approaches. John Lewis, selling everything from iPads to toy penguins, emerged as the clear winner, while Marks &amp; Spencer took the wooden spoon after the computers at its hi-tech distribution centre at Castle Donington said no. Newly listed video games specialist Game crashed and burned, issuing a massive profit warning after it lost a games console price war. In the grocery aisles there was little joy for the major chains as discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to eat their breakfast, lunch and Christmas dinner. The sales declines recorded by Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s were not as bad as some had feared, leaving Morrisons to be crowned the biggest turkey after a weak sales performance that sealed the fate of its chief executive, Dalton Philips. Winners John Lewis The heartwarming tale of Monty the penguin helped John Lewis march to Christmas victory with like-for-like sales up 4.8% in the five weeks to 27 December. Black Friday mania gave the chain its best ever week of sales in its 150-year history, when it shifted \u00a3179m of goods in seven days. With Black Friday deals focused on low margin electricals, a late run on fashion and beauty helped shore up profits and its logistics did not let it down. Next The December cold snap and strong sales at the home shopping arm Directory helped Next recover some of the ground lost earlier in the season when mild weather sapped demand for winter woollens. Sales rose 2.9% in the two months to Christmas Eve, which was at the top end of expectations. With shareholders in line for another special dividend, chief executive Simon Wolfson\u2019s refusal to launch a pre-Christmas sale appeared vindicated. House of Fraser Black Friday kicked off a strong Christmas for House of Fraser, with like-for-like sales at the privately-owned department store up 8% over the six weeks to 3 January. Margins were boosted by sales of own label brands Linea and Biba. Greggs In what is probably better news for investors than the country\u2019s collective waistline, the Newcastle baker delivered one of the best retail performances of Christmas 2014, with like-for-like sales up more than 8% in December. As Shore Capital analyst Clive Black put it: \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing that in the age of social media and Black Friday, the humble sausage roll is Britain\u2019s winner.\u201d SuperGroup \u201cThe curse of Euan Sutherland\u201d proved overdone as the man who walked out of the Co-op last year bounced back from its October profit warning to report stonking like-for-like sales growth of 12.4% over the 11 weeks to 10 January. The belated cold weather stoked demand for Superdry knits and bomber jackets, delivering a late Christmas present for the fashion chain. JD Sports The decision to dump loss-making fashion chain Bank at the end of last year helped JD Sports romp away with like-for-like sales growth of 12% for the five weeks to 3 January as trainers and hoodies proved popular gifts. It now expects full-year profits to better even the most optimistic market forecasts of \u00a390m. HMV The music specialist is making a comeback in private hands with the festive surge in demand for CDs and vinyl seeing it overtake Amazon as the UK\u2019s No 1 seller of physical music over the Christmas period. The retailer said like-for-like CD sales were up 1.5% and DVD and Blu-ray ahead 0.5% during 2014. Losers Game There were blushes all round at Game on Tuesday when it rushed out a major profit warning after the stock market closed. The retailer only refloated in the summer \u2013 having crashed into administration in 2012 \u2013 and was thought to be enjoying a purple patch as the latest generation of consoles fired up gamers\u2019 imaginations. Instead chief executive, Martyn Gibbs, said annual profits would now come in at around \u00a351m rather than the \u00a364m expected. The number of consoles sold was up more than 25% over the Christmas and New Year period, but sales crashed 5.4% as console and games bundles were sold at knockdown prices after Black Friday. Its shares closed the week down nearly 30%. Ouch. Morrisons In the words of Wham! 2014 turned out to be boss Dalton Philips\u2019s last Christmas at Morrisons. The affable Irishman had thrown everything his Harvard MBA taught him at trying to turn round the country\u2019s fourth largest supermarket, but failed. Incoming chairman Andrew Higginson said enough was enough and it was time for a \u201cfresh pair of eyes\u201d. Philips first attempted to take Morrisons stores upmarket, then switched to cutting prices to win back shoppers. But by Christmas investors had run out of patience. Sales fell 3.1% in the six weeks to 4 January \u2013 compared with falls of 0.3% and 1.7% at Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s respectively. Coming third meant curtains for Philips and he leaves in March (with a pay-off of around \u00a31m). Boohoo There were tears for Boohoo investors as it warned profits would be more than 25% below City expectations after heavy discounting meant extra spending on marketing failed to boost sales. Its shares crashed 40% on the day and are now languishing at around 25p, half their March float price. Thorntons While rival confectioner Cadbury\u2019s has meddled with its Creme Eggs, Thorntons always seems to be tinkering with its business model in a bid to find long-term success. Optimism in the latest turnaround plan melted away after a pre-Christmas profit warning blamed on fewer orders from supermarket customers and warehouse problems. Marks &amp; Spencer Even the Christmas fairies Magic and Sparkle that M&amp;S roped into its Christmas ads couldn\u2019t reverse a four-year-long slump in clothing sales. The retailer disappointed yet again with a near 6% decline in underlying clothing and homewares sales in the three months to 27 December. Online sales were down almost 6% as a new hi-tech distributions centre failed to deliver on time many of the orders placed over the Black Friday weekend. Majestic Wine For Majestic Wine boss Steve Lewis Christmas 2014 left a sour taste as it was squeezed by warring supermarkets. Underlying sales were up just over 1% while profit margins suffered as it was forced to cut prices to compete.",

      "bodyText": "Austin Reed Group is set to close 31 stores and receive a \u00a33m cash injection from shareholders under a deal with creditors to rescue the tailoring brand, which counts IMF chief Christine Lagarde among its customers. The 114-year-old, privately owned company, which also owns Viyella and CC (previously Country Casuals), is hoping to strike a deal with landlords in which they would accept a fifth less rent on 35 stores and 50% less on a further 31, which however are then likely to close after six months. Under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a controversial type of restructuring scheme, a further 166 stores would continue to trade as normal, including Austin Reed\u2019s flagship store on Regent Street in London. Creditors, mainly landlords, are due to vote on whether to accept the company\u2019s proposals on 5 February. Nick Hollingworth, chief executive of Austin Reed Group, said: \u201cThe decision to close some stores was not taken lightly, but we cannot continue to operate those within our portfolio that are loss-making.\u201d Neville Kahn and Rob Harding of Deloitte, the accountancy firm, have been appointed to oversee the CVA, which comes after Austin Reed fell into pretax losses of \u00a31.29m in the year to January 2014, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Kahn said: \u201cThe proposals to landlords are a necessary step to provide a sustainable platform for the business. As with a number of retailers in the current market, the group has a traditional bricks-and-mortar portfolio in an increasingly multi-channel environment.\u201d CVAs, which have been used by Fitness First, Clinton Cards and JJB Sports in recent years, are controversial because, unlike administrations, they allow business owners to offload unprofitable stores while retaining control of the company. But Kahn said the indications were that Austin Reed had support from creditors.\u201cWe consider the proposed CVAs to be fair and in the best interests of all stakeholders, providing certainty for landlords, and an ongoing future for the business,\u201d he said. Austin Reed Group is owned by Darius Capital, a group controlled by property tycoon Guy Naggar, who was previously involved in the now collapsed investment company Dawnay Day. Dawnay Day, which once owned the Chez Gerard restaurant chain, bought Austin Reed, then listed on the London Stock Exchange for \u00a349m, in 2006. The tailoring brand, whose customers have included Winston Churchill and Elizabeth Taylor, moved out of its vast London flagship at 113 Regent street in 2011, exchanging it for smaller premises over the road. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2015. An earlier version said that Austin Reed Group\u2019s owner was controlled by Guy Naggar and Peter Klimt. Klimt sold all his interests to Naggar in 2014.",

      "bodyText": "After all the turmoil of the Swiss central bank removing the currency cap against the euro, stock markets have moved sharply higher once more. Investors have become convinced the European Central Bank will unveil some kind of quantitative easing programme following its meeting next week, and the Swiss move has only added fuel to that particular fire. With oil and commodities also recovering some ground after their recent slides, shares have ended the week in fairly upbeat mood. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 51.49 points or 0.79% at 6550.27 Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.35% to 10167.77 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.31% at 4379.62 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.18% to 19,254.54 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.56% to 10,038.9 But the Swiss stock market continued to slide after the Swiss bank move, with the SMI index down 5.96% at 7899.59. The euro made an attempt at recovering against the Swiss franc in early trading, but that was fairly short lived. It is currently down 0.96% at 0.98 francs. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 53 points or 0.31%. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. Some speculation ahead of the ECB meeting next week, widely expected to unveil some form of quantitative easing: Meanwhile Reuters is reporting that Jefferies has expressed interest in a rescue deal for FXCM. The euro continues to sink, as the prospects of the European Central Bank unveiling plans for quantitative easing next week grow, and the repercussions of the Swiss removing the currency cap continue to reverberate. After an early recovery against the Swiss franc the euro is now down 0.65% at 0.98 francs, while it has also lost ground against the dollar: Meanwhile retail broker FXCM, which has admitted that it may be in breach of some regulatory capital requirements, is being monitored by US regulators after its shares tumbled around 90% A spokeswoman for the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission told Reuters: \u201cWe are reviewing the company\u2019s situation.\u201d And still they come. US retail trader Interactive Brokers lost around $120m due to Thursday\u2019s currency turmoil. In a statement it said: Due to the sudden move in the value of the Swiss franc yesterday, several of our customers suffered losses in excess of their deposit with us. Such debits amount to approximately $120m, less than 2.5% of our net worth. Here\u2019s Reuters full take on the Barclays story: Barclays lost tens of millions of dollars from the volatile moves in the Swiss franc on Thursday, an industry source said on Friday. Several banking sources said most major banks were likely to have lost money from the unprecedented surge in the value of the franc after the Swiss central bank abandoned a cap on the currency. Banks lost money because the franc moved so quickly firms could not immediately fill client orders, the sources said. The first industry source said Barclays would honour all the trades made in spot Swiss franc trading. Retail foreign exchange brokers were nursing hefty losses from the Swiss currency move and broker Alpari UK filed for insolvency. Back with US data, and consumer confidence has come in much higher than forecast, despite some weaker figures recently including retail sales. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index showed a preliminary reading of 98.2 for January, compared to expectations of 94.1 and a final figure for December of 93.6. Reuters is reporting sources saying Barclays lost \u201ctens of millions\u201d of dollars following the volatile currency movements on Thursday after the Swiss central bank removed its currency cap against the euro. Trading in US forex broker FXCM, which is battling for survival, has been delayed. Its stock tumbled nearly 90% in pre-market trading, as investors reacted to client losses suffered after the sharp appreciation of the Swiss franc yesterday. The broker has admitted that it may be in breach of some regulatory capital requirements. Credit Suisse said in a note: Absent an overnight capital raise FXCM will not be able to conduct business. Wall Street has opened slightly higher. The Dow Jones is 0.2% ahead at 17,358.41 and the Nasdaq has gained 0.42% to 4591.065. Most European stock markets have pushed into positive territory. The FTSE 100 index in London is trading nearly 30 points higher, or 0.4%, at 6527.09. The CAC in Paris is 0.5% ahead, Germany\u2019s Dax has edged up 0.1%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is 1.3% higher and Spain\u2019s Ibex is flat. However, Swiss stocks are still down 4.3% after hitting a 13-month low earlier in the session. Watchmakers Swatch and Richemont have both lost more than 6% after heavy losses yesterday. They are particularly vulnerable to a higher franc because their products are mainly produced in Switzerland but sold abroad. Meanwhile, Italy\u2019s central bank has slashed its growth forecast for this year and predicted that deflation would persist throughout the year. The Bank of Italy is now predicting 2015 growth of just 0.4% \u2013 the first time the economy has grown since 2011 \u2013 compared with 1.3% in July. The eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy has not posted a single quarter of growth in the last three years. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, met with ECB president Mario Draghi on Wednesday ahead of next week\u2019s policy meeting, at which the central bank is widely expected to unveil large-scale bond-buying. A German government spokesman told Reuters: It was one of the informal meetings that take place regularly. Here\u2019s more detail on the earlier news that two major Greek lenders have applied for emergency funding from the country\u2019s central bank. Executives at both Eurobank and Alpha said this was precautionary and related partly to their exposure to Swiss franc mortgages. Both have yet to make use of the emergency liquidity assistance funds. A Eurobank executive told Reuters: Swiss franc loan exposure is part of the reasons but not the main one. Greek banks\u2019 exposure to Swiss franc-denominated loans, mostly mortgages, ranges from 2 to 4% of their gross loans. Eurobank is more at risk with exposure of about 11% or \u20ac5.7bn, according to Euroxx Securities. More US data: Factory output rose 0.3% last month, the Federal Reserve said, slightly better than expected. That marks the fourth month in a row manufacturing has grown, although it was much slower than November\u2019s revised 1.3% growth. Bankers at Goldman Sachs were paid an average of $373,265 (\u00a3245,544) in 2014 after profits at the highest profile firm on Wall Street rose 5%, our banking correspondent Jill Treanor writes. Some $12.7bn was set aside to pay its 34,000 staff, who will learn the size of the individual payouts in the coming days. Some of them will receive far more than the average; data for 2013 shows that its most senior executives received an average of \u00a33m. But in the fourth quarter, profits at Goldman Sachs were down 7% after revenue fell in each of its four divisions - investment banking, client trading, lending and fund management - compared with a year earlier. US online trading platform Gain Capital says it made a profit on yesterday\u2019s market turmoil. Its CEO Glenn Stevens says: Our strong risk-management framework allowed us to generate a profit on one of the most turbulent days for the global currency markets in recent years... We have positioned ourselves to effectively manage risk during both calm and tumultuous markets and our performance during this recent event shows that. US consumer prices showed their biggest fall for six years in December, as the slump in oil prices took its effect. The consumer price index fell 0.4% last month, after declining 0.3% in November. In the 12 months to December, the index increased 0.8% after a 1.3% rise the previous month. The readings were pretty much in line with expectations, but add to the sense that recent weak US data might see a delay in the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Most economists expected an increase in borrowing costs in June, but this may be pushed back into the second half of the year. FXCM, the biggest US retail foreign-exchange brokerage, has seen its shares collapse in spectacular fashion in pre-market trading. Earlier it admitted it had been hit by the Swiss bank move and that client debts could mean it was in breach of some capital requirements. Swiss government bond yields continue to slide. Dublin-based online forex broker AvaTrade has sought to reassure customers by saying the Swiss turmoil has had no material effect on the company, and its financial position remains strong. The UKs Financial Conduct Authority says it is working closely with Alpari, the insolvent retail currency broker, the latest casualty of the Swiss currency chaos. Spread-betting firm City Index also said \u201cit\u2019s business as usual\u201d. It has come to our attention that a number of retail brokerages have announced that this has resulted in them experiencing acute financial pressure. Following this and queries from customers, we would like to take the opportunity to reassure our clients and confirm to the market that City Index has not suffered any material impact as a result of yesterday\u2019s volatility and our financial position has not been affected. It is very much business as usual for City Index and our global client base. Peter Cruddas, chief Executive of CMC Markets said while the firm has suffered \u201csome losses\u201d from the Swiss currency turmoil, it\u2019s business as usual. Yesterday\u2019s unprecedented move by the Swiss National Bank created a large amount of volatility in the Swiss Franc and Foreign Exchange markets. Like many of our competitors, CMC Markets sustained some losses, however, the overall impact including possible bad debts has not materially impacted the Group. The Group\u2019s balance sheet post these events remains strong, with a regulatory capital ratio of 24% (300% pre CRD IV) and own funds in excess of \u00a3130m. All retail client funds are fully segregated and protected. Some of our competitors may suffer as a result of this market event but CMC Markets continues to have a strong balance sheet and business model; the Group remains on course to exceed last year\u2019s financial performance. It\u2019s business as usual. Here are some more quotes from the IEA report, which has fuelled oil prices. The agency said in its monthly outlook: How low the market\u2019s floor will be is anybody\u2019s guess. But the sell-off is having an impact. A price recovery \u2013 barring any major disruption \u2013 may not be imminent, but signs are mounting that the tide will turn. A rebalancing may begin to occur in the second half of the year. Oil prices have lost nearly 60% since June as production around the world went up. Time for another look at the markets. The Swiss franc has weakened today after yesterday\u2019s huge gains. The euro now buys 1.0175 francs, up 2.7%. The Swiss stock market, however, is still down 4.6% at 8015.65 after falling more than 5% earlier. Swiss 10-year government bond yields have fallen below zero, marking the first time that the benchmark borrowing costs of a developed economy have gone negative. Crude oil prices have risen after the IEA said there are signs the tide may be turning. Brent crude is trading 2.3% higher at $49.37 a barrel. Most European stock markets are now down, with the exception of Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB, up 0.2%. The FTSE 100 index in London has shed about 17 points, or 0.3%, to 6481.50. It\u2019s not the first time West Ham have lost their sponsor (forex broker Alpari has filed for insolvency, which spells an end to its \u00a33m-a-year sponsorship for the London football club). Here\u2019s our story. In 2008, when its then-sponsor XL Leisure went bust, its players had to wear patches on their shirts. The Swiss stock market is still down more than 5% at 7976.83. Christoph Riniker, head of equity strategy at Julius Baer, warned investors not to sell Swiss equities at current levels. In contrast, he reckons that risk-aware investors might want to buy Swiss stocks. Foreign investors are partly hedged from these losses as they could gain on the foreign exchange side. Given the marked international sales exposure of Swiss companies in aggregate, the dependency on Swiss franc price moves is not to underestimate. Consequently, companies with higher international sales exposure were hit more while purely domestically oriented companies only saw minimal losses. Investors who hold positions in the Swiss equity market should remain patient and not sell on current levels. In contrast, we think that risk-aware investors might add Swiss equity exposure on current levels. There are a number of unanswered questions but after all, the Swiss economy has proved in the past that it can live with a strong Swiss franc. We would suggest concentrating on domestic and US dollar expo-sure and rather limit euro exposure going forward. We still believe that the US currency looks more robust than the euro, a tendency which might be even more pronounced once the ECB should start its quantitative easing programme. London Capital Group estimates its total exposure to the Swiss franc\u2019s surge at up to \u00a31.7m, but reckons there won\u2019t be a material impact on its business. The impact on the company\u2019s balance sheet from market and credit exposure will be dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to recover client debts, but in total it will not exceed \u00a31.7m. All clients\u2019 positions were closed at a more beneficial level than the company could close its own exposure. The group is well capitalised with a strong balance sheet upon which the recent events relating to the Swiss Franc has had no material impact. Swiss 10-year government bond yields have turned negative for the first time ever. They\u2019ve fallen to 0.003%, according to Tradeweb data. Meanwhile, oil prices could continue their slide, \u201cbut signs are mounting that the tide will turn,\u201d the International Energy Authority said in its latest monthly oil report. The agency has cut its estimate for non-OPEC oil supply growth this year by 350,000 barrels a day since last month, to 950,000. It added: \u201clower prices do not appear to be stimulating demand just yet\u201d. Brokers aren\u2019t the only casualties of the Swiss currency chaos. The Polish zloty tumbled more than 20% against the Swiss franc yesterday. In Poland, mortgages denominated in francs were worth 131bn zlotys at the end of November. However, FT Alphaville noted that is not very much, as a percentage of Poland\u2019s GDP, in a blog entitled Stop worrying about Swiss franc mortgages in Poland. The zloty fell 0.3% against the euro today but gained 1.6% against the franc as the Swiss currency pulled back from its highs. The Warsaw stock market shed 1.3%. Hungarian assets stabilised, with the forint rising 0.5% versus the euro. Just a reminder, London-based interdealer broker IG Group said yesterday it would take a hit of about \u00a330m following the Swiss turmoil. Alpari said in a statement on its website: The recent move on the Swiss franc caused by the Swiss National Bank\u2019s unexpected policy reversal of capping the Swiss franc against the euro has resulted in exceptional volatility and extreme lack of liquidity. This has resulted in the majority of clients sustaining losses which has exceeded their account equity. Where a client cannot cover this loss, it is passed on to us. This has forced Alpari (UK) Limited to confirm today, 16/01/15, that it has entered into insolvency. Retail client funds continue to be segregated in accordance with FCA rules. Elsewhere, the European Commission has issued a preliminary finding that Amazon\u2019s tax arrangements in Luxembourg probably amount to \u201cstate aid\u201d \u2013 despite Luxembourg\u2019s claims to the contrary. Alpari has turned off its phone lines, and emails are bouncing back as undeliverable, my colleague Jill Treanor tells me. The online broker\u2019s last tweet last night: Online forex broker Alpari UK, which sponsors West Ham football club, has entered insolvency after its clients suffered huge losses on the Swiss franc. Greece\u2019s Alpha Bank and Eurobank have applied for emergency liquidity assistance from the Greek central bank, Reuters reported, citing a banking source. The biggest US retail foreign-exchange brokerage FXCM also said client debts threatened its compliance with capital rules. FXCM said \u201cclients experienced significant losses\u201d after the franc\u2019s surge. This \u201cgenerated negative equity balances owed to FXCM of approximately $225m.\u201d The New York-based broker added: As a result of these debit balances, the company may be in breach of some regulatory capital requirements. We are actively discussing alternatives to return our capital to levels prior to today\u2019s events and discussing the matter with our regulators. Casualties from the Swiss currency shock include a New Zealand-based dealer that has gone bust. Global Brokers NZ said losses from the franc\u2019s surge are forcing it to shut down. Clients of the forex broker, which operates Excel Markets, have been told the company \u201ccan no longer meet regulatory minimum capitalization requirements of N$1,000,000 and will not be able to resume business.\u201d Here\u2019s the statement in full. New Zealand\u2019s Financial Market Authority said it would be \u201cseeking assurances that the client funds have been protected and segregated\u201d. Nick Parsons, the head of research for the UK and Europe at National Australia Bank, told Bloomberg: I would be astonished if we did not see more casualties. This was a 180-degree about turn by the SNB. People feel hurt and betrayed. BP is the biggest gainer on the FTSE 100 this morning, after a US judge ruled last night that the oil giant dumped 3.2m barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 \u2013 about a quarter less than the US government had calculated. This means that BP faces a maximum fine of $13.7bn, less than a potential penalty of $18bn. Even so, this would still be the largest fine handed out for pollution in US history. BP shares rose 1.9% to 400p on the news. JD Sports shares are also up, leading the FTSE 250 with a 7.2% gain to 505.83p, after a bumper Christmas trading update. The sports retailer upgraded its full-year profit forecasts after enjoying 12% growth in like-for-like sales in the five weeks to 3 January. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb writes: So Mike Ashley hasn\u2019t yet succeeded in wiping out his old rival JD Sports... Inflation in Europe\u2019s largest economy slowed to 0.2% in December, its slowest rate in over five years, Germany\u2019s federal statistics office Destatis confirmed. You can read the press release here. The Swiss stock market continues to slide, now down 3.8% at 8081.36, a fall of 319.25 points. The euro suffered its biggest one-day drop against the Swiss franc in history yesterday after the shock move from the Swiss central bank. The single currency is holding just above an 11-year trough amid expectations that the Swiss move points to QE from the ECB next week, a large-scale programme of bond-buying. The euro tumbled 30% to 0.8696 Swiss francs within minutes after the SNB\u2019s shock move yesterday, and is now trading at 1.0128. The FTSE 100 index in London is more than 20 points lower at 6477.15, a 0.3% fall. Germany\u2019s Dax has shed 0.26% but other markets are up: Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has gained 0.5% and Spain\u2019s Ibex 0.3%, while France\u2019s CAC is flat. Gold prices have benefited from the turmoil as investors piled into safe haven investments. Spot gold is trading at $1,257.80 an ounce, after jumping to $1,266.11 yesterday, a level last seen in September. Bullion is on course to notch up its best weekly performance since last March, up about 3% so far. James Gardiner, a trader at MKS Group, told Reuters: Gold looks like the flavour of the month at the moment... The SNB announcement has really shaken the market. The Swiss stock market has lost another 2.7% in early trading, after plummeting as much as 14% yesterday to close down 8.7%. The Swiss franc has fallen back after yesterday\u2019s massive gains, to 1.0184 per euro. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are expected to open lower after yesterday\u2019s Swiss turmoil. Overnight, most Asian markets fell, with the Nikkei in Tokyo down 1.4% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong losing 0.9%. Chinese stocks were a notable exception, with the Shanghai composite index gaining 1.2%, after the country\u2019s central bank announced it would increase relending quotas to banks by $8.1bn to support agriculture and small companies. Markets were caught on the hop and stocks plunged yesterday after the Swiss central bank ditched its currency cap against the euro. They recovered later and pushed into positive territory, with the exception of the Swiss stock market, which recorded its biggest daily percentage fall in 25 years, of 8.7%. Markets took heart from suggestions that the Swiss move meant the European Central Bank could finally unveil quantitative easing next week. The Swiss franc jumped as much as 30% yesterday. The euro tumbled, from buying 1.20 francs to buying just 0.8052 at one stage, but it later recovered to around 1.04. The Polish Zloty and Hungarian forint were also hit hard yesterday, and could well be hit further, says Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s head, Christine Lagarde, called the Swiss National Bank\u2019s decision \u201ca bit of a surprise\u201d. She said she had not been contacted by the SNB\u2019s governor, and that she hoped he had told fellow central bank governors about his plan. Thomas Jordan declined to comment on this at a press conference yesterday. Equity market calls, courtesy of Hewson: FTSE100 is expected to open 53 points lower at 6,445 DAX is expected to open 62 points lower at 9,970 CAC40 is expected to open 33 points lower at 4,290",

Investors have become convinced the European Central Bank will unveil some kind of quantitative easing programme following its meeting next week, and the Swiss move has only added fuel to that particular fire. With oil and commodities also recovering some ground after their recent slides, shares have ended the week in fairly upbeat mood. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 51.49 points or 0.79% at 6550.27</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.35% to 10167.77</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.31% at 4379.62</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.18% to 19,254.54</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.56% to 10,038.9</strong></li> </ul> <p>But the Swiss stock market continued to slide after the Swiss bank move, with the SMI index down 5.96% at 7899.59.</p> <p>The euro made an attempt at recovering against the Swiss franc in early trading, but that was fairly short lived. It is currently down 0.96% at 0.98 francs.</p> <p>Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 53 points or 0.31%.</p> <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the day and indeed the week.

Hence, the UK operations of <strong>National Grid</strong> would fit the bill in theory. However, we believe that there could potentially be national security sensitivities with the both the gas and electricity transmission systems, depending on the acquirer, although there should be less of an issue with the gas distribution networks. <strong>SSE</strong> also has gas distribution and electricity transmission assets, along with its EDNs.</p> <p>Thus, we believe there is still life in the takeover market for UK infrastructure assets, with purchasers likely to be primarily from wealthy Far eastern entities, from Sovereign Funds and other, similar, cash-rich players.</p> <p>Additionally, the recent Water Act has opened up the possibility of Water-Water takeovers, without automatic referral to the competition authorities, along with the potential for consolidation of their retail activities\u2019</p> <p>However, the precise timing of any further potential bid remains the question and the share prices of the Waters are, we believe, currently reflecting at least some of this potential. In recent history, takeover premiums to regulatory asset bases...seem to have been in the 25-33% area, whereas our current water target prices use 20%.</p> <p>We see takeovers in the generation and supply markets as less likely in the current environment. The latter is currently facing... political/regulatory interference, including the ongoing Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation which will overshadow supply activities for the next 12-18 months.</p> <p>Additionally, it is already apparent that the supply activities will continue to feature politically ahead of the 7 May General Election, and with preliminary findings due from the CMA in June. Generation also faces a number of uncertainties under the Government\u2019s Electricity Market Reform, coupled with a dearth of obvious buyers, especially as European players appear to currently be retrenching in Europe rather than expanding, and with lower wholesale commodity prices having a number of impacts, with the negatives probably outweighing the positives.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the current volatile market utilitie shares are mainly higher.

However, we believe that there could potentially be national security sensitivities with the both the gas and electricity transmission systems, depending on the acquirer, although there should be less of an issue with the gas distribution networks. SSE also has gas distribution and electricity transmission assets, along with its EDNs. Thus, we believe there is still life in the takeover market for UK infrastructure assets, with purchasers likely to be primarily from wealthy Far eastern entities, from Sovereign Funds and other, similar, cash-rich players. Additionally, the recent Water Act has opened up the possibility of Water-Water takeovers, without automatic referral to the competition authorities, along with the potential for consolidation of their retail activities\u2019 However, the precise timing of any further potential bid remains the question and the share prices of the Waters are, we believe, currently reflecting at least some of this potential. In recent history, takeover premiums to regulatory asset bases...seem to have been in the 25-33% area, whereas our current water target prices use 20%. We see takeovers in the generation and supply markets as less likely in the current environment. The latter is currently facing... political/regulatory interference, including the ongoing Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation which will overshadow supply activities for the next 12-18 months. Additionally, it is already apparent that the supply activities will continue to feature politically ahead of the 7 May General Election, and with preliminary findings due from the CMA in June. Generation also faces a number of uncertainties under the Government\u2019s Electricity Market Reform, coupled with a dearth of obvious buyers, especially as European players appear to currently be retrenching in Europe rather than expanding, and with lower wholesale commodity prices having a number of impacts, with the negatives probably outweighing the positives. In the current volatile market utilitie shares are mainly higher. Severn Trent is up 8p at \u00a321.12, United Utilities has edged up 1p to 952p but Pennon has dipped 4p to 889.5p. National Grid is up 1.7p at 912.6p and SSE has climbed 17p to \u00a314.97.",

      "bodyText": "West Ham FC sponsor Alpari UK has become one of the biggest casualties of Thursday\u2019s turmoil on currency markets sparked by the Swiss central bank abandoning its attempt to peg the franc against the euro. Alpari UK, an online foreign exchange dealer, said it was insolvent because of the scale of the losses suffered by its clients after the shock move by the Swiss sparked wild swings in the \u00a33.5tn-a-day foreign exchange markets. The repercussions of Thursday\u2019s drama were being felt across the globe on Friday. In New Zealand, Global Brokers NZ said it was closing down as it could no longer meet local regulatory requirements and in New York the US foreign exchange brokerage FXCM was scrambling to raise funds to avert collapse. Shares in FXCM slumped 40% ahead of a formal announcement about its future after it admitted it faced $225m of losses. In London, rumours swept through dealing floors about potential losses following the surprise decision on Thursday by the Swiss to stop holding their currency at SFr1.20 against the euro. The move led to a temporary seizure in the markets and the franc leaped an unprecedented 30% against the euro. Late on Friday the euro was trading at SFr0.98, above the SFr0.80 it had slumped to at one stage on Thursday but far off the Sfr1.20 that dealers had assumed would remain in place. There were reports Barclays and Deutsche Bank had lost millions. Sterling jumped to its highest level against the euro for seven years, prompting foreign exchange dealers to recommend that holidaymakers lock in now. The pound rose to \u20ac1.315 to the euro, 9% higher than this time last year and nearly 20% above the rate holidaymakers paid in summer 2011. In the immediate aftermath of Thursday\u2019s move by the Swiss central bank, analysts at Alpari had described the decision as \u201cidiotic\u201d and by Friday the firm had announced it was insolvent. \u201cThe recent move on the Swiss franc caused by the Swiss National Bank\u2019s unexpected policy reversal of capping the Swiss franc against the euro has resulted in exceptional volatility and extreme lack of liquidity,\u201d said Alpari. \u201cThis has resulted in the majority of clients sustaining losses that have exceeded their account equity. Where a client cannot cover this loss, it is passed on to us.\u201d It said any funds held on behalf of clients were kept in separate accounts as required by rules imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority. Some clients were said to have accounts of \u00a32m to \u00a33m. Alpari, which signed a three-year \u00a39m deal with West Ham in 2013 is not the first of the club\u2019s sponsors to run into trouble. In 2008 XL, then Britain\u2019s third-largest package holiday group, collapsed. IG Index was the first broker on Thursday to announce it could face \u00a330m of losses, and similar announcements followed yesterday from other firms. Spread-better London Capital said it had \u00a31.7m of exposure as its shares fell 16% while other firms, such as City Index, were issuing statements reassuring their clients. \u201cIt has come to our attention that a number of retail brokerages have announced that this has resulted in them experiencing acute financial pressure. Following this and queries from customers, we would like to take the opportunity to reassure our clients and confirm to the market that City Index has not suffered any material impact as a result of yesterday\u2019s volatility and our financial position has not been affected,\u201d City Index said. CMC, the money broker which is run by former Conservative Party treasurer Peter Cruddas, said it too had incurred losses but said the business was still strong. \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual,\u201d Cruddas said. Companies such as Travelex, HiFX and CaxtonFX which allow customers to exchange currency or transfer cash overseas to order rather than offering customers trading accounts said they were unaffected. \u201cWe are very different to Alpari, which was designed for people who want to speculate,\u201d said James Hickman, managing director of CaxtonFX. \u201cBut I\u2019m surprised they went bust so quickly. Ultimately, they should be able to go back to the client to recover the money they lost. But all the brokerages will be hurting today. They have been offering huge leverage and will now be cutting back the amount of leverage they allow clients to have.\u201d",

Elsewhere Imperial Tobacco has added 48p to \u00a328.98 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price to \u00a332.50 from \u00a326.80 with an overweight rating and Nomura moved from \u00a324.90 to \u00a325.10. Morgan Stanley said it expected the proposed purchase of US brands from Reynolds and Lorillard to go ahead: Despite an opaque Federal Trade Commission [FTC} approval process and continued evidence of market skepticism, we are increasingly optimistic on the completion of Imperial\u2019s proposed $7bn US acquisition, given: (i) Reynolds\u2019 view of a potential FTC response in February/March; (ii) The absence of any publicly visible governmental opposition; (iii) The companies\u2019 decision to schedule shareholder votes for January 28; and (iv) Prior factors such as Reynolds\u2019 earlier antitrust diligence and proactive divestitures. While we are retaining our existing forecasts pending deal closure, we see strong visibility to potential 2016 estimated return on invested capital of 10% plus and earnings per share accretion of over 16%, with secondary contributions from a tax shield and further debt refinancing. Also, our analysis of the acquired brands\u2019 financial disclosure suggests significant flexibility to both reposition the price point of Winston and reduce controllable costs (which appear on a pro forma basis to be very elevated) to deliver $800m plus in EBITDA while reshaping the value equation on these brands. Dixons Carphone is down 10p at 424.4p on worries about Christmas trading in the wake of Argos figures on Thursday. But JD Sports Fashion has climbed 31.9p to 508p following a strong festive performance and a forecast its full year profit will beat market expectations.",
