Workers represented by the union Bectu have announced plans to disrupt the British Film Institute\u2019s London film festival between 4 and 15 October, with nine days of strike action over the period in a dispute over the living wage and other rights, including sick pay. However, as the dispute enters a second year, the cinema chain has rejected the claim that the strike action is valid. \u201cAny employee taking part in those strikes is likely to be dismissed,\u201d lawyers representing Picturehouse said in a letter sent to Bectu and seen by the Guardian. The union said workers would strike at five London cinemas \u2013 the Ritzy in Brixton, Hackney Picturehouse, Crouch End Picturehouse, East Dulwich Picturehouse, and Picturehouse Central. Obi Saiq, one of the striking workers at Hackney Picturehouse, said: \u201cWe are striking for a wage that we can live on and for basic rights at work \u2013 and until Picturehouse negotiates with us, which they haven\u2019t done in over a year of strike action, we have no choice but to fight. Our strike action will go ahead, and we expect to significantly disrupt the London film festival.\u201d Bectu claims that Picturehouse and its owner, Cineworld, refuse to negotiate on demands for the London living wage, company sick pay for all, maternity, paternity and adoption pay, and the reinstatement of four sacked union reps at the Ritzy. \u201cPicturehouse management know they have no legal grounds to stop the proposed strike action during the London film festival and have now resorted to threatening their own staff,\u201d said Gerry Morrissey, general secretary of Bectu. \u201cWe will not be bullied and we will robustly defend any legal action. If the Picturehouse management are confident that they are paying the living wage why have they not signed up as a living wage employer? We challenge them to do so.\u201d The London living wage is calculated by an independent body, the Living Wage Foundation, and is \u00a39.75 an hour. A spokesperson for Cineworld said: \u201cThis is an issue for Picturehouse and its management team and we hope that the dispute is resolved as quickly as possible.\u201d Picturehouse did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment on Sunday, but in a statement on 20 September on its website, it said: \u201cFront-of-house staff at London Picturehouses are paid \u00a39.30 per hour, equivalent to \u00a39.92 per hour when working an eight-hour shift as we choose to pay for breaks. \u201cStaff at The Ritzy Picturehouse London are represented by Bectu and agreed a rate of \u00a39.10 per hour \u2013 equivalent to \u00a39.70 with a paid break \u2013 from 2 September 2016.\u201d The British Film Institute has previously said it supported the Picturehouse workers\u2019 call for payment of the London living wage, which it paid its own employees.",

      "bodyText": "Comic Relief and Fairtrade have joined forces with the Dutch government to back a $15m (\u00a311m) scheme to support ethical gold mining in east Africa after a successful pilot project in Uganda. About a fifth of the world\u2019s gold produced every year comes from small-scale mines where millions of people work in hazardous conditions without access to modern technology. They resort to extracting and crushing ore by hand before using water and then highly toxic mercury or cyanide to separate the gold. The ad hoc process is not only harmful for the individuals involved, some of whom are children, but pollutes their local environment. It is also highly inefficient, on average extracting only 40% of the available gold. Fairtrade is working with specialist mining consultancy the Dragonfly Initiative in trying to raise up to $4m in investment by 2020 from specialist environmental and social investors, government bodies and big business to help small-scale artisanal mines. Half of the funds will be loans to support investment in better technology and the other half grants to support building the organisational change necessary. \u201cWe are trying to generate a proof of concept which has the possibility to bring economic benefits to thousands of families. We also hope over time to increase supply of Fairtrade gold,\u201d said David Finlay of Fairtrade. At present only about 400kg of the ethical precious metal is produced ever year. \u201cMiners want to improve standards but it is a real struggle. They want access to finance to acquire equipment and reduce reliance on mercury and enhance the recovery of gold. There will be both an economic and environmental benefit,\u201d Finlay said. Using a centrifuge device, which costs about $5,000, increased the extraction rate for gold to 70% in the Uganda trial. But introducing the machinery is only part of the answer alongside supporting miners to work in a more organised and safe way. Comic Relief has already committed $90,000 to help provide seed finance for a trial project at about four mines over the last few years and devise the funding scheme. It is hoped that as many as 60 small mines could be helped by 2020 using the new money raised. That could increase the supply of Fairtrade gold, most of which currently comes from Peru. The first shipment from Uganda resulting from the trial investment project will be made next month. Meanwhile the Dragonfly Initiative is aiming to raise $10m or more to support communities surrounding large commercial mines. That part of the scheme does not involve Fairtrade. Its aim is to help local people move away from unsafe informal digging for minerals towards more sustainable, environmentally friendly and safer businesses such as agriculture. Assheton Stewart Carter from Dragonfly said similar schemes had already been tried in South America where mining areas had been reforested with trees producing fruit local people could harvest and sell. He said international mining companies and an increasing number of electronics and automotive manufacturers who used precious metals were becoming interested in ensuring that their resources were not contributing to environmental or social problems. \u201cA few years ago companies wanted to know that no bad stuff was happening at their mine. Now they want to show they are part of the solution, that the mine is not just looking after itself while causing problems for its neighbours.",

      "bodyText": "I applaud the Guardian for its investigative journalism that resulted in the report on the unacceptably poor standards of hygiene in a large poultry processing plant, which supplies many of this country\u2019s large supermarkets. Your findings (UK\u2019s top supplier of supermarket chicken fiddles food safety dates, 29 September) call into question the acceptability of the proposals that emerged from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in July in a document entitled Regulating Our Future. The FSA proposed reducing the frequency of public inspections of food safety standards for the major retailers, and concentrating on smaller firms that were presumed to be less able to ensure the safety of their products. The FSA proposed that the large supermarkets could outsource inspections to commercial contractors, who could audit and verify the safety of their systems. That proposal assumed that the supermarkets are already reliably delivering safe products and high standards, an assumption that was undermined by your report and by a recent report from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism entitled \u201cBlowing the whistle on the meat industry\u201d. Moreover, the FSA\u2019s proposals could allow the supermarkets and their commercial contractors to keep unwelcome news out of the public domain, while the information gathered by local authority environmental health officers and public analysts would more likely be made public, as it would be subject to the provisions of freedom of information legislation. Much of the fault lies not with the FSA, or local authorities, but with the government, which has cut the FSA\u2019s budget and funding for local authorities to the extent that they can no longer consistently enforce food safety regulations in this country. If we are to avoid a continuing stream of food safety scandals, we need properly resourced public agencies that are publically accountable. Professor Emeritus Erik Millstone Freeman Centre, University of Sussex, Brighton \u2022 In his review of the 2014 horsemeat scandal, Professor Chris Elliott reported that local authority enforcement services had been cut to the bone, with any further cuts leaving local authorities unable to effectively protect consumers from fraudsters. Now he calls for environmental health officers to undertake a thorough investigation of 2 Sisters. But with numbers of inspectors dropping from 1,050 in 2009-10 to 736 in 2014\u201315 and cuts in environmental health budgets leading to a 70% decline in business visits since 2010, there just aren\u2019t sufficient EHOs to keep the public safe any more. A fraction of the estimated wealth of 2 Sisters\u2019 owners, \u00a3544m (which according to the Sunday Times Rich List is a \u00a3114m increase on 2016), could pay for a fully functioning UK environmental health service. Billionaire owners, exploited workers, ill-equipped inspection regimes, ripped-off consumers and public health threatened: this is Theresa May\u2019s free market at work. Mike Campbell Bristol \u2022 Why the surprise that there is seemingly malpractice in the poultry supply chain as reported? One key finding from our research for the Economic and Social Research Council\u2019s \u201cUnderstanding the challenges of the food supply system\u201d was that the structure of, and operating cultures within, the food market are such that unethical practices are embedded in the daily food-processing, production and distribution systems and practices because of the economic demands that exist at every level. Small margins, just-in-time delivery clauses, unfair contractual practices and the need to squeeze profit at every level create conditions whereby some businesses can barely survive, making the food market highly dysfunctional, except for those corporate actors that are able to influence the structure of these markets. What is apparent is that there is an interaction between market (dys)functionality and criminal opportunity in legitimate businesses, as unethical behaviours can be easily concealed behind the normal, common business practices carried out by otherwise legitimate market actors. If we look at the large number of food fraud incidents, these are in the main \u201cinside jobs\u201d and not the work of external criminal enterprises, such as organised crime groups, trying to make a fast buck. Questions need asking of the whole food system. What we need to do urgently is reform our food supply markets to ensure authenticity, sustainability and market resilience. Jon Spencer Reader in criminology Dr Nick Lord Senior lecturer in criminology Dr Cecilia Flores Elizondo Research fellow Centre of criminology and criminal Justice, School of Law, University of Manchester \u2022 The current row about the supply of chickens to supermarkets highlights a recurring issue of food in our society. Who is to blame? Supermarkets, certainly, for believing that their customers will only buy food priced at the lowest possible level. But politicians and wider society need to relook at our relationship with food in general. Despite the fact that we now boast some of the best restaurants in the world, we seem more disconnected than ever from what we eat and I would argue that we really do not have a food culture in our country, except at the margins. People feel that it is normal to eat the cheapest food they can buy without understanding the health and environmental costs. They believe processed food to be both cheaper and quicker to cook when it is neither. There should be a real attempt to reconnect us to the food we grow, sell and eat. Without it this crisis in the food chain will continue. The question is, do we have a government that cares enough to do something about it? Tony Schendel Salisbury, Wiltshire \u2022 Yet another reason to go vegetarian, or at least buy meat only from local, known farmers.

If we are to avoid a continuing stream of food safety scandals, we need properly resourced public agencies that are publically accountable.<br><strong>Professor Emeritus Erik Millstone</strong><br><em>Freeman Centre, University of Sussex, Brighton</em></p> <p>\u2022 In his review of the 2014 horsemeat scandal, Professor Chris Elliott reported that local authority enforcement services had been cut to the bone, with any further cuts leaving local authorities unable to effectively protect consumers from fraudsters. Now he calls for environmental health officers to undertake a thorough investigation of 2 Sisters. But with numbers of inspectors dropping from 1,050 in 2009-10 to 736 in 2014\u201315 and cuts in environmental health budgets leading to a 70% decline in business visits since 2010, there just aren\u2019t sufficient EHOs to keep the public safe any more. A fraction of the estimated wealth of 2 Sisters\u2019 owners, \u00a3544m (which according to the Sunday Times Rich List is a \u00a3114m increase on 2016), could pay for a fully functioning UK environmental health service. Billionaire owners, exploited workers, ill-equipped inspection regimes, ripped-off consumers and public health threatened: this is Theresa May\u2019s free market at work.<br><strong>Mike Campbell</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 Why the surprise that there is seemingly malpractice in the poultry supply chain as reported? One key finding from our research for the Economic and Social Research Council\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/understanding-the-challenges-food-system-spec.pdf\" title=\"\">Understanding the challenges of the food supply system</a>\u201d was that the structure of, and operating cultures within, the food market are such that unethical practices are embedded in the daily food-processing, production and distribution systems and practices because of the economic demands that exist at every level. Small margins, just-in-time delivery clauses, unfair contractual practices and the need to squeeze profit at every level create conditions whereby some businesses can barely survive, making the food market highly dysfunctional, except for those corporate actors that are able to influence the structure of these markets.</p> <p>What is apparent is that there is an&#xa0;interaction between market (dys)functionality and criminal opportunity in legitimate businesses, as unethical behaviours can be easily concealed behind the normal, common business practices carried out by otherwise legitimate market actors. If we look at the large number of food fraud incidents, these are in the main \u201cinside jobs\u201d and not the work of external criminal enterprises, such as organised crime groups, trying to make a fast buck. Questions need asking of the whole food system. What we need to do urgently is reform our food supply markets to ensure authenticity, sustainability and market resilience.<br><strong>Jon Spencer</strong> <em>Reader in criminology</em><br><strong>Dr Nick Lord</strong> <em>Senior lecturer in criminology</em><br><strong>Dr Cecilia Flores Elizondo</strong> <em>Research fellow</em><br><em>Centre of criminology and criminal Justice, School of Law, University of Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 The current row about the supply of chickens to supermarkets highlights a recurring issue of food in our society. Who is to blame? Supermarkets, certainly, for believing that their customers will only buy food priced at the lowest possible level. But politicians and wider society need to relook at our relationship with food in general. Despite the fact that we now boast some of the best restaurants in the world, we seem more disconnected than ever from what we eat and I would argue that we really do not have a food culture in our country, except at the margins. People feel that it is normal to eat the cheapest food they can buy without understanding the health and environmental costs. They believe processed food to be both cheaper and quicker to cook when it is neither.</p> <p>There should be a real attempt to reconnect us to the food we grow, sell and eat. Without it this crisis in the food chain will continue. The question is, do we have a government that cares enough to do something about it?<br><strong>Tony Schendel</strong><br><em>Salisbury, Wiltshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Yet another reason to go vegetarian, or at least buy meat only from local, known farmers.<br><strong>Rachel Meredith</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>click here to visit gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",

His government since 2010 has placed order after order after order with Boeing for helicopters when they could have been made under licence in the UK, keeping British aerospace workers in a job. His incompetent government scrapped \u00a34bn worth of BAE Nimrod submarine hunters in 2010. After a Russian periscope was spotted off the Faslane nuclear facility in 2012, they then ordered \u00a33bn worth of inferior Boeing P-8s. This deal has no substantial UK offset, doesn\u2019t use UK-sourced arms and wasn\u2019t hedged against currency movements. The icing on the cake is that these Boeings can\u2019t even be refuelled in the air by the RAF. According to Unite the union, by 2020 a quarter of the UK\u2019s defence budget will be spent in the US, mainly because it\u2019s the ideological choice of the Tories to \u201cbuy off the shelf\u201d US kit rather than UK hardware. We are losing the ability to produce our own defence hardware. Another irony is that he threatens a trade war against the very country his government is desperate to do a trade deal with after the EU referendum. He would be better off getting David Davis engaging with the EU as we\u2019d have more success together against the US with our European allies than on our own. If Fallon is sincere about UK aerospace jobs he would: commit to join with France and Germany in developing a manned sixth-generation European fighter jet; order new BAE Hawks to replace ones the Red Arrows currently fly that are due to go out of service in 2018; ensure that any orders given to Boeing for helicopters are made under licence in the UK and use Rolls-Royce engines and UK avionics as well. Finally he could also help to ensure that Airbus UK is not penalised with tariffs and regulations when we leave the EU. We need deeds, not words. Alan Quinn Manchester \u2022 One of the best examples to illustrate the double standards being applied regarding US criticism of the state subsidies supporting Bombardier is that of the Boeing 747. The project was originally planned as a military aircraft. The research, design, technology construction and manufacture of prototype components was totally subsidised by the US government. On completion all this was simply transferred to the civil production arm of Boeing and industrially manufactured and marketed as the Boeing 747 (and later 8) intercontinental jumbo jet. It was then bought by, and freely traded to, airlines across the world. Ronald Fairfax Hull \u2022 If Sir Michael Fallon actually failed to continue the Boeing MoD contracts, the results after a few days would be the grounding of three of the armed forces\u2019 most important aerospace assets: the C-17 Globemaster III, Apache and Chinook helicopters.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The country\u2019s largest supplier of supermarket chicken has suspended production at one of its main processing plants after undercover filming revealed poor hygiene standards and food safety records being altered. The temporary closure by 2 Sisters Food Group (2SFG), which will now put employees at the plant through a retraining programme, came as Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest supermarket chain, joined the boycott of the poultry group\u2019s West Midlands plant in the wake of a joint undercover investigation by the Guardian and ITV News. A spokesman for 2SFG, which supplies a third of all poultry products eaten in the UK, said: \u201cWe are shocked and distressed by the allegations and the footage which we saw for the first time on Thursday 28 September. Since the allegations were put to us by the Guardian/ITV, we have been working around the clock to get to the truth of the matter. \u201cThe Food Standards Agency (FSA) has been in daily attendance since the allegations were raised and confirmed that it has not identified any breaches. However, our internal investigation has shown some isolated instances of non-compliance with our own quality management systems. \u201cWe have therefore decided to temporarily suspend operations at the site to allow us the time to retrain all colleagues including management in all food safety and quality management systems.\u201d A Tesco spokesperson added: \u201cFollowing last week\u2019s allegations of poor practices at 2 Sisters we conducted additional quality assurance tests. We\u2019d like to reassure customers our initial investigation supported the Food Standards Agency\u2019s findings that there was no current evidence of breach of food safety procedures. However, there have been isolated incidents where food quality procedures have not been followed and therefore, in agreement with 2 Sisters we have decided to suspend all orders from Site D so that staff can receive further training. We will not be taking any more chicken from the site until this has been addressed and all processes are carried out to the highest standard.\u201d Tesco\u2019s move emerged after the retailer initially resisted halting supplies from 2 Sisters Food Group\u2019s West Bromwich site, despite four rivals suspending deliveries from the plant. Instead, Tesco placed inspectors inside the West Midlands facility in order to oversee the chicken processor\u2019s production team. But the grocer reversed that stance on Sunday evening. On Friday Marks &amp; Spencer, Aldi and Lidl all announced they had suspended deliveries from the 2 Sisters plant, while Sainsbury\u2019s followed suit a day later. M&amp;S said the footage showed \u201cunacceptable\u201d standards and also pulled chicken sourced from the plant from its shelves. The moves came after the Guardian and ITV released undercover footage on Thursday showing an instance of 2 Sisters workers altering the source and slaughter date of poultry being processed in the firm\u2019s Site D plant. Experts said altering \u201ckill dates\u201d could artificially stretch the commercial life of the meat and dupe consumers into buying chicken past its use-by date. It is illegal to place incorrect use-by dates on food, which are set for safety reasons and differ from \u201cbest before\u201d dates. Other sections of the footage, which was filmed in August, showed chicken being picked off the floor and thrown back on to the production line, and older poultry being mixed with fresher birds. All five grocers supplied with chicken from the plant quickly announced their own investigations, as did the Food Standards Agency, which had conducted nine audits at the site - five of which were unannounced - in the months of July and August. The regulator has urged \u201canyone with information for this investigation\u201d to make contact. The chairman of parliament\u2019s environment, food and rural affairs committee, Neil Parish, said on Friday he was preparing to call 2 Sisters founder, Ranjit Singh Boparan, to Westminster to answer questions about the scandal. 2 Sisters Food Group is the UK\u2019s second largest food company by turnover and claims to process around 6 million chickens every week. It is owned by Ranjit Singh Boparan and his wife, Baljinder Kaur Boparan, and the chicken operations \u2013 which include 12 sites in the UK \u2013 are part of a sprawling \u00a33bn food empire that separately includes the turkey producer Bernard Matthews, the restaurant chains Harry Ramsden, FishWorks and Giraffe, plus food brands such as Fox\u2019s Biscuits and Goodfella\u2019s pizza. The company added that its staff \u201cwill remain on full pay and will attend the site\u201d while the company overhauls its procedures and that operations will only recommence once the firm is satisfied its staff have been properly retrained. \u201cWe continue to work closely with the FSA and our customers throughout this period. We remain committed to ensuring that we operate to the highest standards of hygiene and food safety, and we act with honesty and integrity at all times,\u201d the company said.",

      "bodyText": "A transatlantic salvage operation will put to sea within days to recover some of the estimated \u00a3125bn worth of gold and other precious metals sunk by German U-boats while being shipped to pay for Britain\u2019s first and second world war efforts. Britannia\u2019s Gold, a UK firm that has spent 25 years analysing cargo lost at sea, will set sail in secret from an unannounced port to explore the first cluster of shipwrecks it hopes will yield treasure. If successful, the loot will be taken to a secure location, from which the company will negotiate a price with the UK government for its return. The company plans to explore dozens of shipwrecks stretching from the north Atlantic to the Caribbean, believing it can recover around 2,000 tonnes of bounty. Will Carrier, operational director of Britannia\u2019s Gold, said the company had an unrivalled opportunity thanks to painstaking analysis of insurance records discovered by one of its senior researchers. \u201cHe came across a document written by an adviser to wartime chancellor of the exchequer Reginald McKenna, in amongst a box of last will and testaments of deceased sailors. \u201cIt clearly indicated gold movements made on behalf of the government on requisitioned merchant liners, which were named, with values of gold and when they sailed.\u201d He said that while rival salvage experts may know the location of wrecks, they would not have Britannia\u2019s Gold\u2019s information about what was on board, gleaned thanks to cross-referencing war-risk insurance payouts with shipwreck data. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive jigsaw to piece together and it took decades to do so,\u201d he said. Most of the precious metal was gold or silver being moved to the US to pay for the war effort, or to parts of the British empire, mainly from Glasgow and Liverpool. Many of these ships were sunk by German U-boats lying in wait in shallow waters off Ireland as they tried to choke off the UK\u2019s ability to import and export. The first three wrecks Britannia\u2019s Gold plans to explore include a first world war ship sunk en route to Canada and believed to contain gold worth \u00a3450m. The first stage of the salvage effort will see Britannia\u2019s Gold deploy a vessel with state-of-the-art technology that allows it to stay in position above the wrecks. There, its staff will analyse data sent to the surface by a remotely operated vehicle, which will explore wrecks at depths of up to 5,500m to determine the position of valuable material. Britannia\u2019s Gold, has already raised money from private investors and its own directors but is seeking further investment via crowdfunding business Angel EQT, in an effort to raise the \u00a38m it needs for the first salvage mission. Britannia\u2019s Gold said it could not disclose the port it will be sailing from, the location of the wrecks, or where it would take any finds, for fear of alerting pirates. \u201cWe\u2019ve got millions of pounds of gold on board so we\u2019re an automatic target and we have to play our cards close to our chest,\u201d Carrier said. The firm will also have to tread a careful path with the government, which is technically the rightful owner of the cargoes. It would be obliged to hand any cargo brought into British waters over to a government official known as the Receiver of Wreck, unless it negotiates an alternative arrangement first. That means it will have to land the cargo elsewhere and agree a split with the government before it returns to British waters. \u2022 This story was amended on 2 October 2017 to correct the statement that the salvage operation will launch on Monday. The name of the company was corrected to Britannia\u2019s Gold, and the operational director was also corrected, to Will Carrier.",

Analysts at Deutsche Bank are expecting the supermarket to announce on Wednesday a rise in like-for-like sales in the second quarter to 2% from 0.9% a year ago, despite the continuing competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. They are forecasting underlying half-year earnings of \u00a3713m, up from \u00a3596m. There is some suggestion that Tesco could start paying a dividend again. Clive Black at Shore Capital said: \u201cManagement has guided, through the Booker merger announcement, its intention to recommence dividend payouts in [2017-18]. Our central expectation is that this would more likely than not to be a final payout but we shall watch with interest to see if a token is offered at the interim stage. Such a move would be welcome and express confidence.\u201d Deutsche said: \u201cWe expect an interim dividend of 1.05p to be declared, representing 30% of our full-year expected dividend per share of 3.5p.\u201d No real news is expected on Tesco\u2019s proposed \u00a33.7bn purchase of cash-and-carry group Booker, announced in January, with competition authorities set to issue preliminary findings by the end of October. At the results, directors are likely to be quizzed about the Guardian and ITV News investigation that found evidence that chicken supplier 2 Sisters Food Group\u2019s West Bromwich plant had tampered with food safety records. Meanwhile, the legacy of the 2014 accounting scandal will be in the spotlight again this week as the fraud trial of three former executives, Carl Rogberg, John Scouler and Christopher Bush, continues. Hoping the wheels don\u2019t come off Vehicle hire business Northgate might have thought the worst thing that could happen at Wednesday\u2019s investor day would be cliched stuff about white van man. Instead, the board may have to fend off questions about last week\u2019s decision to dismiss chief financial officer Paddy Gallagher. The company said Gallagher\u2019s departure had followed \u201chis conviction for the summary offence of common assault\u201d. The conviction related to his personal life, said Northgate, but it considered his position \u201cuntenable\u201d. How much more it can say is open to question, but it might give some indication as to whether David Tilston, the ex-Consort Medical executive appointed as interim chief finance officer, is likely to get the job full time. A chartered accountant, Gallagher had previously worked at Spirit Pub Company, Rank and Dell. He joined the Northgate board in February 2016, and last year took home \u00a3402,000. He will now lose out on share options worth \u00a3487,499, according to the company\u2019s annual report. On the trading front, analysts will be looking for confirmation that the positive start outlined at its annual meeting last month has continued. Even the Davos boffins are worried Ten years after the global financial crisis sent shockwaves around the world, the World Economic Forum \u2013 the brains behind the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos \u2013 has warned of a possible new downturn. It said in a report on global competitiveness: \u201cThe prospects for a sustained economic recovery remain at risk due to a widespread failure on the part of leaders and policymakers to put in place reforms necessary to underpin competitiveness and bring about much-needed increases in productivity.\u201d The Bank of England recently warned of a potential consumer debt crisis, and the WEF said this was timely since there was evidence that the global banking system was less sound than before the financial crisis. In some parts of the world, conditions were declining further, it added. Still, if a UK bank does run into trouble again, the taxpayer should be off the hook this time. On Monday the Bank of England is due to give an update on its approach if a bank goes bust, with investors rather than taxpayers picking up the bill. As a reminder, the UK government put \u00a320bn into Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 now fully repaid \u2013 and \u00a346bn into Royal Bank of Scotland in return for stakes in the banks.",

      "bodyText": "The golden age for central banks is over. That much was plain from the two-day shindig held by the Bank of England to mark the 20th anniversary of its being granted independence by Gordon Brown within days of Labour coming to power in May 1997. Many of the participants were critical of the Bank \u2013 some sharply so. Adair Turner, former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, used a footballing metaphor to describe Threadneedle Street\u2019s record: a game of two halves with a strong performance in its first decade but dire since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007. The numbers do not lie. In terms of productivity and living standards, the last 10 years have been by far the worst in modern times. To extend Turner\u2019s metaphor, it has been relegation form and in the Premier League such bad results over so prolonged a period would mean the sack. When he was chancellor Alistair Darling fleetingly thought about firing Mervyn King, and relations between the Treasury and the Bank were at a particularly low ebb in 2008, but the story of the past 10 years has been of governors being granted more power rather than being shown the door. So whereas in the first 10 years after independence the Bank was essentially a monetary policy institute that spent its time tweaking interest rates to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target, it now also takes on financial responsibility. Threadneedle Street has two powerful committees: a monetary policy committee that has been using interest rates and quantitative easing to try to get the right balance of growth and inflation; and a financial policy committee that has the power to rein in bank lending if it thinks there is a risk of the City repeating the mistakes that led to the crisis of 2008. But although the Bank has become more powerful it has also become more vulnerable. The tools used to manage the economy \u2013 ultra low interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 have not led to a sustainable recovery. Rather, they have led to booming asset prices and excessively strong credit growth. In recent months, the Bank has been publicly voicing concerns about the 10% annual increase in unsecured borrowing but this is, to be frank, a bit rich. Credit is growing fast because 0.25% interest rates, QE and inducements to the commercial banks to lend have made borrowing easy and cheap. Put simply, the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee is now trying to mop up the problems caused by the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. To make matters worse, the Bank\u2019s decisions have helped some sections of the population more than others. Soaring asset prices have been great for property owners but terrible for young people with dreams of getting a foot on the housing ladder. As Andrew Tyrie, the former chairman of the Commons Treasury select committee, put it at last week\u2019s conference, many people have no memory of the years when inflation was routinely high but they are fully aware of the distributional consequences of the policies that have been used to fight deflation. Clearly, there are other reasons for Britain\u2019s housing crisis. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, routinely (and rightly) states that Threadneedle Street does not build a single house. Yet the fact that the Bank can influence the demand for property but not its supply suggests that the current structure of independence is not working properly. Housing policy is highly political, which is why Brown is suggesting the creation of a strategic oversight body \u2013 involving the chancellor and the governor \u2013 to look at financial policy. Carney was pretty sniffy about this idea, but Brown has a point when he says such a system would provide the Bank with some much-needed political cover by ensuring that ministers could not walk away from their responsibilities. That said, the idea that the Bank can be de-politicised is for the birds \u2013 and always was, because giving technocrats the power to set interest rates is in itself a political decision. The fact that the way the Bank operated was relatively uncontroversial in the first 10 years after independence is neither here nor there. What is true is that today\u2019s central banks have become more overtly political. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, regularly lectures eurozone governments on the need for structural reform. Brown bridled at the way King called on his government to take action to reduce the budget deficit during the financial crisis. And, of course, the Bank of England courted controversy with its warnings of the potential economic consequences of both Scottish independence and Brexit. Central banks have become more political as their performance has got worse and therein lies the danger for them. To take one obvious example, the Bank of England is currently gearing up to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, with strong hints that the decision will come at the next meeting of the MPC in early November. The thinking behind the move is that ever-decreasing unemployment will lead to higher inflation unless policy is tightened now. But there is not a lot of evidence of a looming wage-price spiral and unless one starts to develop, the annual inflation rate should start coming down over the next few months as last year\u2019s drop in the value of the pound ceases to have an impact on import prices. At no time in the past 20 years has the Bank raised interest rates when the economy is as weak as it currently is, so the dangers of the MPC getting it wrong are obvious. Now, no politician is going to strip the Bank of England of its independence because it makes the wrong call on interest rates, especially since that decision could swiftly be reversed. But here\u2019s the position. Central banks failed to spot the last crisis coming, assuming wrongly that excessive credit growth didn\u2019t matter because inflation was low. The tools banks deployed to deal with the crisis of a decade ago have boosted asset prices but not the real spending power of ordinary citizens. Household debt is rising and the whiff of Groundhog Day is unmistakable. All this at a time when voters cut elites far less slack than they once did. So imagine the worst happens and there is another crash. At the very least, central banks will be forced to come up with some new ways of stimulating their economies. Ideas that are currently frowned upon \u2013 targeted QE or straight cash payments to voters \u2013 will become mainstream. Central bank infallibility was always something of a myth. Much of the decline in inflation in the 1990s and early 2000s was due to globalisation rather than the brilliance of central bankers. The crisis has exposed that myth. It probably wouldn\u2019t take that much for politicians to decide to take back control. In footballing parlance, one more heavy defeat would do it.",

      "bodyText": "Few opinion polls that claim to detect a shift in public attitudes merit the ubiquitous label \u201clandmark research\u201d, but here\u2019s one that does. The Legatum Institute, a thinktank, and Populus have found levels of support for nationalising large parts of the economy that would have been hard to believe a few years ago. The big four industries in the sights of Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell should all return to public ownership, according to a strong majority of respondents. Water topped the poll (83%), followed by electricity (77%), gas (77%) and the railways (76%). Nationalisation fever also appears to be infectious. Royal Bank of Scotland, you might assume, is not a powerful advert for the delights of state ownership but the country is apparently evenly split on whether all banks should be nationalised. There was even 27% support for nationalising airlines, as if the budget airline revolution never happened. Dig deeper into the figures and you will see a remarkable convergence of opinion across age groups for most sectors. This is not a generational phenomenon. Some 78% of 55-64-year-olds, who are old enough to remember the days of British Rail (unloved at the time), support public ownership of train companies. When the winds have shifted this far, it\u2019s no wonder that prime minister Theresa May felt the need last week to rally to the defence of free markets as the \u201conly sustainable means of raising the living standards of everyone in a country\u201d. She can keep singing the same line, but the public seems to want to try something different. The Legatum/Populus research did not seek to explain why public opinion is currently so pro-nationalisation, but a few reasons are easy to guess. First, almost a decade after the financial crisis, real incomes in the UK are still being squeezed, so an appeal to the power of capitalism to improve living standards feels limp. The market has not delivered lower housing costs for generation rent, for example. Second, support for nationalisation seems to go hand-in-hand with a general collapse in trust in business. This statement gained the strongest support in another part of the polling: the pay of senior executives should be capped. Executives have brought that on themselves. Most of the working population never earn a bonus but quoted companies run \u201cremuneration\u201d schemes that make it almost impossible for a top executive not to get one. Sir Richard Lambert, former editor of the Financial Times and former director general of the CBI, said in 2010 that \u201cit is difficult to persuade the public that profits are no more than the necessary lifeblood of a successful business if they see a small cohort at the top reaping such large rewards\u201d. His speech made a splash at the time but seems to have had zero impact on executive pay. Third, the utilities and the train companies are in the firing line because the supposed benefits of privatisation seem so feeble. Water companies do not compete with each other and, for those that have been taken private, opaque financial structures make it impossible for outsiders to follow the fancy financial engineering and sums extracted by the owners. The energy companies regard a 5% profit margin as a birthright whereas supermarkets, which compete intensely, survive on half that level. And, while privatisation may have produced a surge in journeys by rail, more demand has not led to lower prices. The extraordinary part of this pro-nationalisation shift, however, is that Corbyn and McDonnell have barely bothered to explain how they would pay for the assets, or how they would run them better. If a company were contemplating a series of takeovers worth \u00a3200bn-plus, the shareholders would want to know the details. The prime minister, if she\u2019s serious about defending capitalism, might want to push that argument. She could also try rewriting the regulatory system for the utilities to ensure consumers get a better deal. You\u2019d probably start with water \u2013 it\u2019s hard to mess up and current owners enjoy a life of almost risk-free luxury. Good news for generation rent For the first time in eight years, house prices are falling in London. The annual decline, according to the Nationwide, is modest at 0.6% and not being replicated elsewhere in the country. But where the capital leads, the rest of Britain tends to follow and with the Bank of England signalling an increase in interest rates in November, a further easing of property prices looks inevitable. Such is the enduring love affair of Brits with bricks and mortar, this will no doubt be seen as national tragedy. It isn\u2019t. For years, house prices have been supported artificially by ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. The upshot has been that those who own property have been the lucky and undeserved beneficiaries of a boom in asset prices, while those who don\u2019t own property have seen their dream of getting their home disappear further and further into the distance. Booms sometimes end when interest rates go up sharply, as was the case in the late 1980s, when official borrowing costs doubled to 15% and unemployment hit 3 million. On other occasions, as now, they peter out when house prices become unaffordable to new buyers even when mortgage rates and the jobless rate are low. This is the latter sort of market. In London, the house-price-to-earnings ratio for a first-time buyer \u2013 even assuming they can find the deposit \u2013 is running at around 10, an absurdly high multiple. You don\u2019t need to be a financial genius to see why the upward trend in home ownership stretching back a century has gone into reverse. Rising house prices have been good for the buy-to-let landlords of the baby boomer generation: they are terrible for the millennials of generation rent. There are only two ways in which property can become more affordable: incomes have to rise or prices have to fall. There is precious little sign that wage inflation is picking up, so that means anyone seeking to sell a house in London has to be more realistic about the asking price. That, unambiguously, is a good thing. Uber boss faces hot seat The streets of London are paved with gold for Uber, so new boss Dara Khosrowshahi will be keen to get the app\u2019s licence to operate in the city back with a minimum of fuss. Khosrowshahi has some explaining to do at this week\u2019s sit-down with Transport for London boss Mike Brown, if he is to pull it off. The bare minimum Khosrowshahi should offer is a commitment to tackle TfL\u2019s list of concerns head on. This could include detailed plans for more thorough background checks on drivers and a system for the timely reporting of passengers\u2019 allegations of crime. But TfL will have had unspoken concerns about Uber that weren\u2019t included in its official statement, not least drivers\u2019 minimal employment rights and Uber\u2019s tax minimisation methods. If Uber\u2019s cars are to stay on the streets of London for good, Khosrowshahi should come bearing gifts designed to ensure that TfL will have no reason in the near future to take further punitive action that will reopen old wounds.",

For years, house prices have been supported artificially by ultra-low interest rates and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/quantitative-easing\" title=\"\">quantitative easing</a>. The upshot has been that those who own property have been the lucky and undeserved beneficiaries of a boom in asset prices, while those who don\u2019t own property have seen their dream of getting their home disappear further and further into the distance.</p> <p>Booms sometimes end when interest rates go up sharply, as was the case in the late 1980s, when official borrowing costs doubled to 15% and unemployment hit 3 million. On other occasions, as now, they peter out when house prices become unaffordable to new buyers even when mortgage rates and the jobless rate are low.</p> <p>This is the latter sort of market. In London, the house-price-to-earnings ratio for a first-time buyer \u2013 even assuming they can find the deposit \u2013 is running at around 10, an absurdly high multiple. You don\u2019t need to be a financial genius to see why the upward trend in home ownership stretching back a century has gone into reverse. Rising house prices have been good for the buy-to-let landlords of the baby boomer generation: they are terrible for the millennials of generation rent.</p> <p>There are only two ways in which property can become more affordable: incomes have to rise or prices have to fall. There is precious little sign that wage inflation is picking up, so that means anyone seeking to sell a house in London has to be more realistic about the asking price. That, unambiguously, is a good thing.</p> <h2>Uber boss faces hot seat</h2> <p>The streets of London are paved with gold for Uber, so new boss Dara Khosrowshahi will be keen to get the app\u2019s licence to operate in the city back with a minimum of fuss.</p> <p>Khosrowshahi has some explaining to do at this week\u2019s sit-down with Transport for London boss Mike Brown, if he is to pull it off.</p> <p>The bare minimum Khosrowshahi should offer is a commitment to tackle TfL\u2019s list of concerns head on.</p> <p>This could include detailed plans for more thorough background checks on drivers and a system for the timely reporting of passengers\u2019 allegations of crime.</p> <p>But TfL will have had unspoken concerns about Uber that weren\u2019t included in its official statement, not least drivers\u2019 minimal employment rights and Uber\u2019s tax minimisation&#xa0;methods.</p> <p>If Uber\u2019s cars are to stay on the streets of London for good, Khosrowshahi should come bearing gifts designed to ensure that TfL will have no reason in the near future to take further punitive action that will reopen old wounds\u200b.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lord Bhattacharyya of Moseley has been on speed-dial for prime ministers and captains of industry since Margaret Thatcher first sought his advice on how to reshape British industry with her ambitious privatisation programme. Bhattacharyya, the 77-year-old regius professor of manufacturing and chairman of Warwick university\u2019s Manufacturing Group (WMG), is also a business adviser and close confidant of Ratan Tata, former chairman and figurehead of Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate that owns Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), Tata Steel and Tetley Tea. The manufacturing guru helped broker the 2008 deal for Tata to buy JLR from Ford and was closely involved in the 2007 acquisition of Corus to form Tata Steel Europe. While the car company has roared on to success, the steel business has struggled through headwinds caused by cheap Chinese steel and high energy costs. A deal to merge the European steel operations of Tata with ThyssenKrupp, a German rival, was announced late last month after Tata removed a significant obstacle by offloading its UK retirement fund in August. The Indian group ditched the \u00a315bn British Steel pension scheme, inherited in the Corus deal, which threatened the survival of its UK business. Bhattacharyya believes the proposed tie-up will secure a brighter future for the steel business. \u201cIt will be better with ThyssenKrupp. Or else it will get isolated,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Britain, the energy costs are so high, so the penalty heavy industries have to pay has to be looked at [by government].\u201d The Remainer believes that erecting barriers to the free movement of skilled workers and imposing charges on goods flowing between Britain and the EU will inevitably have some impact. So, what does Britain need from the Brexit deal for industry to flourish? \u201cFree movement of skilled people and no tariffs,\u201d he says, without hesitation. The car industry is particularly sensitive to additional costs being slapped on the movement of parts and skilled workers. The carmakers are multinational operators that are used to transferring millions of components each week between their European operations without being hit with additional costs or border delays. \u201cIn my judgment, there will be a soft Brexit for car manufacturers,\u201d Bhattacharyya says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not in [the UK\u2019s EU partners\u2019] interests to crucify us and it\u2019s not in ours to crucify them. \u201cI\u2019m amused at what\u2019s happening to this country. Most of the rest of the world wants to develop trade relationships [with Europe], and we want to be out of it. We are a small country. The Japanese didn\u2019t come here because we are the bee\u2019s knees. They came here because we are a gateway to Europe.\u201d Will Tata continue to invest in Britain post-Brexit? \u201cYes, but they are not going to do it if the business case is not there,\u201d he warns. As a young graduate, Bhattacharyya arrived in the UK from India in 1961 to start a one-year apprenticeship at Lucas Industries, the now-defunct West Midlands motor and aerospace manufacturer, and later completed a PhD in engineering production. He set up WMG in 1980 \u2013 at Thatcher\u2019s request \u2013 with the aim of bridging the gap between academia and industry. He has since transformed it from one man in the university\u2019s engineering department into a business with 625 employees and an annual turnover of \u00a3200m. WMG has more than 3,000 people in education programmes and more than 250 doctoral students. It has carved out a lucrative niche providing research and development for industrial giants such as JLR, Bosch, Airbus, Nissan and BAE Systems. Its boffins develop new battery technology, cyber-security systems, lightweight materials for the auto and aerospace sectors, and surgical procedures for the healthcare industry, among other contracts. The \u00a3200m National Automotive Innovation Centre, funded largely by the car industry, is the latest jewel in WMG\u2019s crown. The striking glass and metal box will open at Warwick university next year and will house some of the finest minds from academia and industry, focused on advances in intelligent vehicles, electrification and lighter-weight materials. \u201cIf I went to the government for funding for it, I would spend my time in committees chasing money,\u201d he says. \u201cPrivate companies just want output.\u201d Bhattacharyya was knighted by Tony Blair\u2019s government in 2003 and elevated to the House of Lords in 2004. But he has friends and admirers on both sides of the aisle in Westminster and takes a pragmatic rather than tribal view of politics. \u201cI\u2019m a cross between intervention and independence,\u201d he says. \u201cI won\u2019t support everything relying on government \u2013 you can\u2019t have a long-term strategy based on that. It just won\u2019t work if there\u2019s no market pull. \u201cWhen Thatcher came in, the majority of British industry was nationalised. She came up with quite a simple strategy \u2013 how can we improve the productivity of these assets so they can be privatised?\u201d Having been a regular visitor to Japan and Germany, Bhattacharyya was ideally equipped to map out a manufacturing blueprint for the politicians in Britain. \u201cIn the 80s, the Japanese were beating the living daylights out of us,\u201d he recalls. \u201cFor example, the Japanese government and car companies got together and said, \u2018Let\u2019s see if we can do one side of the car in one stamping.\u2019 They did \u2013 this was in the early 1970s. At that time, [British car producers] didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d Britain\u2019s car industry went through some dark times in the 1980s and 1990s, but has come roaring back since \u2013 thanks largely to the success of JLR and investment from overseas giants such as Nissan, Toyota, Honda, BMW (Mini) and General Motors. Bhattacharyya is optimistic that the Midlands can benefit from this resurgence and once again become a powerhouse in automotive manufacturing. Along with the Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership, WMG is backing proposals to create a \u00a3120m National Battery Prototype Centre. If successful, the centre would be close to Coventry airport, and help produce electric batteries to take advantage of the forecast boom in demand for zero-emission vehicles. \u201cIt will make a huge difference to the battery industry,\u201d Bhattacharyya adds. \u201cAt the moment, it is mainly in the hands of the Koreans. We should make Coventry a smart motor city, like Munich, Stuttgart and Michigan.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Labour Leavers\u2019 claims that EU blocks state takeovers are rejected by experts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There is a group of Labour MPs who support a clean Brexit to break free from the shackles of a corporatist cartel that blocks state intervention. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has long been sympathetic to the Labour Brexit \u2013 or \u201cLexit\u201d \u2013 argument for the UK to leave the single market, if not the customs union, to escape a Brussels oligarchy that some believe has frowned on efforts by left-leaning governments to support individual industries or nationalise them to protect consumers\u2019 and workers\u2019 rights. The often-cited example is the nationalisation of Britain\u2019s banks, which was clearly needed after the 2008 financial crisis and yet had to be negotiated with the EU and renewed on several occasions. Unhappy with the continued state ownership of RBS, Brussels insisted on parts being sold off. A Labour government that wants to nationalise the water, energy and rail industries would spend most of its time in Brussels defending these actions and most likely having them refused. Better to get out and gain complete autonomy. Labour Leave backer Kelvin Hopkins, arguing against Labour policy and his leader\u2019s official position in favour of staying close to the single market, has called Brexit a \u201cnecessary condition for a left government to be able to do what I think a left government should do\u201d, which is to put the state back in the driving seat of economic recovery. But a legal assessment of Labour\u2019s 26 specific economic proposals by Andrea Biondi, director of the Centre of European Law at King\u2019s College London, found that the effect of remaining inside the EU \u201cwould likely be negligible\u201d. Writing with Andy Tarrant, a former Labour adviser on Europe, in the quarterly social democratic journal Renewal, he said: \u201cParticular concern has been expressed by supporters of \u2018Lexit\u2019 concerning state aid rules preventing those parts of the Labour\u2019s current programme which favour nationalisation. \u201cThis is not the case; nor would Lexit in any event be a mechanism for avoiding state aid laws, which are requirements of World Trade Organisation membership and form part of the EU\u2019s negotiating brief for any trade agreement with the UK.\u201d The EU has a policy that prevents a national railway monopoly, but this is to make sure a pan-European freight network thrives, which is something Labour supporters would probably back. Most European countries have a nationalised railway system. French president Emmanuel Macron recently nationalised a shipyard jointly owned with an Italian rival to prevent the domestic firm losing control. He was able to press ahead with his protectionist measure under Maastricht and Lisbon Treaty rules that leave room for policy objectives for which state aid can be considered compatible. Talk to EU officials and they are bewildered at the notion the EU is a one-size fits all club when there are many more social democratic, statist members than the UK. The European commission has estimated that its history of exemptions shows that more than three-quarters of submissions for state aid have been waved through. Admittedly, there is work to be done, while inside the EU deals with all applications to get around state aid rules on a case-by-case basis, but this should not be too onerous once the UK has left the union and employed the legion of trade negotiators it will need just to deal with the trade issues and complaints currently dealt with by Brussels. Nigel Driffield, professor of international business at Warwick Business School, says Brexiters on the right and left underestimate the volume of work and specialist trade negotiators that will be needed once the UK moves out from under Brussels\u2019 umbrella.\u201cThe sheer number of civil servants needed to conduct trade policy is huge. In the 1970s something like 40% of all economics graduates were hoovered up by Whitehall to be sector specialists.\u201d Driffield says the temptation to rescue dying industries is another minefield. \u201cIt\u2019s completely insane to think the UK can subsidise industries and sell those goods abroad without the EU or anywhere else accusing us of dumping. The minute you rescue a steel works you are probably in breach of any trade deal.\u201d If Labour wants to increase UK exports, the tools are already available. In his book Failure to Adjust, Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says the left\u2019s problems with globalisation are misplaced. Writing about the US, he says: \u201cThe problem has been the domestic political response to globalisation, which in too many ways has been deeply irresponsible. A central task of any government is to provide the tools to help people adjust and succeed in the face of economic change. However, the story of the last half-century has been the failure by governments to ease that adjustment.\u201d The failure of successive administrations to find ways to cushion those blows explains why US president Donald Trump\u2019s anti-trade stance proved so alluring to voters. And the same analysis could apply to the UK, where insecure employment, low wages and rising levels of inequality are the source of anger, and not EU membership.",

      "body": "<p>There is <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/08/what-next-lexit-left-wing-eurosceptics-and-their-vision-brexit?page=9&amp;qt-trending=1\">a group of Labour MPs</a> who support a clean Brexit to break free from the shackles of a corporatist cartel that blocks state intervention.</p> <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has long been sympathetic to the Labour Brexit \u2013 or \u201cLexit\u201d \u2013 argument for the UK to leave the single market, if not the customs union, to escape a Brussels oligarchy that some believe has frowned on efforts by left-leaning governments to support individual industries or nationalise them to protect consumers\u2019 and workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>The often-cited example is the nationalisation of Britain\u2019s banks, which was clearly needed after the 2008 financial crisis and yet had to be negotiated with the EU and renewed on several occasions. Unhappy with the continued state ownership of RBS, Brussels insisted on parts being sold off.</p> <p>A Labour government that wants to nationalise the water, energy and rail industries would spend most of its time in Brussels defending these actions and most likely having them refused. Better to get out and gain complete autonomy.</p> <p>Labour Leave backer Kelvin Hopkins, arguing against Labour policy and his leader\u2019s official position in favour of staying close to the single market, has called Brexit a \u201cnecessary condition for a left government to be able to do what I think a left government should do\u201d, which is to put the state back in the driving seat of economic recovery.</p> <p>But a legal assessment of Labour\u2019s 26 specific economic proposals by Andrea Biondi, director of the Centre of European Law at King\u2019s College London, found that the effect of remaining inside the EU \u201cwould likely be negligible\u201d. Writing with Andy Tarrant, a former Labour adviser on Europe, in the quarterly social democratic journal <em>Renewal</em>, he said: \u201cParticular concern has been expressed by supporters of \u2018Lexit\u2019 concerning state aid rules preventing those parts of the Labour\u2019s current programme which favour nationalisation.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not the case; nor would Lexit in any event be a mechanism for avoiding state aid laws, which are requirements of World Trade Organisation membership and form part of the EU\u2019s negotiating brief for any trade agreement with the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The EU has a policy that prevents a national railway monopoly, but this is to make sure a pan-European freight network thrives, which is something Labour supporters would probably back. Most European countries have a nationalised railway system.</p> <p>French president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/27/france-nationalises-strategic-shipyard-emmanuel-macron\">Emmanuel Macron recently nationalised a shipyard</a> jointly owned with an Italian rival to prevent the domestic firm losing control. He was able to press ahead with his protectionist measure under Maastricht and Lisbon Treaty rules that leave room for policy objectives for which state aid can be considered compatible.</p> <p>Talk to EU officials and they are bewildered at the notion the EU is a one-size fits all club when there are many more social democratic, statist members than the UK. The European commission has estimated that its history of exemptions shows that more than three-quarters of submissions for state aid have been waved through.</p> <p>Admittedly, there is work to be done, while inside the EU deals with all applications to get around state aid rules on a case-by-case basis, but this should not be too onerous once the UK has left the union and employed the legion of trade negotiators it will need just to deal with the trade issues and complaints currently dealt with by Brussels.</p> <p>Nigel Driffield, professor of international business at Warwick Business School, says Brexiters on the right and left underestimate the volume of work and specialist trade negotiators that will be needed once the UK moves out from under Brussels\u2019 umbrella.\u201cThe sheer number of civil servants needed to conduct trade policy is huge. In the 1970s something like 40% of all economics graduates were hoovered up by Whitehall to be sector specialists.\u201d</p> <p>Driffield says the temptation to rescue dying industries is another minefield.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely insane to think the UK can subsidise industries and sell those goods abroad without the EU or anywhere else accusing us of dumping. The minute you rescue a steel works you are probably in breach of any trade deal.\u201d</p> <p>If Labour wants to increase UK exports, the tools are already available. In his book <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/book/failure-adjust\">Failure to Adjust</a>, Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says the left\u2019s problems with globalisation are misplaced. Writing about the US, he says: \u201cThe problem has been the domestic political response to globalisation, which in too many ways has been deeply irresponsible. A central task of any government is to provide the tools to help people adjust and succeed in the face of economic change. However, the story of the last half-century has been the failure by governments to ease that adjustment.\u201d</p> <p>The failure of successive administrations to find ways to cushion those blows explains why US president Donald Trump\u2019s anti-trade stance proved so alluring to voters. And the same analysis could apply to the UK, where insecure employment, low wages and rising levels of inequality are the source of anger, and not EU membership.</p>",
