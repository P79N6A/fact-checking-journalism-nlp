      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s big four banks could act on their stated ambition to help achieve a 2C warming target simply by giving no new loans to coal projects, analysis by financial activists Market Forces reveals. Such a move \u2013 including a halt to refinancing existing loans \u2013 would virtually empty the banks\u2019 loan book of the $8bn they are lending to coal in just five years. All four big banks have made statements supporting the 2C warming target. ANZ\u2019s statement acknowledged worries that lending to fossil fuels was in conflict with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Westpac went so far as to say it would take \u201cconcrete action to ensure our lending and investing activities support an economy that limits global warming to less than two degrees\u201d. Analysts at Market Forces examined what the banks could do to put those sentiments into practice. The group has kept a database of loans to fossil fuel projects since 2008, which now contains 475 deals. Of those loans, 142 are to coal projects. If all the current loans to Australian coal companies were simply allowed to run their course, all but one would expire by 2021. The exception is a loan the group says Commonwealth Bank has given to one of the country\u2019s largest coal power stations \u2013 Loy Yang B in Victoria \u2013 which runs until 2026. \u201cUrgent action is not just necessary but possible, as financial flows can change very quickly,\u201d said Julien Vincent, the chief executive of Market Forces. He said the group was calling on banks to remove coal from their loan books by 2021. \u201cThe first test for ANZ will be next month, as their loan to Hazelwood power station is due to expire,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this deal gets renewed or extended it would be hard to take ANZ seriously on climate change.\u201d Vincent said the expiry dates for about 10% of the loans in the database were unknown, so it was possible there was an outlier that would last beyond 2021. International loans were not included in the analysis but they amounted only to about 2.5% of the loan books. As commodity prices have plummeted and demand for coal \u2013 particularly Australian coal \u2013 has dropped, many of the projects the banks have on their books are not performing well. Both ANZ and Westpac have written down the value of their loan book. \u201cThe banks should be as keen as the community to get their exposure to coal down to zero as soon as possible,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cNot only do they have an imperative to prove they weren\u2019t just green-washing when they committed to supporting the 2C global warming limit agreed in Paris but many coal deals are now turning sour, financially impacting the banks.\u201d Among the loans in Market Forces\u2019 database are: ANZ lending $158m to Hazelwood power station in June 2014, just three months after the mine fire. That loan is due to mature in June 2016. Adani\u2019s Abbot Point coal port expansion has been financed to the tune of $540m by the Commonwealth Bank and $250m by Westpac. The last of those loans will expire in November 2020. The analysis does not include exposure to coal or other fossil fuels in the form of bonds or in their investment portfolios. Earlier in the year Market Forces showed that, despite the banks\u2019 statements on climate change, their business was carrying on as usual. In 2015, the group estimated, banks had lent $5.5bn to fossil fuel projects \u2013 a figure that was roughly normal for the past eight years. Each of the banks responded to Guardian Australia by emphasising their increased lending to renewable energy, but didn\u2019t comment on whether they would reduce lending to coal. Their full statements are reproduced below. An ANZ spokesman said: We acknowledge that climate change is a shared challenge for governments, business and the community, and we are taking action to support our customers\u2019 transition to a low carbon economy. In 2015 we achieved our long-term target ahead of schedule to increase our lending to lower-carbon gas and renewable power generation. Renewables and gas currently account for 80.4% of this business (project financed power generation). We have committed to fund and facilitate $10 billion over the next five years to support low carbon activity, and we have new and strengthened rules on coal lending. A Westpac spokeswoman said: As a major financial institution Westpac recognises we have an important role to play in supporting the transition to a two-degree economy. Westpac regularly reviews its position and policies in relation to lending. When assessing projects, we proactively work with customers to understand and manage environment, social and governance risks. Since 2011, we have increased the proportion of renewable energy financing from 45% to 61% of our total electricity generation portfolio. A Commonwealth Bank spokesman said: Commonwealth Bank plays a crucial role in enabling economic and social development in Australia by supporting jobs, growth, innovation and opportunities for people and businesses. As a major financial institution we invest in nearly every sector in the economy and we believe we need to take a balanced, measured and responsible approach as we support the transition to a low-carbon economy. In November 2015, we announced our updated Group Environment Policy, which states that there is a clear need to minimise and mitigate the impacts of climate change, and that international efforts to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius will require a transition from traditional economic models, and the world\u2019s current energy mix, to low carbon and renewable alternatives. A whole-of-institution response to aligning a business with the two degree Celsius target requires considerable research and policy development and fundamental changes to business as usual. We are taking an incremental and iterative approach and will evolve our policies and commitments as we develop better understanding of domestic and global policy settings and what they mean for the business. An NAB spokeswoman said: We believe NAB has a role to play in transitioning to a low carbon economy, which is why we have committed to investing $18 billion over the next 7 years to help with that transition in a considered and balanced manner. Over the last nine years we have arranged more than $2 billion worth of loans for renewable energy projects, which makes NAB the leading project finance arranger by market share to the Australian renewable energy sector. Our lending decisions, including decisions about renewal of existing finance, incorporate many considerations - including consideration of Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) risks associated with particular sectors - as part of our credit risk assessment and due diligence processes. As of 31 March 2016, the power generation sector comprised approximately 0.5 per cent of our total Group Exposure at Default (EAD). Of this, 43.5 per cent was from renewable energy.",

      "bodyText": "Administrators are hoping to finalise a rescue deal for BHS by the end of this week after securing four offers for the business on Tuesday. MPs are preparing to call Darren Topp, the current boss of BHS, to give evidence to a parliamentary inquiry next month into the retail chain\u2019s collapse. Topp, who took over the business after it was bought for \u00a31 from Topshop owner Sir Philip Green a year ago, will stand before a joint hearing of the work and pensions select committee and the business, innovation and skills committee on 8 June. Bidders for the 164-store chain are understood to include Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day and Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, as well as a \u201cEuropean retail group\u201d. The other bidder is a consortium made up of Matalan founder John Hargreaves and Turkish entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu, who rescued the value fashion retailer Select in 2008. Administrators are understood to be considering only bids for the entire business including the brand, in the hope of saving as many jobs as possible. That stipulation is understood to have prompted Hargreaves and Mahiroglu to form a last-minute bid consortium. A number of other bidders, thought to include Dominic Chappell, the head of BHS\u2019s former owner Retail Acquisitions, Yousuf Bhailok, a Preston-based property entrepreneur, and a group led by Co-operative Group chairman Allan Leighton, have dropped out. BHS went into administration at the end of last month, putting 11,000 high street jobs at risk. The 88-year-old retailer failed little more than a year after Green sold it to a little-known collection of financiers, lawyers and accountants, led by Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt at least twice. With an estimated fortune of \u00a3500m, Hargreaves, the son of a Liverpool dock labourer, has the financial clout to do a deal, although Matalan\u2019s profits have suffered in recent years. A less prominent figure, Mahiroglu has returned Select, which sells largely to 18-35-year-old women, to profit, with sales up more than 20% last year to \u00a386.4m. Select, which recently signed a multi-million-pound sponsorship deal with ITV reality show The Only Way Is Essex, benefits from the family\u2019s ownership of clothing factories in places such as Turkey and Romania, a supply line that could prove useful if they win control. The fall of BHS, which still has a \u00a3571m hole in its pension fund, is now the subject of inquiries including an Insolvency Service investigation launched by the business secretary, Sajid Javid, and the hearings being held by the two select committees. MPs are expected to summon lawyers, accountants and financial firms who advised companies on both sides of the transaction. Anthony Gutman, a senior Goldman Sachs banker who is reported to have provided informal advice to Green and his lawyers Linklaters, will give evidence alongside Retail Acquisitions advisors from legal firm Olswang and accountants Grant Thornton.",

      "bodyText": "Expectations were low and the Competition and Markets Authority barely met them. If that sounds cruel, consider the painful moment at the end of the mid-morning press conference when Alasdair Smith, chair of the retail banking investigation, was asked to say who apart from the British Bankers\u2019 Association lobby group welcomed the report. Smith mentioned Citizens Advice and then paused. The silence was broken only by a colleague\u2019s assertion that positive responses were still, apparently, \u201crolling in\u201d. Really? To be fair to Smith, the CMA was never going to be allowed to host a fireworks display. The chief grumble from the \u201cchallenger\u201d banks \u2013 the likes of Metro Bank \u2013 is that their competitive ambitions are constrained by the need to hold disproportionate amounts of capital. But the little ol\u2019 CMA can\u2019t tread on the Bank of England\u2019s territory. Equally, the tempting option of breaking up the \u201cbig four\u201d lenders would have carried political risks. Royal Bank of Scotland, currently making the job of spinning off 600 branches resemble the labours of Hercules, has destroyed appetite for structural upheaval. As for abolishing free-if-in-credit banking \u2013 and thus exposing the hidden costs to consumers of current accounts \u2013 the politicians know there are no votes in the idea. Thus the CMA, while describing competitive pressures as weak, produced a hotchpotch of remedies that amount to nudges, prompts and tweaks. There will be a \u201ccap\u201d on charges for unarranged overdrafts but each bank can set its own rate. The CMA wants to push better comparison websites to encourage customers to switch accounts; banks will be obliged to adopt the necessary open-data software. And, in the small-business market, tech-minded whizzkids will be offered a prize to invent comparison tools. That was about it. The hard \u2013 and depressing \u2013 reality about competition in the banking market is that the pivotal moment was the day in September 2008, in the middle of crisis, that the Labour government allowed Lloyds TSB to buy HBOS to prevent an even bigger banking meltdown. A new market leader was created and competition objections were ignored. Some Labour politicians plead in their defence that they expected the Lloyds/HBOS merger to be unwound by a future competition watchdog. That hasn\u2019t happened this time, and now probably never will. One of these decades, the FinTech revolution, already seen in the rise of peer-to-peer lending, may succeed in injecting some real competition by changing the definition of what it means to be a bank. Until then, though, we\u2019re stuck with the CMA\u2019s attempt to make the current lot \u201cwork harder for customers\u201d while hitting them with a feather. Vodafone\u2019s organic approach finally pays dividends Vittorio Colao, Vodafone\u2019s chief executive, has been talking for ages about reaching a turning point and here it is: the first increase in \u201corganic\u201d revenues and top-line profits since 2008. It hasn\u2019t come cheaply. Vodafone has spent \u00a319bn in the past two years, including a necessary extra \u00a37bn under \u201cProject Spring\u201d to get its 4G and data capabilities up to competitive strength. If investors worried that heavy spending would become permanent \u2013 and that Project Summer would follow \u2013 there is no evidence to suggest so. The statistics for growth in broadband, mobile data, business customers and emerging markets all look healthy. The only blemish was a botched billing system in the UK. The wider picture is that Vodafone\u2019s dividend, costing \u00a33bn-a-year, looks more affordable that at any time since the $130bn (\u00a384bn) sale of the Verizon Wireless stake in 2014, which was followed by a mammoth return of cash to shareholders. Vodafone is a duller company these days \u2013 at least until the deal-making starts afresh. But its profit predictions are generally accurate and the dividend yield is 5%. Hard to quibble with that. Mike Ashley\u2019s chopper offer is fine for travel agents but not MPs Roll up, roll up, who wants a ride in Mike Ashley\u2019s helicopter? Unfortunately, this offer is available only to members of the Commons select committee on business, innovation and skills. The Sports Direct founder wants its MPs to visit him at the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse \u2013 travelling in his chopper or their charabanc, or whatever \u2013 and then he will graciously appear in front of the committee the next day in Westminster. If they value the dignity of their office, the MPs\u2019 reply to Ashley\u2019s invitation should be a firm no. It\u2019s their inquiry into working practices at Sports Direct and witnesses can\u2019t be allowed to attach conditions to their appearance. Hear from Ashley in Westminster and then decide if a trip to Derbyshire would be useful. Remember, dear MPs, you\u2019re running a parliamentary inquiry, not a travel agency.",

    "webTitle": "UK inflation down as air fares fall", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK inflation fell unexpectedly in April, with lower air fares, clothes and secondhand car prices triggering the first drop in seven months. Britain\u2019s main measure of inflation, the consumer prices index, fell from 0.5% in March to 0.3% last month, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had forecast no change at 0.5%. The chancellor\u2019s office seized upon the drop in inflation as a sign UK households were better off within the European Union. A spokeswoman for the Treasury said: \u201cToday\u2019s inflation figure continues the trend we\u2019ve seen over the past year. Pay is growing faster than prices, boosting families\u2019 spending power. \u201cIt is clear Britain would be poorer outside the EU. To avoid putting our economic progress at risk we must continue with the plan that is building resilience and delivering rising living standards across Britain.\u201d However, the TUC said low inflation was a sign of weakness in the UK economy. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s continuing low inflation is a sign that the economy still lacks the demand needed to get back to full strength. Wage growth remains too weak and we do not have the level of public investment needed to secure stronger growth. \u201cWith the UK economy slowing down, the government cannot continue to stand by. We need investment in skills, infrastructure and public services to promote growth for the long term.\u201d Inflation has been below 1% since December 2014, providing respite for UK households as prices rise at a slower rate than pay following six years of real wage falls during the financial crisis. Despite record levels of employment, wage growth has not picked up as much as Bank of England policymakers and other economists thought. Regular pay growth, excluding bonuses, was 2.2% in the three months to February compared with the same period a year earlier. It was 1.8% including bonuses. CPI inflation had been steadily rising from a record low level of -0.1% in September. The drop in annual inflation in April was partly explained by the earlier timing of Easter, which fell in March this year making travel more expensive that month. Air fares fell 14.2% between March and April this year, compared with a 4.5% rise between the same two months last year. The price of secondhand cars also fell between March and April this year, but rose over the same period in 2015. The cost of clothing and footwear fell 0.4%, compared with a 0.9% rise between the two months last year. The price of women\u2019s coats and jackets drove much of the fall in clothing costs, the ONS said. Elizabeth Martins, economist at HSBC, said the fall in clothing prices was a surprise, and could be weather related or down to weaker consumer demand. \u201cIf it is weather related, and hence temporary, then we may get an unseasonably high reading for clothing inflation in May,\u201d she said. Lower gas bills and social housing rent costs also contributed to the drop in inflation in April. A change in government policy last year stated that from April 2016, rent would fall by 1% for the next four years. Core inflation \u2013 stripping out volatile energy and food prices \u2013 was also weaker than expected at 1.2%, down from 1.5% in March. Economists had forecast 1.4%. Economists said inflation was likely to stay low in the coming months, despite a weaker pound and a recent pickup in oil prices that should feed through to the petrol pump. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cThis is unlikely to be enough to cause any tangible movement in the headline rate of inflation. \u201cAs such, we are likely to see inflation remain close to current rates until the latter part of the year, when the base effects associated with last winter\u2019s collapse in the oil price will begin to kick in and finally drag the CPI measure above 1%.\u201d The British Chambers of Commerce said weak inflation strengthened the case for the Bank of England to keep UK interest rates low. Rates have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, warned last week that a vote to leave the EU in next month\u2019s referendum could stoke inflation, trigger a sharp fall in the pound and push the UK back into recession.",

      "bodyText": "Further rises in the oil price gave some support to stock markets in early trading, but with crude falling back during the course of the day, and renewed talk of US rate rises after stronger than expected data, the initial gains soon went into reverse. A late rally in oil - Brent crude is now up 0.98% at $49.45 a barrel having fallen as low as $48.57 - has seen shares come off their worst levels, but it was still another unpredictable day for investors. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 16.37 points or 0.27% at 6167.77 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.63% to 9890.19 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.34% lower at 4297.57 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.34% to 17,498.88 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.19% at 8698.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.95% to 626.37 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 89 points or 0.5%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Adding to the renewed expectation of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike next month with further rises to come: Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Jana Kasperkevic to sum up the comments: Speaking at a POLITICO event this afternoon, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and San Francisco Fed president John Williams would not rule out a June interest rate hike. June meeting \u201ccertainly could be\u201d a meeting where action is taken, said Lockhart. He pointed out that every meeting is live. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take it off the table,\u201d he said of a June interest rate hike, adding that \u201cmarkets are more pessimistic than I am\u201d. Williams echoed that all meetings are live, adding that more data will be released before the June meeting. Both Williams and Lockhart, who are not voting members of Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee, said there is a possibility of two to three rate hikes this year. As for the Brexit vote, which takes place about a week after Fed\u2019s next meeting, the Fed will have to determine if it could have an impact on the US economy, said Lockhart. Williams pointed out that if there is too much uncertainty in mid-June, the Fed does meet again six weeks later and could delay raising interest rates until then. Dennis Lockhart and John C. Williams from the US Federal Reserve are currently discussing the US economy at a Politico event which you can watch here. Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has said the IMF needs a political deal on Greek debt. The latest US data suggests a rate rise is likely before long, according to Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research. He said: The US economy is rebounding nicely in the second quarter. Most recent numbers for April have even exceeded our above-consensus expectations... Federal Reserve officials across the board \u2013 i.e. hawks and doves \u2013 have highlighted repeatedly that every FOMC meeting is a live meeting and that the policy decision is completely data dependent. We understand that one (or even two) swallow(s) don\u2019t make a summer. But the latest round of data was as good as it gets. Second quarter 2016 GDP growth is now tracking at close to 3%, and the first quarter 2016 figure is bound to be revised up to 1% from the initially reported 0.5%. With inflation moving higher and financial markets much calmer, we will soon find out whether the emphasis of the data-dependency is more than a lip service. We continue to expect two to three rate hikes for this year, and are thus at odds with financial markets, which have barely priced in a single hike in 2016. Back with Greece, and ahead of the latest weekend vote in the country\u2019s parliament on the latest reform proposals and next week\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, the International Monetary Fund reportedly wants its debt to be suspended until 2040. Debt relief is one of the key issues the country\u2019s creditors have to resolve, and there have been concerns that the IMF would withdraw from the process if there was no satisfactory agreement. But the Wall Street Journal is now reporting: The International Monetary Fund is pressing the eurozone to let Greece skip paying interest or principal on bailout loans until 2040, say officials familiar with the talks. The IMF wants the loans to Greece to fall due gradually in the following decades, and as late as 2080, according to the IMF\u2019s proposal\u2014a demand that goes far beyond what Greece\u2019s European creditors, particularly Germany, have said they are willing to do to help Greece regain its financial health. Greece\u2019s interest rate on eurozone loans would be fixed for 30 to 40 years at its current average level of 1.5%, with all interest payments postponed until loans start falling due, under the IMF proposal. Greece wants to settle the debt issue at Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup gathering, according to Reuters, with a government spokeswoman quoted as saying the IMF\u2019s views on debt relief were \u201calways in the right direction.\u201d Reuters also quotes a senior EU official expressing confidence the IMF will be part of the Greek reform review, adding that eurozone ministers are working on a debt deal that would satisfy both the eurozone and the IMF\u2019s requirements. But that will not be so easy. As the Wall Street Journal reports: The IMF is also at odds with eurozone authorities and Greece\u2019s government over how to ensure Athens hits its budget targets. But Greece is expected to pass the bulk of the fiscal measures creditors want from it by next week. The crucial fight is now among the creditors. \u201cGreece is basically out of the picture,\u201d says another European official. \u201cThis is a dialogue between the IMF and the countries that really want the IMF.\u201d The latest US data showing higher inflation and better than expected industrial production has added some impetus to the idea that the Federal Reserve may, after all, decide on a rate hike next month. And that has been enough to send US markets lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 74 points or 0.44% after Monday\u2019s gains, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are also lower. The weakness in the US has helped knock European markets lower, with the FTSE 100 now up just 8 points and Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both around 0.6% lower. The recent recovery in oil prices comes amid interruptions in supply from Canada, Nigeria and elsewhere, as analysts at Goldman Sachs pointed to a dramatic cut in stockpiles. But not everyone agrees. Ben Combes at independent economic group Llewellyn Consulting said: Weekly fluctuations in [US] stocks by 4 or 5 million barrels need to be viewed in perspective. A broader sweep of history reveals that US oil stocks have been rising since 2008, and sharply so over the past year or so. Stocks are at their highest since the 1980s. One week\u2019s data \u2013 e.g. last week\u2019s 3 mb draw, perhaps reflecting recent interruptions in Canada and Nigeria \u2013 risks missing something of potential strategic significance: the supply glut seems persistent. There are many potential reasons why stocks are trending upwards: weak final demand; stronger than expected supply; companies building inventories at \u2018low\u2019 prices in expectation of rising prices further out. But stocks seem unlikely to remain at such elevated levels indefinitely. The main reason for the oil price halving in 2014, and again in 2015, was the basic global imbalance of supply and final demand: supply was, in certain months, running as much as 2m barrels a day in excess of final demand (the gap being global stock building). Such excess supply suggested that a rebalance, through the price mechanism, was inevitable. Many posit, not least given recent interruptions, that rebalancing has now run its course, and that prices stand to rise, perhaps markedly, hereafter. US stock levels, however, might well suggest otherwise. The process could be far from over. If the market is yet to rebalance fully, the implications for the price of oil seem clear: the market may not have yet reached its low. Moreover, any rise in price might encourage further stock building, delaying rebalancing, and resulting eventually in a larger price correction. To the extent that oil stocks continue to rise, the more the oil price stands eventually to fall. More US data, showing better than expected industrial production in April. Industrial output rose by 0.7% compared to forecasts of a 0.3% rise, with output from utilities bouncing back after a warmer than expected March. US factory output climbed 0.3%, in line with expectations, with good gains in machinery and car manufacturing. Could the US Federal Reserve take the plunge and raise interest rates at next month\u2019s meeting? Rob Carnell of Dutch bank ING reckons the odds of a June hike are growing, following today\u2019s jump in inflation. Such a hike would surprise the markets, though, as Carnell explains: Comments from Fed speakers over recent months have reiterated that June is a \u201clive\u201d month, and that two rate hikes look a reasonable prospect for 2016. But financial markets have been pricing in a far flatter curve for the Fed over the coming year. Today\u2019s inflation data is a clarion call for a market rethink on the Fed. In our view, the Fed has been waiting for the perfect mix of benign financial conditions, inflation heading in the right direction, and some evidence that real activity is picking up after a very soft first quarter. And although the latter condition is still debatable, decent retail sales data released last week certainly puts 2Q16 on a firmer footing as far as activity is concerned. This better run of activity data now needs to be maintained through to the June FOMC meeting, which is not by any means a given, But a June rate hike cannot be ruled out, and we will be looking at our house forecast for a 3Q16 hike as data continues to come in, to see if we need to bring this forward to June. David Morrison of City firm SpreadCo reckons the Fed will sit tight while the battle for the White House rages: According to the Fed funds futures there\u2019s just around a 4 percent chance of an increase in June. Nevertheless, there remains a view that the Fed could still raise rates twice this year. However, that would suggest a move in September which is dangerously close to the Presidential Election. It seems reasonable to assume that the Fed wouldn\u2019t want to shift rates in either direction before the election. If it did, then it runs the considerable danger of being labelled partisan \u2013 particularly as this is shaping up to be a particularly vicious contest. Today\u2019s inflation figures also include bad news for American workers. Real average hourly earnings actually shrank by 0.1%, once you adjust for the rising cost of living. That\u2019s because average earnings rose by 0.3% in April, which was more than wiped out by the 0.4% jump in the Consumer Price Index. Real weekly earnings rose by 0.2%, though -- because employees actually worked more hours than in March. This jump in US inflation is going to reignite talk about another hike in US interest rates.... Breaking: Prices in America have risen at their fastest rate in three years. The latest US inflation data, just released, show that consumer prices rose by 0.4% during April alone - the biggest one-month gain since February 2013. That pushed the annual inflation rate up to 1.1%, from 0.9% \u2013 much faster than the UK\u2019s lacklustre 0.3%. Importantly, core inflation (excluding energy and food) rose by 0.2% month-on-month, and was 2.1% higher on an annual basis. That\u2019s slightly higher than the Fed\u2019s target for headline inflation. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons the cost of living in the UK will remain subdued through this year: The assumption among many City economists is that inflation will rise steadily in the second half of the year, putting interest rate increases from the Bank of England back on the agenda. They expect an unwinding of the sharp fall in energy prices in late 2015 coupled with a rebound in activity once the threat of Brexit is out of the way to nudge the monetary policy committee into action. These forecasts should be taken with a pinch of salt. Inflation is low and the economy was weakening even before the government announced the date of the referendum in late February. There will probably be a bit of a bounce in the third quarter if, as seems likely, the decision on 23 June is to stay in the EU. But there is more chance of the economy stalling than there is of a boom. That will keep inflationary pressure in check and should make the Bank cautious about raising rates. Here\u2019s his analysis of today\u2019s figures: The pressure of smashing through the $50 per barrel mark for the first time this year has proved too much for the oil price. This morning\u2019s rally has fizzled out, and Brent crude is now trading at just $48.74 per barrel. Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank, reckons oil will have another charge higher soon, though: \u201cI expect prices to take a shot at $50. The outages in Canada and Nigeria alone are probably enough to leave the global oil market undersupplied at present.\u201d Nigeria\u2019s oil production network has been hit by a series of militant attacks recently. Unions have called a general strike for Wednesday, in protest at gasoline price hikes, which could also hurt output. Falling inflation isn\u2019t good news for savers, who continue to press their noses against the windows of the Bank of England in the vain hope of seeing a rate rise. Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly, reckons there\u2019s little change of deposit rates rising anytime soon: With the run-up to the EU referendum contributing to increasing fears about the state of the global economy, the last thing we want is to be flirting with the term \u2018noflation\u2019 again. Indeed, this news reinforces the view that a rise in interest rates is not going to happen this year. Even though we have witnessed a rising oil price in recent months, the Bank of England\u2019s 2% inflation target seems a long way off just now and this will only make Mark Carney sit tight and make us wait yet again on interest rates. For those who want to grow their money over the long-term they should be considering stocks and shares ISAs as an alternative to the derisory saving rates on offer from the banks, although risk is attached. Here\u2019s our news story about the 9% jump in house prices in March: The pound has been hit by the news that Britain\u2019s inflation rate had fallen from 0.5% to just 0.3%. After a strong start to the day, sterling fell back to $1.448 when the unexpectedly weak consumer price data arrived. Nawaz Ali, UK currency strategist at Western Union Business Solutions, says the pound is suffering because UK inflation is stagnating with a disappointingly low report causing an immediate drop in the value of the Pound. Forecasts ahead of \u2018CPI Tuesday\u2019 ranged from about 0.7% down to 0.3%, so today\u2019s 0.3% UK inflation release is right at the bottom of this range. Whilst not a game-changer, this data will be a real blow for the hawkish members of the Bank of England favouring future interest rate hikes. That still leaves the pound up around one cent today, partly driven by a phone poll which showed the Remain campaign holding a 15 point lead. Core inflation, which strips out volatile measures such as energy and food, has also fallen - from 1.5% to 1.2%. That suggests that underlying price pressures are still subdued \u2013 which is frankly excellent news for consumers. This graph, from Berenberg bank, shows how the price of physical goods began falling back in 2014 (partly due to cheaper energy costs) Berenberg\u2019s Kallum Pickering explains: The large falls in the headline rate since 2014 are largely due to cheaper goods, which account for 52% of the weight in the headline index. Low inflation has helped boost real incomes during a time when nominal wage gains have been unusually soft relative to the level of unemployment in the economy. And given that household consumption has been growing faster than overall GDP, there is little evidence that low inflation has led households to postpone spending amid expectations of lower prices in the future. Whilst low inflation might give the inflation targeting Bank of England a headache, it is mostly a welcome boost for UK households and the economy overall. The Federation of Small Businesses and the British Chambers of Commerce have both issued statements urging the Bank of England to resist raising interest rates. BCC chief economist David Kern says: While the Bank of England\u2019s current monetary policy is conducive to maintaining stability, boosting business confidence will require much greater efforts on the part of the government to support growth at a time when the economy faces many headwinds. The TUC, which represents Britain\u2019s unionised workers, doesn\u2019t share the Treasury\u2019s happiness about the drop in inflation. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady argues: The UK\u2019s continuing low inflation is a sign that the economy still lacks the demand needed to get back to full strength. Wage growth remains too weak and we do not have the level of public investment needed to secure stronger growth. With the UK economy slowing down, the government cannot continue to stand by. We need investment in skills, infrastructure and public services to promote growth for the long term. Figures released last month showed that wage growth, including bonuses, fell back to +1.8% in February, down from 2.1%. The Office for National Statistics doesn\u2019t suggest that the drop in inflation is due to uncertainty over next month\u2019s EU referendum. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the Treasury shoe-horning a Brexit warning into its official comment on today\u2019s data, which reads: Today\u2019s inflation figure continues the trend we\u2019ve seen over the past year. Pay is growing faster than prices, boosting families\u2019 spending power. Last week the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee warned that a vote to leave the EU would put this all at risk by hitting GDP and increasing inflation. As the Chancellor has said this would create a lose-lose situation for our economy. So it is clear Britain would be poorer outside the EU. To avoid putting our economic progress at risk we must continue with the plan that is building resilience and delivering rising living standards across Britain. Rob Weaver, director of investments at property crowdfunding platform Property Partner, blames George Osborne\u2019s tax rises for the 9% surge in house prices in March. With prospective private landlords firmly in the Chancellor\u2019s cross hairs, the rush by buy-to-let investors turned into an unavoidable stampede in the final month before the stamp duty increase. The hefty 3% hike in upfront tax bills from April this year ramped up activity to beat the deadline and in turn pushed house prices up, temporarily at least. There\u2019s no sign of deflation in the UK housing sector, where new data shows prices surging again. Britain\u2019s house prices jumped by 9% annually in March, the ONS says, as buyers rushed to beat higher stamp duty rates on buy-to-let properties. London house prices leapt by 13%, helping to drive the English house price index to a new record high. However, house prices actually dropped by over 6% in Scotland: So, is Britain heading back to deflation? Nick Dixon, investment director at Aegon UK, argues not: While inflation was weak in April, we may be closer than forecasts indicate to the inflection point when inflation starts to accelerate. A combination of rising energy costs, higher US rates, and lower \u00a3 sterling could bring inflation forward and trigger rising interest rates before the end of 2016. This chart confirms that transport costs and clothing pegged back the cost of living last month: The ONS says that air transport prices fell by 14.2% in April, having surged in March to take advantage of holidaymakers travelling for Easter. However, prices for both petrol and diesel did rise by more than they did a year ago. And clothing and footwear prices fell by 0.4% between March and April this year compared with a rise of 0.9% between the same 2 months a year ago. Much of the downward contribution came from women\u2019s outerwear, the ONS says. And that has pulled inflation back down, erasing recent gains: Falls in air fares and prices for clothing, vehicles and social housing rent were the main contributors to the drop in the inflation rate, the Office for National Statistics says. Air fares had risen sharply last month, because Easter was particularly early this year. The ONS adds: These downward pressures were partially offset by rising prices for motor fuels and for certain recreational goods and cultural services, and by food prices, which were unchanged between March and April 2016, having fallen between the same two months a year ago. Breaking: The UK inflation rate has fallen, for the first time since last September. Confounding our expectations, the Consumer Prices Index only rose by 0.3% year-on-year in April -- dashing expectations of a 0.5% reading. More to follow.... There\u2019s a significant development in the ongoing Greek drama. The IMF wants the eurozone to grant Athens almost 25 years of debt relief, in return for continuing to support the Greek bailout programme. That\u2019s according to the Wall Street Journal, which writes: The International Monetary Fund is pressing the eurozone to let Greece skip paying interest or principal on bailout loans until 2040, say officials familiar with the talks. The IMF wants the loans to Greece to fall due gradually in the following decades, and as late as 2080, according to the IMF\u2019s proposal. Greece\u2019s interest rate on eurozone loans would be fixed for 30 to 40 years at its current average level of 1.5%, with all interest payments postponed until loans start falling due, under the IMF proposal. The IMF\u2019s proposal, presented to eurozone governments late last week, would keep Greece\u2019s annual debt-service needs below 15% of its gross domestic product, under the IMF\u2019s relatively pessimistic forecast for Greece\u2019s long-term economic trajectory. More here: IMF Wants Eurozone Debt Relief for Greece Until 2040 Greek bonds are strengthening, following this news: This comes as Greece\u2019s prime minister prepares to brief his cabinet about the package of austerity measures which MPs will consider on Sunday night. They include a new privatization fund, measures for tackling bad loans, and tax increases on alcohol, coffee and heating oil (among other items). As one Greek analyst pointed out, The only thing that is not being taxed is the air we breathe. (don\u2019t give them any ideas....) The Telegraph\u2019s Ashley Armstrong has a couple of corking stories this morning. She\u2019s learned that Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, already reeling from Newcastle\u2019s relegation, has finally agreed to appear before a parliamentary committee to discuss working conditions at his company. However, he also wants MPs to visit his warehouse first! As a football chairman, Ashley (Mike, not Ms Armstrong) clearly fancies a battle on home territory before a daunting away trip to Westminster, surrounded by a hostile crowd. The Telegraph also has good news for workers at BHS; John Hargreaves, who founded the Matalan retail chain, has been working on a rescue bid for the company. Administrators at Duff &amp; Phelps are understood to be \u201cbullish\u201d about selling BHS as a going concern by the end of the week and have told suitors they must pump in cash, take on all the shops and also the chain\u2019s debt liabilities. Britain\u2019s competition authority is under fire this morning, after announcing its new proposals to shake up the banking sector. Although the CMA is proposing overdraft caps, and new measures to help customers switch, campaigners are unhappy that it isn\u2019t challenging the dominance of the big four banks. Here\u2019s the story. European stock markets are rising in early trading. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 46 points to 0.7% to 6198, the highest level since 3 May. Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey is leading the top risers, after announcing a new special dividend for investors. The rising oil price is also boosting confidence in the City, as it eases fears of an oversupply glut pushing advanced economies into deflation. The German stock market (the DAX) has jumped 1%, while the French exchange is 0.7% higher. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: A positive finish both the US and Asia, plus the fact that oil prices continue to march higher, have combined to ensure London\u2019s FTSE-100 kicks off Tuesday\u2019s session by extending yesterday\u2019s late gains Sam Hill of Royal Bank of Canada reckons the UK inflation rate will remain at 0.5% in April, matching the previous month\u2019s reading. He points out that March\u2019s inflation rate was driven up by higher travel costs, as airlines hiked prices over Easter: Although we look for some reversal in airfares after the surge last month, offsetting this there is also the higher petrol price and a number of other duty and government policy changes taking effect at the start of the new financial year, such as higher dental and prescription charges. Hill also reckons UK inflation will still be below 1% at the end of 2016 ... \u201cbut this is dependent on the outcome of the EU referendum.\u201d Oil is continuing its charge towards the giddy heights of $50 per barrel this morning. Oil prices are now at their highest level in seven months, in a sign that inflationary pressures may be building. Brent crude, from the North Sea, has gained 1% to $49.44 per barrel, a level last seen in November 2015. And US crude has jumped by 1.4%, and now changing hands at $48.39 per barrel. Oil continues to be pushed higher by recent production cuts, and supply disruption from Canada to Nigeria. As we covered yesterday, Goldman Sachs has argued that the oil market is now in deficit \u2013 meaning the world is consuming more crude than is currently being produced. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says oil is: ....benefitting from a bullish outlook upgrade from Goldman Sachs as well as more supply disruptions stemming from equipment failure and political squabbles in places like Nigeria and Venezuela - both major producing nations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A few months ago, many commentators were fretting about the threat of deflation. But with energy prices picking up, those fears look increasingly ill-founded. At 9.30am BST, we get the latest measure of UK inflation, for April. Having fallen to minus 0.1% last October, the consumer prices index scrambled back to +0.5% in March. Economists expect it remained at 0.5% in April, but aren\u2019t ruling out a higher number. A high reading might reopen the debate about when the Bank of England could finally start raising interest rates - once the thorny issue of Britain\u2019s EU referendum has been resolved, anyway. And then at 1.30pm BST, the American inflation report for April is released. Wall Street expects the annual CPI rate to rise to 1.1%, from 0.9%. America\u2019s central bank has already entered the rate-hike cycle, of course, following last December\u2019s quarter-point rise. So the Federal Reserve is now looking for signs that it made the right decision. Back on Friday, the latest US retail sales and consumer confidence reports smashed expectations, but analysts still expect the Fed to remain cautious: Alastair Winter, Daniel Stewart\u2019s chief economist, explains: Many investors seem to hope this \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 economy will persist, whereby there is enough growth and inflation to keep things moving but not enough to persuade the FOMC to hike interest rates. But as CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson points out, some Fed policy makers are making rumbling noises.... Yesterday we heard from the Richmond Fed\u2019s Jeffrey Lacker who stated that there remained a strong case for a June rate rise, however he is not on the voting committee this year, unlike the Boston Fed\u2019s Eric Rosengren who is, and who has a history of leaning to the dovish side. His comments last week about the markets potentially mispricing the timing of a Fed move on rates appear to suggest he is leaning towards a rate rise in the next few months. Also coming up today: Britain\u2019s competition authorities are announcing the results of a review of British banking. The top news is that they\u2019re proposing a cap on unauthorised mortgage charges: Vodafone, Premier Foods, Land Securities and Enterprise Inns are reporting financial results, so we\u2019ll pick over the bones at some point. And in Greece, the government is trying to rally support for another dose of austerity measures and reforms which will go to the vote on Sunday night. More on that shortly too. We\u2019ll track all the main events through the day...",

Second quarter 2016 GDP growth is now tracking at close to 3%, and the first quarter 2016 figure is bound to be revised up to 1% from the initially reported 0.5%. With inflation moving higher and financial markets much calmer, we will soon find out whether the emphasis of the data-dependency is more than a lip service.

Ben Combes at independent economic group Llewellyn Consulting said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Weekly fluctuations in [US] stocks by 4 or 5 million barrels need to be viewed in perspective. A broader sweep of history reveals that US oil stocks have been rising since 2008, and sharply so over the past year or so. Stocks are at their highest since the 1980s. One week\u2019s data \u2013 e.g. last week\u2019s 3 mb draw, perhaps reflecting recent interruptions in Canada and Nigeria \u2013 risks missing something of potential strategic significance: the supply glut seems persistent. </p> <p>There are many potential reasons why stocks are trending upwards: weak final demand; stronger than expected supply; companies building inventories at \u2018low\u2019 prices in expectation of rising prices further out. But stocks seem unlikely to remain at such elevated levels indefinitely. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f9c9ddef7b238b78ec0cc94e6c5f7ffbfe6466a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f9c9ddef7b238b78ec0cc94e6c5f7ffbfe6466a/0_0_1083_469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US oil stocks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"433\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US oil stocks</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Energy Information Administration</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>The main reason for the oil price halving in 2014, and again in 2015, was the basic global imbalance of supply and final demand: supply was, in certain months, running as much as 2m barrels a day in excess of final demand (the gap being global stock building). Such excess supply suggested that a rebalance, through the price mechanism, was inevitable. Many posit, not least given recent interruptions, that rebalancing has now run its course, and that prices stand to rise, perhaps markedly, hereafter. US stock levels, however, might well suggest otherwise. The process could be far from over. </p> <p>If the market is yet to rebalance fully, the implications for the price of oil seem clear: the market may not have yet reached its low. Moreover, any rise in price might encourage further stock building, delaying rebalancing, and resulting eventually in a larger price correction. </p> <p>To the extent that oil stocks continue to rise, the more the oil price stands eventually to fall. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573b1a3fe4b06cd267863f8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-17T13:24:55.389Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More US data, showing better than expected industrial production in April.</p> <p>Industrial output rose by 0.7% compared to forecasts of a 0.3% rise, with output from utilities bouncing back after a warmer than expected March.</p> <p>US factory output climbed 0.3%, in line with expectations, with good gains in machinery and car manufacturing.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573b15b8e4b06cd267863f7a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-17T13:15:40.092Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Is June rate hike back on the agenda?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ea65c5fa59bd872d20cbb3bd5167e0701dc8336\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ea65c5fa59bd872d20cbb3bd5167e0701dc8336/0_0_3500_2255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Federal Reserve building in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Federal Reserve building in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Could the US Federal Reserve take the plunge and raise interest rates at next month\u2019s meeting?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rob Carnell </strong>of Dutch bank <strong>ING</strong> reckons the odds of a June hike are growing, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/17/oil-50-uk-us-inflation-report-business-live?page=with:block-573b0f1de4b06cd267863f6a#block-573b0f1de4b06cd267863f6a\">today\u2019s jump in inflation</a>.</p> <p>Such a hike would surprise the markets, though, as Carnell explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Comments from Fed speakers over recent months have reiterated that June is a \u201clive\u201d month, and that two rate hikes look a reasonable prospect for 2016. But financial markets have been pricing in a far flatter curve for the Fed over the coming year. Today\u2019s inflation data is a clarion call for a market rethink on the Fed.</p> <p>In our view, the Fed has been waiting for the perfect mix of benign financial conditions, inflation heading in the right direction, and some evidence that real activity is picking up after a very soft first quarter. And although the latter condition is still debatable, decent retail sales data released last week certainly puts 2Q16 on a firmer footing as far as activity is concerned. This better run of activity data now needs to be maintained through to the June FOMC meeting, which is not by any means a given, But a June rate hike cannot be ruled out, and we will be looking at our house forecast for a 3Q16 hike as data continues to come in, to see if we need to bring this forward to June.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>David Morrison of City firm SpreadCo reckons the Fed will sit tight while the battle for the White House rages:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the Fed funds futures there\u2019s just around a 4 percent chance of an increase in June. Nevertheless, there remains a view that the Fed could still raise rates twice this year. However, that would suggest a move in September which is dangerously close to the Presidential Election.</p> <p>It seems reasonable to assume that the Fed wouldn\u2019t want to shift rates in either direction before the election. If it did, then it runs the considerable danger of being labelled partisan \u2013 particularly as this is shaping up to be a particularly vicious contest.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573b1248e4b05be498d5fbbe\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-17T12:58:33.739Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US average hourly earnings drop</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today\u2019s inflation figures also include bad news for American workers.</strong></p> <p>Real average hourly earnings actually shrank by 0.1%, once you adjust for the rising cost of living.</p> <p>That\u2019s because average earnings rose by 0.3% in April, which was more than wiped out by the 0.4% jump in the Consumer Price Index.</p> <p>Real weekly earnings rose by 0.2%, though -- because employees actually worked more hours than in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/732550693635100672\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US real average hourly earnings fall in April, first fall since June last year: <a href=\"https://t.co/zos8dbe7yB\">https://t.co/zos8dbe7yB</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/6HLn3JjKze\">pic.twitter.com/6HLn3JjKze</a></p>&mdash; Jamie McGeever (@ReutersJamie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/732550693635100672\">May 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573b12bde4b0ac0aa28f539c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-17T12:51:20.693Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/17/oil-50-uk-us-inflation-report-business-live?page=with:block-573b0f1de4b06cd267863f6a#block-573b0f1de4b06cd267863f6a\">This jump in US inflation</a> is going to reignite talk about another hike in US interest rates....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/732552768532164608\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US CPI highest in over 3 years... over to you Yellen</p>&mdash; RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/732552768532164608\">May 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/732552680829255680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Inflation.

reports</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>A few months ago, many commentators were fretting about the threat of deflation. But with energy prices picking up, those fears look increasingly ill-founded.</p> <p><strong>At 9.30am BST, we get the latest measure of UK inflation, for April.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/17/uk-inflation-negative-october-cpi\">Having fallen to minus 0.1% last October</a>, the consumer prices index scrambled back to +0.5% in March. Economists expect it remained at 0.5% in April, but aren\u2019t ruling out a higher number.</p> <p>A high reading might reopen the debate about when the Bank of England could finally start raising interest rates - once the thorny issue of Britain\u2019s EU referendum has been resolved, anyway.</p> <p><strong>And then at 1.30pm BST, the American inflation report for April is released.</strong> Wall Street expects the annual CPI rate to rise to 1.1%, from 0.9%.</p> <p>America\u2019s central bank has already entered the rate-hike cycle, of course, following last December\u2019s quarter-point rise. So the Federal Reserve is now looking for signs that it made the right decision.</p> <p>Back on Friday, the latest US retail sales and consumer confidence reports smashed expectations, but analysts still expect the Fed to remain cautious:</p> <p><strong>Alastair Winter</strong>, Daniel Stewart\u2019s chief economist, explains: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many investors seem to hope this \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 economy will persist, whereby there is enough growth and inflation to keep things moving but not enough to persuade the FOMC to hike interest rates.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"307864040caa3e54abeaa66039a3440d9244c025\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/307864040caa3e54abeaa66039a3440d9244c025/0_0_675_454/500.jpg\" alt=\"US consumer spending surged in April\" width=\"500\" height=\"336\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US consumer spending surged in April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Stewart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as <strong>CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson</strong> points out, some Fed policy makers are making rumbling noises....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Yesterday we heard from the Richmond Fed\u2019s Jeffrey Lacker</strong> who stated that there remained a strong case for a June rate rise, however he is not on the voting committee this year, unlike the <strong>Boston Fed\u2019s Eric Rosengren</strong> who is, and who has a history of leaning to the dovish side.</p> <p>His comments last week about the <strong>markets potentially mispricing the timing of a Fed move on rates</strong> appear to suggest he is leaning towards a rate rise in the next few months.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Also coming up today:</h2> <p>Britain\u2019s competition authorities are announcing the results of a review of British banking.

      "bodyText": "Banks will be forced to publish their maximum charges for unauthorised overdrafts as part of measures intended to save customers \u00a31bn over five years, by encouraging switching and breaking the stranglehold of the big four on the high street. But even as the Competition and Markets Authority pledged the measures would halve the \u00a31.2bn customers pay in unauthorised overdraft fees each year, consumer bodies, challenger banks and independent analysts said they would do little to crack the 77% market share Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays have on current accounts. The competition watchdog has spent \u00a35m on its investigation, first announced in July 2014 at a time when the Labour party was promising to create new banks. The banking industry generates \u00a314bn of revenue a year from current accounts and small businesses, and the watchdog calculated overdraft users could save up to \u00a3153 on average by switching accounts. Alasdair Smith, chair of the CMA\u2019s retail banking inquiry, is relying on the use of new technology to crack a competition conundrum that has sparked 10 investigations in the last 20 years. The CMA is ordering the major players to upgrade their IT capabilities by creating an online system that would enable price comparison websites to offer better information on rival products. This has to be done by the end of March 2017. The other measures include: Requiring that banks set out a monthly maximum charge for unauthorised overdrafts \u2013 but the watchdog held back from imposing an industry-wide cap on charges, as some had hoped. Customers to be warned by text when they go overdrawn. The Financial Conduct Authority reviewing ideas for banks to publish their service records, with data collected twice a year. Willingness to recommend the account to a friend could be included. FCA working on prompts banks could send to customers to move their accounts, such as when branches close. The beefing up of the current account switching service set up three years ago. Innovation charity Nesta offering a \u00a35m challenge prize \u2013 funded by the banks \u2013 for financial technology companies to create ways for small businesses to move accounts, although this will not be completed until mid-2018. Banks providing standard rates for small business loans and overdrafts up to \u00a325,000. Smith said the proposed saving to customers over five years of \u00a31bn was based on an increase in the number of customers switching their current accounts each year from 3% to 4%. The move on overdraft charges was welcomed by Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, who said the charity helped with 55,000 overdraft problems a year, where in some cases consumers are charged more than they would be for a payday loan. But Alex Neill, director of policy and campaigns at consumer body Which?, said: \u201cAfter 18 months this inquiry achieved little more than to propose basic information measures that the big banks should have introduced years ago. Steps to stimulate switching are welcome but the chance to deliver better banking for all consumers has been missed.\u201d Smith defended the CMA\u2019s decision to back away from avoiding radical measures such as breaking up banks or demanding account portability, whereby customers keep their account number, because it could have cost up to \u00a310bn. Criticised after its preliminary report in October for not taking bold enough measures, the CMA also incurred the wrath of challenger banks by refusing to ban \u201cfree-if-in-credit\u201d banking accounts, which rival banks say hide the true costs of banking. Paul Pester, chief executive of TSB, spun out of Lloyds, said the CMA had missed a golden opportunity by refusing to require banks to issue customers with monthly bills to tackle the hidden costs of free banking. John Lyons, retail and commercial banking leader and partner at PwC, said: \u201cA market which was seen by many as a closed shop despite new entrants looking to make inroads is unlikely to be transformed by the range of proposed remedies published today.\u201d Banks analyst Sandy Chen at Cenkos said Lloyds had most to lose because of its high share of current accounts at around 25% and its reliance on them for generating income. Customers rarely move their accounts: nearly 60% of personal customers have stayed with the same bank for more than 10 years. More than 90% of small businesses get their business loans from the bank where they have their current account. \u201cThere is therefore not going to be a single \u2018magic bullet\u2019 that puts everything right,\u201d the CMA\u2019s 400 page report said. Smith said: \u201cI don\u2019t accept ... that this is a missed opportunity ... I\u2019d rather do it properly than do it quickly. For too long, banks have been able to sit back and not work hard enough for their personal and small business customers. \u201cWe believe the strong and innovative package of measures we are proposing will give customers the information and tools they really need to get a better deal out of the banks. They will also protect those who fall into overdraft from being stung with unexpected fees.\u201d The CMA estimates that the industry will incur costs of \u00a375m\u2013 \u00a3110m to implement the changes. A consultation runs until 7 June before the final report on 12 August. Harriett Baldwin, the Treasury minister, said the report was \u201can important piece of work and we stand ready to take action once the final report is published in the summer\u201d.",

The company behind Bisto gravy and Mr Kipling cakes reported a 0.6% rise in annual sales to \u00a3772m, with sales for six of its major brands growing by an average of 3.4%. \u201cThese six brands have received more focus on innovation and marketing investment over the last two years and this result clearly demonstrates that the group\u2019s innovation and brand marketing strategy is working,\u201d the company said. Gavin Darby, chief executive, said it was an achievement against a backdrop of falling food prices. Food deflation has been running at a rate of about 1.5% to 2% over the past year, Premier said, partly driven by heightened competition in the grocery market and generally weak inflation. Darby said: \u201cWe are very pleased to report sales growth both in the year and the fourth quarter in what continues to be a deflationary market. Our strategy of investing behind our brands and bringing new innovative products to market continues to deliver very positive results. \u201cThe board is focused on delivering shareholder value and we see a strong future for Premier Foods with its leading category positions, great brands and strong operational cash flows.\u201d Premier made pre-tax losses of \u00a313m, partly associated with its stake in Hovis bread, as well as another joint venture. Adjusted profit before tax in the year to 2 April increased by 3.5% to \u00a386.1m. Last month Premier managed to shake off the advances of US company McCormick after it made three attempts to buy the food company. The maker of Schwartz dried spices and sauces abandoned its takeover approach, conceding it would not be able to offer a price acceptable to Premier. Premier Foods has however strengthened its ties with Nissin, a Japanese instant noodles company that has built a 19.9% stake in the UK company. Premier is hoping to benefit from Nissin\u2019s strength in key markets such as the US, China and Brazil through co-operation on branding and distribution. It also hopes to boost sales of existing products by using Nissin\u2019s portfolio of patents to improve them. Premier announced on Tuesday it had appointed Nissin\u2019s managing director, Tsunao Kijima, as a non-executive director.",

The mobile phone operator posted its first quarter of revenue growth in Europe since the end of 2010 after completing its project spring investment programme. It also saw strong performances in South Africa, Turkey and Egypt. Vodafone has 46.8 million 4G customers in Europe after extending its next generation mobile networks to 87% 4G coverage, The coverage is below its 90% target owing to rollout delays in the UK and Germany, it said. In emerging markets, Vodafone has 72.5 million 3G users. Vittorio Colao, the chief executive, said the multibillion-pound investment programme had transformed the quality of the group\u2019s technology. \u201cThis has been a year of strong execution for the group, returning to organic growth in both revenue and EBITDA for the first time since 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident we will sustain our positive momentum in the coming year.\u201d Vodafone posted a 2.7% rise in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to \u00a311.6bn in the year to 31 March. It predicted a further rise in profits to between \u00a312.4bn and \u00a312.8bn this year. Revenues increased 2.3% to \u00a341bn last year. Revenue from Europe grew 0.5% in the fourth quarter as two of Vodafone\u2019s biggest markets, Germany and Italy, returned to growth. However, Vodafone\u2019s performance is still lagging in the UK, where it has rolled out a broadband service but has yet to launch its TV platform. Customer complaints have soared in Britain after the group introduced a new billing system. It has become the most complained-about mobile phone provider, with customer grievances rising to 32 per 100,000 contract customers in the last three months of 2015 despite a \u00a32bn investment to improve its UK network and services. The shares rose 2.4% to 228.95p on Tuesday. Vodafone raised its full-year dividend by 2% to 11.45p. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said this was a pleasant surprise. \u201cThis means Vodafone is one of 26 FTSE 100 firms to have increased its shareholder distribution in each of the last 10 years.,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "For a country that has had so much trouble controlling the cost of living, the recent performance of prices in Britain has been extraordinary. Inflation has been below the government\u2019s 2% target for more than two years. For the best part of 18 months it has been running at under 0.5%. It fell in April to stand at just 0.3%. To be sure, there were some one-off factors at play. The early timing of Easter made a difference, because air fares rose sharply to coincide with the holiday period in March and then fell back again last month. The drop in the cost of clothing and footwear almost certainly had something to do with the dismal weather. And if you look beneath the headline number, it is possible to come up with reasons why inflation could rise gently over the coming months. Oil prices are up by $20 a barrel since the turn of the year and the deflationary impact of cheap crude on fuel prices is easing. There was a pick-up in inflation for two sectors \u2013 hotels and catering, and recreational services \u2013 likely to be affected by bigger wage bills as a result of the higher \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Even so, core inflation \u2013 which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 remains weak even though the economy is well into its seventh year of expansion. Employers are not being especially generous with their pay offers and that means core inflation \u2013 at 1.2% \u2013 is no higher than it was last autumn. The assumption among many City economists is that inflation will rise steadily in the second half of the year, putting interest rate increases from the Bank of England back on the agenda. They expect an unwinding of the sharp fall in energy prices in late 2015 coupled with a rebound in activity once the threat of Brexit is out of the way to nudge the monetary policy committee into action. These forecasts should be taken with a pinch of salt. Inflation is low and the economy was weakening even before the government announced the date of the referendum in late February. There will probably be a bit of a bounce in the third quarter if, as seems likely, the decision on 23 June is to stay in the EU. But there is more chance of the economy stalling than there is of a boom. That will keep inflationary pressure in check and should make the Bank cautious about raising rates.",

      "body": "<p>For a country that has had so much trouble controlling the cost of living, the recent performance of prices in Britain has been extraordinary. Inflation has been below the government\u2019s 2% target for more than two years. For the best part of 18 months it has been running at under 0.5%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/17/uk-inflation-falls-more-than-expected-air-fares-clothes-cars\">It fell in April to stand at just 0.3%</a>.</p> <p>To be sure, there were some one-off factors at play. The early timing of Easter made a difference, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/uk-shoppers-gain-as-prices-fall-again-in-march\">air fares rose sharply to coincide with the holiday period in March</a> and then fell back again last month. The drop in the cost of clothing and footwear almost certainly had something to do with the dismal weather.</p> <p>And if you look beneath the headline number, it is possible to come up with reasons why inflation could rise gently over the coming months. Oil prices are up by $20 a barrel since the turn of the year and the deflationary impact of cheap crude on fuel prices is easing. There was a pick-up in inflation for two sectors \u2013 hotels and catering, and recreational services \u2013 likely to be affected by bigger wage bills as a result of the higher \u201cnational living wage\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/17/uk-inflation-falls-more-than-expected-air-fares-clothes-cars\">UK inflation drops as air fares fall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even so, core inflation \u2013 which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 remains weak even though the economy is well into its seventh year of expansion. Employers are not being especially generous with their pay offers and that means core inflation \u2013 at 1.2% \u2013 is no higher than it was last autumn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-17T14:49:25/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Inflation graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-17T14:49:25/embed.html\">Inflation graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The assumption among many City economists is that inflation will rise steadily in the second half of the year, putting interest rate increases from the Bank of England back on the agenda. They expect an unwinding of the sharp fall in energy prices in late 2015 coupled with a rebound in activity once the threat of Brexit is out of the way to nudge the monetary policy committee into action.</p> <p>These forecasts should be taken with a pinch of salt. Inflation is low and the economy was weakening even before the government announced the date of the referendum in late February. There will probably be a bit of a bounce in the third quarter if, as seems likely, the decision on 23 June is to stay in the EU. But there is more chance of the economy stalling than there is of a boom. That will keep inflationary pressure in check and should make the Bank cautious about raising rates.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A rural county along the Columbia river in Oregon will have an opportunity on Tuesday to be the first in the United States to reject a Nestl\u00e9 water-bottling facility by popular ballot initiative. If successful, the measure could set a precedent making it much harder for Nestl\u00e9 and other water-bottling companies to find new sources at a time when a long drought in the American west has triggered public anger at the very notion of private companies making money and creating extensive plastic bottle waste out of a badly needed resource. The battle has been fierce, sometimes pitting neighbor against neighbor. Backers of Measure 14-55 argue that Nestl\u00e9, which hopes to pump 238m gallons of water a year from a natural spring in the town of Cascade Locks, is being invited to help itself to a precious natural resource in a time of drought, and privatize it on terms that benefit only the company. \u201cThe special arrangement for Nestl\u00e9 [over water rights] should never have happened,\u201d said Julia DeGraw, who has been helping coordinate the Yes on 14-55 campaign as a regional organizer for Food and Water Watch. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take this ballot measure on lightly \u2013 it was largely because of a complete lack of leadership from the governor.\u201d Opponents counter that Nestl\u00e9 will bring jobs and economic development to a depressed former lumber town. For years, politicians in Cascade Locks and on the local county commission have echoed Nestl\u00e9\u2019s arguments that granting the company access to water at Oxbow Springs, where the state runs a salmon hatchery, would create at least 50 \u201cfamily wage\u201d jobs and provide tax revenue to the community. \u201cThe pros outweigh the cons by a long shot,\u201d the mayor of Cascade Locks, Tom Cramblett, argued recently. Some residents complained, however, that the politicians did not hold full public hearings, accepted trips from Nestl\u00e9 to California, and presented negotiations between Nestl\u00e9 and the state authorities as a done deal that was now out of ordinary people\u2019s hands. That, in turn, triggered a revolt from locals who formed their own activist group, the Local Water Alliance, which forced the first public meeting last year and started pushing back against the official line. One activist, Katelin Stuart, said of the local politicians: \u201cI hear the words coming out of their mouths and I know it\u2019s Nestl\u00e9 talking, and that bothers me a lot.\u201d Opponents of the bottling operation fear that because of automation, local jobs are likely to be few and that 15 years of tax abatements promised to Nestl\u00e9 would restrict local revenues to a vanishing point. They also worry that hundreds of heavy trucks rumbling through Cascade Locks every day to take the water to an offsite bottling plant and then to market would incur millions of dollars in road improvement costs and have a disastrous impact on tourism and other burgeoning local businesses, including a brewery, a wood chip factory and a fish market. Those concerns have been dismissed as \u201cdisinformation\u201d by opponents including Rebecca Tweed, one of the top political lobbyists in Oregon hired by the pro-Nestl\u00e9 political action committee to snuff out the local revolt and stop passage of Measure 14-55. Despite her own outsider status, she characterized her adversaries as out-of-towners trying to impose their will on the people of Cascade Locks. \u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive campaign,\u201d she acknowledged. Cascade Locks is less than 50 miles from Portland but feels a world away along a stunning, lush green stretch of the Columbia river as it winds between mountain ranges. Unemployment runs close to 20%, well above the state average The campaign ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, which coincides with Oregon\u2019s presidential primary, has featured dueling video releases, radio ads and glossy pro-Nestl\u00e9 mailers. The two campaigns were each reported to have built campaign war chests of about $40,000 until a new filing over the weekend revealed an extra $70,000 in campaign spending by Nestl\u00e9 over the past two months via its political action committee, the Coalition for a Strong Gorge Economy. The pro-Nestl\u00e9 lobby has questioned the legality of changing the county charter to limit bottling operations to 1,000 gallons a day \u2013 about 11 times less than Nestl\u00e9 hopes to be bottling each hour. They say they expect the issue to be tied up in litigation for years if the initiative passes. DeGraw of Food and Water Watch dismissed this as a \u201cfear-mongering tactic \u2026 to scare people into voting against their personal belief\u201d. As concern over the long drought has heightened over the past two years, Nestl\u00e9 and other big water-bottling companies have found themselves increasingly under siege. In southern California, the company is struggling to negotiate a new contract with the US Forest Service to draw its Arrowhead brand water from a source in the San Bernardino National Forest following the discovery by a local newspaper last year that it had been operating without a permit since the late 1980s.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are heading higher again, helped by the continuing strength in the oil price and positive moves in the US and Asian markets, and shrugging off weaker than expected UK inflation figures. Taylor Wimpey is topping the risers, up 11p at 195.9p after the housebuilder announced a special dividend amid a strong property market. The move means it plans to pay investors \u00a31.3bn by the end of 2018, higher than the expected figure of around \u00a31.1bn. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said: Ahead of its capital markets day today, the group has announced a very positive update to its dividend policy as well as stretching its medium-term financial objectives. It has increased its ordinary dividend to around 5% of net assets to be paid through the cycle from 2017 and announced a special dividend of \u00a3300m to be paid in July 2017 (it had already announced \u00a3300m to be paid in July 2016). The group has also increased its medium-term financial targets, covering the period 2016 to 2018, given the strength of the market and the group\u2019s performance. It now expects an average return on net operating assets of 30%, an average operating margin of around 22%. Included in its financial targets it also targets a total of \u00a31.3bn of dividends to be paid to shareholders over the period 2016-18. This clearly signals another special dividend in 2018. Consensus unlikely to move significantly at this point, although the low end may move up but the news on dividends should be well received and consensus dividend expectations will likely rise. Over the next 14 months the shares offer dividends per share of around 22.5p - which implies a yield of around 12%. On trading the company said: The UK new build housing market remains very positive across most of our geographies, with a healthy and controlled lending environment providing good accessibility to mortgages at competitive rates. Consumer demand and confidence remain high. In central London, the market continues to be stable. This confidence has helped other housebuilders, with Barratt Developments up 15.5p at 553.5p and Persimmon putting on 57p to \u00a320.37. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 56.25 points at 6207.65, and Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A positive finish both the US and Asia, plus the fact that oil prices continue to march higher, have combined to ensure London\u2019s FTSE-100 kicks off Tuesday\u2019s session by extending yesterday\u2019s late gains. With metals prices finding favour too, it\u2019s no real surprise that natural resources stocks have been left scattered across the upper reaches of the board. Anglo American has added 23.4p to 632.9p while Glencore is up 4.55p at 138.15p. Positive results, including a 35.5% rise in full year profits, have lifted support services group DCC 205p to \u00a363.55. Vodafone is up 5.3p at 228.95p as the mobile phone group reported a 2.3% rise in full year revenue to \u00a341bn and said it had seen a return to growth in Europe. Among the mid caps, motor retailer Lookers said its full year results should be in line with expectations, and its shares recovered some lost ground, accelerating 10.4p to 142.1p. Liberum said: This reads as a positive statement. We do not expect material changes to consensus but the update should be taken well and we would expect a positive reaction in the shares, which are down 29% year to date.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Aussie Home Loans founder, John Symond, warned dramatically at the weekend that Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy could cause a recession. He suggested house prices could fall 10% to 20%, and waves of people could go bankrupt in its aftermath, leading to \u201cmass unemployment\u201d if Labor got its way. \u201cThat\u2019s my concern, that there could be a glut of properties come on the market, force the prices down, and then all of a sudden it could be armageddon with the housing industry that\u2019s propped up the Australian economy the last four years, it could tip it on its head,\u201d he said. How seriously should we be taking Symond\u2019s concern? The well-respected economist Saul Eslake says quite seriously, but not for the reason you may think. Symond is one of Australia\u2019s richest people, a multi-millionaire who made his money in mortgage lending. His opinion is often worth listening to because he knows more than most about the way in which Australia\u2019s property industry interacts with the banking and mortgage industries. But it\u2019s precisely because people listen to Symond that we should be concerned, Eslake says. \u201cI have a great deal of respect for John Symond, [but] I think house prices are more likely to fall because someone who is as respected and loved as him says that they will fall than because of anything that is in the Labor party\u2019s policy,\u201d Eslake told Seven\u2019s Sunrise program at the weekend. \u201cWhen people like Mr Symond say [Labor needs] to be careful, people like him need to be careful because his opinions carry a great deal of weight with the Australian community.\u201d What is the state of the debate on negative gearing? With the federal election six weeks away, the debate about Australia\u2019s housing policy is heating up considerably. Two main \u201ccamps\u201d have coalesced over recent months. In one, we have the Turnbull government, the Property Council of Australia, the Real Estate Institute of Australia, the Housing Industry Association, the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, and now John Symond. They don\u2019t want to make any changes to negative gearing or the capital gains tax discount. In the other camp, there\u2019s the Labor party, the federal Greens, the Grattan Institute, the Labor-aligned McKell Institute, the leftwing thinktank the Australia Institute, and the former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser. They do want to make changes. The second camp\u2019s concerns are shared, to varying degrees, by officials from the Reserve Bank, the Treasury, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Henry tax review panel. It\u2019s an uncontroversial point to say that the majority of economists who\u2019ve gone on the record to talk about negative gearing fall somewhere in the second camp. What do supporters of negative gearing changes say about Symond\u2019s concerns? Labor wants to restrict negative gearing to new housing, while grandfathering arrangements for people who are negatively gearing existing dwellings. Symond says he\u2019s concerned about that. He says if people are only allowed to use negative gearing to buy new properties \u2013 rather than existing properties\u2013 then they\u2019ll find it much harder to sell any properties they own, so that will make them flood the market with existing properties before Labor\u2019s policy is introduced, leading to house prices falling dramatically. But economists say Labor\u2019s grandfathering arrangements ought to prevent that from happening. In fact, the grandfathering arrangements will give negative gearers less reason to want to sell their properties, they say. Why? Because negative gearing allows investors to deduct any losses from their investments from their taxable income, helping to reduce it. If they want to keep reducing their taxable income in that way then they\u2019ll have to hold on to their properties. That means people should want to hold on to their negatively geared properties for as long as possible, preventing the market from being flooded, as Symond has warned. Officials from the Reserve Bank made that exact point in their internal memo that was released after a freedom of information request last week. When asked if there could be any negative consequences from policy changes that make negative gearing less attractive for investors, the officials said there may be a large-scale sale of negatively geared properties, but \u201conly if changes were not grandfathered\u201d.",
