      "bodyText": "Tony Hayward, the former boss of BP best remembered for being forced to resign from the oil group over his handling of the Gulf of Mexico disaster, has been revealed as a surprise candidate for the next permanent chairman of mining-cum-trading group GlencoreXstrata. Hayward is currently interim chairman of the group formed in May's $44bn (\u00a328bn) takeover of miner Xstrata by commodity trader Glencore, but had been thought to be merely holding the role temporarily as the combined group searched for a permanent replacement. However, as GlencoreXstrata announced its first results as a combined company \u2013 which included an expected writedown of the value of Xstrata's mines by $7.7bn \u2013 chief executive Ivan Glasenberg surprised mining observers by saying that Hayward is being considered for the role. \"Of course he's a candidate,\" Glasenberg said. \"We'll have to see for the future.\" Privately, Glasenberg's advisers later attempted to distance the company from the boss's comments. If Hayward did become chairman it would shock the City for a number of reasons. He is still widely associated with the string of gaffes that forced him out of BP, when his words and actions following the company's Deepwater Horizon oil spill were widely criticised. Second, he is serving as chief executive of the oil group Genel. An appointment of Hayward could also serve as a reminder of how Glencore got embroiled in an embarrassing PR mess when allowing Hayward's predecessor at BP, Lord Browne, to be announced by broadcasters as its first public chairman when it floated in 2011. In fact, Glencore had chosen Simon Murray. The continuing search for someone who can lead the board of GlencoreXstrata, which the stock market now values at \u00a339bn, was one of the issues that emerged as the company said it now valued Xstrata's assets at $7bn less than it had acquired them for. Glencore paid in shares, rather than cash, when it completed its drawn-out takeover of Xstrata in May. The Glencore share price that day implied the $44bn price tag, although the shares have since lost 14% owing to a fall in commodity prices as the Chinese economy has slowed, and closed Tuesday down 4.8p at 297.15p. Financial director Steven Kalmin said: \"We just had to value the [Xstrata] business with a blank sheet of paper. There are clearly areas where we have taken a fairly conservative approach to value in the current environment, including the greenfield, early-stage projects in which Xstrata had committed spending.\" Glencore did not explain the drop in value of the Xstrata side of the business in detail, although much of it is believed to relate to early-stage projects and greenfield operations, mines that Xstrata was building from scratch and which have long been unpopular with Glasenberg. They include a $5bn nickel operation, Koniambo in New Caledonia. The company said that total revenues in the first half of 2013 fell 2% to $121.4bn, while the firm recorded an $8.9bn loss due to the writedowns. Glasenberg signalled a new age of austerity for the company by stating that it was focusing on \"the disciplined allocation of capital\". However, the group added that its progress on integrating Xstrata into the enlarged business had \"exceeded its expectations\", and cost savings would be \"materially in excess\" of the previous guidance of $500m a year. Glencore's takeover of Xstrata was one of the most drawn out in recent City memory. The deal had long been an ambition of Glasenberg's and was announced in February 2012, but a string of rows over the price \u2013 followed by Qatar's sovereign wealth fund taking a sizeable stake in Xstrata and then threatening to block the deal \u2013 forced the chief executive into increasing his bid by almost 9%. Tuesday's write-down in Glencore's value is seen as the latest knock to its shareholders \u2013 of which Glasenberg is still the largest \u2013 and comes after the company floated at 530p.",

      "bodyText": "Communities minister Don Foster on Tuesday failed to back calls for a crackdown on \"rabbit hutch\" house building which has seen the size of new homes shrink by almost half since the 1920s. In a much-anticipated consultation paper, Foster said he would seek views from industry and others, but dashed campaigners' hopes that the government would come out in favour of new minimum space standards for new homes. \"The degree to which space standards should be developed or mandated is hotly contested and views for and against are very polarised,\" the paper said. \"The government does not have a preferred approach on space standards at this time.\" The wording was in sharp contrast to outspoken remarks from Foster's departmental boss, communities secretary Eric Pickles, who in March blamed aspects of the previous Labour government's housing policy \u2013 which have since been ditched \u2013 for condemning families to be \"trapped in rabbit hutch homes too small for their needs\". In 1920, the average semi-detached new-build had four bedrooms and measured 1,647 sq ft, according to the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Today's equivalent has three bedrooms and is 925 sq ft. Typical new terrace houses have shrunk from 1,020 sq ft and three bedrooms, to 645 sq ft and two bedrooms. Other studies have suggested England has some of the smallest housing in Europe, and that shrinking space is limiting people's routine activities at home, including socialising, home study or work and storing personal belongings. News that ministers are far from persuaded that they should impose prescriptive criteria is yet another piece of good news from Westminster for a house-building industry which is already experiencing a dramatic boost to business from George Osborne's controversial taxpayer-backed \"help to buy\" shared-equity initiative. According to government estimates, builders that add more space are only able to recover 70% of the additional cost through higher sales values. Jeff Fairburn, chief executive of Persimmon, which accounts for about 10% of the new homes market, claimed the reduction in house sizes reflected modern preferences and lifestyles. \"We have house types to maximise efficiency. [Today] you have living and cooking spaces at the back of houses and less formal dining space. I don't recognise claims that houses are too small. That is not the feedback we are getting.\" He also warned that bigger houses take more land and would lead to higher costs to buyers. Tuesday's consultation made clear ministers were now listening closely to messages from the industry. \"It is clear that in many respects the market is performing well in the absence of national space standards ... The government's preferred approach would be for market led, voluntary mechanisms such as space labelling [ie clearly advertised dimensions], in order to meet consumer needs rather than mandatory application of space standards.\" Harry Rich, chief executive of RIBA, said: \"Our public research has repeatedly revealed that space in new homes is a major concern.\"",

Bostock, who will join the business in September, replaces Coast's former boss Margaret McDonald, who left to join US lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret in July. Coast is owned by the Icelandic bank Kaupthing and the management team behind Aurora Fashions, which previously owned fellow fashion chains Karen Millen, Oasis and Warehouse. Coast became a standalone business in March this year after Karen Millen demerged from the group in 2011. The appointment of Bostock is likely to raise speculation that Coast is looking for new owners, but it is understood there are no plans to sell the business at this stage.",

As a result, Tim Owrid, head of M&amp;S's general merchandise strategic network, is to focus on the build-up of the Castle Donington operation, which should be delivering 1m items a day next year. The news comes after reports that some M&amp;S managers responsible for specific product categories were concerned about letting their merchandise be processed through the new centre because of IT issues, while some industry sources said that the problems in recent weeks had led to queues of lorries stacked up at the site waiting to unload.

    "webTitle": "Ivan Glasenberg pays $7.7bn too much for Xstrata \u2026 then calls for 'capital discipline' | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "You might have assumed that a mining boss who is admitting, in effect, that he has just overpaid for assets by $7.7bn (\u00a34.9bn) would be shy about preaching a gospel of \"capital discipline\" to the rest of the industry. Ivan Glasenberg, however, is not the shy type. Glencore's mammoth impairment charge after the Xstrata takeover was unveiled without embarrassment alongside yet another appeal for miners to concentrate on how they allocate capital. Glasenberg is, of course, spot-on in his analysis that the capital invested by the mining industry in the past decade has dwarfed returns to shareholders. A chart from BHP Billiton's presentation makes the point. BHP itself managed a compound annual growth rate of 20% in shareholder returns since June 2003 but the industry as a whole achieved only 13%. True, 13% is twice the level of the FTSE 100 index over the past decade but it still counts as a squandered opportunity during the China-inspired era of high commodity prices. The big miners, mostly, wasted their advantages through over-investment and debt binges. Xstrata and Rio Tinto, disgracefully, had to resort to rights issues to repair their balance sheets during the 2008-09 downturn. The super-cycle has now turned, thus the anxiety that everybody should refrain from bullishness. The good news for Glasenberg is that restraint is a popular tune. Andrew Mackenzie at BHP obsesses about costs and productivity and the company boasts that \"consistent with our commitment to shareholders\" no major growth projects were approved during 2013. Capital expenditure at BHP will fall by 25% this year to $16.7bn and not even the $2.6bn investment in the greenfield Jansen potash project is big enough to alter the downward trend in spending. The numbers are still large enough to fulfil the other necessity for miners to invest \"through the cycle\" but the mood has definitely shifted. Given current financial performances, it had to. BHP's attributable profit was down 29.5% to $10.9bn last year and Glencore's first-half outcome was saved (not for the first time) by its trading division. In mining, Glencore's adjusted earnings before interest and tax fell 39% to $2bn. The impossible-to-answer question is how long the big miners will have to wait for their new-found conservatism to be rewarded. Executives still cling hopefully to the prospect of 7.5% growth in GDP in China, but don't seem to have a plan B if Beijing can't deliver. That's the risk for investors. In BHP's case, there is the comfort from diversification in earnings and the fact that operating profit margins were still 33% even in a year of falling prices. This is still an immensely strong company. Glencore, as ever, offers a less predictable ride. Glasenberg is promising he can easily beat the $500m of cost savings that Xstrata's (mostly jettisoned) managers were targeting before the merger-cum-takeover was rejigged. He certainly owes his shareholders something more substantial than soundbites about others' failings. Glencore's share price has almost halved since flotation in 2011. In the capital indiscipline stakes, the worst offenders were those fund managers who paid 530p a share.",

      "body": "<p>You might have assumed that a mining boss who is admitting, in effect, that he has just overpaid for assets by $7.7bn (\u00a34.9bn) would be shy about preaching a gospel of \"capital discipline\" to the rest of the industry.</p> <p>Ivan Glasenberg, however, is not the shy type. Glencore's mammoth impairment charge after the Xstrata takeover was unveiled without embarrassment alongside yet another appeal for miners to concentrate on how they allocate capital.</p> <p>Glasenberg is, of course, spot-on in his analysis that the capital invested by the mining industry in the past decade has dwarfed returns to shareholders. A chart from BHP Billiton's presentation makes the point. BHP itself managed a compound annual growth rate of 20% in shareholder returns since June 2003 but the industry as a whole achieved only 13%.</p> <p>True, 13% is twice the level of the FTSE 100 index over the past decade but it still counts as a squandered opportunity during the China-inspired era of high commodity prices. The big miners, mostly, wasted their advantages through over-investment and debt binges. Xstrata and Rio Tinto, disgracefully, had to resort to rights issues to repair their balance sheets during the 2008-09 downturn.</p> <p>The super-cycle has now turned, thus the anxiety that everybody should refrain from bullishness. The good news for Glasenberg is that restraint is a popular tune. Andrew Mackenzie at BHP obsesses about costs and productivity and the company boasts that \"consistent with our commitment to shareholders\" no major growth projects were approved during 2013.</p> <p>Capital expenditure at BHP will fall by 25% this year to $16.7bn and not even the $2.6bn investment in the greenfield Jansen potash project is big enough to alter the downward trend in spending. The numbers are still large enough to fulfil the other necessity for miners to invest \"through the cycle\" but the mood has definitely shifted. Given current financial performances, it had to. BHP's attributable profit was down 29.5% to $10.9bn last year and Glencore's first-half outcome was saved (not for the first time) by its trading division. In mining, Glencore's adjusted earnings before interest and tax fell 39% to $2bn.</p> <p>The impossible-to-answer question is how long the big miners will have to wait for their new-found conservatism to be rewarded. Executives still cling hopefully to the prospect of 7.5% growth in GDP in China, but don't seem to have a plan B if Beijing can't deliver. That's the risk for investors.</p> <p>In BHP's case, there is the comfort from diversification in earnings and the fact that operating profit margins were still 33% even in a year of falling prices. This is still an immensely strong company.</p> <p>Glencore, as ever, offers a less predictable ride. Glasenberg is promising he can easily beat the $500m of cost savings that Xstrata's (mostly jettisoned) managers were targeting before the merger-cum-takeover was rejigged.</p> <p>He certainly owes his shareholders something more substantial than soundbites about others' failings. Glencore's share price has almost halved since flotation in 2011. In the capital indiscipline stakes, the worst offenders were those fund managers who paid 530p a share.</p>",

China faces the risk of becoming similar to the United States of old with oil import costs rising along with increasing dependency on OPEC.</p> <p>The US is adjusting to its \u2018new normal\u2019. Recent years of weak to declining US oil demand coupled with increasing domestic crude oil production and oil product exports has and will continue to facilitate a precipitous downward trend in crude oil imports and a precipitous decline in net oil imports.

US markets were up modestly in early trading: Dow Jones: +0.08% at 15,023 S&amp;P: +0.07% at 1,647 European markets are still down: FTSE 100: -0.7% at 6,417 CAC 40: -1.5% at 4,021 DAX 30: -1% at 8,283 IBEX: -2.5% at 8,442 FTSE MIB: -2% at 16,897 Capital Economics has raised its forecasts for UK growth in 2013 and 2014 against a backdrop of improving economic data. It has revised its 2013 growth forecast to 1.2% from 0.8%. It is predicting 2% growth in 2014, compared with an earlier forecast of 1.5%, and believes strong growth will really take off from 2015. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist, adds: We are revising up our GDP growth forecasts in response to the continued improvement in the economic news. Although there remain some constraints on growth which will keep it sub-par this year and next, we still think that we could be seeing pretty rapid rates of expansion from 2015 onwards. Despite this, we doubt that interest rates will rise as soon as markets are expecting. Admittedly, there is still a big question mark over how sustainable this growth is. The recovery looks in large part consumer-driven \u2013 and with real pay still falling, that means it is being financed by rising borrowing and falling saving. And the recovery still faces some significant obstacles, not least flat bank lending and the ongoing fiscal squeeze. Indeed, the data may well weaken a touch in the near-term. That said, as next year progresses, a recovery in real pay should finally get going. Meanwhile, the tentative improvement in the euro-zone economy suggests that external factors will not be as big a drag as we had expected. We expect GDP growth in 2015 of 3%, which should mark the start of a lengthy period of strong growth for the UK. Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's finance minister, has admitted Greece will need a third aid package, following mounting market speculation. \"There will have to be another programme in Greece,\" he talk an audience in an election campaign speech. He added there would be no further debt haircut for Athens. It would no doubt be unpopular among voters at Germany's election on 22 September, but his comments came as Reuters quoted an anonymous Greek finance ministry official highlighting an expected funding shortfall over 2014-2016: Greece and its lenders are examining several ways to plug any funding gap that Greece will face over the next few years. Irish house prices were 1.2% higher in July than June according to the latest report from the country's Central Statistics Office, driven higher by demand for property in Dublin. Dublin prices grew by 3.3% in July, while property prices in the rest of Ireland were down 0.1% On an annual basis Irish house prices were 2.3% higher in July, building on the 1.2% annual rise in June. A year earlier in July 2012 Irish house prices were down 13.6% annually. Anthony Baert, an economist at ING, comments: Prospects for the Irish residential property market look moderately good. Housing loans increased by 4.5% year on year in the second quarter, the third consecutive increase. The number of housing permits also increased in the first quarter, but it was from an all time low reached in the fourth quarter of 2012. Moreover, one should keep in mind that household indebtedness remains high at 106% of GDP, although it is declining. With a ratio of household debt to income still at 208%, historical mortgage debt will continue to weigh not only on the housing market but also on the wider economic recovery, since households prioritise debt repayment over house purchase and consumer spending. Therefore, we expect house prices to grow by 0.9% in 2013. Ireland's housing market suffered a huge crash when the financial crisis took hold, and house prices in Dublin are still 52% than their peak in early 2007. Prices in the rest of Ireland are 49% lower. That's what's going to happen after 2015 according to energy and metals consultancy Wood Mackenzie. It says China's demand for energy has been rising strongly as a result of its economic growth, with a lack of domestic oil resources to meet that demand. In Wood Mackenzie\u2019s current forecast, China\u2019s crude oil import volumes surpass the US post-2015. China faces the risk of becoming similar to the United States of old with oil import costs rising along with increasing dependency on OPEC. The US is adjusting to its \u2018new normal\u2019. Recent years of weak to declining US oil demand coupled with increasing domestic crude oil production and oil product exports has and will continue to facilitate a precipitous downward trend in crude oil imports and a precipitous decline in net oil imports. Unlike China, US import costs are falling, as is its dependency on non-North American crudes. China is on course to spend $500bn (\u00a3319bn) on crude oil imports by 2020, outpacing a peak US spend on oil imports of $335bn according to Wood Mackenzie. It predicts US crude oil imports will fall to around $160bn over the same period, as US output from shale resources replaced imports from the Middle East and Africa. Meanwhile oil prices towards $109 a barrel as investors took profits before the Fed publishes the minutes of the latest policy meeting on Wednesday. Losses are being limited however by the crisis in Egypt, with the Suez Canal strategically important for oil transportation to the west. Joerg Asmussen, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, will visit Greece on Wednesday to discuss the country's progress on reforms. His visit comes amid speculation that Greece may need further funds to meet its budget targets, and ahead of a trip to Athens by the troika of international lenders, planned for Autumn. According to Reuters the ECB said: In the run-up to the next troika review mission, ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen will visit Athens for bilateral meetings with Greek policy makers and representatives of society and the business community to discuss the Greek adjustment program and wider euro area developments. Meanwhile Helena Smith, the Guardian's correspondent in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, reports that Greece's only Ferrari dealership has had no sales for nearly two years. She writes the collapse of the country's car market \"has become emblematic of hardship as Greeks endure some of the most biting austerity measures in modern times\". Read the full story here. Construction output in the eurozone rose 0.7% in June compared with May. It followed a 0.5% rise in May according to the figures from the EU's statistics agency Eurostat. However on an annual basis construction output was 3% lower in June. Gross mortgage lending jumped 29% to \u00a316.6bn in July compared with a year earlier, the highest level since October 2008 according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders' figures. It was a 12% increase on June's figure of \u00a314.8bn. Caroline Purdey of the CML said it was the latest sign of a strengthening housing market and wider economy. An improvement in sentiment and activity continues to show in the UK housing and mortgage markets, with a more positive picture also starting to emerge in the economy. Our forward estimate of gross mortgage lending in July reinforces a growing evidence base of a strengthening in the housing and mortgage markets. Bonus payouts in the year to March 2013 totalled \u00a336.9bn, a 1% increase compared with a year earlier according to the Office for National Statistics. Of that, \u00a313.3bn was paid out in the finance and insurance industry, virtually unchanged from the previous year. Read the Guardian's full story here. The average bonus per employee was \u00a31,400, with big differences between sectors: Finance and insurance: \u00a311,900 Mining and quarrying : \u00a36,700 Education, health and social work: \u00a3100 The average bonus paid out in the private sector was \u00a31,700, more than five times the average public sector worker's bonus of \u00a3300. A number of businesses deferred bonuses usually paid in March to April this year. Taking that into consideration, bonus payments for the period May 2012 to April 2013 were up 4% at \u00a338.6bn. It follows a report showing male bosses in the UK are being paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs. The disparity, revealed by the Chartered Management Institute, means that men enjoy salary top-ups of \u00a3141,500 more than women over the course of a working lifetime. Men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of \u00a36,442 last year \u2013 compared with \u00a33,029 for women. Read the full story from the Guardian's Simon Goodley here.

As the Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott explains, the run on the rupee has been triggered by the expectation that the Federal Reserve will soon scale-back its bond-buying programme, which has consequences for all emerging market economies: Firstly, there is the fear that a reduced stimulus will mean weaker growth in the US, with a knock-on impact on exports from the developing world. Secondly, high-yielding currencies such as the rupee have benefited from a search for yield on the part of global investors. If policy is going to be tightened in the US, then the dollar becomes more attractive and the rupee less so. On past form, emerging market crises go through three stages: in stage one, policymakers do nothing in the hope that the problem goes away. In stage two, they cobble together some panic measures, normally involving half-baked capital controls and selling of dollars in an attempt to underpin their currencies. In stage three, they either come up with a workable plan themselves or call in the IMF. India is on the cusp of stage three. Good morning. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Japan's Nikkei fell 2.6% to 13,396 after touching a seven-week low on the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's plan to ease its bond-buying programme. The US Federal Reserve will publish minutes of its latest policy meeting on Wednesday, and markets will be looking for any hints on the pace of easing, which many are expecting to begin in September. The Nikkei's fall followed Wall Street losses, and a broad sell-off in Asia. More on that soon. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said European markets were also likely to open lower: In the absence of significant new factors, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s latest FOMC minutes we can expect markets to push lower this morning with a lower European open, after Asia followed US markets by sliding back as well. One of the few bright spots in European markets in recent weeks has been the recent performance of the CAC40 over the last eight weeks; however yesterday\u2019s decline might well see the beginning of the end of that particular uptrend",

      "bodyText": "Across the United States, co-ordinated walkouts against low pay have spread from the giant retail chain Walmart to fast-food outlets and upmarket retailers. Outside branches of McDonald's, workers have chanted the slogan - \"supersize our wages\" \u2013 in a campaign for $15 an hour, more than double the federal minimum wage.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's best-paid workers delayed bonus payments worth up to \u00a31.7bn until April to take advantage of George Osborne's 5p cut in the top rate of tax, according to evidence collected by the Office for National Statistics. Bonuses across the economy were all but flat in the year to March 2013, increasing by 1% compared with the same period a year ago, to \u00a336.9bn, or an average \u00a31,400 per employee. But the ONS said the picture was distorted by firms deferring payouts until April, when those earning over \u00a3150,000 a year would pay income tax at 45p instead of 50p in the pound. Payouts were \u00a31.7bn higher in April than the same month last year, with the banking and finance sector accounting for \u00a3700m of the increase. Some of the rise since April 2012 is likely to reflect a more generous bonus round \u2013 taking January to April together, bonuses in the finance sector were up by 13% on last year, at \u00a310.3bn. But the ONS said businesses had reported deliberately deferring their bonus rounds so that employees could benefit from the tax cut. If the \u00a31.7bn had been handed over to staff before the 50p top rate was scrapped it would have brought the Treasury an extra \u00a385m. Reducing the 50p rate of tax brought in by Alistair Darling at the height of the economic crisis in 2009 was the most controversial policy in last year's \"omnishambles\" budget. Treasury officials insisted yesterday that the higher rate had generated little, if any, extra revenue. A spokesman said the bonus data were, \"broadly in line with the Budget forecast\". However, labour market expert John Philpott, of consultancy the Jobs Economist, said, \"I just find it deplorable: there should have been a failsafe built into the policy that allowed for some sort of clawback if that behaviour was seen to occur. I don't see why that's any less immoral than all the tax avoidance practices the coalition have criticised.\" Labour said the data helped hammer home its argument that the majority of people in Britain are suffering a \"cost of living crisis\", while the lucky few are thriving. Chris Leslie, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said, \"working people are worse off under the Tories as prices continue to rise faster than wages. But while ordinary families on low and middle incomes are seeing their living standards fall those at the top are reaping the benefits of David Cameron's tax cut for millionaires.\" Taking the 2012-13 financial year as a whole \u2013 and excluding the April payouts \u2013 finance workers banked the biggest bonuses, according to the ONS, taking home an average of \u00a311,900 per employee. The sector was followed by mining and quarrying, where the average bonus was \u00a36,700; and IT, where it was \u00a34,400. Excluding the financial sector, total bonuses across the rest of the economy in 2012-13 were \u00a323.6bn, almost as high as during 2007-08, before the UK plunged into recession. Despite high-profile stories about lavish payouts for top public sector bosses, bonuses remain largely a private sector phenomenon, the ONS data shows. The average bonus in the public sector was \u00a3300 per employee \u2013 falling to \u00a3100 once the bailed-out banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, are excluded. Private sector employees received bonuses worth on average \u00a31,700. Tuesday's findings about financial services firms delaying payments to cut their employees' tax bills will fuel controversy about remuneration practices in the sector, after research showed that many firms were planning to increase salaries, to bump up their staff's total pay as the European Union prepares to cap bonuses. A separate report from the Chartered Management Institute suggested that male bosses receive bonuses up to twice as high as their female colleagues.",
