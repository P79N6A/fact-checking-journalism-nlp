    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mothercare has parted company with its chief executive six weeks after issuing a dramatic profit warning. The mothers-to-be and babies store said Simon Calver had resigned as chief executive with immediate effect and would be leaving the company at the end of March. Calver, who served less than two years in the top job, takes away a \u00a3250,000 payoff in lieu of six months' notice, plus \u00a344,540 in forgone pension contributions. The former management consultant and branding expert was poached by Mothercare from the LoveFilm DVD and games rental company in 2012 to lead its turnaround effort, after years of falling sales. His predecessor as chief executive, Ben Gordon, stood down \"by mutual consent\" after a profit warning, at the instigation of Mothercare's chairman, Alan Parker. But the retailer has continued to struggle, despite closing scores of unprofitable stores and expanding its online presence. Last month, Mothercare admitted it had had a poor Christmas, with heavy discounting and weak toy sales eating into profits. The store's broker slashed its profit expectations by more than half to \u00a38m, causing the share price to tumble. The weakness of the UK business has left the group reliant on Mothercare's 1,070 international stores to stay in profit. The company has about 230 stores under the Mothercare and Early Learning Centre brands in the UK. But they made a loss of \u00a321.7m in the most recent financial year, making it another middle-market casualty struggling to compete with cheaper baby clothes in supermarkets and more upmarket offerings from department stores. In a statement on Monday, Mothercare said it was confident its financial results would be in line with market forecasts and vowed to continue efforts to restore profitability. It did not give a reason for Calver's departure, but it is understood the board had doubts about his retail skills and abilities to nurse Mothercare back to profitability in its home market. Parker said the store had made progress on its turnaround plan since Calver joined in April 2012. \"In particular, Simon Calver's e-commerce expertise has allowed Mothercare to accelerate its development as a multichannel retailer in the UK. We wish him well in the future,\" he said. \"Mothercare has a strong executive management team which is very capable of running the business in the interim while the search for a new CEO is under way.\" Calver will stay on hand to provide unspecified \"transitional support\" until the end of March. The retail analyst Nick Bubb said Calver's departure was a bit of a shock. \"Mothercare CEO Simon Calver certainly talked a good story, but with the performance of the business continuing to disappoint, the hard-nosed chairman Alan Parker has clearly decided that it's time for another change at the top, to make sure that Mothercare shrinks, stabilises the UK business and grows the overseas operations,\" he said. Mothercare declined to comment on candidates to succeed Calver, although whoever takes the job will pick up a turnaround plan of reducing the number of UK stores to fewer than 200. Carly Syme, a senior analyst at Verdict, said Mothercare needed a chief executive with retail experience. \"They should not just rely on this person coming in and thinking they know about online, so it is all going to be OK. They have got to have broad knowledge of how stores work, as well as online sales.\" \"Mothercare is still a strong brand in the UK,\" she added, but she urged the retailer to look at where it was situated in the market. \"It may need more value ranges to compete with the grocers and more premium products that it could charge a bit extra for.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dixons and Carphone Warehouse are discussing a \u00a33.5bn merger that could create a powerful new force on the UK high street and a new FTSE 100 retailer. The proposed deal, bringing household names Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse under one umbrella, would forge a retail powerhouse with 3,000 stores and sales approaching \u00a312bn. Analysts warned, however, that the alliance could trigger job cuts and some store closures in the UK. In a statement released to the Stock Exchange the companies said talks were at a \"very preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that a transaction will be forthcoming\". The tie-up, which is being billed as a \"merger of equals\", was well received by investors with Dixons shares closing up nearly 7% at 50.3p while Carphone Warehouse closed up almost 9% at 333p. Carphone has 2,037 stores worldwide and annual sales of \u00a33.7bn while Dixons has 947 stores and a turnover of \u00a38.2bn. Some experts think the deal makes more sense for Dixons, which has just completed a painful restructuring and is looking for new avenues of growth. Ben Spruntulis, retail analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said Dixons would be able to piggyback on Carphone's expertise in selling mobile phones and tablets as well as its relationships with network operators. Dixons has 150 Phones 4U concessions in its stores but would like a bigger slice of the lucrative smartphone market and could hand them over to Carphone when the contract expires next year. Together, the retailers would have more than 1,200 stores in Britain, and Spruntulis predicted savings could be made through closures and a pooled head office. Both companies have head offices in south-east England, each with annual running costs of \u00a315m-20m. At the end of last week, Carphone had a market capitalisation of \u00a31.8bn while Dixons, led by chief executive Sebastian James, was valued at \u00a31.7bn. The enlarged group would have an estimated market value of \u00a33.5bn and is likely to be eligible for listing on the FTSE 100. \"No decision has been reached regarding the structuring of any such merger,\" said the companies, which also held talks in 2011. Under stock market rules, the companies have until 5pm on 24 March to announce whether the tie-up is going ahead. Both retailers are grappling with structural changes in the industry as sales move online and manufacturers such as Apple establish their own successful retail chains. Analysts also point to competitive threats faced by Dixons such as the growth of website AO.com, formerly Appliances Online, which is gearing up for a \u00a31.2bn flotation. \"It is slightly harder at this stage to see what's in it for Carphone,\" said retail analyst Nick Bubb. \"Mergers of equals aren't easy to arrange, because neither is dominant enough to drive through the changes required.\" The proposed marriage, revealed by financial blog Betaville, would unite two former adversaries. In 2008, Carphone threw its hat in the electricals ring when it struck a \u00a31.1bn deal with the US electricals group Best Buy to bring the brand to the UK. The tie-up was supposed to wreak havoc for Dixons but ended in failure with the loss-making chain closing down in 2011. It is also back to the future for Dixons, which sold its 300-strong mobile phone chain The Link to network operator O2 for \u00a330m in 2006. Charles Dunstone, who founded Carphone in 1989 and still owns 23.4%, is said by insiders to be enthusiastic about the deal. If it succeeds, he is expected to chair the enlarged group, with James as chief executive. Such a set-up creates uncertainty for Carphone veteran Andrew Harrison, who took over as chief executive last summer, but he and the deputy chairman, Roger Taylor, are both expected to have senior roles in the new venture. The deal is expected to involve shares rather than cash, with Dunstone retaining his large holding. A merger would complete the rehabilitation of Dixons which made its high street debut in 1937 when Charles Kalms opened a photographic studio in Southend. Over 50 years, his son, now Lord Kalms, turned it into a retail empire but, by the end of the last decade, it was struggling to keep pace in a market under siege from the internet. The financial crisis and the attendant collapse in consumer confidence triggered a major restructuring which culminated with the disposals of the Pixmania website as well as operations in Turkey, Spain and Italy. By the time of its annual results last summer, James was able to say its troubles were finally behind it and that it had made the transition from \"survivor to winner\". The merger would also provide both companies with the opportunity for a much needed rebranding. \"Carphone Warehouse's name has long been anachronistic because it doesn't sell carphones and it doesn't operate warehouses,\" said Bubb. \"In the same way, it is increasingly odd that Dixons mainly trades as Currys and PC World in the UK.\" Dixons Brands: Currys, Dixons Travel, PC World, Elkj\u00f8p and Electroworld Employees: 31,000 Headquarters: Hemel Hempstead Chief executive: Sebastian James Sales: \u00a38.2bn (year to 30 April 2013) Pre-tax profits: \u00a394.5m Stores: 947 worldwide, in the UK 458 Countries: UK, Ireland, Greece, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Czech Republic and Slovakia Carphone Warehouse Brands: Carphone Warehouse, Phone House, 46% of Virgin Mobile France, partnerships with Media Markt and Metro Headquarters: Acton, west London Chief executive: Andrew Harrison Sales: \u00a33.7bn (year to 31 March 2013) Pre-tax profits: \u00a359m Stores: 2,037 worldwide (UK 785) Countries: UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Sweden",

In 2008, Carphone threw its hat in the electricals ring when it struck a \u00a31.1bn deal with the US electricals group Best Buy to bring the brand to the UK. The tie-up was supposed to wreak havoc for Dixons but ended in failure with the loss-making chain closing down in 2011. It is also back to the future for Dixons, which sold its 300-strong mobile phone chain The Link to network operator O2 for \u00a330m in 2006.</p> <p>Charles Dunstone, who founded Carphone in 1989 and still owns 23.4%, is said by insiders to be enthusiastic about the deal. If it succeeds, he is expected to chair the enlarged group, with James as chief executive. Such a set-up creates uncertainty for Carphone veteran Andrew Harrison, who took over as chief executive last summer, but he and the deputy chairman, Roger Taylor, are both expected to have senior roles in the new venture.</p> <p>The deal is expected to involve shares rather than cash, with Dunstone retaining his large holding.</p> <p>A merger would complete the rehabilitation of Dixons which made its high street debut in 1937 when Charles Kalms opened a photographic studio in Southend. Over 50 years, his son, now Lord Kalms, turned it into a retail empire but, by the end of the last decade, it was struggling to keep pace in a market under siege from the internet.</p> <p>The financial crisis and the attendant collapse in consumer confidence triggered a major restructuring which culminated with the disposals of the Pixmania website as well as operations in Turkey, Spain and Italy. By the time of its annual results last summer, James was able to say its troubles were finally behind it and that it had made the transition from \"survivor to winner\".</p> <p>The merger would also provide both companies with the opportunity for a much needed rebranding. \"Carphone Warehouse's name has long been anachronistic because it doesn't sell carphones and it doesn't operate warehouses,\" said Bubb. \"In the same way, it is increasingly odd that Dixons mainly trades as Currys and PC World in the UK.\"</p> <h2>Dixons</h2> <p><strong>Brands:</strong> Currys, Dixons Travel, PC World, Elkj\u00f8p and Electroworld</p> <p><strong>Employees:</strong> 31,000</p> <p><strong>Headquarters:</strong> Hemel Hempstead</p> <p><strong>Chief executive:</strong> Sebastian James</p> <p><strong>Sales: </strong>\u00a38.2bn (year to 30 April 2013)</p> <p><strong>Pre-tax profits:</strong> \u00a394.5m</p> <p><strong>Stores: </strong>947 worldwide, in the UK 458</p> <p><strong>Countries:</strong> UK, Ireland, Greece, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Czech Republic and Slovakia</p> <h2>Carphone Warehouse</h2> <p><strong>Brands: </strong>Carphone Warehouse, Phone House, 46% of Virgin Mobile France, partnerships with Media Markt and Metro</p> <p><strong>Headquarters:</strong> Acton, west London</p> <p><strong>Chief executive:</strong> Andrew Harrison</p> <p><strong>Sales: </strong>\u00a33.7bn (year to 31 March 2013)</p> <p><strong>Pre-tax profits:</strong> \u00a359m</p> <p><strong>Stores: </strong>2,037 worldwide (UK 785)</p> <p><strong>Countries:</strong> UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Sweden</p>",

      "bodyText": "The merger talks between Dixons and Carphone Warehouse were born from a discussion about a different deal. Plan A was the less ambitious proposal to install Carphone outlets in lots of Dixons, Currys and PC World stores in the UK. That deal would be easy to understand. Dixons would boot out Phones4U, which currently has concessions in 160 of its 500-odd stores, in favour of the market leader in mobile phone retailing. Carphone would get access to more customers and a chance to repeat the success it achieved in the US via a partnership with Best Buy, which has since been unwound. Is Plan B \u2013 a full-blown merger \u2013 a better structure? There seem to be two arguments in favour. First, proper mergers allow proper savings to be made. The actual scope in this case is hard to estimate but a combined base of annual revenues of \u00a312bn ought to yield something in the form of increased buying power with big suppliers. The second argument is more wishy-washy. It's the notion that the products themselves are changing, that lines are becoming blurred and that connected devices are cropping up everywhere. It's televisions today, but maybe fridges tomorrow. On this line of thinking, Carphone's and Currys' markets will collide in the age of the \"internet of things\", so it's best to make a virtue of the fact and discover what the customers actually want. It's a tantalising argument. One chief worry, though, is whether customers' shopping habits are evolving as fast as visions of gadget connectivity in corporate boardrooms. Carphone is a force of nature in mobile phone retailing thanks to its single-minded focus and the perceived independence of advice. It's hard to know how punters would react if a lovely deal on a fridge-freezer is shoe-horned into the conversation. Still, Sir Charles Dunstone, Carphone founder, usually knows what he is doing. If he thinks a full-blown merger is the way to go, shareholders will back him. In any case, he owns 23% of the company. As for Dixons' investors, a helping of the Dunstone magic will probably appeal. Carphone's shares rose 8.8% and Dixons' 6.6%. The stars, and not just the market capitalisations of the two companies, seem sufficiently aligned for this deal to happen, with Dunstone as chairman and Dixons' Seb James as chief executive. Let's hope, though, that the duo reveal why Plan B is so much better than the simpler Plan A. It may be, but an explanation is required.",

    "webTitle": "HSBC hands allowances to hundreds of bankers to avoid EU bonus cap", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A defiant HSBC is handing its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, allowances worth \u00a332,000 a week \u2013 on top of his \u00a31.2m salary \u2013 to get around the EU's cap on bonuses, in a move that is expected to be replicated by the other high street banks. HSBC became the first UK bank to reveal how it will sidestep the pay restrictions imposed by Brussels, as it further fuelled the debate over City pay by also revealing that 239 of its bankers received more than \u00a31m last year. Gulliver, the boss of Britain's biggest bank, hit out against the new rules, which restrict bonuses to 200% of salary even with shareholder approval, but the TUC accused HSBC of \"soaraway boardroom greed\". The \u00a31.7m \"fixed pay allowance\", paid in shares every three months on top of Gulliver's salary, will ensure he is paid a minimum of \u00a34.2m a year, up from \u00a32.5m now. Similar allowances, in shares that cannot be sold for five years, are being handed to 111 top bankers at HSBC, while another 554 are to be handed extra payments in cash. The move prompted Labour to call for a repeat of its bonus tax while the Robin Hood Tax campaign said the payments bolstered its argument for a tax on financial transactions. \"HSBC haven't so much circumvented rules on bonuses as driven a coach and horses through them. The only way to rein in bankers' remuneration is to make banks pay their fair share to society,\" a Robin Hood Tax campaigner said. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"It would be great if banks put the same effort into lending to small businesses and investing in infrastructure as they do to getting round EU rules on boardroom bonuses.\" HSBC's response to the Brussels bonus cap was contained in its annual report, which showed profits rose 9% to $22.5bn (\u00a313.6bn) in 2013, when its bonus pool for staff rose 6% to $3.9bn. A year ago HSBC made $20.6bn profits and paid 204 of its staff more than \u00a31m, although its shares were among the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares on disappointment that the profit rise was not greater. However, the rise in bonuses at HSBC was in contrast to Barclays, which increased them by 10% even though its profits fell 32%. HSBC said its dividends to shareholders were up 11% while staff costs were down 6%. Barclays is among the banks \u2013 including the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 that are expected to follow HSBC by handing out allowances to top staff as they respond to the EU cap on bonuses, which affects payouts to be made this time next year. The disclosures by HSBC came as the pay-setting committee of RBS prepared to meet to confirm the bonus pool for its 120,000 staff. The size of the pot, expected to be \u00a3500m, will be announced on Thursday, when the 81% taxpayer-owned bank is expected to report losses of \u00a38bn. \"We don't want to do this at all,\" said Gulliver, whose total pay and bonuses in 2013 were \u00a38m, up from \u00a36.3m the previous year. He stressed his maximum potential pay each year would fall to \u00a311.4m from \u00a313.8m to counteract the rise in the fixed part of his pay. Gulliver, who started his career at HSBC more than 30 years ago as a currency dealer, also receives \u00a379,000 for the use of cars in Hong Kong and accommodation there worth \u00a3229,000. George Osborne is taking legal action against the Brussels cap and Gulliver said the bank would revert to its previous schemes if this was successful. \"We had a compensation plan here that the shareholders liked but sadly because of the EU directive we've had to change. This isn't something we would have wanted to do \u2026 It's much more complicated,\" Gulliver said. The Bank of England's Andrew Bailey has warned the cap could lead to a \u00a3500m rise in fixed salary costs at the big banks and make them riskier. Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury select committee who also chaired the parliamentary commission on banking standards, said: \"A crude bonus cap does nothing to incentivise higher standards. What we need is a fundamental reform of the bonus culture including much longer deferral and much greater scope for clawback, as the banking commission proposed.\" HSBC \u2013 which after a \u00a31.2bn fine in 2012 is subject to tough restrictions imposed by the US authorities \u2013 risked further controversy over pay by revealing that its chairman, Douglas Flint, who in the past has not received bonus payments, is line for new share awards because of his role in \"intense regulatory change\". The move could allow Flint to receive maximum pay of \u00a34.6m a year, up from \u00a32.4m. Gulliver has taken the axe to costs since being promoted to chief executive three years ago, cutting 40,000 roles and pulling out of 63 countries or businesses. The bank \u2013 one of the highest dividend payers in the FTSE 100 \u2013 said that the government's bank levy on its balance sheet had cut its dividend by $0.05 per share as it had cost $904m last year, while it had set aside another $395m for misselling payment protection insurance and products to small businesses. From the start of this year, the bank has changed the way it pays the staff in its retail division to remove the link between sales and bonuses, with a view to cutting misselling bills. Despite the controversy over the cap, Gulliver gave a clear commitment to remaining in the UK, although the bank generates less than 10% of its profits here. Some 70% of its business is generated in Hong Kong and the Asia-Pacific region, and Gulliver said that 208 bankers in London would receive the three-monthly allowances compared with 395 outside the UK. It employs 254,000 people, 46,000 of them in the UK. In total the bank has 1,318 employees whose bonuses must be capped under the new rules \u2013 those regarded as taking and managing risks \u2013 but just over 650 will receive no extra allowances. In more than 600 pages of documents, the bank also gave further breakdowns of staff pay, revealing for the first time the number of staff paid more than \u20ac1m \u2013 some 330 \u2013 and that 192 bankers defined as key staff received an average pay deal of $1.5m (\u00a3900,000). Barclays has told staff affected by the cap that they will receive the payments, called role-based allowances, each month alongside their salaries but has yet to disclose how much its chief executive, Antony Jenkins, will receive. Jenkins has turned down a potential bonus of \u00a32.7m on top of his \u00a31.1m salary but still stands to receive at least \u00a34m from long-term share plans due to be released next month. The new boss of RBS, Ross McEwan, has waived his payout. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the boss of Lloyds, is receiving a \u00a31.7m bonus on top of his \u00a31m salary, a \u00a3500,000 pension contribution and a payout from a long-term incentive plan that could total \u00a32.9m \u2013 half the potential sum \u2013 when it is formally revealed next month.",

Earlier this month the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras gave a taste of that gulf by departing from usual optimism to tell a stunned audience in Athens that: \u201cthe troika has been tragically wrong in their forecasts and this has created huge problems.\u201d At stake are major differences over the extent of the primary budget surplus Greece hopes to post at the end of the 2013 \u2013 the figures are expected to be made public on April 23 \u2013 and troika mandated reforms aimed at making the economy more competitive.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. Merger activity and market optimism has driven the FTSE 100 to its highest closing level in 14 years. Details and reaction start here. In America, the S&amp;P 500 hit a fresh record high. HSBC has been criticised for introducing new fixed pay allowances to dodge the EU\u2019s bonus cap, and for paying more of its staff over \u00a31m per year. The news broke this morning..... here\u2019s an afternoon round-up of the best reaction. Two UK retailers, Dixons and Carphone Warehouse, are in possible merger talks. It could create a \u00a33.5bn powerhouse in the mobile technology sector -- and could mean job cuts.... In the eurozone, Greece\u2019s Troika of lenders have returned to Athens, sneaking in through the back entrance to avoid protests outside. There were also clashes in Cyprus between electricity workers and riot police, as MPs debated plans to privatise state bodies to raise funds for its bailout. Inflation in the eurozone remains worryingly low, rising by just 0.8% annually in January. Prices fell by 1.1% month-on-month, putting pressure on the ECB to take fresh stimulus measures. Key charts here. And Italy\u2019s new prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has promised to bring in political and judicial reforms, and shake up the economy, in his first big speech to the Senate. Here\u2019s a transcript. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Meanwhile in Athens, Troika officials have finally returned to Greece to continue talks on its bailout programme. Negotiations resumed in an ignominious fashion -- with senior officials forced to skulk into the finance ministry through the rear entrance to avoid protests. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: After a two-months hiatus, visiting auditors resumed negotiations in Athens by sneaking into its finance ministry via the backdoor because of protesting cleaners. Although heavily armed riot police encircled the building, mission chiefs representing the EU, ECB and IMF could not be protected from the volley of furious slogans lobbed their way by about 50 cleaners who gathered outside stand to lose their jobs at the finance ministry in March. The women \u2013 many single mothers who have worked at the ministry for years \u2013 have become one of the most potent symbols of austerity-hit Greece. Officially, the Greek government hopes to unlock its next tranche of aid within a few weeks, ending months of deadlock. But behind the scenes, officials admit it will be tricky. Helena explains: The return of the representatives for talks that started in September before being broken off just before Christmas has been met with thinly disguised relief by the government. Athens, which has been kept afloat with bailout funds since May 2010, is now owed an estimated \u20ac10.1bn in emergency aid instalments dating back to June. It faces bond repayments of \u20ac9.3bn in May \u2013 the biggest single debt redemption for the next 30 years - and without the funds officials acknowledge its economy will once again be hanging by a thread. Publicly, prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 fragile two-party government is saying it expects the problem-plagued negotiations to be completed by March 10 \u2013 the deadline both sides have set. Privately, officials admit that the differences remain legion. Earlier this month the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras gave a taste of that gulf by departing from usual optimism to tell a stunned audience in Athens that: \u201cthe troika has been tragically wrong in their forecasts and this has created huge problems.\u201d At stake are major differences over the extent of the primary budget surplus Greece hopes to post at the end of the 2013 \u2013 the figures are expected to be made public on April 23 \u2013 and troika mandated reforms aimed at making the economy more competitive. Officials are adamantly refusing to adopt any more belt-tightening measures calling the very prospect of such a \u2018red line.\u201d The troika has not ruled out further cost-cutting in the months ahead. More reaction to the FTSE closing at its highest level since it peaked in December 1999: And one government MP, David Rutley, is claiming the rally shows the UK\u2019s economic politics are working.... Mark Ward, head of execution trading at Sanlam Securities, reckons the FTSE 100 will smash through the 7,000 point mark this year. Ward told Reuters: \u201cBunzl and Vodafone are looking good. We\u2019ve got a 7,000 target for the FTSE in the next few months.\u201d Here\u2019s the biggest risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 tonight, as it settles at its highest closing price since the peak of the dot-com boom: At 6865 points, the FTSE 100 index is just 85 points, or 1.2%, away from its all-time high of 6950 points set way back on 30 December 1999, before the dot-com bubble burst. It ended the millennium at 6930 points. And while it hit a 14-year closing high tonight, the FTSE 100 has been higher recently. It hit 6,867 last month (but fell back before the close of trading) Back on Wall Street, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index is trading at a 14-year high, up 1% at 4,309 points. And the S&amp;P 500 remains at its all-time high, up 21 points or 1.2% at 1,858. This helped to push shares up in Europe, driving the FTSE 100 to its 14-year closing high. Matthew Keator, partner at wealth management firm Keator Group, told Reuters that: People are recognizing that while some economic data has been muted, there is still a lot of value in the market based on corporate cash positions and multiples. From a perspective of overall fundamentals, things look pretty good, especially relative to other asset classes. A spurt of merger activity is driving confidence up. Earlier today, RF Micro Devices agreed a $1.6bn deal to buy Triquint Semiconductor. In Europe, we had the news that Dixons and Carphone Warehouse were talking about a possible merger. And only last week, Facebook announced the huge $19bn takeover of WhatsApp. Paul Radeke, vice president at the Minneapolis-based KDV Wealth Management, reckons this \u201cmerger activity is a good sign for a continued growth market\u201d. But it\u2019s worth remembering that today\u2019s economic data was mixed. While German business confidence rose (details), there was signs of a slowdown in China\u2019s property prices -- suggesting lenders were tightening lending. Veteran analyst David Buik reckons investors have reason for caution.... You would be forgiven for thinking that the Chinese data on property lending was discouraging enough for equities in Europe to pause for reflection. There is no US data to worry about and we have to wait until Thursday before UK GDP numbers are posted. Despite the rather anaemic data of last week in the US, the Street of Dreams refuses to be downhearted. Britain\u2019s index of leading shares has just hit its highest closing levels since 1999, as today\u2019s rally on Wall Street rippled back to Europe. The FTSE 100 closed at 6865, up 27 points, beating the closing high of mid-January. Traders were cheered by the news that the S&amp;P had hit an alltime high today. A strong performance by Bunzl, which jumped 6.8% after reporting a jump in profits and revenues, helped the FTSE shrug off HSBC weakness (it fell 2.8% after missing analyst expectations this morning). The news early today that Chinese house price growth was slowing has been shaken off, as Alistair McCaig of IG explains: Markets have recovered from the disappointment of Chinese housing figures. Although this potential bubble has not yet burst, it does appear that some of the hot air has escaped. McCaig is reluctant to credit the G20 finance ministers meeting for sparking the rally: This weekend\u2019s promise from the G20 that it will pump $2 trillion into the global economy, while avoiding any specifics as to how it will achieve this, has done little to stimulate traders who have heard this patter before. HSBC\u2019s decision to give its senior staff \u201cfixed pay allowances\u201d to dodge the EU bonus cap, and to pay 239 staff at least \u00a31m, continues to reverberate in the City and beyond. Andrew Tyrie MP, who heads the Treasury committee, says the news shows how a \u2018crude bonus cap\u2019 cannot work. Rewards need to be much better matched to the maturity of the risk. People should receive rewards only when it is clear that they have been earned. \u201cHigher salary and lower bonuses take bank remuneration in the opposite direction. City analyst Louise Cooper argues, though, the HSBC\u2019s bonuses are more defendable than those of Barclays, where investment bankers cashed in despite FALLING profits. For the HSBC Global Banking and Markets division, total bonus payments were the same as 2012 at $1.3bn, but profit was actually up significantly in this division from $7.9bn to $9bn. Such numbers put Barclays Bonus payments to shame and suggests that Anthony Jenkins has been \u201chad\u201d by his investment bankers (where profits were down yet bonuses up). The total variable pay pool across HSBC group is up 5% from $3.7bn to $3.9bn, in the context of Group reported pre tax profit up 9%. HSBC did not repeat the Barclays mistake of paying staff more than shareholders. HSBC paid out a total $9.2bn to its shareholders in 2013 in the form of dividends, well over twice as large as the total bonus pool. My colleague Nils Pratley is seriously unimpressed, though -- saying HSBC has basically told the EU where it can put its bonus cap. \u201cDear shareholder, this new EU law capping bonuses is silly so we\u2019ve decided to exploit the enormous and very obvious loophole. Stuff Brussels: we\u2019re not paying ourselves less. Your co-operation in this matter is greatly appreciated.\u201d HSBC\u2019s message on bonus-capping: stuff you, Brussels It\u2019s nearly a year since Cyprus became the latest member of the eurozone to accept a bailout, and was promptly plunged into a world of bank closures, capital controls, rising unemployment and deep recession. And now, president Nicos Anastasiades has spoken about the shock he felt when eurozone leaders told him that he had to accept a rescue package in which Cyprus\u2019s banks - and their savers - would contribute billions of euros. He was speaking to Helena Smith, who reports: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to renege on what I had promised,\u201d said Anastasiades, admitting that it felt as if he had a gun to his head as he weighed the dilemma of accepting such draconian measures or the prospect of bankruptcy and state collapse. Speaking in Nicosia\u2019s sandstone colonial-era presidential palace, he said: \u201cThe idea had come to mature as much within the IMF as European mechanisms that \u2026 a banking crisis had to be solved with their own means, and the first who were judged to be a suitable guinea pig \u2013 because we are a small economy and small country and not systemic for the rest of Europe \u2013 was Cyprus.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Cyprus weathers a financial hurricane \u2013 one year on Speaking of central banks... the central bank governor of Ukraine has resigned today following the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovich. Ihor Sorkin will be replaced by Stepan Kubiv, an MP who was a commandant in the Maidan protests: Kubiv has served as deputy chairman of the Committee on Finance and Banking in the Ukraine parliament. Earlier today the Ukraine government issued an arrest warrant for Yanukovich, for the \u201cmass murder\u201d of peaceful citizens. Our Ukraine liveblog has all the details. Israel\u2019s central bank has just surprised the markets by cutting interest rates, from 1% to 0.75%. The Bank of Israel cited weak consumer confidence, benign domestic inflation, disappointing recent US economic data and slow growth and deflation fears in Europe. The full transcript of prime minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s speech to the Italian senate is now online, here. As flagged up earlier, Renzi said he wants to agree political reforms by the end of March, promised a \u201cdouble-digit reduction of the tax wedge\u201d, and spoke about spending many billions of euros on school infrastructure. Renzi also vowed to reform and speed up the Italian civil justice system, citing the death of a young man in Florence in a car accident during his time as mayor. Although drink and drugs were apparently involved, the driver eventually only faced a small fine, Renzi said. With many thanks to Italian political analyst Alberto Nardelli, of Electionista, who flags up that the speech did not actually include firm, detailed new fiscal plans. Entertainingly, the transcript includes the heckling from opposition groups such as the radical Five Star Movement (Google translate gives the general gist). America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index has just hit a fresh all-time high, bursting over the 1,851 point mark to claw back its losses at the start of 2014. The Dow is now rallying too, up 133 points, as Wall Street shakes off the worries about a clampdown on China\u2019s property market. There\u2019s not much calm in the eBay boardroom, I fancy, after activist shareholder Carl Icahn took another swing at the company. Icahn used his favourite weapon, the shareholder letter, to repeat his call that eBay should spin off its Paypal arm. He also attacked several eBay board members. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen is savaged for his role in a consortium which bought 70% of internet telephony service Skype from eBay in 2009, pre-empting plans to float it on the stock market. In a bid to get two supporters onto eBay\u2019s board, Icahn wrote: A mere 18 months later, Mr. Andreessen\u2019s investor group flipped Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion, a value three times what they paid for it, netting approximately $4 billion at the expense of eBay stockholders. Icahn also criticised Andressen and fellow board member Scott Cook for investing in eBay competitors. And he claimed that CEO John Donahoe was \u201ccomplacent\u201d and \u201cmyopic\u201d in his running of the company. Forbes has the full letter. Anyway, eBay has swiftly hit back -- dubbing Icahn a new shareholder who has \u201ccherry-picked old news clips and anecdotes out of context\u201d. eBay also firmly denied allegations of wrong-doing, declaring: Marc Andreessen and Scott Cook bring extraordinary insight, expertise and leadership to eBay\u2019s board, which is scrupulous in its governance practices and fully transparent with regard to its directors\u2019 other affiliations and businesses. And eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe is widely respected for his turnaround of eBay and leadership of the company over the past six years. Here\u2019s eBay\u2019s full response. A calm start to trading on Wall Street has sent the Dow Jones index up 77 points, or +0.5%, to 16180. Reuters has snapped the key points from Matteo Renzi\u2019s speech - including that he wants to debate political reforms to eliminate the Senate\u2019s role as a lawmaking body by the end of next month. ITALY PM RENZI SAYS AIMS TO FREE UP BILLIONS OF EUROS TO INVEST IN SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE ITALY PM RENZI SAYS WILL PAY OFF ALL ARREARS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THROUGH DIFFERENT USE OF STATE HOLDING COMPANY CDP ITALY PM RENZI SAYS WILL SET UP GUARANTEE FUND FOR SMALL COMPANIES ITALY PM RENZI SAYS WILL CUT TAX WEDGE BY DOUBLE DIGIT FIGURE IN FIRST HALF OF 2014, BY MEASURES INCLUDING SPENDING CUTS ITALY PM RENZI SAYS WILL BOOST WELFARE FOR UNEMPLOYED ITALY PM RENZI SAYS AIMS FOR COMPREHENSIVE JUSTICE REFORM PACKET IN JUNE ITALY PM RENZI SAYS SAYS WANTS TO HAVE REFORM OF SENATE AND REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS AGREED BY END MARCH Italy\u2019s new prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is promising to implement electoral reform, invest billions of euros in new educational infrastructure and trim taxes, in a speech to the Senate. Speaking ahead of a confidence vote to cement his position as PM, Renzi told MPs that he would not tear up an agreement with the centre-right parties to overhaul Italy\u2019s election laws. He said We will respect the timing and modality that were agreed. He also declared that he wants to be the \u201clast PM who has to ask this chamber for vote of confidence\u201d -- a reference to plans to curb the upper house\u2019s control over legislation. Amid heckling and laughter from opposition MPs, Renzi reminded them that Italy\u2019s GDP had shrunk by 9% since the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the global downturn -- that\u2019s a collapse, not merely a crisis, he said. Fresh from forcing his predecessor, Enrico Letta, out of office, Renzi pledged double-digit cuts to Italy\u2019s \u201ctax wedge\u201d (labour taxes which take around 47% out of the average take-home pay). Renzi promised to reform the Italian justice system, and urged parliament to tackle Italy\u2019s debt and growth problems, saying reform was in its own interests. And he promised to publish details of public spending online, to improve accountability and transparency. The gold price has risen to a three-month high today. It indicates that traders remain worried about economic growth prospects despite G20 finance ministers pledging yesterday to conjure up an extra $2tn of output by 2019. Gold is changing hands at $1,333 per ounce, up from $1,323 on Friday, the highest level since the end of October 2013. Worries about China\u2019s economy, following the slowing in house price growth, are being blamed, with Quantitative Commodity Research owner Peter Fertig saying: \u201cFears about economic conditions in China and the U.S. are driving investors back into gold\u201d. In Cyprus, riot police have clashed with electricity workers during anti-austerity demonstrations outside the country\u2019s parliament this morning. Hundreds of workers from the state-owned EAC electricity operator massed outside the parliament building in Nicosia, as MPs prepared to debate a bill to privatise it, the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority and the Cyprus Ports authority. The plan is part of Cyprus\u2019s bailout agreement with international lenders, hammered out nearly a year ago. It must raise \u20ac1.4bn through privatisations by 2018. Associated Press reports that there were scuffles, but no arrests. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s take: Angry electricity authority workers in Cyprus pelted parliament with fruit and rocks during a strike on Monday to protest government plans to privatize the state-run organization. Workers from the Electricity Authority of Cyprus gathered outside parliament as lawmakers prepared to discuss a bill on privatizing the EAC as well as the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority and the Cyprus Ports authority. Riot police scuffled with protesters, but there were no immediate reports of arrests. The workers have announced a 12-hour stoppage. The government has pledged to its international creditors that it will have passed the bill by March 5. The Cyprus News Agency said scuffles broke out with police when protesters tried to push past the police barricade in an attempt to enter parliament. Privatizing state-run companies is part of Cyprus\u2019 10 billion euro ($13.7 billion) international bailout agreement reached last year. The deal saw authorities seize large portions of uninsured savings in the two largest banks and impose capital controls. Back to the eurozone -- and today\u2019s inflation data has not calmed fears that Europe is slumping into a Japan-style deflation trap. As mentioned at 10.05am, consumer prices rose by just 0.8% on an annual basis in January. They slumped by an alarming 1.1% month-on-month. Three countries are now suffering deflation -- Cyprus, Greece and Bulgaria, where prices fell at least 1.3% year-on-year. The UK has the joint-highest rate, at +1.9%. Jonathan Pryor, head of FX Dealing at Investec, says the European Central Bank needs to do more to stimulate economic activity across the eurozone. With headline borrowing costs already close to zero, more unorthodox measures are needed, he says: At 0.8% the CPI number is marginally higher than the expected 0.7% but it\u2019s still far too close for comfort when price stability is so important. The number might support the euro to an extent but it\u2019s far too low for the ECB to rule out reconsidering the existing liquidity measures. If anything this is likely to prompt new extraordinary measures, with very little room to manoeuvre in the 0.25% bank rate. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says it\u2019s \u2018touch and go\u2019 whether the ECB will take fresh action at next month\u2019s governing council meeting. He believes Mario Draghi is most likely to announce measure to increase liquidity in the eurozone economy: This may very well involve the ECB stopping sterilizing the money it spent buying sovereign bonds during the euro zone\u2019s debt crisis under its now-terminated Securities Markets Program (SMP). The ECB could also do another Long-Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) which may be tailored specifically towards lifting bank lending to the private sector. Dixons shares are now up 10% as investors cheer the prospect of a merger with Carphone Warehouse (see 10.19am onwards for details and reaction). Carphone are up 2.2%. Jobs could be at risk if Dixons and Carphone Warehouse hammer out a merger. Our retail correspondent Zoe Wood warns: There is likely to be scope for considerable cost cutting if the two businesses are combined. Dixons, with 1,154 stores, employs 31,000 people in 12 countries. Last year the Hemel Hempstead-based group had sales of \u00a38.2bn. Both retailers are grappling with structural changes in their industries as sales move online and manufacturers such as Apple dominate the handset market. Here\u2019s Zoe\u2019s story: Dixons and Carphone Warehouse in \u00a33.5bn merger talks Campaigners for a financial transaction tax have laid into HSBC for dodging the EU\u2019s bonus cap by paying huge \u2018fixed pay allowances\u2019 to senior staff, such as CEO Stuart Gulliver (see here). Robin Hood campaign spokesperson David Hillman sounded wearily angry over the bank\u2019s antics, saying: \u201cIt is all so depressingly familiar - another set of bank results and another set of outrageous payouts. There is something seriously wrong when Britain\u2019s biggest bank can hand out \u00a31m plus packages to hundreds of staff while the rest of us are still paying the price of the financial crisis. \u201cHSBC haven\u2019t so much circumvented rules on bonuses as driven a coach and horses through them. The only way to rein in bankers\u2019 remuneration is to make banks pay their fair share to society.\u201d As covered earlier, a total of 239 HSBC staff were paid at least \u00a31m last year, with the total bonus pool up by 6% to $3.9bn. The opposition Labour Party argues that this bonus splurge is the latest proof that the UK government has failed to tackle bank pay. Cathy Jamieson MP, Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cWe\u2019re once again seeing bumper pay-outs with bonuses up this year at Lloyds, Barclays and now HSBC. \u201cThe government should be repeating Labour\u2019s successful bank bonus tax this year. This could fund a paid job for every young person out of work for 12 months or more, which they would have to take up or lose benefits. \u201cLabour\u2019s plan will help us earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top. And we will balance the books in the next Parliament, but do so in a fairer way by reversing David Cameron\u2019s \u00a33 billion tax giveaway for the top one per cent of earners.\u201d Reuters flags up that Dixons has long coveted a bigger role in the mobile technology world. It has abandoned unprofitable operations recently, while Carphone has shrugged off weak sales in France: Shares in Dixons, which trails Metro\u2019s Media-Saturn by annual sales, have increased 74% over the last year as it has increasingly focused on markets where it has a leading \u201cmulti-channel\u201d position with a combined stores and internet business. Over the last six months the firm has offloaded the loss-making e-commerce business PIXmania and operations in Turkey and partially exited Italy. Chief executive Seb James has made no secret of his desire to increase the firm\u2019s exposure to mobile phones. Carphone Warehouse\u2019s share price has risen 51% over the past year as strong demand for smartphones and tablets in Britain has offset weakness in France. Financial analysts are excited and intrigued by the prospect of Dixons and Carphone merging, saying it could shake up the way consumers are offered mobile technology. Ben Wood of CCS Insight reckons it would dramatically change the mobile market in the UK. Here\u2019s some early reaction: If the Dixons-Carphone Warehouse deal comes off, it would create a major player in the European retail world. Dixons Retail is the second-largest electrical chain in the region, running Currys and PC World stores, as well as its Travel outlets at major airports. Carphone is the largest independent mobile phone retailer in Europe, with more than 2,000 stores. Dixons Retail shares have jumped almost 6%, gaining 2.8p to 50p. Carphone Warehouse is up 2%. The two companies have until 5pm on March 24 to decide whether to press on with a transaction, or walk away from each other. Big excitement in the world of UK retail -- Dixons and Carphone Warehouse have announced they are in talks about a possible \u00a33.5bn merger. The two firms just told the City that they\u2019re conducting \u201cpreliminary discussions\u201d, adding: These discussions are at a very preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that a transaction will be forthcoming. No decision has been reached regarding the structuring of any such merger. Accordingly until further notice, for the purposes of the Code, both Dixons and Carphone Warehouse will be treated as offeree companies. After some rocky times, Dixons appears to be in good shape - posting a 5% rise in like-for-like sales over Christmas. Carphone, which recently ended a partnership with Best Buy, cheered the City last month with a contract to create 60 stores for Samsung. There have been rumours of a possible deal for a while, but today\u2019s announcement was prompted by a blogpost by financial journalist Ben Harrington. He reported this morning that talks between the two sides had reached \u201ca relatively advanced stage.\u201d: Carphone Warehouse in merger talks with Dixons to create \u00a33.5bn electrical goods giant Annual inflation in the euro area in January was 0.8%, Eurostat just announced, unchanged from December. That\u2019s a little higher than the \u2018flash\u2019 estimate of 0.7%, but still well below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just below 2%. Prices shrank by 1.1% on a month-on-month basis (in line with initial estimates). Core inflation (stripping out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco) was also just 0.8% year-on-year -- or minus 1.7% on a month-on-month basis. More to follow.... Spanish bank shares are rallying this morning, pushing the IBEX up around 0.6%. That follows Moody\u2019s decision on Friday night to raise Spain\u2019s credit rating by one notch to Baa2. There\u2019s even a cherry on the top -- Moody\u2019s put a \u2018positive outlook\u2019 on Spain\u2019s rating, underlining how the eurozone crisis has eased. As suspected, the G20\u2019s growth pledge isn\u2019t causing much jubilation among European traders today. HSBC (-4%) is the biggest faller in London, followed by insurance firm RSA, which has dropped 2.5% after telling shareholders it might hold a rights issue to patch up its finances. That\u2019s knocked 26 points off the FTSE 100, down 0.4% at 6811. The German DAX has crept up 0.17%, while the French CAC is up 0.2%. HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver is defending the bank\u2019s efforts to dodge the EU\u2019s bonus cap by handing whopping fixed-pay allowances to senior executives (including an extra \u00a31.7m for Gulliver himself). He told banking correspondents that HSBC didn\u2019t want to do it (and yet...), and also rejected the suggestion that it might shift its HQ out of Europe to avoid meddling from Brussels. Jill is tweeting the key points: Back to HSBC -- its shares have fallen by over 4% this morning as the City digests this morning\u2019s financial results, and the news that profits (up 9% to $22.5bn) has missed expectations. Here\u2019s our early news story: HSBC hands 239 bankers \u00a31m-plus as it prepares for EU bonus cap They\u2019re giving a conference call now.... Carsten Brzeski, analyst at ING, says today\u2019s rise in German business optimism (9.15am) shows the country is striding away from the rest of the global economy. He writes: German business optimism seems to be contagious and slowly but surely the latest conundrum between soft and hard data is fading away. Better-than-expected GDP data in the fourth quarter marked an important first step, hard data in the coming weeks should confirm the catching up of the real economy. Brzeski is also not too worried about emerging markets: As long as China remains relatively stable, German exports should remain relatively unharmed. India, Brazil, Turkey and Argentina are not more important as export destinations than Belgium. While some performances of Germany\u2019s Olympic athletes over the last two weeks might have disappointed, the economy\u2019s performance is again en route for a gold medal*. * Although not this quickly German business leaders are more upbeat about business conditions than at any time since July 2011, as the mood in Europe\u2019s largest economy continues to improve . The latest IFO survey, just released, showed a rise in the business climate index to 111.3, up from 106.6 -- that\u2019s the highest in over two and a half years. The IFO institute reported that German firms are benefitting from high demand for their exports. However, there are some worries over volatility in emerging markets (which pushed IFO\u2019s \u2018future expectations\u2019 measure down a little). It\u2019s all change at parenting chain Mothercare -- chief executive Simon Calver has \u201cresigned with immediate effect\u201d. The move comes six weeks after a shocker of a profit warning, which showed Mothercare has struggled over Christmas in the face of tough competition from web retailers and supermarkets. Calver, former boss of online movie rental firm Lovefilm, had only joined Mothercare in April 2014. Analysts had hoped he would drive its e-commerce activities and lead an international expansion, but last months results showed the firm was still struggling. No word from Calver himself - but he\u2019ll walk away with almost \u00a3300,000 in salary and pension payments. More here: Mothercare chief executive quits Banking giant HSBC has reported a 9% rise in annual profits for the last year -- which means 239 staff have walked away with pay packets above \u00a31m. HSBC made a pre-tax profit of $22.6bn -- below expectations, but up from $20.6bn for 2012. This morning\u2019s results also showed a rise in the number of staff taking home at least \u00a31m -- to 239, up from 203 a year ago. And, as suspected, the bank\u2019s CEO is receiving an additional allowance of \u00a31.7m. This means Stuart Gulliver will dodge Europe\u2019s bonus cap (which bans bonuses of more than 200% of base salary, even if shareholders agree) As we reported in this morning\u2019s paper, the decision to award share payouts in lieu of bonuses will reignite anger over efforts to curb City pay. HSBC payouts to reopen EU bonus cap row Dr Pippa Malmgren, president of Principalis Asset Management, reckons G20 meetings have become less relevant as a place where big decisions are made. When there\u2019s a crisis, the G20 is not where it\u2019s resolved, she told Bloomberg TV this morning. Instead, after a crisis has calmed, the G20 is where politicians and central bankers say they\u2019ll maintain the steps taken at the time. Andy Mukherjee of Reuters puts his finger on the problem with the G20 growth pledge -- they\u2019re not talking enough about stimulating demand. He writes: The growth target, adopted at a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Sydney over the weekend, was lifted from an International Monetary Fund paper which examined what might happen if the world\u2019s biggest economies agree on a shared agenda. The IMF researchers recommend shuffling consumption and investment between China, Germany, Brazil, India, Indonesia and the United States. They also advocate carefully fixing fiscal deficits, while changing regulations to boost employment and make both labour and capital more productive. Put it all together, and the researchers reckon the policies should add $2.25 trillion to the IMF\u2019s recent estimate of real output in 2018. Yet the G20\u2019s enthusiastic endorsement of a plan to boost output lacked any clues about who will buy all this extra stuff. More here: G20\u2019s growth pledge is missing a demand booster We\u2019ll have to wait months for more details too -- G20 leaders will present detailed plans at their next summit in Brisbane, in November. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. A pledge from world finance ministers and central bankers to create an extra $2 trillion worth of economic activity over the next five years is failing to cheer global investors today, as fears over the Chinese economy gather pace. Finance chiefs, who had gathered in Sydney for the G20 summit, vowed yesterday to lift their collective GDP by at least an extra 2% over the next five years. They claimed the plan would raise employment worldwide, declaring: To achieve this we will take concrete actions across the G20, including to increase investment, lift employment and participation, enhance trade and promote competition, in addition to macroeconomic policies. More here: G20 vows to find $2tn for global economy But while the G20 promised to work together on \u201cambitious but realistic policies\u201d to stimulate output , it doesn\u2019t (yet, at least) add up to a credible plan to drag the world economy forward. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities dubbed it an \u201c ill-defined pledge\u201d, at a time when analysts are split over the state of Western economies. Will they bounce back from the effect of bad winter weather, or is the underlying picture weak? Ostwald suggests: One might argue that the G20 pledge to boost growth, which lacked any meaningful detail (i.e. representing \u2018fine words\u2019 to paper over the enormous divergence of interests) is an implicit admission that favours the latter explanation. Worrying, if so, at a time when the US Federal Reserve is winding back its stimulus, growth remains weak in Europe, and real wages are still falling in the UK. Michael Hewson of CMC sums up the sense of disappointment: Unfortunately this G20 policy of jam tomorrow won\u2019t solve the more immediate problem in Europe which is one of declining prices and weak economic growth. The markets are reacting with a shrug -- there\u2019s no sign of a rally in Asia today, and the main European markets are tipped to fall back a little too. Investors are particularly worried about overnight data from China showing that property price growth is slowing, which adds to fears that banks are getting tougher with lenders. That triggered a selloff in China -- shares in Chinese property firms suffered their biggest fall in eight months today, wiping over 2% off the main Shanghai index. It adds to fears that China\u2019s economy is weakening as Beijing tries to tackle bad loans and weak lenders. Stan Shamu of IG commented: China has stolen the limelight with some sharp falls on fresh concerns about the property market and the Chinese yuan. While officials in China continue to urge calm, investors will be concerned about some of the recent disappointing economic releases we\u2019ve received from China. So, an edgy start to the week. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day -- including the latest eurozone inflation data at 10am GMT, and keeping an eye on Italy where the new prime minister, Matteo Renzi, must now win a confidence vote.",

      "bodyText": "The meeting of the G20 finance ministers this past weekend coincided with the release of the OCED\u2019s latest Going for Growth report. Rather nicely for the treasurer, Joe Hockey, the report contained many recommendations that fit his own desires for reform of the Australian economy, such as reduced regulations and lower company tax. But the solutions for higher economic growth are not uncontroversial and also require the government to decide how concerned it is about measures that might increase inequality. The OECD report acknowledges that among OECD member nations, just as with the members of the G20, a one-size-fits-all approach doesn\u2019t work. It thus places each member economy into groups based on their strengths and weaknesses. Australia is in a group with Canada, New Zealand, the UK, USA and Switzerland, which all share the problem of low productivity growth despite relatively high investment in knowledge based capital. The OECD prescribes five treatments to improve our economic wellbeing. Two relate to education and research \u2013 improving incentives for research, and funding for child-care \u2013 and one relates to making foreign direct investment easier through reducing \u201cscreening procedures\u201d. The recent blocking of US company ADM\u2019s takeover of Graincorp is a case that the OECD would wish to see reversed. The remaining two recommendations are slightly more controversial. The first suggests that infrastructure efficiency is improved \u201cby expanding user and congestion charges in transport\u201d. When a discussion about introducing a congestion charge was last mooted in 2011, the tabloids ran hard against it. The Daily Telegraph, for example, called it \u201chighway robbery\u201d and \u201cGreens inspired pain\u201d. So it will require a courageous treasurer to suggest such a move. The final OECD recommendation involves taxation. It argues that Australia should reduce our \u201ccomparatively high headline company tax rate\u201d and that we should rely more on indirect taxes such as the GST. And, certainly, our company tax rate is among the highest in the OECD: But where the real difference lies is the importance of the company tax, and this is where Australia leaps further up the table. Of all nations in the OECD, we rank third in the amount of company tax revenue we raise as a percentage of our GDP. While we are less highly ranked on income tax revenue, what is really striking is how little we raise through value-added taxes \u2013 like our GST.

And, given Japan\u2019s consumption tax is about to rise from 5% to 8%, pretty soon we\u2019ll be the lowest. There are two reasons why the OECD suggests lowering the company tax and raising the GST. The first is the belief that lowering the company tax rate will increase business investment and increase GDP growth. In 2012, the Business Tax Working Group estimated that a one percentage point drop in the company tax rate could add 0.2% to GDP growth over the long term.

These measures were massively fought by business groups at the time, and no doubt they would do the same were the many business tax exemptions or billions of dollars in government assistance removed. The Henry Tax Review had argued to cut the rate to 25% \u2013 but it specifically noted that \u201cimproved arrangements for charging for the use of [non-renewable] resources should be introduced at the same time\u201d through \u201ca broad-based resource rent tax\u201d. Good luck finding mention of that in any speech by Joe Hockey. But the other reason for shifting from less corporate tax to more GST-style tax is certainty. Australia has three main taxes: individual income tax, company tax, and the GST. Of the three, company tax varies the most wildly.

      "bodyText": "Bank of England officials have been talking up the strength of the UK recovery as the latest round of business surveys show rising confidence and the FTSE 100 closes in on a record high. Ahead of the publication of official data this week that is expected to confirm robust growth, Bank governor Mark Carney highlighted Britain's lead over other major economies after he attended the G20 summit in Sydney. With the FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares about 100 points off an all-time high set 14 years ago, Carney sought to give much of the credit for the UK's recovery to his forward guidance policy. Under that scheme he had vowed not to consider an interest rate rise at least until unemployment fell to 7%. The jobless rate has come down faster than the Bank expected and in the face of criticism Carney overhauled the policy earlier this month. The UK's recovery has been more rapid than most economists would have expected this time last year, when the ratings agency Moody's delivered a blow to the chancellor, George Osborne, by stripping the country of its top AAA credit score. But the latest release of GDP data on Wednesday \u2013 expected to confirm a 0.7% expansion in the fourth quarter \u2013 will be scrutinised for any slowdown in the consumer spending that has been fuelling growth. The governor defended his first six months at the Bank as having shored up confidence with forward guidance. He told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that it was \"hard to find a criteria by which you would not judge it successful\". Carney, who was in Australia for the G20 meetings which ended with a pledge to bolster global growth by two percentage points, said: \"I met over 700 businesses and the message went through loud and clear: it made them more keen to hire, and more keen to invest. We are now the fastest-growing major economy, we have the fastest employment growth on record, inflation back at target, and inflation expectations well anchored.\" Carney's fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Ben Broadbent said that \"after five years in which the UK economy has looked very sick, it is finally moving out of intensive care\". Writing in the Sunday Times, Broadbent said: \"Few expected the economy to grow as quickly as it did last year. It is reasonable to expect both a continued recovery and, after a difficult few years, growth in real wages as well.\" There is still some way to go before the economy gets back to where it was before the global financial crisis and there have been questions too \u2013 including from the government's own independent forecasters at the Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 about the sustainability of a recovery largely fuelled by consumer spending. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said Wednesday's data might show that consumer spending growth slowed as households continued to grapple with squeezed budgets. Stock market analysts predict further gains ahead for the FTSE 100, which at a Friday close of 6838.06 is nearing its record close of 6930 on 30 December 1999, the height of the dotcom boom. After their strongest week since last summer, leading shares will get another boost this week as a \u00a349bn cash-and-share payout from Vodafone starts to reach investors' pockets. There are tentative signs that growing confidence in the economy is encouraging businesses to invest again, a development that policymakers say is vital to securing the recovery. Business surveys (mon)on Monday will bolster hopes that hiring and investment are improving. A report from business lobby group the CBI suggests optimism in the dominant services sector is rising at the fastest pace for more than a decade. The pick-up in confidence was widespread across the sector, from hotels and travel firms to accountants and lawyers, the survey of 139 firms said. Business volumes rose at the fastest pace since 2005 and profitability improved for the first time since 2007. Companies also said they planned more capital spending in the next 12 months.",
