We may also have conquered the national hang-up about government intervening to support business. And, on paper, there is now official acknowledgment that the geographically lop-sized state of the UK economy, and our historical underinvestment in infrastructure, are major sources of our woeful productivity performance. In other words, there is much to like the white paper, even if the actual sums of new money to be put behind the new approach remain anybody\u2019s guess. As with January\u2019s green paper, too many existing polices were shoehorned into the document and presented as if they were fresh. Still, the future priority is consistent policy-making. On that score, there are reasons to be optimistic. The Institute for Government pointed out in its All Change report this year that the UK has had three industrial strategies in the past 15 years. The churn in policy-making has been caused, in large part, by disagreements about the relationship between industry and government. Sajid Javid, Greg Clark\u2019s immediate predecessor, tended to be sniffy about industrial strategies (or, at least, anything that smelled like picking winners) and mostly saw government\u2019s role as being one of deregulating and clearing obstacles to growth. Clark and Theresa May\u2019s approach may mark the definitive moment when the UK decides to be interventionist. If so, that is very welcome. The new \u201csector deals\u201d \u2013 in effect, collaborations between government and the private sector \u2013 really only acknowledge that other countries have taken a similar line for years. In fact, when its back is against the wall, so has the UK: without inducements for foreign investors, the car sector could have died with British Leyland. And, in a sector such as life sciences, where one of the new deals has already been struck, it would be ridiculous to ignore ties between public and private sectors. The UK has done well in pharmaceuticals partly because of the existence of the NHS and top-class universities. Will the new approach last, though? Alarmingly, the single biggest innovation in the 255-page document received only a half a dozen sentences. It was the creation of a new independent body to measure progress in the grand effort to retool the UK economy. Such a body will exist \u2013 it will be called the Industrial Strategy Council \u2013 but Clark offered few details beyond the fact that would be be \u201cdrawn from leading business men and women, investors, economists and academics from across the UK\u201d and would have access to government data. That tells us next to nothing about the new council\u2019s standing in Westminster and Whitehall. The CBI had lobbied for an organisation with the status of the Office for Budget Responsibility and the government, it seemed, had encouraged the idea that was on cards. If so, it\u2019s not the white paper in solid form. Dr Craig Berry, from the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute and a member of the independent Industrial Strategy Commission, is right to worry that \u201cthe proposed advisory council falls short of the OBR-style monitoring body required to embed industrial strategy into the routine agendas of future governments\u201d. The concern will be that Treasury and the business department are not acting in unison. Clark and May need to address the point urgently. Yes, a round of consultation may required since, from a technical perspective, measuring the success of an industrial strategy is a tougher gig than the work done by the OBR. But the credibility of the new strategy hinges on how the government will be held to account. Get the body established quickly and agree its targets. Good intentions are never enough. Home truths for Persimmon If you dig as far as page 104 of Persimmon\u2019s last annual report, you will find the housebuilder admit it has received \u201cindirect assistance\u201d from the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme. You bet. Persimmon has prospered so merrily that the chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, will receive a \u00a350m tranche of shares in the new year via a 2012 incentive scheme, with \u00a340m to follow at the current share price. It\u2019s up to individuals whether to accept all their windfall or donate a decent whack to charity. But it would be nice if Persimmon\u2019s board admitted that its 2012 scheme, by not capping rewards, was appallingly designed.

    "webTitle": "Business leaders urge government to create productivity watchdog", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Business leaders have warned that the government\u2019s new industrial strategy risks being blown off course unless ministers create a powerful independent watchdog to monitor progress in boosting Britain\u2019s weak productivity. While welcoming a white paper detailing five areas where the UK\u2019s economic performance needs to improve, employers\u2019 groups said it was vital Greg Clark, the business secretary, gave \u201cteeth\u201d to a planned advisory council. Trade unions called for the government to ensure that workers were represented on the watchdog, which Clark has said will be modelled on the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the body that provides economic forecasts for the Treasury. Labour said the white paper was made up of re-announced policies and old spending commitments, while Michael Heseltine, the former Conservative business secretary, said the best industrial strategy would be to call a halt to Brexit. In a forward to the white paper, Theresa May said the proposals would help \u201cbuild a Britain fit for the future\u201d after its departure from the EU. The industrial strategy emphasises five areas for attention: innovation, infrastructure, skills, spreading prosperity across the country, and ensuring that businesses have access to finance. Clark also said the government was keen to forge partnerships between Whitehall, the private sector and universities in sectors seen as having particular importance to the economy in the future. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said businesses welcomed the ambition to turn around the UK\u2019s \u201cwoeful productivity\u201d but said the industrial strategy would only be the beginning of a new bold approach if it was followed through in successive parliaments. \u201cNow more than ever, the public and private sector need to join forces on this long-term vision that targets all dimensions of the UK economy \u2013 people, place and business. In a moment of heightened political volatility, much will depend on whether there will be a guardian of industrial strategy to shield it from the rigours of a short-termist political cycle. If this is to be the new independent industrial strategy council, it must be given the necessary teeth for the task.\u201d Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: \u201cThe CBI has long made the case for an independent body to get to grips with monitoring and measuring the success of this roll-out. This will allow for frank and honest assessments that would help avoid the trap of the industrial strategy becoming a political football. \u201cIf the industrial strategy council is to have real teeth then it needs to have clear measurements and metrics to judge the success or failure of the strategy.\u201d Clark is to consult over the shape and powers of the industrial strategy council, but has been won over to the idea that a body based on the OBR is the right approach. But Craig Berry, deputy director of the political economy research institute at the University of Sheffield, and a commissioner on the independent industrial strategy commission, expressed concern that the watchdog would not be strong enough. \u201cA genuinely long-term strategy must be overseen at the heart of government. This means the Treasury, not BEIS (the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy). But the two departments seem as far apart as ever. \u201cFurthermore, the proposed advisory council falls short of the OBR-style monitoring body required to embed industrial strategy into the routine agendas of future governments. After the hype fades, we will need to normalise industrial strategy.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cA key reason behind the success of Germany\u2019s industrial strategy is that government, business and unions all sit down together. And plan decades ahead. The UK should be following this blueprint. Unions must be represented on the new industrial strategy council.\u201d Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cNothing in the white paper will help give businesses the certainty or incentives they need to invest in the face of the government\u2019s catastrophic handling of Brexit. \u201cWhat detail there is concentrates on a few elite industries in which Britain already has an advantage, and will do nothing to help the millions of people who work in low productivity and low wage sectors such as retail, hospitality and social care, or those based outside London, Oxford and Cambridge.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "US markets may be hitting new highs but it is a more downbeat picture in Europe. Dollar weakness lifting the euro and the pound has hit the main European markets, while Wall Street is benefiting from the currency movements and investor hopes that the Republicans are making progress with their tax returns. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 25.74 points or 0.35% lower at 7383.90 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.46% to 13,000.20 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.56% at 5360.09 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 22,176.70 But Spain\u2019s Ibex edged up 0.1% to 10,063.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.17% to 724.39 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 26 points or 0.11%. And bitcoin is 2.5% better at $9509. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Oil is on the slide ahead of this Thursday\u2019s meeting of Opec, despite talk that the producers will extend their output cut to try and curb oversupply and protect the price. David Madden at CMC Markets says: WTI and Brent Crude oil are in the red today after having a positive run recently ahead of the OPEC meeting on Thursday. There is speculation that major oil producers will extend the oil production cut until the end of 2018. Some dealers feel a lot of that is already priced in and are exiting their long positions ahead of the meeting in Vienna. The US shale producers will be paying close attention to OPEC\u2019s decision, as a surge in the energy market could prompt higher production in the shale sector \u2013 which could counteract OPEC\u2019s decision. Brent crude is currently down 0.8% at $63.33 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 2% lower at $57.7. Bitcoin, by the way, is currently up 4% at $9647, although down from its earlier peak of $9721. More on the markets. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Another day, another record high in the Dow Jones, which is playing catch-up with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq after those indices hit fresh records last week. Risk appetite remains healthy in the US but subdued in the UK and Europe, and once again it is strength in the home currencies arising from dollar weakness that is helping to stifle what looked like a strong session earlier in the day. The other big worry, particularly for the FTSE 100\u2019s mining contingent, is a notable tightening of financial conditions in China; while rising bond yields might not seem like a reason to worry, a hit to corporate profits could feed through to the broader economy and thus raise questions about demand for raw materials in 2018. The great mining rally has recovered from its wobble in the first half of the year, but assuming demand remains healthy this weakness could be a chance to pick up some big miners on the cheap. US stocks are back to normal today, with the recovery from Thanksgiving overindulgence complete. Tax reform looks a bit less of a done deal today, and it is strange to see the market so blissfully unconcerned. Perhaps it is the thought of a festive rally into year-end that is keeping them stable, or perhaps they\u2019re hoping Mr Trump will pull a rabbit out of the hat. Either way, as we head into the final month of the year a sudden pullback due to tax reform worries offers the dip-buyers their best hope. Earlier the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane gave a speech at a Birmingham school about the importance of economics to the general public: European markets have not been able to keep pace with their US counterparts, and are marginally in the red as we head towards the last hour or so of trading. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Monday\u2019s been a pretty scatty, aimless day of trading, with the European indices reversing their lunchtime reversal. Once again the FTSE finds itself back below 7400, falling 20 points having been up by that same amount at midday (and having been down by that same amount just after the bell). The pound\u2019s 0.1% rise against both the dollar and the euro likely didn\u2019t help, with cable briefly striking a fresh 8 week peak. However the brunt of the FTSE\u2019s decline appears to be coming from the commodity and banking sectors. BP and Shell haven fallen 0.9% apiece as Brent Crude slipped around 1% as it eyes Wednesday\u2019s OPEC meeting, with the miners stranded in a sea of red. The smattering of losses coating the likes of Barclays, Lloyds and RBS, meanwhile, comes ahead of tomorrow\u2019s stress test results. In the Eurozone the DAX and CAX followed the same pattern as the FTSE, flitting in and out of the red before settling at a loss this afternoon. The German index is down 0.1% despite signs of political progress in Germany, while its French peer fell 0.2%. As for the Dow Jones, it surged 0.3% this Cyber Monday, crossing 23600 to hit a brand spanking new all-time peak. For those keeping track, the index has rocketed nearly 20% higher since the start of the year (it\u2019s even more if you trace its rise back to Trump\u2019s election). Following the strong US housing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved sharply higher and has now also hit a new peak. It is now up 0.3% at 23,628. Some strong housing data from the US. New home sales jumped 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 in October, the highest level in ten years. New home sales have increased for three straight months, although September\u2019s figures was revised down from 667,000 to 645,000. Economists had been expected sales to fall 6% to 625,000 in October. No comment: Another day and more records for US markets. Helped by gains for retail shares on Cyber Monday, the S&amp;P 500 has edged up to a new peak of 2604, while the Nasdaq Composite is at a record 6890. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is below the heights reached last week but is still up 0.13% on the day at 23,587. Back with non-cryptocurrencies, and the dollar is slipping back on suggestions that a US rate hike in December may be the last for a while, given last week\u2019s Federal Reserve minutes showed some reluctance to push borrowing costs too high. So the pound has added 0.3% against the US currency to $1.3382, an eight week high. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said of the dollar: While a December rate move remains a done deal in the eyes of the markets, it\u2019s what comes after that which is becoming less clear. There were positive views about the jobs market as well as general economic activity across the board, but there were diverging views about the lack of inflation, and it is this uncertainty about US rate policy in 2018 which continues to undermine the currency against the backdrop of a flattening yield curve. Back in the world of shopping, and US retail companies are seeing share price gains in premarket trading, following Black Friday and during Cyber Monday. JC Penney is up 1.8%, Target is 1% better, Macy\u2019s is 1.1% better and the unstoppable Amazon has added 0.5%. What do central banks think of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bloomberg has done a roundup of views: Eight years since the birth of bitcoin, central banks around the world are increasingly recognizing the potential upsides and downsides of digital currencies. The guardians of the global economy have two sets of issues to address. First is what to do, if anything, about emergence and growth of the private cryptocurrencies that are grabbing more and more attention -- with bitcoin now surging toward $10,000. The second question is whether to issue official versions. The reaction is mixed, with some warning of the dangers while others - including the Bank of England\u2019s Mark Carney - seeing it as a potential revolution. The full report is here. European stock markets are subdued today, following the selloff in China overnight. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, the German DAX and the French CAC are all down by between 0.1 and 0.3%, as the pound and the euro gain against the US dollar. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: European markets are tracking Asia lower, as fears grow that Chinese equities could be starting one of their downward legs, which may cause fright for global investors. Chinese equity markets are notorious for delivering a volatile ride for investors, who have become used to boom and bust periods. The China effect is especially significant for commodity markets and by extension the metal and oil heavy FTSE 100. Investors are also looking for signs of progress in Germany, now that the centre-left SPD party is prepared to consider another coalition with Angela Merkel. After its early morning jump, bitcoin is currently bobbing around the $9,600 mark. That leaves the $10,000 milestone firmly in its sights. And some in the industry reckon this could lure more people into buying digital currencies. Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin Ltd, told Bloomberg: \u201cThe weekend\u2019s bitcoin price hike is just the continuation of a long-term bull run on the cryptocurrency, fueled by the tsunami of speculative trading on Japanese exchanges and the entrance of institutional investors across the world. It is more likely that the $10,000 psychological stratosphere will push more institutional investors into the mix.\u201d Alternatively, Bitcoin\u2019s rapid ascent might force financial authorities and central banks to rethink their current policy of waiting to see how digital currencies evolve. In recent months we\u2019ve seen a boom in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), in which new cryptocurrencies are launched into the market - often backed by a celebrity (yes you, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather). ICOs are already under serious scrutiny, due to fears that investor aren\u2019t properly protected. David Futter, fintech partner at law firm Ashurst, predicts that scrutiny will intensify. In the shorter-term regulatory scrutiny will continue to fall on ICOs and the benefits of adapting the existing financial regulation around investments, payments and e-money to drive even more competition while protecting consumers. \u201cRegulators know the rewards of cryptocurrency and blockchain could be huge, but have more than one eye on the catastrophic ramifications if good governance, stability and control are not preserved. If the carrot of self-regulation proves insufficient, the regulators will not hesitate to use their stick.\u201d Now here\u2019s a thing. Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmining\u201d network uses more electricity in a year than 19 European countries, including Ireland, according to statistics released this morning. That power consumption is the cost of verifying transactions made using bitcoins, as our technology writer Alex Hern explains: At a continual power drain of 3.4GW, it means the network consumes five times more electricity than is produced by the largest wind farm in Europe, the London Array in the outer Thames Estuary, at 630MW.... The astronomical power draw is a facet of how the bitcoin network protects itself against fraud. With no centralised authority confirming transactions, bitcoin is instead backed by \u201cminers\u201d, who put specialised computers to work churning through extremely power-intensive computing problems. Solving those problems both rewards the miner, handing them almost a quarter of a million dollars in bitcoin, and verifies all transactions made in the last 10 minutes. More here: Here\u2019s our news story on Bitcoin\u2019s rally: Speaking of those stress tests, here\u2019s a video explaining how Britain\u2019s banks have been put under the microscope. Tomorrow is a big day for Britain\u2019s banking sector. At 7am, the Bank of England will publish the results of this year\u2019s bank stress tests. They will assess whether UK lenders have enough capital to cope with a sterling crisis, a recession, and a housing market crash. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The Bank of England is to reveal the damage inflicted on the UK\u2019s biggest lenders from \u00a330bn of hypothetical consumer loan losses, an economic downturn and a collapse in the pound. Threadneedle Street\u2019s latest health check on the sector \u2013 the first was conducted in 2014 \u2013 could have an impact on a bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends and on its business models. The lenders could be forced to sell off assets or ask existing shareholders and bondholders for more cash if they fail the tests based on hypothetical scenarios intended to put the sector under severe stress. You can get up to speed with Jill\u2019s preview, here: Bitcoin\u2019s rapid ascent towards $10,000 could spur some investors to cash in their gains, suggests the analyst team at FXPro. They write: Currently, the market is anticipating that Bitcoin will reach $10K, with the lack of warning signals down to the lack of any doubts regarding further growth. It begins to seem that big businesses intended to profit from it. If this happens, there is a huge risk that big players start taking profit, with news provoking panic and sell-off. The cryptocurrency market currently seems like a playground for Wall Street tycoons, with JP Morgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon \u2018looking at business opportunities in the planned Bitcoin-futures market\u2019, albeit having labelled Bitcoin \u2018a fraud\u2019 just two months ago. Once speculation is over, it is very likely that only the real business model projects will remain, such as logistics companies, accountancy or statistics firms reliant on blockchain. There are roughly 16.7 million bitcoins in circulation - that\u2019s the number mined using special software and hardware. Those coins are now worth $160bn in total (if you accept that a currency can have its own market capitalisation), more than some of the world\u2019s major companies. Mike\u2019s got a point... Tarzan* has swung into the debate on Britain\u2019s industrial strategy! Lord Heseltine, former UK deputy prime minister, has argued that the best thing for British business would be to cancel Brexit, rather than Heseltine says it\u2019s simply implausible to expect firms to commit fresh investment while Britain\u2019s future is unclear: Our country is facing years of stagnation, and what is a principal cause of that? It\u2019s that anyone who has got to take an investment decision today is saying, \u2018Well how do I know what to invest in? What\u2019s going to happen about Britain and its biggest market of Europe?\u2019 and so they\u2019re hesitating. Whether they\u2019re British companies or overseas companies investing here, they\u2019re hesitating. And as long as we have this Brexit shadow going over us, that will remain. And what do we get in the Budget? A \u00a33bn bill in order to prepare for this Brexit disaster. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: * - a reference to Lord Heseltine\u2019s impressive mane and exuberant approach to politics (some readers may remember his antics with the House of Commons mace in 1976) This chart, from Bloomberg, shows how bitcoin has soared this year: Some analysts say it looks like an unsustainable bubble. But Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, reckons bitcoin will keep rising as more individuals and investors jump on board. From a fundamental perspective it is still almost impossible to give the cryptocurrency a fair value, however, there has been a strong correlation between the price of Bitcoin and number of users opening new wallets. It is not just retail investors showing interest in the cryptocurrency, but many hedge funds have decided to join the party recently by including Bitcoins in their portfolios. Given that number of users haven\u2019t exceeded 0.1% of the global population, there\u2019s still more potential for this momentum trade to continue. Whether the price will be justified in the foreseeable future, depends on the adoption and the application of the new currency, but so far it still looks unstoppable. Bitcoin\u2019s rally is partly due to the established financial world taking cryptocurrencies more seriously. Last month, derivatives marketplace CME Group announced it will start offering Bitcoin futures in December - letting investors trade Bitcoin without actually buying it. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says this was a key moment: CME\u2019s decision to launch bitcoin futures in December has undoubtedly fuelled buying. BTC is up more than 50% since the decision was announced on October 31st. The legitimacy this gives Bitcoin as a tradeable asset is very important. The market cap of Bitcoin now exceeds that of IBM, Disney and McDonald\u2019s. But traditional investors still find Bitcoin\u2019s rally baffling, with many predicting that it will end in tears. As Wilson puts it: Rather than a commodity or currency, Bitcoin is like owning stock in a company that will only ever issue 21 million shares and never pay a penny in dividends. The only way it has value is if the next guy is willing to pay you more for it \u2013 the greater fool. With no intrinsic value to Bitcoin, it\u2019s hard to see this as anything other than a giant speculative bubble.\u201d Chinese stocks may be sinking, but Bitcoin is on a tear (again) this morning. The crypto currency has hit a fresh record high of $9,600 this morning, putting the $10,000 mark within its sights. It\u2019s quite a rally - Bitcoin started 2017 at just $1,000, before smashing a series of milestones with remarkable speed. Bullish Chinese investors capitulated this morning, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. He writes: China equities are turning lower again, led by financials. This is driven by concerns about rising yields (multi-year highs) amid a bond market sell-off that is likely to raise re-financing costs in an already over leveraged economy, putting pressure on both corporates and consumers, reviving the China credit bubble story. Chinese stocks have hit this lowest level since the summer, as a government crackdown on risky lending spooks investors. The Shanghai composite index fell almost 1% to 3,322 points, the lowest level since 25th August. Traders said jitters in the bond market are hitting Chinese shares, on fears that corporations will pay more to borrow - eating into profits. New curbs on the asset management sector are also driving people to sell, as Reuters explains: Selling in China\u2019s stock markets last week had been prompted by a rout in the bond market that pushed yields on government treasury bonds to three-year highs, and by fresh moves to reduce risks in the asset management industry that may bring a sea change for banks and millions of small investors. But while bond market jitters appeared to ease on Monday, stock market investors continued to unload shares in major firms that have enjoyed strong gains in recent weeks. This could weigh on Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning too.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Weak productivity growth is a key reason why Britain faces years of anaemic growth and weak pay. But the UK government hopes to crack the puzzle today, by announcing a new UK\u2019s Industrial Strategy. It will focus on five \u2018key foundations\u2019 -- ideas, people, infrastructure, business environment and places, in an attempt to make the British economy fit for the 21st century. Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, will launch the strategy this morning. He hopes to make Britain a world leader in areas such as AI and driverless cars. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The paper will identify four grand challenges, global trends that the government sees as shaping the future: artificial intelligence; clean growth; an ageing society; and future mobility from driverless cars to drones. Industrial strategy went out of fashion in the Conservative party after the defeat of the 1974-9 Labour government by Margaret Thatcher. But Clark believes a new approach based on competition rather than on picking winners will help address Britain\u2019s long-term problems. But will it really be enough to spur Britain forwards? Also coming up today... City investors will be watching Germany closely. Over the weekend, senior officials in Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party agreed to pursue a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with the Social Democrats. This could spare Germany from a fresh snap election. Plus, we get a new health check on America\u2019s housing market Here\u2019s the agenda 9.30am GMT: Industrial strategy released 3pm GMT: US new home sales figures for October",

Risk appetite remains healthy in the US but subdued in the UK and Europe, and once again it is strength in the home currencies arising from dollar weakness that is helping to stifle what looked like a strong session earlier in the day. The other big worry, particularly for the FTSE 100\u2019s mining contingent, is a notable tightening of financial conditions in China; while rising bond yields might not seem like a reason to worry, a hit to corporate profits could feed through to the broader economy and thus raise questions about demand for raw materials in 2018. The great mining rally has recovered from its wobble in the first half of the year, but assuming demand remains healthy this weakness could be a chance to pick up some big miners on the cheap.</p> \n   <p>US stocks are back to normal today, with the recovery from Thanksgiving overindulgence complete. Tax reform looks a bit less of a done deal today, and it is strange to see the market so blissfully unconcerned. Perhaps it is the thought of a festive rally into year-end that is keeping them stable, or perhaps they\u2019re hoping Mr Trump will pull a rabbit out of the hat. Either way, as we head into the final month of the year a sudden pullback due to tax reform worries offers the dip-buyers their best hope.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a1c368157470105e9573cd4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-27T16:02:31.817Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane gave a speech at a Birmingham school about the importance of economics to the general public:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/935175997925855232\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In his latest speech our Chief Economist, Andy Haldane, discusses why economics can be a turn-off for most people and how our new approach to \"communication, conversation and education\" aims to tackle that. <a href=\"https://t.co/e9Iq1vSbfG\">https://t.co/e9Iq1vSbfG</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/m2fWrZSe85\">pic.twitter.com/m2fWrZSe85</a></p>\u2014 Bank of England (@bankofengland) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/935175997925855232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 27, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a1c2df99ab3f2056cb1c2e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-27T15:25:17.310Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>European markets have not been able to keep pace with their US counterparts, and are marginally in the red as we head towards the last hour or so of trading.

Solving those problems both rewards the miner, handing them almost a quarter of a million dollars in bitcoin, and verifies all transactions made in the last 10 minutes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More here:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/27/bitcoin-mining-consumes-electricity-ireland\">Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity a year than Ireland</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a1bf1299ab3f2056cb1c05d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-27T11:17:45.382Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s our news story on Bitcoin\u2019s rally:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/27/bitcoin-nears-10000-dollar-mark-as-hedge-funds-plough-in\">Bitcoin nears $10,000 mark as hedge funds plough in</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a1bf30e57470105e95739aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-27T11:13:11.709Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Speaking of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/nov/27/chinese-stocks-fall-bitcoin-record-uk-industrial-strategy?page=with:block-5a1beaaed37b1906ae58ac46#block-5a1beaaed37b1906ae58ac46\">those stress tests</a>, here\u2019s a video explaining how Britain\u2019s banks have been put under the microscope.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/935103552153939968\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We will release the results of our stress test of the largest UK banks tomorrow.

      "bodyText": "The latest release of the OECD\u2019s Better Life Index shows that Australia remains a very wealthy nation with generally good health but that we continue to have a poor work-life balance, despite that being the area we rank most highly. Perhaps worst of all, however, Australian women, more than just about any other nation in the OECD, feel unsafe walking home alone at night. The common refrain about GDP is that it measures everything except what is important. Even GDP per capita is a pretty poor measure of people\u2019s livelihoods \u2013 given it says nothing about income or gender inequality, let alone aspects such as health and safety, the environment or education. The OECD has, since 2011, attempted to provide a more expansive measure of wellbeing with its Better Life Index. The index looks at data across a range of categories, from income and employment to job strain, personal safety, life satisfaction, housing and civic engagement. The latest annual report has just been issued and it finds that on average Australia comes in third among OECD nations, just behind Norway and Denmark and just ahead of Sweden and Canada. However, Australia comes in third only when equal weight is given to all categories \u2013 including, for instance, civic engagement. We have a high score for civic engagement because the measure used for this is voter turnout. Given we have compulsory voting, our civic engagement is thus perhaps artificially high. However, as the 79.5% turnout for the recent marriage equality poll showed, even when voting is not compulsory our turnout remains well above the OECD average: While Australia looks a great place to live (when all categories are given equal weight) we ourselves would not rank Australia so highly \u2013 because people do not weight matters such as civic engagement as highly as they do health or life satisfaction. Since the OECD has been running its Better Life Index it has allowed people to rank the categories in order of preference. And while the rankings are not a perfect representation of the nation \u2013 given as they only include those who share their rankings on the OECD site \u2013 they do give us some indication of where people\u2019s preferences lie. Perhaps not surprisingly people across all OECD nations rank civic engagement as the least important category. Only 6.8% of Australians regarded the category as the most important \u2013 well below the 11.9% who chose work-life balance. Interestingly, the three categories Australians chose as most important are different from those chosen by people from the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and Germany: Were we to order the Better Life Index according to the preferences given by Australians, our rank among OECD nations would likely drop, from third to eighth. This is because rating work-life balance as the most important, and civic engagement as the least important, means Australia performs above-average in the category it doesn\u2019t consider important, and below-average in the category it does. Across the OECD, Australia has the fifth highest percentage of people working more than 50 hours a week, and among those nations with available data, the second lowest for average time each day devoted to leisure and personal care: If we ranked the categories according to Australian preferences, Norway would keep the top spot, followed by Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Canada and Finland. It would appear that Australians (or at least those who have used the OECD index) like the idea of the Scandinavian lifestyle. It is a good reminder that income does not always lead to higher life satisfaction. Australia has a higher level of average disposable income, average net wealth and average earnings than all of the nine nations that record a higher level of life satisfaction, except for Norway and Switzerland: The data also suggest that while inequality may have been rising in Australia, it remains around the average of the OECD, and well below the levels of the US: We are also a nation that loves our big houses. Excluding the bathroom, toilet, kitchenette, scullery/utility rooms and garages, Australian have on average 2.3 rooms per person \u2013 the fourth highest among the OECD \u2013 behind only Canada, the US and New Zealand, reflecting perhaps the ability of those nations to have much larger houses due to area size and lower population density than Japan, Korea and the European nations. Despite this, our housing costs \u2013 in terms of ongoing expenses rather than actual cost of the house \u2013 remains low among the OECD: One ongoing issue for Australians, somewhat surprisingly, remains personal safety. Despite very good results on life expectancy, personal health and the homicide rate, only 63.6% of Australians feel safe when walking home at night. This score is well below the OECD average and well behind nations such as the US (74.1%), the UK (77.4%) and Canada (80.9%): One reason it might be somewhat surprising to me is that, as a man, it is much less of an issue for me personally. The OECD Better Life Index also breaks down the data according to gender. Overall, Australia does quite well on gender inequality (relatively speaking). While Australian women earn on average only 87% what men do per hour, that is above the OECD average. While there is a smaller percentage of women than men aged 25-64 who have upper secondary or higher education, the report notes that Australian \u201cmen and women are almost equal in terms of time off, and Australian women are less likely than men to work very long hours\u201d. But where Australia really falls down on gender disparity is in feeling safe. While Australian men feel above-average safety, only women in Chile, Mexico and Hungary feel less safe walking home alone at night. For every 10 Australian men who say they feel safe walking home at night there are only 6.3 women who would say the same \u2013 the worst gender differential in the OECD: The Better Life Index remains a good attempt to quantify those things in life that matter besides how much production is occurring in the economy. And while, as with any such measures, there will be argument over the choice of data used to measure each category, what the index does highlight is that how you rank the quality of your life depends not only on what you consider important but also on who you are.",

Even GDP per capita is a pretty poor measure of people\u2019s livelihoods \u2013 given it says nothing about income or gender inequality, let alone aspects such as health and safety, the environment or education. </p> <p> The OECD has, since 2011, attempted to provide a more expansive measure of wellbeing with its Better Life Index.</p> <p> The index looks at data across a range of categories, from income and employment to job strain, personal safety, life satisfaction, housing and civic engagement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/oct/24/women-do-most-of-the-housework-and-other-surprising-census-figures\">Women do most of the housework and other surprising census figures | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/social/how-s-life-23089679.htm\">latest annual report</a> has just been issued and it finds that on average Australia <a href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/55555555555\">comes in third among OECD nations</a>, just behind Norway and Denmark and just ahead of Sweden and Canada. </p> <p>However, Australia comes in third only when equal weight is given to all categories \u2013 including, for instance, civic engagement.</p> <p>We have a high score for civic engagement because the measure used for this is voter turnout. Given we have compulsory voting, our civic engagement is thus perhaps artificially high. However, as the 79.5% turnout for the recent marriage equality poll showed, even when voting is not compulsory our turnout remains well above the OECD average:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Chart 1\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yzxL1/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> While Australia looks a great place to live (when all categories are given equal weight) we ourselves would not rank Australia so highly \u2013 because people do not weight matters such as civic engagement as highly as they do health or life satisfaction.</p> <p> Since the OECD has been running its Better Life Index it has allowed people to rank the categories in order of preference. And while the rankings are not a perfect representation of the nation \u2013 given as they only include those who share their rankings on the OECD site \u2013 they do give us some indication of where people\u2019s preferences lie.</p> <p> Perhaps not surprisingly people across all OECD nations rank civic engagement as the least important category. Only 6.8% of Australians regarded the category as the most important \u2013 well below the 11.9% who chose work-life balance.</p> <p> Interestingly, the three categories Australians chose as most important are different from those chosen by people from the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and Germany:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Chart 2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dVnc8/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> Were we to order the Better Life Index according to the preferences given by Australians, our rank among OECD nations would likely drop, from third to eighth. </p> <p> This is because rating work-life balance as the most important, and civic engagement as the least important, means Australia performs above-average in the category it doesn\u2019t consider important, and below-average in the category it does.</p> <p> Across the OECD, Australia has the fifth highest percentage of people working more than 50 hours a week, and among those nations with available data, the second lowest for average time each day devoted to leisure and personal care:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chart 3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/72jnj/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> If we ranked the categories according to Australian preferences, Norway would keep the top spot, followed by Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Canada and Finland. It would appear that Australians (or at least those who have used the OECD index) like the idea of the Scandinavian lifestyle.</p> <p> It is a good reminder that income does not always lead to higher life satisfaction. </p> <p> Australia has a higher level of average disposable income, average net wealth and average earnings than all of the nine nations that record a higher level of life satisfaction, except for Norway and Switzerland:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chart 4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dqsnv/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The data also suggest that while inequality may have been rising in Australia, it remains around the average of the OECD, and well below the levels of the US:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chart 5\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WMBQP/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> We are also a nation that loves our big houses.</p> <p> Excluding the bathroom, toilet, kitchenette, scullery/utility rooms and garages, Australian have on average 2.3 rooms per person \u2013 the fourth highest among the OECD \u2013 behind only Canada, the US and New Zealand, reflecting perhaps the ability of those nations to have much larger houses due to area size and lower population density than Japan, Korea and the European nations.</p> <p> Despite this, our housing costs \u2013 in terms of ongoing expenses rather than actual cost of the house \u2013 remains low among the OECD:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chart 6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eDOCo/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> One ongoing issue for Australians, somewhat surprisingly, remains personal safety. </p> <p> Despite very good results on life expectancy, personal health and the homicide rate, only 63.6% of Australians feel safe when walking home at night.</p> <p> This score is well below the OECD average and well behind nations such as the US (74.1%), the UK (77.4%) and Canada (80.9%):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chart 7\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0R12h/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> One reason it might be somewhat surprising to me is that, as a man, it is much less of an issue for me personally. </p> <p> The OECD Better Life Index also breaks down the data according to gender.</p> <p> Overall, Australia does quite well on gender inequality (relatively speaking).</p> <p> While Australian women earn on average only 87% what men do per hour, that is above the OECD average. While there is a smaller percentage of women than men aged 25-64 who have upper secondary or higher education, the report notes that Australian \u201cmen and women are almost equal in terms of time off, and Australian women are less likely than men to work very long hours\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chart 8\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kTv0s/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But where Australia really falls down on gender disparity is in feeling safe. While Australian men feel above-average safety, only women in Chile, Mexico and Hungary feel less safe walking home alone at night.</p> <p> For every 10 Australian men who say they feel safe walking home at night there are only 6.3 women who would say the same \u2013 the worst gender differential in the OECD:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chart 9\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Tdm84/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The Better Life Index remains a good attempt to quantify those things in life that matter besides how much production is occurring in the economy. And while, as with any such measures, there will be argument over the choice of data used to measure each category, what the index does highlight is that how you rank the quality of your life depends not only on what you consider important but also on who you are. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s mining industry has stepped back from its hard line on trying to limit the charity sector\u2019s lobbying on energy and climate change issues. The Minerals Council of Australia says it does not support policies requiring environmental charities to devote most of their resources to on-the-ground remediation, despite previously writing submissions to government calling for it to consider such policies. Although the new stance seems to contradict earlier statements, the MCA insists there has been no change in its position. The move comes amid fractures between the MCA\u2019s membership over the tough approach, with BHP recently publicly distancing itself from the MCA\u2019s position on activity requirements for environmental charities. \u201cThey\u2019ve over-reached in bashing-up on civil society, coal and climate and energy issues,\u201d said Rod Campbell from the Australia Institute, who pressured the MCA to clarify its position. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone rogue and they\u2019re being pulled back \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Most recently, in August this year the MCA published its submission to federal Treasury\u2019s inquiry into reform of tax-deductible gift recipients. In the submission, it said Treasury\u2019s proposal to allow environmental charities to only spend 50% of their expenditure on political advocacy was \u201csound in principle\u201d, but urged Treasury to consider limiting it further to just 10%, writing: The federal government should consider adopting Canada\u2019s political activity rule for charities, to close the loophole of uncapped tax-deductible political donations through deductible gift recipients. Under Canadian law, charities can spend no more than 10 per cent of their resources (including staff and volunteer time) on political advocacy. Moreover, that advocacy must be nonpartisan and secondary to their charitable purpose. The push, which had continued for years, was taken up enthusiastically by the Coalition, with a Senate inquiry in 2015 recommending environmental groups devote at least 25% of their expenditure to \u201cenvironmental remediation work\u201d. (A Minerals Council of Australia submission to that inquiry also suggested that parliament consider lifting that to 90%.) Similarly, in a report by Liberal members of the joint standing committee on electoral matters, the Liberal members referred directly to the MCA\u2019s position and concluded \u201cthat registered environmental organisations are endorsed by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) to receive tax-deductible gifts and contributions, but only for the principal purpose of protecting the natural environment, or undertaking related education or research.\u201d Other sections of the mining lobby have been even stronger in calling for a strict limit to the advocacy activities of environmental charities. This year, the NSW Minerals Council wrote: It not only seems completely reasonable, but self-evident that a group seeking DGR status as an environmental charity is one where at least 50% of their annual expenditure goes to \u2018on-ground\u2019 activities, designed to enhance or rehabilitate the natural environment. But amid pressure from its shareholders, the MCA\u2019s biggest member, BHP, agreed to reconsider its membership of the lobby group over concerns about the hardline approach the MCA had taken with charities, and on energy policy in Australia. And then, earlier this month, the Guardian revealed BHP had openly distanced itself from the MCA\u2019s call to restrict advocacy of environmental groups, saying it did not support any such move. Now, in a letter to Transparency International, the MCA has unequivocally said it does not support the moves it previously appeared to advocate for, writing: However, the MCA does not support the government\u2019s proposal to require environmental deductible gift recipients to commit no less than 25% and up to 50% of their annual expenditure to environmental remediation as referenced in your email. The letter came after Rod Campbell, from the Australia Institute, urged the MCA to clarify whether the activity of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is an initiative the MCA has been a part of, is political advocacy. The issue appeared to reveal an inconsistency in the MCA\u2019s position, and opened up a potential confrontation with BHP on the matter. The MCA and BHP had supported charities being involved in the EITI. But if the work they did there was considered \u201cadvocacy\u201d, then the MCA\u2019s previous position appeared to make it difficult for those groups to continue the work there. The Australia Institute, Transparency International and other members of the EITI could then have raised the issue at an upcoming meeting, potentially inflaming an already difficult relationship between the MCA and BHP on the issue. The wording the MCA used in its written submissions was usually ambiguous, never directly recommending that environmental groups should have their ability to advocate limited, but repeatedly calling for the government to consider it, and describing the idea as \u201csound\u201d. David Byers, who is acting as chief executive of the MCA, said there has been no change in the MCA\u2019s position. \u201cRather, the MCA\u2019s position is that charities should comply with the Charities Act\u2019s existing provisions requiring them not to promote or oppose political parties and not to engage in unlawful activities,\u201d Byers said. Campbell says they\u2019re trying to have it both ways. \u201cBasically, they\u2019re trying to walk both sides of the street. Saying the government \u201cshould consider adopting\u201d a limit, but the MCA \u201cdoes not support\u201d adopting such a limit on advocacy,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThis enables the MCA to help the hard core of the LNP such as Barnaby Joyce to attack deductible gift-recipient environment groups, but then say they support no such thing to their image-conscious members like BHP and Rio.\u201d The MCA has also been campaigning for all charities who receive foreign donations not to be allowed to take part in political advocacy during election campaigns. The Coalition has said it will introduce legislation before the end of the year that will do that. Yesterday 25 charities launched a campaign to fight any such changes.",

Greg Clark, the business secretary, will announce the creation of an independent watchdog to monitor progress made in boosting innovation, upgrading infrastructure, increasing the level of workplace skills, ensuring that the strength of the City is reflected in funds for companies and spreading prosperity to all parts of the country. A white paper to be published by Clark will also reveal that the government intends to set up long-term strategic deals in four sectors seen as having growth potential: construction, life sciences, automotive, and artificial intelligence. New investment in the UK by the US-owned life sciences company Merck, known as MSD in Europe, creating 950 jobs, shows the benefits of the sort of partnership between Whitehall, the private sector and universities the government wants to create in its four sector deals, he will say. \u201cOur life sciences sector is one of the UK\u2019s fastest developing industries, with a turnover in excess of \u00a364bn, employing 233,000 across the UK. \u201cMSD\u2019s commitment today, and the wider sector deal investment we have secured, proves the process outlined in the industrial strategy can give companies the confidence and direction they need to invest in the UK. It will ensure Britain continues to be at the forefront of innovation and represents a huge vote of confidence in our industrial strategy.\u201d The white paper\u2019s focus on five core areas follows extensive consultation since the publication of a green paper at the start of the year. Clark believes the need for an industrial strategy has been made all the more pressing by last week\u2019s budget, in which the Office for Budget Responsibility halved its forecast of the UK\u2019s long-term productivity trend to 1%. The white paper will note that the need for the UK to seize available opportunities has been made more important by the Brexit vote. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, announced plans in the budget to raise UK spending on research and development from 1.7% to 2.4% of national income by 2027, a fillip to Clark\u2019s goal of fostering new ideas and turning them into commercial products. The government thinks extra spending on R&amp;D could mean bout \u00a380bn of additional investment in advanced technology in the next decade. But Clark also wants the white paper to concentrate on some of the other factors he believes explain the gulf between UK productivity and that of countries such as Germany. In particular, he wants the white paper to focus on Britain\u2019s poor skills record, its under-investment in infrastructure and on narrowing the productivity gap not just between the south-east and the rest of the UK but also within regions themselves. Clark has also been receptive to the idea proposed by the CBI that there should be an independent industrial strategy commission \u2013 based on the OBR model \u2013 to provide an objective assessment of progress towards the white paper\u2019s goals. The paper will identify four grand challenges, global trends that the government sees as shaping the future: artificial intelligence; clean growth; an ageing society; and future mobility from driverless cars to drones. Industrial strategy went out of fashion in the Conservative party after the defeat of the 1974-9 Labour government by Margaret Thatcher. But Clark believes a new approach based on competition rather than on picking winners will help address Britain\u2019s long-term problems. The business secretary believes the government has a role to play in putting UK companies at the vanguard of the new wave of technologies such as robotics and genomics, but he also thinks the white paper can help improve productivity in more traditional sectors, such as food and drink. \u201cWe are at one of the most important, exciting and challenging times there has ever been in the history of the world\u2019s commerce and industry,\u201d Clark will say. \u201cWe are renowned for innovation and discovery, with some of the best universities and research institutions in the world producing some of the most inventive people on earth. \u201cWe have commercial and industrial sectors \u2013 from advanced manufacturing to financial services; from life sciences to the creative industries \u2013 which are competitive with the best in the world. \u201cBut any serious strategy should address the weaknesses that stop us achieving our potential, as well as our strengths, and this industrial strategy does that. Britain\u2019s productivity performance has not been good enough, and is holding back our earning power as a country. \u201cSo this industrial strategy deliberately strengthens the five foundations of productivity: ideas, people, infrastructure, business environment and places.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Almost 100,000 households in England are being priced out of the property market each year because of a shortage of affordable homes to rent or buy, according to a report. Research by the estate agent Savills, shared with the Guardian, found the number of priced-out households had risen from its previous projection in 2015 of 70,000 a year. This was in part because of a change in how housing need is assessed, but also due to rising prices and stagnant wage growth. On Wednesday, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, reiterated a pledge to build 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s and unveiled a package of measures to support housebuilding. Savills said one-third of those would need to be offered at below market prices to meet the growing need for affordable homes. About 96,000 households are unable to afford homes at the market rate, either to buy or rent, Savills said, with the vast majority in London and the south. It said varying approaches were needed to address the shortfall in different parts of the country: low-cost rented homes were needed more in markets in which incomes were smaller, while a mixture of homes, including shared ownership, would help in more expensive areas. In London, 20% of the households affected have incomes above \u00a335,000, Savills said, while the same proportion earn less than \u00a310,000. Over the past three years, 55,000 fewer affordable homes have been built each year than were needed, the research found. Although 42,500 households in the capital required below market rate housing, only 8,800 affordable homes a year had been delivered. In the south outside London, 15,500 affordable homes a year were being built while 34,100 were needed. Meanwhile, in the north of England, low incomes were locking out 9,600 households a year, with 8,900 homes being delivered. Although the post-budget headlines were dominated by Hammond\u2019s decision to scrap stamp duty for the majority of first-time buyers, his announcement included more money for building and rule changes to help councils provide housing. A speech by the prime minister, Theresa May, at the Conservative party conference in October made a commitment of \u00a32bn over four years to fund social housing. However, to house 100,000 emerging households over this period would need funding of \u00a37bn a year, Savills said. Paying for the new homes would reduce the housing benefit bill by \u00a3430m a year. Helen Collins, the head of housing consultancy at Savills, said the budget had offered many positives for the housing sector, but expressed some concerns. \u201cWhile the chancellor had plenty of good news, we feel there are still some important issues missing from housing policy,\u201d she said. These included no changes on building on greenbelt land and no additional funding for homes for social rent. \u201cThere was little reference to the importance of social rented homes as a better and cheaper alternative to the private rented sector for very low-income households,\u201d Collins said.",
