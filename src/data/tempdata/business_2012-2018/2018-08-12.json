      "bodyText": "The DIY chain Homebase is expected to reveal the closure of up to 80 stores this week as job losses from Britain\u2019s high streets total more than 30,000. Homebase is battling for survival amid a slowdown in the housing market as well as rising costs and increasing pressure from online rivals and discounters such as B&amp;M. It wants to exit loss-making stores and agree to rent cuts ahead of a rent bill due in late September. The closures will add to the mountain of job losses on Britain\u2019s high streets. About 25,000 jobs have gone in the first seven months of 2018, according to analysis by the New Economics Foundation (NEF), with a further 8,300 jobs under threat at suppliers. The figures, which include those at risk of imminent redundancy as well as workers who have already lost their jobs, adds up to \u00a31.5bn in lost GDP, said NEF\u2019s report. At the weekend, seven Marks &amp; Spencer clothing stores closed their doors for the last time as the high-street chain pushes ahead with a transformation plan. M&amp;S said in May it plans to close 100 stores by 2022. Toys R Us, Poundworld and Maplin have collapsed, while New Look, Mothercare, Marks &amp; Spencer and Carpetright have disclosed plans to close hundreds of stores as weak consumer confidence is compounded by the online shopping boom. Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the NEF, said: \u201cThe shape of our economy is beginning to flex and buckle in response to powerful structural forces such as weakening household spending power and a shift in consumer behaviour towards online purchasing.\u201d Meanwhile, House of Fraser employees and pensioners are nervously awaiting more details about their future.

      "bodyText": "Some passengers arriving at Heathrow airport from outside the EU last month faced queues of more than two-and-a-half hours, figures have revealed. There was only one day in July when the UK Border Force achieved its target of processing 95% of passengers from Britain and outside the European Economic Area (EEA) within 45 minutes, according to data obtained by Virgin Atlantic. The longest queues at the Britain\u2019s busiest airport took place on 6 July, when non-EEA visitors spent up to two hours and 36 minutes waiting in immigration queues. Virgin Atlantic has called on the UK Border Force to take action to shorten waiting times, calling the queues \u201cunacceptable\u201d. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Craig Kreeger, told the Press Association: \u201cThis summer significant queues at Border Control mean that thousands of visitors have regularly faced the longest queues in London to get their passports checked, often over two hours, leaving them frustrated before they\u2019ve even started their trip. \u201cAt a time when the UK needs to show the world it is open for business, the government and Border Force need to provide a great first impression for every visitor every time.\u201d Heathrow\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, has called for the Home Office to allow visitors from \u201clow-risk countries such as the US\u201d to use the same electronic gates that European Union citizens can access. The Home Office said last month\u2019s queues were partially caused by a computer failure and a large number of vulnerable adults and children arriving. British Airways\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, warned last week that Heathrow\u2019s queues were \u201csignificantly worse\u201d than elsewhere in Europe. Writing in the Times, Cruz said: \u201cTwo-hour queues are fast becoming the norm.\u201d A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cThe vast majority of people who arrive at Heathrow get through the border within our service standards. But we understand the frustration for those who have experienced longer waits and remain fully committed to working with our partners to reduce waiting times as far as is possible. \u201cAt the same time, we will not compromise the essential checks we carry out at the border which keep our country safe. We are making sure Border Force has the resources it needs and are deploying 200 additional staff at Heathrow over the summer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Spending in the shops fell in July according to Visa, in another blow for Britain\u2019s struggling high streets. The credit card company, which accounts for \u00a31 in every \u00a33 spent in the UK, said that despite hopes that the heatwave could lift retailers, spending was down 0.9% in July compared with the same month a year ago. The steepest fall was in \u201cface to face\u201d spending in retail outlets, which fell by 1.2%, but even spending online dropped 0.5%. The figures are likely to reignite concern about the financial health of British households, where wage growth is running at only a fraction above inflation. Last month, ONS data revealed debt levels were worse than at any time on record, with households spending about \u00a3900 more than they received in income during 2017. The gap between inflation and earnings could narrow completely when inflation figures are published on Wednesday. These are expected to show consumer price inflation ticking up from 2.4% to 2.5%, matching the current 2.5% growth in wages and effectively meaning real incomes are flatlining. Visa said that while warmer weather boosted spending on food, drink, restaurants and hotels, it was more than offset by a marked fall in spending on transport and household goods. Mark Antipof, the chief commercial officer at Visa, said: \u201cRetailers had a difficult time in early 2018, and while there was some respite in May and June, July\u2019s fall in spending is concerning, particularly as we look ahead when the impact of the interest rate rise and back-to-school costs will likely put further pressure on Britons\u2019 wallets.\u201d The figures may suggest that the relatively robust GDP growth of 0.4% in the second quarter of 2018 could be short-lived. Visa said its spending index correctly pointed to the slowdown in UK economic growth in the first part of 2018, when GDP growth slipped back to 0.2%. \u201cThe July figures pointed to a disappointing start to the third quarter,\u201d the company said. \u201cOn an annual basis, total expenditure fell 0.9% in July, thereby ending a two-month sequence of expansion.\u201d Separate figures from LSL Property Services and Acadata reveal that house prices recorded their fifth successive month of declines in July. It said average prices fell 0.2% during the month to \u00a3302,251, taking the annual rate of house price growth to 1.6%. Prices fell across all parts of London and the south, as well as the east of England. It added that transactions were 6% below the seasonal trend. The figures are in contrast to Halifax, which recorded a surprise rise in prices in July. LSL said its index included cash purchases of property as well as the mortgage data recorded by the major lenders. A survey released by Nottingham Building Society found that the recent raft of bank branch closures is hastening the loss of local shops on the high street. It found that 46% of shop owners blame the loss of a local bank branch in the last three years for negatively impacting their business, while 24% said it contributed to them going out of business within the last five years. Small business owners are suffering as a result of lower footfall, with 36% of consumers saying they would make fewer visits to their town or village once their local bank branch closed. About 40% said they would make at least three fewer visits a month as a result. Shop owners in areas affected by branch closures estimate that their annual revenue dropped by an average of 20% after the bank shut its doors.",

I hope this is a viable strategy, because our beleaguered high street deserves better. The buzz of the high street is second to none if there are a diversity of shops offering a vibrant experience and not a soulless one. This unfair playing field needs levelling before any more classic names hit the buffers of tough trading conditions and big tax bills, while the internet giants cock a legal but immoral snook at the exchequer.

      "bodyText": "German and French vintners are harvesting their grapes weeks ahead of schedule following the heatwave that has affected much of Europe. While many German farmers have complained that the hot and dry climate has damaged their crops, with yields of some, such as wheat, expected to be down by as much as 50%, vintners have seen reason to celebrate. \u201cWe are extremely early with our harvest this year,\u201d Ernst B\u00fcscher, from the German Wine Institute, told German media. \u201cHistorically speaking we\u2019re around three weeks ahead of where we\u2019d usually be.\u201d Yields are also predicted to be considerably higher than usual. The long, hot, period is expected to produce a better quality wine due to riper grapes with a higher sugar content and consequently a higher alcohol content as well, according to experts, who were poised to taste the much anticipated very young wine, or federweisser, when it was due to go on sale this weekend. The early harvest puts German vintners on a good footing with their Italian colleagues. Usually imports of Italy\u2019s young wines hit the German market about a month ahead of German ones. This year they will be in direct competition as they come on the market at a similar time. But vintners also struck a note of caution, saying some grapes would be affected by excessive heat, which could cause the acid in the fruit to break down, giving the wine a stale taste. In France, where grape harvests in some areas are also due to begin earlier than usual, winemakers in the southern Languedoc region said production levels were likely to be higher than last year. The French agriculture minister, St\u00e9phane Travert, said the 2018 grape output was expected to be higher than average following weather-related losses in production last year, including a late cold snap that slashed the local harvest in Bordeaux by 40%. French wine critics expect this year to be a good vintage. S\u00e9bastien Vaillant, a wine maker in Valen\u00e7ay in the Loire Valley, told France Bleu radio he expected \u201ca very good vintage, with silkier and softer tannins\u201d. Because of the high levels of rain this spring, wine-growing regions in France had not had a drought. But hailstorms that hit vineyards in May had left a threat of mould, particularly for the organic winegrowers who do not use pesticides. The recent heat helped fight off the mould. Only farmers of asparagus and strawberries have been as upbeat as German vintners over the heatwave. Elsewhere in Germany, farming representatives have called for the government to compensate them to the tune of \u20ac1bn (\u00a3890m) for the loss of revenues they expect due to the drought. German beer producers have experienced a surge in business due to the hot weather, with people flocking to beer gardens and pubs. The World Cup also did much to boost sales, to the extent that brewers had to issue an appeal last week for consumers to return their bottles due to a shortage. But brewers are gloomier about the longer term, due to this year\u2019s failure of barley crops, which have suffered in the prolonged heat. Beer producers in northern Germany are predicting that yields of the crop \u2013 which is needed for malt \u2013 could drop by as much as 40%. Brewers are warning that at the very least costs will rise, which will have to be passed on to drinkers. The shortages are also being experienced elsewhere in northern Europe, particularly Scandinavia, in part due to its heatwave-related wildfires, and the Baltic states.",

Worried that the government was not making enough preparations for the possibility of no deal being reached in the \u201cnegotiations\u201d with the other 27 members of the EU, the voluble Brexiters within and without the cabinet called for evidence. They have got it, in spades. The so-called impact assessments for no deal are, quite simply, horrifying. They were underlined recently by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who rightly drew attention to the messages coming through loud and clear from business, trade unions, the City and, not least, food suppliers, road hauliers, ports and airports. Now, of course, when they have got what they asked for \u2013 namely, attention to the possibility of a cliff-edge Brexit \u2013 the Brexiters don\u2019t like it and yell \u201cproject fear\u201d. The governor was good on this too. Having pointed out that the possibility of no deal was \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d, he reminded the Brexiters that the pound had indeed crashed after the referendum, by some 17%. British holidaymakers are lucky now if they can receive \u20ac1.10 to the pound at the better places. As for those dreadful airport money changers, I saw 94 cents to the pound being quoted the other day. Just imagine what further damage crashing out of the EU would do to the currency. Moreover, the British economy has already moved backwards, from being the fastest-growing economy among the leading EU countries to the slowest. The Bank calculates that the referendum and the prospect of Brexit have lopped up to 2% off gross domestic product. Now, it has been suggested that the man or woman in the street might well wonder what GDP losses have to do with people like them. The answer is: more than they might think. Slower growth affects the standard of living throughout the economy. And interruptions to the \u201cjust in time\u201d flow of fresh food from the continent would hit people where it hurts most. The pre-Brexit economic damage would have been even greater if the Bank of England had not pulled out the stops, kept interest rates down and boosted the liquidity of the financial system. Indeed, my suspicion is that the monetary policy committee only raised interest rates the other week to give it scope to lower them again if the worst happens. Already, in preparation for a crisis, the Bank has presided over a tripling in the amount of capital the banks have in reserve, and increased the liquidity of the system by several times this multiple. It is not as if there are not enough economic problems surfacing without the added threatened catastrophe of Brexit. The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s fiscal sustainability report for July is replete with warnings of the problems caused by a drastic drop in the growth of the nation\u2019s productive potential. It is difficult not to conclude that this has been caused by the cumulative impact on confidence and investment of the austerity programme introduced by George Osborne. The OBR states baldly that, \u201cbroadly speaking, the fiscal position is unsustainable if the public sector is on course to absorb an ever-increasing share of national income simply to pay the interest on its accumulated debt\u201d. Only the deluded Brexiters imagine that Brexit would ease the nation\u2019s financial problems. Those financial institutions planning to relocate on the continent \u2013 some are doing so already \u2013 are not exactly going to add to this nation\u2019s tax revenues. As for May\u2019s attempt to suck up to the Brexiters \u2013 it has been one sop to Cerberus after another \u2013 the OBR notes: \u201cAs regards the \u2018Brexit dividend\u2019, our provisional analysis suggests that Brexit is more likely to weaken the public finances than strengthen them over the medium term, thanks to its likely effect on the economy and tax revenues.\u201d If there is hope amid the chaos, it must surely be that the mounting evidence of the self-harm involved in Brexit will produce a change in the public mood. In a fascinating letter to the Financial Times on 1 August, Robert A Rogowsky, professor of trade and economic diplomacy at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, suggested that \u201cresponsible leadership in London should reveal the cost of Brexit and get a proper ballot in place to confirm that British voters are willing to pay for it\u201d. He gives the example of how the voters of Alaska changed their minds about moving the state capital when faced with the true costs. Remember that haunting song It Happened in Monterey? Well this idea comes from a different Monterey, but I like it.",

      "bodyText": "A decade ago, Britain was in the early stages of what would turn out to be the deepest recession of recent times. It has never really recovered. Only twice in the past 10 years has the economy broken out of its post-crisis torpor. The first time was in late 2009 and early 2010, when the country was jolted back into life by the monetary and fiscal stimulus provided by the Bank of England. That rally was killed off by George Osborne\u2019s ill-timed austerity and by the protracted troubles of the eurozone. In 2013, five years after the start of the financial crisis, there was again optimism that the economy was at last fully recovered, but this proved illusory. A period of strong growth lasted for two years, but it was a classic sugar-rush prompted by the government\u2019s decision to, in effect, crank up the housing market. Politically, policies such as funding for lending and help to buy did the trick. Demand for housing and consumer durables increased, and a feelgood factor was generated in time for the Conservatives to win the 2015 general election. Thereafter, though, the pace of activity slackened. Even before the EU referendum in the summer of 2016, the economy was losing momentum, because even with record low interest rates, property was too expensive for potential first-time buyers. The economy has performed far better since the Brexit vote than either the Treasury or the Bank of England imagined. Not only has there not been a recession, there has not even been a single quarter of negative growth. Unemployment has continued to fall and currently stands at a 42-year low. But the past two years have also starkly illustrated the deep structural problems of the British economy: too many low-paid, low-productivity jobs; an over-reliance on housing bubbles to lift growth above the mediocre; the inability of a shrunken manufacturing base to take advantage of a more competitive pound and strong global demand; a long-established tendency to under-invest. The latest official figures released by the ONS sum things up nicely. Growth of around 0.4% a quarter is the new normal. A colossal trade deficit in goods cannot quite be offset by Britain\u2019s service-sector exports. Manufacturing, after two quarters of falling output, is technically in recession. This pattern of mediocre growth will be broken in the next year. If Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal, there will be a recession as business investment dries up and a falling pound makes life a lot tougher for consumers by increasing the cost of imports. The opposite will occur in the event of a deal between the UK and the EU. Sterling will rise on the currency markets, making imports cheaper. Some of the business investment that has been mothballed during the negotiations will be given the go-ahead. There will be a spurt in growth. But the spurt will prove temporary because Britain will quickly revert to its default setting: investing and producing too little, borrowing and consuming too much. There has been much talk over the past decade about the inadequacies of the economy. Osborne arrived at the Treasury promising that there would be less reliance on consumer and public debt, and later hailed the imminent \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d. Theresa May said the country needed a new industrial strategy to ensure that prosperity fanned out from London and the south-east to the old industrial towns that voted heavily for Brexit. But it has all been empty rhetoric. Households are spending more than they are earning for the first time in 30 years. There has been no march of the makers. Nothing much has emerged from May\u2019s much-vaunted industrial strategy since it was published at the end of last year. Nothing, in other words, has really changed since the banks almost blew up the economy in the autumn of 2008. A golden opportunity has been wasted. Truly, this has been a lost decade. Trump could march Turkey to the brink Occupying an ancient crossroads between east and west, Turkey has long held a position of strategic importance for the world economy. Over the past century, differing rates of economic development have left it eclipsed by rivals, yet it still ranks as one of the most significant emerging-market nations. In this respect, a widening economic crisis and plunging currency, made worse by intervention from Donald Trump last week, could spell trouble for other developing countries. Turkey faces spiralling external debts and rampant inflation, while a spat over an imprisoned US pastor means the country faces economic sanctions, making life even more difficult for its strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Having secured sweeping new powers at elections earlier this year, Erdo\u011fan has shown he would rather make belligerent speeches calling on God (and urging Turks to sell the gold under their pillows) than tackle the problems facing the economy. The lira has plunged by almost half this year, fed by his intransigence. In power for 15 years, Erdo\u011fan has named his son-in-law finance minister and holds significant sway over the central bank. This puts Turkey in a bind as pressure comes from global investors for the country to raise interest rates to stem the fall in the lira. Higher borrowing costs would slow the economy, which would be unpalatable for Erdo\u011fan. There has been talk of capital controls or a bailout from the IMF as alternatives, but analysts also doubt the president would accept the terms that would come with support from the global lender of last resort. International investors are waking up to the risks and rapidly heading for the exits, returning to safer-haven assets such as the US dollar and German bunds. Emerging markets across the board have seen their currencies fall as a consequence. Banks in Europe could be at risk from the fallout. While hopes remain for a resolution, the risk of Turkish contagion for other emerging markets \u2013 and even the rest of the world \u2013 is rising. Why first-years shouldn\u2019t fear the student loan The killjoys will be out in force on Thursday as thousands of young people celebrate their A-level results. As they make plans for university, they\u2019ll be told they\u2019ll be lumbered with vast debts and pay silly amounts of interest. Yes, the average student debt will be big. Frighteningly big. Students starting university this year could easily owe more than \u00a360,000 at the point they graduate. Even while they\u2019re studying, interest on their debt will rack up at around 6% a year, adding up to \u00a37,000. But the reality is that few studentswill ever repay it. Calculations by Hargreaves Lansdown suggest that a graduate would have to be on a starting salary of \u00a356,000 a year if they were going to pay off their entire loan. If they were to land a job at a City bank or \u201cmagic circle\u201d law firm, they could eventually pay as much as \u00a3170,000 back in loans plus interest. Hargreaves recommends such high-flyers pay that down as soon as possible. But the rest? The Institute of Fiscal Studies reckons 83% of graduates will never repay their student loan in full, with the slate wiped clean 30 years after graduation. The founder of Moneysavingexpert, Martin Lewis, is particularly bothered by claims about horrifying debt burdening a younger generation. He says the fear is misplaced, as \u201cthose who don\u2019t gain too much financially from going to university will repay little or nothing\u201d. Graduates only repay when they\u2019re earning \u00a32,083 a month (equivalent to \u00a325,000 a year)) and then it\u2019sthe amount is fixed at 9% of everything above that. Hargreaves estimates that a graduate who finds a job on \u00a320,000 a year, then only gets minimal pay rises, will repay only \u00a319,000 of the \u00a360,000 borrowed by the time it is written off. That might comfort someone embarking on a low-wage career in the arts or charity sector. But selling university as a great option because, you know, you probably won\u2019t really earn that much afterwards is not the greatest enticement. And there will be a final reckoning: total student debt in the UK is already around \u00a3100bn, and is expected to climb to nearly half a trillion pounds by 2049. If most of it is never going to be repaid, then the chancellor will need more than an \u201cA\u201d in advanced maths to solve that problem.",

      "bodyText": "The ability of the British economy to improve the living standards of workers will come back under the microscope this week, when the latest figures for wages, employment and inflation are revealed by government statisticians. The Bank of England reckons higher wages are just around the corner, helped by the lowest rate of unemployment since the mid-1970s, yet economists are doubtful there will be much positive news just yet. While the economy has gathered pace in recent months, helped by the warmer weather, the royal wedding and the World Cup, there has been little evidence so far of the spoils being shared through pay increases. The growth rate might have doubled to 0.4% in the second quarter from the first three months of the year, but the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, has warned that this is far from enough to support workers. \u201cWe should not accept weak growth as the new normal \u2013 it\u2019s the result of bad management of the economy. There has been too little investment and a failure to focus on getting wages rising,\u201d she said. The consensus among City analysts is for annual growth in average weekly earnings in the three months to June to hold steady at 2.7%, the same level as recorded in May, when the Office for National Statistics publishes the latest figures on Tuesday. Threadneedle Street raised interest rates this month in the hope that greater pay rises are just around the corner. Ian McCafferty, an outgoing member of the monetary policy committee, said last week he thought wage rises could accelerate towards 4% next year amid rising labour market shortages. The latest figures are expected to continue showing unemployment hovering at 4.2%, which would be the joint-lowest level since Mud and the Bay City Rollers were topping the charts in May 1975. Updated inflation figures, seen as the benchmark for pay increases to beat in order for them to be meaningful, will be published on Wednesday. Having risen sharply since the Brexit vote as a result of the weak pound, inflation reached a five-year high towards the end of 2017, although it has begun fading in recent months. Economists predict the consumer price index will have risen again in July, eroding the spending power of hard-pressed British households. Fuelled by the rising cost of petrol at the pump for motorists, while global oil prices remain high, the CPI is forecast to have risen to 2.5% from a level of 2.4% in June. There will also be fresh readings for the property market, which are likely to point towards continuing weakness in London, dragging down the growth rate for house prices across the country. If Tuesday is about wages and Wednesday the cost of living, Thursday will complete the picture by showing how British consumers are spending their incomes. The latest snapshot for retail sales in July is forecast to indicate a rebound for consumer spending. The summer heatwave and the opening stages of the World Cup discouraged shoppers from buying much aside from food and drink in June, although there are hopes for a recovery as England made it to the semi-final. Month-on-month sales are expected to grow by 0.2%, having fallen by 0.5% in June. All eyes will then turn again to the Brexit negotiations as they resume on Thursday \u2013 which could have implications for the pound. Sterling has dropped to the lowest levels this year against the euro and the dollar in recent weeks, at a time when fears are mounting that Britain is at risk of crashing out of the EU without a deal.",

While the economy has gathered pace in recent months, helped by the warmer weather, the royal wedding and the World Cup, there has been little evidence so far of the spoils being shared through pay increases.</p> <p>The growth rate might have doubled to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/10/british-manufacturing-in-recession-despite-faster-uk-gdp-growth\">0.4% in the second quarter </a>from the first three months of the year, but the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, has warned that this is far from enough to support workers.</p> <p>\u201cWe should not accept weak growth as the new normal \u2013 it\u2019s the result of bad management of the economy. There has been too little investment and a failure to focus on getting wages rising,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The consensus among City analysts is for annual growth in average weekly earnings in the three months to June to hold steady at 2.7%, the same level as recorded in May, when the Office for National Statistics publishes the latest figures on Tuesday.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street raised interest rates this month in the hope that greater pay rises are just around the corner. Ian McCafferty, an outgoing member of the monetary policy committee, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/09/interest-rates-will-stay-low-for-20-years-bank-of-england-expert\">said last week</a> he thought wage rises could accelerate towards 4% next year amid rising labour market shortages.</p> <p>The latest figures are expected to continue showing unemployment hovering at 4.2%, which would be the joint-lowest level since Mud and the Bay City Rollers were topping the charts in May 1975.</p> <p>Updated inflation figures, seen as the benchmark for pay increases to beat in order for them to be meaningful, will be published on Wednesday. Having risen sharply since the Brexit vote as a result of the weak pound, inflation reached a five-year high towards the end of 2017, although it has begun fading in recent months.</p> <p>Economists predict the consumer price index will have risen again in July, eroding the spending power of hard-pressed British households. Fuelled by the rising cost of petrol at the pump for motorists, while global oil prices remain high, the CPI is forecast to have risen to 2.5% from a level of 2.4% in June.</p> <p>There will also be fresh readings for the property market, which are likely to point towards continuing weakness in London, dragging down the growth rate for house prices across the country.</p> <p>If Tuesday is about wages and Wednesday the cost of living, Thursday will complete the picture by showing how British consumers are spending their incomes. The latest snapshot for retail sales in July is forecast to indicate a rebound for consumer spending. The summer heatwave and the opening stages of the World Cup discouraged shoppers from buying much aside from food and drink in June, although there are hopes for a recovery as England made it to the semi-final. Month-on-month sales are expected to grow by 0.2%, having fallen by 0.5% in June.</p> <p>All eyes will then turn again to the Brexit negotiations as they resume on Thursday \u2013 which could have implications for the pound. Sterling has dropped to the lowest levels this year against the euro and the dollar in recent weeks, at a time when fears are mounting that Britain is at risk of crashing out of the EU without a deal.</p>",
