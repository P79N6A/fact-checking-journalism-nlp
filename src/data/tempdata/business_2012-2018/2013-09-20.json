      "bodyText": "\u2022 There's always a deal or two that marks the top of a market. The turn-of-the-century dotcom bubble burst just after Vodafone's assault on Mannesmann and the flotation of lastminute.com. Royal Bank of Scotland's absurd purchase of ABN Amro in 2007 was followed by the banking bust. And Foxtons, famously, was bought in a leveraged buyout the same year, just before house prices cracked. Here we go again then? Does Foxtons' soaraway flotation herald doom? Well, financial history rarely repeats so precisely. London's house prices, despite rising 10% in a year, are probably not about to plunge imminently because George Osborne, foolishly, is determined to apply his Help to Buy magic sauce and Mark Carney at the Bank of England is preaching that interest rates will be low for ages. The tide of cheap money can probably keep the show going for another 18 months or two years. Foxtons is currently in a sweet spot. Yet almost every feature of this \u00a3650m flotation screams \"buyer beware\". Foxtons has come to market at roughly twice the price at which it was sold in 2007. It has opened more branches in the interim, and perhaps demonstrated resilience during recession, but estate agency will forever be an up-and-down game. And, for all Foxtons' boasts about superiority in IT, the business is mostly about the hard slog of chasing commissions. Note, too, that the current owners \u2013 BC Partners and management \u2013 seem anxious to take the maximum number of chips off the table. The private equity firm has sold 75% of its holding and chief executive Michael Brown has turned half his \u00a3104m stake into cash. The shares, after the first-day pop, are valued at 20 times expected earnings for 2014. It spells property trouble ahead \u2013 eventually. \u2022 Boo, hiss, why can't these ugly New York funds that have turned up as big owners of Co-op Bank's bonds just play nicely? Why can't they take their share of pain, as Co-op's management hopes all bondholders will do? That way everybody, including the Bank of England, could stop fretting about the possibility of the recapitalisation plan being voted down, thereby creating a mess for regulators. The trouble is, Aurelius Capital Management and Silver Point Capital, leaders of a consortium calling itself LT2 Group, hold some cards. They and their co-travellers own 43% of Co-Bank's senior bonds, which is about 30% of the entire collection of bonds. In a restructuring that requires super-majority approval of all classes of bondholders, LT2 has made itself hard to ignore. This week the group played its first card. It's nonsense, it says, for the Co-op Bank to claim its way is the only way to plug the \u00a31.5bn capital hole. A plan B could be an old-fashioned debt-for-equity swap. This would leave the bondholders as the new owners and the Co-op Group could leave the scene of its banking catastrophe and concentrate on funerals and supermarkets. Well, it's radical \u2013 but also vague. The thousands of small investors congregated in the junior bonds will rightly ask what's in it for them. As Mark Taber's retail bondholder group says: \"It's hard to argue that non-dividend paying equity could be appropriate for pensioners who rely on the coupon on Co-op bonds for their income.\" Fair point. But the retail bondholders are not powerless since their approval is also needed for any recapitalisation plan. So LT2, in theory, has an incentive to throw its weight around on behalf of all bondholders and perhaps slip the pensioners more of what they want. These wheels within wheels are making life tricky for the Co-op Bank's management. On day one, their idea looked elegant. The Co-op Group, in a roundabout way, would inject \u00a31bn into the bank and the bondholders would take a \u00a3500m haircut, thereby honouring the new regulatory principle that bank creditors should be bailed in. The Co-op Bank would emerge as a listed entity but with Co-op Group as the largest shareholder. But, as the weeks pass without a prospectus, good questions are being asked. LT2 wonders why bondholders weren't invited to negotiate at the outset. Taber asks if the Co-op Group should carry more of the bill for useless IT. And everybody wants to know if the Co-op Group has been pushed hard enough by regulators to stand behind its bank. It's complex. The management's broad plan still seems the most credible since the Co-op Bank would be half-naked without the Co-op's involvement. But the Co-op has not helped itself by adopting a take-it-or-leave-it stance on its proposals. It should talk to the rebels seriously. Friday's move to establish an independent committee to consider alternative plans could be a step in the right direction. \u2022 Never count your chickens and all that, but this column's \u00a320 flutter on Ocado is going well. The bet, if you recall, was that the online grocer's shares would outperform Tesco's this year. Publicity-hungry bookie Paddy Power, bizarrely sceptical about Sir Stuart Rose's arrival as chairman in January, offered odds of 7-2. In a two-horse contest, that looked generous. So it is proving. Ocado has quadrupled in value since the off; Tesco is up 9%. So, barring a tectonic shift in market sentiment, the Guardian's Christmas charity is in line for \u00a370. Yes, that's correct, Ocado has quadrupled \u2013 to a value of \u00a32.5bn. For betting purposes, we'll count our blessings. But has the former overdose of gloom about Ocado been replaced by excess optimism? The Morrisons deal has improved prospects; and the second distribution centre is running smoothly; and, yes, there's potential to sell the slick IT technology overseas. But we're still talking about a business rated at 60 times its projected earnings in 2015, according to enthusiastic broker Numis's forecast. Asos \u2013 a parallel stirring online tale from the world of fast fashion \u2013 enjoys a similar rating, thus its \u00a34.5bn stock market value. So try a little experiment. A hypothetical Asos/Ocado combo is now worth \u00a37bn. That's not far off the \u00a38.3bn valuation of Marks &amp; Spencer, Rose's old shop and a business that should make pre-tax profits of about \u00a3700m this year. On a 10-year view, which would you rather own? M&amp;S, one has to assume, should be able to do better than go sideways for a decade. For Asos and Ocado, projected cash-based operating profits (ie, ignoring depreciation etc) are roughly \u00a395m apiece for 2015 (so still two years away), according to City analysts. Could the dynamic duo close the profit gap on M&amp;S over the rest of a decade, which is a long investment horizon? It's hard to believe so. Asos and Ocado are obviously winners in the retailing revolution, but a tenner on M&amp;S please. \u2022 \"We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off,\" declared Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's boss, on Friday. Yes, gouging punters whose luggage is slightly overweight, or slightly too big, definitely counts as irritating. It would cost Ryanair little to show some courtesy. The problem for O'Leary is that he has spent 20 years promoting Ryanair as the brash upstart that has succeeded by being aggressive towards customers and competitors. Achieving a softer image may take a decade. O'Leary's problem, though, is that Ryanair's first profit warning in years can't be blamed wholly on its \"macho or abrupt culture\". Competitors have sharpened their prices and fly closer to cities customers want to reach. That may be the real cause of the profits disappointment \u2013 so a tweak to the luggage policy and the intimidating website won't make much difference.",

      "bodyText": "You know how it is. You've got \u00a330m-\u00a350m to spend on a home and you can't find a thing that's suitable. That's the bizarre situation the world's super wealthy now find themselves in, as a result of the boom in London's super-prime property market. According to the small but influential group of agents that discreetly buy and sell the capital's priciest properties, desirable homes in the \u00a350m to \u00a3200m category are proving as elusive as a Bugatti sports car. And if you want one where a developer hasn't already marbled the bathroom \u2013 one where you can choose where to put the pool or nanny's quarters, or the latest security measures \u2013 they are, it seems, proving almost impossible to find in a market that's already risen by 5% this year. Eric Schmidt, the billionaire chairman of Google, is just one of many trying \u2013 and so far failing \u2013 to find a suitable home despite his willingness to part with over \u00a330m. The internet entrepreneur has appointed a friend of Prince William to find him a family-sized home in the upmarket London neighbourhoods of Chelsea or Holland Park. He is yet to find somewhere despite being described as not a particularly \"fussy buyer\". The Guardian is aware of at least one famous footballer who is struggling to find a suitable home in central London with a similar sum to Schmidt at his disposal. David Adams, whose agency John Taylor specialises in marketing luxury homes with an average asking price of \u00a315.5m, said it was getting harder to find homes at the very top of the market that met his clients' exacting needs. Meanwhile, Noel De Keyzer, who heads the Sloane Street branch of Savills, which sells homes for up to \u00a3100m in Belgravia, said the number of properties on his books was half the level of five years ago. While Rightmove lists properties going for many millions \u2013 including one \"unmodernised\" pad that can be yours for \u00a365m, Adams said most super-prime properties would never appear in an estate agent's window. \"Buyers and sellers at the very top of the market are increasingly choosing to do their business away from the public gaze. Around 65% of our business is now conducted off-market.\" One issue is security \u2013 which is high on any super-prime buyer's shopping list. They want bulletproof garage doors and iris-recognition door key technology \u2013 and they don't want the interior, exterior or floorplans of their home in the public domain. \"Buyers don't want homes that have appeared all over the internet for security reasons,\" says Adams. Another is tax. \"If the government were ever stupid enough to introduce a mansion tax, it would be hard for a buyer's lawyer to deny a valuation, if that sum had appeared on the web.\" He said vendors who don't want the world to know they are selling up ask him, and a handful of other top agents, to quietly offer their multimillion pound homes to those who have the money Another high-end property agent, Henry Pryor, described how names of the top agents were usually passed between friends and acquaintances at dinner parties. \"It's how the market is right now,\" he said. According to investment firm London Central Portfolio, there have only been nine properties sold for more than \u00a320m in London so far this year, although these figures exclude those bought in the name of a company, a technique used by many overseas buyers. Agents report houses in the \u00a31m-\u00a32m price bracket selling fast, but fear the \u00a36m-\u00a315m market is flooded with sellers who are rushing to cash in on recent prices. De Keyzer said at the very top end, properties were simply not changing hands. \"A lot of the international buyers who bought a few years ago have seen the values of those properties rise \u2013 in Knightsbridge, for example prices have gone up by 130% over the last five years. The owners are not in debt, so they don't need to sell,\" he said. Earlier this week the Office of National Statistics said property prices in London had risen by almost 10% in the year to July. Land Registry figures have reported that sold prices in Kensington &amp; Chelsea now average more than \u00a31.1m \u2013 indeed the space taken up by a doormat in the royal borough is now worth more than \u00a33,500.",

Both have now combined, somewhat unexpectedly, to break the momentum carrying the United States, and possibly other western powers, toward a disastrous military intervention in Syria.</p> <p>Russia's domestic situation remains deplorable. With the collapse of the planned economy in 1991, Russia proved to be not so much a developed as a misdeveloped country, unable to sell most of its products in non-captive markets.</p> <p>So Russia regressed into a commodity-based economy, mainly selling energy, while its talented scientists and technicians sought jobs abroad and its intellectual life decayed. Russia is also, no surprise, blighted by corruption, which drives away foreign investment and costs the country billions of dollars annually.</p> <p>This underlying debility has been masked by high energy prices, which, over the 14 years of President Vladimir Putin's rule, have allowed Russia to combine the features of a kleptocracy with <em>per capita</em> income growth sufficient to quell dissent and create a shopping-mad middle class. The accumulation of reserves from the oil and gas industries can be used to develop much-needed infrastructure.

      "bodyText": "Russia presents two opposing faces to the world: one menacing, the other benign. Both have now combined, somewhat unexpectedly, to break the momentum carrying the United States, and possibly other western powers, toward a disastrous military intervention in Syria. Russia's domestic situation remains deplorable. With the collapse of the planned economy in 1991, Russia proved to be not so much a developed as a misdeveloped country, unable to sell most of its products in non-captive markets. So Russia regressed into a commodity-based economy, mainly selling energy, while its talented scientists and technicians sought jobs abroad and its intellectual life decayed. Russia is also, no surprise, blighted by corruption, which drives away foreign investment and costs the country billions of dollars annually. This underlying debility has been masked by high energy prices, which, over the 14 years of President Vladimir Putin's rule, have allowed Russia to combine the features of a kleptocracy with per capita income growth sufficient to quell dissent and create a shopping-mad middle class. The accumulation of reserves from the oil and gas industries can be used to develop much-needed infrastructure. But, for all the Kremlin's talk of diversification, Russia remains an economy with a Latin American, rather than a western profile. Russia's politics are equally dispiriting. If western foreign policy has a guiding principle, it is the promotion of human rights. This has not influenced the Russian government's domestic or foreign policies in the slightest.

Over in Greece, Helena Smith says the prospect of Angela Merkel taking the helm of government is not going down well. She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More than any other person the German chancellor has been identified with the punishing austerity Greeks have been subjected to since their debt-stricken country plunged into crisis. More often than not, Greek media run unflattering pictures of the German chancellor including portraying her in Nazi garb \u2013 moustache and all.</p> <p>Now, nearly half of Greeks (47%) have made their disdain for the leader official telling an opinion poll canvassed by Public Issue that the consequences of her re-election would be \u201csomewhat negative\u201d for Greece. By comparison 10% said they thought it would be positive for the country\u2019s interests. An overwhelming 79% said they had a negative opinion of the chancellor while 75% said they had a negative view of Germany itself.</p> <p>The survey is a stark contrast to the view currently held by prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party coalition which quite clearly is looking to Berlin for salvation as Athens heads towards opening negotiations over a third rescue package. As the main provided of bailout funds to date, it is hoped Europe\u2019s powerhouse will tone down the pressure whatever government gets in. Greek officials are assuming that Frau Merkel will pip her opponents to the finishing line - and that it will be better to deal with the devil they know.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on that note, ahead of the weekend's poll, its time to draw the blog to a close.

In national polls, they're hovering around the 5 percent support needed to keep their seats in Parliament.</p> <p>Merkel and her conservative Union bloc are pushing back, saying they have no votes to give away. If the coalition loses its majority, the likeliest outcome would be a \"grand coalition\" between Merkel's party and the center-left Social Democrats and the conservatives want to be as strong as possible.</p> <p>\"I would advise us all in the final hours before the election to fight our political opponents and not argue over each other's votes,\" Bavarian governor Horst Seehofer, who led Merkel's conservative bloc to victory there, told the daily Die Welt.</p> <p>The Free Democrats have \"potential of well over 5 percent,\" he was quoted as saying. They won nearly 15% at the last election.</p> <p>\"I think it's a very strange understanding of democracy when the impression is raised that citizens' votes belong to the chancellor,\" the Free Democrats' general secretary, Patrick Doering, shot back on n-tv television.</p> <p>ZDF's poll of 1,369 people gave Merkel's conservatives 40 percent support and the Free Democrats 5.5%. Challenger Peer Steinbrueck's Social Democrats polled 27%, their Green allies 9% and the hard-line Left Party with which the center-left parties say they won't work 8.5%.</p> <p>The poll showed a new anti-euro party, Alternative for Germany, at 4% not enough to win parliamentary seats. It gave a margin of error of plus or minus up to three percentage points.</p> </blockquote> <p>But do note <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/20/markets-await-german-elections-india-surprises-with-interest-rate-hike-live#block-523be8e6e4b0ae8bad15bc04\">the caveat from earlier</a> - some analysts think AfD are doing better than that.....</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-523c11d4e4b0ae8bad15bc11\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-20T09:19:48.665Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Looking back at the German election... here's <a href=\"http://t.co/OtiuyxNst9\">a handy graphic</a> showing how last night's polling data would translate into seats in the Bundestag:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/electionista/statuses/380945299243421696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Germany - FGW poll in seats: CDU/CSU 266, SPD 179, Greens 60, LINKE 56, FDP 37 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23btw13&amp;src=hash\">#btw13</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/OtiuyxNst9\">pic.twitter.com/OtiuyxNst9</a></p>&mdash; electionista (@electionista) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/electionista/statuses/380945299243421696\">September 20, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The&#xa0;CDU's 266 seats,plus the&#xa0;FDP's 37, would give the current coalition a small majority --which&#xa0;could make for some tight votes on future eurozone policy.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-20T12:03:38.670Z\">at 1.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-523c0d2de4b07c4cb668e078\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-20T08:55:53.821Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On a lighter note, there's <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aca77bd2-2071-11e3-b8c6-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=intl&amp;siteedition=uk\">a correction in the Financial Times today</a> that deserves a wide audience (with many thanks to <strong>Luke Baker</strong> of <strong>Reuters</strong>)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LukeReuters/statuses/380968309711462400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Great correction in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FT\">@FT</a>: Cathay Pacific CEO wrongly quoted as saying &quot;overseas parrot&quot; instead of &quot;overseas parent&quot; <a href=\"http://t.co/WU7wO1K9MC\">http://t.co/WU7wO1K9MC</a></p>&mdash; Luke Baker (@LukeReuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LukeReuters/statuses/380968309711462400\">September 20, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LukeReuters/statuses/380970278823923713\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Quote in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FT\">@FT</a> from Cathay Pacific CEO was: &#39;He added it was important that HK carriers were not \u201ctaking directions from an overseas parrot\u201d&#39;</p>&mdash; Luke Baker (@LukeReuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LukeReuters/statuses/380970278823923713\">September 20, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-20T08:56:27.689Z\">at 9.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-523c092ee4b03297a85b1914\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-20T08:51:34.850Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain's public finances were a little better than expected in August.</strong> The monthly deficit came in at \u00a313.157bn, compared with estimates of around \u00a313.3bn.

The minutes point out that that the RBI has struggled with this in the past:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What is equally worrisome is that inflation at the retail level, measured by the CPI, has been high for a number of years, entrenching inflation expectations at elevated levels and eroding consumer and business confidence. Although better prospects of a robust kharif harvest will lead to some moderation in CPI inflation, there is no room for complacency.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>A rate hike usually pushes currencies up</strong>. However, the rupee promptly dived as the news hit the wires, as traders realised that the&#xa0;RBI was also cutting some of the exceptional measures introduced to support its currency. The rupee fell from 61.7 to the dollar to as low as 62.55.</p> <p>Stocks also fell on the Indian stock market -- with the Sensex sliding over 2.1% so far today.</p> <p>* - <em>for the record, the RBI trimmed its&#xa0;marginal standing facility rate by 75 basis points from 10.25 to 9.5 per cent, and cut the minimum proportion of the cash reserve ratio that banks must maintain at the RBI from 99 per cent to 95 per cent.</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-20T07:55:23.376Z\">at 8.55am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-523bf313e4b07c4cb668e071\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-20T07:10:56.687Z\">8.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Interest in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/20/markets-await-german-elections-india-surprises-with-interest-rate-hike-live#block-523be8e6e4b0ae8bad15bc04\">German election</a>&#xa0;extends to the Asian markets, reports <strong>IG's</strong> man in Melbourne, <strong>Chris Weston</strong>.</p> <p>There's no panic, but investors are calculating how the result will affect eurozone crisis policy.

      "bodyText": "A final word on the weekend's German election. Over in Greece, Helena Smith says the prospect of Angela Merkel taking the helm of government is not going down well. She writes: More than any other person the German chancellor has been identified with the punishing austerity Greeks have been subjected to since their debt-stricken country plunged into crisis. More often than not, Greek media run unflattering pictures of the German chancellor including portraying her in Nazi garb \u2013 moustache and all. Now, nearly half of Greeks (47%) have made their disdain for the leader official telling an opinion poll canvassed by Public Issue that the consequences of her re-election would be \u201csomewhat negative\u201d for Greece. By comparison 10% said they thought it would be positive for the country\u2019s interests. An overwhelming 79% said they had a negative opinion of the chancellor while 75% said they had a negative view of Germany itself. The survey is a stark contrast to the view currently held by prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party coalition which quite clearly is looking to Berlin for salvation as Athens heads towards opening negotiations over a third rescue package. As the main provided of bailout funds to date, it is hoped Europe\u2019s powerhouse will tone down the pressure whatever government gets in. Greek officials are assuming that Frau Merkel will pip her opponents to the finishing line - and that it will be better to deal with the devil they know. And on that note, ahead of the weekend's poll, its time to draw the blog to a close. Thanks for all the comments and see you next week. Still with the Fed, after his remarks earlier, senior official James Bullard told a New York audience that the central bank could afford to be patient on deciding when to cut back QE. The remarks are in contrast to the hawkish views of fellow Fed member Esther George. Bullard said that while he expected inflation to rise in the coming quarters, he wanted to see evidence of this before endorsing less accommodative policy action by the Fed. The prospects of tapering would harden if payroll and unemployment data recovered further, he added. (From Reuters) Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, is repeating her view that the central bank should have eased off on its bond buying programme. In a speech in New York she said the decision not to taper was disappointing, and that \"costly steps\" were taken to prepare markets for a change to the quantitative easing programme. She said the Fed risked a confusing message on when it would begin tapering, or cutting back, on QE. However she added that sometimes markets get it wrong, and cannot be allowed to dictate policy. She said she wanted to reduce the pace of QE because of lower unemployment and sufficiently positive data. The Fed would have to move gradually on eventually raising rates. Waiting for more evidence (as Fed chairman Ben Bernanke had argued) discounted the very real economic progress made. And she added that the Fed's credibility was now at risk: reducing QE would have allowed markets to adjust gradually. The Fed needed credibility and clear communications to ask markets to trust its forward guidance. (Courtesy Reuters) European markets have ended the day lower, as the Fed fuelled rally ran out of steam. After the rally when the US central bank chairman Ben Bernanke decided not to turn off the money taps, investors turned to other matters, notably the German election and the US budget wrangles. Fed member James Bullard also rekindled the uncertainty by hinting the Fed might begin easing its $85bn a month bond buying programme in October. Here are the final scores on the doors: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finnished 28.96 points or 0.44% lower at 6596.43 \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.21% at 8675.73 \u2022 France's Cac closed off 0.06% points at 4203.66 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB dipped 0.49% to 17970.12 \u2022 But Spain's Ibex ended up 0.2% at 9171.8 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 83 points ore 0.53% lower. Here's some Friday night ratings action: On Malta Fitch said: There has been significant fiscal slippage. Malta's general government deficit was 3.3% of GDP in 2012, well above both the government's target (2.2%) and Fitch's September 2012 forecast (2.6% of GDP). This slippage has carried over to 2013, when Fitch forecasts a deficit of 3.6% of GDP, compared with 2.7% in the original 2013 budget. The European Commission has re-opened the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) against Malta, with the deadline for correcting the excessive deficit set for 2014. In its previous rating review (September 2012), Fitch identified material fiscal slippage in 2012 as a negative rating trigger. And on Croatia being cut to junk: Croatia's fiscal outlook has deteriorated since Fitch's previous sovereign rating review in November 2012. The agency has revised up its forecast for this year's general government deficit to 4.7% in 2013 from 3.9%, while general government debt/GDP is now expected to peak at 66% of GDP in 2016, up from our previous forecast of 62%. A structurally weak growth outlook has impaired the prospects for fiscal consolidation and the attainment of public debt sustainability. A look at the possible problems facing Angela Merkel should she win the German election this weekend, courtesy of the Wall Street Journal. A taster below with the full story here: Angela Merkel has become Europe's most popular leader by telling Germans they don't need to change, and by shielding them from much of Europe's debt-crisis pain at the same time. But as Ms. Merkel heads into a likely third term as Germany's chancellor, there are increasing calls from the business community, which she has counted among her most loyal supporters, and others for her to move more quickly to confront simmering domestic problems that they worry will eventually endanger German prosperity. The time to fix the problems\u2014energy costs, worn-out roads and gaps in education among them\u2014is now, they say, while the economy is healthy. In the corporate world, Vodafone has received clearance from the European Commission for its takeover of Kabel Deutschland, and with that final hurdle passed, the deal is expected to be completed on 14 October. Eurozone consumer confidence rose to a two year high in September, according to new figures from the European Commission, but is still in negative territory. The index rose to -14.9 from -15.6 in August, compared to expectations of a figure of around -15. The news that strong German and French growth had helped pull the eurozone out of recession clearly helped sentiment, although the recovery remains fragile, as evidenced by Italy cutting its growth forecasts earlier today. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Consumer confidence is expected to have supported by the relative good news on the development of the EMU economy (that has finally emerged from a 6-quarter recession). News that the ECB is willing to maintain the current accommodative policy might have also played a role as households see reduced risks to their disposable income in the future. On the other hand, the still high unemployment rate and geopolitical uncertainties are likely to have put a lid on a more pronounced uptick in September. Wall Street has opened lower, not surprisingly given Fed official James Bullard's comments that tapering might begin in October. The Fed gave markets at boost following Wednesday's surprise decision by the US central bank to maintain its $85bn a month bond buying programme. But after Bullard's hint, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 22 points or 0.14% in early trading. However the Nasdaq had edged higher, up 0.15%, helped by a near 3% rise in Apple shares on the day queues form for the tech giant's latest iPhones. More German polling figures, showing the SPD and AfD edging up: Across the Atlantic, observers are still trying to get their heads around Ben Bernanke's decision on Wednesday not to start scaling back the US Federal Reserve's $85bn a month bond buying programme. Most economists had expected a move to wean the markets off the quantitative easing fix this month, but Bernanke pointed to the US economy still being too fragile. But today Fed official James Bullard suggested to Bloomberg that the so-called tapering might now start in October. So we have all the \"will-they-won't-they\" speculation to look forward to for another few weeks yet. Budget airline Ryanair has promised to mend its ways, after being rebuked about its \"abrupt\" culture by shareholders today. Reuters writes: Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, has promised to transform its \"abrupt culture\" in a bid to win customers from costlier rivals, admitting for the first time that a reputation for treating its passengers badly might have become a problem. The Irish firm, this week voted the worst of the 100 biggest brands serving the British market by readers of consumer magazine Which?, said on Friday it would become more lenient on fining customers over bag sizes and overhaul the way it communicates. \"We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off,\" chief executive Michael O'Leary told the company's annual general meeting, after several shareholders complained about the impact of customer service on sales. That's the spirit. More here: Ryanair must stop 'unnecessarily pissing people off', says O'Leary And on that note, I'm going to fly home. Nick Fletcher has the controls. Thanks for reading and commenting. Maybe see you online on Sunday night for the election excitement? Our foreign team will be all over it, and I'll be on Twitter as @graemewearden as usual. New polling data from Germany has just been released, showing that Sunday's election is neck-and-neck with neither side on track for a clear majority. The poll from Forsa found that the current CDU/CSU-FDP coalition would win 45% of the vote, as would their main rivals. Another key point, the eurosceptics Alternative For Germany would not hit the 5% threshold. CDU/CSU 40%. SPD 26%. Greens 10%. LINKE 9%. FDP 5% AfD 4% Pirates 2% I didn't mention earlier, but the SDP has ruled out forming a government with the more left-wing Linke party, given its views on foreign affairs and its opposition to NATO. That could change in the heat of coalition talks, of course. Today's UK public finance figures mean George Osborne is on track to hit his fiscal targets for this year. My colleague Katie Allen explains all: A drop in government spending helped cut Britain's borrowing last month, prompting economists to forecast that the chancellor is on track to meet his fiscal target for this year. Borrowing for the last financial year as a whole was also revised down slightly by the Office for National Statistics as it published data on the public finances. As mentioned earlier, Britain ran a deficit of \u00a313.2bn in August - smaller than last year's \u00a314.4bn. Katie continues: The government's progress on cutting Britain's deficit \u2013 the gap between the government's income and spending \u2013 was described as \"painfully slow\" by one business group. But analysts said the public finances appeared to be on an improving trend. More here: Osborne on track to meet fiscal target as UK public borrowing falls In the City, the Foxton's estate agent chain continues to enjoy a stellar first day on the stock market. Its shares are up 20% this morning, at 277p from the 230p it floated at. The FT says it shows \"a recovery in both share offerings and the residential property market in the UK\". Joshua Raymond, chief marketing strategist of Cityindex.co.uk, calls it a \"hugely impressive\" debut, and deliciously timed, too. With London house prices shooting in the midst of a pricing bubble thanks in part to the Help to Buy Scheme, investors are trying to gain exposure to firms that directly benefit from this and as such the Foxtons IPO could not have been better timed in terms of its attractiveness. Or as one fund manager puts it: Thanks to BigBlue80 for flagging up the polling data which suggests Angela Merkel's current CDU-CSU/FDP coalition would not get enough votes to return to power. Speaking of eurosceptics.... The Italian government has bowed to the inevitable today, tearing up its growth targets and admitting that its budget deficit is heading over target. Enrico Letta's government cut its forecast for 2013 to a contraction of -1.7%, down from -1.3% before. In 2014, it expects growth of 1%, down from 1.3%. Both forecasts remain more optimistic than the IMF's own targets -- the Fund expects a 1.8% contraction in 2013 and a 0.7% expansion in 2014. That difference could matter -- on Letta's calculations, the Italian deficit is on track to hit 3.1% this year. That's over the EU's target, and econony minister Fabrizio Saccomanni told reporters that it will be \"corrected quickly\". Sounds like the EU are putting pressure over the deficit too: Saccomanni also predicted that Italy's two-year recession will end soon, with GDP flat this quarter and then rising in the last three months of this year. Tony Connelly, Europe Editor for RTE News, reports that the eurosceptic Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party are in good spirits ahead of Sunday's election. Party loyalists are confident they'll win enough support to claim seats in the Bundestag. They're also looking ahead to next year's European elections. Emma Tunney, an intern with Open Europe, attended one of Angela Merkel's campaign rallies this week, and writes that Europe was only raised late in the chancellor's speech: Here her stance was clear \u2013 Germany must hold the course. Germany\u2019s continued commitment to help its friends is necessary, that said she was quick to add that Germany had every right to expect those receiving assistance make meaningful changes to their financial systems. Her assertion of a CDU rejection of the possibility of mutualizing European debt was well received, and was perhaps the most definitive statement on what we could expect should she become Chancellor once again. Parish notice: my colleagues on the foreign desk have been tracking the twists and turns of the German general election in their own blog: German Elections Blog 2013. From Berlin, my colleague Philip Oltermann flags up that the unfolding story of how US intelligence have been accessing Europe's electronic communications was raised by Peer Steinbr\u00fcck yesterday, The NSA affair became a German election issue on Thursday when Social Democrat candidate Peer Steinbr\u00fcck accused Angela Merkel of \"negligent\" treatment of the issue. He said the revelations of US internet surveillance represented a \"far-reaching interference with our basic democratic rights and personal self-determination\", and that Merkel had failed to \"protect German citizens' freedoms and interests\". More here: Peer Steinbr\u00fcck accuses Angela Merkel of negligence over NSA revelations Electionista has crunched the recent polling data and concluded that Angela Merkel's CDU-CSU/FDP coalition has just a 50.5% chance of winning a majority on Sunday: On that point.... Here AP's latest dispatch from the German political frontline. It explains how the Free Democrat party are battling to hit the crucial 5% mark to get into the Bundestag. Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and her struggling coalition partners were fighting over votes Friday in the final stretch of campaigning for Germany's election as polls pointed to a tight outcome. Merkel is heavily favored to emerge from Sunday's election with a third term, but her hopes of continuing the current coalition of her conservatives and the pro-market Free Democrats are in the balance. A ZDF television poll conducted Wednesday and Thursday showed a statistically insignificant one-point lead for the alliance over the combined opposition in line with other recent surveys showing a dead heat. The Free Democrats are pushing hard for Merkel supporters' votes after being ejected from Bavaria's state legislature in a regional vote last weekend. In national polls, they're hovering around the 5 percent support needed to keep their seats in Parliament. Merkel and her conservative Union bloc are pushing back, saying they have no votes to give away. If the coalition loses its majority, the likeliest outcome would be a \"grand coalition\" between Merkel's party and the center-left Social Democrats and the conservatives want to be as strong as possible. \"I would advise us all in the final hours before the election to fight our political opponents and not argue over each other's votes,\" Bavarian governor Horst Seehofer, who led Merkel's conservative bloc to victory there, told the daily Die Welt. The Free Democrats have \"potential of well over 5 percent,\" he was quoted as saying. They won nearly 15% at the last election. \"I think it's a very strange understanding of democracy when the impression is raised that citizens' votes belong to the chancellor,\" the Free Democrats' general secretary, Patrick Doering, shot back on n-tv television. ZDF's poll of 1,369 people gave Merkel's conservatives 40 percent support and the Free Democrats 5.5%. Challenger Peer Steinbrueck's Social Democrats polled 27%, their Green allies 9% and the hard-line Left Party with which the center-left parties say they won't work 8.5%. The poll showed a new anti-euro party, Alternative for Germany, at 4% not enough to win parliamentary seats. It gave a margin of error of plus or minus up to three percentage points. But do note the caveat from earlier - some analysts think AfD are doing better than that..... Looking back at the German election... here's a handy graphic showing how last night's polling data would translate into seats in the Bundestag: The CDU's 266 seats,plus the FDP's 37, would give the current coalition a small majority --which could make for some tight votes on future eurozone policy. On a lighter note, there's a correction in the Financial Times today that deserves a wide audience (with many thanks to Luke Baker of Reuters) Britain's public finances were a little better than expected in August. The monthly deficit came in at \u00a313.157bn, compared with estimates of around \u00a313.3bn. Government revenues rose by 1.4%, and spending dipped by 2.2%. So far this year, the UK had borrowed \u00a346.8bn to balance the books, compared to \u00a350.5bn for the first eight months of 2012. More to follow.

The initial rally sparked by the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday not to taper its stimulus package has worn off, and traders appear to be hunkering down ahead of the German election. The German stock market has been pulled down by a profit warning from Adidas last night. Adidas blamed adverse currency effects, a distribution problem in Russia and poor trading at its golf business. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 6 points at 6618, down 0.1% \u2022 German DAX: down 9 points at 8681, down 0.12% \u2022 French CAC: down 5 points at 4200,-0.12% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 1 point at 18056, - 0.01% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 11 points at 9,165, +0.13% Here's some early reaction to India's surprise interest rate decision, which I've taken from Reuters. Anjali Verma, chief economist at PhillipCapital: Hiking the repo rate was unexpected. The governor is clearly worried about inflation. He is saying the improved international conditions will take care of the current account deficit funding and his focus will shift to fiscal deficit and inflation, which were taking a backseat. Anubhuti Sahay, economist at Standard Chartered: The statement clearly has a strong hawkish bias as it states that with a relatively more stable exchange rate, monetary policy formulation will be determined once again by internal determinants viz inflation and fiscal deficit. Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank: The long-term signal is that the RBI is still concerned with inflation. Easing short end of the curve, which it has done by cutting the MSF (marginal standing facility), reducing CRR requirements and etc. is a strong pro-growth signal. I think it (MSF) might be reduced even further. India's new central bank governor Raghuram Rajan made a splashy debut in the monetary policy world this morning. The Reserve Bank of India surprised the markets by announcing a quarter-point rise in India's headline interest rate, from 7.25% to 7.5%. However, the RBI also announced that it will unwind some of the \"exceptional measures\" put in place to support the Indian Rupee, after it slumped to record lows against the US dollar this summer. Rajan's message with today's rate hike is that the RBI will make fighting India's inflation problem its top priority. The cost of living is rising at 6.1% in India. As Rajan put it in today's statement: Bringing down inflation to more tolerable levels warrants raising the repo rate by 25 basis points immediately. The RBI raised rates despite recognising that the Indian economy is weakening, with \"continuing sluggishness in industrial activity and service.\" Clearly, Rajan is showing that he's taking price stability as his mantra. The minutes point out that that the RBI has struggled with this in the past: What is equally worrisome is that inflation at the retail level, measured by the CPI, has been high for a number of years, entrenching inflation expectations at elevated levels and eroding consumer and business confidence. Although better prospects of a robust kharif harvest will lead to some moderation in CPI inflation, there is no room for complacency. A rate hike usually pushes currencies up. However, the rupee promptly dived as the news hit the wires, as traders realised that the RBI was also cutting some of the exceptional measures introduced to support its currency. The rupee fell from 61.7 to the dollar to as low as 62.55. Stocks also fell on the Indian stock market -- with the Sensex sliding over 2.1% so far today. * - for the record, the RBI trimmed its marginal standing facility rate by 75 basis points from 10.25 to 9.5 per cent, and cut the minimum proportion of the cash reserve ratio that banks must maintain at the RBI from 99 per cent to 95 per cent. Interest in the German election extends to the Asian markets, reports IG's man in Melbourne, Chris Weston. There's no panic, but investors are calculating how the result will affect eurozone crisis policy. He writes: The market sees the election really going one of two ways; either the status quo is resumed (i.e. CDU, CSU and FDP remain in power) or perhaps a grand coalition with the SPD party is put together after a short period of negotiations. Given the SPD's previous positive stance on backing a redemption fund, backed by Eurobonds, if they did help govern in future we could see a spike in EUR/USD on the prospect of a more euro-friendly government in place. On the other hand if the AfD (right wing, anti-euro party) get over 5% of votes and thus gain representation in parliament, we could see EUR and US futures gap lower on Monday. Eurozone concerns have had limited influence on price action of late, but the prospect of having the AfD party having representation in parliament could have implications on eurozone policy going forward. The first thing that springs to mind is Greece. We know the Greeks have a funding problem; the IMF talked openly about it July; highlighting a \u20ac4.4bn funding gap in its current program for 2014 and \u20ac6.5bn in 2015. Given all new loans have to be fully agreed on in the Bundestag (German lower house of parliament); AfD representation in parliament could cause disruptions and uncertainty here. Angela Merkel and Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the SPD's candidate for the chancellorship, held election rallies last night in a late drive to win votes before Sunday's election (see opening post) Both politicians attracted a healthy turnout of supporters, as these photos show: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Germany's general election has loomed over the eurozone for most of 2013. Finally, it's all-but upon us. Germans head to the polls on Sunday in a crunch poll that will determine how Europe's largest countryeconomy is governed for the next four years. There's no doubt that Angela Merkel's CDU-CSU party will win the most votes. But there's real uncertainty over whether her coalition with the Free Democrats can be repeated, or whether we'll see a grand coalition with left-leaning rivals. Poll after poll this week have confirmed that it's just too close to call (do make your predictions in the comments). The latest survey, released last night by FGW, suggested that Merkel's coalition would just win enough votes to take power again. It put CDU at 40%, the Social Democrats at 27%, FDP at 5.5%, Linke at 8.5%, the Greens at 9%, and then the eurosceptic Alternative for Deutscheland at 4% (not enough to win seats). So, that's the CDU-FDP on 45.5%, and other major parties at 44.5%. The key factor is that a party needs 5% of votes to actually get into the Bundestag. And the whisper in Germany (and in the comments section of this blog this week) is the AfD might be doing better than the pollsters believe. If AfD clear the 5% mark, as some polls have suggested, then German politics will be dramatically shaken up. Here's what some respected euro journalists have been tweeting: So, the eyes of Europe could be on Germany this weekend, and for sometime after if it's an unclear result. Traders in the City are already watching with interest, as CMC's Michael Hewson writes: It still remains uncertain as to what the electoral maths will be with respect to any new coalition government. A rising Eurosceptic movement in Germany could well complicate things significantly after a poll by German newspaper Bild showed that the AfD party could well be on course for more than 5% of the vote in the election this weekend. A move above this threshold would mean that the party would gain seats in the Bundestag and as such would mean that they would have much greater influence over policy as well as make the likelihood of a less stable coalition a real possibility as neither the CDU, or the SPD would have enough votes to form a government with any prospective coalition partners. I'll be tracking events through the day as usual. We've already had one piece of interesting news outside Europe -- India's central bank has surprised the markets by raising interest rates. More on that shortly....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Office of Fair Trading has accused a leading underwear company and the UK's three biggest department stores of a price stitch-up that had added up to \u00a31.50 to the cost of sports bras. John Lewis, Debenhams and House of Fraser are alleged to have struck anti-competitive deals with DB Apparel UK over their range of Shock Absorber sports bras. It is thought to be the first time that John Lewis \u2013 lauded for its democratic staff ownership model and customer service \u2013 has faced an OFT investigation. The watchdog claimed on Friday that the underwear firm and the stores had committed a serious breach of competition law by agreeing fixed or minimum prices for the bras. Following a 17-month investigation into the sports bra market, the OFT said that DB Apparel had made nine anti-competitive agreements with the stores between 2008 and 2011, with the aim of increasing the price. During this period, Shock Absorber bras had a 15% share of the market. The alleged collusion added between 50p and \u00a31.50 to the cost of bras. Shock Absorber bras are being sold for between \u00a325 and \u00a338 on Debenhams' website and have been promoted by Anna Kournikova and former Gladiators star Kate Staples. The OFT launched the sports bra investigation, after another UK retailer complained that DB Apparel had refused to supply them with Shock Absorber products because they declined to sell them at their minimum prices. DB Apparel and the stores can challenge the OFT's findings before the regulator reaches a final decision in March 2014. If the allegations are upheld, the parties could in theory be fined up to 10% of their annual worldwide turnover. \"The OFT takes allegations of price fixing seriously,\" said Ann Pope, senior director of services, infrastructure and public markets at the OFT. \"Resale price maintenance limits competition between retailers and can lead to consumers paying higher prices.\" She added: \"We will carefully consider the parties' representations before deciding whether competition law has in fact been infringed.\" DB Apparel rejected the allegations of anti-competitive behaviour. A spokesperson said: \"We have been transparent with UK authorities since the beginning of this process and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this investigation.\" All three department stores reject the charges. The sports bra charges come after six carpet and furniture retailers were accused by the OFT of \"fake prices\" to exaggerate sales and price cuts. The OFT opened an investigation last month after finding that many retailers in the sector were misleading customers into thinking they were getting a bargain by artificially inflating the original price. The regulator has also taken on the supermarkets for \"yo-yo pricing\" - the artificial inflation of prices to make discounts more attractive - but consumer watchdogs are sceptical that a voluntary code that it got the supermarkets to sign up to will make any difference. In 2011 the OFT's reputation took a tumble when it closed a two-year probe into price fixing among sports clothing retailers JJB Sports and Sports Direct without any charges. John Lewis, Debenhams and House of Fraser all said they were co-operating with the OFT. A John Lewis spokesperson said: \"John Lewis always strives to operate within the law and comply with regulations. We are fully cooperating with the OFT and will respond in due course.\" Debenhams said the matter was in the hands of external lawyers: \"Debenhams disputes these provisional findings of the OFT but is not in a position to comment further at this stage.\" House of Fraser said it was \"co-operating fully with the Office of Fair Trading and the ongoing investigation and will respond accordingly\". The company added: \"We are confident that we have been operating within all laws and regulations and are very supportive of any initiative which ensures pricing policies are fair for our customers.\"",

    "webTitle": "Osborne on track to meet fiscal target as UK public borrowing falls", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A drop in government spending helped cut UK borrowing last month, prompting economists to forecast that the chancellor is on track to meet his fiscal target for this year. Borrowing for the last financial year as a whole was also revised down slightly by the Office for National Statistics as it published data on the public finances. The ONS said the government's preferred measure of public borrowing, which strips out some of the effects of its bank bailouts, showed a deficit of \u00a313.2bn in August. That was smaller than \u00a314.4bn a year earlier and also slightly under the \u00a313.5bn consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. The government's progress on cutting Britain's deficit \u2013 the gap between the government's income and spending \u2013 was described as \"painfully slow\" by one business group. However, analysts said the public finances appeared to be on an improving trend and any pickup in the economy could help further as tax receipts rise and the benefits bill falls thanks to unemployment coming down. The government's target for borrowing in this financial year is \u00a3120bn, little change from last year, when borrowing came in at \u00a3115.7bn. August's outcome, which was helped by a drop in spending by government departments, takes the cumulative borrowing for this financial year to date to \u00a338bn. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, noted that figure was \"well down\" on \u00a348bn two years ago and \u00a357bn three years ago, while last year's numbers were distorted by one-off effects. He said that even without monthly numbers for the rest of the year showing an improvement compared with the same month a year ago, \"full-year borrowing will be a fraction under \u00a3100bn\" \u2013 meaning the chancellor comfortably makes his target. \"There is a good case for an even better number, especially now that the macro data have started to outperform,\" added Clarke. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, said there was a chance the full year would even beat next year's \u00a3108bn borrowing target. \"The chancellor therefore faces a more comfortable time at his autumn statement than he has for a while, with the prospect of reporting against a background of stronger growth and better public finances than was envisaged at the budget in March,\" he said. But he added a note of caution: \"However, just to put things into perspective, borrowing for 2013/14 at the time of Mr Osborne's first budget in June 2010 was envisaged to be running at just \u00a360bn. Hence there is still some way to go before the chancellor's task is complete.\" The Treasury has come under fire from business groups for not cutting Britain's deficit fast enough and at the same time from trade unions and opposition MPs for pushing ahead with austerity measures to the cost of both growth and family finances. Osborne's office welcomed the latest public finance numbers. \"Borrowing is down this month, and revisions show that borrowing this year and last year was lower than previously thought. The economy is turning a corner, but there is a long way to go and the government is sticking to the economic plan that has already cut the deficit by a third and enabled the private sector to create over 1.4m new jobs,\" said a spokesman. But the British Chambers of Commerce said the deficit was still \"unsustainably high\". The business group's chief economist, David Kern, said: \"The improvement in economic growth seen in recent months will help to reduce the deficit further, but progress remains painfully slow. The weakening of our financial sector and drop in oil and gas reserves have created a hole in our public finances, and our ability to generate tax revenues will struggle to return to pre-recession levels, even when the pace of growth picks up.\"",

That was smaller than \u00a314.4bn a year earlier and also slightly under the \u00a313.5bn consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.</p> <p>The government's progress on cutting Britain's deficit \u2013 the gap between the government's income and spending \u2013 was described as \"painfully slow\" by one business group. However, analysts said the public finances appeared to be on an improving trend and any pickup in the economy could help further as tax receipts rise and the benefits bill falls thanks to unemployment coming down.</p> <p>The government's target for borrowing in this financial year is \u00a3120bn, little change from last year, when borrowing came in at \u00a3115.7bn.</p> <p>August's outcome, which was helped by a drop in spending by government departments, takes the cumulative borrowing for this financial year to date to \u00a338bn. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, noted that figure was \"well down\" on \u00a348bn two years ago and \u00a357bn three years ago, while last year's numbers were distorted by one-off effects.</p> <p>He said that even without monthly numbers for the rest of the year showing an improvement compared with the same month a year ago, \"full-year borrowing will be a fraction under \u00a3100bn\" \u2013 meaning the chancellor comfortably makes his target.</p> <p>\"There is a good case for an even better number, especially now that the macro data have started to outperform,\" added Clarke.</p> <p>Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, said there was a chance the full year would even beat next year's \u00a3108bn borrowing target.</p> <p>\"The chancellor therefore faces a more comfortable time at his autumn statement than he has for a while, with the prospect of reporting against a background of stronger growth and better public finances than was envisaged at the budget in March,\" he said.</p> <p>But he added a note of caution: \"However, just to put things into perspective, borrowing for 2013/14 at the time of Mr Osborne's first budget in June 2010 was envisaged to be running at just \u00a360bn. Hence there is still some way to go before the chancellor's task is complete.\"</p> <p>The Treasury has come under fire from business groups for not cutting Britain's deficit fast enough and at the same time from trade unions and opposition MPs for pushing ahead with austerity measures to the cost of both growth and family finances. Osborne's office welcomed the latest public finance numbers.</p> <p>\"Borrowing is down this month, and revisions show that borrowing this year and last year was lower than previously thought. The economy is turning a corner, but there is a long way to go and the government is sticking to the economic plan that has already cut the deficit by a third and enabled the private sector to create over 1.4m new jobs,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>But the British Chambers of Commerce said the deficit was still \"unsustainably high\". The business group's chief economist, David Kern, said: \"The improvement in economic growth seen in recent months will help to reduce the deficit further, but progress remains painfully slow. The weakening of our financial sector and drop in oil and gas reserves have created a hole in our public finances, and our ability to generate tax revenues will struggle to return to pre-recession levels, even when the pace of growth picks up.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Foxtons, the famously pushy estate agent, saw its share price soar on its stock market debut on Friday, as record London property prices fuelled investor interest. Shares in the company hit highs of 286p in early trading, up 56p from the selling price, which was at the top end of the range. The sales and lettings agent, known for its hefty commissions and fleet of dark green liveried Mini Coopers, is valued at \u00a3649m. Investor interest in Foxtons has been strong, amid soaring house prices in London, where almost all of Foxtons' 44 branches are located. Data this week revealed that London house prices had risen almost 10% in a year to an average of \u00a3438,000. Foxtons has performed strongly this year, with underlying profits up 14.3% to \u00a319.4m in the first six months. The chain, which was founded in Notting Hill in 1981, focuses on selling properties between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a31.4m. It charges an average commission of 2.5%. In 2012 its average sale price was \u00a3476,000 and it handled one in three of the house sales in the City and a quarter of the flat sales in upmarket Ladbroke Grove. Joe Rundle, head of capital at ETX Capital, described Foxton's debut as stunning. He added that low interest rates, continued government initiatives to induce first-time buyers and the general optimism over the global economic recovery, were lifting the outlook for Foxtons and other stocks geared to a UK housing market recovery, especially in London.",
