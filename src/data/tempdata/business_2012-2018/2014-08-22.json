      "bodyText": "BT is to impose a price increase of over 6% on its home phone and broadband customers in a move that has already been dubbed a \"football tax\". The company, which has 7.3 million home phone and broadband customers, said that from 1 December the cost of a BT landline \u2013 mandatory for phone and high-speed internet \u2013 will rise by \u00a31 to \u00a316.99. At the same time the cost of its broadband service will also rise above inflation by up to 6.49%. The hike is nearly four times higher than the current rate of inflation, which was 1.6% last month under the consumer prices index measure. Announcing the price hike, John Petter, chief executive of BT's consumer division, said the company was \"sensitive to the tough economic times\". However, one expert asked whether the increase will appeal to customers who have no interest in sports following BT's expensive outlay on football rights since 2012 and might question whether they are being forced to subsidise BT's football coverage. Dominic Baliszewski, telecoms expert at broadbandchoices.co.uk, said: \"Some people may see this as a 'football tax', but BT Sport is still incredibly competitive, with a huge amount of content for no extra monthly cost. Sports fans will very happy, but if you're not one, then your best bet may be to switch.\" In 2012 BT surprised analysts when it paid \u00a3738m to show 38 live Premiership football matches over three years. It has since added a host of other TV sports rights, including a surprise \u00a31bn deal to broadcast the Champions League, and is taking on BSkyB in the paid-for sports and broadband markets. BT's two sports channels are offered free to its broadband customers and are sold as an add-on to those viewing the channels on rival TV platforms such as Virgin Media. Announcing the Champions League last year, BT chief executive Gavin Patterson said: \"We can assure people who want to catch all the action that European football will be far more accessible and affordable with BT.\" From December BT phone customers will being paying more than \u00a3200 a year in landline charges alone, although they can reduce this to \u00a3170 if they prepay for the year. The company's formerly free answerphone (1571) service rises to \u00a322.20 a year. To try to offset the accusation that it is making its customers pay for its sports outlay, BT has launched a new Home Phone Saver aimed at the 2.6 million customers who buy a phone service only. It will cost \u00a319.99 a month, and includes the landline fee plus free calls to other landlines. Petter said: \"We've taken care to make sure that low-income customers avoid price increases. We've added extra money-saving options for low-income customers and for customers who only want a phone line for calls. \"Although some prices have gone up, we want to help our customers to find the best value BT option with Right Plan.\" BT is not the only phone company to raise charges recently. Earlier this month TalkTalk upped the cost of buying its landline a year in advance from \u00a3141 to \u00a3172.20 a year.",

Mario Draghi\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole includes a call for a change to the eurozone\u2019s austerity programmes to stimulate growth.</strong></p> <p>Here\u2019s the key section from the ECB president\u2019s speech:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Turning to fiscal policy, since 2010 the euro area has suffered from fiscal policy being less available and effective, especially compared with other large advanced economies. This is not so much a consequence of high initial debt ratios \u2013 public debt is in aggregate not higher in the euro area than in the US or Japan. It reflects the fact that the central bank in those countries could act and has acted as a backstop for government funding. This is an important reason why markets spared their fiscal authorities the loss of confidence that constrained many euro area governments\u2019 market access. This has in turn allowed fiscal consolidation in the US and Japan to be more backloaded.</p> <p>Thus, it would be helpful for the overall stance of policy if fiscal policy could play a greater role alongside monetary policy, and I believe there is scope for this, while taking into account our specific initial conditions and legal constraints. These initial conditions include levels of government expenditure and taxation in the euro area that are, in relation to GDP, already among the highest in the world. And we are operating within a set of fiscal rules \u2013 the Stability and Growth Pact \u2013 which acts as an anchor for confidence and that would be self-defeating to break.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>He then calls for growth-friendly fiscal policies to encourage a pick up in activity in the whole region.</strong><br></p> <p>Draghi makes four suggestions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, the existing flexibility within the rules could be used to better address the weak recovery and to make room for the cost of needed structural reforms.</p> <p>Second, there is leeway to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. As a start, it should be possible to lower the tax burden in a budget-neutral way. <sup>[<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2014/html/sp140822.en.html#footnote.15\">15</a>]</sup> This strategy could have positive effects even in the short-term if taxes are lowered in those areas where the short-term fiscal multiplier is higher, and expenditures cut in unproductive areas where the multiplier is lower. Research suggests positive second-round effects on business confidence and private investment could also be achieved in the short-term. <sup>[<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2014/html/sp140822.en.html#footnote.16\">16</a>]</sup></p> <p>Third, in parallel it may be useful to have a discussion on the overall fiscal stance of the euro area. Unlike in other major advanced economies, our fiscal stance is not based on a single budget voted for by a single parliament, but on the aggregation of eighteen national budgets and the EU budget. Stronger coordination among the different national fiscal stances should in principle allow us to achieve a more growth-friendly overall fiscal stance for the euro area.</p> <p>Fourth, complementary action at the EU level would also seem to be necessary to ensure both an appropriate aggregate position and a large public investment programme \u2013 which is consistent with proposals by the incoming President of the European Commission. <sup>[<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2014/html/sp140822.en.html#footnote.17\">17</a>]</sup></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-22T19:00:16.462Z\">at 8.00pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53f790c8e4b0f9d94d61ed10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-22T18:50:51.423Z\">7.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Mario Draghi is defending the eurozone\u2019s austerity measure (which many experts criticise for undermining the recovery and causing long-term damage).</p> <p>He argues it was essential to rebuild market confidence;

Whilst clearly Yellen gives more weight to the former arguments, she also acknowledged that the labour market had made improvements.</p> <p>As such, this was classic, economist \u201c\u2026On the one hand\u2026 and on the other\u2026\u201d, and gives nothing away. The key theme might be summarised as \u201cUncertainty\u201d. And the Fed typically likes to play safe with monetary policy when it is unsure.</p> <p>That said, we continue to think that the tone of the FOMC in September will be somewhat more hawkish than it has been recently, and look to recent FOMC minutes as a hint in this direction. This is not to say that there will be a sea-change in the Fed\u2019s stance, but enough of a shift to encourage thoughts of an earlier-than-expected first Fed rate hike, and possibly cause a bit more selling pressure at the front end of the yield curve and dollar strength.</p> <p>We also think that the chances of an April 2015 rate hike remain good, with the economy picking up pace in recent months, and leaving the housing-related and weather weakness of 1H2014 behind.</p> <p>Whilst it is tempting to think that this may result in an eventual and perhaps sharp rise in longer dated bond yields, evidence so far this year is building that the economy continues to need low bond yields in order to make progress, and as such, any sell offs are likely to be self-defeating and short-lived. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53f75917e4b043d12a9b99d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-22T14:53:41.353Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This word cloud shows how \u2018Labor\u2019 and \u2018Market\u2019 dominates Janet Yellen\u2019s speech, with \u201cinflation\u201d coming behind:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MKTWgoldstein/statuses/502830343477424128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The word cloud of Yellen&#39;s speech <a href=\"http://t.co/6kzkZIThoa\">http://t.co/6kzkZIThoa</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/nY1ol01JvK\">pic.twitter.com/nY1ol01JvK</a></p>&mdash; Steve Goldstein (@MKTWgoldstein) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MKTWgoldstein/statuses/502830343477424128\">August 22, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53f755d6e4b014e5f82174f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-22T14:46:01.553Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There\u2019s a fairly muted reaction to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/22/co-op-bank-cuts-staff-edf-fine-janet-yellen-business-live#block-53f74d40e4b043d12a9b99c0\">highlights start here</a>). </strong></p> <p>The US dollar has risen against the euro.

If so, the first clear signs of inflation pressure could come later than usual in the progression toward maximum employment.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the official line from the ECB: THIS IS IMPORTANT. Mario Draghi\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole includes a call for a change to the eurozone\u2019s austerity programmes to stimulate growth. Here\u2019s the key section from the ECB president\u2019s speech: Turning to fiscal policy, since 2010 the euro area has suffered from fiscal policy being less available and effective, especially compared with other large advanced economies. This is not so much a consequence of high initial debt ratios \u2013 public debt is in aggregate not higher in the euro area than in the US or Japan. It reflects the fact that the central bank in those countries could act and has acted as a backstop for government funding. This is an important reason why markets spared their fiscal authorities the loss of confidence that constrained many euro area governments\u2019 market access. This has in turn allowed fiscal consolidation in the US and Japan to be more backloaded. Thus, it would be helpful for the overall stance of policy if fiscal policy could play a greater role alongside monetary policy, and I believe there is scope for this, while taking into account our specific initial conditions and legal constraints. These initial conditions include levels of government expenditure and taxation in the euro area that are, in relation to GDP, already among the highest in the world. And we are operating within a set of fiscal rules \u2013 the Stability and Growth Pact \u2013 which acts as an anchor for confidence and that would be self-defeating to break. He then calls for growth-friendly fiscal policies to encourage a pick up in activity in the whole region. Draghi makes four suggestions: First, the existing flexibility within the rules could be used to better address the weak recovery and to make room for the cost of needed structural reforms. Second, there is leeway to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. As a start, it should be possible to lower the tax burden in a budget-neutral way. [15] This strategy could have positive effects even in the short-term if taxes are lowered in those areas where the short-term fiscal multiplier is higher, and expenditures cut in unproductive areas where the multiplier is lower. Research suggests positive second-round effects on business confidence and private investment could also be achieved in the short-term. [16] Third, in parallel it may be useful to have a discussion on the overall fiscal stance of the euro area. Unlike in other major advanced economies, our fiscal stance is not based on a single budget voted for by a single parliament, but on the aggregation of eighteen national budgets and the EU budget. Stronger coordination among the different national fiscal stances should in principle allow us to achieve a more growth-friendly overall fiscal stance for the euro area. Fourth, complementary action at the EU level would also seem to be necessary to ensure both an appropriate aggregate position and a large public investment programme \u2013 which is consistent with proposals by the incoming President of the European Commission. [17] Mario Draghi is defending the eurozone\u2019s austerity measure (which many experts criticise for undermining the recovery and causing long-term damage). He argues it was essential to rebuild market confidence; even though it was his own \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d speech that ACTUALLY calmed the crisis in July 2012. The crux of Mario Draghi\u2019s speech is that the path to higher employment in the euro area is a policy mix that combines monetary, fiscal and structural measures. Mario Draghi, the man who saved the eurozone two years ago by promising to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d, has also flagged up that the US (growing at 4% per year) and the eurozone (stagnating) are diverging. He includes this chart, showing how the eurozone labour market has performed so poorly in different years. BREAKING: Mario Draghi is on his feet at Jackson Hole, and telling fellow top central bankers that the European Central Bank is prepared to take more measures to stimulate the economy if needed. The ECB chief said he and his fellow policymakers stand ready to adjust their policy stance, if circumstances merit it. But he is also saying that he believes the measures announced in June - including hundreds of billions of euros of fresh cheap loans for eurozone banks, will work. The speech is online here: Reaction keeps coming in: Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser of Allianz (and former CEO of bond-trading giant PIMCO), has given Janet Yellen a decent score for today\u2019s speech. Over on Bloomberg, he writes: Her presentation did a great job of framing important analytical issues, setting the tone not only for the subsequent discussions at the conference but also for research that will follow in the weeks and months to come. Specifically, she described the difficulties confronting an assessment of today\u2019s labor market, including the challenges facing an evaluation of the remaining slack in employment. This takes in factors such as the labor participation rate, wage dynamics, involuntary part-time employment and the extent to which the decline in the unemployment rate \u201csomewhat overstates the improvement in overall labor market conditions.\u201d El-Erian also points out that Yellen steered away from global issues, keeping focus on the labor market. Yellen was silent on the issue of how to navigate the intensifying multispeed policy world of central banking in developed countries. Her main dilemma now is how quickly to ease off the monetary-policy accelerator. This is a stark contrast to the challenge facing European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. He is dealing with the question of when and how to step harder on the accelerator. Capital Economics reckons that the Federal Reserve chair has inched back from the more hawkish tone of this month\u2019s monetary policy meeting. They say: If the release of the minutes of July\u2019s FOMC meeting on Wednesday suggested that the Fed had taken two steps closer to raising interest rates, then today\u2019s speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen at Jackson Hole could be interpreted as it taking one step back. However, Capital Economics still expects that the first rate hike will come in March next year, as James Bullard of the St Louis Fed predicted earlier today. After a positive week despite geopolitical tensions - notably the situation in Ukraine - and hints that interest rates in the UK and US may rise sooner than previously thought, European markets paused for breath ahead of the weekend. The closing scores were: The FTSE 100 finished down 2.41 points or 0.04% at 6775.25 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.66% at 9339.17 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.93% lower at 4252.80 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended 0.46% down at 19,917.98 Spain\u2019s Ibex fell 0.53% to 10,500.2 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 8 points or 0.04%. Here\u2019s our Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe, on Janet Yellen\u2019s speech: Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen said on Friday that the US economy was improving but warned there was a \u201cpossibility that the severe recession caused persistent changes in the labour market\u2019s functioning\u201d. Yellen\u2019s first speech at the annual meeting of global central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, focussed largely on the jobs market. \u201cThe economy has made considerable progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of employment in the United States since the Great Depression,\u201d she said. \u201cThese developments are encouraging, but it speaks to the depth of the damage that, five years after the end of the recession, the labour market has yet to fully recover.\u201d The US has now added more than 200,000 jobs each month for six months in a row. Yellen said that despite the improvements the Fed was awaiting more evidence about the health of labour markets before deciding when to start raising interest rates...... More here: Fed chair Janet Yellen cautious in speech on \u2018damaged\u2019 US economy It also appears that geopolitics, rather than events in Wyoming, is weighing on the US stock market. Traders don\u2019t like the sound of Russia\u2019s aid convoy crossing the Ukraine border uninvited. The S&amp;P 500 has dipped by 0.2% to its lowest point of the day. Unfortunately, the Jackson Hole speeches don\u2019t appear to be streamed online anywhere. The next major event is Mario Draghi\u2019s address, in three and a half hour\u2019s time (7.30pm BST, or 2.30pm New York). Draghi\u2019s speech could outline what the European Central Bank is willing, and able, to do to counter the worrying slowdown in the eurozone economy. I\u2019ll aim to post the key points from that speech once it happens (the newswires should have it under embargo) Most pundits had expected Janet Yellen\u2019s speech to be \u201clargely inconsequential\u201d, and that\u2019s exactly what we got. So argues Rob Carnell, ING\u2019s economist, who also provides a handy summary of the key points: Fed chair, Janet Yellen, skirted around the issue of future monetary policy by noting that whilst there were a number of factors that might mean the labour market was less of a threat to inflation than in previous business cycles, equally, there were factors that might make it more so. Whilst clearly Yellen gives more weight to the former arguments, she also acknowledged that the labour market had made improvements. As such, this was classic, economist \u201c\u2026On the one hand\u2026 and on the other\u2026\u201d, and gives nothing away. The key theme might be summarised as \u201cUncertainty\u201d. And the Fed typically likes to play safe with monetary policy when it is unsure. That said, we continue to think that the tone of the FOMC in September will be somewhat more hawkish than it has been recently, and look to recent FOMC minutes as a hint in this direction. This is not to say that there will be a sea-change in the Fed\u2019s stance, but enough of a shift to encourage thoughts of an earlier-than-expected first Fed rate hike, and possibly cause a bit more selling pressure at the front end of the yield curve and dollar strength. We also think that the chances of an April 2015 rate hike remain good, with the economy picking up pace in recent months, and leaving the housing-related and weather weakness of 1H2014 behind. Whilst it is tempting to think that this may result in an eventual and perhaps sharp rise in longer dated bond yields, evidence so far this year is building that the economy continues to need low bond yields in order to make progress, and as such, any sell offs are likely to be self-defeating and short-lived. This word cloud shows how \u2018Labor\u2019 and \u2018Market\u2019 dominates Janet Yellen\u2019s speech, with \u201cinflation\u201d coming behind: There\u2019s a fairly muted reaction to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole (highlights start here). The US dollar has risen against the euro. One euro is now worth $1.323, down half a cent. US bonds have fallen slightly in value, pushing up the yield (interest rate) on 10-year Treasury\u2019s by a mere three basis points to 2.43%, from 2.40%. That suggests her speech hinted at an earlier normalisation of policy: But on the other hand.... Janet Yellen concluded her speech by saying that US interest rates could rise sooner than expected if the labor market improves more rapidly than expected, or if inflation picks up faster. But on the other hand, if \u201ceconomic performance turns out to be disappointing\u201d the Fed could maintain a more accommodative stance for longer. Indeed.... Binyamin Appelbaum of the New York Times sums up the key points: Janet Yellen then outlined the challenge of trying to assess the amount of spare capacity in the labour market. She explains that there\u2019s a risk that the Fed will fail to act fast enough; it could miss inflationary pressures if wages rise unusually slowly. If downward nominal wage rigidities created a stock of pent-up wage deflation during the economic downturn, observed wage and price pressures associated with a given amount of slack or pace of reduction in slack might be unusually low for a time. If so, the first clear signs of inflation pressure could come later than usual in the progression toward maximum employment. As a result, maintaining a high degree of monetary policy accommodation until inflation pressures emerge could, in this case, unduly delay the removal of accommodation, necessitating an abrupt and potentially disruptive tightening of policy later on. That\u2019s the hawkish view. But Yellen immediately sounds dovish, explaining why the Fed could blunder by putting too much emphasis on inflation Conversely, profound dislocations in the labor market in recent years--such as depressed participation associated with worker discouragement and a still-substantial level of long-term unemployment--may cause inflation pressures to arise earlier than usual as the degree of slack in the labor market declines. However, some of the resulting wage and price pressures could subsequently ease as higher real wages draw workers back into the labor force and lower long-term unemployment. As a consequence, tightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward 2 percent might, in this case, prevent labor markets from recovering fully and so would not be consistent with the dual mandate. Reminder: the speech is online here. Janet Yellen began her speech with an upbeat statement, that over the last five years the US economy has made \u201cconsiderable progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of employment in the United States since the Great Depression:\u201d. Th unemployment rate, for example, has dropped by 4 percentage points since 2009 to just 6.2% (almost half the level in the struggling eurozone). But there was swiftly a caveat: It speaks to the depth of the damage that, five years after the end of the recession, the labor market has yet to fully recover. Janet Yellen tells economists at Jackson Hole that more \u201cnuance\u201d is needed: \u201cAssessments of the degree of remaining slack in the labor market need to become more nuanced because of considerable uncertainty about the level of employment consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate [of price stability and full employment]\u201d Breaking: Janet Yellen has said there is no \u201csimple recipe\u201d to devise the right monetary policy to tackle America\u2019s labour market. She also warned that the Fed faces difficult judgements when deciding when the US jobs market is strong enough to cope with an interest rate rise. Highlights from her speech are fizzling over the newswires: 15:00 - FED\u2019S YELLEN SAYS \u201cNO SIMPLE RECIPE\u201d FOR APPROPRIATE POLICY IN CURRENT U.S. LABOR MARKET CONTEXT 15:00 - YELLEN: STILL UNCLEAR DEGREE OF REMAINING LABOR SLACK, HOW QUICKLY IT WILL DISAPPEAR 15:00 - YELLEN: TIGHTENING POLICY TOO SOON AS INFLATION MOVES TOWARD 2 PERCENT MIGHT PREVENT LABOR MARKET FROM FULLY RECOVERING 15:00 - YELLEN SAYS FED EMPHASIS SHIFTING TO DETERMINING WHAT LABOR CONDITIONS WOULD BRING ABOUT LESS ACCOMMODATION 15:00 - YELLEN: FED NEEDS TO MAKE \u201cDIFFICULT JUDGMENTS\u201d ABOUT CYCLICAL, STRUCTURAL INFLUENCES ON LABOR MARKET 15:00 - YELLEN URGES CAUTION IN JUDGING THAT RECENT WAGE DATA POINTS TO WEAKER LABOR CONDITIONS THAN INDICATED BY UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 15:00 - YELLEN: COULD REASONABLY EXPECT FURTHER INCREASES IN LABOR DEMAND TO PULL SIZABLE SHARE OF DISCOURAGED WORKERS BACK INTO WORK FORCE More to follow... Nearly time for Janet Yellen\u2019s opening speech in Jackson Hole. Deutsche Bank economist Jim Reid reckons the Fed chair will focus on the question of how much slack remains in the US labour market. Business Insider has the details: So what can we expect from Yellen? Our US economists expect the Fed Chair to provide us with an updated assessment on the infamous \u2018Yellen dashboard\u2019 in evaluating the ongoing labour market slack and how they have yet to normalise relative to 2002-2007 levels. Some of these alternative measures she monitors include duration of unemployment, quit rate in JOLTS data, labour force participation etc. Any sound bite that touches on the debate of cyclical versus structural drivers of labour force participation will also be closely followed. Unlike some of the previous Jackson Hole symposiums, this is likely not one that will serve as a precursor of any monetary policy changes but the tone of Yellen\u2019s speech may still have a market impact and set the mood for busier times ahead in September. Given markets are seemingly expecting nothing but another dovish display from Yellen the risk is perhaps skewed to the other side. Shares have dipped on Wall Street at the start of trading, as investors await Janet Yellen\u2019s speech. The Dow Jones index is 0.16% lower, dropping 26 points to 17,011. And the S&amp;P 100 dipped a little from yesterday\u2019s record closing high. US government bonds are trading flat, Reuters points out: U.S. 10-YR TREASURY PRICE UNCHANGED, YIELD AT 2.40 PCT AHEAD OF FED CHAIR JANET YELLEN\u2019S JACKSON HOLE SPEECH DUE AT 10:00 A.M. EDT (1400 GMT) In London, the FTSE is down just 10 points. Germany\u2019s DAX is down 0.4%, and France\u2019s CAC is down 0.75%, as Russia\u2019s decision to sent its aid convoy into Ukraine without permission weighs on Europe\u2019s markets. James Bullard is a busy bee. He\u2019s now told Reuters that the European Central bank needs to agree new stimulus measures to help the eurozone economy recover. The president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank chipped in, just hours before Mario Draghi addresses the Jackson Hole symposium, warning: \u201cIf Europe as a whole goes into recession, that would be a serious issue from the perspective of US monetary policy.\u201d Bullard cited Europe\u2019s low inflation rate , which has sagged to just 0.4%: \u201cTo me, that\u2019s a flashing signal to the ECB that they need to take actions that are sufficient to reassure markets that they\u2019re going to hit their targets over the near term.\u201d Bloomberg have kindly sent found the transcript of their interview with James Bullard, of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. As flagged earlier, Bullard predicted that the US Fed will raise rates just seven months time, in March 2015: The evidence is leading toward an earlier increase that would have been in the works earlier this year. Labor markets have improved quite a bit relative to what the committee was thinking.\u201d There was also an interesting exchange with Bloomberg\u2019s Kathleen Hays, who pointed to Europe\u2019s weaknesses, and the geopolitical tensions over Ukraine. HAYS: Well, more \u2013 it seems \u2013 more and more numbers, you know, the economic numbers on your part are not getting better. They seem to be getting worse. More bad numbers out of Germany. And one of the guests on my show recently, and how could the Fed move now? How could the Fed signal? Even signal a move to raise the rate at a time when you\u2019ve got the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the sanctions, and Europe getting weaker. This wouldn\u2019t be prudent. Of course, the Fed wouldn\u2019t make a move at a time like this. BULLARD: Well, I don\u2019t know what your guest was thinking, but let me just paint the picture the opposite way. U.S. is growing at three percent, unemployment has dropped a point over the last year. Job growth is a real bust, and they are a long away from normal. They should get going on normalization, and then for Europe, you know, they might look to additional stimulus, although, you know, and I have advocated QE for Europe, and then it seems like you get the exchange rate movements in the direct \u2013 at least, pressure will go in the direction that you want, given that situation, a slowing Europe and a growing U.S. A handy reminder for Jackson Hole attendees of how the US economy has improved since last year\u2019s meeting: I predict a scramble: A flurry of comments from Federal Reserve policymakers have just hit the wires, setting the scene for Jackson Hole. It includes regular hawk James Bullard, who says US interest rates will rise in the first quarter of next year. That\u2019s earlier than other Fed officials have suggested (Bullard himself won\u2019t have a vote on the FOMC until 2016, though) This year\u2019s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium kicks off in a couple of hours (3pm BST), bringing together top central bankers from across the globe. This year\u2019s event is titled \u201cRe-Evaluating Labor Market Dynamics\u201d -- a crucial issue right now, with the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England trying to assess how much employment slack remains in their respective spheres. But while Fed and the BoE are both inching towards normalising monetary policy, the other two big central banks \u2013 the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan \u2013 could both expand their stimulus measures in the future. That\u2019s why Mario Draghi\u2019s speech late tonight (7.30pm BST) could be particularly interesting -- will be respond to the latest weak economic data, showing the eurozone stagnating? Economist Shaun Richards comments: The Euro area looks as though it may already be turning down again after not much of a recovery as France and Italy in particular struggle. So a meeting at which one might expect an unwinding of central bank activity may in fact have premonitions of further expansion in Europe. Is this our future where several of the main central banks are always expanding policy? Janet Yellen\u2019s opening address (3pm BST) will also be closely watched for any signals regarding future interest rate rises. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale reckons she is likely to sound rather cautious today; a contrast with the latest minutes from the Fed\u2019s monetary policy committee: After the hawkish bias to FOMC minutes, the dovish camp gets its chance to sound off at Jackson Hole. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services agrees: The whisper on the Street would have us believe that Ms Yellen will take a more forcefully dovish line in today\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole, despite rather \u201cless dovish\u201d tones to the July FOMC minutes, and one can assume that there will be rather too much verbiage devoted by the financial community to \u2018analysing\u2019 the nuances of the speech, and the implications for the policy outlook, above all the timing of \u201cnormalization lift-off\u201d. Whereby the term normalization would be better described as a step into the unknown, given that the whole process of financial intermediation has changed so drastically, and there is no precedent for exiting from such a protracted, and policy induced, period of capital misallocation. There\u2019s also one big change this year -- Wall Street economists aren\u2019t welcome. Janet Yellen has tightened the invite list; perhaps keen to ditch the idea that Jackson Hole gave financial players valuable insight into central bank thinking. Instead, there are guests such as William Spriggs, chief economist of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella organisation for the US union movement, the FT flags up. Russia\u2019s economy ministry has reported that its economy kept shrinking last month GDP fell by 0.2% year-on-year during July, following a 0.1% contraction in June, suggesting that the Ukraine crisis down its already weak economy. Russian workers have been reporting signs of falling demand, and weak wage growth, this summer. There are fears Russia could fall into recession if geopolitical tensions don\u2019t ease. So far this year, GDP has risen by 0.7%, the ministry reported. On the other hand, there are also more conciliatory quotes from Ukraine on the wires: Shares in Moscow are falling further, as Ukraine expresses its anger over Russia sending its aid convoy across the border without an agreement: Other European markets have been inching down through the morning. The French CAC has lost 0.7% so far, and Germany\u2019s DAX is down nearly 0.5%. Shares fell on the news that Russia\u2019s aid convoy has crossed the Ukraine border this morning, while battles rage between Kiev\u2019s forces and Moscow-backed rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk. Russian aid convoy clears customs at east Ukraine border Russia insists the mission is simply to provide help, but some Ukrainian politicians fear darker motives. The convoy had been paused at the border while both sides argued about how the trucks would be inspected and monitored. Russia appears to have decided to sent the trucks on regardless. The FT reports: It is impossible to put up with this mayhem, blatant lies and this unwillingness to agree any longer,\u201d the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement on its website on Friday. With a long weekend looming, it appears that many in the City have already clocked off -- or keeping their heads down until Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium at 3pm UK time. The FTSE 100 remains flat (down just 7 points). Will Hedden of IG reports that some market-watchers are \u201cdesperately counting the days until September and a little more action\u201d The market expects a dovish offering from Fed chair Janet Yellen when she speaks early in the US trading day. And Mario Draghi\u2019s speech (7.30pm BST) could provide a spark: It might be time to start explaining the what in \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 if the slide in European data is to be halted. All looks quiet in Brussels too: The world\u2019s top central bankers can\u2019t avoid seeing the public\u2019s anger over the state of the global economy, even though they\u2019ve schlepped out to rural Wyoming. Protesters gathered at Jackson Hole, venue for the annual economic policy symposium. Their message is that many millions of ordinary people around the globe haven\u2019t yet felt the benefits of the \u201crecovery\u201d since the financial crisis. Here\u2019s a few photos from yesterday: Co-op Bank CEO Niall Booker also admitted that the exodus of customer accounts, down almost 30,000 so far this year, was very painful. The loss of any customer is a \u201cmortal wound\u201d (not literally, we trust) to an experienced banker like himself. However, it could have ben even worse.... Booker says: \u201cConsidering the amount of time that we spent receiving negative publicity in the cusp of the first and second quarters, I think the reduction is not significant and probably less than we would have expected.\u201d Some customers may have quit the Co-op after it raised the fees on certain accounts, such as its Privilege Premium service. Co-op Bank\u2019s chief executive has warned that the company plans to keep cutting jobs, on top of the 1,560 workers \u2018let go\u2019 in the last year. Speaking after announcing a \u00a375m loss this morning (details here), Niall Booker warned that \u201cone or two more redundancy programmes\u201d may be needed. Booker told reporters that: \u201cA large proportion of our cost is in people and, consequently, we will continue to see job reductions. There have been one or two redundancy programmes and I believe there will be one or two more in that respect\u201d Booker also warned that Co-op Bank doesn\u2019t expect to return to profit this year, or in 2015. Over one hundred of Britain\u2019s business leaders are planning to wade into the Scottish independence vote by urging Scots to preserve the union. That\u2019s according to the Daily Telegraph today, which reckons the joint letter could be a \u201ca hammerblow\u201d for SNP leader Alex Salmond. Scottish business leaders prepare to unite against independence Louise Armitstead, the Telegraph\u2019s chief business correspondent, reports that the business people involved all have operations north of the border : Keith Cochrane, chief executive of the Glasgow-based engineer Weir Group, is behind the move and has spent weeks persuading chairmen, chief executives and entrepreneurs to sign a joint letter urging voters to reject independence for the sake of economic prosperity. Planned as the most comprehensive and powerful statement from the Scottish business community to date, the business list is expected to include bosses from publicly listed companies and retailers, as well as financial services leaders and an army of small and medium-sized business leaders. Those approached include City heavyweights such as Donald Brydon, the chairman of Royal Mail; Bill Gammell, the former Scottish rugby player and boss of Cairn Energy; Angus Cockburn, interim chief executive of the power company Aggreko; and Ben van Beurden, chief executive of the oil giant Shell. However, the bulk of the list is deliberately made up of small and medium-sized business managers and entrepreneurs. News of the letter emerges as HSBC chairman Douglas Flint warns that Scotland could suffer a \u201ccapital flight\u201d if it breaks away from the rest of the UK Flint cited uncertainty over what currency it would use, and on what terms, warning: \u201cthe transition from the existing currency union would be complex and fraught with danger\u201d. Stan Shamu of IG says investors expect Janet Yellen to remain \u201cfairly dovish\u201d in her speech later today, \u201cfocusing on measures of labour market slack that support continued policy accommodation\u201d. There\u2019s a nervous feel in the financial markets as many of the world\u2019s top central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for their annual meeting. Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, will give a speech at 3pm BST which might give new insights into her view of the global economy, and the prospects of a US rate rise. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is also giving a speech, but not until 7.30pm BST. That has left investors reluctant to do anything too decisive. Europe\u2019s stock markets are barely shifting in early trading, with the FTSE 100 up just half a point, or +0.01%.... EDF insists that it did its best to avoid customer disruption over its IT migration, and took on \u201chundreds of extra staff were recruited to restore service levels\u201d once things went wrong. But it accepts that it did fail some customers. The \u00a33m package announced today won\u2019t go directly to those people, though, as Beatrice Bigois, EDF Energy\u2019s Managing Director of Customers, explains: \u201cDespite our best efforts and extensive planning to manage this transition in 2011 without impacting our customers, we recognise that for a period of time the service to our customers was not up to the standards they deserve. We apologise to those customers who were impacted during this period. \u201cWe have cooperated fully with Ofgem and have taken this matter very seriously. The \u00a33m package that we are offering will ensure that thousands of vulnerable customers are provided with free, independent advice on debt, as well as information to help them manage their energy consumption and bills.\u201d Britain\u2019s EDF Energy is to hand over \u00a33m to groups representing \u2018vulnerable customers\u2019 after failing to handle complaints properly. An investigation by the industry watchdog, Ofgem, found the company had breached complaint handling rules during a mass migration to a IT system three years ago. Complaints surged by 30%, as glitches during the migration left EDF unable to receive, record and process some complaints for over six months, from May 2011 to January 2012. In an sobering report this morning, Ofgem said many customers simply hung up because waiting times were too long. For those who persevered, EDF was often unable to properly record the details of their problems Sarah Harrison, Ofgem\u2019s senior partner with responsibility for enforcement, said companies need to do better when handing such migrations: \u201cEDFEnergy failed to have sufficiently robust processes in place when they introduced a new IT system and this led to the unacceptable handling of complaints. \u201cTheir commitment to putting things right and paying \u00a33 million to the Citizens Advice Energy Best Deal Extra scheme and the Plymouth Citizen Advice Bureau\u2019s Debt Helpline to benefit vulnerable customers is a step in the right direction to rebuilding consumer trust.\u201d EDF has already admitted that its customers suffered significant disruption during the IT changeover, and publicly apologised. Those Co-op Bank customers who have stuck with the company despite its recent turmoil may have seen their local branch close. Today\u2019s results (the first since it posted a \u00a31.3bn in 2013) show that it has cut its payroll by 21 percent in the past year to 5,860 and closed 46 branches, reducing its branch network by 16 percent since the start of the year. Another 25 branches will close in the fourth quarter, it said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. The first big news of the morning is that Britain\u2019s bruised Co-operative Bank has reported a \u00a375m loss for the first half of 2014. It also revealed that more than 20,000 customers have left amid its recent troubles. Today\u2019s loss is an improvement on the \u00a3845m loss recorded a year ago -- impairment charges and operating costs have both improved. Co-op Bank was dragged into crisis last year as a \u00a31.5bn black hole opened up in its balance sheet, forcing the Co-operative Group to relinquish control to a group of hedge funds. Today\u2019s figures show the bank has cut 13% of its staff so far this year, and the bank has also lost customers -- with a net loss of 28,199 current accounts this year. Chief executive Niall Booker insists that the company is on the road to recovery, but still has a way to go: \u201cBy the measures of capital and liquidity the bank is considerably stronger than it was a year ago,\u201d \u201dWe are ahead of schedule in the disposal of non-core assets and have improved governance, particularly at board level. However, the issues we continue to face in building a sustainable business are deep rooted and there remains much to be done.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of former Comet employees are to lose out on compensation for being laid off incorrectly after an employment tribunal ruling on Friday dashed hopes of a payout. A Leeds tribunal ruled in June that a number of former Comet employees laid off when the retailer went bust should receive 90 days' pay in compensation. The tribunal judge found that the company and its administrator Deloitte did not organise proper consultations when 7,000 people were made redundant in 2012. The government, which must pick up the tab, has said the bill could reach a maximum of \u00a326m. However, it is now clear the bill will be considerably less. Friday's ruling stated that the large number of former Comet staff who have not already filed a claim for compensation will lose out. The tribunal judge decided that claims for compensation made by representatives acting for other workers or by individuals will be valid but those who have yet to lodge a claim, or have one lodged on their behalf, will miss out. About 4,000 workers did not stake a claim within the time limit. Some of those will be paid because a representative put in a claim for them, but hundreds of staff could lose out. However, Victoria Robertson, a lawyer at Needle Partnership who acted for sacked staff at the tribunal, said the ruling was good news because hundreds of workers who had not made a claim themselves could receive up to \u00a33,600 in compensation from the government if their manager, union representative or another representative had put in a claim. \"This is a good result and a sensible outcome,\" she said. The Comet case is the subject of a government inquiry which has already referred three of Deloitte's most experienced administrators to their professional body in relation to their activities at Comet. It has also emerged that UK taxpayers have been hit with a bill of as much as \u00a350m in compensatory payments to workers laid off incorrectly during more than 20 company insolvencies overseen by Deloitte in the past six years. Deloitte has said that Comet made \"significant efforts\" to consult with staff ahead of the redundancies. A spokesman for Deloitte said: \"We estimate the maximum possible award that could result from the Comet case to be less than half the \u00a326m figure that has been quoted by the secretary of state, and we have provided relevant information to the Insolvency Service to assist them with paying the award. \"There was extensive consultation with the Comet employees at more than 250 establishments during the administration, whilst we kept the business going and looked for a purchaser to rescue it.\" The incident has led to call for a change in the law by unions, who say workers need more protection, and the insolvency trade body R3, which says in some cases there was little or no money available to pay for the full redundancy consultation required by law. However, employers are not to be held to the full requirements for consultation in special circumstances which render it not reasonably practicable for the employer to comply. Meanwhile, the fate of thousands of workers who were employed in smaller stores must await the outcome of ongoing legal action in Europe. At present, UK law limits government redundancy payments when a company has gone bust to those working in \"establishments\" \u2013 taken to mean individual shops or warehouses \u2013 where more than 20 people work. An employment appeal tribunal in Britain has already ruled the \"fewer than 20 workers\" condition should relate to a business as a whole, not individual sites. But the government has appealed and the case is now headed to the European court of justice in Luxembourg.",

      "bodyText": "Apple caught eye of investors last week, hitting a record high and helping lift America's S&amp;P 500 to a new peak. The company has nearly doubled in value since a low of $55 in April last year, adding some $300bn to its market value as investors bet on the success of its new products - including the forthcoming iPhone 6 and its rumoured iWatch. The company was also helped by positive comments from activist investor Carl Icahn, who bought Apple stock last autumn, and on Friday its shares reached the dizzy heights of $101.24 despite worries about supply problems for the new iPhone. Overall, despite a rather downbeat performance on Friday, global markets spent the week shrugging off continuing tensions between Russia and Ukraine and worries about a rise in interest rates. As well as the S&amp;P hitting a high of 1994, the FTSE 100 finished the week 86 points higher at 6775.25 despite slipping 2.41 points on Friday. Volumes were fairly light as the summer lull continued, especially as the UK bank holiday approached. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets warned: It is hard to escape the conclusion that despite another record high for the S&amp;P500 the rally feels forced, as the psychologically important 2,000 level acts like a flame attracting a moth. The concern is that while this particular US market continues to push higher, its sibling markets remain short of their previous record highs. And with a Russian convoy entering Ukraine and ratcheting up the dispute between the two countries, as well as continuing violence in Gaza and Syria, investors remained wary of the geopolitical outlook. Traders also spent the week contemplating a rise in interest rates, with two Bank of England members unexpectedly voting for an increase in UK borrowing costs at this month's meeting. The US Federal Reserve's latest minutes also seemed to suggest an earlier than expected rise may be on the cards, and Fed chair Janet Yellen's speech at the Jackson Hole central bank meeting did not dispel that idea. The week's US data - including a sharp drop in jobless claims and existing home sales at a 10 month high - also pointed to a recovering economy and therefore less need for central bank stimulus measures. There was also a spate of takeover speculation. Vodafone rose 3.25p to 205.85p on talk of renewed interest from US rival AT&amp;T, while AstraZeneca added 6.5p to \u00a344.18. Next week rejected suitor Pfizer could return with a new offer if AstraZeneca's board agrees, although analysts were sceptical of the idea. Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon said: The prospects of renewed hostilities next week are remote, but AstraZeneca remains an attractive bid candidate which may attract interest after 26 November [when Pfizer could return without AstraZeneca's recommendation]. Struggling supermarket Tesco had come under pressure on talk that new chief executive Dave Lewis should cut its dividend, but hopes of an improvement in its market share performance in the latest Kantar Worldpanel figures next week helped limit the damage, and it climbed 2.5p to 248p. BHP Billiton, down 27p at \u00a319.44, unveiled a long rumoured demerger during the week but disappointed the market with worse than expected profits and the lack of a cash return to shareholders. The prospect of an interest rate rise was likely to hit high street retailers, according to analysts at Barclays, who turned negative on the sector. They said: Tightening monetary policy in the UK will likely pressure the finances of UK households, forcing a reconsideration of spending habits after five years of near-zero interest rates. Historically, in an environment of interest rate increases the general retail stocks have underperformed. Halfords lost 7.2p to 488.5p as Barclays cut its recommendation from equal weight to underweight and its target price from 460p to 400p. Finally, the London Stock Exchange added 24p to \u00a320.29 despite launching a \u00a3938m cash call at a deeply discounted \u00a312.95 a share to help fund its $2.7bn purchase of US group Frank Russell. The exchange also reported a 26% rise in first quarter profit to \u00a3129.8m.",

Yellen\u2019s first speech at the annual meeting of global central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, focused largely on the jobs market. \u201cThe economy has made considerable progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of employment in the United States since the Great Depression,\u201d she said. \u201cThese developments are encouraging, but it speaks to the depth of the damage that, five years after the end of the recession, the labour market has yet to fully recover.\u201d The US has added more than 200,000 jobs each month for six months in a row. Yellen said that despite the improvements the Fed was awaiting more evidence about the health of labour markets before deciding when to start raising interest rates. The US central bank has kept rates close to zero since December 2008 when the US entered a recession following the bursting of the housing bubble. It has also poured billions each month into the US economy through a series of bond buying programmes known as quantitative easing (QE). QE is due to end later this year, but Yellen gave no clear indication about when, or if, rates would rise. Yellen, an expert in labour markets, used the speech, seen as one of the most important in the Fed\u2019s calendar, to outline her views on the state of the jobs\u2019 market. She said there was a \u201cconsiderable body of research\u201d that the recession had changed the jobs market. \u201cAlong with cyclical influences, significant structural factors have affected the labour market, including the ageing of the workforce and other demographic trends, possible changes in the underlying degree of dynamism in the labor market, and the phenomenon of \u2018polarization\u2019 \u2013 that is, the reduction in the relative number of middle-skill jobs,\u201d she said. As the recovery has progressed Yellen said that the Fed\u2019s review of the labour market has needed to \u201cbecome more nuanced\u201d. She said the Fed\u2019s policy committee\u2019s decisions \u201cwill not be based on any single indicator, but will instead take into account a wide range of information on the labour market, as well as inflation and financial developments\u201d. In a note to clients Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at broker BTIG, wrote: \u201cToday\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen is more or less what should have been expected. She maintains the view that more work lay ahead but presents a set of \u2018on the other hand\u2019 explanations for number of indicators and observations. For example, the word \u2018however\u2019 appears eight times in the speech and any number of \u2018converselys\u2019 make an appearance. At seemingly every turn, when articulating the view that a given indicator suggests labor market weakness or slack, she balances the observation with an alternative argument. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing necessarily new in today\u2019s speech (as expected) but if we had to make a singular statement, the speech suggests those calling for an earlier rate hike did not today receive additional support.\u201d US stock markets dipped marginally following the speech with the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining 0.13%.",

Judging by the latest inflation figures, it is a game consumers are winning hands down \u2013 especially when it comes to clothing and footwear.

Shoppers kept their purses and wallets closed in anticipation that retailers would take a look at racks full of unsold summer fashions and hit the panic button.

      "bodyText": "EDF Energy has become the latest of the big six energy suppliers to feel the heat of the energy regulator by paying out \u00a33m to vulnerable customers after breaching complaints handling rules. The French state-owned group has been punished 24 hours after the Labour party unveiled plans to revoke the licences of energy suppliers that repeatedly act against the interests of consumers. Ofgem, the industry watchdog, has been investigating EDF after a 30% increase in complaints following the introduction of a new IT system. \"EDF Energy failed to have sufficiently robust processes in place when they introduced a new IT system and this led to the unacceptable handling of complaints,\" said Sarah Harrison, senior partner for enforcement at Ofgem. The \u00a33m will go to a Citizens Advice energy scheme and a debt helpline. The energy supply company, which is also behind plans to build Britain's first nuclear power plant in 20 years, admitted it had let down customers with sub-standard service. \"We have cooperated fully with Ofgem and have taken this matter very seriously. The \u00a33m package that we are offering will ensure that thousands of vulnerable customers are provided with free, independent advice on debt, as well as information to help them manage their energy consumption and bills,\" said Beatrice Bigois, managing director for customers at EDF Energy. Matt Ridout of independent price comparison site energyhelpline.com said Ofgem's action showed there was \"nowhere to hide\" for suppliers that were not providing appropriate service to customers. \"Poor complaints handling procedures, unacceptable call waiting times and technical difficulties due to IT failures are simply not good enough in this day and age, regardless of the excuse given,\" he said. There has been a growing pile of fines or similar payouts ordered over the last 18 months, including from British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power. A wider collapse of customers' trust and soaring energy costs has led to an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), taking place over the next 18 months. It will increase the pressure on the big six suppliers \u2013 British Gas, SSE, E.ON, EDF, npower and Scottish Power. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, has backed the CMA inquiry and fought to bring down energy prices. On Thursday, his Labour shadow, Caroline Flint, unveiled plans for a new regulator with the power to revoke licences and introduce an annual scorecard to monitor company behaviour. Labour has also promised that if it wins power next spring it will freeze energy prices to \"reset\" the market. This plan has been blamed by Paul Massara, the chief executive of SSE, for his company's failure to reduce household bills despite a 50% fall in wholesale gas prices since the start of the year. Massara said SSE would be unable to raise them again in response to increased costs if Ed Miliband won the general election. \"The potential Labour price freeze has, of course, also complicated all pricing decisions further,\" he said in a note attached to a formal submission to the CMA inquiry.
