      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank is under growing pressure to step up support for the eurozone\u2019s flagging economy after the bloc slipped back into negative inflation in February. The surprise drop in prices marked the third time in a year that inflation has turned negative, fanning fears that the eurozone is headed for all-out deflation \u2013 a sustained period of falling prices. The news cemented market expectations that the ECB would use its meeting next week to inject fresh cash into the single currency bloc and to cut a key interest rate further into negative territory. Headline inflation dropped to -0.2% in February, down from 0.3% in January, according to an early estimate from statistics office Eurostat. That contrasted with forecasts for a reading of zero in a Reuters poll of economists. Low energy prices were the main factor behind the drop, but price pressures in other areas of the economy played a part. There was also a drop in core inflation \u2013 taken as a guide to underlying price \u2013 adding to signs that low inflation was becoming more entrenched as eurozone economies battled with sluggish global demand from a fresh slowdown and the lingering impact of the last financial crisis. Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile prices of unprocessed food and energy, fell more than expected to 0.8% from 1% in January and was its lowest since April last year. Economists said the inflation numbers raised questions over the firepower of central banks to revive growth and prices. Deflation concerns central bank policymakers because it can lead to consumers delaying spending in the anticipation of good becoming cheaper, creating a cycle of diminishing demand that hits economic growth. This year will be the fourth year of inflation undershooting the ECB\u2019s target of close to 2%, said Anatoli Annenkov, economist at French banking group Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. There were no limits to the ECB\u2019s willingness \u201cbut clear limits to its effectiveness\u201d, he said. \u201cDespite its best efforts, the ECB\u2019s challenge to break the backbone of lowflation remains a tall order. Looking set to miss its target for a fourth year this year, we expect it to miss it for another four years, at least, without the help of more substantial economic reform. That won\u2019t stop the ECB from doing what it must according to its self-imposed target, but with markets increasingly unconvinced, we are approaching the \u2018effective\u2019 limit of the ECB\u2019s tools.\u201d The inflation figures follow warnings from the IMF and the OECD that governments cannot rely on low interest rates and money-printing programmes to shore up growth. A weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the G20 group of countries ended with a similar statement that \u201cmonetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth\u201d. But the policymakers failed to come up with a concrete plan of how they might revive a sluggish world economy. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, used his speech at the Shanghai meeting to insist central bankers still had ammunition left to boost growth. But he too argued for more help from governments. This week marks seven years of UK interest rates at a record low of 0.5% and Carney has hinted that he is prepared to cut the base rate further but has ruled out following the trend seen in other countries for negative rates, where depositors are effectively charged for parking their money. The Bank of Japan recently joined the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in cutting rates to below zero to rescue their economies from deflation and the prospect of recession. The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December, amid signs of a strongly growing US economy. But a string of poor economic figures since then raised doubts about any future rate-rises and even prompted some economists to speculate the move could be reversed. The ECB meets again next week to decide its next move and its chief, Mario Draghi, has already indicated the central bank will announce moves to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone. Economists expect the Frankfurt-based body to expand its quantitative easing programme \u2013 where it pumps money into the economy by buying up assets from financial institutions \u2013 and to further cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.4%. Another reduction in the deposit rate means it would be charging banks more to hold their money overnight. The weak core inflation figure \u201cpretty much seals the deal on additional monetary easing\u201d at next week\u2019s meeting, said Teunis Brosens at ING bank. \u201cThe weakening of core inflation shows the real and present danger that cheap oil will cause low inflation to become ingrained in eurozone price and wage dynamics. This is especially bad for debt-laden households, businesses and governments in Southern Europe, which will have little scope to \u2018inflate away\u2019 their debt burden by increasing nominal wages,\u201d Brosens said.",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons\u2019 shares up 6%; Ocado\u2019s down 8%. It\u2019s hard to argue with the market\u2019s snap judgment on Monday\u2019s strategic shuffles in the online grocery market. On the principle that it\u2019s better to be cuddly with the Amazonian monster than to stand in its path, the chief executive of Morrisons, David Potts, is being pragmatic in signing a deal to supply hundreds of fresh, frozen and ambient products to the US online retailer. Morrisons is also the one major supermarket chain that produces a lot of its own food, by owning farms and manufacturing facilities. Arguably, that alters the economics of a tie-up with Amazon. Morrisons can still hope to make a profit as a manufacturer and wholesaler on its Amazon lines, even if it is surrendering the retailer\u2019s profit margin. What\u2019s more, Potts also breaks Morrisons\u2019 previous reliance on Ocado\u2019s services in the online market. He now has two partners. Trying to sound cheerful about this development, Ocado\u2019s chief executive, Tim Steiner, describes his own potential extended distribution deal with Morrisons as a \u201cwin-win arrangement\u201d. Perhaps it will be but it hasn\u2019t been signed yet and Morrisons says it will proceed only if it brings \u201cprofitable online growth\u201d. That may be code for Potts demanding better terms than his predecessor signed in the original Morrisons-Ocado partnership. If it happens, the latest deal will differ from the first in two important ways. First, Morrisons won\u2019t be putting up capital to buy half the Erith warehouse in south-east London, as it did at Dordon in Warwickshire. Second, for Morrisons deliveries in Scotland, Cornwall and parts of the north of England, a \u201cstore pick\u201d model will be used, which runs counter to Ocado\u2019s philosophy that centralised distribution is always best. Maybe such compromises are just the price of getting things done, but it\u2019s yet another thing for Ocado\u2019s shareholders to worry about. They were promised a deal with an international retailer by the end of last year. That hasn\u2019t happened yet, and instead there\u2019s a different type of deal with an established customer that is cosying up to Amazon. Suddenly, the landscape looks complicated in Ocado-land. Waitrose seems to be an unreliable boyfriend for the long-term; now Morrisons is being cute with Amazon. As for the idea of Amazon buying Ocado, that now seems a non-starter. For the rest of the supermarket sector, the question is whether Amazon is finally getting serious about groceries in the UK. The addition of \u201chundreds\u201d \u2013 but not thousands \u2013 of Morrisons lines is an upgrade but not a game-changer. Amazon is still behaving like a souped-up convenience store, but the full-line offer is surely coming. GSK chairman\u2019s big decisions Sir Philip Hampton, the new-ish chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, has two big items to deal with this year. One is to find a new chief executive since it is clear that Sir Andrew Witty, boss since 2008, is entering his last lap. The second is to respond to the persistent calls for GSK to be broken up. The best approach? Don\u2019t confuse the two issues. Advocates of a breakup are doing the opposite, naturally. Expect to hear a lot from the splitters about what Witty\u2019s successor \u201cmust\u201d do to address the underperformance of the share price over the past couple of years. In reality, the argument for a breakup is wafer-thin \u2013 and probably still will be after Witty\u2019s expected exit next year. The consumer products division is the obvious candidate for separation but the timing looks wrong. GSK and Novartis pooled their consumer assets only last year and set out ambitions to double the division\u2019s profit margins by 2020. That plan needs time to work. As for the vaccines operation, what would be the point of independence? It shares its sales and distribution network with the core pharmaceutical business and smooths out the bumps in earnings. Splitting off ViiV, the majority-owned HIV operation, is more plausible but when Witty toyed with the idea a couple of years ago shareholders told him not to sell. Hampton should keep it simple: find the best person for the job, which is surely someone with more to offer than an overly simplistic breakup agenda. RBS chief\u2019s show of confidence The chancellor can\u2019t sell our Royal Bank of Scotland shares at the current shrivelled price, but management can buy a few. Its chief executive, Ross McEwan, and finance director, Ewen Stevenson, have bought \u00a3445,000-worth apiece. That\u2019s a decent slug of stock. Mind you, given what the duo earned in a lousy year for the bank, it would be rude \u2013 and a little worrying \u2013 if they didn\u2019t show confidence in RBS at just 0.7 times book value.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in the former BP boss Tony Hayward\u2019s Kurdistan-focused oil company Genel Energy have plunged more than 40% after it slashed the estimated value of its largest oilfield by $1bn (\u00a3720m). Genel said it had revised down reserves held within Taq Taq to 356m barrels from a 683m-barrel figure given in 2011. Half of the impairment on the value of Taq Taq was down to the reserve revision and half due to the stubbornly low oil price, it said. North Sea Brent crude is about $36 a barrel compared with $115 in the summer of 2014 and many predict it will remain below $70 until 2018. The downward revision on Taq Taq is likely to overshadow the company\u2019s annual profit figures, to be released on Thursday. The admission sent Genel\u2019s shares into a tailspin, knocking \u00a3141m off its stock market value. It will be a blow for its largest individual investor, Nat Rothschild, scion of the banking dynasty of the same name. His 8% stake was worth \u00a328m at the beginning of the day but just \u00a316.5m by the close of trading. The slump marks a huge reversal of fortunes for Genel since it floated in 2011. Shares were sold for \u00a310 in the initial public offering, while a bonus scheme that has since lapsed was designed to pay out if the shares hit \u00a312.50. It has been held back by inconsistent payments from the Kurdistan regional government and the rock-bottom oil price. The fresh falls saw the stock close the day at 74p, less than one-tenth of the float price. Hayward, Genel\u2019s chairman, who left BP in 2010 after the controversial response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, said the revision was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. But he insisted that \u201cwhile it\u2019s a major setback, it is by no means the end of Genel\u201d. He pointed to the company\u2019s very low cost of production, a major strength given the low oil price. Genel also expects to benefit from its Miran and Bina Bawi fields, from which it expects to supply about 20% of Turkey\u2019s gas. The key reason for the reduced estimate of the Taq Taq field, in which Genel holds a 44% stake, was a reassessment of how porous the upper part of the field is. Greater porosity makes it easier to extract oil trapped in rocks below the surface. The company also holds a 25% stake in the 675m-barrel Tawke field. It took the decision to revise its estimate of Taq Taq\u2019s size after a review in conjunction with the consultants McDaniel &amp; Associates. It said the move had been spurred by evidence of declining production at the field during 2015. The company left its production guidance for 2016 unchanged at up to 70,000 barrels per day. While the plunging share price could prove an opportunity for a potential buyer, one source said Genel was still interested in growing by acquisition. They said the company had plenty of cash on the balance sheet and would not need a rights issue, despite the Taq Taq downgrade.",

    "webTitle": "UK consumes far less than a decade ago \u2013 'peak stuff' or something else?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The amount of \u201cstuff\u201d used in the UK \u2013 including food, fuel, metals and building materials \u2013 has fallen dramatically since 2001, according to official government figures. The Office for National Statistics data released on Monday reveals that on average people used 15 tonnes of material in 2001 compared with just over 10 tonnes in 2013. The figures look at the total amount of biomass (crops and livestock fodder, wood and fish), coal, oil and gas, metal and non-metallic minerals such as construction materials used in the UK every year. Some of the biggest decreases have been in metal ore consumption, in part because the amount of metal required to manufacture modern domestic goods such as fridges and washing machines is far lower than in the past. UK households have also abandoned buying many resource-intensive goods common in the recent past \u2013 such as metal-heavy video recorders and hi-fi systems, vinyl records, CDs and books \u2013 as they shift to digital consumption. In 2000, British households bought 126m CDs but this tumbled to just 54m last year, while cassettes are heading for the history books, with sales falling 99.9% since 2000. DVD chain Blockbuster, which once operated 528 stores on Britain\u2019s high streets, closed the last ones in 2013, pushed out by the rise of digital services such as Netflix. The figures will spark fresh speculation that Britain and other developed economies have hit \u2018peak stuff\u2019, although some critics question whether consumption is really going down. In January, Ikea said the appetite of western consumers for home furnishings had reached its peak and consumption of many familiar goods was at its limit. Household spending on physical goods, including furnishings, clothing, cars and gadgets, decreased between 2002/03 and 2014, said Chris Goodall, an author of books on climate change. Households now spend more on services than physical goods, he said. \u201cPart of the reason for the reduction in UK material use is the growing impact of digitisation. But we are also tending to eat less food and use less water, for example. \u201cAnd across a wide range of industries, the economy is tending to use a smaller weight of materials as a result of better efficiency and because homes and offices now have pretty much all the equipment they need,\u201d he said. Consumption of paper and cardboard began to decline in 2001, the amount of household waste produced by each person in the UK began to fall in 2003, and consumption of water began to go down from 2004, all at a time of rising population and GDP. The ONS figures suggest that consumption of raw materials per head in Britain is now among the lowest in Europe, behind only Spain. But Goodall added that countries across the globe are using less. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to see the same in China. Steel and cement \u2013 by far the most important inputs to the economy in terms of weight \u2013 have peaked. And since China represents about 50% of world steel consumption, this has a global impact.\u201d Even the total weight of biomass consumed in the UK has fallen, despite a rising population. The ONS said that in 2000 the UK chomped and burned its way through 188m tonnes of crops, fish and wood, compared with 172.5m in 2013, the last year for which figures are available. Fossil fuel consumption peaked in 2001 at 283m tonnes. In 2012 it was 249m tonnes, although this was an increase on the lows of 2008-09. But the country\u2019s environmental accounts can be interpreted in many ways. The switch to a service-based economy rather than a manufacturing one means Britain consumes far fewer materials and energy for every unit of economic output compared with economies such as Germany. The amount of materials and energy that goes into making, say, an Adele music download or a shipping insurance policy in Britain are tiny compared with making a car in Germany, so it means that for each unit of economic output Britain uses relatively fewer material resources. The ONS suggested that the link between material consumption and economic growth is \u201cdecoupling\u201d, with Britain having become more efficient at increasing output while using fewer resources. The ONS said: \u201cOver the 2000 to 2013 period, resource productivity (the relationship between economic activity and material consumption) in the UK has positively increased, rising 59.4% from \u00a31.87 per kg in 2000 to \u00a32.98 per kg in 2013, reflecting the shift away from manufacturing towards financial and other service industries.\u201d But other data show British households gorging on consumer goods. Car sales hit an unprecedented 2.63m in 2015, while Primark\u2019s UK sales have accelerated to more than \u00a35bn as shoppers load their baskets with skinny jeans and playsuits. So are the British really consuming less? One expert said the amount the UK consumed has increased since the turn of the millennium, citing his extrapolation of data from the UN environment programme. \u201cThere are indications of saturation in some markets, such as with Ikea on furnishings. You do see these micro trends of peak stuff, but the idea we\u2019re living in a peak stuff world is nuts,\u201d said Tim Jackson, professor of sustainable development at the University of Surrey. A closer analysis of the ONS figures shows a big drop in consumption of non-metallic minerals used by the construction industry, such as sand, gravel, limestone and gypsum. This collapsed from 321m tonnes in 2000 to 212m in 2013. It may be that part of the decline in overall raw material consumption stems from Britain\u2019s chronic inability to build enough homes more than anything else. The physical weight of goods imported into the UK has actually risen over the past 13 years, while the amount exported has fallen. \u201cMore materials are imported than exported and the gap between imports and exports has widened over the 2000 to 2013 period,\u201d said the ONS. \u201cThis suggests that we are becoming more reliant on the production of materials in other countries, which may be related to the reduced cost of sourcing some products from abroad.\u201d But the UK\u2019s environmental accounts attempt to factor in the way goods are now made abroad. The ONS said that the per-capita consumption of raw materials in the UK is 8.9 tonnes per year, but after imports and exports are taken into account the figure rises to 10.3. This article was amended on 1 March 2016 to remove comments from Tim Jackson that said the ONS counted metal used to make cars but not metal in finished cars. The ONS said it counts both.",

Households now <a href=\"http://www.carboncommentary.com/blog/2016/2/24/peak-stuff-households-now-spent-more-on-services-than-physical-goods\">spend more on services</a> than physical goods, he said. </p> <p>\u201cPart of the reason for the reduction in UK material use is the growing impact of digitisation. But we are also tending to eat less food and use less water, for example. <br></p> <p>\u201cAnd across a wide range of industries, the economy is tending to use a smaller weight of materials as a result of better efficiency and because homes and offices now have pretty much all the equipment they need,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Consumption of paper and cardboard began to decline in 2001, the amount of household waste produced by each person in the UK began to fall in 2003, and consumption of water began to go down from 2004, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/31/consumption-of-goods-falling\">all at a time of rising population and GDP</a>.</p> <p>The ONS figures suggest that consumption of raw materials per head in Britain is now among the lowest in Europe, behind only Spain. But Goodall added that countries across the globe are using less.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to see the same in China. Steel and cement \u2013 by far the most important inputs to the economy in terms of weight \u2013 have peaked. And since China represents about 50% of world steel consumption, this has a global impact.\u201d</p> <p>Even the total weight of biomass consumed in the UK has fallen, despite a rising population. The ONS said that in 2000 the UK chomped and burned its way through 188m tonnes of crops, fish and wood, compared with 172.5m in 2013, the last year for which figures are available.</p> <p>Fossil fuel consumption peaked in 2001 at 283m tonnes. In 2012 it was 249m tonnes, although this was an increase on the lows of 2008-09. </p> <p>But the country\u2019s environmental accounts can be interpreted in many ways. The switch to a service-based economy rather than a manufacturing one means Britain consumes far fewer materials and energy for every unit of economic output compared with economies such as Germany. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/nov/26/black-friday-buy-nothing-day\">Why I'm buying nothing for a year \u2013 no clothes, no holidays, no coffee ...</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The amount of materials and energy that goes into making, say, an Adele music download or a shipping insurance policy in Britain are tiny compared with making a car in Germany, so it means that for each unit of economic output Britain uses relatively fewer material resources. </p> <p>The ONS suggested that the link between material consumption and economic growth is \u201cdecoupling\u201d, with Britain having become more efficient at increasing output while using fewer resources. </p> <p>The ONS said: \u201cOver the 2000 to 2013 period, resource productivity (the relationship between economic activity and material consumption) in the UK has positively increased, rising 59.4% from \u00a31.87 per kg in 2000 to \u00a32.98 per kg in 2013, reflecting the shift away from manufacturing towards financial and other service industries.\u201d<br></p> <p>But other data show British households gorging on consumer goods. <a href=\"http://www.smmt.co.uk/2016/01/record-year-for-new-car-market-as-registrations-hit-2-6-million-in-2015/\">Car sales</a> hit an unprecedented 2.63m in 2015, while Primark\u2019s UK sales have accelerated to more than \u00a35bn as shoppers load their baskets with skinny jeans and playsuits. So are the British really consuming less? </p> <p>One expert said the amount the UK consumed has increased since the turn of the millennium, citing his extrapolation of data from the UN environment programme.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cThere are indications of saturation in some markets, such as with Ikea on furnishings. You do see these micro trends of peak stuff, but the idea we\u2019re living in a peak stuff world is nuts,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/22/economic-growth-climate-change-problems-tim-jackson\">Tim Jackson, professor of sustainable development</a> at the University of Surrey.</p> <p>A closer analysis of the ONS figures shows a big drop in consumption of non-metallic minerals used by the construction industry, such as sand, gravel, limestone and gypsum. This collapsed from 321m tonnes in 2000 to 212m in 2013. It may be that part of the decline in overall raw material consumption stems from Britain\u2019s chronic inability to build enough homes more than anything else. </p> <p>The physical weight of goods imported into the UK has actually risen over the past 13 years, while the amount exported has fallen. \u201cMore materials are imported than exported and the gap between imports and exports has widened over the 2000 to 2013 period,\u201d said the ONS.</p> <p>\u201cThis suggests that we are becoming more reliant on the production of materials in other countries, which may be related to the reduced cost of sourcing some products from abroad.\u201d<br></p> <p>But the UK\u2019s environmental accounts attempt to factor in the way goods are now made abroad. The ONS said that the per-capita consumption of raw materials in the UK is 8.9 tonnes per year, but after imports and exports are taken into account the figure rises to 10.3. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/02/material_consumption/giv-27167jcRH7QLgoHsg/\" data-alt=\"per capita consumption\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/02/material_consumption/giv-27167jcRH7QLgoHsg/\">per capita consumption</a> </figure>  <ul> <li>This article was amended on 1 March 2016 to remove comments from Tim Jackson that said the ONS counted metal used to make cars but not metal in finished cars.

      "bodyText": "Despite continuing worries about the global economy, as well as disappointment that there were no new stimulus measures announced by G20 finance ministers following their meeting in Shanghai, shares held up pretty well on the last day of the month. A rise in crude prices after comments from Saudi Arabia about wanting to limit volatilty helped support markets, as did news that China was acting to try and boost bank lending and reduce borrowing costs. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 1.08 points or 0.02% higher at 6097.09, up 0.22% on the month Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.19% to 9495.40 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.9% at 4353.55 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.8% to 17,623.07 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.34% at 8461.4 In Greece, the Athens market rose 1.89% to 516.71 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 49 points or 0.3%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the February manufacturing PMIs and Barclays results. As European markets close in mixed fashion, Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is finishing up the day\u2019s session broadly flat \u2013 we\u2019re still below where we started the year, but sentiment does appear to be on the up. There was disappointment that we didn\u2019t see more clarity out of the G20 meeting at the weekend, so it\u2019s arguably quite surprising that we haven\u2019t seen additional downside pressures as a result. ... Where March takes the market remains to be seen \u2013 the tide does appear to have turned with regard to London\u2019s FTSE-100 now being well beyond bear market territory and critically oil prices appear to be nudging higher, too. That said, the support we\u2019re seeing for gold does suggest that there\u2019s still a lack of confidence when it comes to the medium term view. An unexpected drop in US home sales adds to the weak data already seen. Reuters reports: Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell to their lowest level in a year in January, likely weighed down by harsh weather and a shortage of properties for sale, a report showed on Monday. The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index declined 2.5 percent to 106.0, the lowest level since January of last year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts rising 0.5 percent last month. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and January\u2019s unexpected drop suggested home resales will likely weaken after rising only 0.4 percent last month. Contracts were up 1.4 percent from a year ago. The rally in stock markets could continue despite today\u2019s uncertain performance, says Chris Beauchamp at IG: February is going out on a dull note, with markets around the globe ending the month in mixed form. Europe and the UK are broadly lower, with an absence of heavyweight economic and corporate news (after all, who wants to publish data on a leap day?) adding to the general lack of direction. The real fireworks come later in the week, with China data galore and then US non-farms on Friday. As a result, some of the month\u2019s gains are being booked with an eye to buffing up returns for February. However, while this rally has been in effect for two weeks now, it doesn\u2019t really show much sign of stopping, especially since we are hitting a strong historical period for stocks. So long as everyone keeps looking for a reason for the next selloff, the default direction for the market is upwards. The performance of crude oil remains the most important element in this market, and with both Brent and WTI holding up well today there is every reason to expect more upside. Too many traders have been caught out trying to short the market over the past week or so, with little sign so far that the bounce has run its course. China will kick off the manufacturing PMI numbers for February tonight, and there could well be a big impact on market sentiment: More downbeat data from the US: The planned merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse poses competition issues, according to France\u2019s economy minister Emmanuel Macron. The deal would hit smaller exchanges such as Euronext Paris. Macron told reporters (quotes courtesy Reuters): We will assess the consequences in strategic terms for Paris\u2019 financial centre. He also raised doubts about the impact of any British exit from Europe on the deal: I think we should assess the possible consequences of a Brexit on such a merger. The G20 was right to list a UK exit from the European Union as a potential risk to the global economy in its statement following last week\u2019s meeting of finance ministers in Shanghai, says Capital Economics. But the research group\u2019s chief global economist Julian Jessop said: However, the negative impacts of \u2018Brexit\u2019 are likely to be smaller than many fear, including the short-term costs to the UK itself. More speculatively, there may even be some positives for the world economy \u2013 notably the additional pressure for more growth-friendly policies in the remainder of the EU. In our view... while Brexit would have global ramifications, these should not be overstated, nor need they all be negative. For a start, we doubt the disruption to the UK economy would be as large as many fear. In particular, the uncertainties about the UK\u2019s relations with the rest of Europe could be reduced during the period of negotiations before exit actually takes place. And unlike some potential euro departures, the UK already has its own currency and would be opting to leave rather than being pushed out. The UK would surely also swiftly reassert its commitment to international organisations like NATO and to cooperation with other Western powers in areas of common geopolitical interests. What\u2019s more, even if the UK economy does initially struggle following Brexit, it only accounts for around 4% of world GDP. Indeed, some of the feared costs to the UK \u2013 such as the relocation of international companies to the Continent \u2013 would not have any net impact on the global economy... [And] it is surely inconsistent to argue \u2013 as some do \u2013 that Brexit would both be a disaster for the UK and encourage other member states to quit the EU as well. It is even possible \u2013 though perhaps only wishful thinking at this stage \u2013 that Brexit would be the catalyst for much-needed structural reform in the remainder of the EU, as well as a shift away from austerity. In this (admittedly rosy) scenario, Brexit might yet prove to be a long-term positive both for the UK and for the world economy. Meanwhile there are more signs of weakness in the US economy, with the Chicago purchasing managers index coming in lower than expected. The index fell from 55.6 in January to 47.6 in February, compared to forecasts of a figure of 53. The PMIs for the US as a whole are due on Tuesday (along with the data for Europe and the UK among others). US markets are marginally higher in early trading, helped by a rise in the oil price. Brent crude is currently up 1.9% at $35.78 a barrel on hopes that oil producers could act to stem the slide in prices. That was helped by Saudi Arabia saying in a statement that it \u201cseeks to achieve stability in the oil markets and will always remain in contact with all main producers in an attempt to limit volatility and it welcomes any co-operative action.\u201d Saudia Arabia and Russia agreed a proposal earlier this month to freeze output at January levels, but Iran is keen to increase production now sanctions against the country have been lifted and it has renewed access to export markets. Iran said on Monday it had increased exports sharply over the past month. So despite continuing worries about the global economy, notably China, and no new stimulus measures agreed by G20 finance ministers over the weekend, US markets have made a vaguely positive start, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently up 18 points or 0.1%. Directors at Royal Bank of Scotland must be hoping the shares have reached their bottom. Chief executive Ross McEwan and finance director Ewen Stevenson have both spent nearly \u00a3450,000 or 223p a share on buying 200,000 shares, while chairman Howard Davis has snapped up 40,000 at 222p each. So far their faith is not reaping much reward. RBS shares are currently down 0.6p at 226p. With the eurozone falling back into deflation, the odds on the European Central Bank acting at its meeting next week are growing. Time for a quick recap. Britain has been warned that the pound could slide to parity with the euro if the public votes to leave the EU. Analysts at UBS predicted that sterling would lose around 20% of its value after Brexit, but would strengthen if the Remain side win. They warned that the pound has also been hurt by the EU referendum, pushing it down to 78p to the \u20ac1. In our view, the largest part of the weakness in sterling since November can be attributed to increased concern over the possibility of exit from the EU. ... We think that the result of the referendum will be one of the UK to remain in the EU, thus our forecast is that sterling will eventually strengthen back to 73p. However, we expect some further weakness of sterling between now and the vote on 23 June. And if Britain chooses to Leave the EU, the pound would slide to parity against the euro, UBS reckons. Here\u2019s the key forecast: In other news.... China has eased monetary policy, as Beijing tries to protect its economy from a hard landing. The People\u2019s Bank of China cut the Reserve Requirement Ratio on its banks by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage points), to boost liquidity and credit availability. Economists say more will be needed, though, to cushion the economy. The former governor of the Bank of England has claimed that the eurozone is doomed to failure. In a new book, Lord Mervyn King warned that the public will revolt against mass unemployment and perpetual austerity, if policymakers try to impose closer political union to tackle its problems. He says: Monetary union has created a conflict between a centralised elite on the one hand, and the forces of democracy at the national level on the other. King also argued that Greece needs major debt relief, and a cheaper currency, to end its long economic woes. Campaigners have welcomed the move, arguing that Athens creditors must swallow reality Investors are expecting more stimulus measures from the European Central Bank, after the euro ares slipped back into deflation. Prices fell by 0.2% annually this month, the first negative move since last September. Back in the UK, Amazon has sent shivers through the supermarket sector through a new deal with Morrisons. Under the tie-up, the web giant will sell hundreds of Morrison\u2019s food products to its Amazon Prime customers. This is a fillip for Morrisons, helping the struggling group to sell more items across the UK. Its shares are up 4% so far today. But it\u2019s a blow to Ocado; shares in the online supermarket chain have slumped by 9% as the City sees Amazon eating its market share. And Tesco is also being hit - its shares have lost 2.6% today. John Ibbotson of the retail consultants, Retail Vision, says Amazon could be a serious threat to the major markets: It\u2019s now game on for the rest of the Big Four, who suddenly don\u2019t look so big after all. Tesco could soon be about to find out what it\u2019s like to be David rather than Goliath.\u201dThe problem for the Big Four is that if you pay \u00a379 a year for Amazon Prime, you get the delivery free. Amazon seems content to deliver at a loss indefinitely. Gerard Lyons, chief economic advisor to London mayor (and Brexit campaigner) Boris Johnson, is tweeting about the Chinese RRR cut too. He believes it should help the economy, but also warns it could intensify talk of a currency war (the yuan hit a three-week low when the news was announced) Philip Uglow, chief economist at MNI Indicators, suggests China was right to cut the reserve requirements on its banks today, given its weakening economy. He says: \u201cGiven the continued slowdown in the Chinese economy, it was not too surprising to see the central bank step in once again and loosen policy. The reserve requirement still remains at a relatively high level and there is plenty of room for more easing if needed. Our own survey data showed a significant weakening in February, with the MNI China Business Sentiment Indicator dipping below the all-important 50 mark. The Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator also turned lower in February, clouding the outlook for spending over the coming months.\u201d Britain\u2019s smaller City banks and investment companies are being spared new European rules on bonuses, designed to avoid excessive risk-taking. The UK\u2019s financial regulators have just announced that the rules, which restrict bonuses to 100% of base salary, will only be imposed on big banks and financial firms who are \u201csystemically important\u201d. In a statement, the Bank of England argues that a \u2018blanket ban\u2019 on bonuses would be counter-productive, by pushing up basic pay. Since the introduction of the bonus cap, a number of firms have markedly increased fixed pay as a percentage of total pay, whilst total pay remained stable during the same period. The PRA and FCA believe that the shift to fixed remuneration makes it more difficult for firms to adjust variable remuneration to reflect their financial health, and limits deferral arrangements that put remuneration at risk should financial or conduct risks subsequently come to light. City AM has a good early take: Smaller UK banks and investment firms will not have to abide by EU bonus cap rules \u2013 FCA and PRA And Juliet Samuel of the Wall Street Journal tweets: Money is continuing to pour into Eurozone government debt this morning. This is driving down the interest rate, or yield, on safe-haven bonds. German 10-year bunds have hit a yield of just 0.12%, a 10-month low, meaning investors are accepting virtually no return on their money. It\u2019s another sign of pessimism in the markets, with investors primarily worried about keeping their money safe rather than growing it. Debt campaigners have welcomed Mervyn King\u2019s warning that a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of Greece\u2019s debts must be written off. But Tim Jones, economist at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, also warns that the current proposals for debt relief fall short: \u201cLord King\u2019s comments are yet another acknowledgment that Greece needs substantial debt cancellation, both for its own recovery, and the wider European economy. Yet even if implemented, the current discussions on debt relief for Greece would not reduce payments for at least 15 years, and would leave them 10 times higher than Germany was paying after it had substantial debt cancellation in 1953.\u201d It takes more than a global market rout to alarm Warren Buffett. The billionaire US investor is sounding remarkably relaxed this morning, as he appears on CNBC. Buffett has revealed that his Berkshire Hathaway fund has been buying shares in 2016, despite the heavy falls on some markets. According to the 85-year old, \u201cnot much\u201d happened in the markets recently. He\u2019s also expecting the \u201cpositive effects of low oil prices\u201d to help the world economy in the months ahead. \u201cNot much\u201d is an interesting way of summing up the recent market moves. So far this year, the Nasdaq has lost 7.8% of its value while the Dow Jones Industrial average is off 5%. Across the globe, the German DAX has lost 12% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei has shed almost 16%. But Buffett made his name, and his fortune, by buying and holding stocks, so he knows what he\u2019s doing..... Today\u2019s surprise cut in China\u2019s Reserve Requirement Ratio will help stabilise the Chinese financial system, says Duncan Innes-Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit. But it isn\u2019t enough on its own, he adds: \u201cThe latest cut in the RRR shows the central bank straining to maintain loose monetary conditions in a difficult economic climate. The move will partly offset the effects of capital outflows from China and the provisioning requirements that are forcing banks to lock up more funds as non-performing loans climb. However, the surge in loans in January highlighted concerns that bank lending may be spiralling out of control. Ultimately, China\u2019s economy cannot grow on credit alone. It needs further reforms to unlock productivity growth.\u201d Nordea analyst Aurelija Augulyte reckons China has the capacity to do more, given it still holds over $3trn of foreign exchange reserves: Today\u2019s in deflation figures also show that the ECB\u2019s existing stimulus programme hasn\u2019t actually worked yet. The ECB is buying \u20ac60bn of assets each month, widening its balance sheet, but having little obvious impact on the consumer prices index (CPI) The eurozone\u2019s lurch back into deflation means Mario Draghi is certain to announce new measures to stimulate the European economy in two week\u2019s time. So argues Teunis Brosens of ING, who writes: The weakening of core inflation shows the real and present danger that cheap oil will cause low inflation to become ingrained in Eurozone price and wage dynamics. This is especially bad for debt-laden households, businesses and governments in Southern Europe, which will have little scope to \u201cinflate away\u201d their debt burden by increasing nominal wages. Today\u2019s weak core inflation gives doves the upper hand at next week\u2019s ECB-meeting and therefore pretty much seals the deal on additional monetary easing. In another alarming sign, the eurozone has slumped back into deflation for the first time in five months. Prices across the single currency region fell by 0.2% in February, according to data just released by Eurostat. That\u2019s worse than expected, and is the first negative inflation reading since September. Energy prices were the main factor, but price pressures in other areas of the economy were also weak. Core inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as food and fuel, dropped to just 0.7% from 1% in January. It raises the pressure on the European Central Bank to ease monetary policy again at its March meeting. The Chinese central bank says it cut the RRR rate, to guarantee \u201cample liquidity\u201d in the financial sector, and to encourage \u201cappropriate growth\u201d in the credit market. The 50bp cut lowers the Reserve Requirement Ratio to 17%, meaning banks need to hold fewer assets in reserve and can offer cheaper credit. A lower RRR will give Chinese banks the leeway to lower borrowing costs, and to make more money available to domestic companies and borrowers. Breaking news from China! The People\u2019s Bank of China has just eased monetary policy, by cutting the RRR - or Reserve Rate Requirement. Swiss bank UBS has just piled into the Brexit debate, saying there is a 40% chance that Britain will vote to leave the EU in June. In a new report, UBS predicts that sterling would be hit hard if Britain left the EU. It estimates that the pound would hit parity with the euro, which would help UK exporters but make trips to the continent much pricier. Currently, sterling is trading around \u20ac1.27, meaning one euro is worth roughly 78p. UBS reckons it will weaken to around 84p by June, and could then either sharply recover, or weaken, depending on the result. That\u2019s an interesting call from UBS. Other analysts have predicted that the euro would also be hit by Brexit - as it would raise new fears over the future of the eurozone. Here\u2019s a flavour of UBS\u2019s report: A date for referendum is set and the pound is getting pounded The United Kingdom reached an agreement with the European Union and the UK announced that the referendum vote will take place on 23 June 2016 (see \u201cBrexit: An ever closer referendum\u201d). We map out where the pound could go in the event of a \u201cBrexit\u201d, how much of a rebound is likely with a vote to \u201cRemain\u201d, and the potential for further currency weakness between now and June. What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to stay in the European Union? We think that EUR/GBP should revert to the 0.73 level, near which it spent most of last year. In our view, the largest part of the weakness in sterling since November can be attributed to increased concern over the possibility of exit from the EU. What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to leave (\u201cBrexit\u201d)? We estimate the exchange rate level that would accommodate a sharp correction in the UK\u2019s current account deficit and find that EUR/GBP could go to parity. What probabilities do we assign to each outcome? We assign a 60% probability to the UK staying in the EU and up to 40% probability of a vote to leave, as we have argued previously based on published opinion polls. Our baseline forecast is 0.73 for the end of 2016 We think that the result of the referendum will be one of the UK to remain in the EU, thus our forecast is that sterling will eventually strengthen back to 0.73. However, we expect some further weakness of sterling between now and the vote on 23 June. But a vote to leave would push EUR/GBP to 1.00 The price action so far makes it clear that sterling would weaken in the event of an exit vote. We think that the market would re-price to parity \u2013 and to the extent that it could accommodate a shift in the current account by 2.7% of GDP. Breaking: UK mortgage approvals have hit their highest level in two years. A total of 74,600 new home loans were approved last month, implying that the British housing market remains pretty robust. Here\u2019s a jaw-dropping fact -- China is planning to lay off almost two million workers from its coal and steel industry. It\u2019s part of Beijing\u2019s attempts to cut capacity in the sector in response to slowing demand, and to rebalance the wider economy towards consumption. Reuters has the details: Yin Weimin, the minister for human resources and social security, told a news conference on Monday that 1.3 million workers in the coal sector could lose their jobs, plus 500,000 from the steel sector. China\u2019s coal and steel sectors employ about 12 million workers, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics. \u201cThis involves the resettlement of a total of 1.8 million workers. This task will be very difficult, but we are still very confident,\u201d Yin said.... European stock markets have opened lower, amid disappointment that the world\u2019s top finance ministers didn\u2019t announce any concrete measures at their meeting last week. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 38 points, or 0.6%, to 6057 points. The French and German markets are down around 0.9%, following moderate losses in Asia overnight which clocked 1% off Japan\u2019s Nikkei. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, sums up the mood: Markets are kicking off the last trading day of February on a rather downbeat note with the weekend\u2019s G20 meeting of finance ministers in Shanghai almost appearing to have muddied the waters, rather than provided any clarity. Policymakers appear to be in agreement that they need to act in a coordinated manner, but given the reactions we\u2019ve seen so far, that certainly doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. The G20 meeting ended with a communique which warned that the global recovery was \u201cuneven\u201d and failing to deliver \u201cstrong, sustainable and balanced growth\u201d. But in terms of action, it only committed to \u201cfurther enhancing the structural reform agenda\u201d They also warned against Britain leaving the European Union. But as the Guardian reported yesterday, that was added on the insistence of the UK government..... Mervyn King also warns that Greece needs debt relief and a cheaper currency: As he puts it: It is evident, as it has been for a very long while, that the only way forward for Greece is to default on (or be forgiven) a substantial proportion of its debt burden and to devalue its currency so that exports and the substitution of domestic products for imports can compensate for the depressing effects of the fiscal contraction imposed to date. Athens was promised some debt relief as part of its third bailout, agreed last summer. But those talks are on ice right now, as negotiations with its lenders over implementation of the package continue to grind slowly onwards. The Chinese stock market has closed at its lowest level in a month, as fears over the global economy dogged trading floors again. At one stage, the Shanghai Composite was heading for a 15-month low, before finishing down 2.8%. Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank blamed the lack of firm action at last weekend\u2019s G20 meeting: He told Bloomberg: [Finance ministers delivered an]....admission of downside growth risks but no tangible commitments to fiscal policy action in particular to bolster growth in the short term\u201d As a devoted Aston Villa fan, Lord Mervyn King must have relegation on the brain right now. In his new book, the BoE governor suggests that the eurozone missed a trick in 2012 by now allowing struggling eurozone members to be \u201ctemporarily\u201d shunted down to a lower tier. Then they could have won promotion again once they had established closer convergence with their stronger neighbours. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble apparently proposed this to Greece last summer -- but the idea was rejected. The big fear (as many football fans can attest), is that once you\u2019re relegated, there\u2019s no guarantee of getting back. And \u2018relegation\u2019 could also encourage traders to force weaker members out of the euro. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group, agrees: Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, the Telegraph\u2019s international business editor, reckons King\u2019s intervention is very significant. Otmar Issing was Germany\u2019s representative on the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, and thus an influential voice . Lord King also suggests that Germany, rather than Greece, might pull the trigger on the eurozone. He writes: Germany faces a terrible choice. Should it support the weaker brethren in the euro area at great and unending cost to its taxpayers, or should it call a halt to the project of monetary union across the whole of Europe? The attempt to find a middle course is not working. One day, German voters may rebel against the losses imposed on them by the need to support their weaker brethren, and undoubtedly the easiest way to divide the euro area would be for Germany itself to exit. Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, has fired a fierce broadside at the eurozone - claiming the single currency block may be doomed. In a new book, the man who steered Britain\u2019s central bank through (and into) the financial crisis warned that the tensions within eurozone - and the huge debts piled up by struggling members such as Greece - can never be fully resolved. Crucially, King also argues that any moves to harden up the single currency could also backfire. Closer political union (which would make it easier to forgive Greece\u2019s debts) will actually inflame popular anger against the eurozone project. As he puts it: \u201cMonetary union has created a conflict between a centralised elite on the one hand, and the forces of democracy at the national level on the other. This is extraordinarily dangerous.\u201d Breaking up the 18-member strong union may be the only way to allow Europe\u2019s struggling Southern states to regain competitiveness. Here\u2019s more from King, via the Daily Telegraph (who have the serialisation rights): The more likely cause of a break- up of the euro area is that voters in the south will tire of the grinding and relentless burden of mass unemployment and the emigration of talented young people. The counter-argument \u2013 that exit from the euro area would lead to chaos, falls in living standards and continuing uncertainty about the survival of the currency union \u2013 has real weight. If the members of the euro decide to hang together, the burden of servicing external debts may become too great to remain consistent with political stability. But if the alternative is crushing austerity, continuing mass unemployment, and no end in sight to the burden of debt, then leaving the euro area may be the only way to plot a route back to economic growth and full employment. The long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs. Outsiders cannot make that choice, but they can encourage Germany, and the rest of the euro area, to face up to it. If the members of the euro decide to hang together, the burden of servicing external debts may become too great to remain consistent with political stability. As John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1922, \u201cIt is foolish\u2026 to suppose that any means exist by which one modern nation can exact from another an annual tribute continuing over many years.\u201d Here\u2019s the full piece: Daily Telegraph: Lord Mervyn King: \u2018Forgive them their debts\u2019 is not the answer Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be February 29th, but investors aren\u2019t exactly leaping for joy this morning. Asian markets are falling, and European bourses are likely to follow suit. Several issues dominate the trading floors right now, including: The state of the global economy, with China\u2019s weaknesses threatening a wider slowdown. Angst over the US elections. Donald Trump\u2019s success at the Republican caucuses is alarming many observers, while Wall Street fears that Bernie Sanders\u2019 has put inequality firmly in the spotlight. The eurozone: The refugee crisis is piling new stress on the region, with inflation still worryingly weak The Brexit question, with polls suggesting the EU referendum on June 23 could be close. Worries about negative interest rates, and fears that central bankers are running out of ammo. But despite these fears, finance ministers didn\u2019t agree any new measures at their G20 meeting last weekend. And for some investors, that\u2019s a decent reason to keep out of the markets...or cut their holdings. Coming up this morning... There\u2019s not much on the agenda, but we do get fresh eurozone inflation data at 10am GMT. That is expected to show a further weakening in price pressures, with the consumer prices index tipped to drop to 0% from 0.3% in January. And at 9.30, the latest UK consumer credit and mortgage lending figure are out.",

More speculatively, there may even be some positives for the world economy \u2013 notably the additional pressure for more growth-friendly policies in the remainder of the EU.</p> <p> In our view... while Brexit would have global ramifications, these should not be overstated, nor need they all be negative. For a start, we doubt the disruption to the UK economy would be as large as many fear. In particular, the uncertainties about the UK\u2019s relations with the rest of Europe could be reduced during the period of negotiations before exit actually takes place. And unlike some potential euro departures, the UK already has its own currency and would be opting to leave rather than being pushed out. The UK would surely also swiftly reassert its commitment to international organisations like NATO and to cooperation with other Western powers in areas of common geopolitical interests.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, even if the UK economy does initially struggle following Brexit, it only accounts for around 4% of world GDP.

The long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs. Outsiders cannot make that choice, but they can encourage Germany, and the rest of the euro area, to face up to it.</p> <p>If the members of the euro decide to hang together, the burden of servicing external debts may become too great to remain consistent with political stability.

    "webTitle": "Small financial firms will escape EU bonus cap, says Bank of England", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 1,000 fund managers, hedge funds, brokers and smaller banks will be exempt from the EU\u2019s bonus cap after the Bank of England said it had concluded they did not fall within the scope of the rules. The cap limits bonuses to one times salary \u2013 or twice if shareholders approve \u2013 and is opposed by the Bank, which argues that it pushes up fixed pay and makes it harder to claw back bonuses when things go wrong. The Bank has told the European Banking Authority, which oversees European banking regulation, that is does not intend to broaden coverage of the cap beyond 100 or so City firms because it does not believe the others are big enough to need to comply. The bonus cap was introduced two years ago in response to the financial crisis when it was argued huge bonuses had encouraged managers to take risks that put the stability of the entire banking system in jeopardy. The move to limit the cap to the biggest banks in the UK has been prompted by guidelines issued by the EBA at the end of last year, when it pointed out that countries across the EU were making their own exemptions to the rules, including the UK. A spokesperson for the European commission \u2013 which can take action against countries breaching directives \u2013 said it would look at the information provided by the EBA. \u201cAt this stage it is too early to talk about whether or not to launch infringement proceedings. The commission needs to first carefully look into and assess the detailed information provided by EBA.\u201d As it announced it had told the EBA that it was continuing with its decision to exempt firms, the Bank said: \u201cSince the introduction of the bonus cap, a number of firms have markedly increased fixed pay as a percentage of total pay, while total pay remained stable during the same period.\u201d In its joint statement with the Financial Conduct Authority, the Bank said that UK regulators \u201cbelieve that the shift to fixed remuneration makes it more difficult for firms to adjust variable remuneration to reflect their financial health, and limits deferral arrangements that put remuneration at risk should financial or conduct risks subsequently come to light\u201d. The EBA has supported some changes to the rules, such as amending the EU directive to exclude small firms and employees who are paid bonuses that are small compared with their salary, along with requiring bonuses to be deferred over a number of years. The EBA has also delayed the final guidelines on implementation of the rules across the EU by a year to January 2017 to allow time for changes to be made. The remuneration rules are currently being reviewed by the European commission.

At Morrisons, its chief executive, David Potts, has signed a deal to supply hundreds of fresh, frozen and ambient products to Amazon. On the principle that it\u2019s better to be cuddly with the Amazonian monster, rather than stand in its path, Morrisons is being pragmatic, as befits a company that was late to the online game. Morrisons is also the one major supermarket that produces a lot of its own grub, by owning farms and manufacturing facilities. Arguably, that alters the economics of a tie-up with Amazon. Morrisons can still hope to make a profit as a manufacturer and wholesaler on its Amazon lines, even if it is surrendering the retailer\u2019s profit margin. What\u2019s more, Potts also breaks Morrisons\u2019 previous reliance on Ocado\u2019s services in the online market. He now has two partners. Trying gamely to sound cheerful about this development, Ocado\u2019s chief executive, Tim Steiner, describes his own possible extended distribution deal with Morrisons as a \u201cwin-win arrangement\u201d. Perhaps it will be, but it hasn\u2019t been signed yet and Morrisons says it will proceed only if it brings \u201cprofitable online growth\u201d. That sounds like code for Potts demanding better terms than his predecessor signed in the original Morrisons-Ocado partnership. If it happens, the latest deal will differ from the first in two important ways. First, Morrisons won\u2019t be putting up capital to buy half the Erith warehouse in south-east London, as it did at Dordon in Warwickshire. Second, for Morrisons deliveries in Scotland, Cornwall and parts of the north of England, a \u201cstore pick\u201d model will be used, which runs counter to Ocado\u2019s core philosophy that centralised distribution is always best. Maybe such compromises are just the price of getting things done, but it\u2019s yet another thing for Ocado\u2019s shareholders to worry about. They were promised a deal with an international retailer by the end of last year. That hasn\u2019t happened yet, and instead there\u2019s a different type of deal with an established customer that is now cosying up to Amazon. The commercial terms (confidential, of course) will be all-important but the landscape is starting to look a tad complicated in Ocado-land. Waitrose supplies Ocado, as well as running a competing online offer. Ocado will run a fully national home delivery service for Morrisons, but Morrisons will also supply Amazon, which in theory could become a direct competitor to Ocado. It looks messy. As for the idea of Amazon buying Ocado, that seems a non-starter. For the rest of the supermarket sector, the question is whether Amazon is finally getting serious about groceries in the UK. The addition of \u201chundreds\u201d \u2013 but not thousands \u2013 of Morrsions lines is an upgrade but not a game-changer. Amazon is still behaving more like a souped-up convenience store.

      "bodyText": "Amazon is to start selling food from one of Britain\u2019s biggest supermarkets in a groundbreaking tie-up that highlights the dramatic shifts in grocery shopping. Fresh, chilled and frozen food made by Morrisons will be available on Amazon within the next few months on its Prime Now and Pantry services. The tie-up between Amazon and Morrisons, which was founded in 1899, underlines the growing prominence of the US company in the retail industry. It was announced on the day that the British Retail Consortium, the industry trade body, warned that almost 1m retail jobs could disappear over the next decade because of technological developments and the growing cost of running bricks-and-mortar shops. Online accounted for 6.7% of grocery sales last year. However, the category grew by 9% year-on-year at a time when the wider market is in decline. Amazon already offers its own grocery service called Amazon Fresh in a handful of US cities. However, in the UK it has been expanding its range of grocery products through Prime Now and Pantry. Its collection of fresh and frozen food has been negligible until now, but the deal with Morrisons paves the way for Amazon to ramp up its expansion in the grocery market. Prime Now delivers products to customers within one hour for \u00a36.99. It is available in London, Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester and Liverpool but is expanding fast. Amazon Pantry is a nationwide service that allows shoppers to build up a box of grocery items for delivery the next day. Retail analysts said Amazon\u2019s expansion into fresh food could lead to a further shakeup of grocery shopping, with the \u201cbig four\u201d of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons already battling against falling sales. John Ibbotson at consultancy Retail Vision said: \u201cTesco could soon be about to find out what it\u2019s like to be David rather than Goliath. \u201cThe only winner is the consumer. The big four are fighting back with click-and-collect, but who will want that if Amazon delivers to your door in one hour? \u201cThis deal is the final link in the chain for Amazon to launch Amazon Pantry and take on the big four by delivering a full grocery offer including fresh and frozen food.\u201d The US online retailer will offer customers hundreds of Morrisons products through its existing services, including fresh, frozen and chilled foods. The full list of products has not been released but Amazon says it will include orange juice, chocolate, spaghetti and soup. Amazon will be able to choose which Morrisons products it sells and their price because the agreement is a standard wholesale deal between a retailer, Amazon, and a supplier, Morrisons. However, it is unlikely that Amazon will significantly undercut Morrisons on the price of its own products because the supermarket chain could simply pull out of the deal. As well as being the UK\u2019s fourth-largest supermarket chain, Morrisons is one of the country\u2019s biggest food manufacturers, producing its own-brand food at farms and factories. However, the company\u2019s manufacturing facilities are thought to have spare capacity after it closed shops and pulled out of convenience stores, paving the way for the Amazon deal. David Potts, chief executive of Morrisons, said: \u201cToday\u2019s agreement is built on Morrisons unique strengths as a food-maker. The combination of our fresh food expertise with Amazon\u2019s online and logistics capabilities is compelling.\u201d Shares in Morrisons rose almost 6% after the deal was revealed. Analysts said that Amazon would help Morrisons to increase its market share in major cities. Bruno Monteyne, analyst at investment bank Bernstein, said: \u201cMorrisons may feel that Amazon isn\u2019t really a threat for its smaller stores in the north of England. On the contrary on our recent store visit, we saw a nice new shiny Amazon locker unit for picking up Amazon parcels. This would be a convenient divide-and-conquer outcome where Amazon and Morrisons specialise where they are best and support each other mutually.\u201d However, he warned that Morrisons may have handed Amazon a vital foothold into the UK grocery market. Monteyne added: \u201cLetting the Barbarians in\u2019 is the other potential long term outcome. Having a credible fresh food supply in the UK will allow Amazon to build scale and expertise and really make an impact on the UK food retail market.\u201d Shares in Ocado slumped by 8% in reaction to the deal due to fears that the arrival of Amazon could hurt Britain\u2019s biggest online-only food retailer. Morrisons will continue to offer its own online grocery service to customers on Morrisons.com, which is runs in partnership with Ocado. However, the company said it has reached an \u201camended agreement\u201d with Ocado about the future of Morrisons.com. The two retailers will build a new warehouse together in Erith, south London. Ocado has also developed a system that will allow Morrisons to pick Morrisons.com orders from the products in its supermarkets. This will allow the online Morrisons service to reach parts of the country where it is not presently available, such as northern England and Scotland. Ocado insisted the amended agreement, which is yet to be signed, was a \u201cwin-win\u201d for both companies. The 25-year deal between Ocado and Morrisons, signed in 2013, had been criticised as being too expensive for Morrisons. The changes are thought to mean that the supermarket retailer will pay lower fees to Ocado at the new warehouse than it does in their existing site in Dordon, Warwickshire. Duncan Tatton-Brown, Ocado\u2019s finance director, denied Morrisons had undermined the company by choosing to work with Amazon as well. \u201cI think it is encouraging. Anything that helps to grow online grocery shopping is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to the future with optimism.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A company that illegally sold on personal information and plagued members of the public with more than 46m automated nuisance calls relating to Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) mis-selling claims has received a record \u00a3350,000 fine. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), the government\u2019s data protection regulator, handed out the largest fine in its history to Prodial, singling it out as the worst case of illegal cold calling it had ever seen. Records indicated the marketing campaign could have produced a turnover of nearly \u00a31m. Despite the sums of money involved the company, which traded from a residential property in Brighton, has been placed into voluntary liquidation by one of its directors. The ICO\u2019s enforcement team is working with insolvency experts to recover the fine. The information commissioner Christopher Graham said it was \u201cone of the worst cases of cold calling we have ever come across. The volume of calls made in just a few months was staggering.\u201d More than 1,000 people complained to the ICO about the automated calls that played recorded messages relating toPPI claims. Complainants said they were called repeatedly and that often there was no opt-out facility. One person said they felt helpless that they could do nothing to stop the calls, which were very intrusive at all times of day or night. A doctor complained the constant spam calls were interfering with his work as all calls had to be answered in case of emergency. Companies can use internet phone lines to make enormous numbers of recorded marketing calls cheaply. The law states that companies can only make calls to people who have specifically consented to being contacted in this way. But the ICO investigation found Prodial had no such consent. Evidence from the ICO\u2019s investigation showed the information from these calls was used to sell people\u2019s personal details on to claims management companies. Graham said: \u201cThis was a company that knew it was breaking the law. A company director admitted that once the ICO became involved, the company shut down. \u201cThat stopped the calls, but we want to send a clear message to other firms that this type of lawbreaking will not pay. That is why we have handed out our highest ever fine. No matter what companies do to try to avoid the law, we will find a way to act.\u201d The ICO, which has the power to impose a penalty of up to \u00a3500,000, imposed more than \u00a31.1m worth of penalties for nuisance calls and text messages in 2015 \u2013 up from \u00a3330,000 in 2014 \u2013 with the same total in the pipeline for 2016. It has also ordered three Manchester-based companies to stop making unsolicited nuisance calls. Enforcement notices have been issued to a network of companies in the town of Sale, which are responsible for millions of automated nuisance calls that covered mis-sold pensions, PPI and debt management.",

Haji-Ioannou, who has also been a longstanding critic of management at the EasyJet airline he founded, called a general meeting to immediately dismiss Fastjet\u2019s chief executive, Ed Winter, and remove another director, Krista Bates, from the main board, citing concerns over costs. Winter last month announced he would step down as chief executive, pending a successor being found, but a spokesman for Haji-Ioannou, who owns a 12% stake and helped set up the Tanzania-based airline, said it was time for a \u201cclean break\u201d.

We believe the company will run out of cash sometime in 2016. We now have about six months left to steady this ship. Time is of the essence.\u201d Haji-Ioannou has balked at costs including a Fastjet head office at London Gatwick. He said: \u201cThis is not only a high cost location, when revenues are reported in local Tanzanian currency, but is also 4,750 miles away from Tanzania where the main operations and customers of Fastjet are located.\u201d He added that Fastjet was making unrealistic revenue forecasts for a fleet of six aircraft. Fastjet launched in late 2012 with domestic flights in Tanzania, with ambitions to become a pan-African budget carrier. It has since expanded its operations into South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Uganda, Malawi and Kenya, but shares plunged to a record low after a profit warning in December.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China is wobbling, oil is plummeting, Britain is threatening to quit Europe. And the gold bugs couldn\u2019t be happier. With a 15% gain in 2016, gold\u2019s rally has its diehard fans excited. But for how long? This is the metal\u2019s best start since 1980, when gold prices rallied about 270% to then all-time highs of $850 an ounce on an oil-supply shock crisis and raging inflation. This year gold prices are higher on worries over economic weakness in China and Europe, and the Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise move to negative interest rates. All the bad news has stoked some concerns of a recession, if not a full-blown economic crisis, like in 2008. After that meltdown gold prices doubled, lifting values to more than $1,900 by 2011, a nominal all-time record. Gold prices ended 2015 in a funk, but the global stock markets\u2019 shakiness and global economic worries \u201cwere just what the doctor ordered for gold bulls\u201d, said Sean Lusk, director of the commercial hedging division at Walsh Trading. Gold bugs dream of a time when the metal\u2019s value will soar, lifted by economic doom and hyperinflation from central banks\u2019 extraordinary monetary policy to revive global growth. Gold bugs\u2019 dreams have been deferred, but will this time be different? Is the yellow metal\u2019s current strength a harbinger of another move like 1980 or 2011? Doubtful, say several gold-market watchers. Gold prices may rise a bit more if the economic uncertainty continues, but the environments that fostered gold\u2019s all-time higher moves aren\u2019t the same now. Investors plowed into gold-backed exchanged-traded funds. Holdings in these funds are their highest in a year, Commerzbank said, and a catalyst to gold\u2019s move above $1,200. Joe Foster, portfolio manager of the Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund, said the surprise negative interest rate move by the BoJ, and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi\u2019s talk of more monetary stimulus, encouraged safe-haven buying. \u201cMarkets are losing faith in central banks with the radical monetary policy. We\u2019re not seeing any economic results,\u201d he said. Yet the rally may stall here. Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale, thinks gold has fully priced in the current economic uncertainty, and they would not tell their clients to buy gold now. There are not enough reasons to propel it into a new bull market. \u201cI think right now it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s going to get. The US economy is healthy,\u201d he said. Job growth and consumer sentiment is up, despite some recent softer manufacturing data reports, he said. Other investment banks also say gold\u2019s strength is temporary, such as Goldman Sachs, which recently renewed its 12-month price target of $1,000, saying fear is driving the price. Edward Meir, commodities consultant for INTL FCStone, said he advocates buying gold as an insurance policy against stock-market losses, but he does not see a repeat of gold\u2019s 2010 rally. \u201cThat was panic-buying because of the euro crisis and the financial crisis. If we get another crisis it\u2019s a possibility \u2026 This is not a new dream for the gold bulls, unless you have a doomsday scenario. Which a lot of people do. But I think we\u2019ll muddle through,\u201d Meir said. What made the rally earlier in the decade unique, too, was the debut of the gold ETF, Bhar said. Started in 2004, it was a new way to invest in gold, opening it to a new audience and fostering unprecedented demand. David Morgan, precious metals analyst and editor of the Morgan Report, a newsletter popular with gold bugs, said for now, he is unconvinced of gold\u2019s strength because silver prices are not rising in tandem with gold. \u201cI think gold may end the year higher in 2016, but I think it\u2019s going to be a 50-50 struggle between bulls and bears,\u201d he said, adding that gold bugs may be getting ahead of themselves hoping for a significant rally. That may come a few years down the line if conditions are right, he added. Like 1980 there\u2019s an oil crisis, but this year it\u2019s too much supply, and deflation is more of an issue now. Meir said people hoping for a major rally because of negative interest rates are likely to be disappointed, just as they were when hyperinflation forecasts didn\u2019t pan out. He said European banks aren\u2019t passing on the negative interest rates to consumers. And he said although ETF demand is strong, global jewelry sales, gold other demand-drivers are flat. Physical demand from top global buyers China and India is also subdued, said Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS (Switzerland) SA in Geneva. Gold\u2019s big price swings, like the upward spike to $1,260 and subsequent fall to around $1,220, makes shoppers nervous to step in and buy with conviction, he said. \u201cA lot of people are still scared. Investors need some sort of confirmation or news to see gold break above $1,250 (sustainably). Right now they\u2019re just wetting their toes,\u201d Nabavi said.",

Holdings in these funds are their highest in a year, Commerzbank said, and a catalyst to gold\u2019s move above $1,200.</p> <p>Joe Foster, portfolio manager of the Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund, said the surprise negative interest rate move by the BoJ, and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi\u2019s talk of more monetary stimulus, encouraged safe-haven buying.</p> <p>\u201cMarkets are losing faith in central banks with the radical monetary policy. We\u2019re not seeing any economic results,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yet the rally may stall here. Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale, thinks gold has fully priced in the current economic uncertainty, and they would not tell their clients to buy gold now. There are not enough reasons to propel it into a new bull market.</p> <p>\u201cI think right now it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s going to get. The US economy is healthy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Job growth and consumer sentiment is up, despite some recent softer manufacturing data reports, he said. Other investment banks also say gold\u2019s strength is temporary, such as Goldman Sachs, which recently renewed its 12-month price target of $1,000, saying fear is driving the price. </p> <p>Edward Meir, commodities consultant for INTL FCStone, said he advocates buying gold as an insurance policy against stock-market losses, but he does not see a repeat of gold\u2019s 2010 rally. </p> <p>\u201cThat was panic-buying because of the euro crisis and the financial crisis. If we get another crisis it\u2019s a possibility \u2026 This is not a new dream for the gold bulls, unless you have a doomsday scenario. Which a lot of people do. But I think we\u2019ll muddle through,\u201d Meir said.</p> <p>What made the rally earlier in the decade unique, too, was the debut of the gold ETF, Bhar said. Started in 2004, it was a new way to invest in gold, opening it to a new audience and fostering unprecedented demand.</p> <p>David Morgan, precious metals analyst and editor of the Morgan Report, a newsletter popular with gold bugs, said for now, he is unconvinced of gold\u2019s strength because silver prices are not rising in tandem with gold. </p> <p>\u201cI think gold may end the year higher in 2016, but I think it\u2019s going to be a 50-50 struggle between bulls and bears,\u201d he said, adding that gold bugs may be getting ahead of themselves hoping for a significant rally. That may come a few years down the line if conditions are right, he added.</p> <p>Like 1980 there\u2019s an oil crisis, but this year it\u2019s too much supply, and deflation is more of an issue now. Meir said people hoping for a major rally because of negative interest rates are likely to be disappointed, just as they were when hyperinflation forecasts didn\u2019t pan out. He said European banks aren\u2019t passing on the negative interest rates to consumers.</p> <p>And he said although ETF demand is strong, global jewelry sales, gold other demand-drivers are flat.</p> <p>Physical demand from top global buyers China and India is also subdued, said Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS (Switzerland) SA in Geneva. Gold\u2019s big price swings, like the upward spike to $1,260 and subsequent fall to around $1,220, makes shoppers nervous to step in and buy with conviction, he said.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people are still scared. Investors need some sort of confirmation or news to see gold break above $1,250 (sustainably). Right now they\u2019re just wetting their toes,\u201d Nabavi said. </p>",

      "bodyText": "No one wants a sick colleague, least of all their employer. Little wonder then that a host of companies are springing up to keep employees as healthy as possible. Workplace wellness is a $6bn industry in the US, according to the Rand consultancy. But the latest generation of tech-intensive wellness companies are bringing with them a host of privacy problems alongside their promises of health. In an effort to cut healthcare costs, large employers have started data mining their workers to assess their health status and target them in ways that might head off trouble. Health information company Castlight Healthcare, for example, recently developed a \u201cnew product that scans insurance claims to find women who have stopped filling birth control prescriptions, as well as women who have made fertility-related searches on Castlight\u2019s health app, according to Wall Street Journal. The data mining was designed to pinpoint women who might be attempting to get pregnant, according to Jonathan Rende, Castlight\u2019s chief research and development officer. The Castlight app would then send her emails or in-app messages geared towards pregnancy-related services like obstetricians or other pre-natal care. The news of an employer-sponsored program being able to determine that employees are trying to get pregnant alarmed privacy activists worried that employers would be able to obtain this information. \u201cWe strictly maintain complete employee confidentiality, and are fully compliant with all Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] security and administrative protocols governing protected health information,\u201d Castlight spokesman Jim Rivas said. \u201cCastlight is 100% compliant with all federal privacy laws governing the handling of employee data. Moreover, employers that use our system never, under any circumstance, see individual employee data from Castlight Action.\u201d According to Rivas, employee data \u201cis anonymized, aggregated, and all the employer ever sees is the size of the group of employees at risk for certain conditions\u201d. Castlight said it imposes a minimum on the size of the group with the intention of making it difficult to identify individual employees. Yet privacy experts still worry that such information is out there. What does your boss know? \u201cThe big worry here is: even if the data broker reports aggregate data, a) it has this information on an individual level \u2013 how else might it use it? and b) if you get granular enough, it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out who exactly the top-level data is referring to,\u201d said Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland, who studies health privacy. Pasquale\u2019s fears are backed by probably the most well-known example of this. AOL\u2019s CEO, Tim Armstrong, announced in early 2014 that \u201ctwo AOL-ers that had distressed babies that were born that we paid a million dollars each to make sure those babies were OK in general\u201d. While he did not name names, it was easy to figure out who the two employees were. Deanna Fei\u2019s husband Peter Goodman was one of those two employees. Since then, Armstrong had apologized for his comments and Fei has written a memoir, Girl in Glass, about her prematurely born daughter Mila. By default, Fei has become an advocate for health privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s now two years after my family\u2019s public ordeal with AOL, and I still hear from people all the time who were targeted by their employers because they needed medical care. Sometimes the targeting is well-intentioned, but the consequences are still disastrous,\u201d Fei said. \u201cFor example, a woman with a high-risk pregnancy who received mailings from her company that alerted her co-workers, her neighbors, and her in-laws to her condition before she even decided whether to continue with the pregnancy.\u201d If information gathered through a wellness app was obtained by the employer and had an adverse effect on the employee, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) would assume it is sex discrimination. \u201cYou are being demoted. You are denied a promotion. You are not getting a certain kind of assignments. All these kind of employment practices \u2013 those would be covered,\u201d said Mary-Kay Mauren, senior attorney adviser at the EEOC. \u201cThe issue is what the employer does with the information,\u201d said Corbett Anderson, assistant legal counsel from the EEOC office of legal counsel. According to him, the EEOC is currently working on two different rule-makings related to wellness programs. The rule-makings do not specifically address this issue, he said. Mailings like those mentioned by Fei or other communications have to be authorized by the employer, but come directly from companies like Castlight. According to the Castlight spokesman, such communications \u201cencourage certain preventive or assistive actions to be taken where they might not otherwise think to look for care\u201d. If such communications \u2013 phone calls or mailings \u2013 can be intercepted by other family members or others, it raises issues about privacy, said Dania Palanker, senior counsel at the National Women Law Center. Other privacy experts have pointed out that employers do not have access to employees\u2019 medical histories. Unless, they are provided to them by the employees through the company\u2019s wellness program. Such wellness programs have the potential to become surveillance programs, according to Ifeoma Ajunwa, who teaches law at the David A Clarke School of Law at University of the District of Columbia. \u201cI don\u2019t think all employers employ them that way,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not saying that all wellness programs are surveillance programs, but what we are seeing with the current status of the law, they do have that potential for unscrupulous employers to use them as a way to check on their employees and investigate the health of their employees.\u201d Optional versus affordable The employers and the various companies behind the wellness programs point out that all wellness programs are optional. Yet when tied to financial incentives that can make a significant difference in the price tag of one\u2019s healthcare, optional becomes \u2026 well, not so optional, experts argue. These programs are often connected to \u201clarge financial incentive that either makes your health insurance much more affordable or less affordable depending on whether you participate,\u201d said Palanker. \u201cYou could have an employee that doesn\u2019t really want to sign up for this, but they in a way have no choice, because it\u2019s the only way they can afford your healthcare.\u201d According to Deborah Peel a physician and founder of Patient Privacy Rights, the high deductibles and co-pays have contributed to deterioration of the relationship between people and their doctors. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we encourage people to see the person that really will take responsibility for their health and help them? What they have done by demonizing patients and cutting their access to effective treatment is they have created this whole new industry of profits\u201d said Peel. \u201cSo now instead of a doctor, what are you going to get? An app. Instead of a doctor! Give me a break.\u201d Financial incentives linked to wellness programs are extortion, Peel said. \u201cIf bosses really care about their employees\u2019 health, why don\u2019t they give them greater health insurance benefits and no deductible so they can go see their doctors and caretakers? How many millions are they paying to these wellness companies? Why not give the money to the employees and make it possible for them to see doctors, buy healthy food and exercise? Why not invest in the employees in a way that supports them and does not violate them?\u201d",

It is down nearly 3% at \u00a310.01, with Berenberg reducing its target price from \u00a311.60 to \u00a310.90 with a hold rating and Panmure Gordon repeating its sell advice. Panmure analyst Michael Donnelly said: The heavy fall in the share price post Capita\u2019s prelims and the exit of its chairman [Martin Bolland], plus yet another change to segmental P&amp;L and higher debt levels from public bond issues does not yet reflect the potentially significant new levels of risk in the business. Free cash flow growth at around 4% compound annual growth rate is not enough for us. Keep selling. We cut our target price to 900p (12.2 times PE) from 1000p on higher net debt and lower free cash flow. [We have] concerns on goodwill, growth, cash and quality of earnings. Donnelly said he also expected more impairment charges after Capita announced \u00a3105m from two divisions. Meanwhile Berenberg said: Capita\u2019s 2015 results were largely in line with expectations, driven by 4% organic growth and a 20 basis point underlying margin expansion (up 40 basis points including disposals). While management guides for \u201cat least\u201d the same level of organic expansion in 2016, the company has its work cut out, considering it currently has visibility on only one quarter of that growth. With returns and free cash flow generation likely to decline further in 2016 following the contraction in 2015, we maintain our hold recommendation.",

      "bodyText": "The retail sector, one of the UK\u2019s largest employers, is facing up to 900,000 job losses and the closure of thousands of shops in the next decade, according to a report by an industry body. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) warns that rising costs due to the \u201cnational living wage\u201d and the apprenticeship levy \u2013 both introduced by George Osborne in last year\u2019s budget \u2013 could increase the rate of job cuts. The BRC, which represents retail companies, stated: \u201cBoth have sound intentions but could fail on implementation. Together these effects could mean there are as many as 900,000 fewer jobs in retail by 2025 but those that remain will be more productive and higher earning.\u201d The gloomy prediction comes on the day that Amazon announced it will begin selling fresh and frozen food to UK consumers in a deal with Morrisons. The US online retailer is moving into groceries with Amazon Pantry. It is also developing its clothing offering, after helping ravage the books, music, home entertainment and consumer electronics sectors over the past decade. The retail sector employs about 3 million people \u2013 but of the 270,000 shops in the UK, up to 74,000 could shut. Nearly 30% of these could be in Wales and the north of England, the report says. Many high streets across the country have not fully recovered from the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash, when shop closures accelerated dramatically and chains including Woolworths, Zavvi and MFI disappeared. The report states: \u201cAreas that are already economically fragile are likely to see the greatest impact of store closures and some of the people affected by changing roles will be those who may find it hardest to transition into new jobs that are created.\u201d The national living wage will come into force in April, replacing the current minimum wage of \u00a36.50 an hour with a rate of \u00a37.20 for the over-25s. The BRC estimated that this will cost the industry up to \u00a33bn a year. The BRC also surveyed low-paid employees in retail, defined as workers earning less than 20% above the minimum wage, and found that 70% were female, with a mean age of 35. Sir Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of the BRC and head of the John Lewis Partnership, told the BBC that although retailers supported the introduction of higher pay, employment would be affected. \u201cPeople are not realising just how significantly the workplace is changing and I think that is dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that people assume that somehow things are going to carry on as they are, when that\u2019s unlikely. Some of the places that will be affected will be some of the most economically fragile.\u201d The BRC also reveals that the percentage of people in the retail sector on low pay has nearly doubled since 1990 to more than 60%. \u201cI do very much believe that persistent low pay needs to be tackled, which is why we\u2019re talking about \u2018fewer but better\u2019 jobs,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cWhat the national living wage does is that it increases the pace at which wages will rise - and by the way that\u2019s not a bad thing, it\u2019s in many ways a very good thing - but it will also probably accelerate some of the changes within the workforce and the responses that retailers make in order to mitigate some of the rising cost pressure that they\u2019re seeing.\u201d He added that the impact of the national living wage on employment would have to be looked at carefully and objectively. Mayfield added that the government needs to rebalance the burden of taxation \u2013 where retailers such as John Lewis pay far higher levels of tax than companies such as Amazon. \u201cHeadline reductions in corporation tax may encourage some businesses to move their tax domicile to the UK, but they are effectively being paid for by businesses who are large users of property, large employers and significant users of fuel,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe burden of taxation on the retail industry has become unsustainable and must be rebalanced.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: \u201cThe government is making sure workers in Britain get a pay rise by introducing the national living Wage from April this year. We are already seeing record employment rates and more people in employment than ever before. \u201cAnd taking into account the national living wage, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility expects employment to rise by a further 1.1m by 2020.\u201d",

But there were no concrete proposals, so with fears that China may devalue its currency again, equities are on the back foot. The FTSE 100 is down 54.42 points at 6041.59, while German and French markets have both fallen more than 1%. But in the search for havens, gold and silver are in demand, as are precious metal miners.

      "bodyText": "The release last week of the latest capital expenditure figures reminded us yet again that the mining boom is well and truly over and that this Wednesday\u2019s GDP figures will see us hoping for a strong performance from our exports. Investment has deteriorated quickly and horribly in the past year \u2013 so much so that finding any good news amid the figures requires digging through an awful lot of muck. My favorite comment on the capital expenditure figure was from economist Stephen Koukoulas who tweeted: \u201cCapex data sort of unhorrible. That is still bad, especially the outlook, but could have been worse.\u201d Welcome to Australia after the mining boom \u2013 where describing investment figures as \u201csort of unhorrible\u201d qualifies as a positive outlook. Personally I think the figures stink worse than a backed-up sewerage pipe. But Koukoulas is right in that there is some good news. The only problem is that to reach it you have to dig deep and pull out the economic equivalent of a 7m snake of baby wipes (and that might be underselling it). How badly do the figures stink? The December quarter recorded just $31.3bn worth of new investment \u2013 the lowest volume since March 2011 down 4% on the September quarter. Worst of all it was a horrific 17.8% below the level of 12 months ago: That 17.8% fall is the second largest annual fall on record, going back to 1988. The only bigger fall occurred in 1991 \u2013 in the midst of one of Australia\u2019s worst recessions. The main culprit, as ever, is the mining industry. Capital expenditure in mining fell 28% in 2015 \u2013 the worst fall since September 2000. But investment in the manufacturing and \u201cother selected\u201d industries also fell. The fall in mining investment has been so sharp that there is now more investment occurring in the \u201cother selected industries\u201d group (although it is worth remembering \u201cother selected industries\u201d is made up of 10 separate industries, the largest of which has investment about 20% that of the mining industry): The fall in \u201cother selected industries\u201d however is in some ways more concerning than that in the mining sector, because we need investment to crank up in those industries if we want to transition smoothly away from the mining boom. This was the sector that Joe Hockey and Bruce Billson targeted in last year\u2019s budget with a $20,000 instant asset write-off for small businesses. The hope was that small businesses would take the opportunity to invest in machinery and equipment. But on the surface it seems the response has been pretty pathetic. In the December quarter, investment in machinery and equipment the \u201cother selected industries\u201d sector fell 2.7%. As this followed falls in the September and June quarter, it means investment in machinery and equipment in the very sector Hockey was targeting is lower now than it was at the time of the May budget: All of which adds up to something rather worse than \u201csort of unhorrible\u201d. Fortunately the news is slightly better when we look to the future. The capital expenditure figures not only provide data on how much expenditure has been made, but also how much firms expect to invest over the coming financial year. In the latest batch of data we have the fifth estimate for capital expenditure in 2015-16 (there are seven estimates made each year, with the last one being the actual figures), and also the first estimate for investment in 2016-17. The first estimate is always lower than the final tally, so the best way to analyse it is to compare it to the first estimate of the previous year. This allows us to see whether firms are getting more optimistic about investing: And it is fair to say, they are not. The first estimate for investment in the mining industry in 2016-17 is 36.2% lower than was first estimate for 2015-16. That\u2019s a record fall. The estimate is lower than the amount the mining industry thought it would invest all the way back in 2009-10 \u2013 and this is in current dollars so the volume will be even worse. How bad is it? Well last year\u2019s budget expected mining investment in 2016-17 to fall 30.5%, so it is even worse than those very pessimistic forecasts. Even worse, the non-mining sector side is stinking up the joint as well. The budget hoped investment in the non-mining sector in 2016-17 would rise by 7.5%. Unfortunately the first estimate for investment in that area of the economy is 1.1% lower than the previous year. Cheery eh? So what is that good news? Well it is small, but significantly it in the area where Hockey and Billson were hoping to create some buzz. The plan to lift the investment in machinery and equipment appears at first glance not to have paid off. Not only is current investment in such things lower than last year, so too is the fifth estimate for 2015-16 lower than was the fifth estimate for 2014-15: But when we compare the fifth estimate to the second estimate \u2013 as that was the one made just before last year\u2019s May budget \u2013 we find a faint pleasant smell amidst the odorous refuse of the rest of the figures. While the fifth estimate is always a larger than the second estimate, it is usually only about 25% larger. The latest estimate for non-mining investment in machinery and equipment however is 43% larger than that made prior to last year\u2019s May budget \u2013 the third biggest jump on record, and the biggest since 1997-98. Clearly the $20,000 instant asset write off has had an impact. Firms are investing a lot more than they were planning to before the May budget, and the increase is much greater than normally occurs. So yes, you can say the policy has worked \u2013 but it really only translates to a state where things are \u201cnot unhorrific\u201d rather than it showing a great positive spur in investment growth. For the most part however, when you look at the capital expenditure figures, you just want to hold your nose and hope better news from exports and other areas of the economy will soon flush the smell away.",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s starter homes initiative could deliver a taxpayer-backed windfall of \u00a3141,000 each to 200,000 lucky first-time buyers, but 2 million more aspiring homeowners will be stuck renting, campaigners say. The scheme, which allows developers to replace shared ownership and affordable rented homes with properties sold at a 20% discount, has been widely criticised since it was first announced in December 2014. One of the key concerns for housing campaigners is that the homes can be sold on at the open-market rate after five years. Lobby group Generation Rent said that this meant a \u201c\u00a327bn raffle\u201d in which the original buyers stood to gain, while those who missed out would find it ever harder to get on the housing ladder. It said the scheme\u2019s potential rewards \u201cfar exceed the already generous returns of home ownership\u201d. The figures are based on average newbuild house prices and numbers of new homes being built around the country. The average cost of a newbuild property in England stands at \u00a3297,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. So as a starter home it would be bought at \u00a3238,000, Generation Rent said. If house prices rise at 5% a year, after five years the same property could be sold for \u00a3379,000. Outside London, the maximum cost of a qualifying home is \u00a3250,000 but in the capital that rises to \u00a3450,000. Generation Rent said buyers could stand to make a profit of \u00a3228,139 on a home bought for \u00a3383,200. The group is calling for the homes to be subject to rules saying that they can only be sold on at a 20% discount. Betsy Dillner, the director of Generation Rent, said this would help multiple first-time buyers \u201cinstead of a jammy handful of winners in a multibillion pound raffle\u201d. She added: \u201cThe government said its starter homes would be exclusively for first-time buyers, but by letting them vanish into the open market after five years, they\u2019re betraying the millions who are stuck renting.\u201d The housing charity Shelter last year described the properties as \u201cnon-starter homes\u201d, saying that by 2020 in more than half of the country they would be unaffordable for families earning average wages. Shelter\u2019s chief executive, Campbell Robb, said: \u201cWhile the government is offering these discounted homes to a select few, for those who aren\u2019t so lucky, all they\u2019re offering is more time spent in expensive and unstable private renting, or living with mum and dad well into their 30s. \u201cThis crisis can be turned around, but only if the government moves beyond schemes that only help the well off, and starts investing in homes that ordinary families can actually afford as well.\u201d As the House of Lords prepare to debate the policy as part of the housing bill this week, experts said there were many unanswered questions surrounding the policy. Neal Hudson, an associate director at property firm Savills, said that despite the scheme being a key plank of government housing policy \u201cthere is still a massive amount of detail outstanding on how it will work\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is likely to be a lot of uncertainty about how much people should be paying for land because they are not sure how they will be able to use it.\u201d Hudson said uncertainty remained over how the prices of starter homes would be determined if there were no comparable properties nearby, and how mortgage lenders would treat a property that could not be sold at market rate for five years. Other analysts have questioned how the policy will run alongside the government\u2019s help-to-buy loan scheme, where buyers are offered a 20% interest-free loan but must repay it when they sell. In January the head of housebuilder Taylor Wimpey said that confusion over how the scheme would work was causing problems for developers. Pete Redfern said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard if you\u2019re looking at a future site to know how that policy balance will end up, because local authorities feel more threatened by starter homes than by anything else.\u201d Research carried out by Savills for the Local Government Association (LGA) found that the discounted starter home prices were out of reach for all people in need of affordable housing in 220 council areas and for more than 90% in a further 80 council areas.",

Neal Hudson, an associate director at property firm Savills, said that despite the scheme being a key plank of government housing policy \u201cthere is still a massive amount of detail outstanding on how it will work\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere is likely to be a lot of uncertainty about how much people should be paying for land because they are not sure how they will be able to use it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hudson said uncertainty remained over how the prices of starter homes would be determined if there were no comparable properties nearby, and how mortgage lenders would treat a property that could not be sold at market rate for five years. </p> <p>Other analysts have questioned how the policy will run alongside the government\u2019s help-to-buy loan scheme, where buyers are offered a 20% interest-free loan but must repay it when they sell.</p> <p>In January the head of housebuilder Taylor Wimpey said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/11/taylor-wimpey-discount-homes-first-time-buyers\">confusion over how the scheme would work</a> was causing problems for developers. Pete Redfern said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard if you\u2019re looking at a future site to know how that policy balance will end up, because local authorities feel more threatened by starter homes than by anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Research <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/16/government-discounted-starter-home-plan-buyers\">carried out by Savills for the Local Government Association (LGA)</a> found that the discounted starter home prices were out of reach for all people in need of affordable housing in 220 council areas and for more than 90% in a further 80 council areas.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury select committee, has called for sweeping changes to how the UK produces official statistics to improve the quality of economic data. Chancellor George Osborne should use March\u2019s budget to launch a shakeup of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), urged Tyrie, who recently criticised the body for falling behind its international peers and jeopardising policy decisions with \u201crubbish\u201d statistics. Tyrie also urged Sir Charlie Bean, the former Bank of England deputy governor, to complete his final report for government into the quality of UK economics statistics in time for the 16 March budget. The chair of the cross-party committee of MPs is worried that ministers, the public and Bank of England policymakers are having to work with statistics tarred by poor data collection and production. \u201cNumbers matter \u2013 no doubt the forthcoming EU referendum will illustrate the point,\u201d he said alongside the release on Monday of new suggestions for an ONS overhaul. As part of his enquiries, Bean had asked the Treasury committee for ideas on how to improve public scrutiny and oversight of data collection. Tyrie has written back with three suggestions: a change of statistics watchdog; returning responsibility for statistics to the Treasury from the Cabinet Office, and bolstering the independence of UK statistics bodies. On the first suggestion, Tyrie said: \u201cThe UK Statistics Authority has been marking its own homework for years \u2013 operating as both producer and regulator of official statistics. This should end.\u201d Calling for the Treasury to take back responsibility of statistics, Tyrie explained: \u201cMany of the bodies that rely on the production of high quality statistics \u2013 the Bank of England and the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility], for instance \u2013 are the responsibility of the Treasury. But the UK Statistics Authority is the responsibility of the Cabinet Office, which has little or no skin in the game.\u201d On independence of UK statistics bodies, Tyrie drew parallels with the process for appointments to the fiscal watchdog, the OBR. Tyrie recommended that the national statistician and the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority be scrutinised by the Treasury committee before being appointed. \u201cThe OBR\u2019s independence \u2013 since its creation in 2010 \u2013 has been similarly bolstered. That arrangement is generally considered to have been a success,\u201d Tyrie added. Bean was asked by the government to lead a review of the country\u2019s economic statistics. His interim report, published in December, found \u201cstatistics have failed to keep pace with the impact of digital technology\u201d. He also urged government departments to share their data more freely with the ONS. Appearing before Tyrie\u2019s committee in January, Bean said the nation\u2019s number crunchers \u201ccould do better\u201d, had suffered a loss of expertise when their main office was moved to Newport in Wales and that a new generation of statisticians should be more proactive in producing figures that reflect a rapidly changing economy. But the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) said it would be wrong to move responsibility for UK official statistics from the Cabinet Office to the Treasury. Reacting to Tyrie\u2019s recommendations, Mike Hughes, the chair of the RSS National Statistics Advisory Group, said: \u201cStrengthening the independence of statistics is laudable but bringing them under the purview of the Treasury would achieve the opposite perception and would be counter-productive for government. There would be the constant question of whether Treasury had influenced the figures.\u201d",

The Resolution Foundation thinktank said that 5m extra hours of work a week are needed to soak up employees\u2019 demands for more work. Moving those underemployed into longer hours would free up their part-time roles for new entrants, including those currently defined as economically inactive \u2013 many of whom have health problems or caring responsibilities. The analysis is being published before a wider-scale Resolution Foundation report later this week on how the UK can achieve the government\u2019s goal of full employment. The latest official labour market figures put unemployment at its lowest level for more than a decade at 5.1%, but employment experts highlighted signs of slack remaining, including a slowdown in wage growth and a drop in job-to-job moves. The Resolution Foundation says a key part of securing full employment will be bringing the economically inactive into employment. But doing that will require better mobility in the jobs market and an increase in hours for the underemployed - those who say they wish to work more than they are offered. The unemployed (those who class themselves as both looking for and available for work) are dwarfed in number by the economically inactive, who are either not looking or unavailable for a variety of reasons, said Laura Gardiner, a senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation. She added: \u201cMany people assume that moving towards full employment simply involves getting the unemployed into work. But the biggest potential job gains stem from bringing in the much larger group of economically inactive people. To do that we need to focus on the kind of work available, particularly for the large numbers with health problems and caring responsibilities to juggle. \u201cEncouraging people into part-time jobs lies at the heart of boosting employment. The good news is that the UK\u2019s flexible labour market provides plenty of part-time opportunities. The bad news is that far too many of those jobs are already taken by people who would prefer to work more hours elsewhere.\u201d Underemployment index Finding another 5m hours a week for the UK\u2019s underemployed workers would free up part-time roles that suit many workless people and would boost pay, particularly for younger workers, said Gardiner.

After declining dramatically during the downturn, job mobility had been rising but has recently fallen back again and remains one-third below its peak, it said. Gardiner added: \u201cThe government is right to make full employment a central target of this parliament. A good starting point for bringing more people into work is to free up roles by improving the jobs market for millions of workers who are simply stuck in the wrong job.\u201d Job-to-job moves were particularly depressed for young workers, who tend to rely on them most for pay progression and promotions early on in their careers, she said.",
