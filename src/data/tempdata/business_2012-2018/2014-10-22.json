      "bodyText": "The near collapse of the Co-operative bank blew the chance to create a full blown challenger bank to shake up the high street, according to a parliamentary report which calls for further inquiries into the roles of the bank\u2019s auditors and regulators in the scandal. Former bosses should take the biggest share of responsibility, the report said, highlighting that the structure of the board led by former chairman Paul Flowers was \u201can accident waiting to happen\u201d. The report by the Treasury select committee into the aborted attempt by Co-op bank to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group concludes that Flowers\u2019 appointment should never have been permitted by the then City regulator, the Financial Services Authority. It also rejected allegations of political meddling in the sale of the Lloyds branches \u2013 code named Verde \u2013 allegations made by Lord Levene who told the committee that interference ruined the chances of a rival offer he was fronting for bid vehicle NBNK. Co-op pulled out of its bid in April 2013 just weeks before being downgraded by Moody\u2019s and revealing it had a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall. The debacle has ended with the owner Co-operative Group left with only 20% of the bank. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the select committee, said: \u201cIt is not uncommon for deals to collapse. But in this case it was caused by the near collapse of Co-op Bank itself. Each of the backstops \u2013 Co-op Bank, KPMG as its auditor and the FSA as its regulator \u2013 failed to uncover the bank\u2019s capital shortfall until it was too late. Each had a hand in this sorry tale. But by far the biggest responsibility lies with the Co-op Bank leadership.\u201d The 127-page report sets out questions for the two investigations to come \u2013 one by the accounting watchdog the Financial Reporting Council and an independent one commissioned by the chancellor, George Osborne. Among the questions is establishing why it took so long for the bank\u2019s capital shortfall to emerge. The chancellor is yet to name who will run the independent inquiry which will begin once enforcement action by the City regulator is completed. The report questions the roles of the auditors, KPMG, asking why it took so long to uncover \u00a3500m of bad debts amassed after the merger with Britannia building society in 2009. It said the Britannia deal should not have happened and the former management of the building society should also accept \u201cresponsibility for originating the distressed assets\u201d. KMPG said the FRC was conducting an investigation and said \u201cwe believe that we have provided robust audits which challenged the judgements and disclosures proposed by the bank\u2019s management\u201d. Tyrie said: \u201cIt could turn out after closer scrutiny the auditor and regulator could and should have identified these problems before they became so severe. Nonetheless, the former management of Co-op Bank bears primary responsibility for the calamity that has befallen it.\u201d Tyrie said questions remained about whether the capital shortfall should have been uncovered sooner. \u201cThe FRC\u2019s investigation and the Treasury-commissioned inquiry into Co-op Bank need to examine this in depth,\u201d he said. The independent inquiry should \u201cform a view on whether Co-op\u2019s Verde bid could or should have been halted sooner\u201d. The committee\u2019s findings endorse those by Sir Christopher Kelly in April who also found no evidence of political interference and concluded the Britannia deal should not have gone ahead. Even so, the conclusion by the MPs on the committee that Levene\u2019s allegations could not be substantiated were seized upon by Lloyds as vindicating its assertions that it was not leant on by politicians. Whitehall sources also said the report highlighted \u201cvery poor judgement\u201d by shadow Chancellor Ed Balls who had said Osborne had questions to answer over potential political interference. Levene said he did not \u201cwish to amend my evidence\u201d which had included references to former Bank of England governor Lord King. The select committee pointed out, however, that it had not had access to the record of the government\u2019s contacts with bidders during the process, which the Chancellor would give to the independent inquiry. It also said that the collapse of Co-op\u2019s bid for the Lloyds branches \u2013 which have since been floated on the stock market as TSB \u2013 had damaged the prospects of a proper challenger bank emerging. \u201cThere is a risk that a bank of this size might struggle to grow significantly and to act as a true challenger in the market,\u201d Tyrie said. The verdicts within the report On political interference to encourage Lloyds to sell branches to Co-op \u201cThe committee has seen no evidence....that the goodwill expressed by the Government amounted to pressure.\u201d On Co-op Bank\u2019s 2009 merger with Britannia Building Society \u201cThe commercial judgment behind the decision appears questionable.\u201d On the Co-op Bank\u2019s board \u201cBy far the biggest responsibility [for the near collapse of the bank] lies with the Co-op Bank leadership.\u201d On Paul Flowers, the former chairman of the Co-op Bank \u201cMr Flowers lacked both the desirable experience and the minimum essential skills. He should not have put himself forward for the role.\u201d On the former City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority \u201cThe regulator should not have permitted [Flowers\u2019] appointment.\u201d On KPMG, the Co-op Bank\u2019s auditors \u201cThe independent inquiry into events at Co-op Bank should look closely at the shortcomings of the bank\u2019s auditor, KPMG.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The most highly qualified female business graduates lack the ambition of male counterparts in sectors such as engineering, manufacturing and natural resources, new research suggests. Some 84% of women taking management jobs in \u201ctech-intensive\u201d industries immediately after gaining a master\u2019s in business administration (MBA) aspired to a senior executive or chief executive role, compared with 97% of men, according to a global study of almost 6,000 MBA graduates by research group Catalyst. The report was released in a week when Moya Greene, chief executive of Royal Mail and one of only five female chief executives in the FTSE 100, blamed cultural and societal expectations for blunting the aspirations of many businesswomen. Greene told an event to launch the \u201c25 by 25\u201d campaign, which is targeting 25 female FTSE 100 chief executives by 2025: \u201cOne of the most important things to do is to help women take ownership of their ambition and aspirations. It\u2019s still disappointing when you see how young women view their ambition \u2013 and how others view that ambition. To be a CEO it\u2019s really hard work and you really have to want to do it. For women, even in 2014, that can be a problem.\u201d The findings suggesting that the top female business graduates lack the ambition of males in the technical sectors contradicts findings from other areas of commerce where studies frequently show that women are just as likely to aspire to the top jobs as men. Allyson Zimmermann, a senior director at Catalyst, said: \u201cA lack of role models is certainly one contributory factor. Only 15% of the women and men in business roles in technology-intensive industries had a female supervisor compared with 21% in other industries. Women were more than twice as likely as men to report a lack of role models of the same gender as a significant barrier to advancement.\u201d The research will worry campaigners for more women in top business roles, especially as it seems to echo controversial comments made in 2011 by Simon Murray, the then chairman of commodity trading group Glencore, who told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cWomen are quite as intelligent as men. They have a tendency not to be so involved quite often and they\u2019re not so ambitious in business as men because they\u2019ve got better things to do. Quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things.\u201d Up until late June, Glencore was the only FTSE 100 to maintain an all male board, when it appointed Patrice Merrin, a Canadian former mining executive, as a non-executive. The Catalyst report \u2013 which also stated that women are paid less than men in technical industries \u2013 coincided with the release of a Treasury analysis claiming a more positive picture. It said that there are more women in work in the UK than ever before and that 80% of the increase in women\u2019s employment over the past four years has been in high-skilled occupations. Nicky Morgan, the minister for women, said: \u201cWomen are making huge strides in the economy, and it\u2019s vital that their contributions are recognised. No woman should have to choose between their career and their family. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve extended the right to request flexible working and from next year will allow parents to share leave following the birth of their child.\u201d However, Catherine McKinnell MP, the shadow Treasury minister, countered: \u201cWomen are worse off after four years of David Cameron\u2019s government. The gender pay gap is widening again and House of Commons library figures show George Osborne\u2019s budget decisions have hit women a staggering four times harder than men.\u201d",

That\u2019s why we\u2019ve extended the right to request flexible working and from next year will allow parents to share leave following the birth of their child.\u201d</p> <p>However, Catherine McKinnell MP, the shadow Treasury minister, countered: \u201cWomen are worse off after four years of David Cameron\u2019s government. The gender pay gap is widening again and House of Commons library figures show George Osborne\u2019s budget decisions have hit women a staggering four times harder than men.\u201d</p>",

More than 1.13m cars rolled off production lines in British factories in the first nine months of the year. This is up 0.6% on a year earlier and the best performance over the period since 2008, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). However, car manufacturing fell 2.8% in September compared with a year earlier, with 137,068 cars made. The number was dragged down by cars built for export, which were down 8.1% at 102,947. Cars made for UK buyers however were up 17.7% at 34,121 amid thriving domestic demand for new cars. The SMMT said the drop in output in September was down to planned re-tooling of production lines as factories prepared for model changes, but the fall in exports also coincides with a renewed slowdown in the eurozone, the UK\u2019s main trading partner. \u201cThe continued investment by the sector into new models means the September figures took a slight dip as some plants underwent re-tooling but it is these same new models which will help increase production volumes in the future,\u201d said Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive.",

Horta-Os\u00f3rio is expected to blame the latest round of cuts to the 85,000-strong workforce on the move by customers towards using branches less and the internet more, meaning the bank has been forced to become more digitally focused.

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers have signalled that there will be no rise in interest rates soon amid slowing economic recovery and heightened risks from the eurozone. Minutes of the October meeting of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) showed seven members voted to leave rates unchanged at the historic low of 0.5% they fell to at the height of the financial crisis in March 2009. The committee\u2019s two dissenters, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, were looking increasingly isolated as their vote for a 0.25 point hike in rates was overruled for the third month in a row. The majority of the MPC felt the risks associated with a rate rise were too great amid signs the UK recovery was losing momentum. They also believed there was little justification for an increase with inflation below the 2% target at 1.2% and persistently weak wage growth. It argued: \u201cA premature tightening in monetary policy might leave the economy vulnerable to shocks, with the scope for any stimulus that subsequently became necessary being limited by the effective lower bound on Bank rate. \u201cWhile the economy had been growing sufficiently quickly to absorb some of the slack in the economy, there were some signs that the pace of growth was beginning to ease. The housing market appeared to be cooling with house price growth slowing to a more sustainable pace. Further downside news in the euro area had increased the risks to the durability of the UK expansion in the medium term.\u201d Economists are forecasting the first rate rise around the middle of 2015, as the arguments put forward by the majority of the MPC in October remain relevant in the coming months. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \u201cUnless pay growth shoots up in the next couple of months, a rate rise soon after the [general] election [in May 2015] now looks the most likely scenario.\u201d Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWith the eurozone\u2019s malaise unlikely to right itself quickly and inflation set to ease further over the coming months, it is hard to see what will trigger the MPC to raise interest rates over the next few months.\u201d Last week, Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist and member of the MPC, said he was gloomier about the prospects for the economy than he was a few months ago, with the implication that \u201crates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago\u201d. The October minutes revealed that Weale and McCafferty remain at odds with the majority of their colleagues, arguing the MPC should look through low inflation, just as it had previously looked through high inflation pushed up by external price pressures. They argued that although growth in the eurozone had been disappointing, the UK had not been affected by damaging financial contagion. They also believed that wage growth might pick up sharply as unemployment continues to fall. \u201cIn the judgment of these members, even after a rise of 25 basis points in Bank rate, monetary policy would remain extremely supportive, and an early rise would facilitate the committee\u2019s aspiration that any subsequent rises in Bank rate should be only gradual,\u201d the minutes said.",

      "bodyText": "Back to the Treasury Select committee, and its chair Andrew Tyrie has called Andrew Bailey\u2019s statement that he had not voted in favour of plans to ban allowances paid by banks, contrary to what the European Banking Authority said, a \u201cshocker\u201d. Tyrie said: Andrew Bailey today told the Committee that the European Banking Authority \u2018incorrectly transmitted\u2019 his views on role-based allowances last week. This looks like a shocker. We will be seeking a full explanation. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The more upbeat mood seen this week among investors continued, with European stock markets finishing the day in positive territory. Some reasonable US numbers from the likes of Yahoo and Boeing, plus weak US inflation figures which could convince the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates lower for longer, combined to lift traders\u2019s spirits. But it was not all optimistic, with talk of a number of European lenders set to fail the forthcoming EU bank stress tests. Meanwhile the ECB seemed to be playing down talk it would buy corporate bonds as part of its attempts to boost the struggling eurozone economy. Wall Street moved higher by the time Europe\u2019s traders went home but then started to slip back. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 27.4 points or 0.43% higher at 6399.73 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.6% to 8940.14 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.58% better at 4105.09 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.09% to 19,266.25 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.96% at 10,249.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 32 points or 0.2% lower. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, has told MPs that he did not vote in favour of the European Banking Authority\u2019s (EBA) proposals to ban \u201callowances\u201d, which banks started paying to executives as a top up after the bonus cap was introduced this year. My colleague Angela Monaghan was listening to the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority\u2019s appearance earlier before the Treasury Select Committee hearing and writes: Bailey said that contrary to reports from the EBA that the vote was unanimous, he was against the proposals. Confirming his vote publicly for the first time, he told the committee: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the opinion. I did not vote for the opinion. [The idea that the vote was unanimous] was incorrectly transmitted by the EBA. I was made aware because our press office was contacted [by the media] to say that they had received communication from the EBA that it was a unanimous vote. Now this was obviously a problem because as you can imagine, it would be unlikely we would vote for that. So I spoke to the EBA and said frankly I am very surprised that you have informed journalists of the vote because I thought the rules of engagement were that we didn\u2019t do that, and moreover you appear to have informed them incorrectly. I\u2019ve been in touch with [the EBA chairman] Andrea Enria. To be fair to him he said yes, that is a mistake. He told me he would correct it. We will have an EBA meeting shortly and it will be a subject for the meeting.\u201d Crude prices have edged lower after a US report showing a large rise in stocks last week. The US Energy Information Administration said inventories rose by 7.11m barrels, far more than the 2.7m increase analysts had been expecting. The report has helped push Brent crude down 0.09% to $86.14 a barrel. And surprise, surprise: Facebook paid no UK corporation tax for the second year in a row. My colleague Mark Sweeney reports: The world\u2019s largest social media company reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a311.6m in the UK last year, despite its US parent company reporting a net profit of $1.5bn (\u00a3900m). UK revenues rose from \u00a334.6m to \u00a349.8m, according to Facebook UK\u2019s latest financial filing at Companies House published on Wednesday. Facebook UK classifies its turnover as \u201cmarketing and engineering services\u201d, because much of the company\u2019s ad revenues are funnelled through Ireland to take advantage of much lower tax rates. Full story here. Stock markets were lifted in part on Tuesday by reports the European Central Bank could buy corporate bonds as part of its efforts to stimulate the flagging eurozone economy. Although the official word was that no decision had been made, investors took the idea as a positive sign anyway. But ECB member and National Bank of Austria president Ewald Nowotny is also playing down the idea (headlines from Reuters): 22-Oct-2014 15:21 - ECB\u2019S NOWOTNY SAYS CORPORATE BONDS ARE ONE OF THE MARKETS THAT ARE STILL AN OPTION TO GROW BALANCE SHEET -MNI 22-Oct-2014 15:22 - ECB\u2019S NOWOTNY SAYS THERE HAS BEEN NO DISCUSSION ON BUYING CORPORATE BONDS IN THE GOVERNING COUNCIL AND NO DECISION 22-Oct-2014 15:22 - NOWOTNY - BUYING CORPORATE BONDS WOULD HAVE EFFECT OF INCREASING BALANCE SHEET, BUT MUST LOOK FIRST AT TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES 22-Oct-2014 15:23 - NOWOTNY - MIGHT SUPPORT QE IF WE WERE TO SEE AN IMMINENT DANGER OF A LONGER-LASTING DEFLATIONARY PERSPECTIVE 22-Oct-2014 15:24 - NOWOTNY - INFLATION EXPECTATIONS REMAIN \u201cQUITE OBVIOUSLY STILL ANCHORED\u201d After recent rallies, Wall Street is fairly flat in early trading as investors pause to catch their breath after all the volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 0.54 points while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 4 points. Glaxo\u2019s restructuring plan could also involve floating part of its fast growing HIV and AIDS drugs business ViiV Healthcare. As a standalone company ViiV would be a member of the FTSE 100, with analysts at Jefferies valuing the business at around \u00a317bn. With that, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. The big news from GSK is that its Ebola vaccine should be ready by the end of the year. But market watchers are also paying close attention to the company\u2019s cost-cutting plans. After a torrid year when it has been embroiled in a bribery scandal, GSK announced it was planning to cut costs by \u00a31bn a year for the next three years as it restructures its business. CEO Andrew Witty said some products were likely to be sold off. Richard Hunter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, described the move as \u201ca shot in the arm\u201d. The spectre of patent expiries and a changing US landscape have weighed on the shares, which have dropped 15% over the last year, and 14% in the last three months alone, as compared to a 5% decline for the wider FTSE100. This puts today\u2019s share price spike* into perspective, although by the same token this could prove to be a turning point for the company. In the meantime, the market consensus of the shares as a hold may need to be positively re-evaluated. *Shares are up 3.57% The European Central Bank has poured cold water on a report from a Spanish news wire that at least 11 banks have failed financial stress tests. The ECB is due to publish the results of a financial health check for 130 institutions on Sunday. A spokesman has said that any inference about the results would be \u201chighly speculative\u201d. Spanish news wire Efe said banks from Greece, Portugal, Italy and Belgium were going to fail the tests, although it gave no details about the size of the financial holes. A banking expert from the investment firm Pimco has forecast that 18 banks will fail the stress tests. Philippe Bodereau, who manages $4.3bn of Pimco funds, said some German and Austrian co-operative and public sector banks were likely to fail the tests. It\u2019s pretty clear that not that many banks are going to fail it. A fair amount of balance sheet strengthening has taken place over the last six to nine months in anticipation of this exercise. A breakdown of how Tory MEPs voted from the Guardian\u2019s Europe editor. Alert to all UK economic regulation watchers. In just under 10 minutes, a host of senior people from the Prudential Regulation Authority will appear before the Treasury Select Committee. The witnesses include Andrew Bailey, deputy governor at the Bank of England and chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority. Although the meeting is ostensibly about the PRA\u2019s annual report and accounts, we are expecting questions on the massive glitch that saw the Bank of England\u2019s payment system out of action for several hours on Monday, causing headaches for home buyers hoping to complete transactions. More to follow... US consumer prices hardly moved last month, as falling energy prices cancelled out a slight rise in food costs. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the consumer price index inched up by just 0.1% in September. Energy prices fell 0.7%, while indices for food, alcohol and medical care increased slightly. Analysts think that low inflationary pressure will allow the US Federal Reserve to keep interest rates lower for longer. The UK\u2019s largest pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline expects that the first doses of its Ebola vaccine will be ready by the end of the year. Andrew Witty, GSK chief executive, told reporters that the GSK vaccine was likely to be the first vaccine available and would be a \u201cuseful tool\u201d for the World Health Organization and other agencies. Johnson &amp; Johnson is also working on a vaccine and has discussed collaboration with GSK. Shares in GSK are up by almost 3%, after the drugmaker announced that it planned to return \u00a34bn to shareholders. GSK\u2019s revenues were down 3% to \u00a35.6bn for the third quarter, as performance in the US and Japan dipped. We have confirmation from reporters in Strasbourg that the Conservatives abstained in today\u2019s vote on the next European Commission, led by Luxembourg\u2019s Jean-Claude Juncker. One source told Reuters that the incoming Commission president was disappointed by the Tories\u2019 abstention and believes that the Tories have reneged on a deal that resulted in a plum job for Jonathan Hill, the former lobbyist and Cameron ally. London failed to honour their part of the deal. A Conservative spokesman in the ECR group insisted there was no deal. But many of Cameron\u2019s MEPs ignored the order to abstain, according to Brussels-based journalist Dave Keating. Eurosceptic Daniel Hannan was among those voting against the Juncker Commission, while several voted in favour. The French oil company Total has chosen Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, head of its chemicals and refining business, to take over as chief executive, following the death of Christophe de Margerie in a plane crash in Russia. Thierry Desmarest, currently honorary chairman, has been nominated as executive chairman until the end of 2015. After this time, the roles of CEO and chairman will be combined again. De Margerie had done both jobs. Here is Reuters on Pouyann\u00e9 Pouyanne had a key role in merging Total\u2019s loss-making refining and petrochemical units in recent years, and also had senior roles at the group\u2019s exploration units in Angola and Qatar. A graduate of France\u2019s elite Polytechnique and Mines engineering colleges, he was also an advisor in ministerial offices under previous conservative governments. Do you know what you are having for dinner tonight? According to research cited by the Daily Telegraph, at 4pm, 3 in 4 people don\u2019t know what they will eat for their evening meal that night. And that is the kind of question that keeps awake the bosses of the UKs\u2019 big supermarkets, as they contemplate massive changes sweeping through the industry. The Telegraph has an interview with Mark Price, the chief executive of Waitrose, who argues that his big four competitors - Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons - are twenty years out of date. This is because the weekly shop is over - a more important trend than the rise of the discounters, he says. People are buying food for now... The notion that you are going to go and push a trolley around for the week is a thing of the past. It is fundamentally changing the market. All these trends are effectively pulling people out of big box, out-of-town retailing. That is really the challenge that the \u2018big four\u2019 are facing. They have an estate for how people shopped two decades ago. This is a once in 50 to 60 year change. The last big change was the supermarket [in the 1950s]. I think what you are seeing now is as fundamental. All interesting reading ahead of Tesco\u2019s interim results tomorrow... The European Parliament has backed the incoming European Commission headed by Jean-Claude Juncker. No big surprise there, and it appears the Commission had a healthy majority, with 423 votes of the 699 MEPs voting in favour. This voting picture comes from the chief of staff to Pierre Moscovici, the former French finance minister, who will take charge of the EU\u2019s economic affairs. So now it is official. Juncker and his team start work on 1 November. From the man himself... One day after a plane crash that saw the boss of Total and three crew members killed by a drunk driver at a Russian airport, the French oil company is moving fast to fill the gap at the top. According to the French business daily Les Echoes, the board of the oil company is meeting today and will consider splitting the functions of chairman and chief executive, which were both held by Christophe de Margerie, who died in the plane crash. Thierry Desmarest, currently honorary chairman, will become executive chairman, while Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, president of refining and chemicals, is to be appointed director-general. If this plan is approved, shareholders will vote on the appointment of Pouyann\u00e9, who is not currently a member of the board. Total declined to comment on the story. Over in Strasbourg, the European Parliament is preparing to vote for the new European Commission, headed by ex-Luxembourg prime minister and eurozone bigwig Jean-Claude Juncker. Juncker and his 28-strong team take office on 1 November. This morning he outlined his priorities to MEPs, promising a \u20ac300bn plan to boost jobs and growth, although much of this is to come from private investors, not governments. The vote is now largely a formality and the Parliament is expected to back Juncker\u2019s team with a big majority. Curiously, we are getting some reports from Twitter that the ECR group, which includes the UK\u2019s Conservatives, plans to abstain from the vote. This would mean Tory MEPs failing to back the UK\u2019s choice for European commissioner, Lord Hill, the former lobbyist handpicked by David Cameron for the job. So, just another day for the Conservative party and its confused relations with the rest of Europe. After this morning\u2019s BoE minutes showed a majority of MPC members are in favour of keeping rates on hold, analysts are not expecting change any time soon. Market watchers think rates could be stuck at their current historic low of 0.5% well into 2015, or even into 2016. Alex Edwards at UK Forex thinks if the economy continues down its current path, the first rate hike may not happen until early 2016. The Bank of England monetary policy meeting minutes painted a fairly bleak picture this morning, suggesting that weaker growth and low in inflation in the eurozone has increased risks to the UK. Also, with average earnings still struggle to keep pace with the low level of inflation a rate hike wasn\u2019t justified. Although two members did vote for a rate hike, the bank is a lot more dovish now. Jeremy Cook at World First foreign exchange company, agrees that slowing momentum in the international and global economy means low rates will continue. Pressures on the UK economy from the Eurozone and China were the main concerns of the Bank of England, but alongside recent falls in inflation and wage growth, the market seems justified in shifting its expectations of when the Bank of England will look to start normalising monetary policy. Momentum within and without the UK economy has slowed; we have seen slowing growth in China, the US, the Eurozone and likely the UK this Friday. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, is forecasting a rate rise in mid 2015, after the general election. He suggests that some of the recent pessimism may be overdone. We expect only a mild UK slowdown, although a little sharper than the BoE is banking on. Manufacturing is suffering from stalled Eurozone growth, but there are no signs of the wider contagion to the UK that came in 2011/12. Moreover, the disastrous August German data were exaggerated by holiday timing. If the downside risks do not materialise and Eurozone growth resumes early next year, which is our base case, then the gloom now will give way to a rosier growth outlook next year. Indeed, that outlook would then be boosted by cheaper food and energy prices. We look for the BoE to begin hiking in June next year, after the uncertainty around the general election has passed. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, has downgraded his forecasts. He and his team expect rates to rise to 1% by late 2015 and to 2% by the end of 2016. We have recently put back our expectation of the first interest rate hike from February to mid-2015. We suspect that the majority of MPC members will prefer to err on the side of caution in raising interest rates \u2013 given increased global growth concerns (particularly the weakness in the Eurozone) posing an increased downside risk to the UK growth outlook, earnings growth still weak and consumer price inflation down to 1.2% in September and likely to go lower still in the near term given the weakness of oil prices. Following the publication of the minutes, the pound has dropped 0.5% against the dollar to $1.603. The Bank\u2019s minutes also provide interesting reading on the state of the international economy, especially the eurozone. Here are a few highlights: The recent loss of momentum in the eurozone was \u201cespecially notable\u201d in Germany, whose export-orientated economy makes it more vulnerable than many other countries to shifts in global demand. Sanctions imposed on Russia and weakness in the Russian economy are likely to have a \u201climited\u201d effect on Germany, although it has had a bigger impact on German business confidence. The news from emerging economies was \u201ca little to the downside\u201d, with slowing growth in Chinese industrial production expected to weaken overall economic numbers. The Bank said it was unclear how the outlook would be affected by political unrest in Hong Kong. In other emerging economies, tighter monetary policy since the start of the year has weighed on the growth outlook. The United States has shown a more positive story, but the Bank thinks that the recent pace of expansion may not continue. Lower oil prices appeared to reflect subdued global demand and rising supply. But the the upward-sloping oil price futures curve was consistent with some of the weakness in oil prices expected to be temporary. The Bank of England minutes refer to the last MPC meeting held on 7 &amp; 8 October The majority view Most members of the rate-setting committee said there was not enough evidence of inflationary pressure to justify raising interest rates. They highlighted falling labour costs, weak pay growth and signs that economic growth is beginning to slow down. For these members, there remained few signs of inflationary pressure in the UK economy, even after looking through the effects of a stronger sterling exchange rate. In particular, unit labour costs had fallen over the past year. Pay growth, which was likely to remain subdued in the public sector, was lower than was consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. Household inflation expectations had fallen a little, although they continued to be well anchored to the inflation target. While the economy had been growing sufficiently quickly to absorb some of the slack in the economy, there were some signs that the pace of growth was beginning to ease. The housing market appeared to be cooling with house price growth slowing to a more sustainable pace. Further downside news in the euro area had increased the risks to the durability of the UK expansion in the The minority view But two of the bank\u2019s external members wanted to raise rates to 0.75%, arguing that keeping rates too low for too long would unbalance the recovery. While growth in the euro-area economy had been disappointing, so far, in contrast to 2011, the United Kingdom had not been affected by damaging financial contagion. The continued fall in the unemployment rate was consistent with the rapid absorption of slack and, even if the rate at which unemployment was falling were to ease markedly, it would nonetheless reach its estimated medium-term equilibrium level by the middle of 2015. Survey evidence of tightening in the labour market, including from the Bank\u2019s Agents, suggested that wage growth might pick up quite sharply as slack was absorbed. Since monetary policy could be expected to operate only with a lag, it was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank Rate in advance of them. It was possible that the real rate of interest consistent with stable inflation over the medium term was now rising. Key information from the Bank of England minutes available here Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, two external members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, voted to raise rates, but were outvoted by the other seven members of the committee; Most MPC members felt that raising rates would leave the UK vulnerable to shocks in the global economy; The MPC said \u201cfurther downside news in the euro area had increased risks to Britain\u2019s economy\u201d. The Bank voted 9.0 to maintain current levels of financial stimulus at \u00a3375bn. The Bank of England voted 7:2 last month in favour of keeping interest rates at 0.5%, according to minutes just published. Retail analyst Nick Bubb has some interesting thoughts on the arrival of Euan Sutherland at SuperGroup, which puts Julian Dunkerton, the chief executive who launched the company, in a new role. Today\u2019s unexpected news that Euan Sutherland is to replace Julian Dunkerton as the CEO of SuperGroup, with immediate effect, isn\u2019t quite as outlandish as it seems because he has been a non-exec there for nearly 2 years, so he knows what he\u2019s letting himself in for. But it\u2019s certainly going to be very different from running the Co-op or B&amp;Q and he will be hoping that \u201cJules\u201d isn\u2019t too much of a backseat driver, in his new role as \u201cFounder and Product and Brand Director\u201d. After a difficult autumn season to date, the next scheduled news from SuperGroup is the Q2 trading update on November 6th and then the interim results on December 11th. Heineken, the world\u2019s third largest beer maker, has been hit by lower than expected sales as Europeans drank less during a wet summer. The brewer, which also makes Sol, Amstel and Strongbow cider, as well as the namesake beer, said global beer sales were hardly changed over July- September, reflecting a slump in sales in Europe. Sales, measured by beer volume, were down by 4.7% in western Europe and 6.6% in central and eastern Europe. In eastern Europe, the company blamed poor weather, as well as the weakening economy in Russia, but sales also dropped in the UK, France and the Netherlands. But for the company\u2019s management, the glass is half full, as it still expects to meet its financial forecasts. Retail analyst Jonathan De Mello thinks Home Retail Group have made the right decision to close Homebase stores, but asks if they could develop a click and collect business. From banking to fashion: here is our story on the former boss of Coop, Euan Sutherland, who is taking over as the boss of SuperGroup, the company behind the shop Superdry. Ex-Co-op chief takes over at Superdry Nobody saw that coming, as the editor of Retail Week points out. Is Homebase closing stores because people simply aren\u2019t any good at changing washers and building garden sheds? Or perhaps, they don\u2019t want to do it themselves? In Home Retail Group\u2019s statement to the City the company appears to suggest as much (my emphasis). Homebase competes in several segments of the broader home improvement market, including Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and home enhancement. As a result of several economic factors, the home improvement market experienced a cyclical downturn for a number of years through to 2012. Although economic indicators have more recently improved, several structural factors continue to affect home improvement retailing including an excess of retail space, the rise of a generation less skilled in DIY projects, and the growth of non-traditional digital and multi-channel competitors and category specialists. Homebase will close 25% of its stores by 2018 citing \u201cinconsistent store operating standards\u201d and \u201ca large estate with low sales densities that result in a challenged financial model\u201d. Meanwhile on a call with journalists, the boss of the Home Retail Group says he is committed to keeping the Homebase DIY chain. The main European share indices have risen modestly in early trading, although the FTSE100 is flat. France\u2019s CAC +0.18% Germany\u2019s DAX +0.6% FTSEurofirst 300 +0.07% Shares in Home Retail Group have fallen by more than 5%, after the company said it was closing almost a quarter of its Homebase stores. Big news in the UK retail world this morning. Home Retail Group has announced it will close around a quarter of Homebase DIY stores over the next three years. Like other big retail outfits, the group has too many big out-of-town stores that aren\u2019t making enough money as consumers buy more over the internet. More to follow.... \u2018Interest rates will not rise before the election\u2019. This has been the consensus among economists for several weeks, even before the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane said that he felt gloomier about the prospects for the UK economy. Last month we found out that two members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee voted to raise rates. Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, both external members of the committee, called for rates to rise to 0.75% in response to lower unemployment and a tightening labour market, but were outvoted by the seven other members of the committee. Since then the prospects of a rate rise ahead of May\u2019s general election have diminished even further, as a result of falling inflation, rising oil prices and concern about the stagnant outlook for the eurozone. Capital Economics expects a repeat of last month\u2019s 7:2 split. The rapid easing of present and pipeline price pressures will surely have convinced the seven members of the MPC who voted to keep rates on hold last month to maintain their votes. While the figures were released after its meeting, the MPC would have known that CPI inflation fell to just 1.2% in September \u2013 well below its 1.7% forecast in August\u2019s Inflation Report. And the sharp fall in oil prices, from \u00a3100pb at September\u2019s meeting to just $88pb at October\u2019s, has left CPI inflation on track to dip below 1% later this year \u2013 a rate that would force Mr. Carney to reach for his letter-writing pen. The governor of the Bank of England has to write to the chancellor, George Osborne, if the banks misses its statutory target of 2% for consumer prices, by a percentage point on either side. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Asian shares have risen after healthy gains on US markets and positive Japanese trade data. Tokyo\u2019s benchmark Nikkei index closed up 2.64%. European markets are expected to rally today, after reports that that the European Central Bank is looking at boosting its stimulus measures. Reuters reported that the bank is considering buying corporate bonds on the secondary market and could begin purchases as soon as next year. An ECB spokesman said no decision had been taken, but analysts expect investors will be enthusiastic. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets writes While ECB officials have denied that any move is imminent the nature of the speculation is so ECB, using unnamed sources to plant an idea in the markets consciousness and then let it germinate on fertile ground so that investors can grasp at straws and help push asset prices higher. On our agenda, important reading on interest rates later this morning. We will learn more about the views of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee, when we get the minutes of their latest meeting (7-8 October). On the corporate side, we have results from GSK, Home Retail and Spirit pub group to crunch through. And Euan Sutherland, the former boss of Co-op, is taking over as the boss of SuperGroup.",

Some reasonable US numbers from the likes of Yahoo and Boeing, plus weak US inflation figures which could convince the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates lower for longer, combined to lift traders\u2019s spirits. But it was not all optimistic, with talk of a number of European lenders set to fail the forthcoming EU bank stress tests. Meanwhile the ECB seemed to be playing down talk it would buy corporate bonds as part of its attempts to boost the struggling eurozone economy.

Also, with average earnings still struggle to keep pace with the low level of inflation a rate hike wasn\u2019t justified. Although two members did vote for a rate hike, the bank is a lot more dovish now. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook at World First foreign exchange company, </strong>agrees that slowing momentum in the international and global economy means low rates will continue.<strong> </strong></p> <blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Pressures on the UK economy from the Eurozone and China were the main concerns of the Bank of England, but alongside recent falls in inflation and wage growth, the market seems justified in shifting its expectations of when the Bank of England will look to start normalising monetary policy.</p> <p> Momentum within and without the UK economy has slowed; we have seen slowing growth in China, the US, the Eurozone and likely the UK this Friday.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p><strong>Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg</strong>, is forecasting a rate rise in mid 2015, after the general election. He suggests that some of the recent pessimism may be overdone.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect only a mild UK slowdown, although a little sharper than the BoE is banking on. Manufacturing is suffering from stalled Eurozone growth, but there are no signs of the wider contagion to the UK that came in 2011/12. Moreover, the disastrous August German data were exaggerated by holiday timing. If the downside risks do not materialise and Eurozone growth resumes early next year, which is our base case, then the gloom now will give way to a rosier growth outlook next year. Indeed, that outlook would then be boosted by cheaper food and energy prices. We look for the BoE to begin hiking in June next year, after the uncertainty around the general election has passed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight</strong>, has downgraded his forecasts.

The continued fall in the unemployment rate was consistent with the rapid absorption of slack and, even if the rate at which unemployment was falling were to ease markedly, it would nonetheless reach its estimated medium-term equilibrium level by the middle of 2015. Survey evidence of tightening in the labour market, including from the Bank\u2019s Agents, suggested that wage growth might pick up quite sharply as slack was absorbed. Since monetary policy could be expected to operate only with a lag, it was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank Rate in advance of them. It was possible that the real rate of interest consistent with stable inflation over the medium term was now rising. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong><br></strong><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-22T09:44:18.632Z\">at 10.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54476bf1e4b0bab1d5d31fa7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-22T08:36:45.847Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Key information from the Bank of England minutes available <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Pages/mpc/default.aspx\">here</a></p> <ul> <li>Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, two external members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, voted to raise rates, but were outvoted by the other seven members of the committee;</li> <li>Most MPC members felt that raising rates would leave the UK vulnerable to shocks in the global economy;</li> <li>The MPC said \u201cfurther downside news in the euro area had increased risks to Britain\u2019s economy\u201d.</li> <li>The Bank voted 9.0 to maintain current levels of financial stimulus at \u00a3375bn.<br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-22T08:42:44.313Z\">at 9.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54476bb4e4b0cd82a096001e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-22T08:32:53.736Z\">9.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of England voted 7:2 to keep rates on hold</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Bank of England voted 7:2 last month in favour of keeping interest rates at 0.5%, according to minutes just published.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-22T09:42:59.338Z\">at 10.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-544767f4e4b0cd82a096001b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-22T08:20:05.084Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Retail analyst Nick Bubb </strong>has some interesting thoughts on the arrival of Euan Sutherland at SuperGroup, which puts Julian Dunkerton, the chief executive who launched the company, in a new role.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Today\u2019s unexpected news that Euan Sutherland is to replace Julian Dunkerton as the CEO of SuperGroup, with immediate effect, isn\u2019t quite as outlandish as it seems because he has been a non-exec there for nearly 2 years, so he knows what he\u2019s letting himself in for.

This has been the consensus among economists for several weeks, even before the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/17/bank-england-chief-economist-gloomier-interest-rates-andrew-haldane\">he felt gloomier about the prospects for the UK economy</a>. </p> <p>Last month we found out that two members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee voted to raise rates.<strong> Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty</strong>, both external members of the committee, called for rates to rise to 0.75% in response to lower unemployment and a tightening labour market, but were outvoted by the seven other members of the committee. </p> <p>Since then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/19/decision-interest-rates-held-between-agony-ecstasy\">the prospects of a rate rise ahead of May\u2019s general election have diminished even further</a>, as a result of falling inflation, rising oil prices and concern about the stagnant outlook for the eurozone.</p> <p><strong>Capital Economics</strong> expects a repeat of last month\u2019s 7:2 split.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rapid easing of present and pipeline price pressures will surely have convinced the seven members of the MPC who voted to keep rates on hold last month to maintain their votes. <br></p> <p>While the figures were released after its meeting, the MPC would have known that CPI inflation fell to just 1.2% in September \u2013 well below its 1.7% forecast in August\u2019s Inflation Report. And the sharp fall in oil prices, from \u00a3100pb at September\u2019s meeting to just $88pb at October\u2019s, has left CPI inflation on track to dip below 1% later this year \u2013 a rate that would force Mr. Carney to reach for his letter-writing pen. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>The governor of the Bank of England has to write to the chancellor, George Osborne, if the banks misses its statutory target of 2% for consumer prices, by a percentage point on either side.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54474b7ce4b0bab1d5d31f98\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-22T06:47:07.238Z\">7.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world.</strong></p> <p>Asian shares have risen after healthy gains on US markets and positive Japanese trade data.

Deposits rose by \u00a3350m during the quarter to \u00a32.34bn and also more than doubled from a year earlier. Deposits from business customers were 60% of the total. Customer accounts rose by 71% from a year ago to 406,000. However, after four years of trading, the venture continued to lose money, recording a loss of \u00a39.4m.

Metro was one of the first banks to announce it would take on the established lenders, whose reputations were damaged in the financial crisis and a string of mis-selling scandals.

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers remained split over whether to raise interest rates immediately, with two members of the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) voting in favour this month. Minutes of the October meeting of the MPC revealed that dissenters Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty voted for a 0.25 percentage-point rise to 0.75% for a third successive month. The remaining seven members, however, including the Bank governor, Mark Carney, voted to leave rates unchanged at 0.5%, where they have been since March 2009, at the height of the financial crisis. For the majority of the committee, low inflation of 1.2%, weak pay growth, signs that the recovery was losing momentum, and increased risks to the UK economy posed by the eurozone justified leaving rates on hold. They argued: \u201cA premature tightening in monetary policy might leave the economy vulnerable to shocks, with the scope for any stimulus that subsequently became necessary being limited by the effective lower bound on Bank rate.\u201d Weale and McCafferty, however, argued that the MPC should look past low inflation, just as it had previously looked past high inflation pushed up by external price pressures. They argued that though growth in the eurozone had been \u201cdisappointing\u201d, the UK had not been affected by damaging financial contagion. They also believed that wage growth might rise sharply as unemployment continues to fall. \u201cIn the judgment of these members, even after a rise of 25 basis points in Bank rate, monetary policy would remain extremely supportive, and an early rise would facilitate the committee\u2019s aspiration that any subsequent rises in Bank rate should be only gradual,\u201d the minutes revealed. Despite their arguments, financial markets have pushed their expectations of a first rate rise to the third quarter of 2015, from earlier expectations of a rise in spring. Economists said the arguments put forward by the majority of the MPC would remain relevant in the coming months, leaving Weale and McCafferty increasingly isolated. Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWith the eurozone\u2019s malaise unlikely to right itself quickly and inflation set to ease further over the coming months, it is hard to see what will trigger the MPC to raise interest rates over the next few months. \u201cAccordingly, while we maintain our view that Bank rate is likely to rise to only 1% by the end of next year, we now think that May, rather than February, is the most likely date for the first hike.\u201d",
