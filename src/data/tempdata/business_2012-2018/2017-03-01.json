      "bodyText": "President Donald Trump has helped drive up stock markets on Wall Street and in London to new highs, after he promised corporate tax cuts and a spending splurge on infrastructure projects to boost the economy. The Dow Jones index, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq index of technology stocks reached fresh highs on Wednesday, while the FTSE in London also hit a new record. The Dow Jones surpassed 21,000 for the first time to reach 21,130, while FTSE 100 jumped almost 120 points to 7,382 on the day and more than 1,100 points higher \u2013 or 18% \u2013 on the same month a year ago. Exchanges in Spain, Germany and France also saw steep rises in the value of listed shares as investors bet on a spending spree by the new Trump administration filtering out to increase the profits of large corporations across Europe. In his most measured speech to date, Trump told Congress he would bring back to life dying industries and \u201ccrumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land\u201d. He added: \u201cMy economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.\u201d The dollar jumped to a seven-week high on the expectations of a fresh stimulus from Washington and news that the US manufacturing sector maintained its recent strong run of expansion, pushing the pound down more than a cent to $1.23. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB said Trump\u2019s speech was the main trigger for the strong rally on Wall Street and especially his \u201ccommitment to tax reform and $1 trillion [\u00a3810bn] of infrastructure spending\u201d. But Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said figures showing the underlying strength of the US economy provided the markets with most of their momentum. He said US savers had huge sums of cash, but had been waiting for good news from the economy before investing. \u201cPeople have been holding off and a lot of cash has been sitting on the sidelines. Now that cash is being put to work and pushing the market up,\u201d he said. Banking stocks were among the biggest risers alongside defence contractors and firms in a position to benefit from rising infrastructure spending, like the construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar, which has seen a near-60% rise in its share price over the last year. The UK banking index rose 1.6% as Standard Chartered, HSBC and Barclays gained between 1.5% and 2.3%. Miners helped the FTSE 100 as copper climbed to its highest level in nearly a week, on concerns about a shortage of supply and an upturn in manufacturing growth in top metals user China. Prices of other major metals such as aluminium, nickel and zinc were also higher. The strength of the US economy also raised the prospect of an early interest rate rise, possibly following the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting later this month. New York Fed president, William Dudley, an influential figure on the central bank\u2019s open market committee and close ally of chair, Janet Yellen, said the case for tightening monetary policy \u201chas become a lot more compelling\u201d. \u201cIn fact, prospects of significant fiscal spending could push more Fed members to the hawkish camp,\u201d said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, adding that traders were in a hurry to readjust Fed expectations.",

Range Rovers are Britain\u2019s largest luxury export, according to the carmaker, accounting for 85% of all luxury cars built in the UK and contributing \u00a310bn a year to the economy. Ralf Speth, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said: \u201cThe expansion of our product range and building this British-designed and engineered car in the UK is a sign of our confidence in British manufacturing. \u201cWe are leading the global premium car industry with our commitment to our home market, and our heart, soul and headquarters will always be in the UK.\u201d The UK car industry backed the remain campaign in last year\u2019s EU referendum, and has since warned that British manufacturing is at risk of \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d if companies choose to invest in other countries after the Brexit vote. Japanese carmaker Nissan announced in October it would go ahead and build the next Qashqai and X-Trail models at its Sunderland factory.

The starting price will be \u00a345,000 in the UK, positioning it between the Evoque \u2013 the least expensive Range Rover \u2013 and the Range Rover Sport. It is the third model in two years to be launched at the West Midlands plant. The decision follows a \u00a31.5bn investment in new facilities and technologies at the Solihull factory, where about 10,000 people are employed. JLR, owned by India\u2019s Tata, said it directly supports more than 40,000 British jobs at manufacturing plants and a further 250,000 in the supply chain.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 1,400 UK jobs are at risk as pharmacy chain Boots, Walkers crisps and bakery Greggs all cut costs. Both Walkers and Greggs are restructuring their manufacturing operations in an attempt to improve efficiency. The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers\u2019 Union said more than 600 jobs were at risk at nine Greggs bakeries around the UK. Walkers, which is owned by US food and drink group PepsiCo, is planning to close its manufacturing plant in Peterlee, County Durham, by the end of the year, which will affect 355 manufacturing jobs and a further 25 in transport. Boots is shutting more than two-thirds of its photo processing laboratories as demand for traditional photo processing falls, putting up to 400 jobs at risk. Greggs is closing a facility in Norwich and increasing automation at its remaining eight bakeries in England, Wales and Scotland. The company said it was moving from a system in which all the factories made a mix of foods towards specialisation that would make it more efficient and help offset rising costs. Its Treforest site in Wales will only make bread and sandwiches, and will stop making doughnuts, while its Cambuslang facility near Glasgow will concentrate on sweet goods. Consultation with affected workers began last month and the company said it was offering voluntary redundancy in order to \u201cminimise the impact\u201d of its plans. The cuts, which will happen over the next two years, are part of a \u00a3100m restructuring of Greggs\u2019 manufacturing business that began last year. The move has already led to the loss of 355 manufacturing jobs after the closure of bakeries in Twickenham, Edinburgh and Sleaford. The company would not confirm the overall number of jobs at risk within its manufacturing operations but said it would be creating about a1,000 jobs annually as it planned to open about 100 more stores each year. \u201cIn March 2016 we announced a \u00a3100m investment programme in our supply chain over a five-year period which will reshape the business and enable us to grow to substantially more than 2,000 shops,\u201d a spokesperson said. Walkers said 80% of the Peterlee factory\u2019s output was shipped to customers south of the local area, incurring significant transport costs. Tracey Foster, Peterlee manufacturing director at PepsiCo UK, said: \u201cPeterlee has been an important site for our business but the changes we are proposing present significant productivity and efficiency savings crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainable growth of our business in the UK.\u201d Both Greggs and Walkers denied the cost savings were linked to rising costs linked to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Roger Whiteside, chief executive of Greggs, said the changes were part of a strategic plan that had been put in place more than a year ago when costs were falling. But he did acknowledge the changes would help offset rising costs resulting from the introduction of the new minimum wage for over-25s, the apprenticeship levy and increases in commodities such as dairy goods and meat. Boots plans to close 220 of its 320 photo labs. Consultation with affected staff began on Wednesday and is expected to be completed in the summer. Photo lab staff will be offered retraining and redeployment to other roles where possible, but some roles may be made redundant. Boots said: \u201cOver the past few years, customers\u2019 expectations of photo services have continued to change as they print fewer pictures but want to create more personalised photo gifts and items such as personalised photobooks, canvases and cards. As a result of these changing behaviours, Boots UK is adapting how it delivers photo services in store.\u201d While there is now little demand for traditional film processing, there is growth in printing photos from digital cameras or smartphones, according to industry insiders, and strong demand for personalised gifts using photos. But Boots is facing greater competition in that market from the likes of online specialists Photobox and Moonpig. Timpson Group, the shoe-mending company, is also expanding into photo gifts and processing. The company, which owns Snappy Snaps and bought Tesco\u2019s photo processing business in 2014 (it now operates under the Max Spielmann brand), opened 10 more photo outlets last year. Boots said customers who no longer had access to a photo lab in their local store would be able to send films away for developing at its head office in Nottingham, which also produces photo-based gifts. It will also still be possible to print photographs directly from phones, tablet computers or USB sticks at 3,000 automated kiosks across 1,000 Boots stores.",

The move has already led to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/greggs-says-healthier-options-boosted-sales\">the loss of 355 manufacturing jobs</a> after the closure of bakeries in Twickenham, Edinburgh and Sleaford.</p> <p>The company would not confirm the overall number of jobs at risk within its manufacturing operations but said it would be creating about a1,000 jobs annually as it planned to open about 100 more stores each year.</p> <p>\u201cIn March 2016 we announced a \u00a3100m investment programme in our supply chain over a five-year period which will reshape the business and enable us to grow to substantially more than 2,000 shops,\u201d a spokesperson said. </p> <p>Walkers said 80% of the Peterlee factory\u2019s output was shipped to customers south of the local area, incurring significant transport costs.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Tracey Foster, Peterlee manufacturing director at PepsiCo UK, said: \u201cPeterlee has been an important site for our business but the changes we are proposing present significant productivity and efficiency savings crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainable growth of our business in the UK.\u201d </p> <p>Both Greggs and Walkers denied the cost savings were linked to rising costs linked to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Roger Whiteside, chief executive of Greggs, said the changes were part of a strategic plan that had been put in place more than a year ago when costs were falling. </p> <p>But he did acknowledge the changes would help offset rising costs resulting from the introduction of the new minimum wage for over-25s, the apprenticeship levy and increases in commodities such as dairy goods and meat.</p> <p>Boots plans to close 220 of its 320 photo labs.</p> <p>Consultation with affected staff began on Wednesday and is expected to be completed in the summer. Photo lab staff will be offered retraining and redeployment to other roles where possible, but some roles may be made redundant.</p> <p>Boots said: \u201cOver the past few years, customers\u2019 expectations of photo services have continued to change as they print fewer pictures but want to create more personalised photo gifts and items such as personalised photobooks, canvases and cards. As a result of these changing behaviours, Boots UK is adapting how it delivers photo services in store.\u201d</p> <p>While there is now little demand for traditional film processing, there is growth in printing photos from digital cameras or smartphones, according to industry insiders, and strong demand for personalised gifts using photos.</p> <p>But Boots is facing greater competition in that market from the likes of online specialists Photobox and Moonpig.</p> <p>Timpson Group, the shoe-mending company, is also expanding into photo gifts and processing. The company, which owns Snappy Snaps and bought Tesco\u2019s photo processing business in 2014 (it now operates under the Max Spielmann brand), opened 10 more photo outlets last year. </p> <p>Boots said customers who no longer had access to a photo lab in their local store would be able to send films away for developing at its head office in Nottingham, which also produces photo-based gifts.</p> <p>It will also still be possible to print photographs directly from phones, tablet computers or USB sticks at 3,000 automated kiosks across 1,000 Boots stores.</p> <p></p> <p></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, the last owner of BHS, has pledged to fight legal action by the Pensions Regulator designed to force him to pay millions of pounds into the failed retailer\u2019s pension scheme, saying the black hole in the scheme was not his fault. The regulator has agreed a \u00a3363m cash settlement with Sir Philip Green to rescue the BHS pension scheme and halted legal proceedings against the billionaire. However, it is continuing with legal action against Chappell and his company Retail Acquisitions and is understood to be seeking as much as \u00a317m. Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience, for just \u00a31 in March 2015. Retail Acquisitions (RAL) received payments of up to \u00a325m from BHS despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed. A spokesman for Retail Acquisitions said: \u201cAny action brought by the Pensions Regulator will be robustly defended because RAL did not cause or add to the pension deficit, that shortfall was built up during the previous ownership.\u201d The failure of BHS led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. A high-profile parliamentary investigation into its demise concluded that the company had been systematically plundered by its owners and accused Chappell of having \u201chis fingers in the till\u201d. The Retail Acquisitions spokesman said: \u201cDominic Chappell is currently working very hard with the liquidator to recover and preserve nearly \u00a350m, which will benefit the creditors and BHS pensioners.\u201d The ongoing enforcement action by the Pensions Regulator shows the settlement with Green is not the end of one of the biggest corporate scandals in Britain. The collapse of BHS is still being investigated by the Insolvency Service which could recommend that former directors of BHS are banned from being company directors in Britain. The Financial Reporting Council is also looking into the collapse, while the Serious Fraud Office is also considering whether to launch a formal investigation. The deal between Green and the Pensions Regulator has received a mixed reception. Although the settlement is endorsed by the trustees of the BHS pension scheme, workers are still very likely to have cuts to their pension benefits. The Pensions Regulator estimates that workers will on average receive about 88% of the value of their original benefits in a new pension scheme created by the settlement. This is a better outcome than if the scheme had entered the Pension Protection Fund, a lifeboat for failed pension schemes, where workers would have received an estimated 75% to 79%. Green initially pledged to \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme last June when he was questioned by MPs. He has already paid more than \u00a3343m into an escrow account as part of the settlement. An additional \u00a320m will be spent on expenses and implementing the changes to the BHS pension scheme.",

      "bodyText": "Police claimed they had \u201cauthorization from the president of McDonald\u2019s\u201d to arrest protesting fast food workers, according to a civil rights lawsuit filed on Wednesday against the city of Memphis, Tennessee. The suit alleges that local police engaged in a \u201cwidespread and illegal campaign of surveillance and intimidation\u201d against a local chapter of the Fight for $15 fast-food worker organization as it campaigned for an increase in the minimum wage and union rights for fast food workers. Officers followed organizers home after meetings, ordered workers not to sign petitions and blacklisted organizers from city hall, according to the suit. They claimed to have been authorized by McDonald\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest fast food chain, and in one incident a McDonald\u2019s franchisee joined police in tailing protesters. The suit alleges that a campaign of harassment began after Memphis workers participated in a nationwide day of protest on 4 September 2014. Since then, police officers have repeatedly threatened workers with arrest during protests, at one point telling them they had \u201cauthorization from the president of McDonald\u2019s to make arrests\u201d. On \u201cmultiple occasions\u201d officers \u201cseemed to take direction from McDonald\u2019s\u201d, the complaint charges. Last November, police officers stepped behind the counter of a fast-food restaurant to prevent workers from signing petitions calling for better working conditions, the protesters\u2019 lawyers claim. They also allege that officers have enforced local permit laws on the predominantly black workers in the Fight for $15, while allowing protests by mostly white crowds to continue unabated. The suit, brought against the city, Mayor James Strickland and the police director, Michael Rallings, alleges that the police have violated a 1978 consent decree that banned political surveillance following revelations the department had spied on civil rights activists, war protesters and other \u201cradicals\u201d for years. McDonald\u2019s was not immediately available for comment. The Memphis mayor\u2019s office declined to comment on \u201cpending litigation\u201d. The suit, filed in US district court for the western district Tennessee by the Fight for $15 mid-south organizing committee, alleges the Memphis police department [MPD] engaged in \u201cimproper and illegal surveillance tactics aimed at having a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and the right to assemble or associate\u201d. In February, Fight for $15 held a \u201cteach-in\u201d about Andy Puzder, the fast-food CEO who was, at the time, Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be labor secretary. According to the complaint, four unmarked cars and a patrol car showed up outside the teach-in and followed an organizer at the meeting\u2019s conclusion. When an organizer asked one of the officers why he was being followed, the officer replied: \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make sure everyone stays safe.\u201d Jerry Martin, an attorney for the mid-south organizing committee, said: \u201cThe MPD is engaging in an intentional and illegal campaign to intimidate workers in an effort to prevent them from exercising their constitutional right to speak out ... We\u2019ve read about such behavior in history books, but unfortunately, in Memphis, intimidation and harassment of protesters is not just a thing of the past.\u201d Ashley Cathey, a Church\u2019s Chicken worker and member of the Fight for $15 national organizing committee, said: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to stop us from speaking out, but even though it\u2019s riskier, we know we have a right to protest and we\u2019re not going to be intimidated ...

      "bodyText": "Len McCluskey, the head of the UK\u2019s biggest trade union has urged Theresa May to guarantee car makers tariff-free access to the single market after Brexit, as Ford unveiled plans to cut 1,160 jobs over five years at its engine factory in Bridgend, Wales. McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, also demanded that Ford provide \u201clegally binding guarantees\u201d of future production at the plant, saying that workers had been \u201ckept in the dark\u201d. The US car firm, which has warned it could slash costs due to Brexit, said it was cutting jobs because it expected demand for the petrol engines made at Bridgend to fall after 2018. Ford\u2019s forecast of waning demand for the petrol engines it makes at Bridgend are understood to be linked to the rise of electric vehicles. The engines are also mostly used in larger cars, which the company believes are becoming less popular as customers opt for smaller, more fuel-efficient models. Ford said it could \u201cfully understand\u201d workers\u2019 concerns about the future of the Bridgend plant. But McCluskey said the union would \u201cuse all its might\u201d to protect jobs, blaming Ford\u2019s decision on uncertainty surrounding the terms of Brexit. \u201cWe will not allow Ford to walk away from its responsibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cFord must give this plant a chance and work with Unite to secure a better future. We will be seeking legally binding guarantees to secure future production at the plant as well as exploring how Bridgend\u2019s production capacity can be fully utilised through the introduction of new lines. \u201cBrexit is clearly a factor here. So I appeal again to the Westminster government and Theresa May to make it categorically clear without delay that there will be tariff-free access to the single market and customs union, because the uncertainty the UK\u2019s automotive sector is enduring is having damaging real-life consequences now, before talks have even begun. The prime minister must act now because the very future of UK manufacturing, including car-making, is at stake.\u201d GMB union organiser Jeff Beck said the cuts, first revealed in a leaked document, meant \u201cthe nightmare for our members at Bridgend has unfortunately come true\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is a real kick in the teeth for our hard-working members at the Ford plant \u2013 as well as their families and the community as a whole.\u201d Speaking during PMQs on Wednesday, May said the government had been in talks with Ford. \u201cFord is an important investor here. It has been established here for over 100 years,\u201d the prime minister told MPs. \u201cWe now account for around a third of Ford\u2019s global engine production, and Bridgend continues to be an important part of that. \u201cWe have had, as I said, dialogue with Ford. We will continue to have a regular dialogue with Ford about the ways in which government can help to make sure that this success continues.\u201d Sources familiar with the firm\u2019s plans said the decision was not affected by Brexit, despite the fact that Ford has previously warned that the EU referendum decision could cost the company $1bn (\u00a3810m) and force it to cut costs. In an emailed statement, Ford said: \u201cWe announced in September last year that Ford would invest an initial \u00a3100m of an approved investment to build a family of all-new, technologically advanced petrol engines at Bridgend from late 2018. In line with this announcement, we have shared the five-year outlook with our union partners, based on what we know today. \u201cThis shows healthy volumes to occupy the current workforce over the next 2-3 years. Beyond that, identified workload is reduced and whilst such a forecast is not unusual, given the cyclical nature of our business, it is a concern, and we fully understand that.\u201d The company said it would work with GMB and Unite to identify \u201cfuture business opportunities\u201d for the plant, which would be left with just 600 workers if the cuts go through as planned. \u201cIt goes without saying, that in order to attract new business, the Bridgend operation would need to ensure its competitiveness, and addressing some of the current concerns relating to the plant\u2019s efficiency would be high on the agenda,\u201d Ford said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s known as the Long Store and at first sight this draughty building \u2013 with endless rows of plain cardboard boxes stacked neatly on shelving from floor to ceiling \u2013 could be any distribution warehouse in the UK. Only discreet red stickers reveal the valuable contents of the boxes, which every day will be driven by fleets of armoured high-security vehicles from the barbed wire-ringed site. Each is loaded with 85,000 gleaming new 12-sided pound coins which go into circulation in the UK on 28 March and are systematically being transferred to a network of top secret \u201ccash centres\u201d across to the UK to await final delivery to banks and other issuers. Here at the Royal Mint, near Llantrisant to the west of Cardiff, production has been ramped up to full capacity. Ten German-made vertical presses are working 24/7 to churn out the new coins which will replace the old, familiar round pounds. At high pressure, they are striking the two surfaces of the metal \u201cblanks\u201d, producing 40 new coins every second \u2013 and 140,000 an hour. Quality control by humans and laser sensors aims to weed out any flaws, and the vast majority that make the grade are counted by machine and emptied into the polythene-lined boxes. Security is strict and metal detectors and scanners are in use for both staff and visitors. Production of the 12-sided coins \u2013 a whopping 1.5bn of them \u2013 started in March last year and the Royal Mint is now halfway through the process, according to Scott Kuperns, its technical manager and counterfeit specialist. The switch to the new coin has been prompted because the old round one has grown increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters. The Royal Mint reckons one in 30 \u00a31 coins is fake. \u201cCounterfeiters are becoming increasingly sophisticated\u201d he says, against the noisy backdrop of one of the Mint\u2019s coin press rooms \u2013 one room makes coins for circulation while the other turns out commemorative coins and medals. \u201cIt can just be a man working in a shed or it can be more organised crime. Teams of experts who have analysed minting technology and material development. But after a lot of research and trials we have come up with what we believe is the most secure coin in the world.\u201d The cutting-edge coin, therefore, has a deliberately complex shape which makes it harder to manufacture and counterfeit. It has an image like a hologram that changes from a \u201c\u00a3\u201d symbol to the number \u201c1\u201d when viewed from different angles, while there is very small lettering on the lower inside rim on both sides, and what is mysteriously described as a patented \u201chidden high security feature\u201d. In a further ruse to try to beat the counterfeiters, it has \u201cmilled\u201d edges, with grooves on alternate sides. Its bimetallic construction is similar to the existing \u00a32 coin. The outer ring is gold-coloured nickel-brass and the inner ring is silver-coloured nickel-plated alloy. The reverse of the new coin shows the English rose, Welsh leek, Scottish thistle and Northern Irish shamrock emerging from one stem within a royal coronet \u2013 a design created by 15-year-old schoolboy David Pearce, who won a competition to create the image. Behind the scenes, work is also under way for other new coins \u2013 a new Sir Isaac Newton 50p, a first world war aviation \u00a32 and a Jane Austen \u00a32, all entering circulation this year. The Royal Mint is also a major export manufacturer, making coins for around 60 other countries including Sri Lanka, Poland and the Czech Republic. Despite the rise of card and contactless payments, coins remain popular and mintage figures are stable. There are currently nearly 29bn coins (of all denominations) in circulation in the UK, with a face value of more than \u00a34bn. Metal for all the coins is smelted on the site, and those going out of circulation are melted down and reused, a fate lined up for the old \u00a31 coins which will cease to be legal tender on 15 October. The Treasury has been urging savers to crack open their piggy banks, check behind the sofa and rifle through pockets for rogue \u00a31 coins, before they become worthless.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global markets are continuing to benefit from a renewed Trump bounce following the President\u2019s address to Congress, while the prospect of higher interest rates in the US is boosting bank shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 245 points or 1.18% at 21,057, while the FTSE 100 has jumped 1.55% to 7375 and is heading for a record close. In Germany the Dax is up 1.58% while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.98%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Snimal spirits have taken over. As expected, the Dow Jones has soared through the 21,000 mark just over 3 weeks after breaking the 20,000 level for the first time. It\u2019s the quickest time ever to 1,000-point milestone, beating the record set in 1999. But this looks a bit different to the dotcom boom and bust as we are dealing with a complete reversal in fund allocation in the form of a major shift away from bonds to equities. Today\u2019s boost is all down to the president\u2019s speech to Congress last night. Trump\u2019s rallying call to reignite the American spirit has produced the desired effect on the markets, pushing stocks to fresh all-time highs. Indeed it\u2019s because of Trump that we are here \u2013 the prospect of stronger growth, lower taxes, more spending and higher earnings is like a magic cocktail for equities. Of course details of tax reforms will be crucial \u2013 there is still the scope for disappointment as markets are pricing in a huge surge in corporate earnings. The dollar is also soaring \u2013 something Trump doesn\u2019t really want as it harms US exporters more than any tariff \u2013 as expectations rise that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates at its March meeting. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Unlike the slightly disappointing Markit US manufacturing survey, the ISM report has come in better than expected. The ISM manufacturing activity index reached 57.7 in February, up from 56 in January and better than the 56.2 analysts had been forecasting. This is the highest level since August 2014, and adds to the growing expectation that a US interest rate rise could be imminent. And the first manufacturing survey for February came in slightly lower than expected. The Market final purchasing managers index was 54.2 compared to forecasts of a figure of 54.4 and an initial reading for the month of 54.3. It shows a slowdown from the 55 figure recorded in January. As investors react favourably to Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress, US markets have followed the lead from their counterparts elsewhere and opened in a positive mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has jumped above 21,000 for the first time, adding 201 points or 0.95% to 21,013 while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.79% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.85% at the open. (This is the quickest time the Dow has taken to climbe 1000 points, having gone through 20,000 only in January) The prospect of a US interest rise this month seems to have increased following comments from members of the Federal Reserve, which has given a lift to the banking sector. The market moves come ahead of the two manufacturing surveys due shortly, from Markit and then ISM. Over in Greece a 24-hour strike by transport workers has unleashed traffic chaos in Athens and put further pressure on the leftist-led government as creditors step up demands for a new package of cuts worth 2% of GDP. Helena Smith reports: As spring approaches, public sector workers are stepping up pressure on prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government with increased industrial action. After seeing the Acropolis closed by protesting guards last week, Greeks woke up to a 24-hour hour strike by metro, tram and urban rail employees across the capital today. Workers, who will stage a similar walkout on Friday, are up in arms over legislation allowing the cash-starved Athens transport organisation (OASA) to make commercial use of stations. Arguing that the law is the first step to privatization, they claim it will ultimately undermine the public character of the transit network and hurt consumers. Protests against further pension cuts have also been announced by doctors working in state-run hospitals with a nationwide 24-hour walk-out planned tomorrow. In a proclamation released at lunchtime, the Panhellenic Doctors Association called on medics in the public and private sector to participate in the mass display of opposition against reduced pensions and increased contributions. The decision to unify pension funds would, they said, only exacerbate the paring back of desperately needed resources for the health sector. At 11%t of GDP, the IMF argues that Greece spends more on pensions than almost any other state. The protests come as Greek officials spoke of a wealth of differences with creditors who this week resumed stalled bailout negotiations in Athens. Acknowledging that headway had yet to be made on the counter measures the government hopes to install to offset the impact of further tax and pension reforms, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos told parliament on Tuesday that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed and that austerity was far from over. Sterling is now down 0.7% at $1.2293: In the markets, the FTSE 250 mid-cap has followed the lead of the FTSE 100 and also hit a new peak. The 250 has climbed nearly 0.8% to 18,915, beating the previous peak of 18,864. Back with the German inflation figures, and economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank says the figures are food for critics of the European Central Bank: Based on the results of six regional states, German headline came in at 2.2% year on year in February versus 1.9% YoY in January. Based on the harmonised European definition (HICP), and more relevant for ECB policy-making, headline inflation also came in at 2.2% year on year; the highest level since August 2012... With German headline inflation at/above the magical 2% level, new complaints against the ECB\u2019s loose monetary policy and new media headlines are likely to emerge; though with little impact on next week\u2019s ECB meeting. Obviously, increasing inflation \u2013 no matter what the drivers are \u2013 combined with low interest rates leads to even more negative real interest rates and hurts savers. Based on the central bank\u2019s main policy rate and headline inflation, one has to go back to the 1970s to find similar negative levels of the real interest rate. At the same time, however, the common German reflex to criticize the ECB and call for an end of QE is, in our view, overblown. First of all, there is very little the ECB can do about an increase in inflation, almost exclusively driven by energy and food prices. Developments of core inflation will determine future ECB action. Secondly, even in an economy operating at full employment and which is most advanced in the current cycle, underlying inflationary pressure remains low; illustrated by the drop in core inflation. Thirdly, even if German inflation was to exceed 2% sustainably, it is simply a mathematical prerequisite for the inflation in the entire Eurozone to also get close to 2%. Nothing the ECB should do about. Fourthly, the current increase in headline inflation in the Eurozone is broadly in line with the ECB\u2019s own projections. As the ECB has often stressed: these projections are conditional on full implementation of QE until the end of 2017. Finally, the ECB conducts monetary policy for the entire Eurozone and not for the best student in class. The German push for early tapering will continue. However, contrary to the situation at the beginning of the year, it seems as if the debate at the ECB has been taken off front pages and media headlines to discussions behind closed doors. Recent statements of German central bankers seem to hint at a slightly changed strategy of the internal critics of the ECB\u2019s current policy. The partly loud and outspoken criticism has given way to a more subtle tone. Last week, ECB board member Lautenschl\u00e4ger even started to praise increasing inflation, only to add that it would enable the ECB to reach its goals. On the eve of the first two important elections in the Eurozone, the ECB will in our view choose not to distort the market with tapering rumours. If and when the elections in the Netherlands and France manage to reduce political uncertainty, the ECB could already give first hints at 2018 tapering this summer. Such a timing would help mitigate ECB bashing in the upcoming German election campaign. It seems that at least German central bankers are willing to keep their verbal powder dry until then. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also expected to open higher and could even breach the 21,000 barrier. The FTSE 100 has hit a record intra-day high, up 1.24% at 7354.24. The previous intra-day record was 7354.14 on 16 January this year, and the previous record close was 7337 on 13 January. Global markets generally have been boosted by the calmer tone of Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress, even though there was little new detail on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. But the FTSE 100 in particular has been helped by weakness in sterling, which lifts the profits of its overseas earners. The pound has been hit by weaker than expected UK manufacturing data earlier, which makes any interest rate rise from the Bank of England unlikely in the near future, as well as an increase in the dollar as the chances of the Federal Reserve increasing US borrowing costs grow stronger. German inflation rose further in February, up 2.2% on the year after a 1.9% rise in January. This is the highest annual inflation rate since August 2012 and puts the country ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just under 2%. Higher energy and food costs were the main reason for the rises. But with elections due, the news is likely to see renewed calls in the country for the ECB to call an end to its loose monetary policy. Back with the FTSE 100 and although it has not yet reached its intraday record of 7354, it could hit a new closing high if it ends around its current levels. It is now up 1.13% at 7345, which is above the record close of 7337 achieved on 13 January. With Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the conservative French presidential candidate, saying he will stay in the race despite now facing embezzlement charges (he denies all allegations), there has been some reaction: On the rising markets and falling pound, Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A resurgent Trump rally gathered pace as Wednesday progressed, the European indices ignoring a mixed bag of manufacturing data. The FTSE barrelled towards a fresh all-time high this morning, rising more than 50 points to lurk just below 7350. It\u2019s its best price in a month and a half, and one that paid no attention to the fact that the UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI unexpectedly fell from 55.7 in January to 54.6 in February. That fact didn\u2019t slip past the pound, however. Sterling has spent the last few session suffering in comparison to the Trump-swelled, rate hike-eyeing dollar, and today was no different, the currency shedding another 0.3% against the greenback to leave it firmly under $1.24 (something that no doubt helped out the FTSE). Like their UK counterpart, the DAX and CAC also benefited from a weakened currency this Wednesday. With the euro down half a percent against the dollar, the German and French indices were given the green light to go big, both surging 1.3% as the day went on even despite a slight downward revision to the month\u2019s region-wide manufacturing reading. This optimism should continue into the afternoon, with the Dow Jones set to open just above 20900 for the first time in its history. The US index actually has a fair amount of data to deal with this Wednesday, including the Fed-favourite core PCE price index and the Markit and ISM manufacturing PIMs. This leaves the Dow in an interesting position \u2013 while Trump is currently the main driving force behind the market\u2019s movements, as the month goes the potential Fed rate-hike in March is only going to gain more prominence, something that could put pressure on the index\u2019s current highs. Meanwhile sterling has fallen to a near-six week low against the dollar, falling as low as $1.2323 and boosting the FTSE 100\u2019s overseas earners. The currency has been reacting to the weaker than expected UK manufacturing figures - pushing the chances of a rate rise even further into the distance - as well as the strength of the dollar as the Fed does look likely to increase borrowing costs, perhaps as soon as this month. There are also the concerns about the prospect of a Scottish referendum and the continuing uncertainty over Brexit. After an early rise against the euro, sterling is flat against the single currency at \u20ac1.1701. Markets continue to be boosted by the calmer tone of Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress, along with a - generally - positive picture of the manufacturing sector in February. The FTSE 100 is up 1% at 7336, heading close towards its intra-day high of 7354 achieved on 16 January. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.42% and France\u2019s Cac 1.45%, despite the continuing concerns over the French presidential election. Meanwhile US futures are suggesting an 88 point opening for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dipped at the close on Tuesday after 12 days of rises. Commodity shares were lifted by Trump\u2019s repeating his plans for $1bn of infrastructure spending, with the Stoxx 600 basic resources index up 1.9%. Building materials group CRH is the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 after a 10% rise in earnings. As the largest building materials business in North America, it is well placed to benefit from Trump\u2019s spending proposals, although it said this was more likely to have an impact in the medium rather than short term. More on the UK housing market following the earlier Nationwide survey. Bank of England mortgage approval figures show the upward trend since the Brexit vote last summer continued in January. The number of mortgages approved for new house purchase jumped from 67,898 in December to 69,928, higher than the consensus among City economist for a gentler rise to 68,650. This was the fifth monthly rise in a row and the highest since last March. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the bounce in mortgage lending would have strengthened the argument for rate rises later in the year if it were not for a fall in annual growth in lending to corporates from 3.2% in December to 2.7% in January. \u201cThis contributed to a drop in annual growth in the monetary policy committee\u2019s preferred measure of bank lending - M4 lending excluding intermediate OFCs - from 6.2% to 5.3%. Nonetheless, we think that supportive monetary policy will ensure that the slowdown in bank lending this year isn\u2019t too sharp.\u201d Jeremy Duncombe, director at Legal &amp; General Mortgage Club, said the mortgage aprovals figures highlighted the resilience of the UK housing market. \u201cDespite an uncertain political outlook, it is great to see the industry adopting a \u2018keep calm and carry on\u2019 approach as the mortgage industry continues to serve the needs of remortgagers and buyers alike,\u201d he said. But Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com warned that the strength was dependent on Bank of England support following the cut in interest rates last August. \u201cMark Carney and his Bank of England colleagues helped to breathe some life into it by cutting interest rates further and mortgage approvals have stood up very well in January. \u201cHowever, this may not continue for long with high levels of uncertainty around Britain\u2019s exit from the EU far from the best breeding ground for house buying. There has been some slightly conflicting data in the past fortnight regarding the strength of UK housing, but the general consensus is that things are likely to worsen throughout the year,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s more reaction to the UK manufacturing PMI figures: Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation: The slight slowing in the pace of expansion in UK manufacturing signalled by today\u2019s PMI conceals some still positive trends across the industry. Export demand gained further ground in February, offsetting a bit of a slowdown in the rate of growth in the domestic market. This is likely to be a sign of things to come as consumer facing sectors are more challenged than other manufacturing sectors as rising inflation eats into household incomes. However, it seems that investment goods will pick up the baton \u2013 more confident and busier firms, brighter global prospects and rising commodity prices should create the right conditions for growth in this industry segment. With recent official statistics confirming that manufacturing contributed positively to the UK economic performance in 2016, what we\u2019ve seen so far suggests we should be in for more of the same in 2017. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays: Two months into 2017 and despite a slowing in the rate of growth in February, manufacturers continue to register strong levels of output, healthy order books and growing trade courtesy of a weak sterling. However, despite the recent surge in exports, the sector continues to rely mostly on domestic demand and with price rises feeding through on the back of growing input costs, even with their recent easing, inflationary pressure continues to hover with intent. It\u2019s how manufacturers now respond, particularly in their investment intentions, that will help determine how long the raised level of optimism in the sector continues. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: There will be fears that the latest PMI data suggests the manufacturing sector is showing the first signs of slowdown since last summer as the UK prepares to begin in earnest the process of leaving the European Union. Yet despite persistent headwinds, principally the uncertainty around future trade terms and pricier imports as a result of the weaker pound, some exporting manufacturers are taking the opportunity to review their international trade strategies and look beyond the EU, especially taking advantage in the short term of the devaluation of sterling making our exports more competitive. Firms are also becoming more skilled at dealing with unexpected geopolitical events. Businesses in the car manufacturing supply chain are waiting to see how the PSA-Opel deal will pan out with elections in several major European countries this year. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit: While weaker than January and December, this is still a decent survey that points to decent manufacturing expansion in the first quarter. This would follow manufacturing output rebounding a pleasing 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 after declining 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. However, the PMI does point to a slowdown in domestic demand in February. This was partly offset by a welcome pick-up in export orders after a lacklustre January performance. Ongoing very high manufacturers\u2019 pricing balances remains a serious black mark in the survey that fuels belief UK consumer price inflation is headed markedly higher over the coming months and will likely reach 3% later in the year. The slowdown in growth in domestic orders in February fuels belief that there are mounting challenges for the manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, ITV has reported its worst year for TV advertising since the 2009 recession as Brexit fears caused jittery companies to pull budgets last year. ITV said that TV ad revenues fell 3% last year to \u00a31.67bn and would fall 6% in the first four months this year as retailers and food companies focus on price cuts over ad spend to win over consumers. However, the UK\u2019s biggest free-to-air broadcaster was able to pay out a special dividend to shareholders of more than \u00a3200m thanks to the performance of ITV Studios. The TV production business - which makes and sells shows including Victoria, Mr Selfridge, Come Dine with Me and Coronation Street - helped ITV more than offset the ad decline with double-digit growth in revenues and profits last year. ITV saw pre-tax profits fall 14% to \u00a3553m, due to \u00a3164m in mostly non-cash charges, while total revenues grew 4% to \u00a33.5bn. ITV, which had warned analysts of the Brexit-related TV ad decline, beat city consensus figures by 3%. Despite the weaker than expected UK factory growth, Rob Dobson at survey compiler IHS Markit said UK manufacturing output could grow by as much ast 1.5% in the first quarter: The big question is whether robust growth can be sustained or whether it will continue to wane in the coming months. The slowdown in new order growth and a drop in backlogs of work suggest output growth may slow further. However, elevated business optimism, continued job creation, a recovery in export orders and rising levels of purchasing all suggest that any easing will be only mild. Indeed, almost 50% of companies expect production to be higher in one year\u2019s time. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the figures suggested the UK economy should grow by 0.5% in the first quarter. Britain\u2019s factory activity grew more slowly than expected in February, but is still continuing to show the strong momentum seen since the Brexit vote. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers index slipped from 55.7 in January to 54.6, below the expected figure of 55.6. But it remains close to a two and a half year high. There was a slight easing in inflationary pressures which had been rising in the wake of sterling\u2019s slump following the referendum outcome last June. And here is Markit\u2019s PMI rankings: Eurozone factories grew at their fastest rate for 70 months in February, as the weak euro helped boost demand for exports. The IHS Markit purchasing managers index rose from 55.2 in January to 55.4, the highest level since April 2011. It was revised down slightly from an initial estimate of 55.5. Markit said: Companies indicated that domestic demand remained solid in a number of markets, while the weak euro contributed to the fastest growth of new export business for almost six years. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Euro area manufacturers are reporting the strongest production and order book growth for almost six years, in what\u2019s looking like an increasingly robust upturn. Companies clearly expect the good times to persist. This year has seen firms more optimistic about the future than at any time since the region\u2019s debt crisis. Companies are reporting stronger demand in both home and export markets, with the weakened euro providing an accompanying tailwind to help drive sales. Given the current buoyant demand environment, manufacturers are eschewing political uncertainty and quietly getting on with growing their businesses. The rate of job creation seen so far this year in the manufacturing sector has consequently been among the best seen in the history of the euro. Greece remains the outlier, stuck firmly in contraction territory while all other countries are expanding with the Netherlands, Austria and Germany enjoying the strongest growth. On the price front, not only are higher commodity prices and the weak euro pushing up firms\u2019 costs, but there\u2019s also growing evidence of a sellers\u2019 market developing for many goods as demand exceeds supply, which suggests core inflationary pressures may be starting to rise. And over in China: There was also an improvement in Greek manufacturing last month, although it still contracted for the sixth month in a row. Still with Germany, and seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 14,000 in February to 2.592m. This is a bigger fall than the expected 10,000 decline but less than the 26,000 drop seen the previous month. The jobless rate was unchanged at 5.9% But over in the powerhouse of the eurozone economy, things look pretty bright for manufacturers. Factory activity expanded at the strongest rate in nearly six years in February, with Markit\u2019s purchasing managers index up from 56.4 in January to 56.8. IHS Markit economist Trevor Balchin said: The survey results suggest that manufacturing [which accounts for about a fifth of the economy] will contribute to a strengthening in overall economic growth in the first quarter. He said GDP growth in the quarter was likely to rise to at least 0.6% after 0.4% growth in the final three months of 2016. Last year Germany was the best performing economy in the G7, beating the UK into second place. To continue the mixed picture for European manufacturing, French factory activity more slowly in February. The IHS Markit purchasing managers index fell from 53.6 in January to 52.2 last month, down from a preliminary reading of 52.3. Companies raised prices at the fastest pace since July 2011 as they passed on rising commodity costs on to customers. Markit economist Alex Gill said: New business from both domestic and foreign clients..increased. However, rates of growth eased for a second successive month, suggesting a downward trend in underlying demand conditions. Italy\u2019s manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace since December 2015 in February, according to the latest Markit survey. The purchasing managers index rose from 53 in January to 55 last month, and well above the 53.5 figure expected by economists. Back with the US, and expectations of an interest rate rise in March have soared after Federal Reserve comments and Trump\u2019s speech. Kathleen Brooks at City Index explains: The media is focused on the lack of detail surrounding [Trump\u2019s] tax cuts and infrastructure plans, however, the market that matters at the moment - the Fed Funds Futures market \u2013 has surged into life since Trump spoke earlier, and is now pricing in a whopping 80% chance of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve at its next meeting on 15th March; just last week this was only 34%. What\u2019s triggered the sea-change in rate hike expectations from the Fed? Firstly, the Fed itself. The President of the New York Fed, Dudley, spoke last night and said that the case for tightening interest rates has \u201cbecome a lot more compelling\u201d. As head of the NY Fed, Dudley\u2019s words hold weight, added to this he is not usually a hawk, so when he is considering a rate hike the market takes note. This was followed by even more direct comments from the head of the San Francisco Fed, who said that he sees a March rate hike getting \u201cserious consideration\u201d. Fed members don\u2019t just let words slip out when they speak to the press, this was a message for the markets, and the markets have duly reacted. The second boost to rate hike expectations is probably from Trump. Even if his speech did lack detail the President still wants Congress to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure spending programme, something he has a chance of getting through, even if it is a slimmed down version, because Congress is controlled by the Republicans. There was some expectation that Trump\u2019s spending plans could be delayed for a year or so, the fact the President has laid them out at this early stage gives the Fed the green light to normalise monetary policy to counter-balance a boost to fiscal spending. Of course, there is still a chance that the market will over-shoot and get too excited for a March rate hike that may never come. US PCE data later today, comments from Janet Yellen on Friday and next week\u2019s payrolls and wage data will all be key indicators that could determine if we get a rate hike on 15th March. Thus, it could be a volatile few weeks. Spain\u2019s manufacturing sector grew by less than expected in February and less than the previous month: But the purchasing managers index was still well above the 50 level which separates expansion from contraction. Manufacturers said they increased output prices to cope with the rising cost of materials such as steel. As expected, investors in Europe have reacted calmly to Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress, with markets on the front foot ahead of a batch of economic data. The FTSE 100 is up 43 points or 0.6% while Germany\u2019s Dax has opened up 0.8%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.9% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB and Spain\u2019s Ibex are both around 0.8% higher. In the UK, there was little sign of a Brexit-related blow to the housing market in February, with prices rising more than expected according to Nationwide. The average price of a home rose 0.6% to \u00a3205,846 last month, following a 0.2% increase in January. It comfortably beat economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.2% rise and took the annual rate of house price growth to 4.5% from 4.3% a month earlier. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said the backdrop for the housing market was mixed. The economy had performed relatively strongly on the one hand, with growth of 0.7% in the fourth quarter, but on the other hand UK consumers might be less willing to spend money in the coming months as inflation picks up. He concludes: \u201cIn our view a small rise in house prices of around 2% is more likely than a decline over the course of 2017, since low borrowing costs and the dearth of homes on the market will continue to support prices.\u201d Although President Trump repeated his pledge to build a wall between the US and Mexico, he did not say explicitly that Mexico would have to pay for it, which gave some relief to the peso. But he did attack the high cost of pharmaceuticals again, which could put some pressure on the sector, while bank investors may also be disappointed. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: President Trump reiterated that he would help to drive down the cost of drugs, which could knock the S&amp;P 500\u2019s healthcare sector back from its highest level since mid-2016. The lack of detail on financial regulation could also curb some enthusiasm for US banks. The President did not mention Dodd-Frank by name; a regulation that the financial sector had hoped would be scrapped by this administration. To cushion the blow, however, is the prospect of a Fed rate hike this month, so any decline in US banks on Wednesday could be used as a buying opportunity. Higher US interest rates are supporting the dollar, and pushing the pound lower. Sterling is down 0.12% at $1.2366 although the UK currency is up 0.23% against the euro at \u20ac1.1728. Here are the expected openings for the European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. President Trump\u2019s long awaited address to Congress ended up being more, well, presidential than usual. There was nothing there to scare the horses, although there was not much in the way of new detail in terms of his tax reforms and infrastructure spending plans. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Having built up expectations to elevated levels over the past few weeks the President set himself an exceedingly high bar to deliver, which always suggested that it could struggle to live up to expectations, in terms of additional detail to what we already know. Ultimately that is the key benchmark here, yes the speech was optimistic and Mr Trump did come across as more Presidential, however the speech merely confirmed a lot of the details that had been heavily trailed before. As to the key question as to whether it would come across as more or less bullish in terms of spending and rates there was still a significant lack of detail. This may be more to do with tempering expectations until he puts his final plans through Congress ahead of any debt ceiling negotiations. The speech merely confirmed the President\u2019s aspirations with respect to infrastructure spending, up to $1trn, while there was little in the way of content about tax policy, though we had been forewarned about that given his comments about prioritising revamping Obamacare. There were no details about a border adjustment tax, though he did reiterate his commitment to free and fair trade, as well as building the border wall with Mexico. Our full report on Trump\u2019s address is here: All this served to calm the markets, although ahead of the speech the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended lower after twelve day\u2019s of record highs, albeit down just 0.12%. That meant it has fallen short of beating the best consecutive run of closing highs - 13 days in January 1987. But in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s speech Asian markets moved higher, with the Nikkei up 1.4% to its best close since February 15. European markets are also expected to open ahead. US interest rates were also in focus after more members of the Federal Reserve suggested a rise could be imminent, perhaps even at this month\u2019s meeting. New York Fed president Bill Dudley, thought of as a dove on policy, seemed to be veering towards a rise, saying it had become \u201ca lot more compelling\u201d after recent data. It being the first of the month, there is a host of new data due, including manufacturing figures for February from the eurozone, UK and US as well as German jobs and inflation data.",

As expected, the Dow Jones has soared through the 21,000 mark just over 3 weeks after breaking the 20,000 level for the first time.

But this looks a bit different to the dotcom boom and bust as we are dealing with a complete reversal in fund allocation in the form of a major shift away from bonds to equities.</p> <p>Today\u2019s boost is all down to the president\u2019s speech to Congress last night. Trump\u2019s rallying call to reignite the American spirit has produced the desired effect on the markets, pushing stocks to fresh all-time highs. Indeed it\u2019s because of Trump that we are here \u2013 the prospect of stronger growth, lower taxes, more spending and higher earnings is like a magic cocktail for equities. Of course details of tax reforms will be crucial \u2013 there is still the scope for disappointment as markets are pricing in a huge surge in corporate earnings. </p> <p>The dollar is also soaring \u2013 something Trump doesn\u2019t really want as it harms US exporters more than any tariff \u2013 as expectations rise that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates at its March meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the day.

The decision to unify pension funds would, they said, only exacerbate the paring back of desperately needed resources for the health sector. At 11%t of GDP, the IMF argues that Greece spends more on pensions than almost any other state. </p> <p>The protests come as Greek officials spoke of a wealth of differences with creditors who this week resumed stalled bailout negotiations in Athens. Acknowledging that headway had yet to be made on the counter measures the government hopes to install to offset the impact of further tax and pension reforms, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos told parliament on Tuesday that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed and that austerity was far from over. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31632cc347b5396c4531bdb3928dedbd026b77cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31632cc347b5396c4531bdb3928dedbd026b77cc/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Strike causes traffic jams as people take to their cars.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strike causes traffic jams as people take to their cars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orestis Panagiotou/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b6d366e4b09c1763ef5106\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T13:59:41.214Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sterling is now down 0.7% at $1.2293:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/status/836937007112802309\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Quite the nose dive in the pound GBPUSD - 170 points off yesterday&#39;s highs.

Based on the harmonised European definition (HICP), and more relevant for ECB policy-making, headline inflation also came in at 2.2% year on year; the highest level since August 2012...</p> <p>With German headline inflation at/above the magical 2% level, new complaints against the ECB\u2019s loose monetary policy and new media headlines are likely to emerge; though with little impact on next week\u2019s ECB meeting. Obviously, increasing inflation \u2013 no matter what the drivers are \u2013 combined with low interest rates leads to even more negative real interest rates and hurts savers. Based on the central bank\u2019s main policy rate and headline inflation, one has to go back to the 1970s to find similar negative levels of the real interest rate. At the same time, however, the common German reflex to criticize the ECB and call for an end of QE is, in our view, overblown.</p> <p>First of all, there is very little the ECB can do about an increase in inflation, almost exclusively driven by energy and food prices. Developments of core inflation will determine future ECB action.</p> <p>Secondly, even in an economy operating at full employment and which is most advanced in the current cycle, underlying inflationary pressure remains low; illustrated by the drop in core inflation.</p> <p>Thirdly, even if German inflation was to exceed 2% sustainably, it is simply a mathematical prerequisite for the inflation in the entire Eurozone to also get close to 2%. Nothing the ECB should do about.</p> <p>Fourthly, the current increase in headline inflation in the Eurozone is broadly in line with the ECB\u2019s own projections. As the ECB has often stressed: these projections are conditional on full implementation of QE until the end of 2017.</p> <p>Finally, the ECB conducts monetary policy for the entire Eurozone and not for the best student in class.</p> <p>The German push for early tapering will continue. However, contrary to the situation at the beginning of the year, it seems as if the debate at the ECB has been taken off front pages and media headlines to discussions behind closed doors. Recent statements of German central bankers seem to hint at a slightly changed strategy of the internal critics of the ECB\u2019s current policy. The partly loud and outspoken criticism has given way to a more subtle tone. Last week, ECB board member Lautenschl\u00e4ger even started to praise increasing inflation, only to add that it would enable the ECB to reach its goals.</p> <p>On the eve of the first two important elections in the Eurozone, the ECB will in our view choose not to distort the market with tapering rumours.

It\u2019s its best price in a month and a half, and one that paid no attention to the fact that the UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI unexpectedly fell from 55.7 in January to 54.6 in February. That fact didn\u2019t slip past the pound, however. Sterling has spent the last few session suffering in comparison to the Trump-swelled, rate hike-eyeing dollar, and today was no different, the currency shedding another 0.3% against the greenback to leave it firmly under $1.24 (something that no doubt helped out the FTSE).</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Like their UK counterpart, the DAX and CAC also benefited from a weakened currency this Wednesday. With the euro down half a percent against the dollar, the German and French indices were given the green light to go big, both surging 1.3% as the day went on even despite a slight downward revision to the month\u2019s region-wide manufacturing reading.</p> <p>This optimism should continue into the afternoon, with the Dow Jones set to open just above 20900 for the first time in its history. The US index actually has a fair amount of data to deal with this Wednesday, including the Fed-favourite core PCE price index and the Markit and ISM manufacturing PIMs. This leaves the Dow in an interesting position \u2013 while Trump is currently the main driving force behind the market\u2019s movements, as the month goes the potential Fed rate-hike in March is only going to gain more prominence, something that could put pressure on the index\u2019s current highs.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b6af7fe4b09c1763ef5021\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T11:29:21.072Z\">11.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pound near six week low against the dollar</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile sterling has fallen to a near-six week low against the dollar, falling as low as $1.2323 and boosting the FTSE 100\u2019s overseas earners.</p> <p>The currency has been reacting to the weaker than expected UK manufacturing figures - pushing the chances of a rate rise even further into the distance - as well as the strength of the dollar as the Fed does look likely to increase borrowing costs, perhaps as soon as this month.</p> <p>There are also the concerns about the prospect of a Scottish referendum and the continuing uncertainty over Brexit.</p> <p>After an early rise against the euro, sterling is flat against the single currency at \u20ac1.1701.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T12:28:06.533Z\">at 12.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b6ac3ee4b047c20d904449\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T11:19:56.168Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump address continues to lift markets, with FTSE heading towards new peak</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets continue to be boosted by the calmer tone of Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress, along with a - generally - positive picture of the manufacturing sector in February.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is up 1% at 7336, heading close towards its intra-day high of 7354 achieved on 16 January.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.42% and France\u2019s Cac 1.45%, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/01/francois-fillon-sparks-speculation-with-last-minute-farm-fair-pullout\">the continuing concerns over the French presidential election.</a></p> <p>Meanwhile US futures are suggesting an 88 point opening for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dipped at the close on Tuesday after 12 days of rises.</p> <p>Commodity shares were lifted by Trump\u2019s repeating his plans for $1bn of infrastructure spending, with the Stoxx 600 basic resources index up 1.9%.</p> <p>Building materials group CRH is the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 after a 10% rise in earnings.

Export demand gained further ground in February, offsetting a bit of a slowdown in the rate of growth in the domestic market. This is likely to be a sign of things to come as consumer facing sectors are more challenged than other manufacturing sectors as rising inflation eats into household incomes. </p> <p>However, it seems that investment goods will pick up the baton \u2013 more confident and busier firms, brighter global prospects and rising commodity prices should create the right conditions for growth in this industry segment. With recent official statistics confirming that manufacturing contributed positively to the UK economic performance in 2016, what we\u2019ve seen so far suggests we should be in for more of the same in 2017.</p> <h2><strong>Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays:</strong></h2> <p>Two months into 2017 and despite a slowing in the rate of growth in February, manufacturers continue to register strong levels of output, healthy order books and growing trade courtesy of a weak sterling. However, despite the recent surge in exports, the sector continues to rely mostly on domestic demand and with price rises feeding through on the back of growing input costs, even with their recent easing, inflationary pressure continues to hover with intent. It\u2019s how manufacturers now respond, particularly in their investment intentions, that will help determine how long the raised level of optimism in the sector continues. </p> <h2><strong>Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said:</strong></h2> <p>There will be fears that the latest PMI data suggests the manufacturing sector is showing the first signs of slowdown since last summer as the UK prepares to begin in earnest the process of leaving the European Union.</p> <p>Yet despite persistent headwinds, principally the uncertainty around future trade terms and pricier imports as a result of the weaker pound, some exporting manufacturers are taking the opportunity to review their international trade strategies and look beyond the EU, especially taking advantage in the short term of the devaluation of sterling making our exports more competitive.</p> <p>Firms are also becoming more skilled at dealing with unexpected geopolitical events. Businesses in the car manufacturing supply chain are waiting to see how the PSA-Opel deal will pan out with elections in several major European countries this year.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit:</h2> <p>While weaker than January and December, this is still a decent survey that points to decent manufacturing expansion in the first quarter. This would follow manufacturing output rebounding a pleasing 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 after declining 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.</p> <p>However, the PMI does point to a slowdown in domestic demand in February. This was partly offset by a welcome pick-up in export orders after a lacklustre January performance.</p> <p>Ongoing very high manufacturers\u2019 pricing balances remains a serious black mark in the survey that fuels belief UK consumer price inflation is headed markedly higher over the coming months and will likely reach 3% later in the year.</p> <p>The slowdown in growth in domestic orders in February fuels belief that there are mounting challenges for the manufacturing sector.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b68ad8e4b08ddc9a5e4bc6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/marksweney\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T09:56:44.738Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ITV suffers fall in advertising after Brexit vote</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile, ITV has reported its worst year for TV advertising since the 2009 recession as Brexit fears caused jittery companies to pull budgets last year.</p> <p>ITV said that TV ad revenues fell 3% last year to \u00a31.67bn and would fall 6% in the first four months this year as retailers and food companies focus on price cuts over ad spend to win over consumers.</p> <p>However, the UK\u2019s biggest free-to-air broadcaster was able to pay out a special dividend to shareholders of more than \u00a3200m thanks to the performance of ITV Studios.</p> <p>The TV production business - which makes and sells shows including Victoria, Mr Selfridge, Come Dine with Me and Coronation Street - helped ITV more than offset the ad decline with double-digit growth in revenues and profits last year.</p> <p>ITV saw pre-tax profits fall 14% to \u00a3553m, due to \u00a3164m in mostly non-cash charges, while total revenues grew 4% to \u00a33.5bn.

The rate of job creation seen so far this year in the manufacturing sector has consequently been among the best seen in the history of the euro.</p> <p>Greece remains the outlier, stuck firmly in contraction territory while all other countries are expanding with the Netherlands, Austria and Germany enjoying the strongest growth.</p> <p>On the price front, not only are higher commodity prices and the weak euro pushing up firms\u2019 costs, but there\u2019s also growing evidence of a sellers\u2019 market developing for many goods as demand exceeds supply, which suggests core inflationary pressures may be starting to rise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b69152e4b05f755cc0d802\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T09:16:15.636Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And over in China:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Avonmehren/status/836863884204048385\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash\">#China</a> PMI points to robust Q1 - but weaker investment growth likely to weigh  on the Chinese cycle soon <a href=\"https://t.co/1cixmwZh00\">https://t.co/1cixmwZh00</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/9jemDlhPtX\">pic.twitter.com/9jemDlhPtX</a></p>&mdash; Allan von Mehren (@Avonmehren) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Avonmehren/status/836863884204048385\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b68e0de4b05f755cc0d7f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T09:07:34.975Z\">9.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was also an improvement in Greek manufacturing last month, although it still contracted for the sixth month in a row.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MacroPolis_gr/status/836863825559302145\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> Feb Manufacturing PMI +1.1 points to 47.7 from 46.6 in Jan (Markit). <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/economy?src=hash\">#economy</a></p>&mdash; MacroPolis (@MacroPolis_gr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacroPolis_gr/status/836863825559302145\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/836863723847495681\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"tl\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> Markit Manufacturing PMI at 47.7  <a href=\"https://t.co/lhuFNx5fK1\">https://t.co/lhuFNx5fK1</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wGr4mQpH8c\">pic.twitter.com/wGr4mQpH8c</a></p>&mdash; Trading Economics (@tEconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/836863723847495681\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b68e97e4b08ddc9a5e4bcf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T09:06:22.872Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still with Germany, and seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 14,000 in February to 2.592m.</p> <p>This is a bigger fall than the expected 10,000 decline but less than the 26,000 drop seen the previous month.</p> <p>The jobless rate was unchanged at 5.9%</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b68caee4b030b6f7c90480\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T08:59:45.285Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German factory growth at near six year high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But over in the powerhouse of the eurozone economy, things look pretty bright for manufacturers.</p> <p>Factory activity expanded at the strongest rate in nearly six years in February, with Markit\u2019s purchasing managers index up from 56.4 in January to 56.8.

Kathleen Brooks at City Index explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The media is focused on the lack of detail surrounding [Trump\u2019s] tax cuts and infrastructure plans, however, the market that matters at the moment - the Fed Funds Futures market \u2013 has surged into life since Trump spoke earlier, and is now pricing in a whopping 80% chance of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve at its next meeting on 15th March; just last week this was only 34%.</p> <p> What\u2019s triggered the sea-change in rate hike expectations from the Fed? Firstly, the Fed itself. The President of the New York Fed, Dudley, spoke last night and said that the case for tightening interest rates has \u201cbecome a lot more compelling\u201d. As head of the NY Fed, Dudley\u2019s words hold weight, added to this he is not usually a hawk, so when he is considering a rate hike the market takes note. This was followed by even more direct comments from the head of the San Francisco Fed, who said that he sees a March rate hike getting \u201cserious consideration\u201d. Fed members don\u2019t just let words slip out when they speak to the press, this was a message for the markets, and the markets have duly reacted.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"979486071f40491867bd7776c9b9b46be4d1a03f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/979486071f40491867bd7776c9b9b46be4d1a03f/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New York Fed president Bill Dudley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York Fed president Bill Dudley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Munoz/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p> The second boost to rate hike expectations is probably from Trump. Even if his speech did lack detail the President still wants Congress to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure spending programme, something he has a chance of getting through, even if it is a slimmed down version, because Congress is controlled by the Republicans. There was some expectation that Trump\u2019s spending plans could be delayed for a year or so, the fact the President has laid them out at this early stage gives the Fed the green light to normalise monetary policy to counter-balance a boost to fiscal spending.</p> <p>Of course, there is still a chance that the market will over-shoot and get too excited for a March rate hike that may never come. US PCE data later today, comments from Janet Yellen on Friday and next week\u2019s payrolls and wage data will all be key indicators that could determine if we get a rate hike on 15th March. Thus, it could be a volatile few weeks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b683aae4b08ddc9a5e4bab\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T08:21:33.316Z\">8.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish factory growth slows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Spain\u2019s manufacturing sector grew by less than expected in February and less than the previous month:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/836852324144414721\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"tl\" dir=\"ltr\">Spanish Markit Manufacturing PMI Feb: 54.8 (est 55.8; prev 55.6)</p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/836852324144414721\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But the purchasing managers index was still well above the 50 level which separates expansion from contraction.</p> <p>Manufacturers said they increased output prices to cope with the rising cost of materials such as steel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/836852382713712640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"tl\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Spain?src=hash\">#Spain</a> Markit Manufacturing PMI at 54.8  <a href=\"https://t.co/rC4KwC3wbv\">https://t.co/rC4KwC3wbv</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/j09iV32D1Z\">pic.twitter.com/j09iV32D1Z</a></p>&mdash; Trading Economics (@tEconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/836852382713712640\">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T08:22:15.894Z\">at 8.22am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58b6821fe4b05f755cc0d7d4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T08:14:10.330Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets open higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As expected, investors in Europe have reacted calmly to Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress, with markets on the front foot ahead of a batch of economic data.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is up 43 points or 0.6% while Germany\u2019s Dax has opened up 0.8%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.9% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB and Spain\u2019s Ibex are both around 0.8% higher.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b67e30e4b08ddc9a5e4b9d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/angela-monaghan\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T07:55:51.551Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK house prices rise more than expected - Nationwide</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>In the UK, there was little sign of a Brexit-related blow to the housing market in February, with prices rising more than expected according to Nationwide</strong>.</p> <p>The average price of a home rose 0.6% to \u00a3205,846 last month, following a 0.2% increase in January.</p> <p>It comfortably beat economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.2% rise and took the annual rate of house price growth to 4.5% from 4.3% a month earlier.</p> <p>Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said the backdrop for the housing market was mixed.

There was nothing there to scare the horses, although there was not much in the way of new detail in terms of his tax reforms and infrastructure spending plans. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having built up expectations to elevated levels over the past few weeks the President set himself an exceedingly high bar to deliver, which always suggested that it could struggle to live up to expectations, in terms of additional detail to what we already know. Ultimately that is the key benchmark here, yes the speech was optimistic and Mr Trump did come across as more Presidential, however the speech merely confirmed a lot of the details that had been heavily trailed before.</p> <p>As to the key question as to whether it would come across as more or less bullish in terms of spending and rates there was still a significant lack of detail. This may be more to do with tempering expectations until he puts his final plans through Congress ahead of any debt ceiling negotiations.</p> <p>The speech merely confirmed the President\u2019s aspirations with respect to infrastructure spending, up to $1trn, while there was little in the way of content about tax policy, though we had been forewarned about that given his comments about prioritising revamping Obamacare. There were no details about a border adjustment tax, though he did reiterate his commitment to free and fair trade, as well as building the border wall with Mexico.</p> </blockquote> <p>Our full report on Trump\u2019s address is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/28/donald-trump-congress-speech-first-presidential-address\">Donald Trump hails 'new chapter in American greatness' in optimistic Congress speech</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All this served to calm the markets, although ahead of the speech the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended lower after twelve day\u2019s of record highs, albeit down just 0.12%. That meant it has fallen short of beating the best consecutive run of closing highs - 13 days in January 1987.</p> <p>But in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s speech Asian markets moved higher, with the Nikkei up 1.4% to its best close since February 15. European markets are also expected to open ahead.</p> <p>US interest rates were also in focus after more members of the Federal Reserve suggested a rise could be imminent, perhaps even at this month\u2019s meeting. New York Fed president Bill Dudley, thought of as a dove on policy, seemed to be veering towards a rise, saying it had become \u201ca lot more compelling\u201d after recent data.</p> <p>It being the first of the month, there is a host of new data due, including manufacturing figures for February from the eurozone, UK and US as well as German jobs and inflation data.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-01T07:37:08.479Z\">at 7.37am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "The global super-rich will continue to flock to London despite the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU, according to a report by property consultants Knight Frank. The number of UK-based ultra high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) \u2013 those with more than $30m (\u00a324.2m) in assets \u2013 is expected to increase by 30% to 12,310 over the next decade. Liam Bailey, Knight Frank\u2019s head of research, said London would remain \u201cthe city of choice\u201d for the super-rich from the Asia and the Middle East despite concerns over Brexit. \u201cIn a European context, London is without doubt the dominant city for the wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cLondon is just more accessible for more wealthy people, it is more convenient, more connected and more open than other cities. London attracts talent from around the world, and it will continue to do so.\u201d Bailey said Britain\u2019s exit from the EU may have some impact on London\u2019s global appeal, butthe UK\u2019s membership of the EU was less important for the world\u2019s richest people than the general population. While the population of UNHWIs in the UK, which has increased by 28% over the past decade, is expected to keep rising, the number of super-rich on the continent is expected to remain flat or decrease. \u201cHere growth will be constrained by growing religious tensions, a combination of rising taxes and higher state pension obligations and public healthcare costs, and the loss of high-skilled jobs to Asia,\u201d said Andrew Amoils, head of research at New World Wealth, a market research firm. \u201cWe also expect to see some outward migration of HNWIs [high-net-worth individuals, with more than $1m in liquid assets] from these countries.\u201d More than 10,000 HNWIs left France last year, 6,000 Italy, 3,000 Greece and 2,000 Spain. However, the report points out that it is difficult to state which city or country the super-rich call home as so many own several properties across continents. \u201cThe world\u2019s wealthy are a footloose group, and the place they call home is only a starting point when trying to unravel the locations that most resonate with them,\u201d Bailey said. The global population of UHNWIs increased by 6,340 last year to 193,490, after a slight decrease in 2015. Another 60 people were added to the global tally of billionaires last year, taking the total number of dollar billionaires to 2,024 \u2013 up 45% over the past decade. \u201cOne key influence on income in 2016 has been the performance of stock markets in dollar terms,\u201d Amoils said. \u201cIn many countries this was much stronger in 2016 than in 2015. There may be widespread uncertainty, but there are also strong fundamentals in many economies, with signs of real progress being made around regulation and policy which will help economic growth to flourish in some places.\u201d The top concern of the super-rich, according to a survey of 900 private bankers and wealth advisers, was \u201cwealth preservation\u201d and was listed by 66% of wealth managers\u2019 clients. Other pressing concerns were capital growth, inheritance and privacy. Just 3% listed \u201cbeing seen as a responsible global citizen\u201d as a pressing concern. When asked to pick the least important factor when considering how to invest their clients wealth, the top two were \u201cphilanthropic outcomes\u201d and \u201cbeing seen as a responsible citizens\u201d. The super-rich\u2019s best investment last year was fine wines, which increased in value by 24%, overtaking an index of classic cars, which grew by 9%. Andrew Shirley, editor of the wealth report, said: \u201cPersonal enjoyment was considered the number one reason why UHNWIs collect and buy luxury assets. Often that pleasure is clearly connected to one of our senses \u2013 the taste of a great bottle of bordeaux, the visual beauty of a Van Gogh, the sound of a gurgling V8 or rasping V12 engine \u2013 but sometimes it\u2019s more to do with our bank balance or our ego. \u201cSome of these objects of desire also turn out to be shrewd investments so it\u2019s no surprise then that \u2018capital appreciation\u2019 is now the second-most-important motivating factor when making a purchase \u2013 although many people still find it hard to understand the rationale for buying wine when you have no intention of drinking it.\u201d Knight Frank said global political uncertainty had caused a spike in private jet travel, with the number increasing from 14,500 to 21,000 over the past decade. The report said that in some regions the risk of kidnapping was a serious concern for the wealthy, and led to 40% choosing to travel by private jet in Latin America and 38% in Russia.",

The developer behind the 224 metre tower, British Land, and its joint venture partner Oxford Properties, the global property arm of a Canadian pension fund, have sold the landmark building to CC Land, a Hong Kong-listed company controlled by Cheung Chung-kiu. The deal is the biggest sale of a single building in the UK since 2014, when the HSBC tower in Canary Wharf was sold to Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund for \u00a31.18bn. It is also one of the biggest Chinese purchases of UK property. The sale suggests investor interest in UK property remains strong, despite Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU last summer. The weak pound has drawn in global investors, despite uncertainty created by the referendum. Officially called the Leadenhall Building, after its location, the tower was completed in 2014 after a four-year construction period and broke records for rents in the City. It is fully let to a number of financial firms, including insurers Aon and MS Amlin. Designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, the Cheesegrater got its nickname from its distinctive wedge-like shape, created to preserve views of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. It drew ridicule when three bolts snapped only months after it was completed, forcing British Land to cordon off an area below the tower. It is one of a series of skyscrapers that have sprung up in the Square Mile in recent years, such as the \u201cWalkie Talkie\u201d. They will be overshadowed by the planned 304.9m Trellis tower at 1 Undershaft, which will be almost as high as the Shard \u2013 the tallest building in western Europe. Tim Roberts, head of offices and residential at British Land, said: \u201cBritish Land and Oxford Properties took a bold step at the early stages of the UK\u2019s economic recovery to develop the Leadenhall Building to generate a high-quality, long-term income stream. It\u2019s a decision which has really paid off. \u201cThis sale shows continued investor appetite for best-in-class, well-located property in London.\u201d Contracts have been exchanged but the deal still has to be approved by shareholders of CC Land.",

This was raised during the last attempt by the Murdochs to take over the whole of Sky at the height of the phone-hacking scandal in 2011.</p> <p>Separately, Lord Puttnam has introduced an amendment to the digital economy bill, which would subject all media takeovers to the fit and proper test and which is expected to be debated in the House of Lords.</p> <p>This comes after a group of cross-party politicians including Ed Miliband has demanded that the regulator launch an immediate review of whether James Murdoch meets such a test to hold a UK broadcasting licence.</p> <p>Given that James Murdoch is the chairman of Sky, Fox supporters believe there are no grounds for such a test.</p> <p>The report, <a href=\"http://www.mediareform.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plurality-review-FINAL-4.pdf\">Consolidating Control: the Fox/News merger and news plurality in the UK</a>, also raises concerns about the \u201ceditorial independence of Sky News, one of only two British television news channels with an average monthly audience reach of 10 million\u201d.</p> <p>The coalition argues that Sky News online is the most widely featured news source on Yahoo\u2019s UK news page, accounting for more than 25% of articles in February 2017 and over 50% of headlines.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bid to take control of the whole of Sky through his entertainment business 21st Century Fox should be rejected on competition grounds alone, according to research to be published on Wednesday. In a submission to the minister considering the bid, campaigners at the Media Reform Coalition and online activist network Avaaz argue that the overall market shares of both Murdoch-owned newspapers the Sun and the Times as well as Sky remain \u201cmaterially unchanged\u201d since 2011, when media regulator Ofcom raised concerns about a similar takeover. The report, which urges the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, to reject the bid given the \u201cunprecedented case for intervention on plurality grounds\u201d, is to land on her desk as Fox is expected to formally notify the European competition regulator of its \u00a311.7bn bid for full control of Sky this week. Justin Schlosberg, the chair of the coalition, said the situation in terms of media competition was \u201cdefinitely no better than last time and probably worse\u201d. In support, he cited the fact that the Sun\u2019s audience reach had increased after the removal of the paywall for its digital content despite declining print circulation; the increased reach for Sky television services through digital services such as YouTube; and research from Cardiff University last year that the newspapers had a disproportionate impact on broadcasters, for example. Cardiff University research on coverage of the 2015 general election \u201cdemonstrates the influence of national newspapers \u2013 and News UK titles in particular \u2013 over the issue agenda of broadcasters including the BBC\u201d, it said. Supporters of the bid by Fox, which is 39% owned by the Murdochs, have argued that an increasingly competitive media landscape with digital rivals such as Google and Facebook has diminished the influence of the family\u2019s media empire in the UK. Fox executives have argued that there is no need even for a referral given the increased competition. However, the coalition, which argues that the British media market place is one of the most concentrated in the world, believes media concentration has increased since 2011. In the summary to the report, the coalition argues that its objections are \u201clinked to, but separate from\u201d the concerns over the \u201cfit and proper\u201d person test. This was raised during the last attempt by the Murdochs to take over the whole of Sky at the height of the phone-hacking scandal in 2011. Separately, Lord Puttnam has introduced an amendment to the digital economy bill, which would subject all media takeovers to the fit and proper test and which is expected to be debated in the House of Lords. This comes after a group of cross-party politicians including Ed Miliband has demanded that the regulator launch an immediate review of whether James Murdoch meets such a test to hold a UK broadcasting licence. Given that James Murdoch is the chairman of Sky, Fox supporters believe there are no grounds for such a test. The report, Consolidating Control: the Fox/News merger and news plurality in the UK, also raises concerns about the \u201ceditorial independence of Sky News, one of only two British television news channels with an average monthly audience reach of 10 million\u201d. The coalition argues that Sky News online is the most widely featured news source on Yahoo\u2019s UK news page, accounting for more than 25% of articles in February 2017 and over 50% of headlines.",

      "bodyText": "As the waves in the Channel roiled and winds gusted at 80mph during Storm Angus last year, managers at the National Grid noticed something they\u2019d never seen before. Half of the power link between the UK and France, a series of 43-mile-long cables running between Folkestone in Kent to a site near Calais, had suddenly gone down. The incident seems to have been the unintentional side-effect of an even more dramatic one above the waters, as huge cargo ship Saga Sky collided with a barge carrying rocks. Although the four pairs of cables that make up the Interconnexion France Angleterre (IFA) are marked on maps, one of the vessels appears to have urgently dropped anchor as it was tossed around in the storm. The anchor hit a French pair of cables and then bounced over a British pair before crashing into another French pair, the Guardian understands. Despite being armoured and underneath the seabed, both were damaged and taken offline. Repairs mean that this week the capacity of the IFA has gone from 1GW in the aftermath of Angus to 1.5GW, and should be back to its full 2GW by 15 March. French grid operator RTE said it had borne the \u00a330m to \u00a340m cost of repairs. \u201cRepair works are ongoing and progressing well on the remaining two cables, despite adverse weather conditions,\u201d a spokesman for National Grid added. Under the contract drawn up when the link was laid in the 1980s, National Grid did not have to contribute to the repairs because only the French cables were affected. The return to full operation will be a relief to grid operators on both sides of the Channel. The link typically supplies about 5% of the UK\u2019s electricity and brings a degree of flexibility to the energy system that helps keep the lights on and stop power prices shooting up too much. Most of the time, electricity flows from France to the UK. But for the last three months of 2016, there was the novelty of the UK being a net exporter, as France experienced nuclear outages. \u201cWe are starting to see the benefits of a two-way link, of meeting peak demands when there is insufficient domestic generation available on both sides,\u201d said Steven Moore, chief executive of Eleclink, the Eurotunnel-owned company building a new 1GW link through the Channel tunnel. Last Friday, ministers attended the launch of the construction phase of the \u20ac580m (\u00a3495m) interconnector, scheduled for completion in 2019 and ready for commercial use in 2020, to carry atomic power from France to the UK \u2013 and an increasing amount of wind power in the other direction. \u201cThis is a very, very important project for the improved security of both countries\u2019 energy supply when we need it the most. 2020 has always been seen as a potential capacity pinchpoint, when you consider all the coal power stations are due to be closed by 2025, and Hinkley [a new nuclear power station] is not going to be on at the earliest until 2025,\u201d said Moore. Eleclink is one of several new interconnectors planned to help the UK avoid a shortfall in power capacity. National Grid, which sees them as a growth business, is already blasting through rock in Norway to connect the country\u2019s hydro dams with the UK through a 450-mile-long, 1.4GW capacity cable to the UK. Despite the threat of changes to the way electricity is traded across borders post-Brexit, the company is considering more connections with Europe as it believes the fundamental case for them will not be affected by the UK leaving the EU. Another interconnector, linking Scotland\u2019s Aberdeenshire coast and Norway, was last week awarded \u20ac10m of EU funding. NorthConnect is a jointly owned by Swedish utility Vattenfall and three Norwegian utilities.",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox is expected to formally notify the European competition regulator of its \u00a311.7bn takeover offer for Sky later this week, after which the UK culture secretary will have to decide whether to launch an investigation into the extent of Murdoch\u2019s control of UK media. From the point the European commission makes Fox\u2019s bid notification public, Karen Bradley will have 10 working days to decide whether to issue a public interest intervention notice, or PIIN. Bradley will have to examine what concerns, if any, are raised by the deal and she will look at areas including the potential concentration of media power and whether there needs to be a test to determine whether Fox is committed to the required editorial standards, such as accuracy and impartial news coverage. Fox\u2019s deal to snap up the 61% of Sky it does not already own will give Murdoch control of Sky News and pay-TV operations in the UK, Germany, Austria and Italy. His ownership of UK news media also includes the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun as well as radio group TalkSport, which he controls through a separate company, News Corp. Given the level of opposition to Murdoch\u2019s first bid for Sky in 2011, which was eventually abandoned because of the fallout from the phone-hacking scandal that was engulfing his UK newspapers, Bradley is expected to refer the deal to media regulator Ofcom. If asked, Ofcom will carry out a public interest test on the deal, reporting back within 40 days. If there are no concerns, Bradley must clear the bid. If Ofcom raises concerns, however, she must decide whether to accept an undertaking from Fox to address them. In 2011, Murdoch\u2019s bid for Sky resulted in a deal to spin off Sky News to quell media plurality issues before the takeover was abandoned. Murdoch\u2019s son James, now chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, has already said he does not believe any \u201cmeaningful concessions\u201d will need to be made to authorities this time round. European regulators have up to 25 days to look at competition issues but are almost certain to clear the takeover as they previously gave the greenlight to the original bid late in 2010, as well as Sky\u2019s 2014 \u00a37bn deal to buy its sister operations in Germany and Italy. In a submission to Bradley on Tuesday, the Media Reform Coalition and online activist network Avaaz called for Murdoch\u2019s Sky bid to be rejected on competition grounds alone. The campaigners published new reseach which they claimed showed that the overall market shares of both Murdoch-owned newspapers as well as Sky remain \u201cmaterially unchanged\u201d since 2011, when media regulator Ofcom raised concerns about the previous takeover bid. Justin Schlosberg, chair of the coalition, said the situation in terms of media competition was \u201cdefinitely no better than last time and probably worse\u201d. In support he cited the fact that the Sun\u2019s audience reach had increased after the removal of the paywall for its digital content despite declining print circulation; the increased reach for Sky television services through digital services such as Youtube; and research from Cardiff university last year that the newspapers had a disproportionate impact on broadcasters. Cardiff University research on coverage of the 2015 general election \u201cdemonstrates the influence of national newspapers \u2013 and News UK titles in particular \u2013 over the issue agenda of broadcasters including the BBC\u201d, it said. An Ofcom investigation found in 2012 that Sky remained a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of a broadcast licence, despite the phone-hacking affair that embroiled its then parent company. However, it published a scathing assessment of James Murdoch \u2013 then the chief executive of his father\u2019s UK newspaper group and chairman of Sky \u2013 finding that his conduct repeatedly fell short of the standards expected. Ofcom has the right at any stage to launch a new investigation. However, the regulator has had a chance to air any concerns about James Murdoch and Sky since it was announced he was returning as chairman in January. In October, he had to rely on the support of Fox, Sky\u2019s largest shareholder, to win approval for his return after more than 50% of independent shareholders voted against his reappointment. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s last bid brought together an unlikely alliance of media groups to oppose the deal including BT, the BBC, Channel 4 and the publishers of the Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph and Guardian. So far, only a number of Fox and Sky\u2019s pay-TV rivals have said that they intend to voice their opposition to the alleged dominance the deal will give Murdoch bidding for top-flight sport, movies and TV shows. Fox could make formal notification to the the European commission as soon as Thursday, which happens to coincide with James Murdoch speaking at the annual Enders Analysis media and telecoms conference in London, although it could slip into next week. Fox and Sky declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "The latest GDP figures are a prime example of the great divergence of major economic indicators and the reality that most people feel after strong economic growth in the December quarter last year failed to translate into growth for workers\u2019 wages. The treasurer, Scott Morrison would have breathed a small sigh of relief when the figures were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday. While there was little expectation that the figures would be bad, had the economy gone backwards in the quarter we would have been in a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d (that most silly of phrases) given the September quarter saw the economy shrink 0.5%. The December quarterly growth of 1.1% in seasonally adjusted terms was well above expectations and enabled the treasurer to talk of how \u201cAustralia is growing faster than every G7 economy\u201d. And certainly 1.1% quarterly growth is very strong. But before we turn up the music and start dancing in wild celebration, we should have a closer look, and a deep breath. Firstly, a big reason for the strong growth is because the figure is a comparison with the September quarter: December looks good purely because September was so bad. It is why the trend and seasonally adjusted figures tell rather different stories. In trend terms, the economy grew just 0.3% in the December quarter: And in the annual figures \u2013 which enable us to do more than just compare one bad quarter with one good one \u2013 we see the picture is pretty uninspiring. In seasonally adjusted terms, the economy grew by 2.4% in 2016, well below the long-term average and in trend terms it grew by just 1.9%, which is actually the worst annual growth since during the GFC: Thus the story the treasurer is able to tell is due quite a bit to the convention that we report the seasonally adjusted figure as the big number rather than the trend figure. And the seasonally adjusted figures can be a bit weird at times and not completely reflective of the true state of the economy. In the December quarter the big contributions to growth were household consumption, exports and public investment: The public investment was due to spending on the second NBN satellite as well as defence aircraft procurements. The growth of exports is not unexpected, but again shows the erratic nature of seasonally adjusted figures, given the past two quarters saw net exports detract from growth: The growth in household spending is a bit odd given that in the December quarter the big driver was on more luxury type items, such as household furnishings and recreation and culture: The annual figures however are more understandable \u2013 rent, insurance and health being the big drivers of household spending. And while consumption remains a key component of our economic growth it remains well down on the levels the occurred prior to the GFC: A closer look at the national accounts explains why, because the real story of the GDP figures is how nominal growth has taken off and how wages have not. Nominal GDP grew by a whopping 3% in the December quarter alone \u2013 the strongest increase in one quarter since June 2010. The annual growth of 6.1% in seasonally adjusted terms and 5.2% in trend terms is the best for over 5 years: The strong nominal GDP growth would bring a big smile to the treasurer given nominal GDP is a better guide for tax revenue than is real GDP \u2013 because taxes are paid in current dollars, not dollars minus inflation. The big driver of the nominal growth was increases in our export prices such as for iron ore and coal. The terms of trade in the December quarter grew by 9.1% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the third biggest quarterly jump in the past 40 years. Even the trend growth of 6% is historically huge: But workers are not feeling the benefits. Because the growth is driven by export prices rather than through domestic demand, a great disconnect has occurred. While nominal GDP growth grew by the strongest level for seven years, wages and salaries actually went down 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis \u2013 the biggest quarterly fall since 1993. Even the trend growth of 0.2% is the lowest recorded outside of the GFC and the 1990s recession. That is not meant to happen. Usually when nominal GDP grows, so too do wages and salaries \u2013 but not at the moment: Over the past 30 years the relationship between nominal GDP and earnings has been very strong. On average when nominal GDP has grown over a year by 5.2%, then wages and salaries should grow by around 5% rather than the current rate of 1.8%: It\u2019s indicative of the truly woeful wages growth we are currently experiencing \u2013 a growth that is out of whack with the state of the economy. There is for example usually a strong connection as well between the unemployment rate and wages growth (known as the Phillips curve). Generally as the unemployment rate falls, the growth of wages rises because there is more demand for workers and so employers have to pay more to keep workers and attract new ones. But right now the relationship has utterly broken down. Over the past 20 years, an unemployment rate of 5.7% that we currently have would be associated with wages growing by around 3.4%; instead wages (as defined by the wages price index) are growing by a record low of just 1.9%: There is bugger all reason for business groups to be complaining about industrial relations at the moment \u2013 especially in light of the penalty rates decision. In historical terms workers are the ones who are missing out. This is highlighted as well by the labour cost figures in the national accounts. Real unit labour costs in 2016 fell by 4.2% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the biggest annual fall ever recorded. In real terms, the cost of labour is now lower than it ever has been: The big number in the GDP figures might suggest things are improving, but what the numbers really highlight is that things are not as strong as the erratic quarterly growth figure would suggest, and that workers are more than ever before missing out on the benefits of the growth that does exist.",

The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the result was achieved due to strong household consumption, but warned that \u201cweak wages growth\u201d was still weighing the economy and budget revenue down. Australia has now recorded 101 quarters between the June 1991 and the 2016 December quarter without two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. Australia continues to close in on the Netherlands\u2019 record of 103 quarters without a recession, which Deloitte Access Economics has predicted it will surpass this year. The ABS found that household final consumption expenditure contributed 0.5% to GDP growth and net exports a further 0.2%. Public and private capital formation contributed 0.3% this quarter after both detracted from GDP growth last quarter. The terms of trade grew by 9.1% in the December quarter due to strong price rises in coal and iron ore. The terms of trade are now 15.6% higher than the December quarter of 2015. In the September quarter Australia\u2019s gross domestic product contracted by 0.5%, the first negative quarter in five years. Responding to the improved results, treasurer Scott Morrison lauded the fact Australia is growing faster than every G7 economy and the OECD average. \u201c[The result] confirms the successful change that is taking place in our economy as we move from the largest resources investment boom in our history to broader-based growth,\u201d he said. Morrison noted it was the \u201cfirst time ... for a while\u201d that final-state demand for all states and territories had grown in the December quarter. The treasurer said the principle driver for growth was \u201ca solid rebound in household consumption\u201d which occurred \u201cdespite subdued wages growth\u201d. \u201cOf concern in these accounts is that compensation of employees in the quarter declined by 0.5%. It was up 1.5% in the year.\u201d Morrison said that the combination of better prices and higher trade volumes had \u201ca significant impact on company profits, especially in the resource sector\u201d. \u201cHowever, I caution it would be wrong ... to assume that those gains have been experienced evenly across all businesses in the economy.\u201d The chief Australian economist for Capital Economics, Paul Dales, warned that despite the result \u201ceconomic growth will probably still disappoint this year\u201d. \u201cIn the second half of last year the economy grew by just 0.6% and we know that the collapse in mining investment has further to go,\u201d he said. Dales warned that recent falls in building approval meant dwelling investment may soon fall and record low wage growth would lower household spending. \u201cIn other words, the boost to national income from higher commodity prices will mostly boost profits rather than activity.\u201d Shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the GDP result was welcome and an expected bounce after \u201cthe horrible negative quarter last year\u201d. Bowen said stronger household consumption was \u201clargely attributable to people drawing down heavily on their savings instead of any boost to their wages which are growing at generation lows\u201d. \u201cThe national accounts show that corporate profits surged while wages and salaries in the economy fell in December,\u201d he said, noting that penalty rates had just been cut by the Fair Work Commission for 700,000 workers. Before the release of the figures on Wednesday, the Treasury secretary, John Fraser, told Senate estimates the September result showed the \u201ceconomy remains sensitive to shocks\u201d. \u201cThere were some factors likely to be of a one-off nature such as the weather related disruptions in the construction sector. \u201cHowever that there is no denying that it was a very weak quarter.\u201d Fraser said he did not believe the result represents the \u201cunderlying pulse\u201d of the economy and treasury and market economists expected it to rebound. He said in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook Treasury projected 2.75% growth in 2017-18.",
