      "bodyText": "Britain is a nation of vodka drinkers who wear Nike, prefer to gamble at Ladbrokes and don\u2019t realise Brexit will make life more expensive, according to a consumer survey by HSBC. Its report, Anatomy of the Consumer, analysed spending habits in travel, leisure, food and retail, based on a survey of 2,000 people. Its key finding was that consumers remain \u201cunfazed by current uncertainty\u201d about the economy, with relatively few reporting fears that they might lose their job or see the value of their home fall. But nearly half of those surveyed said they are worried about rising living costs, with more saying their disposable income has dwindled in the last year than those who have more money to spend. Consumers looking to tighten their belts are most likely to ditch meals out but are less willing to dispense with their annual holiday, the survey found. HSBC said it was most surprised by the fact that far fewer people are concerned by the impact of Brexit than they are by rising inflation. \u201cWe find this intriguing because the two are interlinked in our view, with rising living costs being at least partly a function of the Brexit vote,\u201d said the bank\u2019s analysts. They said the survey suggested that \u201chouseholds have not yet fully identified the link between the Brexit vote and rising living costs\u201d. Those consumers who do have money to spend had strong opinions about their favourite brands, the survey found. For instance, assuming flight times and prices are the same, travellers would rather fly with British Airways than any other airline, but would choose easyJet where it is cheaper. The bank recommended investors in shares buy easyJet stock as the preferred option among no-frills carriers. When it comes to hotels, the industry need not fear the threat that people will defect en masse to Airbnb. Sixty-two percent of people said they either have never used the spare room rental service or would never consider doing so. Instead, Premier Inn emerged as the most popular choice among budget hotels, with 30% preferring it over its nearest rival, Travelodge, on just 14%, prompting HSBC to suggest investors buy shares in Whitbread, owner of Premier Inn. Another reason to buy Whitbread shares is that its other big brand, Costa coffee, is by far the most popular choice among high street coffee shops, with three times more people visiting it than its nearest rival Starbucks. The taste of its coffee was cited as the main reason for choosing Costa. Caff\u00e9 Nero was ranked below both Greggs and McDonald\u2019s in terms of visits. For those who like something stronger than coffee, Stella Artois is the preferred beer, with 12% of people choosing it over Budweiser on 7% and Foster\u2019s on 6.6%. Among spirits, Britons prefer to drink vodka, with 18.5% choosing it, beating whisky into second place at 17.9%. Gin, which has been growing in popularity, is the favoured tipple among 11.4% of consumers. Those heading from the pub to the bookies\u2019 tend to see Ladbrokes as offering the best value for money but may not have fully assessed the odds, according to HSBC. About 17.6% of those who gamble think Ladbrokes offers them the best return on their stake, but HSBC said that, when it comes to Premier League football at least, Betfair and Bet365 are the place to gamble. Nonetheless, HSBC advises investors to sell Ladbrokes shares, citing the likelihood that consumers will have less money to spend. It also warned of the potential that a government review will lead to a crackdown on fixed-odds betting terminals, which pulled in \u00a31.7bn for gambling firms last year. When it comes to groceries, Tesco remains the most popular choice, with 62% of consumers putting it in their top three, followed by Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Aldi. Nike is the most popular sports brand by the tightest of margins, with 77.6% of those surveyed putting it in their top three compared with Adidas on 77.5%, though more people put Nike at number one. Perhaps the most surprising revelation is that only 12% of people in the UK either dislike or hate their boss, although a further 39% are indifferent to them.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce, the engine maker hit by a \u00a3671m settlement of bribery and corruption charges, is to hold its first annual meeting for staff with the aim of improving communication with its global workforce of almost 50,000. The annual meeting will be held in May in Derby, England, where the company has 14,000 staff. The board will take questions on a variety of topics after a year in which the fraud charges and sterling\u2019s plunge drove the company to a loss of \u00a34.6bn, the biggest in its history. Employee access to the boardroom at major companies has been on the agenda since Theresa May, the prime minister, raised the idea of putting workers on boards, although a green paper published last year stepped back from demanding this. Rolls-Royce is not committing to appoint a worker to its board in the way that the transport group First Group has done. The embattled retailer Sports Direct last week said it would allow a worker representative to attend its board meetings but was accused by the union Unite of conducting little more than a \u201cPR exercise\u201d. Rolls-Royce workers will have to apply for a place to attend the employee AGM, which seems likely to take place in the same venue as its shareholder meeting in Pride Park, home of Derby County football team. Those employees who own shares are already able to attend the shareholder AGM on 4 May. The process is being overseen by the former HSBC banker Irene Dorner, who is a non-executive director at Rolls-Royce, and the logistics are yet to be finalised. It is not clear if staff outside the UK will attend and plans are being made to video the event. Rolls-Royce revealed the employee AGM in its annual report published last week. Its chair, Ian Davis, said: \u201cWe note with interest the government\u2019s green paper on UK corporate governance. The board is considering the level of interaction with stakeholders, particularly employees. We are planning to hold an \u2018AGM for employees\u2019 in 2017, and Irene Dorner will take the lead at looking at how we can strengthen our links between the boardroom and our employees.\u201d Warren East, the Rolls-Royce chief executive who was paid \u00a32m for 2016, has been a supporter of greater worker representation, using the example of its experience in Germany, where the company has 20% of its staff and where workers on boards are commonplace. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cWe welcome companies looking at ways to improve employee engagement. Rather than simply strengthening links between workers and the boardroom, we need worker seats in the boardroom \u2013 as the prime minister promised. \u201cIt\u2019s a tried, tested and successful approach in many other European countries. And it would improve the quality of decision-making in British boardrooms.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There used to be an iron rule of politics. Governments that delivered strong growth in living standards were popular. Governments that presided over stagnant living standards were unpopular. Governments that served up falling living standards were booted out. Take the record of Labour governments between 1997 and 2010. During Tony Blair\u2019s first term, people got a lot better off and the upshot was a second landslide victory for Labour in 2001. Blair won by a smaller margin in 2005 following a period of more modest rises in living standards. By the time of the 2010 general election living standards were falling and Labour lost. This relationship appears to be breaking down. Living standards are under pressure as a result of rising inflation and will be squeezed much harder during the course of 2017 and 2018. Yet the Conservatives have a commanding lead in the opinion polls and recently achieved the rare feat of winning a seat from the opposition. If Labour is not deeply concerned by these trends, then it ought to be. This is mid-term, when support for opposition parties is usually strongest. The sugar rush provided to the economy by falling oil prices has worn off. Living standards, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed last week, are only 2% higher than they were nine years ago. The Resolution Foundation says that you have to go back to the days before Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice to find a decade tougher than the current one. Labour should be winning byelections by a mile. The current state of Westminster politics is all the more curious given what has happened to the economy over the past decade. First, there was a financial crisis caused by blind adherence to free market dogma and a laissez-faire approach to regulating global finance. For the right, this was what the mid-1970s were for the social democratic right: the moment when the model stopped working. Second, the Conservatives then slowed down recovery with an ill-judged austerity programme. Before he became shadow chancellor Ed Balls warned that the result would be slower growth and higher than expected deficits. He was right. A one-term deficit reduction plan has now become a 15-year slog. Third, when the economy subsequently slowed in 2011 and 2012, the response from George Osborne was to warm up the housing market by providing banks with incentives to lend and borrowers with incentives to buy. Having complained on entering office that the economy was too dependent on consumer and government borrowing, he engineered a pre-election boomlet based squarely on debt. Investment, the key to sustainable growth, remained weak. Fourth, the economy shows no real sign of breaking out of this cycle. The ratio of household debt to GDP is not quite back to its pre-crash levels but heading that way. Only additional borrowing will sustain consumer spending in the months ahead and that is only feasible because interest rates are at historically low levels. If the Bank of England attempted to push up the cost of borrowing the house of cards would come crashing down. Fifth, years of austerity and economic under-performance are now taking a toll on public services. Prisons are a volcano waiting to erupt, funding per pupil in schools is being cut, the NHS and social care are facing funding crises, and the police say repeated budget cuts mean crime will start rising. There is \u2013 and always has been \u2013 an alternative to all this, which involves rejecting austerity, an interventionist state, a fairer tax system that cracks down on abuse, a national investment bank, and greater workplace democracy. Labour\u2019s internal polling shows that the public supports this agenda. Voters are up for nationalising the railways and for workers on boards. They see the sense of the state investing in the sectors that make up the fourth industrial revolution if the private sector proves incapable or unwilling to do so. The public can see the blatant unfairness of those who rely on disability benefits to make ends meet paying the price for the follies of the financiers. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said at the weekend that he would like to restructure the UK economy to make it more Scandinavian and there are obvious attractions in Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund or Swedish-style childcare. But the internal polling also shows that when the word \u201cLabour\u201d is attached to any of the above ideas support for them halves. That\u2019s scary. In business parlance, Labour has become a toxic brand. This process began long before Jeremy Corbyn became leader. The trouble started when Labour had the misfortune to be in power at the time of the financial crisis and subsequent recession. Matters were made worse by an unwillingness to defend the achievements of the Blair-Brown governments and the inability to counter the ludicrous charge that the crash was caused by Labour\u2019s overspending. Labour spent the early months of the 2010-15 parliament looking inwards and that allowed the coalition to say austerity was the result of Brown\u2019s failure to \u201cmend the roof while the sun was shining\u201d. Disastrously, Labour appears to have learned nothing from this episode. After the 2010 election, it spent six months navel-gazing: this time there have been not one but two leadership elections. The message sent out to the public \u2013 and amplified by a hostile press \u2013 is that the party is at war with itself. There is also no getting away from the fact that Corbyn, while adored by his supporters, does not cut it as a potential prime minister with voters at large. Richard Murphy, who provided much of the intellectual heft behind Corbynomics during his 2015 tilt at the leadership but has subsequently found his advice less welcome, says the leadership has become too timid and is critical of McDonnell\u2019s attempts to boost Labour\u2019s reputation for fiscal rectitude. \u201cTo use a footballing metaphor Labour have chosen to play away all the time and with a team made up solely of defenders. They have no hope of ever winning. Even a draw is beyond their realistic hope.\u201d McDonnell has a different take. He says Labour needs to show that it knows how to create wealth as well as how to spend it. The shadow chancellor says the meetings he addresses are fizzing with ideas and that Labour needs to start looking outwards rather than inwards. Labour\u2019s political plight could well ease if Theresa May makes a hash of the EU divorce negotiations and/or the slowdown in the economy this year turns into an outright recession. But it will also require a coherent economic strategy, a political narrative, strong leadership, party unity and a clear sense of how a Labour Brexit would differ from a Tory Brexit. That\u2019s not going to be easy, because brand detoxification never is. It is a long, hard process even when it is possible. Sometimes it isn\u2019t.",

      "bodyText": "As the immensity of the consequences of the referendum strikes home, the May government is becoming increasingly dependent on the Conservative party\u2019s rediscovery of the need for \u201cinfrastructure\u201d and \u201cindustrial strategy\u201d. It was therefore entirely in keeping with the chaotic approach of the Brexiters that Theresa May should sack one of her leading advisers on both these subjects last week, because she did not like Lord Heseltine\u2019s opposition to Brexit. Yes, Heseltine, in common with Ken Clarke and Tony Blair, has not joined the band of former Remainers who have \u201cmoved on\u201d and now wish to make the best of Brexit. Bully for him. It cannot be repeated often enough that the result was 51.9% to 48.1% of those who voted. Furthermore, only 37% of the entire adult population voted for Brexit. This, of course, is what, in this modern world of alternative facts, the prime minister and Brexit secretary David Davis call \u201coverwhelming\u201d support for Brexit. Now, many commentators observed that there was barely a reference to Brexit during a budget speech delivered by an unusually cocky-sounding Philip Hammond. He apparently eschewed the habit of many of his predecessors as chancellor, who liked to sip brandy or whisky in the course of their speeches. But he was on such unusually good form that some of us wondered whether he had not perhaps had a fortifying \u201csharpener\u201d before entering the chamber. Before the event there was the usual stuff on the media that events had been propitious and that, contrary to all those gloomy forecasts, the economy had been \u201cbooming since Brexit\u201d. Well, Brexit hasn\u2019t actually happened, and quite a lot of us hope it never will. Moreover, the economy has hardly been \u201cbooming\u201d. And to those who tell me that the future of democracy will be threatened if \u201cthe will of [37% of] the people\u201d is challenged, my answer is that the future of this country is threatened by the \u201chard Brexit\u201d which looks increasingly on the cards. Now, although there was barely a reference to Brexit in his speech, Hammond scotched a lot of wishful speculation in his subsequent interview on the Today programme, when he baldly stated that, yes, we are leaving the customs union. What about the single market? Wasn\u2019t staying in part of the Conservative election manifesto? Yes: but so was no increase in national insurance contributions, the subject which caused the most fuss in the immediate aftermath of a (mostly) leaked-in-advance budget. The single market, to whose formation the British made an outstanding contribution, is an essential part of the EU that 37% of the adult population have voted to leave. Which brings us back to industrial strategy. The Treasury was developing an industrial strategy under the premiership of James Callaghan and chancellor Denis Healey in 1976-79, but this was abandoned by the Thatcher governments from 1979 and contemptuously dismissed as a failed policy of trying to \u201cpick winners\u201d. We now find that multinationals such as the French PSA Group taking over General Motors\u2019 subsidiaries in Europe want assurances from HMG that, with Britain out of the single market, they can rely on a supply chain within the UK, supported by an accommodating industrial policy and decent infrastructure. At present supply chains are \u201cEuropeanised\u201d or \u201cglobalised\u201d. Yes, the Conservative party that for a long time believed the state had no role to play in industrial policy is now rediscovering the wheel \u2013 but has dismissed Michael Heseltine, who did not need to rediscover it. And the Treasury is placing great emphasis on the importance of \u201cproductivity\u201d \u2013 ie the supply side of the economy \u2013 to provide the future growth on which higher living standards and tax revenues ultimately depend. For the uncomfortable truth, underlined by the Office for Budgetary Responsibility, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation last week, is that, after a splurge of consumer spending largely financed by borrowing, the outlook for real incomes is pretty bleak \u2013 indeed, there are already signs of a slowdown, and the OECD is forecasting economic growth this year of a mere 1.6%. And the OBR\u2019s post-Brexit forecasts are frightening. But austerity in the public sector is set to continue. Let no one be in doubt: this was a policy choice on the part of George Osborne in 2010, and it is a policy choice now. Underlying it all is the Conservative party\u2019s obsession with shrinking the size of the state and minimising the so called \u201ctax burden\u201d \u2013 a \u201cburden\u201d which helps to ensure we have decent hospitals, schools and infrastructure generally. There can be little doubt that, on his own terms, the decision of Chancellor Lawson in the 1988 budget to bring the top rate of income tax down from 60% to 40%, and the basic rate from 27% to 25%, was what is known in the trade as a \u201cgame changer\u201d. Total taxation as a proportion of national income has been around 34% in recent years. But when the economy is operating close to capacity, as the OBR believes it now is, in a decent society the ratio of taxation to national income should be considerably higher \u2013 even close to 40% \u2013 in order to provide decent public services. For all their conciliatory talk, May and Hammond are pursuing Osborne\u2019s austerity policies. Meanwhile, although for all his efforts Osborne failed to achieve anything like a budget surplus for the nation, he has managed \u2013 while capitalising on the lecture circuit upon his experience in office \u2013 to achieve a healthy budget surplus for himself. Some people are shameless.",

And the Treasury is placing great emphasis on the importance of \u201cproductivity\u201d \u2013 ie the supply side of the economy \u2013 to provide the future growth on which higher living standards and tax revenues ultimately depend.</p> <p>For the uncomfortable truth, underlined by the Office for Budgetary Responsibility, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation last week, is that, after a splurge of consumer spending largely financed by borrowing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/09/uk-pay-growth-budget-resolution-foundation\" title=\"\">the outlook for real incomes is pretty bleak</a> \u2013 indeed, there are already signs of a slowdown, and the OECD is forecasting economic growth this year of a mere 1.6%. And the OBR\u2019s post-Brexit forecasts are frightening.</p> <p>But austerity in the public sector is set to continue. Let no one be in doubt: this was a policy choice on the part of George Osborne in 2010, and it is a policy choice now. Underlying it all is the Conservative party\u2019s obsession with shrinking the size of the state and minimising the so called \u201ctax burden\u201d \u2013 a \u201cburden\u201d which helps to ensure we have decent hospitals, schools and infrastructure generally.</p> <p>There can be little doubt that, on his own terms, the decision of Chancellor Lawson in the 1988 budget to bring the top rate of income tax down from 60% to 40%, and the basic rate from 27% to 25%, was what is known in the trade as a \u201cgame changer\u201d.</p> <p>Total taxation as a proportion of national income has been around 34% in recent years. But when the economy is operating close to capacity, as the OBR believes it now is, in a decent society the ratio of taxation to national income should be considerably higher \u2013 even close to 40% \u2013 in order to provide decent public services.</p> <p>For all their conciliatory talk, May and Hammond are pursuing Osborne\u2019s austerity policies. Meanwhile, although for all his efforts Osborne failed to achieve anything like a budget surplus for the nation, he has managed \u2013 while capitalising on the lecture circuit upon his experience in office \u2013 to achieve a healthy budget surplus for himself. Some people are shameless.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump spent much of his campaign for the White House attacking the Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen. Shouting at the camera in the first presidential debate, he even went as far as to accuse the head of the central bank of \u201cbeing political\u201d, spurring her to deny she was anything but impartial. Trump\u2019s anger was a lightning rod for American savers, who like savers across the developed world, have suffered eight years of ultra-low interest rates. A rate rise this week will be taken as another sign by commentators that the Fed is slowly capitulating to the new president\u2019s tub-thumping campaign. In December, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis, up 0.25 percentage points to a band between 0.5% and 0.75%. Three further rates increase are predicted for 2017. The latest jobs figures published on Friday, which bounced much higher than analysts expected, make it a racing certainty the first of these three will take place on Wednesday. Yet the jobs figures are a legacy of the Obama presidency and nothing to do with Trump. Neither is the good news from the manufacturing sector or pretty much any other economic indicator, except the stock market, which could be said to have benefited from a significant Trump bounce. The president could decide to join the chorus of approval and even claim the rise is only the result of his pressure. But he should be cautious. An increase in the base rate, however small, will tighten the screw on younger voters and some of the poorest communities who voted for him and rely on credit to get by. More importantly for his economic programme, higher interest rates in the US will act like a honeypot for foreign investors, who will transfer their funds to New York. The bankers will adore being the prime recipients of all this fresh money and being able to charge higher interest rates, but sucking in foreign cash has a price and that is an expensive dollar and worsening trade balance. Trump might want to think twice about supporting a policy that hits exports and pretty soon the profits of major corporations. It might undermine his call for the repatriation of factories to the rust-belt states if goods cost 10% or 20% more to export. The dollar is already 20% higher against a basket of currencies than last year. If it goes up any further, corporations could restrict investment and freeze wages to compete. Trump called for higher interest rates, but not lower wages or investment. But all the signs are that the president and his chief advisers will ignore these negative effects. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, like Trump, believes the administration is about to unleash an economic revolution that will spark rocketing growth without the inflationary pressures that spur interest rate rises. Mnuchin\u2019s plans for tax cuts and infrastructure spending, far from increasing inflation alongside growth and forcing the Fed to raise rates further, are supposed to raise productivity, allowing supply to stay in synch with rising demand. Prices would stay subdued and the Fed could raise rates almost without any effect on the economy, which \u2013 in a Trumpian world \u2013 could be given the tools to grow without concerning itself with the cost of borrowing. But few believe a mix of deregulation, tax cuts and infrastructure spending can have the desired effect, let alone work their magic in a fashion that leaves inflation subdued. One of the many reasons is that the US has already enjoyed one of the longest periods of economic expansion on record. Trump\u2019s spending plans are a last sugar rush for a period of growth that is past its sell-by date. A recession is looming \u2013 and a recession delayed is only worse. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s not a full-blown crash. Something to take shine off JD Sports prize Strange how myopic the business world can be. After an evening that kicked off with an inspirational speech from cobbler John Timpson about the power of treating staff well, the retail industry handed its highest accolade to JD Sports, a business recently heavily criticised for its treatment of warehouse workers. JD has been an exceptional retailer in many ways: its stores and products are bright and exciting. Sales and profits have soared, and chairman Peter Cowgill has pulled the business back from what seemed like terminal decline. JD has said a Channel 4 documentary highlighting alleged poor practises at its warehouse did not reflect the working environment in an accurate or balanced way, but it did launch an investigation. Naming JD Sports Retailer of the Year with no mention of these problems, even in the accompanying magazine interview with Cowgill, does neither the journal behind the awards, Retail Week, nor JD any favours. Was the company not asked about the matter, or did it refuse to touch on it? The industry cannot blindfold itself to evidence of poor treatment of workers. JD\u2019s higher-profile competitor Sports Direct may have knocked out many competitors with its \u201csavvy\u201d business skills, but it has brought shame on the industry with its treatment of warehouse workers in particular. There are business as well as moral implications. Not every shopper will actively consider workers\u2019 rights when they want a cheap pair of trainers. But poor corporate behaviour can only encourage the seeking of alternatives. Sports Direct is now suffering financially, partly because major brands don\u2019t want to be tarnished by its tacky discount-focused stores or links with \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d conditions. JD\u2019s strength is partly built on its better image, which has helped it forge long-lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with brands. Maintaining that reputation should bring the issues at its warehouse into sharp focus. Barclays needs new symbols Eight foot high and 20ft wide, the five acrylic blocks that have been a fixture in the characterless, cavernous foyer at Barclays for the past four years have gone. They were emblazoned with the words \u201crespect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship\u201d and were a symbolic gesture by chief executive Antony Jenkins to show the bank was trying to clean up its reputation in the wake of the Libor crisis. It has taken 14 months for Jenkins\u2019s successor, Jes Staley, to tear them down and install screens. It was easy to mock the blocks \u2013 which were moved around the foyer to create new patterns \u2013 as a desperate attempt to look as if the bank was doing the right thing. Staley was right to move them out. But in so doing, the American banker must ensure he does not create an impression that Barclays is back to its gung-ho days.",
