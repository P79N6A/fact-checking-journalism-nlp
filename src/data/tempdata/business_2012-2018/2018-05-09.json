      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s Debbie Carson on today\u2019s oil price spike: Crude oil prices rose to three-and-a-half-year highs following the news that the Trump administration revoked the nuclear deal with Iran. Brent crude oil prices, the global benchmark, and US West Texas Intermediate rallied above $77 and $71 per barrel, respectively, in the aftermath of the announcement. The rise came after the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told reporters he did not expect a major oil price hikes because other countries would increase output to offset such losses. Although Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was not a surprise, reinstating all US nuclear-related sanctions was more than expected, said Barclays analysts in a research note. Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said this announcement comes at a time where there are increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and global crude oil inventories are normalizing after being in a supply glut for the past few years. In the US inventory levels are now below the five-year average. \u201cThere\u2019s a broad consensus that [supplies are] going to rebalance and tighten up, but you throw the possibility of disruptions of flows from Iran, and the markets started to worry,\u201d he said. Goodnight! GW My colleague Phillip Inman has written a Q&amp;A about the rising oil price. Here\u2019s a flavour: What does the nuclear deal have to do with the oil price? When Iran pledged to limit its nuclear ambitions to civil energy production under the deal with the P5+1 group of world powers \u2013 the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany \u2013 sanctions were lifted on its oil exports, giving a significant boost to global oil supplies. How big is Iran\u2019s contribution to global supplies? Iran is the third largest producer in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), which makes it a heavy hitter in the production of oil. It produces 2.5m barrels a day, equal to about 3% of global demand. Trump\u2019s threat to reimpose sanctions and effectively keep up to half of Iranian oil in the ground has hit the oil price since he was elected in November 2016. The price of Brent crude is now up 50% year on year. Here\u2019s the full piece: The rally in oil stocks has driven Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index up almost 100 points today. The FTSE 100 closed 96 points higher at 7,662 tonight, a gain of 1.3%, and its highest level in over three months. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The FTSE 100 is the best performing major European index today thanks to the rally in oil stocks. The British equity benchmark has a disproportionally large exposure to the energy sector, and the pickup from BP and Royal Dutch Shell has made it the standout market in Europe. The US withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal has sent the oil market to new multi-year highs, and the major oil titans are reaping the rewards. Over in New York shares are also rising, with the Dow up almost 200 points. Not much sign of panic over Donald Trump\u2019s announcement..... Newsflash: America\u2019s reserves of crude and refined oil have fallen sharply, sending the oil price even higher. US crude stocks fell by 2.2 million barrels last week, according to new figures from the Energy Information Administration. Economists had only expected a decline of 719,000, so this is a sign that demand for energy is stronger than expected. Oil traders have responded quickly, driving the price of a barrel of Brent crude up t0 $77.43 - a new 3.5 year high. The EIA also reported that gasoline stocks dropped by more than expected, by 2.17m barrels per day. City Index point out that French oil giant Total could lose out on a valuable contract in Iran. The slump in the Iranian rial today is a reminder of the damage that new sanctions will cause to Iran\u2019s economy. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take: Many Iranians are worried about what Trump\u2019s decision could mean for their country. The Iranian rial is already trading on the black market at 66,000 to the dollar, despite a government-set rate of 42,000 rials. Many say they have not seen any benefits from the nuclear deal. Iran\u2019s poor economy and unemployment sparked nationwide protests in December and January that saw at least 25 people killed and, reportedly, nearly 5,000 arrested. Ding Ding! US oil company stocks are rallying in early trading, as Wall Street opens for business. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 107 points at the open, as New York traders shrug off Iranian worries. Oil giants such as Exxon and Chevron are both benefitting from the pick-up in crude prices, and the prospect that Iran\u2019s supplies will be squeezed out of the market. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says: Oil has been rallying for days in response to rumours that Trump would announce the withdrawal, which clearly suggests that traders believe the sanctions will further tighten global supply at a time when some of the world\u2019s largest producers have already significantly reduced inventories. There is clearly the potential for these countries to fill the void left by the sanctions but if it aids their cause then they\u2019ll likely opt against it. Here\u2019s our round-up of the companies who could be hurt by Donald Trump\u2019s decision to rip up the Iranian nuclear deal, from oil firms to car producers and airline manufacturers: The Iranian clampdown could also affect oil giant BP. BP recently agreed to sell a North Sea gas field which it co-owns with Iran\u2019s state owned oil company. New sanctions could potentially cause that deal to unravel. My colleague Rob Davies explains: Late last year BP agreed to sell three North Sea gas fields to Serica Energy for $400m. One of the fields, Rhum, is co-owned by a subsidiary of Iran\u2019s national oil company. That means a licence is required from the US Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to allow US nationals or companies to work on it. If Serica cannot obtain that licence because of new sanctions it faces the risk of being unable to call on US-owned companies, in the event, for instance, of a fire or oil spill, severely restricting its emergency options. The sale is not yet complete and it is unclear whether it will go ahead now. \u201cWe take care to ensure we always comply with applicable sanctions,\u201d BP said. The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack agrees that the deal could be in doubt. Britain\u2019s stock market has responded to the threat of geopolitical upheaval, by hitting its highest level in over three months. The FTSE 100 has gained 35 points to reach 7601, for the first time since the end of January. Oil companies are leading the rally, with Royal Dutch Shell up 2% and BP gaining 2.2%, as Brent crude bobs just below the $77 mark. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx explains: Trump\u2019s Iranian nuclear deal pull-out and subsequent sanctions, via its impact on Brent Crude, remained the core driver of trading on Wednesday. Though Brent couldn\u2019t quite hold above $77 per barrel, the black stuff is still trading at its best price since 2014. This propelled BP and Shell more than 2% higher apiece, gains that provided the bedrock of the FTSE\u2019s own growth. Other European indices are calm today, with the pan-Europe Stoxx 600 up 0.2%. Wall Street is also expected to open higher, as investors take the Iranian nuclear issue in their stride. Over in parliament, foreign secretary Boris Johnson is updating MPs about Iran. He says that Britain has no intention of walking away from the nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action). America must now \u201cspell out\u201d their view of the way ahead, Johnson continues. He also urges Iran to show restraint, adding that a nuclear-armed Iran would never be acceptable to Britain. Our Politics Live blog has full details: Iranian citizens and businesses are facing fresh pain today as their currency, the rial, falls to fresh record lows. Reuters has the details: The dollar was being offered for as much as 75,000 rials, compared to around 65,000 just before Trump announced his decision on Tuesday night, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com, which tracks the free market. Dealers in Tehran quoted similar levels on Wednesday, according to an Iranian economist outside the country who is in touch with them. One dealer said the rial had hit 78,000, while another said he had made two sales of dollars at 80,000. Amir Paivar of the BBC Persian TV points out that there is confusion in the market, after several days of heavy losses. Brent crude is heading towards $80 per barrel, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. Uncertainty over the Iranian situation, combined with speculation in the markets, are capable of \u201ctaking prices even higher in the near-term\u201d, he explains. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the Iranian nuclear deal will have a major impact on the oil market, says City investor Richard Robinson. Robinson, who manages the Ashburton Global Energy Fund, says it will probably remove hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil from the market each day. The worst-case scenario, involving strict adherence and policing of sanctions, could see as much as 700kbbld removed from the market. A less disciplined approach, with ambiguous US guidance, could remove less than 200k barrels per day. Trump\u2019s rhetoric sounded fairly unambiguous. Although Trump would have ideally liked Europe to join him in re-imposing sanctions, the eventual effect is likely to be similar. Europe currently imports between 500-600kbbld of Iranian crude and it is expected this number will drop by approximately 60%. Iranian barrels can be easily substituted for Iraqi crudes. European companies are present in both Iran and the US. Companies such as Total and Eni may choose to stop lifting Iranian crudes altogether, for fear of being precluded from the US market. It is expected Asian refiners, with exposure to both regions, may also choose to follow the ban. China, on the other hand, may choose to take advantage of the widening discounts and purchase more Iranian crude \u2013 through various shell companies. Companies who have been dealing with Iran now risk violating US sanctions, and need to plan accordingly, says Michael Harris, director of financial crime compliance at LexisNexis Risk Solutions. Any organisation conducting business with Iranian individuals, companies or related entities could actually find themselves subject to sanctions due to the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and subsequent re-implementation of secondary sanctions. With such a significant change in position from the US, it is vital that firms re-evaluate their dealings with censured entities and regularly screen their customers against the latest and most relevant sanctions lists. If not, they risk breaching sanctions, facing unprecedented fines and reputational damage, as well as repercussions for future business with the United States.\u201d US planemaker Boeing may also be unhappy with Trump\u2019s decision. Like Airbus, Boeing has signed billions of dollars worth of deals with Iranian airlines in the last couple of years. Last night, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that Boeing and Airbus\u2019s licences to trade with Iran \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran is already hurting companies with ties to Tehran. Shares in French carmakers Renault and Peugeot have fallen by over 1.2% this morning. They\u2019ve both built links with Iran to build and sell cars, so now face being locked out again. Airbus is another possible casualty, having recently sold 100 planes to IranAir. Airbus shares are down almost 1% this morning; it will be caught by the sanctions, as its aircraft use many US-build parts. Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden, says European companies will suffer more from Trump\u2019s actions than US ones. Politico\u2019s Nahal Toosi agrees: China, India and Korea could all be hit by Trump\u2019s decision. As this chart shows, they are the biggest customers for the oil which Iran has been pumping vigorously since sanctions were lifted in 2016. Donald Trump\u2019s decision has gone down predictably badly in Iran. MPs symbolically burned a US flag in the country\u2019s parliament this morning and chanted \u201cdeath to America\u201d The Iranian parliament\u2019s speaker, Ali Larijani, accused the US president of conducting a \u201cdiplomatic show\u201d and claimed that president Trump \u201cdoes not have the mental capacity\u201d for the job. Geopolitical anxiety is driving investors into the safety of the US dollar today, sending it to its highest level since December 2017. That\u2019s bad for emerging market currencies, such as the Turkish lira, which has lurched to a fresh all-time low of 4.3736 liras to the dollar. That might force Istanbul\u2019s central bank to intervene to prop up the lira Brent crude is continuing to rise, and just hit $77.20 per barrel for the first time since November 2014. Trump\u2019s \u201cvery aggressive rhetoric\u201d against Iran last night has jolted the oil market, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM While it was widely anticipated that Trump would pull out of the Iran agreement, what is likely to leave a lasting impact on the markets is the threat that he would also penalize those who help Iran. These overall risks are encouraging traders to price in some new geopolitical risk premium, and his threat can potentially be seen as a blow for U.S allies. There is a threat of Trump\u2019s stark tone questioning U.S relations with its European allies, especially given that the likes of France and the United Kingdom had appealed for Trump not to withdraw. Some major European companies will be very disappointed by Trump\u2019s decision, having signed some large deals with Tehran since sanctions were lifted under Barack Omaba. Quartz explains: Energy giants like Total and Royal Dutch Shell have lucrative agreements to work with Iran, while Renault has a joint venture to make 150,000 cars a year, and Franco-German plane maker Airbus has reportedly delivered just three out of 100 jets promised to Iran, in a deal worth billions.... Any European companies with a US arm that agreed a deal with Iran would now be violating US law, says Adam Smith, a lawyer at Gibson Dunn who is a former Treasury sanctions official. Those not active in the US could be hit with a \u201cwith-us or-against-us sanction,\u201d in which Washington would tell the company that if it wants to keep trading with Iran they can\u2019t trade with America, Smith said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price has been driven to its highest level in three and a half years after Donald Trump ignored the pleas of European allies and pulled America out of the Iran nuclear deal. Brent crude - sourced from the North Sea - was swept up to $76.85 this morning, as traders digest the prospect of a new crisis in the Gulf. The oil price jumped following Trump\u2019s decision to impose \u201cthe highest level of economic sanctions\u201d on Iran, and to reimpose sanctions on any foreign company that continues to do business with it. In a hardline move, Trump damned the Iran agreement as \u201ca horrible one-sided deal that should never, ever have been made\u201d. This has disappointed those who had urged him not to unilaterally pull out, and risk encouraging Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Trump, though, insisted the deal wasn\u2019t working. The decision means that Iran\u2019s oil production, which picked up after sanctions were lifted in 2016, will surely now decline. That could lead to a tighter market and new upward pressure on prices. There\u2019s also a danger that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East will rise, leading to supply disruptions. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada told clients: The U.S. will reimpose all sanctions waived under the 2015 landmark agreement, he said, calling it \u201cdefective at its core.\u201d As a counter, Iranian President Rouhani warned his country is ready to resume enriching uranium within weeks. In a strongly worded joint statement, the UK, France and Germany rejected Trump\u2019s decision. Oil rose more than 3% following the announcement while the dollar index strengthened further. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets reckons we should brace for higher oil prices, which will drive up fuel and energy costs for consumers. He explains: With Venezuela still firmly in crisis and now Iran potentially facing sanctions, we could easily find that plus $70 per barrel becomes the new norm in a market which has already been tightened by OPEC. Also coming up today Britain\u2019s retail sector has suffered its worst monthly sales fall in more than two decades, in the latest sign that consumers are struggling. We\u2019ll also be watching Argentina, which has begun talking the International Monetary Fund about a new credit line, in an attempt to prop up its currency and stem market panic. Also, pub chain J Wetherspoon and bakers Greggs are reporting results to the City. Greggs has warned that recent bad weather hit sales (as people didn\u2019t brave the icy streets for a sausage roll), while Wetherspoon\u2019s used most of its statement to argue against Britain remaining in an EU customs union (it also said sales growth slowed a little)....",

      "bodyText": "Crude oil prices rose to three-and-a-half-year highs following the news that the Trump administration revoked the nuclear deal with Iran. Brent crude oil prices, the global benchmark, and US West Texas Intermediate rallied above $77 and $71 per barrel, respectively, in the aftermath of the announcement. The rise came after the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told reporters he did not expect a major oil price hikes because other countries would increase output to offset such losses. Although Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was not a surprise, reinstating all US nuclear-related sanctions was more than expected, said Barclays analysts in a research note. Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said this announcement comes at a time where there are increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and global crude oil inventories are normalizing after being in a supply glut for the past few years. In the US inventory levels are now below the five-year average. \u201cThere\u2019s a broad consensus that [supplies are] going to rebalance and tighten up, but you throw the possibility of disruptions of flows from Iran, and the markets started to worry,\u201d he said. The reimposition of US sanctions will be phased in over the next 90-180 days to give companies time to wind down operations. Does this mean oil prices will return to the $100-plus days of a few years ago? It\u2019s unlikely for now. Melek said he sees WTI and Brent crude oil prices not going much higher than $72 and $78, respectively, saying the price rise this week reflects a temporary risk premium rather than actual supply shortages. Even if some Iranian oil is off the market, Melek said there was capacity for members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to increase production to make up for the shortfall. Before the White House announcement, oil traders expected Opec members and Russia to stick to their plan to continue reducing output into 2019, which has helped bring supplies and demand back into balance. That plan could be revisited at the next Opec meeting in June. Plus there are the US shale oil producers which might make up for any shortfall. Jeff Klearman, portfolio manager at GraniteShares exchange traded funds, said he sees WTI prices holding in their recent range of $60 to $70, provided the strong demand from the EU and US continues, which may require prices staying around that level. Considering European signatories still support the deal, Iran said it would still comply and there are six months before the sanctions unfold, so there was still time to work something out, Melek said. This assumes all sides will try to work out something regarding the deal and that there will not be other supply disruptions. There is a lot of uncertainty in the market which stems from the White House itself, said Eric Armitage, chief investment officer of East Alpha, a hedge fund specializing in energy. He noted tweets from Trump a few weeks ago complaining oil prices were too high, but if Iranian sanctions curtail global supply that will only raise prices. \u201cIt\u2019s just a mess policy-wise and there is no coherence \u2026 nothing is actually making strict sense,\u201d he said. That leaves the oil market susceptible to price swings. Melek said if talks break down in the coming weeks and months or there is more aggressive rhetoric, which is entirely possible, prices could potentially spike higher. But he said market reactions like that are usually temporary. \u201cYou would really need something material on the ground that would stop flows of oil to get into the triple digits,\u201d Melek said. Wednesday\u2019s rise in the crude price was also helped by a bigger than expected weekly fall in US crude stockpiles of 2.2m barrels rather than 1m, and benefitted energy companies and helped lift stock markets. The FTSE 100 finished 96 points or 1.3% higher at 7662.5, with BP, Royal Dutch Shell and BHP Billiton among the leading risers, all up more than 3%.",

      "bodyText": "Why are oil prices soaring? Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has raised concerns that the global supply of oil will be squeezed, pushing up the price of Brent Crude on Wednesday by almost 3% a barrel to $76.95. What does the nuclear deal have to do with the oil price? When Iran pledged to limit its nuclear ambitions to civil energy production under the deal with the P5+1 group of world powers \u2013 the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany \u2013 sanctions were lifted on its oil exports, giving a significant boost to global oil supplies. How big is Iran\u2019s contribution to global supplies? Iran is the third largest producer in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), which makes it a heavy hitter in the production of oil. It produces 2.5m barrels a day, equal to about 3% of global demand. Trump\u2019s threat to reimpose sanctions and effectively keep up to half of Iranian oil in the ground has hit the oil price since he was elected in November 2016. The price of Brent crude is now up 50% year on year. Is Iran the only factor pushing up oil prices? No. Opec has spent the past three years attempting to push up the price of oil following its collapse in 2014 when the price plunged from more than $115 a barrel to below $30 a barrel. That was a result of an increase in supply from Russia, Venezuela and other Opec nations desperate for cash and an important new arrival on the scene \u2013 fracking firms in the US, which had begun pumping huge quantities of oil and gas. The recent cold snap, which affected not only the UK but much of the continent and the US, also sent energy prices upwards as demand spiralled. Has Opec been successful? The International Energy Agency says production cuts among Opec\u2019s 14 members and its affiliates, especially Russia, has had a significant impact on pushing up prices. The agency recently said 90% of the supply governed by the Opec cuts was holding to lower production limits. \u201cWith just under half of global oil supply subject to restraint and oil demand growing steadily, the impact \u2026 has been substantial,\u201d it said. How will business and consumers be affected? Prices at the pumps have edged up from about \u00a31 a litre for unleaded petrol in early 2016 to \u00a31.20 a litre today. Gas prices, which tend to track the oil price, have also increased steeply. When the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d storm was at its worst, wholesale gas prices stood at a 12-year high. Between them, oil and gas prices have been two of the main factors pushing up inflation and reducing real disposable incomes. The transport industry is also being hit by rising costs, which it is struggling to pass on to retailers in a time of squeezed real incomes and weak consumer demand. Rising energy costs are also a blow to heavy users, such as the manufacturing industry. Will prices keep rising? The US fracking industry was supposed to ride to the rescue and prevent oil prices from ever soaring again by switching on dormant production rigs. Hundreds of derricks were mothballed when the price of Brent crude fell below $50 a barrel. These can be brought back into production quickly to offset Opec production cuts and meet rising demand. It is why many analysts believed the price would struggle to get above $60 a barrel in the future. Morgan Stanley was one of the few banks to argue that US shale drillers would not be able to keep up with rising demand. Last year it said the shale sector would need to increase production from about 5.9m barrels a day in 2017 to 7m barrels a day this year to put a cap on prices. Will higher prices hit economic growth? Financial adviser AJ Bell said in a note to investors that a sustained surge in crude could lead to inflation or even a slowdown in global economic activity because higher energy and transport costs would hit consumer spending and corporate profit margins. It warned there could be a substantial impact if prices keep rising: \u201cHistory suggests that it is only when oil prices have doubled year-on-year that global growth really starts to feel the pinch. The price spikes of 1974, 1979, 1990 and 1999 all served to usher in recessions, and a near-doubling in crude in 2008 may not have helped matters then either, while even the rapid rise in summer 1987 will conjure up memories of stock market chaos.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BMW is recalling more than 300,000 cars in the UK because of an electrical fault that has caused some vehicles to cut out. The German carmaker had issued a safety call covering about 36,000 petrol vehicles last year but has extended it after acknowledging the fault could affect more cars. The company is expected to contact directly those customers affected by the recall of the BMW 1 Series, 3 Series, Z4 and X1 petrol and diesel models made between March 2007 and August 2011. The latest recall follows a BBC Watchdog Live investigation, which discovered that vehicles could cut out while being driven. \u201cWe now recognise that there may have been some cases of similar power-supply issues in vehicles not covered by the original recall,\u201d BMW said. \u201cIn order to reassure customers with concerns about the safety of their vehicles, we are voluntarily extending the recall. \u201cWe are therefore announcing today that we will take the proactive step of expanding the existing UK recall to cover all vehicles potentially affected by the power-supply issue.\u201d Mwape Kambafwile told the BBC he stopped driving his BMW 3 Series car after it cut out while he was driving in December 2016. He said: \u201cI just thought to myself, if I was driving on the motorway with my family in the car, that could have been very dangerous. \u201cI took it to BMW. The next day they called me to say they had found a fault, it looks like the cable had burnt out and no current was passing through the fuse box.\u201d BMW allowed Kambafwile to take the car home without any warning not to use it, but he said he felt too uncomfortable to drive it. \u201cI walked to work. It was a nightmare, it wasn\u2019t safe enough to drive.\u201d Last week an inquest heard that BMW failed to recall thousands of potentially dangerous cars despite complaints from customers over the loss of power from as early as 2011, until a fault led to the death of a Gurkha veteran, Narayan Gurung. Gurung, 66, was killed on Christmas Day in 2016 when he swerved to avoid a BMW that had broken down in Guildford, Surrey. He died at the scene after his Ford Fiesta collided with a tree; his wife was seriously injured. The BMW in question had an electrical fault, causing its brake lights to fail and the car to stall on a dark A-road. It was not until three months after Gurung died, in February 2017, that BMW recalled 36,000 of the affected vehicles in the UK, having previously recalled cars with the fault in the US, Canada, South Africa and Australia. Andy McDonald, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough and the shadow transport secretary, described BMW\u2019s conduct as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. \u201cThe company was aware of the potential for their vehicles to endanger the public for some time but delayed withdrawing them from our roads. It shouldn\u2019t take a BBC investigation to provoke action to keep our roads safe,\u201d he said. \u201cBMW has serious questions to answer. But the government must also explain why it did not act sooner, what action it will take to hold BMW to account, and review the powers available to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency.\u201d Alex Neill, the Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \u201cThis recall from BMW raises serious questions about the adequacy of the car recall system in this country. \u201cDrivers will be asking why it took so long for BMW to fully recall these potentially dangerous cars in the UK, several years later than recalls around the same fault in a number of other countries.\u201d Watchdog Live will air on Wednesday at 8pm on BBC1.",

      "bodyText": "A potential \u20ac200m contract between the European Space Agency and Airbus in Portsmouth will be moved to the continent because of Brexit, the managing director of Airbus said on Wednesday. Airbus will move all the work for the ground control for the new EU satellite navigation system, Galileo, from the UK to France or Germany should it win the bid. Colin Paynter, managing director of the Portsmouth based Airbus Defence and Space, told MPs that it was \u201ccommitted\u201d to this move as part of its bid for the contract, which it submitted on 24 April. The decision is a response to the European Space Agency\u2019s rule that it will only allow EU member states to be lead contractors on the Galileo work after 29 March 2019 when the UK is scheduled to leave the bloc. \u201cWe have committed, should we win that bid, we will do all of the work in the EU 27 in our sites in France and Germany,\u201d Paynter told the Brexit select committee. \u201cOne of the conditions in that bid documentation from ESA is that all work has to be led by an EU company from March 2019. Effectively that means that for Airbus to bid and win that work we will effectively novate all of the work from our UK factories to France and Germany from Day One.\u201d He did not specify the value of the bid, but it was recently reported to be potentially worth \u20ac200m. Galileo is a new 26-satellite \u20ac10bn navigation system recently launched by the EU to rival the Global Postitioning System (GPS) developed by the US military. It went live in 2016, after 17 years in gestation and is designed to provide highly accurate global positioning information for phones, cars, maritime, air, rail and emergency services. Most smart phones in the UK are now enabled for GPS and Galileo \u2013 which offers a more accurate version of GPS with accuracy of between 50 metres and 100 metres in built-up areas and less than one metre in the best possible conditions. Crucially it means the EU will not be at the mercy of the US when it turns off GPS for military purposes. The UK\u2019s access to the encrypted services of Galileo needed by the military to plan operations and guide missile has emerged as a significant flashpoint in Brexit negotiations. The government recently threatened to quit the project and go it alone by launching its own rival service; reports on Wednesday said the government was also exploring ways of banning technology transfer from the UK to the EU post Brexit. The committee heard that it would cost \u00a35bn to launch a rival system and would not be value for money. Paynter told MPs he supported the government\u2019s recent request for the EU space sector procurement process to be paused to allow the UK and EU to come to an arrangement. He also called on both sides to find a long-term solution in the interest of security, including continued participation in Galileo during the Brexit transition period. \u201cBecause March 2019 is just tomorrow and that\u2019s the problem in the industry of Galileo, we\u2019ve been caught in a timing trap. If renewal of the contracts was three years\u2019 time there wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d he said.",

The Newcastle-based firm, which has about 1,900 shops across the UK, said the bad weather kept shoppers off the streets \u2013 and away from its sausage rolls and steak bakes. The chain was also up against strong comparative performance in the same period of 2017. In an update for the first 18 weeks of 2018, Greggs said it was expecting the full-year profit to be about the same as last year\u2019s \u00a381.8m. City analysts had been forecasting \u00a387m and Greggs\u2019 shares slumped 15% to \u00a310.80. The bakery chain suffered disruption during the snowstorms, with delivery vans struggling to reach their destinations and staff unable to make it into work, particularly in Scotland and parts of Wales, which experienced the worst of the weather. \u201cFor a period of about 10 days we were significantly disrupted, with a double-digit decline in sales in that period,\u201d said the chief executive, Roger Whiteside. Lost sales would not be made up, he said, because \u201cpeople don\u2019t come in and have two lunches the week after\u201d. However, he admitted the poor weather was not solely to blame for the downturn. More recent sales had been better than March and April but were still behind January and February \u201cso there is an underlying trend there\u201d. He said that while average customer spend had increased to about \u00a33 because of the Greggs meal deal offers, fewer customers were coming through the door, reflecting the general weakness on the high street. Sales growth at shops open for more than 12 months slowed to 1.3% in the first 18 weeks of the year, from 3.5% over the same period in 2017. Greggs said its breakfast and hot food menus were proving popular among customers. The chain said sales of healthier options have also continued to grow as it has extended the range on offer for the summer. Whitehead said the bakery chain benefited from the warmer weather at the beginning of last week as it coincided with the launch of its summer menu \u2013 but then the temperatures rose too high. \u201cWhen it gets to about 25 degrees-plus, people don\u2019t go out, they tend to stay in their gardens and entertain in a different way.

More recent sales had been better than March and April but were still behind January and February \u201cso there is an underlying trend there\u201d.</p> <p>He said that while average customer spend had increased to about \u00a33 because of the Greggs meal deal offers, fewer customers were coming through the door, reflecting the general weakness on the high street. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sales growth at shops open for more than 12 months slowed to 1.3% in the first 18 weeks of the year, from 3.5% over the same period in 2017.</p> <p>Greggs said its breakfast and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/greggs-burger-king-mcdonalds-hot-food-evening\">hot food menus</a> were proving popular among customers.

      "bodyText": "Vodafone has struck an \u20ac18.4bn (\u00a316bn) deal to buy Liberty Global\u2019s cable TV and broadband businesses in Germany and eastern Europe. The deal for the Virgin Media owner, which has been the subject of on-off talks for several years, will transform Vodafone from a mobile phone operator into a cable and broadband TV giant across Europe. \u201cThis transaction will create the first truly converged pan-European champion of competition,\u201d said Vittorio Colao, chief executive of Vodafone Group. \u201cIt represents a step change in Europe\u2019s transition to a gigabit society [next generation broadband]. Vodafone will become Europe\u2019s leading next generation network owner, serving the largest number of mobile customers and households across the European Union.\u201d After Vodafone completes the takeover \u2013 which includes Liberty Global\u2019s operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania \u2013 it will have 54 million cable TV and broadband customers across Europe. Sky, which operates in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy, has 23 million. Vodafone has 120 million mobile customers in Europe. The deal excludes Virgin Media, which Liberty Global bought for \u00a315bn in 2013 in its biggest ever deal, although Colao did not rule out a potential move in the future. \u201cYou can never say never in life, but this is a pretty big deal for us and now we [must] have a bit of time to digest,\u201d he said. \u201cVirgin Media is not on the agenda right now.\u201d The deal excludes Liberty Global\u2019s joint venture with Vodafone in the Netherlands, VodafoneZiggo, which will be the subject of a strategic review in the 2020-21 financial year as part of the agreement between the two companies. The sale will leave John Malone, who controls Liberty Global through voting shares, with almost \u20ac11bn in cash to inject into its remaining businesses. The deal could spark speculation that he may once again consider buying ITV, in which Liberty Global has a 9.9% stake. The company has repeatedly said ITV, which has a market value of \u00a36bn, is overpriced as a takeover target. Analysts have also speculated that Liberty Global may look to boost Virgin Media by buying a mobile operation, with O2 an obvious target as its owner, Telef\u00f3nica, is already eyeing a \u00a310bn stock market listing to realise value from the business. \u201cWe are not saying what we will do with the proceeds, we have no transactions in the queue,\u201d said Mike Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global. \u201cWe intend to look to optimise growth and shareholder returns. This is about us being clear-eyed about where our best opportunities lie.\u201d The potential benefits of a tie-up of the UK\u2019s biggest cable operator with the largest commercial, free-to-air broadcaster was spotted more than a decade ago when NTL Telewest \u2013 before a rebrand to Virgin Media \u2013 held merger talks. It was James Murdoch, then chief executive of Sky, who, after identifying the threat the combination could make, thwarted the move by swooping to buy a 17.9% stake for almost \u00a31bn. Fries said the deal was necessary because in some markets, such as Germany, which is dominated by Deutsche Telekom, there is a lack of competition. \u201cNow more than ever, Europe needs strong competition from scaled national challengers willing and able to invest in next-generation wireless, video and broadband services,\u201d he said. \u201cGermany, for example, is dominated by one provider that controls over half the broadband market. Even together, Liberty Global and Vodafone, whose cable networks do not compete or overlap, will be half the size of the incumbent operator. It\u2019s time to alter market dynamics by unleashing greater investment and competition.\u201d A break fee of \u20ac250m will be payable by Vodafone, in certain circumstances, if the deal does not complete.",
