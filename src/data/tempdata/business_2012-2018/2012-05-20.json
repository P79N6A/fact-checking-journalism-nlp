      "bodyText": "A rise in mortgage rates, slowing income growth and persistently high inflation have triggered a sharp fall in consumer spending power during April, which could further knock the UK's recovery off course. Consumers are more than \u00a3100 a year worse off than this time last year according to one report, while a survey of consumer sentiment shows mortgage holders are feeling the pinch following interest rate rises in recent months. House prices were flat in May as the usual spring bounce failed to materialise, while shopper numbers fell in April. The squeeze on consumers is unwelcome news for the chancellor, George Osborne, ahead of the revised GDP figures for the first three months of the year, which could show Britain in a deeper recession than first thought. A first estimate of GDP found the economy shrank 0.2% in the first quarter, in addition to the 0.3% contraction in the last three months of 2011. The ONS recently revised its view of the construction industry in the first quarter, saying the recession across the industry was deeper than first thought. This is leading many economists to believe a bigger downgrade is heading the government's way on Wednesday. Lloyds said its consumer survey found consumers' spending power continued to contract in April, falling 0.9% after inflation on April last year, or \u00a3100. \"Negativity towards the UK's financial situation increased in April with 51% believing it to be not at all good,\" it said. The only possible cheer for Osborne could come from a larger than predicted drop in inflation on Tuesday, when it could fall back to nearer the Bank of England's 2% target. A monthly consumer health report by financial data providers Markit that consumers remain gloomy about the UK's prospects, especially while prices rise and household incomes stagnate. Tim Moore, the firm's senior economist, said: \"May's survey shows another intensification of the household finance downturn, with the trend moving into full-scale reverse after some encouraging signs earlier in the year. \"Households saw the amount of cash left in their pocket fall at the fastest pace so far in 2012, with mortgage holders and public sector workers feeling the greatest squeeze. \"With some mortgage borrowers being hit by rising repayments as higher standard variable rates come through, these households noted the biggest stretch on their finances and cash availability since last autumn.\" About 36% of private sector employees reported a drop in the amount of cash they have available over the month, while 49% of public sector workers reported a decline. Labour has argued that the dramatic cut in public sector employment had the effect of undermining consumer sentiment at a time when the government needed to instil confidence. It has consistently called for a more gradual approach to job cuts, and is now supported across the channel by newly elected French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Markit said its survey of households showed that an increasing number feared unemployment, despite recent rises in the number of people gaining jobs, although official figures show these to be mostly part-time. Rightmove's latest house price survey showed an average price of \u00a3242,759 in May, the first time in the report's 11-year history that the month has not seen a price rise. On the high street, footfall in the three months to April was 2% lower than the same time last year, according to the British Retail Consortium, partly owing to the weather and an earlier Easter but mainly because fewer consumers are buying anything that is not essential.",

    "webTitle": "Eurozone crisis: high-stakes gamble as David Cameron warns Greek voters", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A second Greek vote next month backing parties opposed to the European Union's bailout package would be a decisive vote to leave the euro for which contingency plans have to be made now, David Cameron warned on Sunday in a dramatic raising of the stakes. Speaking in Chicago after two days of talks with world leaders on the euro crisis, he said: \"We now have to send a very clear message to people in Greece: there is a choice \u2013 you can either vote to stay in the euro, with all the commitments you've made, or if you vote another way you're effectively voting to leave.\" His remarks are in effect an attempt to make next month's vote a referendum on continued membership of the euro. Cameron indicated that he wanted to make the threat of ejection from the euro credible by showing the Greeks that preparations are being made for their departure, a change of tactics after weeks of mixed messages from the European commission on whether such plans are being laid. It is a piece of high-stakes diplomacy since his threat may either anger Greek voters, driving them into the arms of the radical parties, or act as a sobering warning that the end game is truly imminent and renegotiation of the EU-imposed austerity package is not an option. Speaking in Chicago after a meeting of G8 world leaders, he said of the Greeks: \"They can vote to stay in the eurozone and meet their commitments or they can vote to give up on their commitments and in effect give up on the eurozone. \"I think the point that was very clear from the G8 was that the eurozone has to put in place the most robust contingency plans for both eventualities.\" The thinking of eurozone leaders had been crystallised by the two days of talks, he said. \"The world is suffering from the continued uncertainty in the eurozone. So this decision point, the Greek election, has got to become the moment where all of the right plans are put in place to secure the future of the eurozone currency, the eurozone economy, and therefore help stabilise the global economy. \"It's not for me to say what Greek parties should and shouldn't stand on and how the Greek elections should work. But it's very important that everyone is clear that the choice Greece faces is maintaining its commitments and maintaining itself in the eurozone, or deciding that is not the path it wants to take. What would be bad for Greece, bad for Europe and bad for the world is if we just allowed the can to be kicked further down the road with an inconclusive outcome. What's required is decisiveness, strong action by all governments. This is a moment of clarity. \"There needs to be a resolution because it's the lack of resolution that's leading to a lack of confidence.\" Cameron said he did not want to go into details about the contingency plans already put in place, but the European monetary authorities had a big role. One idea proposed by the Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, is for a European system of guarantees for bank deposits, a move that would require a degree of Europe-wide bank co-ordination never before seen. Greece has about \u20ac400bn (\u00a3322bn) in external debts, which its government, banks and companies would probably pay only in part or in drachmas. The fear is that a Greek ejection would lead to bank runs across Europe. Germany also ratcheted up the pressure when the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, warned Europe's central banks not to increase their exposure to Greece because of political uncertainty there before the elections. The crisis has been exacerbated by the revelation that the Spanish deficit is larger than previously feared, putting extra pressure on its struggling banking sector. Angela Merkel demanded that her Spanish counterpart, Mariano Rajoy, meet her in Chicago on Sunday amid worries that financial markets will turn on Spain after its belated recognition on Friday night that regional governments had blown an extra \u20ac4bn hole in last year's budget. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, became the first European leader to suggest the Spanish banks clearly needed fresh capital. \"It would surely be necessary that this recapitalisation be done with the European solidarity mechanisms,\" he said. Rajoy's conservative People's party (PP) government, however, is resisting what it sees as a humiliating move towards European intervention in Spanish banks. \"I can't believe that Mr Hollande said that, because Mr Hollande does not know what is the state of Spanish banks,\" Rajoy said before his meeting with Merkel on a riverboat in Chicago, where they were attending a Nato leaders' conference. Doubts about Spanish banks, increased by the recent nationalisation of Bankia, will see Rajoy's government name two independent auditors to value their assets on Monday. EU leaders will meet at an informal dinner on Wednesday to discuss a growth agenda for Europe after Barack Obama said over the weekend that the continent needed something more than a universal austerity package to survive, including a willingness by Germany to do more, either by reflating its demand or by accepting the mutualisation of EU sovereign debt. Obama's own re-election hopes rest on the state of the US economy, and the prospect of months more uncertainty in Europe will do little to boost jobs in the US. Cameron said: \"I have great respect for Angela Merkel. She wants to make sure countries in the eurozone who have signed up to commitments meet those commitments. She's absolutely right to say deficit reduction is an absolutely vital part of getting the European economy back to growth and health. \"I think she did show some flexibility on what more can be done on the growth agenda and what more can be done to handle the risks inside the eurozone. As I say, I think the fact that we got countries like Japan, Canada, America round the table as well as Britain who are outside the eurozone but are affected by what happens inside the eurozone was helpful in bringing that important pressure to bear.\"",
