    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For battle weary euro politicians, four long, tough weeks lie ahead between now and the next round of Greek elections, which could see recession-hit voters restating their determination to reject the savage austerity measures that are the price of Greece's latest \u20ac130bn (\u00a3105bn) bailout. But over the past two years, events have repeatedly been taken out of the hands of Europe's leaders by the markets or a furious public \u2013 and analysts warn that the crisis could spiral beyond their control even before the Greeks get the chance to go to the polls. As another frenzied week in euroland drew to a close, Spanish banks became the latest focus of anxiety as ratings agency Moody's downgraded 16 of them \u2013 including Santander's UK arm \u2013 on Thursday night. In all the eurozone's struggling peripheral economies \u2013 Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain \u2013 governments and banks are locked together in what Sony Kapoor, of Brussels-based thinktank Re-Define, calls a \"dance of death\". The weaker each economy becomes, the more bad debts its banks are forced to declare; and the more likely it is that their governments will be forced to set aside fresh resources to recapitalise them. At the same time, much of the banks' capital base \u2013 their safest assets \u2013 are made up of the bonds of their home country's government, which become shakier investments as the governments are forced to stand behind their banks. Madrid announced last week that Spanish banks were sitting on \u20ac148bn of bad loans in March. It was also forced to deny that one bailed-out lender, Bankia, was facing a dramatic run on its deposits. Bankia's share price at one point plunged by more than a quarter. A bank run of the sort that helped bring down Northern Rock in the UK is one of the greatest fears facing Europe's leaders, because once panic-stricken savers take matters into their own hands, their fears can quickly become self-fulfilling. If a \"Grexit\" did materialise, businesses and consumers could respond by pulling their money out of financial institutions, not just in Greece but also Spain, Italy, Portugal and even Ireland, as they contemplated the possibility that others could follow Athens out of the single currency. Megan Greene, director of European economics at Roubini Global Economics, says: \"The biggest risk over the next month is from a bank run.\" There may not have been queues outside branches, but already deposits in Greek banks are down by almost a third since before the crisis, and central bank governor George Provopoulos said that withdrawals had hit \u20ac700m in a single week. \"We're seeing a 'bank jog' in Greece already,\" Greene says. \"People have been withdrawing deposits right, left and centre,\" agrees Neil Mellor of BNY Mellon. Greene believes European politicians could assuage savers' concerns in the coming days by declaring a Europe-wide deposit protection scheme; but that would fall foul of Germany's opposition to offering blanket support to struggling states. \"No one is going to feel very calmed by the Greek government saying 'We're going to backstop all your deposits,'\" she says. Danny Gabay, director of City consultancy Fathom, says what Europe faces is fundamentally a banking crisis. \"It's not who borrowed: it's who lent,\" he says. \"That's the problem. The people in their tents outside St Paul's were not complaining about the person who borrowed six times their income; they were complaining about the banks, which should have known better.\" It was severe strains in Europe's banks, and the risk of a full-blown credit crunch, that prompted Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, to pump \u20ac1 trillion worth of cheap loans into the financial sector late last year, though analysts immediately warned that the drastic emergency measure would merely buy time. As the Greek elections approach, European leaders are walking a tightrope. They must try to convince Greek voters that even brutal austerity is better than the dire consequences of being chucked out of the euro, while reassuring the markets and anxious voters in other countries that they could handle a \"Grexit\". With the latest gathering of EU leaders taking place this Wednesday, the outline is already emerging of a package of pro-growth measures, centred on an expansion of lending to infrastructure projects and small to medium-sized businesses by the EU-backed European Investment Bank (EIB). Greene says that these proposals may provide a modest boost to growth over the medium term, and allow Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to adopt a more united political front, but that they do not tackle the underlying problem: that Greece \u2013 and, she believes, ultimately Spain \u2013 are in an unsustainable financial position. \"It's not like Europe is in need of infrastructure,\" she says. Mellor says: \"If they do something with the EIB, the market will be content to give it the benefit of the doubt; but it just buys more time.\" As the storm rages, the keepers of the euro flame have lined up to offer radical ways to rewrite the single currency's rules to make the project more viable in the long term. Jean-Claude Trichet, who stood down as president of the European Central Bank last autumn, made a speech on Thursday night in which he argued that eurozone states should be able to declare fellow members bankrupt, and take over their tax and spending policy \u2013 an idea that the economist Nouriel Roubini rapidly dismissed as \"totally undermining national sovereignty\". The European Stability Mechanism \u2013 the \u20ac500bn rescue fund that will be able to pay out to help states in distress \u2013 comes into operation at the beginning of July, and the International Monetary Fund has also boosted its resources in readiness to come to Europe's aid. But ultimately, most analysts believe whatever Greece decides in a month's time, the crisis is unlikely to be cauterised until politicians make what Mellor calls a \"monumental, megalithic decision\": to allow the ECB to freely lend cash-strapped banks as much as they need to stay afloat; and to allow eurozone governments to stand behind each other, come what may. That would mean tackling Germany's deep-seated political opposition to offering open-ended bailouts to countries it believes have behaved irresponsibly \u2013 something that still looks highly unlikely, despite growing evidence of a change of mood in other European countries. Meanwhile, the Bank of England and the Treasury in the UK, and hundreds of firms across Europe, will continue hurriedly drawing up contingency plans as they watch the euro \"tearing itself apart,\" as Sir Mervyn King put it last week. EU trade commissioner Karel de Gucht caused a flurry of excitement in the markets on Friday by apparently admitting in an interview with Belgian newspaper De Standaard that the commission itself was working on contingency plans for Greece leaving the euro. A spokesman for commission president Jos\u00e9-Manuel Barroso later denied it, but most experts believe it would be irresponsible for Europe's institutions not to be preparing for the worst. While Alexis Tsipras, the leader of Greece's anti-austerity Syriza party, talks tough in the runup to the election, some senior EU figures seem to have begun to comfort themselves with idea that they could contain the consequences of a \"Grexit\"; but Gabay says the term itself gives the misleading impression that the crisis would centre on Athens. \"The Greeks already have a word for exit: it's Exodus. And the point about Exodus was the consequences were pretty damned painful. I'm not saying there are going to be rivers of blood or 40 days in the wilderness, but it's very dangerous to think this is just about Greece.\"",

There is even a bakery selling rebaked bread \u2013 rolls and pastries that are brought in frozen from the UK. \"We're even selling tea to the Chinese \u2013 they like the more interesting infusions,\" says Stephen Rayfield, country manager for China at M&amp;S. UK food and drinks manufacturers, along with supermarkets, are queuing up to tap into China's burgeoning taste for western food. At a time when British brands such as Weetabix are being gobbled up by Chinese companies, a growing number of UK businesses hope to grab their own slice of the booming Chinese grocery market. They have the full support of the UK government. As part of David Cameron's \"march of the makers\", the government in January announced a drive to boost British food and drink exports to countries like China. Agriculture and food minister Jim Paice flew to Dubai to tout British produce the following month, and is now touring China. Food and drink is one of the biggest sub-sectors of Britain's manufacturing industry, which makes up a tenth of the economy. \"In so many cases the Chinese have taken over our manufacturing base, but with British food they can't do that,\" says Lance Forman of H Forman &amp; Sons, the last smokery still operating in east London. The firm, founded by a Jewish immigrant from Russia at the start of the last century, has been exporting smoked salmon to Hong Kong for the last 30 years and now wants to break into China. \"One hundred years of history \u2013 the Chinese can't copy that,\" he adds. Chinese eating habits have started to mimic those in the west \u2013 the growing middle class has started having cereal for breakfast rather than rice; chocolate, crisps and biscuits as special treats; and using teabags rather than traditional leaf tea. This brings mixed blessings: nutrition experts warn that obesity is already growing among the younger generation in big cities. China recently overtook the US to become the world's biggest market for grocery shopping, underpinned by an expanding population, a shift to more expensive foods and strong economic growth. It is predicted to grow twice as fast as the US to be worth almost \u00a3950bn by 2015 \u2013 from \u00a3609bn at the end of 2011 \u2013 according to industry researchers IGD. Tesco already has more than 100 stores in China, and Sainsbury's is believed to be in talks with a potential partner about entering the Chinese market. Its team in Shanghai has conducted a thorough feasibility study, following consumers in and out of shops and traditional markets. A spokesman said: \"We do not see international expansion as part of our short-term plans but we are exploring other possibilities for growth in the medium to long term.\" Sainsbury's is still smarting from its disastrous foray into Egypt in 1999. It pulled out in 2001 after running up losses of more than \u00a3100m in just two years in the country, which had no tradition of supermarket shopping. Sainsbury's then chairman, Sir Peter Davis, admitted the company had gone in \"too far, too fast\". M&amp;S has four fashion-and-food stores in Shanghai after opening the first one, measuring 5,000 sq metres, in 2008, as well as three others in the smaller cities of Ningbo, Changzhou and Wuhan. It got off to a rocky start but intends to focus on Shanghai, where a rapidly growing new strata of Chinese society \u2013 the urban rich \u2013 has developed a taste for western brands from Prada to Gucci, along with French wine, Spanish olive oil and British biscuits and beer. Shanghai is the world's fastest-growing city economy, with a population of more than 20 million. Chinese food importer Gorden Wei, chairman of Shanghai Ted Enterprises and vice-president of the Shanghai Import Food Enterprises Association, says Chinese consumers are \"quite conceptual\". That is to say, they associate wine with France (in particular Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild from the Bordeaux region), chocolate with Belgium and whisky with Scotland. He worries that Chinese shoppers are not sophisticated enough to remember more than a handful of western brands. \"We're doing a missionary job; we're educating people about other brands,\" says Wei. He also warns British exporters not to expect to sell in big volumes, arguing that goods such as Campbells Shortbread are regarded as a \"high-end product\" in China. But this does not worry Rayfield at M&amp;S, who has seen \"made in Britain\" food and drink fly off the shelves in the six months he has been in Shanghai. Some 17,000 packs of crisps and nuts were sold in the last quarter, more than double the level a year ago, as well as 35,000 pieces of frozen fish, up 26%. Much of the western food available, such as biscuits and chocolate, is bought by consumers as gifts for others or treats for themselves. \"We're at the top end of the market,\" says Rayfield. \"The Chinese customer sees us for that as well. They come in to top up, to buy a treat from us. We're not going to be an everyday supermarket.\" That doesn't come as a big surprise after a quick look at the high price tag. Similarly, in the City Shop adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Shanghai \u2013 part of a local supermarket chain \u2013 a box of Dorset Cereals muesli is priced at 104 yuan \u2013 roughly \u00a310. A pack of PG Tips is 78 yuan. This shop caters mainly for expats, but a new, bigger City Shop has now opened in downtown Shanghai to lure in Chinese shoppers. Different taste buds are another challenge. For example, Chinese customers found Cadbury's chocolate too sweet initially, recounts Elina Wen, purchasing director at importer Pinlive (Shanghai) Foods. As in other countries, Tesco has adapted its ranges to cater for local tastes. For example, it stocks lots of bulk rice, many different types of live fish and has a dim sum counter. It also offers a wide range of baby products \u2013 formula milk, disposable nappies, strollers and bikes \u2013 because China's one-child policy means that families spend a lot of money on their only child. Tesco has opened more than 100 hypermarkets along the Chinese east coast since its launch there in 2004. It has also developed its own shopping malls, branded \"Lifespace\", which are anchored by a Tesco store. At last count sales in the country had reached \u00a31.3bn. Tyrrells crisps, made on a farm in Herefordshire, have also found their way to China through a big Shanghai-based distributor, Sinodis, which also distributes Weetabix, Haribo and Dr Oetker. \"If you want a little bit of England, Tyrrells is for you,\" says the firm's marketing director, Oliver Rudgard. \"The Chinese market is very similar to India: it has not reached its full potential. The large retail brands only have tens of outlets. As they grow, we grow with them.\"",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England was closer to the basement of the Bank than the rooftops when he complained last week that \"our biggest trading partner, the euro area, is tearing itself apart without any obvious solution\". The following day, David Cameron further endeared Britain to its partners across the channel with the admonition that the eurozone \"either has to make up or it is looking at a potential break- up.\" For Sir Mervyn, approaching his last year of office and speaking out even more, the problem is not \"eurozone survival good, eurozone collapse bad\", but the huge trading imbalances, balance of payments deficits, vast differences in competitiveness and still-defective European banking systems. \"The survival of the euro is not the problem,\" he said. What we are witnessing is a potentially cataclysmic conjuncture of the continuing crisis of modern finance capitalism and the inherent defects of the eurozone as originally conceived. There are many paradoxes and ironies about this crisis. The whole idea behind the European Union was to ensure that there were no more wars in Europe. Closely associated with this aim was the desire to avoid the levels of unemployment and social unrest that caused the rise of extremist rightwing political parties. (Does a day go by without a reference to Hitler in the press or on the radio?) In championing the exchange rate mechanism and then the eurozone, the French wanted to ensure that economic policy in Europe was not dominated by the Germans. Yet the latter continue to be more obsessed by folk memories of Weimar inflation than by the unemployment that led to extremism. This is a battle that has certainly not been won by the French \u2013 indeed, when my friend Jean-Claude Trichet became president of the European Central Bank, he was widely accused of having \"gone native\". The result of the French election shows that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is now being expected to take up the cudgels. Optimists \u2013 there are still some around \u2013 point to some apparent concessions by German policymakers on the subject of the asymmetry of eurozone economic policy. For instance, if southern members of the eurozone are ever going to narrow the gap in their price competitiveness with Germany, then the Germans should actively aim at a higher inflation rate. There is also wider recognition of the need for major infrastructure projects. My more leftwing friends are hoping that the turn of events not only in France but also in state elections in Germany heralds the beginning of something big. I wonder. With unemployment high, and a manifest deficiency of demand in the eurozone as well as the UK, there is still far too much emphasis by policymakers on structural reforms \u2013 in the workings of the labour market, for instance. The weakness of this approach was well captured many years ago by the economist James Tobin, he of the famous Tobin tax on financial transactions, much favoured by President Hollande. (Tobin, whom I had the privilege of meeting, had the distinction not only of winning a Nobel prize for economics, but also of having been the model for a character in Herman Wouk's The Caine Mutiny). Tobin wrote: \"Despite the dire science-fiction prophecies that accompany every period of high unemployment, revival of aggregate demand has always created jobs in numbers vastly beyond the imagination of the pessimists \u2026 Structural labour market policies can make only marginal improvements.\" Indeed, another distinguished prize-winning economist, our own Tony Atkinson, suggested at a conference organised by the Resolution Foundation thinktank last week that the way structural reforms have been introduced in the UK has had a perverse impact on job incentives. But let us return to those imbalances. The irony here is that the European Monetary System (EMS), the precursor of the euro, was set up to provide \"a zone of monetary stability\" after the breakup of the old Bretton Woods system in 1971-73 had led to a period of widely fluctuating exchange rates. But whereas the Bretton Woods system was one of fixed but adjustable exchange rates, under the single currency there is no adjustability other than painfully slow attempts to reduce costs in economies that have become uncompetitive vis-a-vis Germany. There was a time when, under the auspices of the OECD, various \"working parties\" of officials would analyse events and recommend adjustments to countries' economic policies, including towards exchange rates. But in those days costs were seldom as out of line as they have become within the eurozone. The good news is that thanks to Sir John Major's opt-out, and Gordon Brown's refusal to opt in, the British economy has been able to adjust its exchange rate. The bad news is that, as the prime minister and chancellor keep telling us, we may be badly hit by an implosion of our main export market anyway \u2013 although less badly than if we had signed up to the euro. But the government is being disingenuous in blaming all our current economic problems on the eurozone: George Osborne has made a significant contribution via his excessively deflationary policies.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Zuckerberg status update: richer than George Soros. When the closing bell rang at the end of Facebook's first day on New York's Nasdaq stock exchange, its founder was worth $19.4bn (\u00a312.2bn). The Wall Street analysts whose job it is to build logical arguments about why the online equivalent of a school reunion should have a market value of $104bn have torn up their financial models. The lacklustre trading performance on day one suggests Facebook's share price may have peaked before it floated, but Friday's initial public offering was not about putting a price on a company. Those who did buy into the stock were paying for a slice of American history. The dotcom crash that marked the beginning of this digital century left no room for celebrating the transformational power of the internet, but with Zuckerberg jumping on stage the party has resumed. Silicon Valley's figureheads are more than rich business people. In hoodies and jeans, avoiding taxes and regulators and delivering free and unlimited access to the world's information (and its music and films), the digital entrepreneurs running Amazon, Apple and Facebook have become the new folk heroes. They are the agents of social upheaval, a role once played by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

Seriously, this is not a joke \u2013 although the very idea may be making your sides split. After all, this is a bank that riles its shareholders with a pay policy that allowed its chief executive, Bob Diamond, to take home \u00a317m in 2011 \u2013 in a year that he himself deemed \"unacceptable\".

Replace \"take longer\" with \"be impossible\" and it becomes a statement that is easy to agree with. Posen bows out Fancy earning \u00a3101,000 for a three-day week? You'll need a firm grasp of the economy, and a fine turn of phrase to explain to the hard-pressed British public why the economy is still flat on its back. The Treasury is about to advertise the job of independent member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, after the American Adam Posen decided not to serve a second three-year term. Posen told the Observer in 2011 that he wouldn't stay on if his pessimistic view about the state of the economy, and his expectation that inflation would fall sharply, was proved wrong. So far, he's been half right: his colleagues finally joined him in approving more QE last autumn, as the economy slipped back into recession, but inflation remains way above the 1.5% he was expecting by mid-2012. Still, Posen should return to Washington with his head held high: his record is not perfect, but he was a lot more right than the MPC members who believed until last summer that the best medicine for Britain's flatlining economy was a rate rise.",
