    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "\u2018Performance bonds\u2019 would pay out over time if there was no misconduct \u2013 avoiding EU\u2019s financially illiterate bonus cap", 
      "body": "<p>Mark Carney is right: in the great quest to improve bankers\u2019 behaviour and stop the scandals, large fines for banks are not achieving much. He\u2019s also correct when he says it\u2019s not a case of a few rotten apples. We\u2019ve had PPI, Libor, forex and all the rest. The problem is probably the barrels.</p> <p>The Bank of England governor\u2019s latest idea to improve matters is borrowed from Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve. The proposal is to put a portion of bankers\u2019 salaries, not just their bonuses, at risk. Some staff would receive \u201cperformance bonds\u201d in place of part of their salaries. These would pay out over time if all went swimmingly but could be surrendered if misconduct were revealed later. Carney called it \u201ca potentially elegant solution\u201d.</p> <p>By that, he means it is a logical response to the EU\u2019s inelegant (and financially illiterate) bonus cap, which has made a bad situation worse. Banks, entirely predictably, have responded by cranking up salaries, thereby reducing the scope for cash to be clawed back.</p> <p>\u201cPerformance bonds\u201d would add to the complexity in senior bankers\u2019 pay arrangements. The senior folk already have salaries, bonuses and now \u201callowances\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s before one counts the long-term share-based carrots. But the principle is sound. If the EU \u2013 ridiculously \u2013 is shoving up salaries, intelligent regulators should row in the opposite direction by ensuring more pay can be retrieved when scandal strikes.</p> <p>Carney should ignore the inevitable squeals from banks that seven- and 10-year deferral periods already make it hard to recruit staff. The succession of scandals has demonstrated that it can take that long for regulators to uncover wrongdoing. There is nothing wrong with making a few highly paid bankers wait for their rewards.</p> <p>Carney is on to something. If the design is robust, \u201cperformance bonds\u201d could be a small advance in accountability.</p> <h2>Aim\u2019s silly convention</h2> <p>There goes another 19% from Quindell\u2019s share price. This is the outfit listed on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim), which wants to \u201crevolutionise the insurance industry\u201d but is instead providing a hard lesson in investing for its legion of small shareholders. Since April the stock has crashed from 660p to 55p.</p> <p>The latest development at least provides an excuse for regulators to take a look. It turns out that Canaccord Genuity, Quindell\u2019s joint broker, gave notice of its resignation on 21 October. Quindell sat on the news until yesterday because the convention on Aim, apparently, is to delay announcement until a resignation is effective.</p> <p>The convention is silly. Aim is at the less regulated end of the London market, thus the unexplained resignation of a City broker can be a major event. The convention may still be viewed as harmless if nothing of significance happens between the receipt of a broker\u2019s resignation and its announcement. The problem at Quindell is that interesting announcements come thick and fast.</p> <p>For example, on 5 November \u2013 two weeks after Canaccord Genuity\u2019s letter of resignation \u2013 Quindell\u2019s chairman, Rob Terry, and two colleagues sold \u00a39m of the company\u2019s shares via a \u201cshare and repurchase\u201d deal with an outside financing house called Equities First. Only some of the planned repurchases have been completed and accurate details about the arrangement with Equities First were conveyed by Quindell only at the second attempt.</p> <p>Were those share deals legitimate given that other shareholders had yet to be told that Canaccord had quit? Answers, please, London Stock Exchange \u2013 and quickly.</p> <h2>Serco chief had to go</h2> <p>Alastair Lyons\u2019 resignation as chairman of Serco was inevitable after the company\u2019s confession last week to \u201cstrategic and operational mis-steps\u201d. Lyons was chairman from 2010 so, as he says, \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d lies at his door.</p> <p>If we\u2019re being generous, Lyons made a decent start in mopping up the mess.

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney is right: in the great quest to improve bankers\u2019 behaviour and stop the scandals, large fines for banks are not achieving much. He\u2019s also correct when he says it\u2019s not a case of a few rotten apples. We\u2019ve had PPI, Libor, forex and all the rest. The problem is probably the barrels. The Bank of England governor\u2019s latest idea to improve matters is borrowed from Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve. The proposal is to put a portion of bankers\u2019 salaries, not just their bonuses, at risk. Some staff would receive \u201cperformance bonds\u201d in place of part of their salaries. These would pay out over time if all went swimmingly but could be surrendered if misconduct were revealed later. Carney called it \u201ca potentially elegant solution\u201d. By that, he means it is a logical response to the EU\u2019s inelegant (and financially illiterate) bonus cap, which has made a bad situation worse. Banks, entirely predictably, have responded by cranking up salaries, thereby reducing the scope for cash to be clawed back. \u201cPerformance bonds\u201d would add to the complexity in senior bankers\u2019 pay arrangements. The senior folk already have salaries, bonuses and now \u201callowances\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s before one counts the long-term share-based carrots. But the principle is sound. If the EU \u2013 ridiculously \u2013 is shoving up salaries, intelligent regulators should row in the opposite direction by ensuring more pay can be retrieved when scandal strikes. Carney should ignore the inevitable squeals from banks that seven- and 10-year deferral periods already make it hard to recruit staff. The succession of scandals has demonstrated that it can take that long for regulators to uncover wrongdoing. There is nothing wrong with making a few highly paid bankers wait for their rewards. Carney is on to something. If the design is robust, \u201cperformance bonds\u201d could be a small advance in accountability. Aim\u2019s silly convention There goes another 19% from Quindell\u2019s share price. This is the outfit listed on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim), which wants to \u201crevolutionise the insurance industry\u201d but is instead providing a hard lesson in investing for its legion of small shareholders. Since April the stock has crashed from 660p to 55p. The latest development at least provides an excuse for regulators to take a look. It turns out that Canaccord Genuity, Quindell\u2019s joint broker, gave notice of its resignation on 21 October. Quindell sat on the news until yesterday because the convention on Aim, apparently, is to delay announcement until a resignation is effective. The convention is silly. Aim is at the less regulated end of the London market, thus the unexplained resignation of a City broker can be a major event. The convention may still be viewed as harmless if nothing of significance happens between the receipt of a broker\u2019s resignation and its announcement. The problem at Quindell is that interesting announcements come thick and fast. For example, on 5 November \u2013 two weeks after Canaccord Genuity\u2019s letter of resignation \u2013 Quindell\u2019s chairman, Rob Terry, and two colleagues sold \u00a39m of the company\u2019s shares via a \u201cshare and repurchase\u201d deal with an outside financing house called Equities First. Only some of the planned repurchases have been completed and accurate details about the arrangement with Equities First were conveyed by Quindell only at the second attempt. Were those share deals legitimate given that other shareholders had yet to be told that Canaccord had quit? Answers, please, London Stock Exchange \u2013 and quickly. Serco chief had to go Alastair Lyons\u2019 resignation as chairman of Serco was inevitable after the company\u2019s confession last week to \u201cstrategic and operational mis-steps\u201d. Lyons was chairman from 2010 so, as he says, \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d lies at his door. If we\u2019re being generous, Lyons made a decent start in mopping up the mess. Unlike G4S\u2019s bosses, who appeared initially to resent government scrutiny, the board at Serco understood immediately the company didn\u2019t have a future unless it could repair relations with its biggest customer. Lyons dispatched its chief executive, Christopher Hyman, and found a good replacement in Rupert Soames. Hyman deserves the bulk of the criticism. He was the mastermind behind Serco\u2019s over-expansion and it was his boasts about Serco\u2019s ethical superiority that were shown to be self-satisfied guff.

      "bodyText": "UK trade to the EU Ambitious plans for Britain to export its way out of trouble have foundered. The message from David Cameron was that Britain, which exports a third of its output, can expect to see little improvement in the next few years. In fact things might get much worse. Fostering an export boom was a central plank of government policy following the banking crash, when a fall in the value of the pound was supposed to further help booming demand for British goods in all parts of the world. Sterling did indeed drop by a quarter, but Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the EU has become increasingly negative. We are importing more and exporting less. For a time an improvement in exports to south America, China and the emerging economies of Asia made up for some of the worsening figures from Europe. That came to an end earlier this year as several emerging economies began to falter. Eurozone GDP Gridlock in Brussels has prevented Europe\u2019s largest nations from firing up their economies to boost growth and leave the crisis behind. Germany, France and Italy were quick to recover from the banking crash of 2008, but have struggled to gain any momentum. A sovereign debt crisis in Greece in 2010 that spread to Spain in 2012 undermined the recovery in the region\u2019s banking sector. The word economist\u2019s increasingly use to describe the situation is stagnation. This year has been marked by increasingly strident debates over how much the European Central Bank (ECB) should join the Bank of England, US Federal Reserve and Japan\u2019s central bank in pumping trillions of euros into the financial system to reduce the cost of credit and spur lending. Germany wants the ECB to keep its powder dry, claiming cheap credit will lead to rampant inflation. Critics say that without an injection of funds, business confidence will wane further as inflation falls below zero and unemployment rises again. Eurozone unemployment and inflation The high jobless count has proved difficult to bring down in France and Italy. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialist administration has sought to bring the unemployment rate below 10%, only to see it stay in double digits and hit a record of 3.43m. In Italy, the broad jobless rate is 12.5%, just above the eurozone average, but officials in Rome are wrestling with a youth unemployment rate of 44%. The country\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, promised his \u201cJobs Act\u201d would kickstart Italy\u2019s economy and attract foreign investors, but Brussels has frowned on his spending proposals and unions are upset that he wants to make it easier for companies to fire people. Fearful of the future, eurozone consumers have stayed away from the shops, and with the situation still fragile businesses have delayed investment. One effect has been to drive the inflation rate down close to zero. Prices rose a little last month, but not enough to indicate that consumer demand has returned. China\u2019s GDP The extent to which China\u2019s booming economy has been propping up the rest of the region, plus Brazil, Russia and Germany has become obvious in the last year. Beijing exported work and jobs as manufacturing became increasingly interconnected. It imported huge amounts of energy from Russia and food from Brazil, and machine tools and cars from Germany. To overcome weak demand from Europe and elsewhere, the Chinese authorities allowed state enterprises to borrow vast sums for investment spending. To head off a debt-fuelled crash, Beijing has restricted the flow of credit, so much so that the official growth rate of 7.1% could translate to more like five to 5.5% in reality. Many economists believe this would not be enough to keep the growing population in work. Japan\u2019s GDP Japan appeared to recover from the 2011 tsunami under the guiding hand of the country\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. His \u201cthree arrows\u201d of reform \u2013 higher government spending, cheaper credit and shaking up old-fashioned business practices \u2013 appeared to be working. Government spending put more money in people\u2019s pockets and they spent rather than saved. This pushed up inflation above zero. Cheap credit also helped and discouraged saving, weakening the currency. Reforms, however, have proved more problematic and an ill-timed rise in VAT earlier this year discouraged spending. Now Tokyo is staring at a decline in growth. To reboot his policies, Abe is considering calling a snap election. Oil price Oil prices have proved a reliable bellwether for the health of the world economy. Since dropping below $50 a barrel after the financial crash, it has mostly stayed above $100. This illustrated the strength of the global recovery, but in the summer Brent crude prices reacted to the fall in China\u2019s growth and slowing growth elsewhere. On Monday it fetched less than $79. The US would in times past have picked up the slack in demand. The world\u2019s biggest economy is growing at between 2% and 3% a year and demand for energy is picking up. The difference with just a few years ago, however, is that the US is edging closer to self-sufficiency in oil and gas. Such is the shale gas, or fracking, revolution that there are concerns Washington is in league with Saudi Arabia to drive down the price for the purpose of bringing Russia and Iran to heel.",

Power, like nature, abhors a vacuum. The search for the new kind of CEO is on. <br></p> <p>The \u201cboardroom liberal\u201d may be the new catchword for a successful leader. <br></p> <p>Boardroom liberal is the appealing new phrase that made its debut in last week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120170/valerie-jarrett-obama-whisperer\">New Republic</a> feature on the role played by White House advisor Valerie Jarrett. <br></p> <p>The article\u2019s author, Noam Scheiber, defined the boardroom liberal as the progressive CEO of many liberal\u2019s dreams. \u201cIt\u2019s a worldview that\u2019s steeped in social progressivism, in the values of tolerance and diversity,\u201d Scheiber writes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b62c77ac87a4589b5126b16f9b911ef844f43d3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/17/1416249414871/e76b8997-2559-402a-9faf-d54eca2cf2b2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jamie Dimon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robin Hood disguised as CEO: JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then the snark emerges. <br></p> <p>The picture of a boardroom liberal, you see, \u201cis a corporate CEO handing a refrigerator-sized check to the head of a charity at a celebrity golf tournament. All the better if they\u2019re surrounded by minority children and struggling moms.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, if the imperial CEO has exited stage left, this new kind of CEO has entered stage right, and the main thing he has learned is to master the <em>optics</em>.</p> <p> Like Bill Gates, these current and former CEOs are philanthropists on a scale the world has never witnessed before. Or, like Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, they\u2019re in training to take on that role. (Zuckerberg earned the title of the country\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/mark-zuckerberg-leads-list-philanthropists-2013-article-1.1608557\">most generous philanthropist</a> last year.) Even those who firmly own their capitalism, like Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan or Jeff Immelt of General Electric, make sure to be conspicuous about their good works. Dimon drove JP Morgan to invest in businesses in Detroit, and Immelt headed Obama\u2019s now-disbanded jobs council of CEOs, devoted to <a href=\"http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/in-the-news/obama-picks-jeffrey-immelt-ge-ceo-run-new-jobs-focused-panel-ge-sends-jobs-overseas-pays\">finding a way to create jobs</a>. <br></p> <p>But even as the boardroom liberals use their power \u2013 from their wealth to the various kinds of clout that wealth has brought them \u2013 to transform the world for the better, they aren\u2019t really advocating any changes in the power structure.

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time, we had the imperial CEO to worry about: the business leader who ruled in the manner of Augustus over his corporate empire. Jack Welsh at GE. Lee Iacocca at Chrysler. Sam Palmisano at IBM. Like those emperors of yore, they made sweeping, unilateral decisions, cherished their celebrity perks and ran roughshod over their boards of directors, employees and shareholders. Think Home Depot\u2019s Ralph Nardelli, who set up giant timers at the company\u2019s annual meetings and refused to answer questions about his (lavish) pay, set by a (too cozy) compensation committee. The Home Depot board finally ousted Nardelli in 2007 after years of underperformance, leading some to declare an end to the imperial CEO trend. What, or who, comes next? Power, like nature, abhors a vacuum. The search for the new kind of CEO is on. The \u201cboardroom liberal\u201d may be the new catchword for a successful leader. Boardroom liberal is the appealing new phrase that made its debut in last week\u2019s New Republic feature on the role played by White House advisor Valerie Jarrett. The article\u2019s author, Noam Scheiber, defined the boardroom liberal as the progressive CEO of many liberal\u2019s dreams. \u201cIt\u2019s a worldview that\u2019s steeped in social progressivism, in the values of tolerance and diversity,\u201d Scheiber writes. Then the snark emerges. The picture of a boardroom liberal, you see, \u201cis a corporate CEO handing a refrigerator-sized check to the head of a charity at a celebrity golf tournament. All the better if they\u2019re surrounded by minority children and struggling moms.\u201d In other words, if the imperial CEO has exited stage left, this new kind of CEO has entered stage right, and the main thing he has learned is to master the optics. Like Bill Gates, these current and former CEOs are philanthropists on a scale the world has never witnessed before. Or, like Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, they\u2019re in training to take on that role. (Zuckerberg earned the title of the country\u2019s most generous philanthropist last year.) Even those who firmly own their capitalism, like Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan or Jeff Immelt of General Electric, make sure to be conspicuous about their good works. Dimon drove JP Morgan to invest in businesses in Detroit, and Immelt headed Obama\u2019s now-disbanded jobs council of CEOs, devoted to finding a way to create jobs. But even as the boardroom liberals use their power \u2013 from their wealth to the various kinds of clout that wealth has brought them \u2013 to transform the world for the better, they aren\u2019t really advocating any changes in the power structure. The levers of power stay firmly in the hands of the elite. There\u2019s just more noblesse oblige. It\u2019s not just the corporate do-gooders. Consider billionaire hedge fund managers as part of this trend, too. After all, the foundation of choice for those who toil in \u201cHedge Fund Alley\u201d in New York is the pointedly named Robin Hood Foundation, which throws one of the city\u2019s most lavish gala events every spring.

How liberal, really, are these boardroom liberals? Mind you, these are the same people who squawk, very loudly, at any suggestion that the fees they collect for managing their funds should be taxed as ordinary income, instead of as capital gains. They\u2019ve been fighting for years any suggestion that their primary source of income should be taxed at the same higher rates as those people whom their philanthropy helps.

She will succeed Alan Stewart, who quit in the summer to join Tesco, but Weir\u2019s appointment could leave M&amp;S without a finance chief for nearly a year while she completes a six-month notice period. Since July, Paul Friston, executive assistant to the M&amp;S chief executive, Marc Bolland, has been performing the role on an interim basis and will continue to do so. Weir is considered a City heavyweight, having spent nearly a decade at the B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher in senior finance roles before becoming finance director at Lloyds Banking Group in 2004. She led its retail division in 2008 but left in 2011 after missing out on the top job to Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio.

Weir is an interesting appointment for M&amp;S as in recent years John Lewis has been closing the sales gap with its larger rival.

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney: dock bankers' pay for misconduct", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has warned bankers they should lose more of their pay in cases of wrongdoing \u2013 in addition to forfeiting bonuses \u2013 after a series of fines for bad conduct have failed to improve standards across the scandal-hit industry. The Bank of England governor signalled a radical overhaul of the way bankers are paid as he told an audience in Singapore that repeated fines for scandals, such as manipulating Libor and last week\u2019s \u00a32.6bn penalties for rigging foreign exchange rates, were not enough to change behaviour. New measures were needed to restore the public\u2019s trust in the financial markets, Carney said, signalling that moves could include making bankers fund a bank\u2019s fines out of their pay or potentially docking salaries. \u201cThe repeated nature of these fines demonstrates that financial penalties [on banks] alone are not sufficient to address the issues raised,\u201d he said. \u201cFundamental change is needed to institutional culture, to compensation arrangements and to markets.\u201d He added that the succession of scandals \u201cmean it is simply untenable now to argue that the problem is one of a few bad apples. The issue is with the barrels in which they are stored.\u201d Policymakers have had bankers\u2019 pay in their sights since the 2008 crisis. They initially required bonuses to be paid in shares as well as cash and spread out over three to five years. This year the EU has stipulated that bonuses for senior bankers be capped at 100% of salary \u2013 or 200% with explicit approval from shareholders. This has prompted a rise in the use of \u201callowances\u201d, which are paid in addition to salary and bonuses to maintain bankers\u2019 pay levels. Europe\u2019s top banking regulator, however, has ruled that these arrangements breach the bonus cap. Carney said: \u201cIt is unfortunate, for example, that new European rules to cap bonuses to half, or with shareholder approval, two-thirds, of total pay have the undesirable side effect of limiting the scope for remuneration to be cut back. \u201cThis makes the case for additional reforms to ensure that the burden of excessive risk-taking and misconduct by staff can still be borne by those staff. Standards may need to be developed to put non-bonuses or fixed pay at risk. This could potentially be achieved through payment in instruments other than cash.\u201d He referred to an idea floated by the US central banker Bill Dudley to pay bankers partly in performance bonds, which he said \u201cis worthy of investigation as a potentially elegant solution\u201d. Dudley, who is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said such bonds could be used to pay fines, hitting bankers\u2019 rather than shareholders\u2019 pockets. Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, had warned the bonus cap could push up fixed pay - the element that Carney was now setting his sights on. Carney said the public\u2019s trust in the financial system \u201chas been severely tested by taxpayer bailouts of systemic institutions, rewards perceived as undeserved, a perception that clients have become counterparties and egregious examples of misconduct and rigging of markets\u201d. His remarks follow similar comments from his colleagues at the Bank. Last month, the deputy governor Nemat \u201cMinouche\u201d Shafik said the current fines for misconduct were \u201clike salt rubbed into the wounds to public confidence in financial markets\u201d. Her fellow deputy, Sir Jon Cunliffe, has also warned bankers to brace for pay cuts. Carney also pushed back against attempts by some bankers to argue against future reforms to the industry. \u201cAlready we can hear some of the runners, particularly those at the back, making world-weary arguments that more reform will hurt jobs and growth, and even that financial crises are just something that happens every five to seven years. If that were true, we are due for another crisis about now. Does anyone find that acceptable?\u201dCarney\u2019s remarks come as banks face scrutiny of plans to claw back bonuses following last week\u2019s fines for foreign exchange rigging. The BBC reported last night future payments to former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester were part of a review by the bank. There is no suggestion Hester, who left RBS last year, knew about any wrongdoing.",

      "body": "<p>Mark Carney has warned bankers they should lose more of their pay in cases of wrongdoing \u2013 in addition to forfeiting bonuses \u2013 after a series of fines for bad conduct have failed to improve standards across the scandal-hit industry.</p> <p>The Bank of England governor signalled a radical overhaul of the way bankers are paid as he told an audience in Singapore that repeated fines for scandals, such as manipulating Libor and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/12/foreign-exchange-fines-ubs-hsbc-citibank-jp-morgan-rbs-penalties-market-rigging\" title=\"\">last week\u2019s \u00a32.6bn penalties for rigging foreign exchange rates,</a> were not enough to change behaviour.</p> <p>New measures were needed to restore the public\u2019s trust in the financial markets, Carney said, signalling that moves could include making bankers fund a bank\u2019s fines out of their pay or potentially docking salaries.</p> <p>\u201cThe repeated nature of these fines demonstrates that financial penalties [on banks] alone are not sufficient to address the issues raised,\u201d he said. \u201cFundamental change is needed to institutional culture, to compensation arrangements and to markets.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the succession of scandals \u201cmean it is simply untenable now to argue that the problem is one of a few bad apples. The issue is with the barrels in which they are stored.\u201d</p> <p>Policymakers have had bankers\u2019 pay in their sights since the 2008 crisis. They initially required bonuses to be paid in shares as well as cash and spread out over three to five years. This year the EU has stipulated that bonuses for senior bankers be capped at 100% of salary \u2013 or 200% with explicit approval from shareholders.</p> <p>This has prompted a rise in the use of \u201callowances\u201d, which are paid in addition to salary and bonuses to maintain bankers\u2019 pay levels. Europe\u2019s top banking regulator, however, has ruled that these arrangements breach the bonus cap.</p> <p>Carney said: \u201cIt is unfortunate, for example, that new European rules to cap bonuses to half, or with shareholder approval, two-thirds, of total pay have the undesirable side effect of limiting the scope for remuneration to be cut back.</p> <p>\u201cThis makes the case for additional reforms to ensure that the burden of excessive risk-taking and misconduct by staff can still be borne by those staff. Standards may need to be developed to put non-bonuses or fixed pay at risk. This could potentially be achieved through payment in instruments other than cash.\u201d</p> <p>He referred to an idea floated by the US central banker Bill Dudley to pay bankers partly in performance bonds, which he said \u201cis worthy of investigation as a potentially elegant solution\u201d. Dudley, who is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said such bonds could be used to pay fines, hitting bankers\u2019 rather than shareholders\u2019 pockets.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, had warned the bonus cap could push up fixed pay - the element that Carney was now setting his sights on.</p> <p>Carney said the public\u2019s trust in the financial system \u201chas been severely tested by taxpayer bailouts of systemic institutions, rewards perceived as undeserved, a perception that clients have become counterparties and egregious examples of misconduct and rigging of markets\u201d.</p> <p>His remarks follow similar comments from his colleagues at the Bank. Last month, the deputy governor Nemat \u201cMinouche\u201d Shafik said the current fines for misconduct were \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/27/city-problems-undermining-public-trust-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">like salt rubbed into the wounds to public confidence in financial markets\u201d</a>. Her fellow deputy, Sir Jon Cunliffe, has also warned bankers to brace for pay cuts.</p> <p>Carney also pushed back against attempts by some bankers to argue against future reforms to the industry. \u201cAlready we can hear some of the runners, particularly those at the back, making world-weary arguments that more reform will hurt jobs and growth, and even that financial crises are just something that happens every five to seven years. If that were true, we are due for another crisis about now. Does anyone find that acceptable?\u201dCarney\u2019s remarks come as banks face scrutiny of plans to claw back bonuses following last week\u2019s fines for foreign exchange rigging.</p> <p>The BBC reported last night future payments to former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester were part of a review by the bank. There is no suggestion Hester, who left RBS last year, knew about any wrongdoing.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Mario Draghi says ECB could buy government bonds; Japanese recession weighs on markets \u2013 live", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all for today. Our summary of Mario Draghi\u2019s testimony to MEPs is here. And the lunchtime summary covers Japan\u2019s recession, the Bundesbank\u2019s gloomy growth forecasts, and Mark Carney\u2019s call for tougher restrictions on bankers pay. Back tomorrow.... Thanks all, and goodnight. GW Draghi\u2019s testimony even pushed shares a little higher in London, where the FTSE 100 just closed 17 points higher at 6671 points, a gain of 0.25%. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the ECB chief\u2019s talk of possibly buying government bonds \u2013 and a takeover offer for botox-maker Allergan \u2013 took traders\u2019 minds off the Japanese recession. Markets in Europe traded between gains and losses for most of the session on Monday as investors weighed up slightly better growth at home, renewed M&amp;A activity in the pharmaceutical sector against sharp growth contraction in Japan. It was only after a speech from Mario Draghi that markets found their footing thanks to the prospects of sovereign bond purchases from the ECB. The euro fell, and European stock markets rose, after Mario Draghi declared that: \u201cOther unconventional measures might entail the purchase of a variety of assets, one of which is government bonds.\u201d . The French CAC and the German DAX are both up around 0.7%, reversing the losses triggered by Japan\u2019s return to recession. The euro, though, has shed 0.6 of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.246. Draghi is now taking further questions, in his role as chairman of the European Systemic Risk Board. He\u2019s told MEPs that future bank stress tests should include the risk of fines for misconduct. It\u2019s being streamed here. OK, that\u2019s the end of Mario Draghi\u2019s testimony to the European Parliament in his role as president of the European Central Bank. A reminder of the key points from the last couple of hours. 1) Draghi has urged European leaders and policymakers to deliver \u201cconcrete\u201d short-term commitment for structural reforms in the member state, and to take steps towards long-term sharing of sovereignty to reinforce euro. He said: 2015 needs to be the year when all actors in the euro area, governments and European institutions alike, will deploy a consistent common strategy to bring our economies back on track. 2) The ECB chief denied that Greece will require debt restructuring, insisting that its borrowing is sustainable if Athens sticks to its targets. 3) Draghi gave a clear signal that the ECB could begin buying eurozone government debt if its existing stimulus measures don\u2019t bring inflation back to target. The governing council is unanimous in its commitment to unconventional measures, he insisted, which: \u201ccould include changes to the size and composition to the Eurosystem balance sheet, if warranted, to achieve price stability over the medium term.\u201d He then added: \u201cOther unconventional measures might entail the purchase of a variety of assets, one of which is government bonds,\u201d. 4) Draghi defended the euro, saying it is \u201cirreversible\u201d. He denied that the single currency caused the structural problems and weak growth in the eurozone. 5) But he remains concerned about the state of the eurozone economy, saying current growth rates are dismal, and unemployment still too high. 6) And Draghi refused to accept that the ECB forced Ireland into applying for a bailout in 2010.....and also ruled out being a \u2018formal\u2019 part of Ireland\u2019s bailout. Draghi bursts into Italian, to answer a question about banking supervision. Then he apologises for yielding to his natural instincts. Ever the pro, Draghi then translates his answer into English, (for the benefit of any ignorant Brits tuning in). Eurozone banks have been tested robustly, and most passed our tests. But if problems arise in future, then the supervisory board will pick it up and deal with it, he says. Draghi repeats that the ECB is committed to doing everything within its mandate, and wants people to understand that it is ready to act if more unconventional measures are needed. Another Irish MEP asks whether Draghi will take part in Ireland\u2019s inquiry into its bailout, will he make a senior official responsible to liaise with the inquiry, and will it release any necessary documents to help the inquiry? Surely you agree, Mr Draghi, that the ECB should be accountable to the public. An Irish inquiry without the ECB would be like Hamlet without the prince. Draghi agrees that the ECB must be accountable to the people, and indeed it already is, through this committee. So it won\u2019t take a formal role in the inquiry \u2013 we might participate informally, but we haven\u2019t decided yet. And it won\u2019t appoint a \u2018point-person\u2019 to help the inquiry. Not terribly helpful, frankly. The euro area must grow more, Draghi insists. Europe\u2019s current economic performance is \u201cdismal\u201d, and the jobless levels - particularly for young people- is unacceptably high. But he denies that the euro is the cause of this malaise -- look, most of the countries in the eurozone grew in the last quarter. Only two saw their economies shrink. The eurozone must also \u201cmove from rules to institutions\u201d, Draghi concludes, but he won\u2019t say any more because it\u2019s not in his remit. Governments must deliver structural reforms even if they mean changing the way that countries have run for a long time, Draghi says. And he claims that many eurozone members had lost monetary sovereignty long before the creation of the euro. Now they share sovereignty. Will the ECB\u2019s new asset-backed securities programme turn it into a bad bank? NO, Draghi insists. He explains that the default rates between US ABS products (which often comprises sub-prime loans) is much, much higher than the ABS products which the ECB will buy. And we will only buy the senior tranches of some ABS products -- to call the ECB a bad bank is not right, to say the least. Furthermore, we will only buy mezzanine levels (the \u2018riskier\u2019 stuff), if there is a government guarantee. Draghi says the ECB welcomes the new capital market union that was recently proposed by the EU\u2019s president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Here\u2019s the quote from Draghi, confirming that the ECB could potentially start buying government bonds: Draghi causes a little stir by saying that the ECB could potentially start buying sovereign debt, if necessary. But he also defends the decisions taken so far - saying the ECB\u2019s monetary policy has been \u201cextraordinarily successful in reducing interest rates\u201d. Some are even lower than in the United States, even without resorting to quantitative easing. Reminder -- the bottom line is that the ECB will do everything possible within its mandate... A German MEP queries the measures take by the ECB recently - is everything really ok? Draghi replies that the measures taken since June (such as starting to buy asset-backed securities), should have a positive effect. But the governing council is committed to taking further unconventional measures if needed. It\u2019s all about hitting our mandate of inflation close to, but below 2%, he smiles. Drink! He was answering a question on whether member states may leave the euro - we don\u2019t have the legal power to keep members in, but our position, as we\u2019ve said before, is that the euro is irreversible. Draghi ducks a question about the LuxLeaks scandal - saying the ECB does not, yet anyway, have authority over taxation in Europe. Another MEP who asks under what authority the ECB had instructed Dublin to seek a bailout in 2010. Draghi tries to slap him down -- don\u2019t you think the ECB should act in the interest of all member states, including those who have been helping Ireland? To get up to speed on the Irish letters, check out this piece in the Economist. It explains how Jean-Claude Trichet made an \u201cimperious\u201d demand that Ireland should seek a bailout, else the ECB would withdraw its support for the Irish banking sector. What particularly sticks in the Irish craw is Mr Trichet\u2019s imperious tone. His letter makes four demands: Ireland must request financial support from the Eurogroup (euro-zone finance ministers); the request must include a commitment to austerity, structural reforms and a clean-up of the banking sector; recapitalisation of banks; and a guarantee of the repayment of ELA funds. A series of questions about Ireland\u2019s bailout in 2010, the decision to release letters between Draghi\u2019s predecessor Jean-Claude Trichet, and the ECB\u2019s advise that Ireland should not \u2018burn\u2019 senior bondholders. Draghi replies that it wasn\u2019t the ECB\u2019s fault that Ireland took a bailout. Instead, it was the government\u2019s decision to guarantee bank losses, the sheer scale of the domestic crisis, aggravating external factors, and the loss of market confidence that made a bailout inevitable. It\u2019s not just about the letters, he insists. The eurosystem also provided huge support to Ireland\u2019s banks in the run-up to the bailout. But there are limits... And the governing council had a duty to consider the deteriorating situation in Ireland, which prompted the letter from Trichet. Another question: Would an ECB quantitative easing programme deter countries from implementing structural reforms, or from using the fiscal headroom available to them? [a hint about Germany and its reluctance to borrow more to stimulate growth] Draghi denies that eurozone countries have been deterred from taking action because they have been showered with money, or because interest rates are very low or very high. A question about whether Greece needs debt restructuring. If Greece stays on course and hits its commitments, its debt will remain sustainable, Mario Draghi replies. We don\u2019t think a debt restructuring is needed, and we don\u2019t think it would be useful. Greece must focus on the need for further reforms to deliver competitiveness - we can see that the work it has implemented is paying off. And he insists that the ECB has not made a profit on the Greek bailout - those profits were returned. Asked about the need for structural reforms, Draghi says that they aren\u2019t the only answer. But, \u201cwe now see that the countries that are growing faster are the ones where some structural reforms have taken place\u201d. GDP data released on Friday showed Spain and Greece both growing, but Italy entering another recession. Mario Draghi concludes with a loud call to arms to the European parliament, and to politicians and central bankers across the eurozone. He declares that: 2014 has been a year of profound change, but what has been achieved so far is not enough. 2015 needs to be the year when all actors in the euro area, governments and European institutions alike, will deploy a consistent common strategy to bring our economies back on track. Monetary policy alone will not be able to achieve this. This is why there is an urgent need to agree on a concrete short-term commitment for structural reforms in the member states, on a consequent application of the stability and growth pact....on the aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area, and on a strategy for investment.... ....and to launch work on a long-term vision to further share sovereignty, ensuring the sustainable and smooth functioning of the European Monetary Union. Draghi\u2019s now taking questions; I\u2019ll keep an eye for any fireworks. Now Draghi is talking about how the ECB provides liquidity to banks by offering them credit in return for collateral (various financial assets). He is trying to reassure MEPS that these activities have a good track record. The eurosystem has never made a loss through these collateral programme -- in the rare cases of a financial crisis, the ECB recovered its collateral by seizing the underlying assets that banks had placed with it. Draghi moves onto a reminder that monetary policy can\u2019t do everything itself. National governments must act too, and implement structural reforms Mario Draghi repeats some key news lines from the ECB\u2019s most recent governing council meeting -- the GC is unanimously committed to expanding its balance sheet towards 2012 levels, and has tasked staff to develop further measures if needed. Draghi says the ECB can see early indications that its credit easing package is delivering tangible benefits, but a full recovery will take some time. Credit market fragmentation has made it harder for the ECB to fulfil its mandate, Draghi says. Some markets have improved recently, but other credit markets are still impaired. So overall credit availability is still tight on a historical basis. And some banks are failing to fully pass the improvements in credit availability onto customers, he warns. Draghi tells the committee that the ECB still expects a moderate pick-up in growth next year. But, euro area growth momentum did weaken over the summer. And the risks to the economic outlook continue to be to the downside. This chimes with his statement at the ECB\u2019s most recent monthly press conference, two weeks ago. Mario Draghi begins by telling MEPs that 2014 has been a year of profound change. He cites the changes to the way eurozone banks are supervised and regulated. He also says that 2014 was \u201ca challenging year for monetary policy\u201d, which saw the ECB takes a number of measures to address an increasingly sobering financial landscape. Mario Draghi\u2019s testimony at the European Parliament is just starting now.... (livefeed here) Capital Economics reckons the Japanese yen will weaken sharply in 2015, from around \u00a5116 to the $1 today to \u00a5140 next year. Over in Greece, demonstrators marking the 1973 Athens Polytechnic uprising \u2013 the event that triggered the fall of seven years of hated military dictatorship the following year \u2013 are amassing in the Greek capital. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: 7000 police, many in riot gear, have been deployed around the centre of Athens following clashes last week in the run-up to the anniversary. Protesters, who blame swingeing EU-IMF mandated austerity cuts for plummeting living standards and problems in the education system, will stage a march to the US embassy this afternoon. Washington is widely blamed for backing the military dictatorship which sent in tanks to crush the student revolt, killing dozens in the process. The protests come three days after Greece officially returned to growth, and amid confusion over how it will exit its bailout package. Tensions are running high as despondency grows with Greece\u2019s governing coalition. Panos Garganas, a veteran leftist mingling with the crowd gathered outside the Polytechnic, explains: \u201cIt is quite clear that despite all the talk of success the economy has seized up and the government is in no position to leave the bailout program and go out to the markets,\u201d \u201cWe are essentially in a pre-election period. A new government will have to negotiate with creditors when elections are held early next year, which everyone believes.\u201d Heads-up: Mario Draghi, ECB chief, will begin testifying to the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. in 10 minutes. It\u2019ll be livestreamed here. Time for a recap. Japan\u2019s stock market has suffered its biggest fall in three months, as the unexpected news that the country is back in recession spooked the Tokyo stock market. The yen also crashed into a new seven year low after Japanese GDP shrank at an annual rate of 1.6%. Economists blamed the government\u2019s decision to raise the sales tax this year, and its plan for a second hike in 2015. Reaction starts here European markets have now recovered their earlier losses, as speculation grows that prime minister Shinzo Abe will tomorrow announce a snap general election and postpone the sales tax in increase until 2016. The disappointing data came hours after David Cameron cautioned that risks in the global economy are growing. Chancellor George Osborne repeated that warning today. Japan\u2019s surprise slide into recession has shown the limits of monetary policy in fighting the country\u2019s economic malaise, says Stephen Lewis of ADM Investor Services: The truth that emerges clearly from Japan\u2019s experience so far this year is that fiscal policy nowadays exerts a much more powerful effect than monetary policy. The BoJ\u2019s unprecedented efforts, injecting liquidity through its QQE policy, have left Japan\u2019s economy still slumping while consumer price inflation, stripping out the effects of the sales tax increase, is beginning to slip, despite households\u2019 expectation that it is on a solid rising trend. The effects of monetary policy are hard to trace while the effects of April\u2019s fiscal adjustment are plain to see. In other news.... The Bundesbank has predicted that the German economy will be sluggish for at least the next few months. Its president, Jens Weidmann, has also hit out at calls for QE in the eurozone. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has called for tighter controls on bankers\u2019 remuneration, including new clawback powers on basic pay.... ....as the BoE\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, hints that falling UK inflation expectations means interest rates will stay low for longer. Europe\u2019s trade surplus has grown again, as has Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the eurozone. Delaying the planned sales tax hike would help Japan achieve \u2018escape velocity\u2019 levels of growth, according to Jesper Koll of JP Morgan (speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago) And this chart shows how Japan\u2019s economy has struggled since the financial crisis began, with growth lagging behind the US, Germany, Britain and (even) France. Japan\u2019s slide into recession is worryingly reminiscent of 1997. Then, the Hashimoto government decided to raise the sales tax in an attempt to rebuild the country\u2019s fiscal position. But the move may have backfired -- a strong-looking recovery was snuffed out and Japan fell into an 18-month long recession. It\u2019s hard to pin all the blame on the sales tax hike -- 1997 was also the year of the Asian currency crisis. But it\u2019s a reminder of the difficulty in turning Japan\u2019s economy around over the last 20 years. Over in Rochester, Kent, the UK chancellor George Osborne has repeated David Cameron\u2019s warning that the eurozone is a threat to the UK: Osborne is campaigning ahead of Thursday\u2019s by-election, which could well be won by UKIP. Our politics live-blogger Andy Sparrow has all the details: Rochester byelection hustings: Politics Live blog For an alternative take on Germany, check out Wolfgang Munchau in the Financial Times today. Munchau argues that German economists and politicians are hamstrung by their devotion to the \u201cordoliberal\u201d policies that emerged from the trauma of the 1920s and 1930s. In short, the belief that governments must set and enforce rules, not just fix the damage when they are broken. That\u2019s not easily compatible with monetary union with other countries. Here\u2019s a flavour: The ordoliberal doctrine may even have worked well for Germany, though I suspect that the country\u2019s economic success is due mostly to technology, high skills and the presence of some excellent companies, rather than to economic policy. Through its dominance of the euro system, Germany is exporting ordoliberal ideology to the rest of the single currency bloc. It is hard to think of a doctrine that is more ill suited to a monetary union with such diverse legal traditions, political system and economic conditions than this one. And it is equally hard to see Germany ever giving up on this. As a result the economic costs of crisis resolution will be extremely large. Full piece here (behind the FT paywall). The Bundesbank\u2019s chief, Jens Weidmann, has also attacked the idea that the European Central Bank should embark on a larger stimulus programme. He told the Handelsblatt newspaper that the ECB should resist pressure for a full-blown quantitative easing programme (buying sovereign debt with new money). He argued: \u201cSuch purchases might create new incentives to run up debt, besides adding to the reform fatigue in a number of countries.\u201d Business Insider has a good take. Meanwhile in Germany, the Bundesbank has warned that economic growth in Europe\u2019s largest economy will remain weak for the next few months. In its latest monthly report, the German central bank says: \u201cThe further deterioration in economic expectations and the stagnation of new orders point to a rather sluggish course of economic development in Germany until at least the end of 2014.\u201d And the rest of Europe is little better: \u201cNo marked recovery in important euro-area partner countries has yet materialised.\u201d Some economists argue that Germany should respond to this stagnation by raising government spending, rather than insisting on achieving a balanced budget. The Bundesbank knows better, though, arguing: \u201cAn additional, debt-financed economic package...would not be constructive for the economic situation in Germany, or the comparatively meagre stimuli it is expected to give to the rest of the euro zone,\u201d the Bundesbank said in its monthly report. \u201cIn view of the considerable uncertainty surrounding the global and European economy, it seems appropriate for the moment to continue in the fiscal direction laid out in previous planning.\u201d Disagree? Check out the full report here (in German) Banking analyst Ralph Silva has applauded Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s proposal that bankers\u2019 fixed pay should be clawback-able (see 9.01am post for details). The mood in the financial markets has also been dented by the events at the G20 summit in Brisbane last weekend, where Vladimir Putin faced the unhappiness of fellow world leaders over the Ukraine crisis. As IG\u2019s Alastair McCaig explains: Rather than the plethora of sound bite-friendly empty promises that we have become accustomed to, the focus was disproportionately on sanctions against G20 member Russia. Japan\u2019s recession has added to those concerns: Japan\u2019s problems are far greater than markets had assumed and the likelihood of snap elections has taken a step closer. Vladimir Putin\u2019s presence and early departure from this weekend\u2019s latest G20 summit ensured that sentiment was already frosty before this disappointment. With Abenomics looking ropey, Japan\u2019s prime minister may be tempted to unleash more fiscal firepower to drive the economy back to growth. But Japan\u2019s precarious financial position doesn\u2019t give Shinzo Abe much freedom. Especially as the unpopular sales tax hike - now to be postponed - was designed to show that Tokyo was serious about tackling its huge debt pile. Fung Siu, Japan analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, says the Bank of Japan will need to maintain its bold stimulus packages: The government will be keen to draft a fiscal stimulus package, but given the precarious state of the public finances--there isn\u2019t much room for maneouvre here and any package is unlikely to match the size of the previous supplementary budget (implemented in January 2014). The weak data are a major setback for the BOJ and it now might take even longer for it to meet its inflation target of 2%, meaning that it is unlikely to end its ultra-loose monetary policy any time soon. Back to the news that Japan is in recession, after GDP shrank by another 0.4% in the third quarter of the year. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst for Caxton FX, reckons that the yen is likely to weaken further. With the Yen already in a weakened position after a surprise round of monetary stimulus announced very recently, this could cause the world\u2019s third most traded currency to crumble further. This poor GDP reading is likely to have a detrimental effect on stock markets in Asia and have a ripple effect on equity markets abroad. However, stock markets should be cushioned by the fact that Friday\u2019s eurozone GDP data was better than feared (Germany avoided recession). Although Japan officially now falls into the definition of a recessionary period (two consecutive quarters of economic contraction), it seems unlikely that this would cause a steep global equity downturn for more than a few days. Just in...... the eurozone\u2019s trade surplus has doubled month-on month. Latest data from Eurostat show that the eurozone\u2019s trade in goods with the rest of the world jumped to \u20ac18.5bn in September, up from \u20ac8.6bn in August and \u20ac10.8bn in September 2013. Exports rose by 4.2% month-on-month, while imports rose by just 3.0%. But Britain\u2019s trade gap with the euro area has widened this year, suggesting the weak euro economy and stronger pound are hitting British companies. In the first eight months of 2014, eurozone countries exported 7% more goods to the UK than a year ago, but imported 3% less. Eurozone exports to China are also up by 7% between January and August, but exports to Russia are down 15% as sanctions take their toll. This chart has more details: Eurostat also reports that Germany has the biggest trade surplus of any European Union member, and Britain the biggest deficit. The largest surplus was observed in Germany (+\u20ac138.8bn in January-August 2014), followed by the Netherlands (+\u20ac38.5bn), Italy (+\u20ac26.2bn), Ireland (+\u20ac23.2bn) and the Czech Republic (+\u20ac10.8bn). The United Kingdom (-\u20ac89.8 bn) registered the largest deficit, followed by France (-\u20ac49.3 bn), Spain (-\u20ac16.6 bn) and Greece (-\u20ac13.6 bn). Andy Haldane isn\u2019t the only person feeling dovish about UK interest rates: When it comes to crisp wordplay and biting insights, it\u2019s hard to beat a speech from Andy Haldane. And Haldane fans will be pleased to hear that the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has spoken about central bank psychology, in London this morning. He begins by reminding the audience that the BoE was holding a conference on the \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d on 13 September 2007, the day when Northern Rock began to implode as the wheels came off the financial system. As Haldane put it: As Great Recession abruptly replaced Great Moderation, it was clear a grave analytical and policy error had been made. Economic and financial pride had come before a momentous fall. Nemesis had duly followed hubris. It was the coldest of comforts that this cognitive lapse was shared by the whole economic and policy-making profession. He goes on to warn that economists, like any collective, can be guilty of groupthink -- looking for evidence that confirms past beliefs. This, rather than alcohol, is why drunks search for lost keys under the lamppost. The broad sweep of Haldane\u2019s speech is that he\u2019s shaking up the Bank of England\u2019s forecasting unit to help it understand its biases and learn from its mistakes. But he also hints that he is far from ready to vote for an interest rate hike, as there are signs that UK households expect inflation to be lower in the months ahead. Here\u2019s the key section: Friedrich Hayek likened the process of controlling the economy as akin to taking a tiger by the tail. As far as inflation control is concerned, Hayek was right. As some countries are finding today, the tiger is capable of biting back. Chart 6 plots inflation expectations from financial markets in the UK, US, the euro-area and Japan over recent years. In Japan, inflation expectations have been anything but well-anchored, varying significantly around a trend close to zero. Most recently, they have been falling once again. The same is true in the euro-area and, to lesser extent, in the US. So far, inflation expectations in the UK have held up and, on a central view, the Bank expects inflation to be on target at a 2-3 year horizon. But this tiger needs careful handling. Even in the UK, some measures of household inflation expectations have fallen slightly over the course of this year. The tiger has stirred. Wearing my MPC hat, and with UK inflation already below target, this is something I am watching like a dove. Here\u2019s the full speech: Central bank psychology Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has argued that bankers\u2019 basic pay may need to be controlled if the financial sector is ever to put recent scandals behind it. In a speech in Singapore, Carney argued that much progress has been made since 2007 to make banks safer and simpler. However, finance must now The governor channelled Winston Churchill (during his time as chancellor of the exchequer) by saying: It is not merely that we should want to follow Churchill\u2019s wish to see \u201cfinance less proud and industry more content\u201d. We want to see industry content and finance taking justifiable pride in its contribution to society. That is hard, when the public are bombarded with tales of rigging in the financial market. Just last week, for example, 6 banks were fined around \u00a32.6bn for failing to prevent their traders from manipulating the foreign exchange markets. Carney warned: As Bill Dudley and my colleague Minouche Shafik have argued, the succession of scandals mean it is simply untenable now to argue that the problem is one of a few bad apples. The issue is with the barrels in which they are stored. Leaders and senior managers must be personally responsible for setting the cultural norms of their institutions. But in some parts of the financial sector the link between seniority and accountability had become blurred and, in some cases, severed. The solution may include closer control of bankers\u2019 fixed pay, making it easier to claw it back: Standards may need to be developed to put non-bonus or fixed pay at risk. That could potentially be achieved through payment in instruments other than cash. Bill Dudley\u2019s recent proposal for certain staff to be paid partly in \u2018performance bonds\u2019 is worthy of investigation as a potentially elegant solution.... The full speech is here (pdf): The future of financial reform From Tokyo, my colleague Justin McCurry reports that the Japanese government is widely expected to can the proposed sales tax hike tomorrow, and announce a snap general election: Abe now faces a difficult balancing act: whether to address Japan\u2019s huge public debt \u2013 now more than twice the size of its economy \u2013 by pushing ahead with what would be a deeply unpopular tax hike, or hold off and attempt to kickstart growth. All the indications are that Abe will opt for a delay in the tax rise and call a snap election on Tuesday. Voters will probably to go to the polls in mid-December, just halfway through his current term. \u201cIn light of the sharp fall in today\u2019s preliminary estimate, it now looks likely that PM Abe will call off the hike and announce snap elections,\u201d said Marcel Thieliant at Capital Economics. Here\u2019s Justin\u2019s full story: Japanese recession figures prompt talk of snap election Analysts at Daiwa reckon that PM Shinzo Abe\u2019s LDP party would be returned to power, despite the recession: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets agrees that Japan\u2019s unexpected slump has hit the mood in Europe: European trading this week looks set to continue the weaker theme this morning as we get set to open lower after economic data showed that Japan slipped back into recession as the economy contracted 0.4% in Q3, underlining the recent decision by the Bank of Japan to increase its stimulus program. The main European stock indices have dropped at the start of trading, as Japan\u2019s recession weighs on the markets. The German DAX and Italian FTSE MIB both shed 1%, and the French CAC is down 0.8%. And in London the FTSE 100 dropped 30 points, or 0.4%, at the open to 6626. Supermarket chains are leading the fallers: Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says investors are cautious in the face of: uneven growth, financial risks, geopolitics, waning demand and the threat of a European (and now Japanese) recession. Japan\u2019s recession shows that there simply isn\u2019t enough demand to sustain global growth and inflation, argues Daniel Alpert, managing partner of investment bank Westwood Capital. How seriously should we take David Cameron\u2019s warning that \u201cred lights are flashing\u201d for the global economy? Our economics editor Larry Elliott says that Cameron is absolutely right to be worrying about the eurozone (a clear red-flag risk). Geopolitics and slowing emerging markets are also a concern. Global trade talks? Not so much. Larry writes: The first problem he identifies is Europe, where he fears a third recession in the eurozone will lead to deflation. Given that the single currency area has never recovered from the financial and economic crisis of 2007-09, this is justified. There are already signs that the latest slowdown in Europe is having an impact on UK exports. Warning light rating: bright red. A slowdown in emerging markets is the second risk highlighted by the prime minister. This is less problematical for the UK. Some emerging market economies \u2013 such as Brazil and Russia \u2013 have weakened, but China is still expanding at 7% a year while the worst of India\u2019s problems seem to be behind it. What\u2019s more, the UK exports more to the Netherlands than it does to the Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries combined. Warning light rating: amber. Here\u2019s his full analysis: David Cameron\u2019s economic warning lights: dark days ahead? By identifying these concerns so boldly, the PM is also putting the economy at the centre of next May\u2019s general election. And also, perhaps, encouraging the voters to blame the situation overseas rather than domestic problems if things do turn sour over the next six months.... The Japanese recession a \u201cbig macro-economic shock\u2019, says Ian Williams of Peel Hunt. Williams is alarmed that domestic demand was so weak in the last quarter, with household consumption and business investment below forecast. The data increase the likelihood of PM Abe postponing the next sales tax hike and calling a snap election. Reuters reckons that the election could be announced as early as tomorrow.... UBS\u2019s former chief economist, George Magnus, is confident that prime minister Abe will now postpone the plan to raise Japan\u2019s sales tax, from 8% to 10%. Japan\u2019s plight also shows the limits of quantitative easing (QE), he adds. Shares have tumbled in Tokyo after Japan fell back into recession, and there were losses across the region. The Nikkei index of leading Japanese shares suffered its biggest one-day fall since August, shedding almost 3%. Stan Shamu of IG says: Japan\u2019s GDP release has been a key turning point for the session as optimism swiftly waned and traders took profits on equities and USD/JPY [positions on the US dollar versus the yen]. This week has been pinned as key for Abenomics and so far it certainly has not been a good start. The yen weakened sharply when the GDP data was released, hitting a seven year low of 117 yen to the $1. It then recovered a little, as traders tried to work out the implications of the recession. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The storm clouds gathering over the global economy have darkened this morning, with the unexpected news that Japan has fallen back into recession. Data released overnight shows that Japanese GDP shrank by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2014 (or 1.6% on an annualised basis), dashing hopes of a return to growth. The news sent shares sliding in Japan, and pushed the yen down to a new seven-year low against the US dollar. It\u2019s a bruising blow to prime minister Shinzo Abe, who was rumoured to have been considering a snap general election. And Abe\u2019s plan to raise Japan\u2019s sales tax next year is being blamed for causing the recession. Japanese firms cut back their inventories drastically during the quarter, in anticipation of falling demand. As Junko Nishioka, an economist at RBS Japan Securities, explains: \u201cThe impact of the sales tax was much more severe than expected.\u201d It now appears even more likely that Abe will postpone that sales tax hike now. But Japanese household consumption and capital spending only rose a little during the quarter, highlighting the weakness of its economy. As this chart from the Wall Street Journal shows, this is Japan\u2019s third recession in the last four years (and the fourth since the collapse of Lehman Brothers). The news came just a couple of hours after David Cameron warned that the global economy could be heading a new crisis. \u201cRed warning lights are flashing on the dashboard of the global economy\u201d, the prime minister warned, as the G20 meeting of world leaders ended. Writing in the Guardian (where else?), Cameron warned that the eurozone is on the brink of another recession, emerging markets are slowing down, and world trade talks have stalled. The ebola epidemic, and geopolitical crises in Ukraine and the Middle East, also threaten stability, he added. And that\u2019s even without Japan\u2019s fall back in recession.... Full story: Red lights are flashing on the global economy I\u2019ll be tracking all the key events and reaction through the day. There\u2019s not much in the calendar, but European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is testifying to the European Parliament at 2pm BST....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chair of scandal-hit outsourcing group Serco has fallen on his sword, saying that he takes \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d for the string of \u201coperational missteps\u201d that have hit the business. But Alastair Lyons, who has led the Serco board since 2010, insisted he had not been sacked. \u201cWhile colleagues have asked me not to resign, it has been my intention to step down once a new strategy and direction for the business were in place,\u201d he said. His decision to resign comes a week after Serco issued its fourth profit warning in a year, sending the stock price crashing to a 10-year low and wiping \u00a3600m off its market value. Serco, which runs trains, GP out-of-hours services, immigration detention centres and prisons, and provides street cleaning, said its 2014 profits would be \u00a320m lower than forecast because of worse-than-expected losses on some problem contracts. The government outsourcing company admitted it had made \u201cstrategic missteps\u201d, mainly by diversifying into areas of business where it had little expertise. Serco, which employs 120,000 people in 30 countries, has hardly been out of the public eye since it emerged that it had overcharged the taxpayer for tagging prisoners. The firm has also faced criticism for failure to provide decent accommodation for vulnerable asylum seekers and for running inadequate GP out-of-hours services that led to the premature end of a contract in Cornwall. Lyons is a former banking executive, who chairs motor insurer Admiral and is deputy chairman of homebuilder Bovis. In 2013, his pay from Serco rose 4% to \u00a3277,500, a year when the outsourcing company was found to have been overcharging the taxpayer for the electronic tagging of prisoners. Lyons was forced to appear before a committee of MPs, where he said the overcharging of prisoners was \u201cethically wrong\u201d and \u201cwas one of the signs that we needed to have an attitudinal change in our business\u201d. G4S, Serco\u2019s rival for government contracts, was also implicated in the tagging scandal, which led to the two companies repaying nearly \u00a3180m. He will stand down from Serco\u2019s board during the first half of the 2015, but there are no guarantees he will be gone at the time of Serco\u2019s next annual general meeting of shareholders in May. The AGM is the one guaranteed opportunity shareholders have each year to vote down the board. Rupert Soames, Serco chief executive, who arrived in May to rescue the firm, said: \u201cI want to put on record the fact that [Alastair Lyon] has done an outstanding job stewarding the company through the travails of the last 12 months.\u201d Soames has embarked on a forensic examination of Serco\u2019s books that has led to \u00a31.5bn in value being written off the company\u2019s books because of loss-making contracts. Lyons said: \u201cThe initial findings of the strategy and balance sheet review point to strategic and operational missteps at Serco for which, as chairman of the board since 2010, I take ultimate responsibility. It is also the right thing for Serco to select a new chairman, to take the helm for the future.\u201d The company said it had begun the search for a new chair immediately. The company revealed last week that it would not have made any underlying profit growth in 2009-13 were it not for a controversial contract running Australia\u2019s migrant detention centres, including a facility on Christmas Island that was condemned by Australia\u2019s top human rights official for conditions that put mothers and children at risk. Serco shares crept up three pence (1.65%) to 315 pence, after Lyons announced his departure. The stock has seen its value collapse by 123% over the last year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Allergan, the company that makes Botox, has agreed to be bought by the pharmaceutical group Actavis in a $66bn (\u00a342bn) tie-up that is one of the biggest deals of the year. The companies have agreed terms that value Allergan at $219 a share, a 10% premium on their Friday closing price of $198.65. If it goes through, the deal will allow Allergan to see off a hostile takeover from Canada\u2019s Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which has teamed up with the activist investor Bill Ackman and his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management. Allergan has spent months fending off advances from the Valeant team, because it believes the Canadian firm will slash its research budget and destroy its ability to create new products. Allergan was founded in Los Angeles in 1948 with an anti-allergy nose drop, but its bestseller is the face-freezing filler Botox, which it is seeking to develop for new purposes such as osteoporosis treatments. It acquired the rights to distribute botulinum toxin in 1988, and soon renamed it. Actavis, which makes a range of over-the-counter and prescription drugs, emerged as a white-knight bidder after an acrimonious public battle between Allergan and Valeant. The deal comfortably exceeds Valeant\u2019s latest bid, which came in at $53bn, up from an opening offer of $47bn. Allergan has rebuffed its Canadian suitor, arguing that it has a \u201cdiametrically opposed strategy\u201d, but the company has been under significant pressure and was racing to complete the deal with Actavis before a critical shareholder meeting in December that could have pushed it into Valeant\u2019s arms. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square has a 10% stake in Allergan and has been aiming to unseat the majority of the firm\u2019s board. The deal comes as the consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser confirmed that it would spin off its US-based pharmaceutical business. The company, re-named Indivior, will concentrate on drug addiction treatments and will publish a prospectus for investors on Monday before a planned flotation on the London Stock Exchange on 23 December. Indivior\u2019s chief executive, Shaun Thaxter, who has led the division within Reckitt Benckiser since 2009, said the standalone company had \u201cthe best pipeline in the world\u201d of new forms of treatment for heroin and cocaine addiction. The company, however, must persuade investors it can thrive as a standalone business as revenues shrinkfor its main product, the heroin addiction treatment Suboxone, which lost US patent protection in 2009. About 80% of Indivior\u2019s revenues come from the US, though Thaxter said the market for treatments such as Suboxone was growing as more countries treat addiction as a medical problem rather than a criminal justice issue. Indivior estimates that 1.2 million people in China are addicted to opiods and sees an opportunity for growth as Beijing seeks to offer new treatments. The Indivior spin-off will be put to a vote of Reckitt Benckiser shareholders on 11 December. The consumer goods giant, which makes Dettol, Nurofen and Finish dishwasher tablets, has said it wants to concentrate on its household brands.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The British government has been encouraged to put more effort into supporting \u201cscale-ups\u201d companies, rather than simply focusing on smaller startups. A report published by investor and entrepreneur Sherry Coutu CBE focuses on scale-ups, which it defines as companies with more than 10 staff with average annualised growth in employees or turnover of more than 20% over three years. The report claims that boosting this sector by just 1% over the next three years could create 238,000 new jobs and add \u00a338bn of value to the British economy. \u201cThe responsibility to become \u2018a scale-up nation\u2019 \u2013 to create an environment (ecosystem) where a greater number of companies reach global scale \u2013 rests with all of us who have an interest in supporting economic growth,\u201d wrote Coutu in the report. \u201cGetting our ecosystem to produce a greater number of scale-ups is more ambitious and challenging than producing a greater number of start-ups or celebrating entrepreneurs.\u201d Startups have been a major focus for the British government in recent years, including its Tech City initiative to create a startup up in east London. Coutu\u2019s report, which was commissioned by industry and government body the Information Economy Council, outlines a six-point plan to shift more focus towards scale-ups, to correct what she sees as the UK lagging behind the US and other countries in that area. The points include gathering better data to identify scale-up companies that need support and promotion; reducing skills gaps that restrict their growth through recruitment; and better training and support for managers within these companies. Coutu would also like to see more work removing barriers to scale-ups operating at home and overseas; a boost to the investment ecosystem within the UK to ensure these firms are not forced to look to the US or Asia for financing; and progress on \u201cpain points\u201d including planning laws and broadband internet headaches.

      "bodyText": "Millions of small investors are losing out because of unacceptable charges on their stocks and shares Isas, investment funds and pensions, according to a new report from a body that advises Britain\u2019s main financial watchdog. A combination of poor disclosure of vital information, weak governance and multiple conflicts of interest mean competition in the \u00a31tn retail investment market is \u201cnot working in the best interests of consumers\u201d, concluded the Financial Services Consumer Panel. The panel suggested fixing this by requiring fund management firms to quote a single, fully inclusive annual charge \u2013 though it said this remedy might \u201cshock\u201d some investors because this charge would be much higher than the currently quoted fees. The consumer panel said the problem was that many of the costs of managing investments were simply not declared to customers, and were deducted without their knowledge, even though these charges could have a huge impact on returns. Some costs, such as trading spreads, may not even be known by the fund manager. So while a small investor might be told about the annual management charge (AMC) or the \u201ctotal expense ratio\u201d, these do not include the costs of trading shares or other securities. \u201cMany of the costs and charges are deducted directly from the fund and remain hidden,\u201d said the panel, a statutory body that advises the Financial Conduct Authority. It said people were relying more and more on investments, especially in light of the recent pension reforms, and it was \u201ccompletely unacceptable that consumers do not know what firms are charging them to manage money on their behalf, and cannot compare different offers\u201d. In a strongly worded conclusion, the report said the investment world was \u201ca powerful industry in which misaligned incentives are systemic and which enjoys, largely unchallenged, the potential to exploit consumer behaviour, product structure complexity and the lack of cost transparency\u201d. Costs have a significant impact on the outcome of an investment. Last year the government said an individual who saved throughout their working life into a scheme with a 0.5% annual charge could lose about 13% of their pension pot at retirement as a result of charges. But a 1% annual charge could lop 24% off that pot. The panel said the problems it had identified were longstanding: in 2002 the government\u2019s Sandler review of the retail investment market found that \u201cthe reporting of product charges is typically neither clear nor consistent\u201d. In recent years, several leading fund managers have claimed investors are being overcharged and are losing out because of a lack of transparency. In September one of them, Neil Woodford criticised his industry for charging customers too much. One of the studies commissioned by the panel, written by a team led by David Pitt-Watson, an executive fellow at London Business School and a former director at fund manager Hermes, said there was \u201ca natural inclination for the industry to downplay the effect of charges, and even to be \u2018economical with the truth\u2019 in advising customers, since it is through charges that their income is earned\u201d. The panel said the problems needed fixing urgently, and it suggested that fund management firms could be required to quote a single and comprehensive annual charge that included estimates of \u201cforward costs\u201d such as transaction charges. All the other costs that are currently deducted directly from the fund would be borne by the firm, thereby enabling consumers to compare different firms\u2019 charges, and acting as a \u201cpowerful incentive\u201d to improve efficiency. One panel member, Teresa Fritz, said that currently when it came to charges, \u201cyou only see the top of the iceberg... Consumers have the right to know the full costs of the funds they are investing into\u201d. She said the investment industry was likely to strongly resist the idea of a single charge because the headline figure they would have to declare would probably be a lot higher than the fees they currently quote. As a result, firms\u2019 products \u201cwould, or could, look very costly all of a sudden to their investors\u201d. If consumers really knew the true cost of investment management, it might drive some to take their money out and put it into savings accounts and the like, she added.",

      "bodyText": "Homeowners keen to attract buyers in the quieter winter months are asking less for the properties than those that came onto the market in October, as high prices and new mortgage lending rules have put a temporary brake on the \u201cmini-boom\u201d in the housing market, Rightmove said on Monday. Figures from the property website showed that asking prices for homes coming onto the market in November were down 1.7% on October, while the number of homes for sale dropped to a seasonal low. Sellers typically drop asking prices in the lead up to Christmas but this year\u2019s November asking price drop, which shaves \u00a34,542 off the average property price bringing it to \u00a3267,127, is the smallest in five years. The annual rate of house price growth to November this year is still up at 8.5% after eight out of the last 12 months showed property price increases. \u201cSelling is more difficult than it was earlier in the year, though the mini-boom experienced by much of the country has hit the pause rather than the stop button,\u201d said Miles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market. \u201cUnderlying demand remains strong but has been muted by higher prices stretching affordability at the same time as the ability to borrow more to fund those higher prices has been curtailed by tighter mortgage lending criteria.\u201d However, buyers looking for a new home are not exactly spoilt for choice. The average number of properties per estate agency branch is at historically low levels with an average of 60 properties for sale. This is the lowest number ever recorded at this time of year, according to Rightmove. Lack of property choice has helped fuel this year\u2019s upwards price pressure and the website said supply shortages in some parts of the country could push prices up again in 2015. This month new listings on the property portal were down 1% on the same period last year and 15% on last month. The situation is unlikely to improve before the year end as sellers wait until after Christmas to market their home. However, some new buyers may start the traditional New Year search for property as early as Christmas Day this year, speculated Shipside, due to the lack of affordable homes on the market. In 2013, the site registered more than 500,000 visits on Christmas day, and more than 1.3m on Boxing day. The annual rate of house price growth reported by Rightmove, which looks at sale prices, is roughly in line with that of Britain\u2019s biggest building, Nationwide, which records prices once the sale has been agreed. It recently reported that the annual rate of house price growth slowed to 9% in October from 9.4% in September and said that it expected things to continue in the same direction. \u201cSome forward-looking indicators, such as new buyer inquiries, suggest that activity may soften further in the near term, especially in London,\u201d said Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist. The picture is also greatly varied across the country. Prices are up 0.8% in London compared with last month, contributing to a 16.2% rise in the capital, acording to Rightmove. This compares to a 2.6% monthly price fall in Wales, meaning prices are up just over 1% annually. The average house price in Wales is now \u00a3166,992 compared to London\u2019s \u00a3601,180.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is at the centre of a fresh pay row after it emerged it had handed \u00a31m in shares to Stephen Hester, who was in charge of the bank when traders there helped to rig foreign exchange markets. The anger over Hester\u2019s award comes alongside a report from an influential group of MPs and lords on Monday calling on regulators to step up work to overhaul the banking sector after the foreign exchange scandal \u201cexposed how much work there is still to do\u201d. Hester, who was forced out as the chief executive of RBS last year, received a chunk of shares earlier this year and is due another batch, likely to be worth around \u00a32m, early next year under long-term incentive plans. Previous payments to Hester from the bailed-out bank provoked anger, and he was repeatedly forced to waive annual bonuses while running RBS. The latest payouts to Hester, now chief executive at insurer RSA, provoked a fresh furore given that RBS was among five major banks fined last week for rigging foreign exchange markets as part of \u201cfree-for-all culture\u201d on dealing floors. The share awards were described as \u201coutrageous\u201d by Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous the he has been paid this extra \u00a31m considering \u2026 [what] was going on, including while he was in charge,\u201d said Mann. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be getting any more money.\u201d There is no suggestion that Hester or other executives were aware of misconduct by traders. Following the announcement of record fines meted out to banks by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the city regulator, RBS\u2019s current chief executive, Ross McEwan, apologised to consumers and admitted the conduct of up to 50 former and current employees was under investigation. RBS, which is more than three-quarters owned by taxpayers, declined to comment on the revelations over Hester\u2019s share awards, which were first highlighted in the Mail on Sunday. The Treasury also had little to say about the specific payout. A spokesman sought to flag up more general efforts to crack down on unacceptable pay practices in the banking sector. \u201cWe have strengthened the remuneration code \u2026 Firms must also have policies in place so they can reduce or cancel bonus payments where poor performance comes to light, and from next January further reforms mean they will be able to claw back bonuses already paid out,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cDecisions on individual remuneration are a matter for RBS,\u201d he added. The foreign exchange revelations are just the latest in a string of scandals in the banking sector and have fanned fears that support for reform is flagging. Former members of the parliamentary commission on banking standards will on Mondaycall for faster action, especially on moves to force banks to ringfence their high-street operations. They warn that plans to separate high-street and investment banks are vulnerable to being watered down by bank lobbying. A progress report from former members of the banking standards committee into how their recommendations are being implemented said: \u201cAlmost 18 months on, there are already signs that memories of the events that prompted the creation of the commission are growing hazy, and that, as banks recover their strength and self-confidence, their support for reform is also growing weaker.\u201d The commission, which included the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and was chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, was set up over the concerns about ethics in banking raised by a fine on Barclays for rigging the Libor interbank lending rate. One of its key recommendations, prompted by concerns that banks will try to dilute reforms, was for the ringfence between high-street and investment banks to be \u201celectrified\u201d \u2013 forcing a breakup of a bank which fails to comply. Tyrie says the UK cannot afford to do without an \u201ceffective and electrified ring fence\u201d. Overall, the commission\u2019s recommendations on a range of areas from pay to competition were crucial to protect taxpayers and consumers, added Tyrie. But he was critical of progress so far. \u201cThe forex scandal has exposed how much work there is still to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that, several years after the Libor scandal broke, the forex market may have been similarly exposed to rigging is extremely concerning. [The parliamentary commission] made wide-ranging proposals to deter such behaviour, but banks and regulators do not yet appear to be fully implementing them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rising consumer confidence and the prospect of late bargains mean retailers can look forward to a bounceback in shopper numbers this Christmas, industry experts are predicting. But after storms hit sales last year, the weather still has the power to make or break the festive season, said Springboard, a research firm that works with the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Springboard\u2019s figures published on Monday show the number of shoppers on UK high streets, at shopping malls and out-of-town centres fell for the seventh month running in October. Footfall was down 0.8% on a year earlier, compared with a 0.9% annual fall in September. The report also shows the first increase in vacant shops since early 2013. But Springboard predicts a Christmas recovery in shopper numbers, with December expected to bring an 8% annual jump in footfall. That compares with a tough December last year when storms and flood warnings kept shoppers at home and footfall fell an annual 2.4%. Diane Wehrle at Springboard says the last time the weather went retailers\u2019 way at Christmas was 2011 when footfall rose 5.1% but the economic backdrop was gloomier. This year the economic conditions were more favourable, with strong consumer confidence and low inflation pointing to a better Christmas. \u201cRetailers might not believe it in terms of sales value but in terms of sales volumes, it is looking good,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are more confident. House prices have gone up which makes people feel more confident as they are in a more solid financial position.\u201d But the weather could still put a dampener on things. \u201cThe Christmas trading period is a short period of time but critical so if the weather is very adverse late on it will really affect things,\u201d said Wehrle. She also predicted another game of chicken this year with many shoppers holding out for Christmas bargains and retailers waiting till the last minute to offer festive discounts. The BRC said town centres had to work harder to drive up shopper numbers after the latest monthly footfall figures showed high streets suffering while out of town retail parks continued to enjoy growth. Continuing a trend seen throughout much of this year shopping centre footfall also dropped 1.9% in October. High street footfall fell 1.4% and out-of-town rose 1.9%.
