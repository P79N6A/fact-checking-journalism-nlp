A hurtful day. The day when it was revealed that Cadbury\u2019s Creme Eggs have changed for ever. No longer shall the egg shell be made from delicious Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate. It will instead be made from disgusting, foul, vomit-inducing \u201cstandard cocoa mix chocolate\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer Dairy Milk. It is similar, but not exactly Dairy Milk,\u201d said a spokesman for Cadbury, which was bought by the US giant Kraft in 2010 and is now owned by Mondelez, with a flippancy almost as hard to stomach as this new, Frankenstein\u2019s monster of an egg is bound to be. The spokesman said the new chocolate had been tested on \u201cconsumers\u201d \u2013 industry shorthand for \u201cidiots\u201d, clearly \u2013 and had been \u201cfound to be the best one for Creme Egg\u201d. He added: \u201cThe Creme Egg had never been called Cadbury\u2019s Dairy Milk Creme Egg. We have never played on the fact that Dairy Milk was used.\u201d As true as that may be, it offers little consolation for fans of the original. The combination of Cadbury\u2019s Dairy Milk and whatever it is that goes into the cream/creme that forms the centre of a true Cadbury Creme Egg is one of the all-time great double acts. Would you separate Laurel and Hardy so lightly? Bill from Hillary? Romeo from Juliet? Bell from spigot? Of course not. It would be outrageous, not to mention unfair. All those individuals are or were utterly dependent on the other. Their relationships are or were watertight. Cadbury\u2019s Dairy Milk and whatever it is that goes into the cream/creme that forms the centre of a Creme Egg deserved the same respect. The same longevity. The Cadbury Creme Egg was a rare thing in this modern age. Its subtle blend of delicious chocolate and sweet, creamy/cremey yolk was a throwback to the days when chocolatiers took pride in their work. Without the Dairy Milk shell \u2013 and I say this without having tried the new product, obviously \u2013 we are left with nothing less than an abomination. This new Creme Egg is a Creme Egg that is barely worthy of the name. Faberg\u00e9, hen, goose \u2026 are you watching? Are you willing to have this, this \u2026 thing sully your fine work? There are already two differing Creme Eggs. There is the UK-manufactured flagship, a full 40g of chocolatey egg glory. Then there is its American, dear-god-hide-it-in-the-attic sibling, a wretched creature offering a mere 34g of satisfaction. Creme Egg enthusiasts thought the UK version was safe, although we should have seen the alarm signs. It is Kraft at whose doorstep this controversy should really be laid. It was Kraft, an awful, immoral, US behemoth, that bought Cadbury, a smiley, cottage-industry, whistle-while-you-work British chocolate-maker in a hostile takeover that created public outcry. We should have seen the alarm signs. But we were high on Dairy Milk chocolate and and whatever it is that goes into the cream/creme that forms the centre of a Cadbury Creme Egg. We had our egg and we were eating it. We were safe, we thought, as we greedily wolfed down Creme Egg after Creme Egg, laughing maniacally. Oh how wrong we were. Already, this egg announcement is threatening the stability of the UK government. What havoc will this monster wreak next? Are we really going to swallow this bad egg, America? For that is what Cadbury has wrought. A bad egg. And today will for ever be known as a bad day. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2015 to clarify the ownership of Cadbury.",

      "bodyText": "A decline on Wall Street as crude prices hit new five year lows took some of the shine off European shares, with energy companies under particular pressure thanks to the weakness in oil, writes. The FTSE 100 ended virtually unchanged after a bright start, but European markets managed to hold on to most of their early gains. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 0.28 points at 6501.42 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.38% to 9781.90 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.18% higher at 4228.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.95% to 18,349.15 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.81% at 9797.5 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 48 points or 0.27%. As for oil, Brent crude is down 5% at $47.57 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Federal Reserve member Dennis Lockhart said the strength of the US economy meant the central bank would probably be justified in raising interest rates by the middle of the year. In a rotary club speech, the Atlanta Fed president said the recovery that began in 2009 was well-advanced, and the rate rise, although likely to be small, would be \u201cmomentous\u201d when it came. He said the major risks would be outside the US, with weak global growth and the fall in oil prices complicating the outlook. He said low oil prices would ultimately benefit the US economy but at the moment they left the Fed with \u201cconsiderable ambiguity\u201d over meeting its inflation goals. Bank of France governor Christian Noyer called on Europe to consider easing Greece\u2019s debt burden again, in an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt ahead of Greek elections on 29 January. He also said the current Greek situation should not stop the European Central Bank from embarking on a quantitative easing programme. The full report is here. Oil prices continue to fall, with Brent crude now down 4.95% to $47.63 a barrel. Across the Atlantic, and Wall Street has dropped back in early trading, ahead of the start of the latest quarterly reporting season, which will give a snapshot of the state of the US corporate world and overall economy. Alcoa is due to start the ball rolling after the US market closes, with the likes of Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Intel reporting later in the week. US markets have come under pressure recently after 2014\u2019s record breaking run, with a sharp decline on Friday after the non-farm payroll figures gave a mixed picture of the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently around 70 points or 0.4% lower, helping to push the FTSE 100 into negative territory. Most European markets, however, are managing to hold on to their early gains. I mentioned earlier that Greece\u2019s general election might fail to deliver a clear winner, with the prime minister now offering the prospect of tax cuts if he can close the gap with his left-wing opposition From Athens, Helena Smith writes that Greece\u2019s future depends, in part, on citizens maintaining confidence in its banking sector: Analysts saying that to great degree a repeat of the back-to-back elections seen in 2012 will depend on the state of the banking system - and the extent to which Greeks fear for their deposits. Almost no banker, economist, or political analyst I have spoken to in recent weeks believes that there is a serious chance of Greece being ejected from the euro despite reports that lenders are \u201cstress-testing their internal systems and dusting off two-year-old contingency plans for [that] possibility,\u201d according to the WSJ today. Helena continues: But they have not ruled out an accident, nor do they exclude fears of a run on banks, if an inconclusive election result intensifies the political uncertainty. All parties, not least the radical left Syriza, know that a Cypriot-style \u2018bail-in\u2019 of depositors\u2019 accounts would be the trigger that would spark the revolt that, miraculously, has been averted so far. Greeks are not phlegmatic Greek Cypriots \u2013 and five years down the line they are in many ways much worse off. \u201cNeither a Grexit nor a bail-in is on the cards,\u201d the economy professor Theodore Pelagidis tells me. \u201cCreditors know that a bail-in would have a devastating effect on the ability of Greeks to pay their taxes. The whole system would collapse.\u201d All of which explains why Alexis Tsipras has, as of today, begun intensifying his charm offensive abroad with an op-ed in Germany\u2019s Die Welte emphasising that Athens will not be making any unilateral move, or risking its membership in the euro zone, if Syriza assumes power. The oil price is falling further, as traders in America arrive for work to hear that Goldman has slashed its forecasts (see here for details) Brent crude is now down 3.7% at $48.25 per barrel, while US crude (or NYMEX) has hit $46.62/barrel. Some quote from Citigroup\u2019s chief economist, Willem Buiter, have popped up on the wires. Buiter has predicted that Greece will get another debt structuring deal, and avoid quitting the euro. Buiter invented the term \u2018Grexit\u2019 during the height of the eurozone debt crisis, when he believes Greece was very likely to leave the single currency. This time, though, he believes Europe will muddle through: One key message from Goldman\u2019s report is that the industry must cut its costs, by at least a fifth. And uneconomic projects need to be abandoned, while cash-strapped firms may need to sell their better projects onto rivals with a stronger balance sheet. Marketwatch has a good take; here\u2019s a flavour: Cost-cutting: They estimated that costs across the industry need to be slashed by 20%-30%. For the world\u2019s largest oil companies, referred to as big Big Oil, this calls for a 30% cut to capital expenditures, just to get the free cash-flow generation back to an acceptable level. Goldman identifies cash-flow generation as one of the key concerns in the world of sluggish oil prices. Consolidation: With oil prices around $70, some unprofitable projects will have to be scrapped in a bigger mix-and-match exercise, according to the report. Essentially, there are several high-quality developments that are in lack of funding, while some poor-quality projects are owned by companies with strong balance sheets. The assets need to be redistributed, so the firms with solid balance sheets get rid of the uneconomic ventures and instead upgrade their portfolio with more promising projects, the analysts said. Global growth concerns just pushed the copper price down to a new five-year low: Britain\u2019s big four supermarkets are all cutting the price of their fuel, meaning motorists will feel some benefit from the tumbling oil price. Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco are all knocking a further 2p off their petrol and diesel. However, that doesn\u2019t take any of them below the \u00a31/litre mark, which is now available from at least one forecourt in Birmingham (as covered earlier) Press Association has the details: The Tesco cut takes effect from this afternoon, while the reductions by the other three companies will kick in tomorrow. For Asda customers, the latest reduction means they will pay no more than 103.7p a litre on petrol, with diesel at 110.7p a litre. The reductions have come after it was revealed that a Birmingham service station had cut the price of its petrol to 99.7p a litre. The RAC, which has been forecasting that petrol prices would dip below the 1-a-litre mark, welcomed the news of the Birmingham service station price cut. But the AA said that, although welcome, the Birmingham reduction \u201cappears to be a publicity stunt rather than a reflection of general pump prices\u201d. AA president Edmund King said: \u201cThere remains a postcode lottery out there when it comes to fuel prices. Drivers in rural areas are still paying much more than the 1.09 average price and in some places 1.18. \u201cIt will still take some time to get down to an average of \u00a31 per litre, particularly as 70% of the pump price is tax (57.95p duty and 18.3p VAT).\u201d A recap for new readers. The cost of oil has hit new five and three-quarter-year lows today after Goldman Sachs slashed its price forecasts, and predicted major changes in the industry. Brent crude oil fell up to 3% this morning to hit \u20ac48.45 per barrel, a level not seen since April 2009. The fall came after Goldman warned that costs in the oil industry need to fall by up 30%, to drive \u201clow-cost\u201d projects into the hands of stronger oil companies. The Wall Street bank predicts that Brent crude will only average $50/barrel this year, and could hit fall to $42 in April-June. It also predicted that Brent would average $70 in 2016-18, down from a previous forecast of $90: Goldman slashed its forecasts after realising that prices will remain low until the market has adjusted to the current unbalance between supply and demand. The search for a new equilibrium in oil markets continued.... We believe this bear market will likely be characterized by more of a U-shaped recovery in which markets take longer to recover and will likely rebound to far lower price levels from where they sold off from. This is because the current industry has far greater storage and tanker capacity and a more aggressive capital structure than it had in the more recent past which diminishes the physical market\u2019s role and increases the capital market\u2019s role. The report suggests that prices might even hit $30/barrel, although this is seen as unlikely. Goldman also published some interesting charts, showing which new oil projects are most uneconomic at current prices: They also highlighted that US suppliers have already reined in production: Oil isn\u2019t the only thing getting cheaper. Milk prices have slumped in recent weeks, forcing the country\u2019s largest dairy firm to delay payments to around 1,000 farmers. The First Milk has hit its suppliers with a two-week delay, blaming a tumble in milk prices. Wholesale milk prices have fallen by more than 50% over the past 12 months; farming unions say milk is now cheaper than bottled water.... Full story: Dairy farmers go unpaid as \u2018milk becomes cheaper than water\u2019 Ireland will be the fastest growing member of the eurozone this year, according to new forecasts from Goodbody Stockbrokers. Goodbody predicted that Irish national output will increase 4% this year, with consumer demand now firing the recovery. That\u2019s good news for the ruling Fine Gael-Labour parties, who are suffering in the opinion polls. A general election is looming, in a year from now, and Goodbody has warned against a budget giveaway in 2015: Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald explains: Goodbody urged the government in Dublin to continue with some measure of austerity.\u201dIt is important that sensible fiscal policy is not abandoned, undoing the hard-won gains of recent years,\u201d said chief economist Dermot O\u2019Leary. Meanwhile Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said today he hopes the state can recoup some of the billions it pumped into the Republic\u2019s ailing banking system during the crash. Noonan said that the government planned to claw back \u20ac18bn invested in three high street banks - Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank and Permanent TSB. Part of the recovered billions could come from the sell off of the now state owned AIB, Noonan said. Antonis Samaras\u2019s promise of future tax cuts may increase the possibility that this general election does not deliver a clear winner, if it helps narrow the gap behind Syriza. And that could mean a repeat of 2012, when Greeks went to the polls twice, as analyst Lorcan Roche Kelly points out: Greek government bonds are recovering this morning, after the country\u2019s prime minister promised to ease the country\u2019s austerity burden in an attempt to win votes. Antonis Samaras promised to cut taxes if he were returned to power after 25 January\u2019s general election. Faced with the prospect of defeat in two weeks time, Samaras told supporters that: \u201cThere won\u2019t be any further pension and wage cuts,\u201d \u201cThe next breakthrough in our growth plan includes tax cuts across the board which can happen gradually, step by step.\u201d This pledge follows a string of opinion polls putting Samaras\u2019s New Democracy (ND) party in second place, behind the left-wing Syriza party which is committed to a debt restructuring deal. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Greek debt has dropped to around 9.6% this morning, from 10.2% on Friday night. Samaras\u2019s previous warnings that a Syriza government would trigger chaos haven\u2019t woo\u2019d voters, as our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports: \u201cThe strategy of fear that the conservatives have campaigned on clearly hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d said Paschos Mandravelis, a prominent political commentator. \u201cGreeks are not buying the theory that the opposition poses a danger, so now Samaras is altering course.\u201d Full story: Greek PM Samaras forced into U-turn as Syriza closes in on election victory And Athens journalist Efthimia Efthimiou has tweeted the latest poll data: Goldman Sachs even suggests that the oil price could potentially fall towards $30 per barrel, although this isn\u2019t seen as likely (reminder, it expects Brent to average $50 this year) It says: \u201cWhile history would suggest that a storage blow-out would push spot prices below $35, we believe that by avoiding breaching storage capacity, the market will hover around $40, potentially dipping at times into the high $30s which we see as the likely lows of this cycle.\u201d. This chart shows how drastically Goldman Sachs has cut its oil forecasts: Lamprell\u2019s profit warning highlights the pressure building on Britain\u2019s energy industry. Chancellor George Osborne has already dropped a strong hint that North Sea producers will get a new tax cut in March\u2019s budget, declaring: \u201cI don\u2019t want to pre-empt the Budget but I can see that it may well involve further reducing the burden of tax on investment in the North Sea.\u201d According to the Daily Telegraph today, the industry is lobbying for a 30% tax cut.... British oil rig maker Lamprell has issued a profit warning this morning after being hit by the turmoil in the sector. Lamprell, which makes various equipment including shallow-water drilling jackup rigs and land rigs, told the City it is struggling to win new business since crude prices began tumbling. Shares dropped 15% this morning, after Lamprell predicts its revenues will be be 10% below expectations. CEO Jim Moffat warned that conditions in the oil industry have changed dramatically: \u201cWith the recent slump in the oil price, winning work in 2015 is going to be a challenge as the industry adjusts to the new realities. Shares in online electrical retailer AO World have jumped 8% after it rushed out its Christmas trading figures this morning. Online sales surged 38% in the last quarter, partly due to strong demand for Black Friday bargains. And UK technology and outsourcing group Quindell\u2019s shares has surged by 25%, after it appointed an experienced new chairman, Richard Rose. Brent crude has fallen 3% today to $48.55 per barrel as traders digest Goldman Sachs\u2019 new forecasts. That\u2019s its lowest level since May 2009, extending the sharp selloff that began last autumn. Bloomberg has a good take on the Goldman report. Here\u2019s a flavour: Goldman Sachs said U.S. oil prices need to trade near $40 a barrel in the first half of this year to curb shale investments as it gave up on OPEC cutting output to balance the market. The bank cut its forecasts for global benchmark crude prices, predicting inventories will increase over the first half of this year, according to an e-mailed report. Excess storage and tanker capacity suggests the market can run a surplus far longer than it has in the past, said Goldman analysts including Jeffrey Currie in New York. More here: Goldman Sees Need for $40 Oil as OPEC Cut Forecast Abandoned European stock markets are gaining ground in early trading, with the FTSE 100 up 35 points, or 0.5%. One of Saudi Arabia\u2019s richest businessmen has warned that oil prices will keep falling unless producers rein in supplies. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal told USA Today that: If supply stays where it is, and demand remains weak, you better believe it is gonna go down more. But if some supply is taken off the market, and there\u2019s some growth in demand, prices may go up. But I\u2019m sure we\u2019re never going to see $100 anymore. I said a year ago, the price of oil above $100 is artificial. It\u2019s not correct. He also dismissed the theory that the West is attacking Russia via the oil price as \u201cbaloney and rubbish\u201d: I\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s no way Saudis will do this. Because Saudi Arabia is hurting as much as Russia, period. Now, we don\u2019t show it because of our big reserves. But I\u2019ll tell you Saudi Arabia and Russia are in bed together here. And both are being hurt simultaneously. The interview is online here. The drop in the oil price is hurting the Russian rouble. It has fallen by 2.5% this morning to 62.8 roubles to the US dollar. The rouble is also vulnerable after Fitch downgraded Russia\u2019s credit rating to BBB- on Friday night. Motorists in Birmingham should be celebrating the recent tumble in the oil price. A garage in the Midlands city has become the first to charge less than \u00a31 for a litre of petrol since around 2009. Customers flocked to fill up at the Harvest Energy forecourt in Kings Heath after the price cut, according to the Birmingham Mail. Owner Velautham Sarveswaran told the newspaper that: \u201cMy customers have kept asking when we are going to drop the price to under \u00a31 and when I looked at the figures I realised I could do it. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not about being greedy. As long as I make enough money to cover my overheads and give me a little bit of a profit then I am happy. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling for me to be able to give cheap prices to my customers, I like making them happy.\u201d Full story: Petrol station cuts price of fuel to under \u00a31 a litre Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We can start the week with a familiar theme \u2013 oil, which has just hit a new five and a half-year low. Crude costs are dropping this morning after Goldman Sachs became the latest group to predict that prices will not bounce back soon soon. Goldman slashed its forecasts for the next two years, predicting Brent crude would average just $50 per barrel in 2015 (down from a previous forecast of $83), and $70/barrel in 2016 (down from $90). The Wall Street firm has concluded that the OPEC cartel will not cut output to halt the price slide. Instead, it believes OPEC members are determined to inflict pain on the US shale industry. Or as Goldman puts it: \u201cTo keep all capital sidelined and curtail investment in shale until the market has re-balanced, we believe prices need to stay lower for longer. \u201cThe search for a new equilibrium in oil markets continues.\u201d Goldman\u2019s forecast are, to an extend, just catching up with recent events (its clients might wish it had made these forecasts before the oil price started sliding). But they\u2019ve still had an effect on the markets. Brent crude has fallen 2% this morning, to $48.80 per barrel, a level not seen since May 2009. Also coming up today...... It looks like a fairly quiet day, with no major events or economic data releases. The markets continue to be dominated by the prospect of a new quantitative easing stimulus package from the European Central Bank. And there\u2019s less than two weeks until Greece holds her general election..... I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

For the world\u2019s largest oil companies, referred to as big Big Oil, this calls for a 30% cut to capital expenditures, just to get the free cash-flow generation back to an acceptable level. Goldman identifies cash-flow generation as one of the key concerns in the world of sluggish oil prices.</p> <p><strong>Consolidation:</strong> With oil prices around $70, some unprofitable projects will have to be scrapped in a bigger mix-and-match exercise, according to the report. Essentially, there are several high-quality developments that are in lack of funding, while some poor-quality projects are owned by companies with strong balance sheets. The assets need to be redistributed, so the firms with solid balance sheets get rid of the uneconomic ventures and instead upgrade their portfolio with more promising projects, the analysts said.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/wlwatts/statuses/554630701673619456\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>2 things the oil industry needs to do now: Goldman <a href=\"http://t.co/SrqTZ5ZUHt\">http://t.co/SrqTZ5ZUHt</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarasjolin\">@sarasjolin</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/JHHqBpjhKR\">pic.twitter.com/JHHqBpjhKR</a></p>&mdash; William Watts (@wlwatts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wlwatts/status/554630701673619456\">January 12, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54b3c3e9e4b0c53195a4bfca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-01-12T12:56:02.436Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Global growth concerns just pushed the copper price down to a new five-year low:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/humenm/statuses/554622631044190208\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>THERE, IT, GOES. 3mth LME Copper below $6,000 for the first time since the financial crisis <a href=\"http://t.co/zDIt5O0RyQ\">pic.twitter.com/zDIt5O0RyQ</a></p>&mdash; Neil Hume (@humenm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/humenm/status/554622631044190208\">January 12, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54b3bd72e4b0c53195a4bfc5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-01-12T12:37:30.842Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK supermarkets in fuel price war</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee7e6546e2f855c4b894ac52a23e46bdee5ffa9d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/12/1421065810925/72145df2-c19d-48d6-9cac-34979c74da44-460x225.jpeg\" alt=\"Drivers queue for petrol and diesel at a Sainsbury's supermarket filling station in Harrogate, North Yorkshire.\" width=\"460\" height=\"225\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Britain\u2019s big four supermarkets are all cutting the price of their fuel, meaning motorists will feel some benefit from the tumbling oil price.</strong></p> <p><strong>Asda</strong>, <strong>Morrisons</strong>, <strong>Sainsbury\u2019s</strong> and <strong>Tesco</strong> are all knocking a further 2p off their petrol and diesel.

      "bodyText": "The oil price continues to fall and petrol has dropped through the \u00a31-a-litre mark on at least one garage forecourt with others likely to follow suit soon. It all points to falling inflation, and indeed analysts expect official figures tomorrow to show inflation hit a fresh 12-year low in December. At the same time, unemployment is also coming down. For a government heading into a general election, it sounds like the perfect economic cocktail. But history would suggest the Conservatives should resist counting any votes before they are in, warns one new analysis of opinion polls and the so-called \u201cmisery index\u201d - a combination of inflation and unemployment. Martin Beck at thinktank Oxford Economics says that applying the economist\u2019s tool of the misery index would suggest that very low inflation and a further fall in the jobless rate should see the UK economy in 2015 enjoy its happiest year in more than half a century. But he also found that there is \u201clittle, if any, association between movements in the misery index and the electoral fortunes of the governing party\u201d. In this chart, Beck looks at movements in the misery index and the gap in opinion poll scores between the incumbent party and the main opposition party. As Beck points out, a halving in the misery index from 1992 to 1997 did not stop an ever larger opinion poll deficit for John Major\u2019s governing Conservative party. And while Labour won a series of election victories from 1997 to 2005, the low level of the misery index in that period was not enough to stop the party\u2019s lead in the opinion polls \u2013 and at the ballot box \u2013 eroding away. And what about the benefits of the latest drop in the misery index? Well, it has been accompanied by an improvement in opinion poll readings enjoyed by the Labour party relative to the Conservatives, Beck notes. In other words, a happy economy on this simple measure does not guarantee happy days at the ballot box. One thing the misery index does not capture is the lack of real wage growth over this parliament as pay rises have failed to match inflation. Wages have in fact been falling in real terms, leaving many households feeling worse off.

In the past two years, <a href=\"http://www.aluminum.org/driving-modern-manufacturing-renaissance\">the aluminum industry</a> has announced $2.3bn of new manufacturing investments in the US. Corporate profits at many manufacturing companies have climbed, too.</p> <p>At least some of these are on the list of the seven industries that the Boston Consulting Group identified as being most likely to participate in some kind of <a href=\"https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/manufacturing_supply_chain_management_made_in_america_again/\">big manufacturing revival</a>: transportation goods (check), computers and electronics (yup), fabricated metal products (yes), machinery, plastics and rubber, appliances and furniture.</p> <p>The whole manufacturing renaissance saga even hit the bestseller lists in recent months, with Factory Man<em> </em>(which, as the subtitle promises, tells the story of How One Furniture Maker Battled Offshoring, Stayed Local \u2013 and Help Save an American Town) winning a coveted spot on the New York Times\u2019 list of the year\u2019s most notable books <em>and </em>reviewer Janet Maslin\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/books/beth-macys-factory-man-michael-lewiss-flash-boys-and-more.html?_r=0\">personal top 10 list.</a> </p> <p>The problem?

And it\u2019s one that you may want to ponder if you were planning on putting a large chunk of your investment savings to work in this as an investment theme, or betting that there will be a great, stable new source of jobs emerging sometime soon. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that we\u2019ve had four straight years of growth, and that we\u2019ve added 520,000 jobs in manufacturing in the last three years,\u201d says Nager. But that compares to 2.5m jobs lost between 2007 and 2009. Moreover, he adds, the dramatic turnaround of the auto industry has distorted those figures. </p> <p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/business/us-auto-sales-jump-for-2014.html\">16.5m vehicles were sold nationwide</a>, making it the industry\u2019s best year since the Great Recession, when sales plunged to hit a low of 10.4m vehicles in 2010. \u201cThere is almost an elevated level of demand,\u201d says Nager, who notes that of all the manufacturing jobs created since 2010, 72% of them have been in the automotive sector.</p> <p>But as investors in the shale oil and gas industry are discovering, there\u2019s a danger in pinning all one\u2019s hopes for and conviction in a broad-based manufacturing renaissance on what happens in a single industry.</p> <p>Then there are the myths to which the true believers in the manufacturing renaissance subscribe: for instance, that China\u2019s rising labor costs suddenly will make it more economic to stay put in the US, or even to repatriate manufacturing operations \u2013 a phenomenon, still scarce, known as \u201creshoring\u201d. </p> <p>The problem? Wages are rising in coastal areas like Shenzhen, but in order for a company to stay put, they\u2019d have to feel confident that they would continue to climb (unclear) and that there were no other alternatives. The latter, at least, is clearly not the case. Some companies have already shifted facilities further inland in China, or even left China for Vietnam, Cambodia or (in the case of textiles) Bangladesh.</p> <p>The good news, says Nager, is that there <em>is </em>enough onshoring happening today to offset the effect of offshoring: companies are repatriating about 30,000. \u201cBut there are still millions that have left, and they won\u2019t come back unless it makes economic sense to do so,\u201d he adds. Again, this seems to be a trend that is <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/president-obama-touts-onshoring-made-america-back-221759270.html\">lauded by politicians</a>, but driven by anecdotes rather than supported by hard data.</p> <p>And if you\u2019re waiting for global shipping costs or the shale gas revolution to ignite the manufacturing revival, you may wait a long time.

It\u2019s not very likely that manufacturing will once again be a major force in the US economy, accounting for a large and growing chunk of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and offering stable, well-paid jobs to a substantial part of the country\u2019s population. In other words, the alleged \u201cmanufacturing renaissance\u201d isn\u2019t going to pull our economic chestnuts from the fire.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that manufacturing can\u2019t become a new and interesting force in the economy.

We also, suggests Nager, need to be sure that we\u2019re read, by investing in technology-focused education and by developing more assertive trade policies, to ensure that whatever new manufacturing ventures we develop we can keep, without them being undermined by non-tariff barriers that contributed to the loss of jobs in sectors like steel and textiles. \u201cThis isn\u2019t protectionism, but ensuring we have a level playing field.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The period over Christmas and New Years is generally a slow one for economics and politics. But over this holiday period there were a few signals on the key economic battlegrounds for the next 12 months. And oddly, these signals seem to reinforce the perception that the government\u2019s policies are unfair. </p> <h2><strong>1. Welfare</strong></h2> <p>The big political and economic move over the summer was the cabinet reshuffle that moved Scott Morrison to social services. The appointment and commentary supplied by Tony Abbott suggests that the government view welfare cuts as a big-ticket item this year. </p> <p>Of course it will be sold as \u201creform\u201d \u2013 all cuts are packaged as reforms. Some lazy media outlets will parrot that term and others, like the <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/federal-cabinet-reshuffle-scott-morrison-picks-up-social-services-portfolio-in-bid-to-stop-the-bludgers/story-fni0cx12-1227163795658\">Daily Telegraph</a>, will even more lazily suggest the cuts are all about \u201cstopping the bludgers\u201d.</p> <p>Thus the government\u2019s response to attacks that the budget was unfair and hit the poorest hardest seems to be to target some of the poorest in society. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0007897/quotes\">Pepper Brooks</a> might say: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0007897/quotes\">It\u2019s a bold strategy</a>, Let\u2019s see if it pays off for \u2018em.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, it is worth remembering that growing welfare numbers are driven by age rather than bludgers. Moreover, the overall percentage of the population on welfare is less than it was a decade ago and recent increases were primarily due to the GFC, as the numbers of those on Newstart naturally increased with unemployment.</p> <p>The most recent statistical release from the <a href=\"https://www.dss.gov.au/about-the-department/publications-articles/research-publications/statistical-paper-series\">Department of Social Security</a> showed that nearly 2.3m people in 2012 were on the age pension \u2013 up from 1.8m in 2002. But while this seems a large increase, the population has of course also increased in that time. And importantly, so too has the number of workers. This is important because the real concern about welfare is that there is an increase in the number of people receiving welfare compared to the number of people working (and thus paying income tax which helps pay for welfare).</p> <p>As a ratio of people in the labour force, the increase in aged pensioners over the 10-year period only grew from 18.6 to 19.1: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/pITnE/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"620\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Similarly, while there was a strong increase in the 1990s of people receiving the disability support pension (DSP), since 2002 the ratio of people on DSP to those in the labour force has remained relatively stable. </p> <p>Also, the Gillard government\u2019s changes to the eligibility of DSP in the<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/gillard-tightens-disability-pension/story-fn59niix-1226104617671\"> 2011-12 budget</a> appeared to have slowed the growth of DSP \u2013 especially for those under the age of 60:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/p0uGS/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"620\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The data for 2013 will be released later this month and it will be interesting to see if, as is expected, the growth of DSP recipients continues to slow, while the percentage of the population on the age pension continues to rise. </p> <p><strong>2. Workplace Relations </strong></p> <p>The start of every year inevitably brings with it debate over workplace relations. Mostly this is because the first half of the year sees submissions to the Fair Work Commission on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/grogonomics/2014/jan/13/minimum-wage-fear-and-loathing-not-based-on-evidence\">minimum wage</a>. In late December, the issue was also given a boost by the government who asked <a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/current/workplace-relations\">the Productivity Commission</a> to review the workplace relations framework. </p> <p>Rather than focus on the actual minimum wage, the topic of choice by employer groups this year has been against <a href=\"http://www.fairwork.gov.au/Pay/penalty-rates-and-allowances\">penalty rates</a>, whereby workers get paid higher wages for working on weekends and public holidays. This focus isn\u2019t that unusual \u2013 it pretty much is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/03/penalty-rates-campaign-aims-to-cut-sunday-rates-to-saturday-level\">an ongoing campaign</a>. The government is notionally leaving the fight to the employer groups, but it is pretty clear the minister for employment, Senator Eric Abetz, is in agreement with them. </p> <p>But while there is a good deal of logic to the argument that penalty rates for Saturday and Sunday should be equal, as always occurs with this debate, an employer has produced a dopey line about how working on the weekends is now standard fare. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/employers-step-up-efforts-to-get-rid-of-penalty-rates-20150102-12gylv.html\">Sydney Morning Herald</a> quoted Lindsay Partridge, the managing director of Australia\u2019s biggest brick making company, Brickworks, saying that \u201cfor many employees, working weekends and nights was no longer considered unsociable, and taking midweek breaks was preferable for some working families\u201d. Which is just bullshit.</p> <p>The canard that Monday to Friday work is becoming less normal is one employers have long been trying to have us believe, but is rather resistant to facts. </p> <p>In 1997, 69.7% of us had jobs from Monday to Friday; in 2012 so \u201cabnormal\u201d had working during the week become that this had fallen all the way to ... 68.9%. </p> <p>Now maybe a less than one percentage point change in 12 years suggests a major cultural shift, but for me, I\u2019m more inclined to suggest it means an overwhelming majority of people still think working Monday to Friday is the norm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Txpbz/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Sure 30.1% of us work both weekdays and weekends, but that is actually down from 30.3% in 2000. That figure includes those who work multiple jobs. Only 28.5% of those who have just one job work both weekdays and weekends, and only 1% of people only work on the weekends.</p> <p>Partridge can have his days off in the middle of the week if he wants, but pretty much every other \u201cworking family\u201d would like weekends for the parents to spend time with their kids, to go to the footy, or attend any other of the myriad of social activities which oddly seem to be scheduled for Saturday and Sunday. </p> <p><strong>3. GST</strong></p> <p>The calls for a change to the GST have also been around for a long time. Given that the government is soon to release its tax reform white paper, which will include discussion of the GST, it\u2019s no surprise that the issue has cropped up over summer. </p> <p>Government backbencher Dan Tehan has <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-05/gst-liberal-mp-dan-tehan-calls-for-broadening-budget/6000802\">led the way</a>, calling for GST to be broadened to be applied to food and education \u2013 a move supported by the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/andrew-robb-first-abbott-government-minister-to-publicly-back-gst-expansion-20150108-12kq1w.html\">minister for trade, Andrew Robb</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2014-15/content/myefo/html/06_attachment_c.htm\">mid-year fiscal and economic outlook</a> suggests that the GST exemption on food, education and health lost $14.15bn revenue in 2014-15. </p> <p>As I have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/feb/06/paying-gst-education-unpopular-but-progressive?CMP=soc_567\">argued in the past</a>, while a GST on food would be a regressive tax hitting the poorest hardest, taxing education would be progressive \u2013 wealthier families spend more of their income on private school fees than poorer families.</p> <p>This position was echoed last week by <a href=\"http://www.tai.org.au/content/how-extend-gst-without-hurting-poor\">The Australia Institute</a>,which released a report arguing that GST on private education and private health insurance would \u201cbroaden the tax base, and do so in a way that does not overburden Australia\u2019s poorest families\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/KlOTW/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"620\" height=\"420\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Broadening the tax to include these items would also be one way of overcoming the difficulty of increasing the GST espoused by Joe Hockey in <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/aust-cant-afford-gst-increase-hockey/story-fn3dxiwe-1227160165538\">late December</a>. He noted, quite correctly, that after increasing the GST, income tax should be lowered to overcome the regressive impact. He noted that with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/dec/16/the-coalitions-rhetoric-on-the-budget-have-come-back-to-haunt-them\">declining revenue concerns</a>, \u201cWe haven\u2019t got the financial capacity to do that at the moment\u201d. </p> <p>Raising the GST, either by increasing the rate above 10% or by broadening its base without lowering income tax to cancel out the tax increase, would be an extremely politically courageous move \u2013 and not one that the current government with its low poll numbers is likely to be silly enough to make.</p> <p>The summer months allows the government to tentatively float some thought bubbles at a time when they largely avoid the bright light of scrutiny as everyone is focused more on sport and holidays. But given these three areas have the potential to reinforce voters\u2019 image of the government as unfair, expect the opposition parties to remind voters of them throughout 2015. </p>",

The mid-year fiscal and economic outlook suggests that the GST exemption on food, education and health lost $14.15bn revenue in 2014-15. As I have argued in the past, while a GST on food would be a regressive tax hitting the poorest hardest, taxing education would be progressive \u2013 wealthier families spend more of their income on private school fees than poorer families. This position was echoed last week by The Australia Institute,which released a report arguing that GST on private education and private health insurance would \u201cbroaden the tax base, and do so in a way that does not overburden Australia\u2019s poorest families\u201d. Broadening the tax to include these items would also be one way of overcoming the difficulty of increasing the GST espoused by Joe Hockey in late December. He noted, quite correctly, that after increasing the GST, income tax should be lowered to overcome the regressive impact. He noted that with declining revenue concerns, \u201cWe haven\u2019t got the financial capacity to do that at the moment\u201d. Raising the GST, either by increasing the rate above 10% or by broadening its base without lowering income tax to cancel out the tax increase, would be an extremely politically courageous move \u2013 and not one that the current government with its low poll numbers is likely to be silly enough to make.

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney finds out this week if he will be the first governor since Bank of England independence in 1997 to write an open letter to the chancellor explaining why inflation is so low. An oil market slump, a supermarket price war and a freeze on household utility bills is widely expected to have brought December inflation down below 1% for the first time since June 2002. Under the Bank\u2019s remit, if inflation strays more than one percentage point in either direction from the 2.0% target the governor must write to the chancellor explaining why inflation is off target and what the central bank intends to do about it. All of the 14 letters written until now have been after inflation missed the target too far in the other direction, overshooting by more than 1 percentage point. Inflation on the consumer price index (CPI) measure fell to a 12-year low of 1% in November. Official figures on Tuesday are expected to show it dropped further in December. Economists are forecasting inflation of just 0.7%, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll. The drop will not come as any surprise to the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) which said in its November inflation report that inflation was likely to fall below 1% in early 2015. \u201cThe lower oil price is amongst the factors that are set to push CPI inflation as low as 0.7% year-on-year this month,\u201d said Sam Hill, senior UK economist, RBC Capital Markets. \u201cIt is almost certain to be the first time in the MPC\u2019s history that inflation has missed the target on the downside by more than a percentage point, requiring a letter of explanation from the governor.\u201d The UK is widely expected to avoid the fate of the eurozone, where all-out deflation was confirmed last week, but inflation is seen remaining low for some time meaning the Bank of England will be in no hurry to raise interest rates from their record low of 0.5%. The thinktank Capital Economics predicts December inflation will come in as low as 0.5%. \u201cAdmittedly, there is a risk that the number is slightly stronger, if weak core inflation in November was a symptom of temporary discounting. That said, we still think inflation will drift lower over the coming months, as the effect of the fall in oil prices fully passes through,\u201d it said in a preview note. Overall, the fall in inflation, which has halved over the last year, has been portrayed as good news for the economy, bringing relief to households squeezed by slow wage growth and rising bills. Motorists have been cheered by falling fuel prices and the prospect of \u00a31 a litre at the pump thanks to crude oil more than halving since last summer. Last month, Carney said lower oil prices were largely positive for consumers and should support economic growth in the UK. Low inflation and falling costs are cited on Monday in a survey suggesting UK businesses were at their most optimistic for three months in December and continued to hire new workers at a steady rate. UK businesses expect to grow in the first half of 2015, buoyed by low inflation, according to the latest business trends report by accountants and business advisers BDO. But a separate poll chimes with other recent indicators suggesting the economy lost momentum at the end of last year. As the global economic outlook clouded, business growth slowed and hiring moderated in December across England and Wales, according to the latest Lloyds Bank regional purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). However, companies reported that cost pressures had eased, largely reflecting lower fuel bills and falling commodity prices. The index measuring overall business activity across England fell from 57.7 in November to 55.9 in December, pointing to the slowest pace of output growth for a 18 months. Tim Hinton at Lloyds Banking Group commented: \u201cFirms across England and Wales remain in expansion mode, but there are signs that the recovery slipped down a gear at the end of 2014. Global economic uncertainty is affecting firms\u2019 confidence to invest and ability to grow, but falling oil prices may start to ease cost pressures for companies and help support consumer spending in the months ahead.\u201d",
