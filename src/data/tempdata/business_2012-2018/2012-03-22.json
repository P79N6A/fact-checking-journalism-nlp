      "bodyText": "For the last two months some sceptics have asked where consumer spending is coming from. Two months of positive retail sales came out of nowhere to give the impression that Britain was getting back on its feet, and the consumer was leading the charge. There was evidence during January and February that middle income consumers were refusing to pay down debt and the poorest were turning to pay day loan companies in ever bigger numbers. Maybe they were spending the money on the high street. It seemed implausible, but the Office for National Statistics figures said the tills were ringing. Retail spending figures and the ONS's revised data for January show this was always wrong. The spending splurge was a mirage and while green shoots of recovery from the consumer side of the economic equation appeared real, they were a trick of the light. When they were published, the ONS figures for January didn't add up without a huge rise in borrowing. Now we know the rise in inflation, which is still high despite coming down to 3.4%, combined with ultra low wage rises (the annual rise is running at 1.7%), continues to depress consumption. Borrowing, such as it is, can be seen in a slow decline rather than the rapid decline many economists believe is necessary to bring household debts back to manageable levels. Ben Broadbent, the Goldman Sachs economist and monetary policy committee member, took the opposite line in a speech last week. He said households can sustain higher levels of debt than previously believed because most of the equity released from the housing market had gone into savings and the net position was little changed from the early 1990s. With households no more leveraged than two decades ago, they are freer to spend than many think. This argument mentions, but ultimately ignores that most of the benefits of housing have been hoarded by older households and bigger mortgages taken on buy young families. Young families are the life blood of the economy and they remain up to their necks in debt. An aggregate view of macro-economic trends gives a distorted impression of the consumer. The budget did nothing to help young families. With tax credit and housing benefit cuts to come this year and next, spending is likely to remain subdued.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barack Obama is scrambling to find a heavyweight US candidate to stand for the job of president of the World Bank, with the deadline for nominations looming. Two credible developing country candidates \u2013 Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Nigerian finance minister, and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo, the Colombian former finance minister and development economist \u2013 have already joined the race, together with the American economist Jeffrey Sachs, who has the backing of several developing countries. The calibre of the field means the US won't be able to stitch up the job, as is traditional, by handing it to a faceless White House bureaucrat or a favoured presidential lieutenant. Instead, Obama has been casting around for a figure with the requisite gravitas to lead the international field. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, has long been touted, but has denied that she wants the job, and is thought to want another shot at the presidency. Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and once an adviser to Bill Clinton, has the backing of his successor, Tim Geithner \u2013 but he is highly controversial with many in Europe and the developing world, because he is seen as an outspoken advocate of the deregulation that led to the financial crisis. Susan Rice, America's ambassador to the UN, has clashed with China and Russia over the crisis in Syria. Rumours of other wildcard candidates, including PepsiCo boss Indra Nooyi \u2013 whose Indian origins might give her an edge with the Bric countries \u2013 and even Bill Gates, have been swirling in Washington. Ever since the Bretton Woods institutions were founded, in the aftermath of the second world war, the Bank has been run by an American, and the International Monetary Fund by a European, under a gentleman's agreement. But as the emerging economies, including China, India and Russia, have won greater influence at the Washington-based lender there has been a growing chorus calling for a candidate from outside the west. When Dominique Strauss-Kahn stepped down ignominiously from the top job at the IMF last year the formidable Christine Lagarde had been swiftly nominated and backed by a series of European countries, including the UK, before any credible rival could get out of the blocks. But with World Bank boss Robert Zoellick departing in a more conventional fashion this summer, after serving a notice period, there was no excuse for anything but the open nomination process the Bank has long promised. A Department for International Development spokesperson said: \"Britain supports an open and transparent selection process. All candidates for the job must be considered on their merits.\" The Bank is not expected to make a formal announcement about who has been nominated, but will publish a three-strong shortlist next week, and the candidates will then be interviewed by its board. Most seasoned World Bank-watchers expect the ultimate outcome to be that an American gets the job: the US still has a dominant voice at the Washington-based institution, and Obama won't want to look weak by ceding a major source of international influence in an election year. But in the wake of the global financial crisis, emerging world powers such as Brazil and China have become increasingly critical of the assumption of the US and Europe that they know best. If Obama fields a weak or a controversial candidate against the seasoned operator and World Bank veteran Okonjo-Iweala, there is sure to be a noisy backlash. As Liz Stuart, senior policy adviser for Oxfam, says: \"I think we can assume there are lots of talented people who work in development who aren't American.\" Who's in the running? Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala: Nigerian finance minister for the second time, and the developing country candidate to beat. As a former World Bank managing director, she knows the institution inside out. She has also been on the front line of tackling poverty and corruption at home, and fought for debt relief from the West. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo: a former Colombian finance minister who studied and is based at Columbia University, in the US. He is a heavyweight academic economist who has had first-hand experience in government in a developing country, and held a senior UN post. He has won Brazil's backing. Hillary Clinton: still widely rumoured to be the most likely US candidate. But she has repeatedly said she doesn't want the job and her hardline attitude to human rights abuses in her current job as secretary of state is said to have made the Chinese sceptical about her candidacy. Jeffrey Sachs: US economist and author, now at Columbia University, says he has the support of several developing countries, many of which he has advised over the years. He too is controversial because of questions over his role in Russia's \"shock therapy\" economic reforms in the 1980s. He's also seen as too liberal to win the backing of the White House. Susan Rice: US ambassador to the United Nations. She is used to charming her way through international diplomatic circles \u2013 a key part of the job of a World Bank boss \u2013 but she may not be well-known enough to trump Iweala and allow America to hold onto its supremacy at the Bank.",

    "webTitle": "Next's Lord Wolfson warns of 'uncertain outlook' even as profits rise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lord Wolfson, boss of the Next retail chain, has warned of a \"very uncertain\" outlook for the high street in 2012, with any boost from lower inflation outweighed by the reluctance of banks to lend and rising unemployment. His comments came despite the company reporting a healthy 5% rise in underlying profit to \u00a3570m last year, thanks to its directories and online business, where sales rose 16% to more than \u00a31bn. Wolfson said the decision of several mortgage companies to increase their rates even though the base rate was unchanged laid bare the ongoing credit squeeze that would inevitably constrain discretionary spending. \"Accordingly, we are budgeting conservatively,\" he said. Wolfson added: \"Credit availability remains very tight for business and consumers alike \u2026 credit conditions are unlikely to ease.\" Wolfson cited the regulatory clampdown on banks, forcing them to hold more capital, as the main reason for the squeeze. He said: \"Employment took a turn for the worse in the middle of last year and currently the creation of jobs in the private sector is only barely keeping pace with reductions in public sector employment. So it looks as though there is little chance of increased employment improving the consumer economy.\" But it's not all doom and gloom, Wolfson said, because inflation has begun to fall and should ease further, meaning that by the third quarter of 2012, consumers should see their incomes rising broadly in line with prices \u2013 \"marking a welcome end to deflation in real earnings\". Looking back to 2011, he said Next had done remarkably well at a time when consumer demand had been held back by a combination of high inflation, low wage growth and limited availability of credit. Next's costs rose as soaring cotton prices and overseas wage inflation were passed on by manufacturers, forcing the retailer in turn to push up prices to customers by 7%. But falling like-for-like sales in the shops were offset by brisk business at the directories and online operation, as well as by the introduction of additional floor space. Retail space in stores was increased by nearly 7% and the size of the estate grew from 525 shops in January 2011 to 536 at the same time this year. Profit at the retail chain was down 1.6%, but up 18.4% to \u00a3263m for directories. The dividend was raised 15% and the company said it remained committed to returning money to shareholders through share buybacks. During the year, it spent \u00a3290m on buybacks, with a further \u00a3135m paid out in dividends. Next said it would continue to invest in its standalone Home stores. It currently has 43 of these home furnishings shops, all of which are said to be \"extremely profitable\". Kingfisher, Europe's top DIY retailer, also provided relief for shareholders, reporting better-than-expected results last year. The B&amp;Q owner announced pre-tax profits of \u00a3807m for the 12 months to January, up 20%, with the annual dividend improved by 25%. Like Wolfson, Kingfisher's chief executive Ian Cheshire was cautious about near-term prospects, saying: \"The immediate economic outlook remains uncertain, but we face the future in robust shape.\" Kingfisher, which also runs the Castorama and Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t stores in France and elsewhere, said group revenue rose by 4% to \u00a310.8bn with like-for-like sales (excluding new openings) up by 1.3%.",

      "body": "<p><strong>BAE Systems</strong> slipped more than 1.5% on talk it was looking at a possible multi-billion dollar acquisition in the US.</p> <p>Traders suggested the company was one of three bidders considering an offer for <a href=\"http://www.esterline.com/\" title=\"\">Esterline Technologies</a>, a specialist in sensors and systems used in aircraft such as the Joint Strike Fighter and Boeing Dreamliner. The others are believed to be United Technologies and Honeywell.</p> <p>Esterline, which reported better than expected quarterly results earlier this month, owns a number of UK businesses including Weston Aerospace and Racal Acoustics. Its shares currently trade at around $65 a share but there was speculation any offer would have to be pitched closer to $100, which would value the business at around $3bn. BAE closed down 4.8p at 304.2p.</p> <p>Overall the market fell sharply after a disappointing set of manufacturing data from China and the eurozone, with the latter possibly in recession. Better than expected US weekly jobless claims did little to lift the downbeat mood, and the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>finished 46.30 points lower at 5845.65. The leading index is on course for its worst week so far this year.</p> <p>Mining shares fell back on the worries about a slowdown in global demand, particularly from key market China. <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> dropped 65p to \u00a312.87, <strong>Xstrata</strong> lost 35p to \u00a311.07, and <strong>Antofagasta</strong> fell 51p to \u00a311.41.</p> <p>In addition <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> lost 830p to \u00a357.65 following a reported coup in Mali, where the miner has around 70% of its gold production.</p> <p>Defensive shares were in demand, with <strong>United Utilities</strong> up 8p to 618p, helped by an upbeat trading statement in which it said revenues for the year should increase by between 3% and 4%.</p> <p><strong>Severn Trent </strong>also benefited, rising 12p to \u00a315.89.</p> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> continued its recent good run, boosted by positive notes from Morgan Stanley - which speculated on an eventual tie-up with US partner Verizon - and Goldman Sachs. The mobile phone company closed 2.45p higher at 173.75p.</p> <p>There was a mixed response to the two main retail results of the day. B&amp;Q owner <strong>Kingfisher</strong> shook off early falls to end 7.4p higher at 307.4p, but <strong>Next</strong> dipped 1p to \u00a329.14 after giving a cautious outlook for the year given the current consumer squeeze.</p> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> slipped 8.5p to \u00a328.43 after the UK High Court found a patent on its extended-release version of antipsychotic treatment Seroquel to be invalid. The ruling followed a challenge by a number of rivals including Teva and Novartis, and comes as the drug faces growing generic competition in the US and Europe this month.</p> <p>Analysts at Liberum Capital suggested the company needed to make an acquisition to boost its pipeline and increase earnings. They said US group Forest Laboratories was a possible $10bn target for Astra.</p> <p><strong>Amec</strong>, the engineering group which serves the mining, oil and energy industries, dropped 34p to \u00a311.09 after JP Morgan Cazenove moved from overweight to neutral, saying:</p> <blockquote> We are seeing increasingly definitive signs that a lack of available supply for oilfield equipment and services will lead to a tightening in the market and a return to the inflationary cycle that was so evident in 2005-07. Several oilfield services companies are already booked out for most of this year, and oil companies are signalling early concerns that a lack of the assets, that are so critical to fulfilling their exploration and field development ambitions, could start to cause delays. We downgrade Amec, as we see relatively little pricing benefit through the cycle. <br> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Regus</strong>, the office space specialist, rose 7.4p to 114.5p after an upgrade from Credit Suisse following the company's results. The bank raised its target price from 100p to 130p:</p> <blockquote> We raise our 2012 and 2013 earnings per share estimates by 7% and 15% respectively. Regus expects to open 200 or more centres in 2012. New centres come at a cost (both capex and opex) that dilutes short term profitability and cash generation.

      "bodyText": "BAE Systems slipped more than 1.5% on talk it was looking at a possible multi-billion dollar acquisition in the US. Traders suggested the company was one of three bidders considering an offer for Esterline Technologies, a specialist in sensors and systems used in aircraft such as the Joint Strike Fighter and Boeing Dreamliner. The others are believed to be United Technologies and Honeywell. Esterline, which reported better than expected quarterly results earlier this month, owns a number of UK businesses including Weston Aerospace and Racal Acoustics. Its shares currently trade at around $65 a share but there was speculation any offer would have to be pitched closer to $100, which would value the business at around $3bn. BAE closed down 4.8p at 304.2p. Overall the market fell sharply after a disappointing set of manufacturing data from China and the eurozone, with the latter possibly in recession. Better than expected US weekly jobless claims did little to lift the downbeat mood, and the FTSE 100 finished 46.30 points lower at 5845.65. The leading index is on course for its worst week so far this year. Mining shares fell back on the worries about a slowdown in global demand, particularly from key market China. Vedanta Resources dropped 65p to \u00a312.87, Xstrata lost 35p to \u00a311.07, and Antofagasta fell 51p to \u00a311.41. In addition Randgold Resources lost 830p to \u00a357.65 following a reported coup in Mali, where the miner has around 70% of its gold production. Defensive shares were in demand, with United Utilities up 8p to 618p, helped by an upbeat trading statement in which it said revenues for the year should increase by between 3% and 4%. Severn Trent also benefited, rising 12p to \u00a315.89. Vodafone continued its recent good run, boosted by positive notes from Morgan Stanley - which speculated on an eventual tie-up with US partner Verizon - and Goldman Sachs. The mobile phone company closed 2.45p higher at 173.75p. There was a mixed response to the two main retail results of the day. B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher shook off early falls to end 7.4p higher at 307.4p, but Next dipped 1p to \u00a329.14 after giving a cautious outlook for the year given the current consumer squeeze. AstraZeneca slipped 8.5p to \u00a328.43 after the UK High Court found a patent on its extended-release version of antipsychotic treatment Seroquel to be invalid. The ruling followed a challenge by a number of rivals including Teva and Novartis, and comes as the drug faces growing generic competition in the US and Europe this month. Analysts at Liberum Capital suggested the company needed to make an acquisition to boost its pipeline and increase earnings. They said US group Forest Laboratories was a possible $10bn target for Astra. Amec, the engineering group which serves the mining, oil and energy industries, dropped 34p to \u00a311.09 after JP Morgan Cazenove moved from overweight to neutral, saying: We are seeing increasingly definitive signs that a lack of available supply for oilfield equipment and services will lead to a tightening in the market and a return to the inflationary cycle that was so evident in 2005-07. Several oilfield services companies are already booked out for most of this year, and oil companies are signalling early concerns that a lack of the assets, that are so critical to fulfilling their exploration and field development ambitions, could start to cause delays. We downgrade Amec, as we see relatively little pricing benefit through the cycle. Among the mid-caps Regus, the office space specialist, rose 7.4p to 114.5p after an upgrade from Credit Suisse following the company's results. The bank raised its target price from 100p to 130p: We raise our 2012 and 2013 earnings per share estimates by 7% and 15% respectively. Regus expects to open 200 or more centres in 2012. New centres come at a cost (both capex and opex) that dilutes short term profitability and cash generation. But new centres mature, become profitable, create value and add to the long term future earnings and cash generative potential of the group. We think that on a standalone basis the mature centres are worth 127p per share implying a negative 23p a share valuation for the new centres that we estimate can create a 27% internal rate of return over 10 years.",

Following problems at its Hatfield distribution centre, Ocado intends to add \"customer service based targets\" to the existing sales growth, profitability and strategic goals for three directors: Tim Steiner, Jason Gissing and Neill Abrams. The annual report shows that the trio \u2013 along with imminently departing finance director Andrew Bracey \u2013 did not receive bonuses for the year to 27 November 2011 because they failed to meet the targets required for the payments \u2013 worth up to 100% of salary \u2013 to be made. Pay rises were also ruled out. As a result, Steiner took home \u00a3354,000, Gissing \u00a3253,000, Abrams \u00a3203,000 and Bracey, who will leave tomorrow, \u00a3253,000. All were lower than the previous year, when chief executive Steiner received \u00a3574,000. Bracey is losing some 3.3m shares, worth almost \u00a34m at the current share price of 118p, as a result of his surprise departure to join global headhunter Michael Page. His departure sparked concerns that he had lost faith in the company that he helped to float on the stock market. The shares remain well below the 180p level at which the company floated in July 2010 and the remuneration committee said the directors' salaries would be frozen at 2009 levels because of the \"lower than forecast trading performance of the business and the operational problems faced by the business\" during that period. The bonuses were not paid out because the group did not achieve \"positive earnings before tax\", which overrode all the other targets attached to the potential payments. The group, which is the brainchild of former Goldman Sachs bankers Steiner and Gissing, made a loss of \u00a32.4m during the 12-month period, an improvement on the \u00a39.8m loss made a year earlier. Bracey's surprise departure led to a number of boardroom changes, with Gissing, who had been adopting a hands-off approach, taking on the role of commercial director. Abrams became human resources chief in addition to legal and business affairs director. Mark Richardson, head of technology since 2001, joined the board in January 2012 but details of his pay are not included as it falls outside the period. Steiner remains chief executive. All directors have substantial holdings of shares: Steiner 14.3m, Gissing 9.6m, Bracey 812,000 and Abrams 360,600. Bracey has pledged not to sell his holding despite his move to Michael Page.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Retail sales volumes fell by more than expected in February, while January's increase was revised down sharply. Here's what economists made of the data", 
      "body": "<h2>Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight </h2> <p>There is a double whammy of bad news in the retail sales data with sales volumes falling by a much greater than expected 0.8% in February and January's increase being revised sharply down from 0.9% to 0.3%.</p> <p>It has to be said that the 0.3% rise in sales volumes in January is more in line with the survey evidence from the CBI and British Retail Consortium.</p> <p>The data puts a real dent in hopes that the consumer may be perking up appreciably and tempers hopes that GDP will see a relatively decent return to growth in the first quarter after the 0.2% contraction in GDP suffered in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p> <p>On the positive side, consumer price inflation has fallen back appreciably since peaking last September (from a three-year high of 5.2% to 3.4% in February), unemployment is rising at a reduced rate overall and consumer confidence has improved since the end of 2011.</p> <p>Nevertheless, consumers' purchasing power is still being squeezed appreciably as, despite falling back, consumer price inflation is currently still running well ahead of earnings growth. Indeed consumer price inflation of 3.4% in February compared with annual average earnings growth of just 0.7% in January. On top of this, unemployment is high and is still rising, debt levels are elevated and consumer confidence is still low compared to long-term norms despite the recent improvement.</p> <h2>Richard Driver, analyst for Caxton FX</h2> <p>This morning's UK retail sales figure certainly caught the market by surprise.

      "bodyText": "Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight There is a double whammy of bad news in the retail sales data with sales volumes falling by a much greater than expected 0.8% in February and January's increase being revised sharply down from 0.9% to 0.3%. It has to be said that the 0.3% rise in sales volumes in January is more in line with the survey evidence from the CBI and British Retail Consortium. The data puts a real dent in hopes that the consumer may be perking up appreciably and tempers hopes that GDP will see a relatively decent return to growth in the first quarter after the 0.2% contraction in GDP suffered in the fourth quarter of 2011. On the positive side, consumer price inflation has fallen back appreciably since peaking last September (from a three-year high of 5.2% to 3.4% in February), unemployment is rising at a reduced rate overall and consumer confidence has improved since the end of 2011. Nevertheless, consumers' purchasing power is still being squeezed appreciably as, despite falling back, consumer price inflation is currently still running well ahead of earnings growth. Indeed consumer price inflation of 3.4% in February compared with annual average earnings growth of just 0.7% in January. On top of this, unemployment is high and is still rising, debt levels are elevated and consumer confidence is still low compared to long-term norms despite the recent improvement. Richard Driver, analyst for Caxton FX This morning's UK retail sales figure certainly caught the market by surprise. We were confident spending was going to moderate significantly after December and January's bumper growth figures as that trajectory was never sustainable. Nonetheless, -0.8% month on month is very disappointing and the slight downward revision to the previous two months' figures is a reality check for the retail industry. The budget highlights that UK households are going to remain tightly squeezed for the rest of this year but with inflation falling and growth slowly picking up, there is room for optimism. It is not all doom and gloom, however, as some high street heavyweights like Next and Debenhams posted some decent profits recently and with the Olympics on the horizon, as well as the relaxing of Sunday trading laws, the UK retail sector could be in line for a much-needed boost. We were expecting to see surging petrol prices provide a boost to non-fuel sales as consumers look for more cost-effective ways to spend their money but this simply wasn't the case. John Ibbotson of the retail consultants Retail Vision While consumers are slightly more confident than they were this time last year, they're still erring on the side of caution. People are spending but they are spending at lower levels. Discretionary spend has been hit particularly hard. If people don't need something urgently, they'll do without it. And the more they do without it, the more they see they didn't actually need it. Just as we had an addiction to debt, now we're seeing a shift to thrift. On top of the economic downturn retailers are still coming to terms with the shift of consumers to online. As highlighted earlier this week, the internet has been hugely disruptive to many retailers. Sad as it is, the British high street is on borrowed time. Mary Portas is no Mary Poppins. Strong retail sales will return, but when they do come back it will be through online channels. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First foreign exchange We were always going to have a fall following last month's bumper 1.2% rise, but a dip of 0.8% has caused people to sit and wonder whether the economic revival at the beginning of 2012 is already coming to an end. We think not, but this doesn't change the fact that the consumer is facing a barrage of higher taxes, high inflation and increased fears over unemployment. It is our belief that a lot of the rise last month was as a result of price discounting and this month's dip was as a result of the festive price-cutting ending and shoppers counting the pennies a little more carefully. The fact that it follows a budget that was short on growth targeting measures will not go amiss, however. Annalisa Piazza of Newedge Strategy The outlook for first-quarter retail activity now looks more \"realistic\", re-aligned with the picture described by survey indicators. Retail sales have been boosted by generous discounts over December and January but the February report clearly shows a \"normalisation\" trend, consistent with the still sluggish economic picture for the UK activity. In details, the breakdown of the report shows a broad-based downward technical correction in February. Food sales fell by 0.1% month on month, following a -0.5% contraction in January. Non-food sales contracted by a deeper 1.5%, led by falling sales of clothes and footwear (-1.2% month on month), household goods stores (-1%) and other stores (-3%). All in all, household consumption is expected to move sideways over the quarter and prospects for the future are not much brighter. The labour market continues to deteriorate and average earnings run well below inflation at record low levels. Not the right environment to expect a substantial rebound any time soon.

      "bodyText": "Ireland ended last year in recession, according to figures released on Thursday, dealing a blow to the policy of economic austerity being forced on struggling eurozone countries by the European commission and the IMF. A dip of 0.2% in GDP in the last quarter of 2011 followed a steep fall in the third quarter, after an export drive was undermined by the slowdown in global demand. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. Ireland, which had become a poster child for austerity when its economy pulled out of its nosedive earlier last year, joins fellow eurozone countries Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal and Greece in recession. The Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, promised a swift recovery last year after record export figures appeared to show foreign trade would galvanise the economy, which had to be bailed out with \u20ac90bn by the European commission, IMF and European Central Bank in December 2010. However, the euro crisis and a slowdown in some key export markets dampened demand for Irish goods. Dublin has focused on exports after it was forced to impose a dramatic squeeze on public spending by Brussels as the price of a multibillion-euro rescue package. The housing crisis that resulted from the largest property boom in the eurozone has also restricted domestic demand. Such is the poor state of the Dublin government's finances that Irish central bank governor, Patrick Honohan, is expected to ask the ECB for permission to delay a cash payment on its banking debt. The state is due to make a \u20ac3.1bn (\u00a32.6bn) payment to the former Anglo Irish Bank, which is then supposed to use the funds to reduce its emergency borrowings from the country's central bank. Instead, Anglo Irish, which is a \"zombie\" bank closed to new business, may use the funds to buy a new Irish government bond, recycling the cash back to the state. The bond can then be used to tap funding from the ECB. Described as an accounting trick by some economists, it allows Dublin to use ECB money to prop up the bank rather than its own. Dublin faces some of the biggest debts from its banking crisis of any eurozone country after a splurge of lending in the boom years. The decision to nationalise all the major bank groups has landed the government with all their debts, which need to be serviced to avoid a default. Noonan is expected to focus on the growth in GDP over the whole year and the recovery in the fourth quarter from the 1.1% contraction in the third quarter, which was revised up from a previously disastrous 1.9% fall in output. Over the 12 months to December GDP rose by 0.7%, ending three successive years of declines that saw the economy shrink by a cumulative 10.4%. Analysts had expected GDP to rise by 0.4% in the final months of last year and 0.9% for the year as a whole, just shy of the 1% the government had pencilled into its fiscal plans. Gross national product, seen by some economists as a more accurate indicator of the state of the economy because it strips out the earnings of Irish-based multinationals, fell 2.2% in October-December, compared with a 1.5% increase expected by economists. Ireland's current account surplus came in at \u20ac796m in the fourth quarter. The Irish experience was reflected in figures showing that new orders for the eurozone's factory goods fell in January, as businesses struggled to put the worst of the debt crisis behind them and the cooling Chinese economy underscored the fragility of the bloc's recovery. Manufacturing orders in the 17 countries that share the euro fell 2.3% from December, the European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said on Thursday. The eurozone's sick economy was evident in the weak annual Eurostat data, as industrial orders fell 3.3% in January versus the same period a year ago, slightly worse than an expected fall of 3.0 percent. EU policymakers are betting that demand from the healthier economies of the US and China will pull the eurozone out of its second recession in three years at a time of job cuts and budget austerity at home that is doing little for growth. But surveys showing a second successive fall in manufacturing and services activity in March in the euro zone, released separately on Thursday, suggested that foreign demand is muted and may not be enough to help Europe. Rising oil prices could also become a stumbling block for growth as they force businesses to pay more for energy and limit their ability to compete and hire more staff. \"The economy stabilised at the start of the year but that doesn't mean there is going to be a strong recovery,\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING's senior economist for the euro zone. \"The surveys show you can't count your chickens before they hatch.\" China cut its growth target to 7.5% in 2012 from the 8% goal in each of the previous eight years, citing the European debt crisis and a shrinking market for its goods.",

      "bodyText": "The budget airline Ryanair has been severely criticised for failing to look after a stranded passenger following the 2010 eruption of an Icelandic volcano, in a ruling that imposes extra customer care responsibilities on airlines. The finding by the advocate general at the European court of justice is intended to ensure that travellers cannot be abandoned abroad even if flight disruption is beyond the control of an airline. \"It does not appear to be disproportionate to impose on air carriers such an obligation to provide care in so far as they are free to pass on the resulting costs to airline ticket prices,\" the advocate general, Yves Bot, said in a decision published on the court's website. \"That is a policy which has already been put into effect by Ryanair, which introduced a special levy in April 2011 in order to cover the costs incurred in providing care to passengers whose flights had been cancelled owing to the eruption of the Icelandic volcano.\" The case arose from a claim submitted by an Irish passenger, Denise McDonagh, whose flight from Faro to Dublin, scheduled for 17 April 2010, was cancelled because of the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland. Much of European airspace was closed between 15 and 23 April 2010 owing to the persistence of volcanic ash clouds. McDonagh was eventually able to return to Ireland on 24 April. She argued that Ryanair did not provide her with assistance and asked for \u20ac1,130 (\u00a3942) in damages, to cover the costs of meals, refreshments, accommodation and transport. The district court in Dublin referred the case to the court of justice, which interprets EU law to make sure it is applied uniformly across the community. Under EU regulations, airlines are bound to cover the cost of care during disruption due to \"extraordinary circumstances\" although they do not have to pay compensation for lost flights. Ryanair had argued that the closure of airspace due to volcanic ash went beyond extraordinary circumstances and that it should not be liable for looking after passengers. The ruling, however, said the disruption did constitute \"extraordinary circumstances\". \"The provision of care is particularly important in the case of extraordinary circumstances which persist over a long time,\" the advocate general said. \"It is precisely in situations where the waiting period occasioned by the cancellation of a flight is particularly lengthy that it is necessary to ensure that an air passenger, whose flight has been cancelled, can have access to essential goods and services throughout that period. \"A limitation of the obligation to provide care would in some measure deprive the EU legislation of its effectiveness, since after a few days the air passengers concerned would be abandoned to their fate.\" The finding by the advocate general will still have to be confirmed by the court. In the vast majority of cases the court follows his opinion.",

The news is a blow to the chancellor as he pins his hopes on a recovery this year to avoid recession and soften the impact of the coalition's cuts. His budget on Wednesday quickly came under fire for ushering in a tax cut for the super rich while taking money away from pensioners and some working families. Households have struggled with rising unemployment and with falling real incomes as their wages have failed to keep pace with inflation during Britain's lacklustre recovery. Underlining those pressures, the Office for National Statistics reported that retail sales volumes fell 0.8% on the month in February, the sharpest drop in nine months. They were a mere 1% higher than a year earlier, less than half the 2.5% growth forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. Analysts said the fall and downward revisions to sales growth in December and January cast doubt over any recovery suggested by company results and business surveys. \"February's UK retail sales figures leave the recovery on the high street looking a bit more fragile than it previously seemed,\" said Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics. \"With the budget doing little to ease the burden of the next round of austerity measures due to hit households in April, the high street recovery looks set to be short-lived again.\" The ONS said the February drop was driven by the sharpest fall for two years at \"other stores\", a category that includes jewellers, carpet stores, haberdashers and computer shops. Within that the biggest drop was in sales of fine art and antiques. In value terms, sales fell 0.4% in February, again the weakest performance since last May. The data echo a cautious outlook from retailers, although there have been reports of high street profits recovering in recent weeks. The head of Next, Britain's second largest clothing retailer, said earlier on Thursday he expected the UK consumer mood to remain subdued in 2012. \"I don't think things are going to get any worse than last year. They may get slightly better, but I don't think they're going to get a lot better,\" the company's chief executive, Simon Wolfson, said after reporting a 5% rise in profits last year. He said the benefit to the British consumer of falling inflation was being offset by unemployment and tight credit availability. He is also worried that a worsening of the eurozone debt crisis will hit UK consumer sentiment. Kingfisher, Europe's biggest home improvements retailer, was also wary about the short-term economic outlook but was confident of coping, thanks in part to improved margins on cheaper goods from China. Meanwhile, the longer term outlook for Britain's high streets remains uncertain, with a warning this week that four out of 10 shops will have to shut in the next five years as consumers turn their backs on traditional stores in favour of online shopping.
