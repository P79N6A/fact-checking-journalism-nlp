      "bodyText": "US stock markets closed down almost 2% on Friday following sharp falls across the world due to investors\u2019 renewed concern about the health of the global economy after the US Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates on hold. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 291.7 points (1.75%) to 16,383 points. The S&amp;P 500 lost 32.09 points (1.6%) to 1,958.11, and the Nasdaq fell 66.72 points (1.36%) to 4,827.23 points. The Fed\u2019s decision to leave US borrowing costs at 0-0.25% was in part a response to a market meltdown in August, but it received a cool reception from investors unsettled by the delay in tightening policy. Markets fell across most of the world, starting with a 2% fall in Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei index; the Dax in Germany lost 3%, France\u2019s CAC index closed down 2.5%, and the FTSE 100 lost 1.3%. Expectations of an interest rate increase from the Fed this week had diminished following the China-induced turmoil in markets in August, but investors had been braced for a signal from Washington that a move was likely soon. Instead, the Fed\u2019s chair, Janet Yellen, combined unchanged policy with a soft statement on Thursday that highlighted anxiety about the global economy. \u201cThe longer investors had to ruminate on Thursday\u2019s Fed statement the worse they seemed to take it, with the European indices widening their losses as the day went on,\u201d said Conner Campbell of spreadbetting firm SpreadEX. \u201cAn export-hurting rise in the euro-dollar was the main culprit.\u201d The euro gained a cent against the dollar to $1.143. Wall Street now believes the earliest date for a US rate rise is December, with many investors expecting a further delay into 2016. Paul Ashworth, US analyst at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe more the Fed procrastinates, the more we get the feeling that officials are fooling themselves into thinking that if they only just wait a little longer, all the uncertainty will clear up and they can raise interest rates with no danger of making a mistake. \u201cUnfortunately, the real world doesn\u2019t work like that. We now expect the Fed to delay the first rate hike until December, but it\u2019s possible that it will find another reason to wait until early 2016. Beyond that, however, the longer the Fed delays now, the higher interest rates will eventually have to go. Inflation is coming.\u201d Bill Strazzullo, chief strategist at market research firm Bell Curve Trading, said: \u201cIf growth in the strongest economy the United States isn\u2019t strong enough to raise rates even a quarter of point, what does that say about the prospects for global growth?\u201d The Fed\u2019s prevarication is seen as having a bearing on UK interest rates, since it is thought unlikely that the Bank of England will want to move first. \u201cThe Federal Reserve surprised market participants by combining a decision to leave interest rates unchanged with a dovish commentary and outlook,\u201d explained Guy Dunham of Baring Asset Management in London. \u201cPrior to the Fed decision, markets were looking positive but they now find themselves under pressure with global growth concerns weighing on sentiment,\u201d added Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at currency broker FXTM. The US has been the best performing of the world\u2019s major economies since the financial crash of 2007-09, but inflation remains well below the Fed\u2019s target while wage growth has been muted despite a fall in unemployment to its pre-recession levels. Even so, Wall Street believed the Fed was on the point of announcing the first increase in rates since 2006 as the first step in returning monetary policy to a more normal setting. Yellen, however, cited volatility triggered by the slowing Chinese economy as a reason for caution. \u201cThe outlook abroad appears to have become less certain,\u201d the Fed chairman said at a press conference announcing the decision. \u201cIn light of the heightened uncertainty abroad \u2026 the committee judged it appropriate to wait.\u201d Speculation that weaker global economic activity will affect demand for oil led to a 2% drop in the cost of crude, with Brent crude changing hands at $48 a barrel. Money also flowed into German government debt, a classic safe haven, driving down the yield on bunds. Risk aversion pushed the gold price up, meaning shares in gold producers bucked the trend on Friday. Marc Ostwald, of ADM Investor Services, accused Yellen of \u201cinjecting further unwanted uncertainty\u201d into the markets. \u201cIf the [Federal Open Market Committee] objective was to convey confusion, it has succeeded, thereby ploughing a deep furrow of instability and destabilisation, and shining a very bright light on the large debt and liquidity trap it and other G7 central banks have spent seven years crafting,\u201d he said. However, Anne Richards, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management, said the Fed made the right call. \u201cRight now, there is not a compelling reason to raise interest rates in the US,\u201d she told Bloomberg TV.",

      "bodyText": "US stock markets closed down almost 2% on Friday following sharp falls across the world due to investor\u2019s renewed concern about the health of the global economy after the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decided to leave American interest rates on hold. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 291.7 points ( or 1.75%) to 16,383 points. The S&amp;P 500 lost 32.09 points (or 1.6%) to 1,958.11 and the Nasdaq fell 66.72 points (1.36%) to 4,827.23 points. You can also read our updated news story here: Over in Athens tonight, Syriza has held a pre-election rally where Padomes leader Pablo Iglesias has just addressed the crowd with the opening line: \u201cI will speak in Spanish because in Berlin they have to learn what Spanish and Greek sounds like!\u201d He then went on to liken Tsipras to \u201ca lion ... Noone has ever tried to defend your rights like Alexis.\u201d The US Federal Reserve may have left interest rates unchanged but the central bank\u2019s cautious comments about the outlook for the global economy sent shudders through global markets. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG said: \u201cMarkets can be a fickle thing. Going into last night\u2019s Fed meeting, talk revolved around how damaging a rate hike would be to equity markets. It turns out that no hike can also be rather problematic, especially when accompanied by a sober statement and downgrades to economic forecasts. As a result, stocks moved swiftly into the red this morning and have stayed there all day.\u201d European markets were harder hit than the UK, with the weaker dollar pushing the euro higher and causing concern for European exporters. So the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 82.88 points or 1.34% lower at 6104.11 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 3.06% to 9916.16 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.56% lower at 4535.85 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.65% to 21,514.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.57% lower at 9847.2 In Greece, ahead of the weekend\u2019s election, the Athens market added 0.76% to 697.57 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 235 points or 1.42%. On that note we\u2019ll close for the moment, but should be back to catch the Wall Street close. Meanwhile, thanks for all your comments. Christopher Vecchio, Currency Analyst at DailyFX, confirms that a US rate hike this side of Christmas is now less likely than before: The implied probability of a rate hike in October, per the Fed funds futures contract, dropped from near 45% yesterday to 18% today; for December, from above 60% yesterday to 26% today. Some analysts are arguing today that the Fed has created a new \u2018third mandate\u2019, on top of its existing dual duties to deliver price stability and maximum employment. Jeremy Zirin, chief equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management, says (via Reuters) \u201cInvestors are wrestling with how concerned they should be regarding global growth.\u201d \u201cThe Fed has introduced a quasi third mandate about the global growth, apart from the labor market and inflation.\u201d That means added uncertainty, which usually equals falling stock markets.... Every major stock market is in the red, with the exception of the Australian and Hong Kong indices which closed many hours ago before the rout got underway. Perhaps we can file today in the \u2018inexplicable market reaction\u2019 box. Bond trading veteran Bill Gross says the Fed made the right call last night, given financial market conditions. Speaking on Bloomberg TV right now, Gross suggests that the current era of non-standard monetary policy could last for another five or ten years. That would allow the problems created during the \u2018fat\u2019 decades of debt-driven growth pre-Lehman Brothers to be worked off, he argues. Gross concedes through that asset prices are simply too high, partly because they\u2019re being priced against record low US interest rates and German bond yields. Ultimately, there has to be a rebalance if capitalism itself is to rebalance, Gross added. US markets have followed the rest of the world lower after the Federal Reserve\u2019s concerns about economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost more than 200 points or 1.2% in early trading, while the FTSE 100 is now 1.6% lower and Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 3.49%, with investors worried about euro strength against a weaker dollar hitting European exporters. The Wall Street opening bell has been rung, and the New York stock market is open for business. The scale of today\u2019s selloff is a little surprising, given that the markets didn\u2019t really expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates rates yesterday. But they also didn\u2019t expect the Fed to be quite so gloomy about the global economy. That dovishness is making investors around the globe reassess the prospects of a rate hike. Guy Dunham of Baring Asset Management in London explains: Federal Reserve slightly surprised market participants by combining a decision to leave interest rates where they are with dovish language, and revised down their median short and long-term expectations by 0.25%. Investors who hold risky assets are particularly uneasy, he adds, given the confusion over the timing of any rate hike. Here\u2019s a reminder of how rate expectations have been pushed back: The Fed decision sparked a small rally in some emerging markets, but nothing sensational. India\u2019s Sensex index jumped 2% earlier today, on relief that US rates hadn\u2019t been hiked. The optimism has faded, though, with the index up just 1% in late trading. Viktor Shvets, head of Asian strategy at Macquarie Securities, predicts that the optimism won\u2019t last. He told CNBC: \u201cI think in the short-term, emerging markets will be supported because the Federal Reserve didn\u2019t tighten. Basically, there\u2019s little bit less pressure for U.S. dollar to appreciate, a little bit more liquidity. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some relief particularly, in places like Indonesia, Malaysia, up to places like Brazil, South Africa, Russia. Will it last? The answer is no.\u201d Traders heading to Wall Street this morning should take their best tin hat. Now this is curious. Someone in the City has sold shares in two blue chip heavyweights, BP and HSBC, way below the market value. Shares in both companies briefly dropped by almost 5%, before swiftly rebounding. It\u2019s probably a \u2018fat-fingered trade\u2019, where someone presses the wrong button. But two at the same time suggests something went badly awry. Andy Haldane\u2019s fascinating speech (online here) also outlines how Britain could introduce a tax on money. That would encourage people to spend, pushing up inflation, and avoiding the problem that it\u2019s hard to cut UK interest rates much lower. Another option is to embrace an electronic currency like Bitcoin, which Haldane says has \u201creal potential\u201d. If paper currency were then abolished altogether, it would be possible to impose negative interest rates on deposits. As Haldane puts it: What I think is now reasonably clear is that the distributed payment technology embodied in Bitcoin has real potential. On the face of it, it solves a deep problem in monetary economics: how to establish trust \u2013 the essence of money \u2013 in a distributed network. Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cblockchain\u201d technology appears to offer an imaginative solution to that distributed trust problem. Whether a variant of this technology could support central bank-issued digital currency is very much an open question. So too is whether the public would accept it as a substitute for paper currency. Central bank-issued digital currency raises big logistical and behavioural questions too. How practically would it work? What security and privacy risks would it raise? And how would public and privately-issued monies interact? The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist is trending on Twitter after warning that the UK recovery is weakening, and may need a rate cut not a hike. The editor of the FT is leading the charge: The European selloff is gathering pace, led by Germany\u2019s DAX index. The strengthening euro, and new confusion over when the Fed might hike rates, are proving to be a nasty cocktail for traders across Europe. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The longer investors had to ruminate on Thursday\u2019s Fed statement the worse they seemed to take it, with the European indices widening their losses as the day went on. An export-hurting rise in the euro-dollar was the main culprit, with the currency pairing jumping by around 0.4% as the morning continued. And with US stocks heading for a bath too, all the main European indices have shed at least 1%. The DAX is down 2.9%, back below the 10,000 point mark at 9,933. And here\u2019s a reminder of how the euro jumped last night, when the Fed decision came. The futures market is now suggesting chunky falls on Wall Street when trading begins, in two hours time. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist is reiterating his opposition to an interest rate hike in the near future and says policy could just as easily be loosened as tightened if the UK is hurt by turmoil in emerging markets. Andy Haldane is using a speech to business owners in Northern Ireland to discuss events in the Greek economy and in China, where an economic slowdown has coincided with a stock market rout and sent jitters through global markets. Haldane, one of nine policymakers that vote on interest rates at the Bank, reiterated warnings he made earlier this year that the UK economy was not ready for higher borrowing costs. Haldane\u2019s comments put him at odds with other members of the monetary policy committee, who have been talking up the strength of the UK economy and its ability to withstand contagion from slowing emerging markets. \u201cIn my view, the balance of risks to UK growth, and to UK inflation at the two-year horizon, is skewed squarely and significantly to the downside,\u201d Haldane said in the speech to the Portadown Chamber of Commerce. \u201cAgainst that backdrop, the case for raising UK interest rates in the current environment is, for me, some way from being made.\u201d Haldane said it was unclear how much the UK would be affected by the slowdown in emerging nations, significant drivers of global growth in recent years. But he said there were significant risks of contagion given the growing clout of developing economies in recent years. Added to that, Haldane highlighted challenges in the UK. \u201cWhile the UK\u2019s recovery remains on track, there are straws in the wind to suggest slowing growth into the second half of the year. Employment is softening, with a fall in employment in the second quarter and surveys suggesting slowing growth rates. Surveys of output growth, in manufacturing, construction and possibly services, have also recently weakened. All of these data were taken prior to recent emerging market economy wobbles,\u201d he said. Given those risks, there was no case right now for hiking, he said, concluding: \u201cOne reason not to do so is that, were the downside risks I have discussed to materialise, there could be a need to loosen rather than tighten the monetary reins as a next step to support UK growth and return inflation to target.\u201d Janet Yellen doesn\u2019t want to go down in history as the Fed chair who plunged the global economy into recession, and the US with it. So explains Anne Richards, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management. She believes the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setting committee was right to leave interest rates unchanged Richards told Bloomberg TV that raw economic data simply doesn\u2019t provide a compelling reason to hike rates. If the Fed moves too quickly, it \u201ccould make 2016 much uglier from an economic perspective\u201d. Richards added that the Fed has now looked \u201cbeyond its borders\u201d to survey the global economy, and concluded that the outlook for next year isn\u2019t as rosy as they thought. Wall Street is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead lower, when the New York stock exchange opens in just over three hours. After Janet Yellen\u2019s dovish performance last night, investors have all-but discounted the chances that interest rates will be hiked at October\u2019s meeting. And there\u2019s much less confidence that the Fed will raise rates before the end of the year. There\u2019s now more chance that the first hike comes in 2016. The Bond Vigilantes team at M&amp;G have kindly tweeted the key charts: Yikes. The German DAX is now down almost 2%. The selloff is driven by fears that Germany\u2019s exporters will be thumped by the renewed strength of the euro against the US dollar. Top fallers include carmakers BMW and Daimler, chemical giant BASF, and industrial conglomerate ThyssenKrupp. Traders need to fasten their seat belts for a period of high volatility, warns Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group. She explains that economic data will be scrutinised more tightly than ever, thanks to the Fed\u2019s new concern about the global economy. The inflation in China and the unemployment in the Eurozone will be as important as onion prices in India and dairy product sales volume in New Zealand. Given the dull economic fundamentals across the globe, it may be hard for the Fed to take the first step before the end of the year. It will be even harder for the market to assess a consensus and to come up with expectations. Gold miners are benefitting from the Fed\u2019s reluctance to raise interest rates, reports my colleague Nick Fletcher: Janet Yellen\u2019s concerns about the Chinese economy has undermined leading shares, despite the Federal Reserve chair announcing on Thursday that US interest rates would remain on hold. The worries about the outlook for the global economy have pushed mining shares lower, although precious metal miners are shining on hopes that the Fed decision will weaken the dollar - which is already happening - and lift gold prices. So Randgold Resources has risen 118p to \u00a338.47 and Fresnillo is 17p better at 607p. HSBC\u2019s chief economist reminds us that we\u2019ve been expecting a US rate rise \u201csoon\u201d for a long time. The German stock market is continuing to weaken, now down around 1.3% today. Britain\u2019s interest rates could now remain lower for longer, thanks to the Fed, argues RBS\u2019s economics team. They point out that the two policy rates usually rack each other quite closely, due to a) the amount of trade between the two countries, and b) the US\u2019s pre-eminent position. The Bank of England is also likely to favour waiting for the Fed to hike first. RBS also pulled together four charts to explain why the Fed didn\u2019t hike (from this Powerpoint presentation): The Federal Reserve has knocked confidence in the global economy by leaving interest rates unchanged and sounding so cautious, argues Jameel Ahmad, FXTM chief market analyst. The indication from the Federal Reserve that global economic weakness played a major factor in delaying a US interest rate rise strongly weakens the possibility of an interest rate rise at all this year. Global growth concerns are a reoccurring theme as current suggestions strongly point towards economic momentum in China continuing to slow even further next year. Both the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and European Central Bank (ECB) are going to find themselves under increasing pressure to reinvigorate economic momentum, and the emerging markets remain vulnerable to further weakness. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services is fuming about the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to leave rates unchanged, and sound rather dovish about inflation and China. He points out that the Fed raised its growth forecasts, and lowered its unemployment projection, clearing the way for a rate hike. Instead, weaker global conditions were cited as a reason to ignore these forecasts. Ostwald says: If the FOMC\u2019s objective was to convey confusion, it has succeeded, thereby ploughing a deep furrow of instability and destabilization, and shining a very bright light on the large debt and liquidity trap it and other G7 central banks have spent 7 years crafting. Eurozone stock markets are suffering because the euro has rallied against the dollar overnight. That\u2019s bad for exporters in France and Germany. It may also have spoiled Mario Draghi\u2019s breakfast. The ECB president managed to weaken the euro earlier this month by hinting at further stimulus measures. Maybe he\u2019ll have to deliver soon. The dollar has just hit a three-week low against major currencies, down 0.2%. That reflects the chance that US interest rates may not rise until next year. Germany and France\u2019s main stock indices have both fallen over 1% in early trading, echoing the selloff in London. Investors in Frankfurt and Paris aren\u2019t impressed by Janet Yellen\u2019s dovish performance last night, where the Fed chief warned that the slowing Chinese economy could \u201crestrain US economic activity somewhat\u201d. That\u2019s encouraging investors to sell shares, and pile into safe assets including German bunds (see 7.55am) Here\u2019s the damage across Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning: You might think that ultra-low interest rates would boost stock markets in Europe. But traders are worried that Janet Yellen sounded quite concerned about low inflation and the global economy at last night\u2019s press conference. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: Markets had anticipated either a dovish hike (easy does it) or a hawkish hold (be prepared) [but got neither]. While markets had desired clarity, it appears that uncertainty (and volatility) may be here to stay (December hike, Jan, later?). And we\u2019re off! Europe\u2019s stock markets are open, allowing traders to give their verdict on last night\u2019s Federal Reserve decision. As predicted, shares are dropping in London, with the FTSE 100 losing 33 points or 0.5% to 6153. Other European indices are also dipping, as the relief rally that began in Asia peters out.... Wendell Perkins, senior portfolio manager for Manulife Asset Management, reckons US interest rates will probably remain at their record lows until next year. Perkins also predicts more volatility as the markets react to last night\u2019s Fed decision. Investors need to consider a) When are they going to raise, b) what are they afraid of, and c) how worried are they about conditions in the global economy, he told Bloomberg TV. Money is pouring into German government bonds this morning. This is pushing down the yield (or interest rate) on debt issued by Europe\u2019s largest member. That\u2019s often a sign of anxiety in the markets. Good morning all. There\u2019s a subdued feel in the City today, after the Fed disappointed those hoping that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates last night. The decision wasn\u2019t a shock (as we blogged yesterday, the markets suggested only a 32% chance of a hike). But some investors are now fretting about why Janet Yellen and the rest of the FOMC held borrowing costs at record lows again. It\u2019s slightly ironic. Traders don\u2019t want the flow of cheap money to end, but they\u2019re also worried that central bankers feel the need to keep replenishing the punchbowl. As London CapitalGroup dealer Jonathan Sudaria puts it: \u201cYes, we\u2019ve got a reprieve on an immediate interest rate hike, but thereason for the stay of execution is rather bearish itself.\u201d And that\u2019s why the main European stock markets are expected to dip in early trading. I\u2019m handing over now to my colleague Graeme Wearden who is poised at his work station in London. Thanks for joining me. Back in Asia, the Nikkei is still in the doldrums while the other major bourses perform pretty well on the prospect of cheaper money. But in Japan a delay in the US hike has served to strengthen the yen, which is bad for exports and for stock markets. Only a weakening yen will bring relief to the Nikkei according to Capital Economics\u2019 Julian Jessop, who said in a note: The single most important driver of equity performance in the next year or so is likely to be renewed weakness in the yen. He sees the prospect of more QE from the Bank of Japan and a rate hike by the Fed as the two main factors to that situation around. IG seeing European markets opening down, but only slightly. The French finance minister, Michel Sapin, is in Beijing and he\u2019s being polite about the state of the Chinese economy. It\u2019s a real concern for a lot of people, including America\u2019s finest economic brains. But Sapin said he sees no particularly significant risk from recent stock market turbulence and the recent fall was a \u201cnecessary correction\u201d, Reuters reports. Opinion still mixed on whether the Fed move was the correct one. Chris Weston from IG in Melbourne has delivered his verdict on the day\u2019s events and his view is that the Fed was as dovish as it could possibly have been and would have gone for a rise if it had not been for the August turmoil in China. It seems logical the central bank would have raised rates if it weren\u2019t for recent international developments, but they tried desperately to buy themselves flexibility. And as he says in conclusion, it could get interesting in Europe today despite the fairly muted response in Asia: It promises to be a very interesting session in Europe and the US, as traders have time to really assess the Fed\u2019s view and what it means for markets. As always, the first move might not be the right move and cooler heads should prevail. Time for a quick recap on the day\u2019s main news here in Asia Pacific: The region\u2019s markets have reacted positively to the Fed\u2019s inaction, except the Nikkei in Japan which is down 1.42%. The Shanghai Composite is just about to restart after a lunch break but is up 0.4%. The Hang Seng is up 0.42% and the ASX200 is 0.83% European markets are expected to open higher The chief of Australia\u2019s central bank says the Fed will hike rates \u201cby Christmas\u201d The US dollar slipped back against Asian currencies, slipping to a three-week low against the euro and a basket of currencies Chinese house prices edged up for the fourth month in a row As dawn breaks over Europe this is a good time to see what\u2019s happening with the futures markets. And it looks like the main markets will be up with FTSE predicted to open up 0.32%, the DAX in Germany up 0.26% and the CAC in paris up 0.32%. Looks like the jury is still well and truly out on whether China\u2019s economy is going to have a hard or soft landing as it decends from the heights of double digit growth. One of the reasons the Fed gave for keeping on hold were \u201cheightened concerns\u201d about the global economy in the wake the sharp selloff on Chinese stock markets in August and whether that means China can keep driving global growth as it has helped to do since the GFC. Developments we saw in financial markets in August partly reflected concerns of downside risk to Chinese economic performance and the deftness with which policymakers are addressing those concerns. If you want to see her full press conference, here it is: Today\u2019s most interesting data comes from China where home prices inched upwards for a fourth consecutive month in August. Average new home prices inched up 0.3% in August from the previous month, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the national statistics bureau on Friday, the same pace as in July. But Reuters reported that the Chinese property market \u2013 source of many concerns about the health of the economy \u2013 would not be booming again any time soon. Analysts do not expect a full-blown turnaround any time soon, as a huge overhang of unsold homes discourages new construction and investment in all but the biggest cities. Back to the markets then and the Japanese stock market has started up again after the lunch break. The Nikkei is still down though at 18,170, a fall of -1.4%. Elsewhere it seems reasonably calm. In fact you could say the S&amp;P/ASX200 here in Australia is having a good day. It is standing at 5,189 points, a rise of 0.8% on the day. The Shanghai Composite in China is up 0.4% at lunch. Stevens\u2019 testimony before the House of Representatives economics committee was wide-ranging. he also spoke about how he thinks the Australian economy will weather the headwinds facing China which Janet Yellen is so concerned about. Whether that financial volatility itself will serve further to dampen global growth prospects remains to be seen. Sometimes such events portend a wider set of economic events, but just as often, they don\u2019t. There is still a pretty good chance that we will come out of this episode fairly well, and much better than we came out of previous episodes of this type. Glenn Stevens, the governor of the Reserve Bank, has weighed into the debate today. Despite suggestions that the Fed might now not raise until 2016, he thinks it will raise rates before Christmas. That means either at its October meeting or in December. Speaking at a parliamentary hearing in Canberra, he said: I would still think an increase in the Fed funds rate is probably going to happen this year. The majority of FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] members still think that they\u2019re likely to start raising this year, there\u2019s two meetings left. Glenn Stevens, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, has been giving evidence today to a parliamentary committee. He has an optimistic view of the economy and thinks it can weather the headwinds threatening China and which are worrying Janet Yellen so much. Stevens told the House of Representatives economics committee in Canberra: There is still a pretty good chance that we will come out of this episode fairly well, and much better than we came out of previous episodes of this type. In the period ahead if we can get the non-resources part of the economy to keep improving gradually, build some confidence ... then we\u2019ll get the unemployment rate to come down. We ought be looking to get back into the fives over time, and given enough time I think we will, unless we\u2019re hit by a bad shock somewhere [NB it\u2019s currently 6.2%]. Nine years is a long time in global economics. Check out that gold price. As mentioned below, the Australian dollar has benefited from the expectation that US borrowing costs would stay on hold and rein in the long march of the greenback. As a result it has rallied around 2c in the past week or so since sinking to a new six-year low and this afternoon is buying US71.95c. Early on Friday it spiked to US72.76c, its highest level since August 24. Here\u2019s some more reaction. It is not in doubt that the Fed intends to raise rates, but the question that has obsessed economists and investors for the past couple of years has always been the timing. For Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Thursday night\u2019s decision shows that the Fed has become ultra-cautious and does not want to risk hiking rates if it has to reduce them again because the recovery is not strong enough. You can read his full article here but this is the main thrust: This is the weakest recovery the world\u2019s biggest economy has experienced in modern times and even now, more than six years after the trough of the recession, there are mixed signals. The Fed is not entirely convinced that it is party time for the US economy. The Fed is also weighing up the implications of a US interest rate increase on emerging markets, and in particular whether the prospect of higher US yields will intensify capital flows out of countries such as China and Brazil. So when will rates rise? When there is a further improvement in the jobs market and when the Fed is \u201creasonably confident\u201d that inflation is on course to move back up to 2%. Not yet, in other words. Markets-wise it has been a bit mixed. The expectation was for a hold so the semi-rally in stocks and currencies suchas the Australian dollar in recent days showed that the decision has been priced in. However, there has still been a bit of action, notably in Japan where the Nikkei plunged on the opening before fighting back. Here are the scores so far: Nikkei down 1.39% Shanghai Composite down 0.15% S&amp;P/ASX200 up 0.41% Hang Seng up 0.39% Kospi up 0.52% Good afternoon/morning and welcome to the markets live blog following the Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates near zero. You can read how the action unfolded here as relayed by my colleagues Graeme Wearden and Jane Kasperkevic. But the main takeaway seems to be that the very dovish comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen suggests that she and her fellow committee members might wait until next year to increase borrowing costs. here\u2019s the verdict of the world\u2019s biggest bond trading company, Pimco.",

Employment is softening, with a fall in employment in the second quarter and surveys suggesting slowing growth rates. Surveys of output growth, in manufacturing, construction and possibly services, have also recently weakened. All of these data were taken prior to recent emerging market economy wobbles,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Given those risks, there was no case right now for hiking, he said, concluding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cOne reason not to do so is that, were the downside risks I have discussed to materialise, there could be a need to loosen rather than tighten the monetary reins as a next step to support UK growth and return inflation to target.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/statuses/644829769310334976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How low can you go? - speech by Andrew Haldane <a href=\"http://t.co/w3rPTP8fJq\">http://t.co/w3rPTP8fJq</a></p>&mdash; Bank of England (@bankofengland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/status/644829769310334976\">September 18, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55fbcc69e4b022a8812f2fbf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-18T10:32:19.426Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Anne Richards: Fed was right to hold fire</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6613f12f8c9af6c00bec627066ee40199dfba1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6613f12f8c9af6c00bec627066ee40199dfba1b/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yellen holds a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington<br>Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen holds a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington September 17, 2015.

You can read his full article <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/17/us-interest-rates-still-time-for-another-drink-to-help-get-the-party-going\">here</a> but this is the main thrust:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is the weakest recovery the world\u2019s biggest economy has experienced in modern times and even now, more than six years after the trough of the recession, there are mixed signals. The Fed is not entirely convinced that it is party time for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>.<br><br>The Fed is also weighing up the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/fed-rates-hike-emerging-markets-nouriel-roubini\">implications of a US interest rate increase on emerging markets</a>, and in particular whether the prospect of higher US yields will intensify capital flows out of countries such as China and Brazil.<br><br>So when will rates rise? When there is a further improvement in the jobs market and when the Fed is \u201creasonably confident\u201d that inflation is on course to move back up to 2%. Not yet, in other words.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55fb7888e4b022a8812f2f37\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-18T02:58:05.499Z\">3.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets-wise it has been a bit mixed. The expectation was for a hold so the semi-rally in stocks and currencies suchas the Australian dollar in recent days showed that the decision has been priced in.</p> <p>However, there has still been a bit of action, notably in Japan where the Nikkei plunged on the opening before fighting back. </p> <p>Here are the scores so far:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Nikkei down 1.39%<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Shanghai Composite down 0.15%</strong></li> <li><strong>S&amp;P/ASX200 up 0.41%</strong></li> <li><strong>Hang Seng up 0.39%</strong></li> <li><strong>Kospi up 0.52%</strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55fb748ae4b022a8812f2f35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-18T02:35:33.638Z\">3.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good afternoon/morning and welcome to the markets live blog following the <strong>Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates near zero.</strong></p> <p>You can read how the action unfolded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/sep/17/us-federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-markets-janet-yellen-live\">here</a> as relayed by my colleagues Graeme Wearden and Jane Kasperkevic.

Trading in nine companies \u2013 including banking group HSBC and oil company BP - was suspended for five minutes on Friday following a trade order that was executed at 12.44. The move came in an already-volatile dealing session following the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Thursday to hold off raising interest rates. London\u2019s blue-chip share index was immediately pulled 1% lower \u2013 losing around 60 points or equivalent to around \u00a315bn in value - although it regained those losses within minutes. There was no immediate explanation for the dramatic drop but traders were describing it as a fat finger case, where a market professional makes a mistake in their order. As well as HSBC and BP, shares in tobacco company BAT, drinks group Diageo, National Grid, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, BT and Vodafone were subjected to the LSE\u2019s circuit breakers, a five-minute trading pause to allow trading to normalise. The companies were caught up in a basket trade order, the LSE said, where a number of stocks are traded at one time. The loss to the unidentified trader behind the transaction was estimated at around \u00a3500,000 on the basis of volumes traded on the London Stock Exchange. \u201cSystems worked as they should with certain stocks entering an automated trading period, with continuous trading resuming following that,\u201d the stock exchange said. The impact was dramatic on HSBC which fell almost 5% before recovering as soon as the circuit-breaking session was completed. The wider FTSE index ultimately ended the day 82 points lower, or down 1.3%, at 6,104. HSBC, one of the biggest stocks in the index, has been caught up in a fat finger incident before. In January 2014 it jumped nearly 10% in a few minutes, in a trade which was estimated to have lost the trader around \u00a3400,000. On the same day, Diageo\u2019s shares suddenly jumped 11%. Last year, orders in 42 companies on Japan\u2019s stock exchange such as Sony, Honda and Nomura \u2013 worth 67.78tn yen (\u00a3380bn) were cancelled before they could be traded. But not all sudden market moves can be blamed on fat fingers. Sometimes automated systems, guided by computer algorithms, are blamed. The London stock market had been trading for the first time since the Fed cited concerns about the health of the global economy after deciding not to raise US interests for the first time since 2006.",

    "webTitle": "Wow: Iceland's latest low-cost airline offers a \u00a399 bridge to the US", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Iceland has not always been kind to people wishing to fly, or even those searching for the best online deal. Savers attracted by high interest rates had billions in their Icesave bank accounts temporarily frozen in 2008. Two years later, ash spewed by the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano grounded planes across Europe for a week. So an Icelandic tech tycoon promising to fly bargain-hunting Brits to the US for \u00a399 one-way on his upstart airline might ring a few alarm bells. Sk\u00fali Mogensen\u2019s Wow Air is hoping to lure more people to Reykjavik from the UK \u2013 or more accurately, to pass through Keflavik airport for an hour or two. Its fleet of six short-haul planes is connecting London Gatwick, as well as Paris, Amsterdam and other European cities, with the eastern seaboard of the US. And in the era of low-cost aviation, it is hoping that a sub-\u00a3100 fare will will make an unconventional transatlantic crossing more attractive. How will Mogensen, 47, a former philosophy dropout with a Bransonesque style, make the sums work? He is wearily familiar with the aviation industry joke of how to make a million (you start an airline with double that amount). In its fourth year, Wow is turning profitable, he says, although no accounts are published: financing came from \u201cmy left pocket\u201d. Mogensen made his money in technology, selling mobile messaging software around the world and eventually selling one company, Oz Communications, to Nokia in 2008 to generate enough capital to start an airline. \u201cEveryone thought I was crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told me you know nothing about running an airline. True, but I know a lot about the internet. And I love the fact that a small airline in Iceland with our small office can compete.\u201d The business plan is for low-cost airline operations, grabbing online customers through cheap fares, but extended to the lucrative transatlantic route \u2013 a plan enabled by Iceland\u2019s potential as a staging post for flights to north America. Instead of direct flights on wide-body aircraft designed for long-range travel for several hundred passengers with full catering and entertainment, Wow does two short hops in the same kind of Airbus planes used by EasyJet \u2013 which typically seat between 180 and 220 passengers. Price is everything, Mogensen says. \u201cYou ask people what\u2019s important to them and they say things like seat pitch \u2013 but when they go online to book they don\u2019t get any information like that: 80% of passengers just go for price. \u201cThat\u2019s the principal driving factor for the consumer, so it\u2019s all about how you position yourself on the internet. Make sure you appear first on all the online travel agencies, then you\u2019re in business.\u201d Wow appears to be achieving this on Google Flights and Skyscanner for several routes: apparently substantially undercutting the nearest rivals on certain days, and frequently cheapest for those prepared to take connecting flights and be flexible on travel dates. Google found a \u00a3274 return on Wow for London-Washington leaving 15 October, compared to that day\u2019s next cheapest \u00a3498 on KLM (connecting) or \u00a3541 on Virgin (direct); as little as \u00a3249 return departing November 11 to Boston (then \u00a3411 on Virgin). But for fixed autumn dates, while the likes of British Airways and Virgin were still returning a price between \u00a3390 and \u00a3500, cheap Wow fares were often nowhere to be seen. Furthermore, Wow has only recently reissued its headline-grabbing \u00a399 outbound fares from Europe to the US; it costs more coming back. And the fare is not available at all after the spring, costing \u00a3479 one-way from June. Extras drive the cost up further, including a booking fee and notably tight baggage allowances: a maximum carry-on weight of 5kg rules out the kind of case most transatlantic passengers would want. A 12kg carry-on costs \u00a328, a 20kg bag in the hold \u00a339 each way. Throw in food and drink over four flights and the savings look less keen. Mogensen admits: \u201cNo one will buy a Wow Air ticket if it\u2019s the second cheapest. The internet tells us, every day, every second \u2013 it\u2019s a brutal boss.\u201d How sustainable is it to sell the cheapest tickets? This marketing tactic was claimed last year by Bj\u00f8rn Kjos, the chief executive of the budget carrier Norwegian, who said low fares were enough to market his airline when it launched a transatlantic service from Gatwick with \u00a3199 fares. Mogensen says: \u201cObviously, you have to have a cost-conscious business.\u201d Planes are filled and used intensively, he adds, and his \u201cstartup\u201d does not have the costs affecting legacy carriers \u2013 a line that is generally airline CEO code for lower wages \u2013 but claims Wow employs none of the controversial tactics of some rivals. Unlike Ryanair, crew do not have to buy their own uniform. Norwegian courted controversy by hiring Thai crew on longhaul routes; Mogensen says Wow employs Icelandic staff on local terms and conditions, and crew and airline pay taxes there. Mogensen talks boldly of expanding Wow\u2019s transatlantic market share to 10% by 2020, an eight-fold increase in the airline\u2019s 750,000 annual passengers, more than half of which are on connecting flights. The name Wow was deliberately global rather than hinting at its north Atlantic island base which arguably gives Wow its most salient competitive advantage. But other dreams have foundered on that rocky outcrop: Wow has partly grown from the ruins of Iceland Express, whose own efforts to crack the same market ended in failure. Analysts are cautious about its prospects. John Strickland, an aviation consultant, says: \u201cMost airlines have found it easier to fill seats profitably this year, aided by low fuel prices. The transatlantic routes market is known for its lucrative profit potential but it can equally be a graveyard: it\u2019s possible to make money in the summer only to bleed to death in the winter. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s an interesting model. But it\u2019s early days, and the recent experience of low-cost longhaul businesses isn\u2019t promising: AirAsia X [the biggest such airline in Asia] is wrestling with big losses; Norwegian also turned in a very big loss for 2014. It\u2019s not a surprise to fill a daily New York service out of Gatwick as it\u2019s a vast market. Picking thinner routes, to destinations like Baltimore and Washington, is much more challenging.\u201d Mogensen returned to Iceland from Canada in 2009, having made his fortune in the Nokia sale just as his homeland suffered its financial crash: \u201cInstead of celebrating, I saw my friends and family were being very hard hit.\u201d Pouring his money into Wow may have cost him somewhat more, but he says he is optimistic: \u201cI like to call it an investment.\u201d Transatlantic trailblazers Freddie Laker The founder of Laker Airways tried to take on the big boys with cheap and cheerful flights to the US, but after years of battling for legislative approval, his airline went bankrupt in 1982 as British Airways and US carriers conspired to undercut his fares. Bj\u00f8rn Kjos Currently running Norwegian\u2019s supposed lower-cost operation out of Gatwick after launching with \u00a3199 fares to New York and LA, but other airline fares can be cheaper and they are struggling with losses even in a boom year. Michael O\u2019Leary? The Ryanair way is one many have tried to emulate, and O\u2019Leary has long discussed extending flights across the pond \u2013 but says he would need different planes, and hints that the no-frills approach would change in a longhaul operation.",

Haldane warned in a speech on Friday, that we may be locked into what he calls a \u201cthree-part crisis trilogy\u201d, with part I, the Anglo-Saxon crisis of 2008-09, and part II, the euro crisis, about to be followed by part III, the emerging market crisis of 2015 onwards.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s productivity gap with other G7 nations has widened to its largest since estimates began in 1991, according to official figures. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that the output per hour from UK workers in 2014 fell to 20 percentage points below the average of other leading industrialised nations. The figures underscore the challenge for the chancellor, George Osborne, who has made raising the UK\u2019s poor productivity growth a priority. On the latest estimates, only Japan in the G7 performed worse than the UK last year in terms of output per hour worked. The UK was behind France, Germany and the US by 32-33 percentage points. Employment is at a record high, according to official figures this week, but the challenge for policymakers and businesses is getting more output out of each hour worked. On an output per worker basis, UK productivity was also 20 percentage points below the average for the rest of the G7 in 2014, the ONS said. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the government was \u201ccommitted to delivering a return to productivity growth which is the route to raising living standards for everyone in the UK.\u201d \u201cThe reforms set out in our productivity plan - Fixing the Foundations - will deliver a step change that will increase long term investment in people, capital and ideas and help to realise the ambitions of hard working people.\u201d In July, the business secretary, Sajid Javid, announced a mix of deregulation and government intervention across housing, apprenticeships, skills, universities, transport and finance in an effort to address \u201cthe economic challenge of our age\u201d - the UK\u2019s poor productivity performance. But responding to the latest figures, TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said the government\u2019s upcoming spending review and plans for more austerity did not bode well for the UK\u2019s competitiveness. \u201cWe need a better economic plan focused on higher public investment in modern infrastructure and workforce skills. A new round of severe public service cuts and pay freezes will keep the UK in the slow lane,\u201d said O\u2019Grady. The latest figures suggested the UK still had a long way to go to shake off the effects of the financial crisis. Statisticians said that output per hour was lower in all G7 countries in 2014 than would have been the case if pre-downturn trends had continued since 2007. The UK\u2019s productivity gap of about 18% compared with a gap of about 7% for the rest of the G7. Policymakers have been debating Britain\u2019s \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d as they seek to assess whether the losses during and after the downturn will prove to be permanent. If productivity growth does not recover to its pre-crisis trend that has implications for inflation. If firms cannot raise output per hour they may well raise prices instead to maintain their profit margins. That in turn will influence the Bank of England\u2019s decision over when to start raising interest rates from their current record low of 0.5%, said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. \u201cHow productivity develops going forward will be a critical factor in how soon and how far the Bank of England raises interest rates. If productivity has taken a significant lasting hit, it means that the economy has less potential to grow without generating inflationary pressures and that interest rates will need to rise at an earlier stage,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government looks set to clash with Chinese ministers next week after promising to raise the sensitive issue of steel \u201cdumping\u201d following a new threat to 3,000 jobs in the north east of England. George Osborne leads a delegation to Beijing which includes the business minister, Anna Soubry, who said on Friday that she would raise the issues that are threatening the survival of the Redcar steel works. \u201cWe help with energy costs and recently voted to protect our steel industry from Chinese dumping. Next week I am in China and I will talk to Chinese officials,\u201d said Soubry. She was speaking after SSI, the owner of the plant on Teesside said it was going to halt production and mothball some operations amid mounting financial losses. The company blamed a deteriorating steel market for the suspension of output at the 160-year-old site. It said it hoped to resume production eventually. The Thai-owned SSI is struggling to pay outstanding debts, leading to speculation about how long it could keep going while employing 2,000 staff and 1,000 contractors. Any closure would be a heavy blow because levels of unemployment are among the highest in Britain. \u201cWe are taking this pause in production in order to re-evaluate and assess the situation following the outcome of ongoing discussions with our various stakeholders, including government and suppliers,\u201d said Cornelius Louwrens, SSI\u2019s UK business director. \u201cIt is with great regret that we have had to make this announcement and we are deeply aware of the concern it will give to our employees and their families.\u201d SSI bought Redcar from Tata Steel, which had mothballed the plant. Last month, Tata announced plans to lay off up to 250 workers at Llanwern in Wales. In July, the India-based group said it might need to shed 720 jobs, mainly at Rotherham in Yorkshire, amid high UK energy prices and mounting competition, particularly from low cost products made in China. SSI said the price for \u201cslab\u201d steel \u2013 usually further processed to use in pipes and tubes \u2013 had plummeted from $500 a tonne to below $300 over the past year. \u201cThe problems within the global steel industry have been well publicised in recent weeks and our decision follows a major deterioration in steel prices affecting our business during the course of this year,\u201d it said.

The company, chaired by the former CBI president Sir Mike Rake, ended weeks of speculation by opting for an IPO over a bid from its French rival Ingenico. Its private equity owners, Advent and Bain Capital, put the planned flotation on hold last week as Ingenico showed signs that it might increase its \u00a36.6bn bid. The IPO plan went back on track on Wednesday as its owners grew more concerned about the risks attached to Ingenico\u2019s bid, which would have doubled the French company\u2019s market capitalisation and needed shareholder approval. The flotation will raise about \u00a3890m that Worldpay will use to reduce its debt. Advent, Bain and Worldpay\u2019s management will cash in parts of their stakes and British employees will receive between \u00a31,000 and \u00a36,000 each from the sale, which will leave at least 25% of the shares publicly traded. Worldpay processes 11.5bn payments a year online, in store and over the phone for 400,000 merchants ranging from hairdressers and restaurants to airlines and big retailers such as Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer. Its flotation is set to be the biggest in the UK since Glencore\u2019s \u00a336bn flotation in 2011.

      "bodyText": "The transformation of one of Britain\u2019s biggest and most unloved stations, Birmingham New Street, into a welcoming space of light and life has been completed, with hopes that the five-year works worth \u00a3750m will help change the face of the city. The old, dark concourse of New Street has been replaced with a giant, glass-roofed atrium, flooding the station with natural light. The station opens to the public on Sunday and an adjoining redeveloped shopping centre, Grand Central, will open on Thursday. The station has been rebuilt while continuing to serve 170,000 passengers who use the station each day, in the 1960s concrete building designed for barely a third of that number. Network Rail now hopes that the station will become a retail destination in its own right, helping to revive the local area in the way that St Pancras has in London, with 43 shops in New Street as well as Grand Central and a 250,000 sq ft John Lewis store built alongside. Mark Carne, chief executive of Network Rail, said: \u201cBirmingham New Street sits right at the heart of our rail network and the transformation which has taken place here is nothing short of stunning. The station is now bigger, brighter and better able to meet the needs of the growing number of people who use it each day. \u201cRebuilding one of the busiest stations in the country without impacting on passengers\u2019 journeys has been a major challenge, but I\u2019m extremely proud to say that Network Rail and our partners on this project have done just that.\u201d Up to 3,500 workers were employed at a time on the rebuilding, which involved tens of thousands of tonnes of concrete being removed and recycled to create space for the new station, whose atrium covers a concourse five times the size of London Euston\u2019s. Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, said: \u201cThe improvements made at this important transport hub have made it into a truly impressive building that passengers and the people of Birmingham can use and enjoy.\u201d Sir Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham city council, said: \u201cThe station redevelopment has been a key project for the city, stimulating economic growth and regeneration and, with the added creation of Grand Central; it has provided one of the best-connected retail spaces in the country. This is sure to have a catalytic effect on further regeneration of the city centre and attracting businesses to Birmingham.\u201d Birmingham New Street is the busiest station outside London and the busiest interchange station in the UK, with a train leaving the station every 37 seconds. The addition of 15 public lifts will make the station fully accessible for the first time.",

    "webTitle": "UK interest rates may have to be cut, warns Bank of England chief economist", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Interest rates in the UK may have to be cut further from their record low level, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has warned, as he highlighted signs that the global financial crisis is entering a third phase of turmoil. Andy Haldane cited evidence of a slowdown on the domestic front and risks to the global economy from China, where an economic downturn has coincided with a stock market rout that has sent shockwaves through the world\u2019s markets. His view that the Bank may need to resort to even more unconventional moves to protect the UK recovery puts Haldane at odds with the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, who has indicated that rates may rise from 0.5% early next year. The suggestion that rates should stay low for longer will be welcomed by homeowners with tracker mortgages but is a blow to savers who have been hoping to finally see higher returns on their money. The warning from a top Bank official over the UK\u2019s fragility is also unwelcome news for George Osborne as he seeks to emphasise his stewardship of the economy following Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader. Haldane, one of nine policymakers who set interest rates, was speaking a day after the US central bank decided to delay an interest rate hike for the world\u2019s biggest economy. The US rate-setters blamed a more fragile global outlook in remarks that further rattled jittery financial markets. The FTSE 100 fell more than 1% in the wake of the US decision. In a wide-ranging speech that called on central bankers to think more radically to fend off the next downturn \u2013 including the notion of abolishing cash \u2013 Haldane warned the UK was not ready for higher borrowing costs. \u201cIn my view, the balance of risks to UK growth, and to UK inflation at the two-year horizon, is skewed squarely and significantly to the downside,\u201d he said. \u201cAgainst that backdrop, the case for raising UK rates in the current environment is, for me, some way from being made.\u201d Given the range of risks facing the economy, there is every chance the next rate move could be a cut instead of an increase. \u201cWere the downside risks I have discussed to materialise, there could be a need to loosen rather than tighten the monetary reins as a next step to support UK growth and return inflation to target,\u201d Haldane said in a speech entitled \u201cHow low can you go?\u201d Haldane\u2019s view contrasts with comments from other members of the monetary policy committee, who have been talking up the strength of the UK economy and its ability to withstand shockwaves from slowing emerging markets. He argued that the latest developments in China and Greece should be seen as part of a pattern. \u201cIn my view, these should not been seen as independent events, as lightning bolts from the blue. Rather, they are part of a connected sequence of financial disturbances that have hit the global economic and financial system over the past decade,\u201d he said. \u201cRecent events form the latest leg of what might be called a three-part crisis trilogy. Part one of that trilogy was the \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 crisis of 2008-09. Part two was the \u2018euro-area\u2019 crisis of 2011-12. And we may now be entering the early stages of part three of the trilogy, the \u2018emerging market\u2019 crisis of 2015 onwards.\u201d Added to that, Haldane highlighted challenges in Britain. \u201cWhile the UK\u2019s recovery remains on track, there are straws in the wind to suggest slowing growth into the second half of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployment is softening, with a fall in employment in the second quarter and surveys suggesting slowing growth rates. \u201cSurveys of output growth, in manufacturing, construction and possibly services, have also recently weakened. All of these data were taken prior to recent emerging-market economy wobbles.\u201d The suggestion of cutting rates closer to zero, or even moving to negative interest rates for the first time in the Bank\u2019s history, adds fuel to the debate over where monetary policy goes next after more than six years of record low borrowing costs. Haldane said central banks may have to get used to interest rates being permanently low. He appeared to dismiss the idea of making quantitative easing permanent. But one option Haldane said central banks should explore was the use of state-issued digital currencies, similar to the bitcoin virtual currency. \u201cPerhaps central bank money is ripe for its own great technological leap forward,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets fell sharply on both sides of the Atlantic on Friday after the US Federal Reserve backed away from raising interest rates, and blamed the weaker global economic outlook. The German and French indices both shed over 3%, while the FTSE 100 fell by 105 points or 1.7% by mid afternoon. Wall Street then joined the sell-off, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping by 1.5% or 255 points to 16,418 at the open. Investors were disconcerted by unexpectedly dovish comments by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Thursday night. \u201cThe Federal Reserve surprised market participants by combining a decision to leave interest rates unchanged with a dovish commentary and outlook,\u201d explained Guy Dunham of Baring Asset Management. \u201cPrior to the Fed decision, markets were looking positive but they now find themselves under pressure with global growth concerns weighing on sentiment,\u201d FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga added. European stocks suffered as the euro strengthened one cent against the US dollar to $1.143, a move that would hurt eurozone manufacturers. \u201cThe longer investors had to ruminate on Thursday\u2019s Fed statement the worse they seemed to take it, with the European indices widening their losses as the day went on,\u201d said Conner Campbell of SpreadEX. \u201cAn export-hurting rise in the euro-dollar was the main culprit.\u201d The sell-off came after the Federal Open Market Committee voted to leave borrowing costs at their current record low of zero to 0.25%. At a later press conference, Yellen cited volatility triggered by the slowing Chinese economy as a reason for caution. \u201cThe outlook abroad appears to have become less certain,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cIn the light of the heightened uncertainty abroad ... the committee judged it appropriate to wait.\u201d That helped to drive the US dollar down by 0.2% against major currencies. In Japan, the Nikkei index fell 2% as the yen strengthened against the dollar. Money also flowed into German government debt, a classic safe haven, driving down the yield on bunds. Some economists had predicted that Thursday\u2019s FOMC meeting would deliver the first rate hike in almost a decade, given recent improvements in the US labour market. But after Yellen\u2019s unexpectedly dovish performance, the Fed is unlikely to raise rates at its next meeting in October. And there\u2019s now roughly a 50% chance that the first hike comes in 2016, according to M&amp;G\u2019s Bond Vigilantes. Risk aversion pushed the gold price up, meaning shares in gold producers bucked the trend on Friday. Market reaction to the Fed\u2019s decision was split. Marc Ostwald, of ADM Investor Services, accused Yellen of \u201c injecting further unwanted uncertainty\u201d into the markets. If the FOMC\u2019s objective was to convey confusion, it has succeeded, thereby ploughing a deep furrow of instability and destabilisation, and shining a very bright light on the large debt and liquidity trap it and other G7 central banks have spent seven years crafting. But Anne Richards, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management, believes the Fed made the right call. \u201cRight now, there is not a compelling reason to raise interest rates in the US,\u201d she told Bloomberg TV. There is a risk that by hiking too soon, the Fed \u201ccould make 2016 much uglier from an economic perspective\u201d, Richards added.",

This has prompted analyst Alex DeGroote at Peel Hunt to repeat buy recommendations on the main terrestrial broadcasters. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ITV has exclusive rights to the Rugby World Cup, which starts today. This is important for an improved share of viewing for the ITV family in the second half of 2015. It is also important for third and fourth quarter advert performance across the ITV network.</p> <p>A good showing by the home nations could drive a healthy \u2018late spot\u2019 market. Overall, we remain very positive on the outlook for free to air broadcasters in the UK (earnings per share momentum; regulation; consolidation; retransmission fees). </p> </blockquote> <p>He adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Live sport is increasingly \u2018appointment viewing\u2019, particularly when the top games are on at domestic peak time. Unusually, in this day and age, the Rugby World Cup is also on free to air terrestrial TV. One of ITV plc\u2019s main issues has been a decline in SOV (share of viewing) year to date, and this could be remedied in part with good audiences through the World Cup.</p> <p>Rugby appeals to a key demographic (affluent male, etc). Hence we would expect all the big brewers, gaming companies and autos to be visible in coming weeks. A healthy spot market should also ensue if England, in particular, makes it to the latter stages.</p> </blockquote> <p>For the broadcasting sector, one issue will be the fate of UTV Media, 172.25p, which trying to sell its television interests, with ITV said to be the leading contender to buy them. UTV also owns TalkSport as well as the ITV franchise in Northern Ireland and a new channel, UTV Ireland, which has made an unsuccessful start to life in terms of audience numbers and advertising.

      "bodyText": "With estimates that the Rugby World Cup could add nearly \u00a31bn to UK GDP (courtesy Ernst &amp; Young) one of the business beneficiaries should be ITV. For a change a major sporting event is live on a free to air broadcaster rather than available only to satellite or cable viewers. This has prompted analyst Alex DeGroote at Peel Hunt to repeat buy recommendations on the main terrestrial broadcasters. He said: ITV has exclusive rights to the Rugby World Cup, which starts today. This is important for an improved share of viewing for the ITV family in the second half of 2015. It is also important for third and fourth quarter advert performance across the ITV network. A good showing by the home nations could drive a healthy \u2018late spot\u2019 market. Overall, we remain very positive on the outlook for free to air broadcasters in the UK (earnings per share momentum; regulation; consolidation; retransmission fees). He adds: Live sport is increasingly \u2018appointment viewing\u2019, particularly when the top games are on at domestic peak time. Unusually, in this day and age, the Rugby World Cup is also on free to air terrestrial TV. One of ITV plc\u2019s main issues has been a decline in SOV (share of viewing) year to date, and this could be remedied in part with good audiences through the World Cup. Rugby appeals to a key demographic (affluent male, etc). Hence we would expect all the big brewers, gaming companies and autos to be visible in coming weeks. A healthy spot market should also ensue if England, in particular, makes it to the latter stages. For the broadcasting sector, one issue will be the fate of UTV Media, 172.25p, which trying to sell its television interests, with ITV said to be the leading contender to buy them. UTV also owns TalkSport as well as the ITV franchise in Northern Ireland and a new channel, UTV Ireland, which has made an unsuccessful start to life in terms of audience numbers and advertising. De Groote said: ITV is in effect a \u2018white knight\u2019 rescuing UTV Media after the calamitous downgrades from UTV Ireland, the new commercial channel. We downgrade our UTV target price to 195p (from 250p) in line with our break-up thesis, which (unfortunately) ascribes zero value to the new channel. ITV is currently flat at 246.7p in a falling market while Scottish broadcaster STV, which could also ultimately be in ITV\u2019s sights, is down 6.75p at 442.5p.",

      "bodyText": "The head of coal within BHP Billiton says anti-coal activists are winning over public opinion, making it arguably the industry\u2019s biggest problem. Mike Henry, the president of the company\u2019s coal division, said Australians would continue to be swayed by the \u201cno coal camp\u201d who had outperformed big business with \u201csimple messages\u201d and an active media profile. Public discussion of the future of the energy sector was dominated by \u201ctwo extremes\u201d in coal industry opponents and their polar opposites, climate change deniers, Henry said. Edelman, the world\u2019s biggest public relations firm, in the US this week that it would no longer work with coal producers or climate change deniers as they were too great a reputation risk. In a speech to an American Chamber of Commerce in Australia function in Brisbane, he said the positions of both climate change deniers and those who wanted to shut down the industry \u201cinvolve blind faith and neither is grounded in good science\u201d. Henry suggested the effectiveness of coal opponents in \u201cthe court of public opinion\u201d had led to a schism in public perception of the future of the energy market and its reality on the most credible forecasts. An Australian survey for the industry found a \u201cwidespread public view that coal use will be phased out over the next 10 to 20 years in favour of renewables\u201d. However, Henry said BHP was not alone in its forecast that the most likely scenario \u2013 even with a significant shift to renewables and a price on carbon emissions to tackle climate change \u2013 was for world demand for thermal coal for power stations to at most decline slightly by 2030. This was because of the relative cheapness of coal and the pace of energy demand growth in Asia, he said. The demand for metallurgical coal to make steel, including for renewable energy technologies, would continue to grow \u2013 which he said was a boon to the economy of Queensland, the world\u2019s largest source of it. Henry later told Guardian Australia that Edelman\u2019s renunciation of the industry was \u201cpossibly\u201d a sign of the shift in public perception. But he said the firm had been \u201cpretty hard markers\u201d as Toyota, the world\u2019s biggest seller of hybrid vehicles, had \u201cinterestingly\u201d been ranked the same as BHP. Henry said that mining companies needed to better engage in \u201cthe balanced, big debates that need to occur around these things\u201d but denied it was \u201cindustry promotion\u201d. \u201cI believe what genuinely smart people globally are saying. What they\u2019re saying is fossil fuels are going to be here for a long time to come under a range of different scenarios,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you believe that and you accept the science around climate change and that the world needs to address it, we need to be as aligned and effective as we can be in mobilising effort to address emissions and to play our part in global emissions reduction.\u201d Henry said the company had managed to reduce carbon emissions from its own operations by 15% or more since 2007 despite \u201cvery significant growth\u201d. But this did not include the emissions from the burning of its coal. Henry could not immediately say whether they had grown overall in volume despite the fact less carbon was now emitted per unit of energy or steel produced. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is exactly for the BHP Billiton portfolio,\u201d he said. Henry said BHP were \u201cbig supporters\u201d of a carbon price but that this was not a single \u201csilver bullet\u201d for the transformation of the economy. Asked about the prospects of Adani\u2019s highly controversial Carmichael mine proposal in Queensland, Henry said it was a \u201cpretty good indication\u201d of growing coal demand in India. \u201c[But] I don\u2019t want to comment specifically on the project,\u201d he said. Asked if the Galilee basin \u2013 the inland region where Adani\u2019s is one of more than half a dozen proposed mines \u2013 was a compelling business case on the future of Asian demand, Henry was likewise non-committal. \u201cI think the business case is compelling for ongoing investment in coal longer term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect to see demand for coal supported for decades to come. As to whether those specific investments make sense or not, I just don\u2019t know. Each company will look at investments in their own way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Poundland has received final clearance for the \u00a355m takeover of its single-price rival 99p Stores after the competition regulator withdrew early objections that the deal could be bad for consumers. The ruling by the Competition and Markets Authority gives Poundland the all-clear to complete the takeover more than six months after it was announced. The CMA surprised many in the retail sector in April when it said the deal could reduce competition in more than 90 locations, suggesting Poundland would have to scrap stores in those places. Both retailers sell similar ranges of consumer goods, stationery, food, drink and homeware. But the CMA changed its mind in August after conducting a survey of 5,000 customers and examining the companies\u2019 internal data. It accepted that low-price retailing had taken hold in the UK and that the combined company would meet competition from Poundworld, Wilko, B&amp;M and other value chains, as well as Tesco and Asda among the supermarkets. Announcing its final decision, the CMA said: \u201cAlong with Poundworld, the companies are each other\u2019s closest competitors but after the merger they will still face competition. The CMA has concluded that the merger may not be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition. Consequently, customers would not face a reduction in choice, value or quality of service as a result of the merger.\u201d The ruling is a victory for Poundland, which was undeterred by the lengthy and costly inquiry and whose arguments the CMA accepted. Poundland told the CMA that the rise of low-price retailing, the expansion plans of its rivals, and supermarkets introducing their own \u00a31 offers meant it would have strong competition. Jim McCarthy, the chief executive of Poundland, said: \u201cWe welcome the CMA\u2019s decision to clear the merger. We believe that the acquisition of 99p Stores will be great for both customers and shareholders and we will now move to completion by the end of the month.\u201d The recession and years of falling real wages after the financial crisis turned British shoppers into bargain hunters and fuelled the rise of single-price retailers, low-price grocers Aldi and Lidl and other chains offering everyday deals. The embattled supermarkets have been forced to respond by cutting prices and closing stores. McCarthy said Poundland would set out its plans for 99p Stores with its half-year results in November. He has already said 99p Stores will be rebranded as Poundland, resulting in a 1p per item price rise for regular shoppers at the acquired company. The acquisition, announced in February, will add 250 extra shops to Poundland\u2019s estate of about 600 British outlets, accelerating progress towards a target of 1,000 stores in the UK. The company, which topped sales of \u00a31bn this year, also has more than 40 Irish stores and nine in Spain under the Dealz brand.",
