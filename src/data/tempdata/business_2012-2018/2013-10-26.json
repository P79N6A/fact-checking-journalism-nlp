    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Five questions that the big six energy firms must answer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The bosses of the big six energy companies will appear before the energy and climate change select committee on 29 October. The powerful group of MPs, chaired by Tim Yeo, will grill them on green levies, profit levels \u2013 and why consumers face such big increases in their bills. These are the questions they should ask: Why have you increased household energy prices by up to 10% when inflation is almost a quarter of this? The companies will argue that their costs have risen hugely because of wholesale power price increases and \"green\" levies. Don't take this at face value: companies buy a portfolio of future contracts lasting many years to ensure that their wholesale supplies will meet future retail demand. If they have underestimated their needs, that is their responsibility \u2013 and they could choose to absorb that cost. No one knows how much the power companies have bought in advance \u2013 and at what price \u2013 so independent experts have to take their arguments on trust. Green levies make up only 9% of the overall bill currently, a figure that will rise to 14% by 2020. How can you say the retail energy market is competitive when more than 95% of households use of one of the big six firms? The companies always argue that they are constrained from profiteering because consumers are free to switch to one of their competitors if they don't like price rises. But the dominance of the big six makes it very hard for small independents to enter the market. A consumer who consults one of the switching services will invariably be offered a change to another of the big six. Why is it that 30 years since the market began to be liberalised, a group of enormous firms still have a stranglehold over the sector? And why do they all put their prices up pretty much at exactly the same time, if they are not acting in concert in some way? Why shouldn't the big six have their control of the wholesale power market broken up and separated, as Ed Miliband is arguing? Companies such as Scottish Power will argue that currently they are making losses in both retail supply and wholesale power generation. But that is unusual. When companies are making massive profits in power generation they always say it is illegal for them to cross-subsidise their retail side, but the fact is they can choose where to take losses. It is also worth remembering that Centrica, the owner of British Gas, spent \u00a3500m buying back its own shares earlier this year to boost shareholder returns. The big six claim the 5% margin they earn in retail is very low. However, this figure is in line with the big supermarkets. In Northern Ireland, where prices are capped, suppliers make just 2% profit. Small retailers say it is hard to build market share \u2013 partly, they say, because the big six have the wholesale power market sewn up. Miliband is right to pledge an end to \"vertical integration\". How much money do your trading arms make each year, and why do you not openly report those numbers to Ofgem and the public? The big six will tell you that all their accounts are open to Ofgem scrutiny already, so they have nothing to lose from an open competitive review of the kind demanded by David Cameron. But they do not reveal their trading profits. In fact, the companies are reluctant to reveal even how many staff they employ in these operations \u2013 whose job is basically to speculate on market movements. Anecdotal evidence suggests this is a huge money-spinner. The MPs should push them to reveal everything about such departments, including whether they have given details to ongoing probes into gas trading irregularities. Why have many of the big six been involved in mis-selling, overcharging or other abuses, and do you think \u2013 like the banks \u2013 that you are too big to fail? There's probably no answer to the first of these, except \"sorry\". Days ago, the last of the big six, Scottish Power, paid an \u00a38.5m fine after Ofgem found inadequate training and monitoring of staff had led to inaccurate information on annual charges, consumption calculations and tariffs being given out. E.ON, which was fined \u00a31.7m in 2012 for overcharging, had to pay an additional \u00a32.5m this summer to help its poorest customers meet their fuel bills this winter after it was found to be selling low-energy light bulbs it should have given away. SSE was fined \u00a310.5m for \"prolonged and extensive\" mis-selling, while British Gas was fined \u00a31m two years ago for misreporting how much energy it had supplied. Too big to fail? Energy companies seem to be claiming, like the banks, that we need them more than they need us. They repeatedly warn that if they are not allowed to make profits they won't invest. Yet they've clearly not invested enough in the past, while their dominance in the market may have deterred other potential investors.",

      "body": "<p>The bosses of the big six energy companies will appear before the energy and climate change select committee on 29 October. The powerful group of MPs, chaired by Tim Yeo, will grill them on green levies, profit levels \u2013 and why consumers face such big increases in their bills. These are the questions they should ask:</p> <h2><strong>Why have you increased household energy prices by up to 10% when inflation is almost a quarter of this?</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The companies will argue that their costs have risen hugely because of wholesale power price increases and \"green\" levies. Don't take this at face value: companies buy a portfolio of future contracts lasting many years to ensure that their wholesale supplies will meet future retail demand. If they have underestimated their needs, that is their responsibility \u2013 and they could choose to absorb that cost. No one knows how much the power companies have bought in advance \u2013 and at what price \u2013 so independent experts have to take their arguments on trust. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/oct/10/green-taxes-energy-bill-fuel-sse-price-rising\" title=\"\">Green levies make up only 9% of the overall bill currently, a figure that will rise to 14% by 2020</a>.</p> <h2><strong>How can you say the retail energy market is competitive when more than 95% of households use of one of the big six firms?</strong></h2> <p>The companies always argue that they are constrained from profiteering because consumers are free to switch to one of their competitors if they don't like price rises. But the dominance of the big six makes it very hard for small independents to enter the market. A consumer who consults one of the switching services will invariably be offered a change to another of the big six. Why is it that 30 years since the market began to be liberalised, a group of enormous firms still have a stranglehold over the sector? And why do they all put their prices up pretty much at exactly the same time, if they are not acting in concert in some way?</p> <h2><strong>Why shouldn't the big six have their control of the wholesale power market broken up and separated, as Ed Miliband is arguing?</strong></h2> <p>Companies such as Scottish Power will argue that currently they are making losses in both retail supply and wholesale power generation. But that is unusual. When companies are making massive profits in power generation they always say it is illegal for them to cross-subsidise their retail side, but the fact is they can choose where to take losses. It is also worth remembering that Centrica, the owner of British Gas, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/27/centrica-british-gas-increase-profit\" title=\"\">spent \u00a3500m buying back its own shares earlier this year</a> to boost shareholder returns.</p> <p>The big six claim the 5% margin they earn in retail is very low. However, this figure is in line with the big supermarkets. In Northern Ireland, where prices are capped, suppliers make just 2% profit.</p> <p>Small retailers say it is hard to build market share \u2013 partly, they say, because the big six have the wholesale power market sewn up. Miliband is right to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/26/energy-bill-freeze-consumer-groups-welcome\" title=\"\">pledge an end to \"vertical integration\"</a>.</p> <h2><strong>How much money do your trading arms make each year, and why do you not openly report those numbers to Ofgem and the public?</strong></h2> <p>The big six will tell you that all their accounts are open to Ofgem scrutiny already, so they have nothing to lose from an open competitive review of the kind demanded by David Cameron. But they do not reveal their trading profits. In fact, the companies are reluctant to reveal even how many staff they employ in these operations \u2013 whose job is basically to speculate on market movements. Anecdotal evidence suggests this is a huge money-spinner. The MPs should push them to reveal everything about such departments, including whether they have given details to ongoing probes into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/06/gas-price-fixing-investigation-citigroup\" title=\"\">gas trading irregularities</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Why have many of the big six been involved in mis-selling, overcharging or other abuses, and do you think \u2013 like the banks \u2013 that you are too big to fail?</strong></h2> <p>There's probably no answer to the first of these, except \"sorry\". Days ago, the last of the big six, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/22/scottish-power-pay-misleading-customers-ofgem\" title=\"\">Scottish Power, paid an \u00a38.5m fine</a> after Ofgem found inadequate training and monitoring of staff had led to inaccurate information on annual charges, consumption calculations and tariffs being given out. E.ON, which was fined \u00a31.7m in 2012 for overcharging, had to pay an additional \u00a32.5m this summer to help its poorest customers meet their fuel bills this winter after it was found to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jul/09/eon-fined-energy-saving-lightbulbs\" title=\"\">selling low-energy light bulbs it should have given away</a>. SSE was fined \u00a310.5m for \"prolonged and extensive\" mis-selling, while British Gas was fined \u00a31m two years ago for misreporting how much energy it had supplied.</p> <p>Too big to fail? Energy companies seem to be claiming, like the banks, that we need them more than they need us. They repeatedly warn that if they are not allowed to make profits they won't invest. Yet they've clearly not invested enough in the past, while their dominance in the market may have deterred other potential investors.</p>",

Last week, when it fell into the hands of hedge funds, they muttered that its status as a public limited company \u2013 albeit one wholly owned by the Co-op \u2013 meant it was a strange hybrid, instead of a \"true\" mutual, so its near-collapse held few wider lessons for the sector.

It's undeniably true that, as the parliamentary commission on banking standards catalogued so damningly earlier this year, the banking plcs that appeared to be the future when a wave of demutualisations swept through the financial sector in the 1990s have not served society, the taxpayer, or Britain's businesses well. What's also clear is that other countries have a far more varied system of banking institutions, whether it's the many thousands of thriving credit unions in the US, of which about 44% of Americans are members, or the network of Sparkasse savings banks across Germany, where more than two-thirds of banks are local, instead of national. The coalition has made some moves towards nurturing diversity, including loosening regulations on setting up new banks, and providing taxpayer funding to help credit unions expand; while campaigns such as Move Your Money have helped to highlight the availability of smaller alternatives to the faceless high-street giants. An increasingly vibrant undergrowth of alternatives to banks, such as crowdfunders and peer-to-peer lenders, has also begun to thrive.

      "bodyText": "Viewed through western eyes, the idea of striking oil conjures up cinematic images of geysers of crude gushing skywards and untold riches lining the pockets of lucky prospectors. Even in the world's richest countries, though, a deep reservoir of natural resources can crowd out other industries and distort politics. And in Africa, where the stakes are higher, it's become well known that striking oil \u2013 or iron ore, or diamonds \u2013 can be a curse rather than a blessing. Kickbacks to kleptocratic politicians, disenfranchised local people, tax-dodging multinationals' proceeds leaching abroad \u2013 it's a familiar story. Research by development economist Paul Collier in his book The Bottom Billion suggests resource-rich developing countries can also be more prone to violent conflict as desperately poor communities take up arms to fight for their share of the spoils. For the first time in decades, though, there is some reason to hope that a better model is emerging that may be more successful in bringing the benefits of Africa's extraordinary endowments to the people who need them most. And it comes at a critical time, when countries such as Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda and Tanzania are starting to exploit recently discovered reserves of oil and minerals. David Cameron used Britain's chairmanship of the G8 this year to press for action on trade, tax and transparency. Campaigners complain that the details of some of the pledges made at Cameron's G8 Lough Erne summit are yet to be implemented \u2013 a key announcement is still awaited on how robust the UK's version of a mooted registry of who owns offshore companies will be, for example. But with the UK in the process of implementing the European accounting directive, which should force natural resources firms listed in London to report how much they are paying in taxes and royalties on a project-by-project basis, there are reasons to hope that at least the debate is moving in the right direction. In the US there will be similar requirements. Furthermore, a small but growing number of African countries are starting to try a different way of doing business with the drilling firms that come knocking \u2013 and a more considered way of spending the proceeds. Norway, with its \u00a3500bn sovereign wealth fund, is often seen as the epitome of a country that has managed its oil money well. But at an event organised by Oxfam and Oxford University last week to examine resource extraction in Africa, Tony Venables, of the university's centre for the analysis of resource-rich economies, stressed that the priorities of developing countries' governments should be different. They needed to focus on spending money at home, building up domestic infrastructure such as roads and power networks \u2013 which in turn would help to complement more private-sector investment \u2013 instead of squirrelling away the revenues overseas. Ghana, whose high commissioner was at Thursday's day-long seminar, provides one example of a country trying to do just that. Under a recent law, a fixed 70% of revenues are earmarked for current spending; 21% is put in a stabilisation fund to help the country cope with the sharp swings in prices that characterise most commodity markets; and the remaining 9% is set aside to be invested for the future, in a \"heritage fund\". Perhaps more importantly, the details of all new exploration and extraction contracts are published, so that pressure groups and the public can see the terms on which natural resources are being bought and sold. Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, an academic who has spent more than 15 years studying the impact of natural resource extraction in Africa, argued that some of the countries that had only recently discovered reserves of oil or minerals perhaps had a better chance of reaping the benefits than those with a long and tangled history of oil politics. He pointed out that British-backed oil companies had prospected in Nigeria before it even existed as a state in its modern form. \"The political economy of resource extraction is very entrenched in some of these countries,\" he said. He believed the new EU and US laws had more chance of success than voluntary initiatives. Of course, not everyone is optimistic: Dereje Alemayehu, chair of the Global Alliance for Tax Justice, argued that there were still far too many opportunities for corrupt officials to shield their money offshore in tax havens. And Venables pointed out that if the proceeds of resource extraction were to be effectively spent to the benefit of the public, that would require an effective state \u2013 not least a strong treasury and clued-in tax collectors. Finally, the commodities \"supercycle\", as it has been called, won't last for ever: prices have already weakened on world markets in some areas as investors come to terms with the fact that demand from China will not rise at the rampant pace of recent years indefinitely. In fact, perhaps the most important insight from Thursday's thinkfest was that the countries that will be proven most successful in managing their natural resources wealth may be those that use the dividends to help them develop their productive capacity in other sectors, and build diversified economies that will still be creating jobs and exports long after the wells have run dry.",

They had a goal: hard-working and aspirational, they wanted to find a way to help working people help themselves.

      "bodyText": "In an austere basement of a wool warehouse in Lancashire, 28 men huddled together. They had a goal: hard-working and aspirational, they wanted to find a way to help working people help themselves. They each put a week and half's wages \u2013 \u00a31 \u2013 into a pot and formed a new group: the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers. It was 1844. Visitors to Rochdale are still reminded of the heritage of those pioneers, who used their \u00a328 to set up a co-operative shop and invest the profits in community-owned housing. The houses still stand in the market town today and the railway bridge, in bold white letters, declares: \"Rochdale \u2013 birthplace of co\u2011operation\".

      "bodyText": "They are promised an exciting career and the chance to see \"the world's top sights\", but some who pay the best part of \u00a32,000 for training courses to join a company that supplies Ryanair with cabin crew end up disappointed. Those who are rejected during their probationary period are still pursued for training costs, while others with jobs are left angry by the working conditions dictated by their contract. Now several have raised their concerns with third parties who have discussed their situation with the Observer. The trainees are too frightened to speak directly to newspapers for fear that they may be pursued by lawyers for breaching their contracts, which they believe forbid them from talking to the media. But their decision to break their silence will focus further attention on Ryanair after its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, promised to reform its \"abrupt culture\" and rein in its \"macho\" image. Many Ryanair cabin crew are supplied by an Irish firm, Crewlink, which takes them on only after they have successfully completed a six-week training course. Crewlink runs its own course, but it also accepts recruits from a training school run by St James Management Services, based in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Those on the St James course pay \u00a31,650 upfront, or \u00a31,800 in instalments. Once the recruit starts working for Ryanair, Crewlink, their employer, deducts \u00a3150 a month from their salary to cover the cost of the course if they chose to pay in instalments. But it has been claimed that many who go on the course are rejected during a probationary period, leaving them with a hefty training bill. A Crewlink spokesman said: \"The overwhelming majority, over 95%, remain in our employment after six months.\" Emails seen by the Observer reveal that St James routinely tells trainees it will instruct a debt-collecting agency to pursue those with outstanding fees. According to the agreement, \"successful participants must achieve an 85% or 90% pass rate in all their examinations throughout the course\". Crewlink's contract, seen by the Observer, is clear there is no guarantee of a Ryanair job. Those taken on by Crewlink are paid \u00a313.39 an hour in-flight pay, according to the contract that explains that staff can transferred from one Ryanair base to another \"without compensation\". In one contract seen by the Observer, the probationary period lasts for 12 months. The contract also explains that cabin crew are required to work a number of standby days each month whereby they must be available within one hour of being called. Crewlink's contract makes clear that there are no company provisions for sick pay and cabin crew must pay \u00a330 a month for their uniform for the first 12 months. \"The company can terminate your employment at any time by giving you the statutory period of notice,\" the contract dictates. It explains that \"there is no notice period for those who have worked up to four weeks\". O'Leary won plaudits last week when he took to Twitter to answer questions from Ryanair passengers, many of whom subjected him to personal abuse. But in a sign that the company is keen to change its image, he promised to listen more to customers. However, he has said little so far about whether he sees any need to change the culture for those who wear the Ryanair uniform. A Crewlink spokesman declined to comment on \"inaccurate claims\" about its contract. He added: \"If people don't like our terms and conditions, they are free to leave at any time.\" Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said it was concerned that many companies were asking their trainees to pay too much towards the cost of their training. \"Our advisers are increasingly seeing cases, in different sectors, where people are being charged for training, uniforms and travel with the promise of a job that never materialises,\" Guy said. A Ryanair spokesman said: \"Once cabin crew start working for Ryanair, we pay for all their recurrent training, which is exactly what other airlines do.\" Requests for a comment from St James went unanswered.",
