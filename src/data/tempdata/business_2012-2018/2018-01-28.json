      "bodyText": "Australia is heading down the road towards Trump\u2019s America, Wayne Swan has warned \u2013 but the former Labor treasurer says it is not too late to reverse course. Naming inequality as one of the biggest threats to Australia\u2019s way of life, Swan said Scott Morrison\u2019s latest push for further company tax cuts, which would see the headline tax rate cut from 30 to 25%, would only serve to widen the growing gap between the rich and poor. Morrison has pointed to the United States, as well as the United Kingdom, as examples where cuts to company tax rates, a continuation of trickle-down thinking, has improved a country\u2019s economic outlook. Swan too pointed to America as an example \u2013 of how it can all go wrong. \u201cInequality is the growing concentration of wealth at the top, which suppresses the income and wealth of the great bulk of people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as that gets worse, as inequality gets worse, as the income wealth concentration gets worse, it suppresses living standards. \u201cIt poisons society and it destabilises democracy. And we now have, around the world, a lot of evidence that as the concentration of wealth got worse, you see a polarisation in the politics, and the rise of the more extreme right. \u201cExhibit A in this whole process is the United States where over the last 30 years, the incomes of the middle class has not moved. \u201cThey have substantial cuts in living standards and increasing concentration of wealth at the top, so it has hollowed out their middle class and created a vast army of working poor. And that is a product of what you call trickle-down economics, which essentially is really about tax cuts for the wealthy and the large corporates, deregulation of the powerful, destruction of social safety nets and the suppression of wages.\u201d The Turnbull government has named achieving their suite of company tax cuts as one of their goals for 2018. Labor, already in election mode, is expected to make inequality and insecurity within the workforce part a foundation of its policy platform. Pushing back against the company tax cuts, Swan said, was paramount. \u201cThe claims he [Morrison] makes that corporate tax cuts will lead to a surge in investment, and therefore growth in jobs, is not matched by the historical reality in the United States at all,\u201d Swan told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt is a failed experiment there over 30 years and what we have seen around the world in the last 10 or 20 years, is when the profitability of a cut is increased, it doesn\u2019t go into long-term investment, it goes back to shareholders through share buy-backs and into the pockets of the chief executives for outrageous executive pay. \u201cAustralia is an example of an economy that didn\u2019t go down what you call the neoliberal road. We have done a far better job in our country over 30 or 40 years of preserving the middle class and protecting people on low and vulnerable incomes. That doesn\u2019t mean to say there is not inequality here \u2013 there is. \u201cBut I\u2019ll give you this figure: in the last 30 years middle incomes in Australia increased 50%. In the United States, they went backwards. But the problem we have here is that in recent years we have seen a widening of the gap [and] a lot more insecure work. But we are not seeing the revival of private investment that Morrison would claim his policies should be producing. \u201cNow Morrison is saying: \u2018Let\u2019s do more and more even extreme trickle-down stuff,\u2019 \u2013 you know, the definition of insanity is when you keep doing the things that you have done in the past that didn\u2019t work.\u201d Next month Labor will host a conference aimed at highlighting the growing global dissent created by inequality, and the wider implications of its impact. Leading progressives, including president and CEO of the Centre for American Progress, the largest progressive thinktank in the US, Neera Tanden, and former UK Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, will speak to offer the global experience, and potential solutions.",

      "bodyText": "Worrying times for the family of Beatrice Bellman, better known as Beattie, Maureen Lipman\u2019s carping character in those old British Telecom advertisements. Henpecked son Melvyn will now be approaching retirement (and, boy, did he earn it). Meanwhile, grandson Anthony, whom we last heard of when grandma was memorably making light of his woeful exam performance, should now be in the prime of his career after shrugging off the initial disappointment of only attaining passes in pottery (\u201cAnthony, people will always need plates\u201d) and sociology (\u201che gets an \u2018ology\u2019 and he says he\u2019s failed!\u201d). At least, that\u2019s how the Bellmans\u2019 future would have been envisaged back in the late 1980s, when the family hogged our television ad breaks. The problem is that the retirement plans of both Melvyn and Anthony are now in danger of needing a considerable rethink. This is the case for employees of a number of major firms across the country \u2013 but, fittingly, BT Group is among them. We will find out more about one business\u2019s latest tangle with its pensioners this week, when the telecoms firm gives the City an update. Hanging over the trading numbers, though, is an estimated \u00a314bn pension deficit. The company has been hatching plans for a while to solve all that, by wriggling out of old promises to staff on a defined benefit pension scheme \u2013 which pay out to employees based on (a) years of service and (b) career-average earnings and/or final salary. These are extremely nice pensions to have \u2013 far better than many of us can hope to retire with \u2013 but having persuaded people to join businesses on the back of these pledges, companies now argue that they are unaffordable. This is rather galling for the staff affected, for three main reasons: first, as any A-level business student will tell you, pensions are wages deferred and if employers don\u2019t deliver on the pay packets previously promised to staff, it\u2019s conceptually no different from cutting somebody\u2019s salary. Second, and specific to BT, during the 1990s the prophets running the pension scheme believed it to be so well-funded that the company stopped making contributions. And third, when an employer tries to renege on promises to pay a certain retirement income, staff might feel slightly less irritated if the executive directors also felt some pain. Strangely, however, they always seem to be on slightly different deals. Earlier this month, the high court rejected BT\u2019s latest proposal to change its defined benefit pension payouts, after the company tried to link increases to the consumer price index of inflation, rather than the retail price index, which tends to be higher. That effort was focused on employees who joined the scheme between 1 April 1986 and 31 March 2001 \u2013 so both Melvyn\u2019s and Anthony\u2019s generations. Which leaves the telecoms group and a chunk of its staff at an impasse \u2013 with pension managers across UK businesses often looking as clueless as Anthony as he turned over his exam papers. Still, the only ways out of this pickle seem to be for an \u201cology\u201d to take effect. Either we get better at predicting financial markets (astrology); we all start dropping dead more quickly (cardiology); or we breed like rabbits (gynaecology). There is also a fourth option, which a number of businesses will inevitably try: they could attempt to talk their staff into accepting that their financial situation is not as bad as it appears.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The founder of Sweden\u2019s Ikea furniture chain, Ingvar Kamprad, has died at the age of 91. The company said Kamprad, whom it described as \u201cone of the greatest entrepreneurs of the 20th century\u201d, had \u201cpeacefully passed away at his home\u201d on Saturday. Kamprad founded Ikea in the 1940s at the age of 17, and built it into one of the world\u2019s best-known retailers. The name was composed from his own initials and those of the places in the Swedish countryside where he grew up. Known for its functional, flatpack furniture \u2013 such as Billy shelves and Malm chests of drawers \u2013 that has to be assembled by customers, Ikea became the world\u2019s largest furniture chain, with 412 stores across 49 countries. Torbj\u00f6rn L\u00f6\u00f6f, chief executive and president of Inter Ikea Group, the furniture giant\u2019s parent company, said: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by Ingvar\u2019s passing. We will remember his dedication and commitment to always side with the many people. To never give up, always try to become better and lead by example.\u201d The Swedish prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, said Kamprad was \u201ca unique entrepreneur \u2026 who made interior decorating accessible for the many, not just a few\u201d. Kamprad had not been involved in running Ikea since 1988, but had been acting as an adviser. In 2013 he stepped down from the board of Inter Ikea, and his youngest son became chairman. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at the analysis firm GlobalData, said: \u201cFew people can claim to have genuinely revolutionised retail. Ingvar Kamprad did. When he founded it, Ikea was markedly different to anything that had existed in retail. Much of this difference was down to Ingvar\u2019s Swedish heritage and instincts. \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that his innovative approach changed not just the furniture sector, but the way people decorated and led their lives at home.\u201d Kamprad was estimated to have accumulated a fortune of 610bn Swedish kronor (\u00a354bn) by 2016, according to Swedish media reports, which would make him one of the world\u2019s richest people. But Per Heggenes, chief executive of the Ikea Foundation, said Kamprad had long ago passed on his stake in Ikea\u2019s stores and franchise to the INGKA Foundation and Inter Ikea Group. \u201cHis death has no impact on the foundation or the companies at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has no impact beyond the loss of him as a founder and an icon. It\u2019s a huge loss but if you look at the company structure, nothing will change. His personal wealth is very limited.\u201d Kamprad was married twice. In 1973 he moved to Denmark, before seeking to lower his tax bill by moving to Switzerland. He returned to live in Sweden in 2014. The billionaire had a reputation for penny pinching, which he claimed helped Ikea become one of the world\u2019s top brand names, and wore secondhand clothes bought at flea markets. \u201cIt\u2019s in the nature of Sm\u00e5land to be thrifty,\u201d he said in a documentary released in 2016, referring to Sweden\u2019s southern agricultural region where he was born. \u201cIf we want to be cost-conscious, we should do it, not just talk about how cost-conscious we are.\u201d The Ikea founder had faced questions over his past involvement with Nazi groups, which he admitted in a 1999 book about his life and described as his \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d, asking for forgiveness for his \u201cstupidity\u201d. He also admitted to Swedish media that he had attended meetings of Nazi organisations between 1945 and 1948. Kamprad grew up on a farm in southern Sweden. He turned into a budding entrepreneur aged five selling matches to his neighbours. As a teenager he graduated to selling seeds, pens and nylon stockings from his bicycle. He founded Ikea in 1943 and began selling affordable furniture five years later; the first mail-order catalogue came out in 1951. In 1955, the Ikea employee Gillis Lundgren had the idea of removing the legs from a table and tucking them under its top to create the firm\u2019s trademark flat-pack furniture, which was easier and cheaper to transport. Ikea\u2019s first store outside Sweden opened in Norway in 1963 and it began colonising Europe; the first US store opened in 1985. The initial success of Ikea\u2019s no-nonsense furniture was ascribed to the Swedes\u2019 obsession with functionalism. Lars Engman, Ikea\u2019s then design manager, said in 2003: \u201cSweden created the Volvo, Italy the Ferrari.\u201d The bright colours of the products were designed as an antidote to Sweden\u2019s long, dark winters. Jesper B\u00f6rjesson, a TV reporter who, like Kamprad, was born in \u00c4lmhult municipality and was the last to interview him, said Kamprad had continued to play a role in the company until last year, with executive training taking place at his house. \u201cHe lived upstairs and that was his flat, and then downstairs was where he took some of the meetings, and I think it was where he grew up, so it was very symbolic.\u201d B\u00f6rjesson said Kamprad had been pleased to return to \u00c4lmhult, where the first Ikea store was opened and where the firm\u2019s head offices are still based. \u201cHe was so happy to have moved home again, and he got to meet his old friends, and he could sit there in the countryside at his home and contemplate. \u201cI think everybody is sad today, but he\u2019s talked about his death for a long time. He\u2019s prepared himself and the company for this day.\u201d",

The name was composed from his own initials and those of the places in the Swedish countryside where he grew up.<br></p> <p>Known for its functional, flatpack furniture \u2013 such as Billy shelves and Malm chests of drawers \u2013 that has to be assembled by customers, Ikea became the world\u2019s largest furniture chain, with 412 stores across 49 countries.</p> <p>Torbj\u00f6rn L\u00f6\u00f6f, chief executive and president of Inter Ikea Group, the furniture giant\u2019s parent company, said: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by Ingvar\u2019s passing. We will remember his dedication and commitment to always side with the many people. To never give up, always try to become better and lead by example.\u201d</p> <p>The Swedish prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, said Kamprad was \u201ca unique entrepreneur \u2026 who made interior decorating accessible for the many, not just a few\u201d. <br></p> <p>Kamprad had not been involved in running Ikea since 1988, but had been acting as an adviser. In 2013 he stepped down from the board of Inter Ikea, and his youngest son became chairman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed573da0d7761e8afd165f53740465b2243b0ad6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed573da0d7761e8afd165f53740465b2243b0ad6/0_143_4188_2513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ingvar Kamprad, pictured in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ingvar Kamprad, pictured in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at the analysis firm GlobalData, said: \u201cFew people can claim to have genuinely revolutionised retail. Ingvar Kamprad did. When he founded it, Ikea was markedly different to anything that had existed in retail. Much of this difference was down to Ingvar\u2019s Swedish heritage and instincts. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that his innovative approach changed not just the furniture sector, but the way people decorated and led their lives at home.\u201d</p> <p>Kamprad was estimated to have accumulated a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/ikea-billionaire-ingvar-kamprad-buys-his-clothes-at-second-hand-stalls\">fortune of 610bn Swedish kronor (\u00a354bn)</a> by 2016, according to Swedish media reports, which would make him one of the world\u2019s richest people.</p> <p>But Per Heggenes, chief executive of the Ikea Foundation, said Kamprad had long ago passed on his stake in Ikea\u2019s stores and franchise to the INGKA Foundation and Inter Ikea Group. </p> <p>\u201cHis death has no impact on the foundation or the companies at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has no impact beyond the loss of him as a founder and an icon. It\u2019s a huge loss but if you look at the company structure, nothing will change. His personal wealth is very limited.\u201d</p> <p>Kamprad was married twice. In 1973 he moved to Denmark, before seeking to lower his tax bill by moving to Switzerland. He returned to live in Sweden in 2014.</p> <p>The billionaire had a reputation for penny pinching, which he claimed helped Ikea become one of the world\u2019s top brand names, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/ikea-billionaire-ingvar-kamprad-buys-his-clothes-at-second-hand-stalls\">wore secondhand clothes bought at flea markets</a>. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the nature of Sm\u00e5land to be thrifty,\u201d he said in a documentary released in 2016, referring to Sweden\u2019s southern agricultural region where he was born. \u201cIf we want to be cost-conscious, we should do it, not just talk about how cost-conscious we are.\u201d</p> <p>The Ikea founder had faced questions over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/25/ikea-ingvar-kamprad-new-nazi-claims\">past involvement with Nazi groups</a>, which he admitted in a 1999 book about his life and described as his \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d, asking for forgiveness for his \u201cstupidity\u201d. He also admitted to Swedish media that he had attended meetings of Nazi organisations between 1945 and 1948.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/jul/20/shopping.homes\">Kamprad grew up on a farm in southern Sweden</a>. He turned into a budding entrepreneur aged five selling matches to his neighbours. As a teenager he graduated to selling seeds, pens and nylon stockings from his bicycle.</p> <p>He founded Ikea in 1943 and began selling affordable furniture five years later; the first mail-order catalogue came out in 1951. In 1955, the Ikea employee Gillis Lundgren had the idea of removing the legs from a table and tucking them under its top to create the firm\u2019s trademark flat-pack furniture, which was easier and cheaper to transport. Ikea\u2019s first store outside Sweden opened in Norway in 1963 and it began colonising Europe; the first US store opened in 1985.</p> <p>The initial success of Ikea\u2019s no-nonsense furniture was ascribed to the Swedes\u2019 obsession with functionalism. Lars Engman, Ikea\u2019s then design manager, said in 2003: \u201cSweden created the Volvo, Italy the Ferrari.\u201d The bright colours of the products were designed as an antidote to Sweden\u2019s long, dark winters.</p> <p>Jesper B\u00f6rjesson, a TV reporter who, like Kamprad, was born in \u00c4lmhult municipality and was the last to interview him, said Kamprad had continued to play a role in the company until last year, with executive training taking place at his house.</p> <p>\u201cHe lived upstairs and that was his flat, and then downstairs was where he took some of the meetings, and I think it was where he grew up, so it was very symbolic.\u201d</p> <p>B\u00f6rjesson said Kamprad had been pleased to return to \u00c4lmhult, where the first Ikea store was opened and where the firm\u2019s head offices are still based. \u201cHe was so happy to have moved home again, and he got to meet his old friends, and he could sit there in the countryside at his home and contemplate. </p> <p>\u201cI think everybody is sad today, but he\u2019s talked about his death for a long time.

      "bodyText": "Taken at face value the latest employment figures and last year\u2019s GDP growth defied the doomsayers. They were better than the City expected and, for those sitting inside the Treasury, supported the view that Britain\u2019s economy remains, in the finance ministry\u2019s parlance, steady and resilient. The number of people in employment hit a record high and the percentage of those aged 16 to 64 in the workforce was at its joint highest since 1971. Job vacancies were at an all-time high and wages growth ticked higher to 2.4%. Philip Hammond may be waiting nervously for the end of the month to arrive and for HMRC to declare how much the self-employed have paid in tax, but the sheer number of people in work means he can count on tax receipts rolling into the Treasury\u2019s coffers regardless. There are other reasons to be cheerful. The credit boom has played only a marginal role in supporting high street sales. So an imminent crackdown by the City regulators on reckless lending by the banks should itself have only a marginal effect on consumer spending. There is a social cost to thousands of families being plunged into shocking levels of debt. Yet for those sitting inside the Treasury, that\u2019s a separate matter. December\u2019s deal with Brussels provided another fillip to the economy. If no agreement to move beyond the first stage of Brexit talks had been reached, business and consumer confidence would probably have plummeted. The deal to move to the second stage of talks came too late to influence the GDP growth figures for the last quarter of 2017. Nevertheless, the 0.5% registered by the Office for National Statistics meant the economy had expanded at a steady pace. That brings us to the end of the good news. On a more downbeat note, for some time Britain\u2019s economy has sailed along on a wave of consumer spending and without it, the economy will suffer. High street stores have already reported dramatic falls in takings as workers struggle to make their pay packets stretch when inflation is at 3%. The ONS said last week that the underlying picture was of \u201cslower and uneven growth across the economy\u201d as it pointed out that the better-than-expected figures had been driven in part by recruitment and lettings agencies responding to soaring vacancies and to the shortage of rental properties. That\u2019s not the kind of growth Britain needs. In truth Britain has relied for too long on people buying stuff and a booming property market to push up GDP. There needs to be a greater emphasis on investment to build a sustainable economic future. However, in the short term, this causes a huge amount of pain, not least because investment takes a long time to feed through into measurable economic activity. A sensible government would ease the transition with its own investment. Will this happen? Not in an era of austerity that the chancellor says must continue until the middle of the next decade. Hammond has shifted the dial a little in favour of transport projects, though not ageing schools, hospitals and council amenities, which continue to decay. That leaves the economy trundling along and vulnerable to shocks. And these could come in many guises. The first is the March deadline for securing a Brexit transition deal. When a small army of Tory MPs objects strongly to a close relationship with Brussels, arguing that Leave should mean Leave after March 2019, it is not clear there will be one. If the worst should happen and Theresa May is forced to abandon a transition deal, business confidence will evaporate. And that would spell the end of the recovery. May must avoid this doomsday scenario at all costs. Especially when there are plenty of other risks, from a stuttering property market to booming stock and bond markets that betray their fragility. Without a beneficial deal with Brussels, it will be curtains for Britain\u2019s steady and resilient economy. Presidents Club diners: take a long look in the mirror! The Presidents Club has closed, disbanded in shame after the revolting nature of its annual dinner at the Dorchester was exposed by the Financial Times. The prime minister was appalled by reports that female \u201chostesses\u201d at the dinner were groped, harassed and propositioned. Charities don\u2019t want the club\u2019s tainted money. The Charities Commission is investigating. Not every diner behaved badly, of course, but none claim that the Presidents Club misrepresented the nature of its fundraiser. This was a men-only affair and the auction lots include a night at a strip club and a course of plastic surgery to \u201cspice up your wife\u201d. Those rich and privileged businessmen who attended will know that in future their staff \u2013 male and female \u2013 will regard them differently. Such behaviour does not arise out of thin air, of course. Sexism and the objectification of women are a wider problem for society. But the chorus of condemnation was so loud on this occasion because the outside world expects those at the top of the business world \u2013 if their claims to be a force for good mean anything \u2013 to operate to higher standards. The diners should ask themselves now whether they are abusing their power in other ways. Do their workers \u2013 unlike the women obliged to sign non-disclosure agreements at the Presidents Club \u2013 have sufficient rights of complaint? Are their companies really committed to equality of opportunity, a process that means more than signing the usual charters? Is their corporate culture really up to the mark? Some, one suspects, are beyond reform. Others, one hopes, will look at themselves honestly in the mirror and ask whether they could do more. If they couldn\u2019t spot the neon-lit warning signs about the Presidents Club, they should wonder what else they\u2019ve missed. Davos thinkers must be careful what they wish for What a difference six months can make. Last summer President Emmanuel Macron was struggling with a sluggish economy and falling approval ratings. In the US, president Donald Trump, unable to grasp how Congress needed a degree of bipartisanship to smooth the path of legislation, had no laws to his name and was under the same ratings pressure. In Davos, while continuing to face domestic political pressures, both men have found themselves swept along the World Economic Forum\u2019s red carpets on a wave of economic good news. Upgrades to the global outlook for growth are so common they hardly rank as news. The International Monetary Fund was the latest to say that 2018 and 2019 will see higher growth than previously forecast. This year that means 3.9%; in 2016 global growth was 3.1%. Macron is benefiting from the eurozone recovery after years of crises. Trump has found a way to pass a tax bill that will boost the US economy for a year or two, albeit with a hangover that will push the US national debt to new heights. There are plenty of analysts who predict that this improvement will profit most of the world\u2019s developed economies and give workers the confidence to bargain up wages in a way they haven\u2019t managed since the early 00s. The well-paid thinkers at the Davos forum are not so simple as to take this at face value. They can foresee risks to the rosy outlook from a range of developments, some of them, indeed spawned by Trump\u2019s tax bill. In particular, they fear the intense speculation on global financial markets that inevitably comes with a trillion-dollar tax cut. That is why attendees wonder whether cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will be their nemesis. Or will it be their own complacency, which allows growth today to become so unequal that it is unsustainable?",

The prime minister was appalled by reports that female \u201chostesses\u201d at the dinner were groped, harassed and propositioned. Charities don\u2019t want the club\u2019s tainted money. The Charities Commission is investigating.</p> \n<p>Not every diner behaved badly, of course, but none claim that the Presidents Club misrepresented the nature of its fundraiser. This was a men-only affair and the auction lots include a night at a strip club and a course of plastic surgery to \u201cspice up your wife\u201d. Those rich and privileged businessmen who attended will know that in future their staff \u2013 male and female \u2013 will regard them differently.</p> \n<p>Such behaviour does not arise out of thin air, of course. Sexism and the objectification of women are a wider problem for society. But the chorus of condemnation was so loud on this occasion because the outside world expects those at the top of the business world \u2013 if their claims to be a force for good mean anything \u2013 to operate to higher standards.</p> \n<p>The diners should ask themselves now whether they are abusing their power in other ways. Do their workers \u2013 unlike the women obliged to sign non-disclosure agreements at the Presidents Club \u2013 have sufficient rights of complaint? Are their companies really committed to equality of opportunity, a process that means more than signing the usual charters? Is their corporate culture really up to the mark?</p> \n<p>Some, one suspects, are beyond reform. Others, one hopes, will look at themselves honestly in the mirror and ask whether they could do more. If they couldn\u2019t spot the neon-lit warning signs about the Presidents Club, they should wonder what else they\u2019ve missed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c983031b411842b775dd56dbcb316957ec92329\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c983031b411842b775dd56dbcb316957ec92329/466_0_3655_2194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scoring a few points: Emmanuel Macron, president of France, speaking at Davos last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scoring a few points: Emmanuel Macron, president of France, speaking at Davos last week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Davos thinkers must be careful what they wish for</h2> \n<p>What a difference six months can make.

They can foresee risks to the rosy outlook from a range of developments, some of them, indeed spawned by Trump\u2019s tax bill.

      "bodyText": "The ghost at the feast during the annual Venice seminar held by the Italian government for British and Italian journalists last weekend was the shadow of Brexit. While Italian officials were scrupulously reticent about voicing opinions on the subject, the undercurrents were obvious \u2013 not least because the Italians value the UK as an \u201coutward-looking\u201d ally in some of the more introspective discussions in Brussels. Reports from Davos, too, show bafflement on the part of fellow Europeans and others about the UK referendum and subsequent debate. Back in London, the first item I came across on the Today programme was the sound of economist and former Conservative minister Jim O\u2019Neill saying that, although he was a Remainer, Brexit was really not so bad. But the main reason for this appeared to be the upturn in world economy, and in continental Europe \u2013 our main market, which the Brexiters want to leave. Later in the week we had David Cameron saying Brexit was \u201ca mistake, not a disaster\u201d. In both these cases, and many others, including regular proclamations from the Daily Mail, the main point has been missed. The main point is that Brexit has not actually happened. The serious damage, unless the British people change their minds, has yet to come. Yet already it is evident that the UK is a laggard in the world economic recovery, and that investment plans are being shelved at the mere prospect of Brexit. Now, in recent weeks we have seen olive branches being extended by President Macron of France and Donald Tusk, president of the European council. While the French are quite content to look for financial pickings that Brexit might offer them, it is abundantly clear Macron would prefer us to remain. However, the so-called \u201cnegotiations\u201d tend to go around in circles. The British side persistently ask for concessions, in demands that are tantamount to a wish to enjoy all the benefits of EU membership while officially going through the departure gate. How many times do Michel Barnier and others have to repeat that \u201ccherry-picking\u201d and \u201chaving your cake and eating it\u201d are simply not on? The hard fact is that, if we are intent on leaving, we have few cards. The ultimate irony is that, as members of the European Union, we have been able to cherry-pick to a point where we enjoyed all sorts of concessions: although late joiners, we were still able to negotiate the famous budget rebate; we did not have to join the eurozone or the Schengen arrangement; and, notwithstanding the misinformation that streams from the Brexit camp, we possess a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card from any moves by the others towards \u201cever closer union\u201d. This is a very important point, of which many people concerned about sovereignty do not seem to be aware. Non-membership of the eurozone gave a freedom to policymakers that countries such as Italy do not possess. When Italy joined the euro it lost the flexibility to adjust its exchange rate to keep competitive pace with low-inflation Germany. This affected its manufacturing sector (which, by the way, is twice the size of the much-depleted British manufacturing sector). The financial crisis and the constraints of the eurozone precipitated a 10% collapse in Italy\u2019s national product between 2009 and 2013. Recently there has been a gradual recovery, and the economy is growing in line with the eurozone average. There is an unresolved debate as to how much this is due to \u201ccyclical\u201d factors \u2013 the expansionary policies of the European Central Bank \u2013 and how much is \u201cstructural\u201d, that is, attributable to boosts to productivity from manufacturers who can no longer rely on exchange rate adjustments within the single currency area. Which brings us to the unfortunate observation that, in spite of the UK\u2019s freedom from the constraints of the euro, our present and prospective economic performance is widely considered to be abysmal. More and more commentators make the point that the Brexit referendum vote was the culmination of a series of winters of economic and social discontent, which have to be addressed. I could not agree more! But this does not destroy the case for, one way or another, reversing the referendum result. Going ahead with Brexit can only aggravate these sources of discontent. Finally, a reminder of that revealing quote a year ago from Dominic Cummings, one of Boris Johnson\u2019s accomplices in the referendum battlebus campaign. To the question whether the Brexiters would have won without the \u00a3350m National Health Service claim, he replied: \u201cAll our research and the close result strongly suggests no.\u201d",

Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to \u201ctake back control\u201d of laws, borders and money&nbsp;would not have been fulfilled.

That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A \u201cNorway-minus\u201d deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access.

But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to diverge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other \u201cnon-tariff barriers\u201d to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May\u2019s direction so far.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>No deal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes.
