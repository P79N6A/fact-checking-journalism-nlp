      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has been accused of unlawful behaviour by the Bank of England after it emerged its traders had manipulated interest rates in order to cut fees for its emergency lifeline at the height of the financial crisis. The latest chapter of disgrace in the Libor rigging scandal left Lloyds with a bill of \u00a3226m, including \u00a3218m of fines from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. It also exposed a new form of manipulation, which has resulted in the 24% taxpayer-owed bank being forced to repay \u00a38m to the Bank of England. The revelations unleashed an angry attack by Mark Carney, the Bank of England's governor, who said: \"Such manipulation is highly reprehensible, clearly unlawful and may amount to criminal conduct on the part of the individuals involved.\" The case is a setback to the two-year-long attempt by the industry to clean up its reputation in the wake of Barclays' fine for Libor rigging. The fines imposed on Lloyds \u2013 the third largest ever levied by the City's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) \u2013 covered two main issues: rigging Libor, for which seven other institutions have already been punished; and for the first time, manipulating another rate, known as the repo rate. This repo rate was used to calculate the scale of the fees paid to the Bank of England for its special liquidity scheme (SLS), which was created in April 2008 to cheapen the prices at which money could be obtained by banks as the credit crisis unfolded. Tracey McDermott, the FCA's director of enforcement and financial crime, said collusion between traders at Lloyds to influence the rate paid to the Bank of England \"at the expense, ultimately, of the UK taxpayer was unacceptable\". As has been the case with other fines for rigging Libor \u2013 used to price \u00a3300tn worth of financial products around the world \u2013 regulators on both sides of the Atlantic published emails and electronic chats exposing evidence of manipulation. In one exchange, a Lloyds trader remarks when asked about reducing a Libor rate: \"Every little helps ... It's like Tescos.\" But Lloyds will also pay \u00a37.8m in compensation to the Bank of England because of the lower fees the bank paid for the SLS, which was closed in January 2012. The enlarged Lloyds group was one of the largest beneficiaries, paying a total of \u00a31.3bn fees by the end of the crisis. The Bank of England said this scheme was intended to help banks get through the worst of the financial crisis, which ultimately forced Lloyds TSB to rescue HBOS, the owner of Halifax and Bank of Scotland, in September 2008. Eventually nearly \u00a320bn of taxpayer money was pumped into the enlarged bank. Carney referred the matter to the Bank's regulation arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, while the Serious Fraud Office said its investigations into Libor were continuing. In response, the Lloyds chairman, Lord Blackwell, said: \"This was truly shocking conduct, undertaken when the bank was on a lifeline of public support.\" The Libor rigging scandal, first exposed by Barclays' \u00a3290m fine two years ago, led to a public outcry and the creation of the parliamentary commission on banking standards. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chaired that commission, said: \"One of the central recommendations of the commission was to ensure that individuals carry responsibility for their decisions and behaviour, and that they will be held accountable when they rig markets.\" Mark Garnier, the Conservative MP who sits on the Treasury select committee, said: \"This is, on the face of it, a deliberate action to defraud the taxpayer. We will need to look at what exactly has been going on. People will be very angry about it and rightly so.\" The fines cover the period 2006 to 2009, before the current Lloyds boss, Antonio Horta-Osorio, took the helm. The FCA fine is likely to go to armed forces charities. The bank's results are due on Thursday and the chancellor, George Osborne, is keen to capitalise on positive news from the bank to signal the selloff of the rest of the taxpayers' stake before the election. Four individuals at Bank of Scotland and Lloyds were involved in or knew about the repo fixing. Twelve were involved in or knew about rigging Libor when priced in sterling, US dollars and Japanese yen, where there was collusion with the Dutch bank Rabobank, which has already been fined for Libor rigging. In total, 22 former and current employees either knew or were involved in rigging, seven of whom were suspended as the fine was announcedon Monday. The Libor fine also covers a period when Bank of Scotland, as part of HBOS, was being rescued by Lloyds. During this period the market was watching banks' submissions to Libor - set by a panel of banks in a number of currencies and based on what they thought their rivals would charge them to borrow - for signs of distress. Bank of Scotland submitters to Libor were given direct instructions to ensure their rates did not appear too high, which might have indicated that the institution was in trouble. An individual at Bank of Scotland responsible for submissions to Libor sent a message to a rival: \"I've been pressured by senior management to bring by rates down into line with everyone else\". Only days previously, the rate had been half a percentage point higher than rivals. But much of the focus was on the impact on the Bank's emergency funding scheme. Owen Watkins, barrister in the corporate team at Lewis Silkin, said: \"This is effectively a fraud on the taxpayer as the SLS was a taxpayer-backed measure. Not only is this reputationally damaging for Lloyds, being at odds with the friendly brand image they are aiming for, it also raises questions as to whether its competitors might have been doing the same thing. It seems that the bad news for banks just keeps on coming.\" The DoJ has also imposed a two year deferred prosecution agreement on Lloyds, subjecting the bank to tight conditions for the next 24 months. Libor has been overhauled since the furore caused by the fines on Barclays and others, including Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS.",

      "bodyText": "We've also learned tonight that Lloyds has suspended seven staff over the conduct that led to today's \u00a3218m fines. My colleague Jill Treanor reports: Among those suspended by Lloyds on Monday were three of the four unnamed individuals cited by the FCA who may have been involved in depriving the Bank of England of emergency funding fees of almost \u00a38m. A total of 22 people are understood to be bound up in the latest regulatory crack-down on benchmark manipulation; six had already been suspended before Monday and the rest have already left the bank. Their identities are not revealed in a series of damning emails and electronic chats released by regulators as they handed out fines. Instead the individuals are referred to as \"manager a\" or \"trader b\". More here, including details of those messages: Lloyds suspends seven people after \u00a3226m bill for rigging interest rates Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, identifies one of the odd elements of Lloyds' ripping off of the Bank of England: ...The fact of a fiddle against the Bank is astonishing and the motivation bewildering. Libor-rigging was understandable in that it was all about personal greed; a few fractions of a percentage point could benefit a trading book and thus produce a bigger end-of-year bonus. By contrast, no personal gain was possible by manipulating SLS submissions because any benefit would accrue to their employer only. The traders appear to have been fuelled by resentment. It \"just keeps going up and up doesn't it?\" grumbled one Bank of Scotland trader about the SLS bill, ignoring the fact that his bank would have gone bust without state support. A purer case of biting the hand that feeds is hard to imagine. Here's his full comment piece: Lloyds repo men default on the moral payments That's a good moment to recap. Lloyds Banking Group has been blasted by the Bank of England after being fined for rigging financial benchmarks, including one used to assess the cost of a liquidity scheme designed to save the banking system. And those responsible face the threat of legal action, with MPs expressing shock that taxpayers could have lost out again. It's the latest scandal to hit the City -- and the first time that a bank has been fined for rigging the cost of the Special Liquidity Scheme, which helped UK banks keep afloat in the crisis. Bank governor Mark Carney has warned that the manipulation of the SLS was 'clearly unlawful', and could constitute criminal action. He told Lloyds in a letter that: In view of the seriousness of this matter, the PRA [Prudential Regulation Authority] will consider whether further action should be taken in relation to the Firms or individuals at the Firms. Lloyds has agreed that the behaviour was unacceptable and \"truly shocking conduct\". It has been fined \u00a3218m by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. It will also pay almost \u00a38m in compensation to the BoE. City regulators hit Lloyds with a \u00a3105m fine; \u00a370m for reporting false information to the BoE, and \u00a335m for failings related to the Libor scandal. Andrew Tyrie, head of the Treasury Committee of parliament, said the bank's actions were \"appalling\", and a reminder of the need to reform Britain's financial sector. A total of 15 staff were involved in the Libor and SLS cases - they've all either left Lloyds or now face disciplinary action. Transcripts released by regulators showed that staff conspired to fix Libor, with one saying that, like Tesco's, \"Every little helped\".... I'll try to update the blog with any more key developments this evening....otherwise, keep watching the website for further developments. Thanks. GW Another influential MP has gone public with his concerns over Lloyds. Mark Garnier, a member of the Treasury committee, said the case is \"really alarming\", and suggested that committee may take a close look at Lloyds. This is, on the face of it, a deliberate action to defraud the taxpayer. We will need to look at what exactly has been going on. People will be very angry about it and rightly so.\" (quotes via Reuters) The Financial Times Mark Odell has collected together some of the messages shared between Lloyds staff while manipulating Libor. Here's one: In July 19, 2007, a Lloyds manager was informed by a Lloyds trader about a request made to another Lloyds trader for a low rate, the trader commented: \u201cevery little helps\u2026 It\u2019s like Tescos\u201d. and another: On August 17 2007, Lloyds Trader A called Broker A saying: \u201cI ain\u2019t got any 3s fixings mate. I\u2019ve got no fixings today. So I can do my LIBORs wherever I f****** want to put them, mate.\u201d More here. Over in America, assistant US Attorney General Leslie Caldwell reminds of why manipulating financial benchmarks is so serious: \"Because investors and consumers rely on LIBOR's integrity, rate-rigging fundamentally undermines confidence in financial markets,\" More condemnation is raining down on Lloyds -- this time from Andrew Tyrie MP, Chairman of the Treasury Committee, who says the behaviour exposed today was \"appalling'. Tyrie, who also chaired the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said Lloyds' case is a reminder of the misconduct that triggered that inquiry. Tyrie says: \u201cThe banks were manipulating LIBOR and the Repo rate, in the process deceiving the Bank of England in its operation of a taxpayer-backed support scheme. \u201cIt was appalling behaviour like this that triggered the creation of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. \u201cOne of the central recommendations of the Commission was to ensure that individuals carry responsibility for their decisions and behaviour, and that they will be held accountable when they rig markets. \u201cThis settlement is part of the much needed clean-up operation. Implementing the Commission\u2019s proposals will be another.\u201d When the first Libor fines were imposed in the summer of 2012, there was palpable shock that traders had conspired to rig a benchmark interest rate by misreporting their borrowing costs. Two years on, and there's little surprise that another bunch of City workers apparently didn't understand, or care, about how markets should work. PA has a timeline of how the Libor fines have landed in the UK: Barclays was the first to settle rate-rigging claims, paying \u00a3290 million in penalties to US and UK regulators in June 2012 - in a scandal which precipitated the resignation of chief executive Bob Diamond. This was followed by \u00a3940 million in fines for Swiss bank UBS six months later. State-backed Royal Bank of Scotland was hit with a \u00a3391 million pay-out while there were penalties of \u00a354 million for City broker ICAP A \u00a3663 million payout for Dutch lender Rabobank last October included pay-outs to authorities in the US, UK and the Netherlands. In May this year, City broker RP Martin was fined \u00a31.3 million by US and UK regulators. As well as being thoroughly reprehensible, diddling the Bank of England out of the full cost of its liquidity scheme didn't even make financial sense for Lloyds. British banks paid a total of \u00a32.6bn to access the Special Liquidity Scheme in 2008 and 2009, with Lloyds responsible for almost half of those fees. It's fiddling of the repo rate that was used to calculate the SLS's fees cost the BoE almost \u00a38m, suggesting Lloyds only saved around \u00a34m -- or 0.3% of its total bill. And of course, it's now repaying the \u00a38m to the BoE, plus \u00a370m in fines. Lloyds share price is remarkably unscathed by today's revelations, trading virtually unchanged at 74.82p this afternoon. The Libor fine should be 'priced in' (we've known for weeks that it was due soon), but the manipulation of the cost of the Bank of England's rescue scheme is an unwelcome new development, that could cause Lloyds some reputational damage. The BBC's Robert Peston shares our shock at the revelation that Lloyds staff deceived the Bank of England when signing up for its liquidity scheme: Sky News is reporting that nine former Lloyds employees now face criminal charges in the US, in their story on today's fines: Lloyds Risks Criminal Action For Fee-Fixing Here's our news story on Lloyds' fines, and the Bank of England's furious reaction to its misconduct, by City editor Jill Treanor: Bank of England blasts Lloyds for rigging bailout funding The Libor-rigging scandal took a new twist on Monday when Lloyds Banking Group faced accusations of unlawful behaviour after being ordered pay compensation to the Bank of England for manipulating the fees it paid for emergency funding during the height of the banking crisis. In addition to \u00a3218m of fines from regulators in the UK and US for rigging the benchmark rate, the 24% taxpayer-owned bank was ordered to pay Threadneedle Street nearly \u00a38m. The fines imposed on Lloyds cover two main issues \u2013 manipulating Libor, for which seven other firms have been punished \u2013 and, for the first time, rigging another rate, known as the repo rate. This repo rate was used to calculate the scale of the fees paid to the Bank of England for its special liquidity scheme (SLS) which was created to pump money into the financial system amid fears banks were facing a credit crisis. The Bank of England said Lloyds' manipulation of the repo rate was \"highly reprehensible and clearly unlawful\"..... Full story here. The Bank of England has just released an exchange of letters between governor Mark Mark Carney and Lloyds chairman Lord Blackwell earlier this month, ahead of today's fines. In his letter, Carney expresses that Bank's clear outrage that Lloyds tried to manipulate the cost of the Special Liquidity Scheme scheme that was designed to rescue it (details here), Carney writes: Such manipulation is highly reprehensible, clearly unlawful and may amount to criminal conduct on the part of the individuals involved. It reduced not only the amount of fees payable by the Firms but also the fees payable by other firms using the SLS. The Bank's calculations show that the total reduction in fees received by the Bank may have been as high as \u00a37.76 million. Please confirm that the Firms accept liability and will compensate the Bank accordingly. The Bank's Chief Legal Adviser will separately contact your General Counsel. In view of the seriousness of this matter, the PRA will consider whether further action should be taken in relation to the Firms or individuals at the Firms. In reply, Lord Blackwell said he \"absolutely shared\" the Bank's concerns over the SLS conduct, especially the implication that this reduced fees paid by all banks. He writes: This was truly shocking conduct , undertaken when the Bank was on a lifeline of public support. Blackwell confirmed that Lloyds will forward the \u00a37.76m compensation \"as soon as convenient.\" If not sooner, I'd suggest. As with previous cases, Lloyds staff have been remarkable indiscreet when discussing about how to fix Libor rates. One trader even quoted Tesco's famous maxim \"Every Little Helps\" when agreeing to assist. Lloyds says that all the individuals involved have either left the Group, been suspended or are subject to disciplinary proceedings. So, how many Lloyds staff were involved? According to the FCA, four individuals manipulated the repo rate to drive down the cost of the Special Liquidity Scheme -- two at Lloyds Banking Group and two at Bank of Scotland. And sixteen individuals at the firms, were involved in the Libor failings - including one manager who was also caught up in the SLS manipulation. Lloyds staff broke the rules regarding the Libor benchmark (at which banks would lend to each other) in several ways. That includes \"colluding\" with Dutch bank Rabobank to change the Yen Libor rate, to benefit both firms' trading positions. And Bank of Scotland staff also manipulated their submissions for GBP and US dollar Libor, on a manager's orders. The FCA says this was done to avoid \"negative media comment and market perception in respect of its financial stability during the financial crisis\". Back in 2008, investors and journalists were watching the Libor rate closely to see whether banks had lost confidence in each other. Lloyds has issued a statement, saying it \"condemns\" the actions of the individuals responsible for manipulating the SLS fees, and for Libor failings. Lord Blackwell, Lloyds Banking Group's Chairman, insisted that only a small number of staff were involved: \"The Board regards the actions of these individuals between 2006 and 2009 as completely unacceptable. Their behaviour involved a gross breach of trust and we condemn it without reservation. I have written to the Governor of the Bank of England to make clear we have a common view on this. I am also convinced that it is entirely unrepresentative of the vast majority of our staff who are committed to delivering outstanding service and doing the right thing for customers, recognising that trust is at the core of our business.\" The Bank of England has issued a blistering statement on the news that Lloyds has been fined \u00a370m for rigging the cost of its Special Liquidity Scheme. The BoE points out that taxpayers lost out, especially as the actions of Lloyds staff meant that other banks also paid lower fees for taking part in the SLS*. The BoE says: The Bank put the SLS in place to help banks get through the worst of the financial crisis. The fact that Lloyds and Bank of Scotland, the largest beneficiaries of this assistance, manipulated their three month GBP Repo Rate submissions in order to reduce fees is highly reprehensible and clearly unlawful. Not only were fees payable by Lloyds and Bank of Scotland reduced as a result of this conduct, so too were fees payable by other firms using the SLS. The compensation payment takes this fully into account. * - Lloyds staff did this by manipulating their submissions for the \"Repo Rate\" submissions, which showed the prices they'd pay to trade in the repo market -- which lets firms swap assets for cash. This is remarkable. Lloyds is also being fined for attempting to manipulate the fees payable to the Bank of England for the firms\u2019 participation in the Special Liquidity Scheme (SLS). The SLS was the taxpayer-backed government scheme set up to save Britain's banks during the height of the financial crisis, by encouraging them to lend. But Lloyds traders, we now learn, decided to manipulate the \"Repo Rate benchmark\", to lower the fees they would have to pay to the Bank of England for participation in the SLS. A large slice of Lloyds' fine from the FCA (\u00a370m of the \u00a3105m total) is for this offence. The FCA says it's \"an extremely serious failing\". Tracey McDermott, the FCA\u2019s director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \u201cThe firms were a significant beneficiary of financial assistance from the Bank of England through the SLS. Colluding to benefit the firms at the expense, ultimately, of the UK taxpayer was unacceptable. This falls well short of the standards the FCA and the market is entitled to expect from regulated firms Lloyds is paying \u00a37.76 million compensation to the Bank of England for this misconduct. I believe this the first time that a UK bank has been fined for this sort of misconduct \u2013 biting the hand that was feeding them the emergency funding they needed to keep running. The full statement is here. News is breaking that Lloyds Banking Group has been fined more than \u00a3200m for failings related to key financial benchmarks, including Libor. The bank, 24% owned by the taxpayer, has just become the latest bank to be punished over the Libor scandal, in which traders conspired to fix benchmark interest rates. Lloyds been fined by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, as well as US regulators. The FCA has fined Lloyds \u00a3105m for \"serious Libor failings, and 'other benchmark failings\". America's CFTC has charged Lloyds with manipulation, attempted manipulation and false reporting of Libor, and hit it with a $105m civil penalty. And the US Department of Justice is fining Lloyds a further $86m. We make that a grand total of \u00a3218m, or $370m More details, and reaction, to follow... The Financial Times has pulled together a short Q&amp;A on the Yukos court ruling: Here's a flavour: Will Russia pay? The award is final and binding and therefore cannot be appealed. However, Moscow has already said that it plans to exhaust all legal avenues to protect its interests and it can appeal to a Dutch court to overturn the judgment. While the outcome of such a so-called \u201csetting aside\u201d motion would be unclear, it could delay enforcement of the award. If the Russian government still refuses to pay following a final ruling, the plaintiffs would have to pursue Russian assets, which could be anything that belongs to the Russian state overseas, through national courts in other countries to satisfy their claim. This would be a lengthy and complex process. Certain kinds of state assets, including central bank reserves as well as diplomatic and military property, are protected by state immunity. The landmark Yukos court ruling comes as Russian companies brace for further economic sanctions. Brussels is due to announce details of its crackdown on Tuesday, and that \u2013 rather than events in the Hague \u2013 is the number one issue for Moscow, says Denis Poryvai, an analyst at Raiffeisen bank. Poryvai told Reuters: \"Against the background of the sanctions that the EU is mulling against Russia this week, (the court decision) is secondary news for the market,\" And that market is still down around 2% today. So what might these new sanctions entail? Well, the EU agreed in principle to implement new restrictions 10 days ago, the day before the Malaysia Airline's MH17 crashed in Ukraine. That tragedy has hardened Europe's resolve, despite worries about gas supplies Analysts at Eurasia Group think ministers will agree to sanction elements of Russia's finance, defense and energy sectors. The US, which has announced measures against banks and oil companies already, is likely to take further steps too. And Russia is likely to retaliate. Eurasia say: Most likely, Russia will suspend observance of a major arms control treaty, such as START. In addition, Russia will apply at least informal retaliation against US companies, impairing their operations through health and safety inspections and customs delays. This process has already begun against McDonalds. Shares in Rosneft, which bought many of Yukos's assets a decade ago, have fallen almost 2.8% today following the court ruling. Rosneft shares have now fallen 14% since the end of June, as the geopolitical crisis over Ukraine escalated. The main Moscow stock market, the Micex composite index, is down 2% today. Here's one of the many assets which Yukos lost when it collapsed a decade ago under the weight of Moscow's tax demands: Yuganskneftegaz is a wholly integrated subsidiary of Rosneft. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former boss of Yukos, has just issued a statement on today's court ruling. In it, he confirms that he is not looking to benefit financially from the case. And he also points out that the cost of the ruling will fall on the state, not the \"Mafiosi\" involved. Khodorkovsky says: \u201cIt is with a feeling of satisfaction that I have learned about the award by the Permanent Court of Arbitration. It is the first independent tribunal to have considered the YUKOS case in its entirety, to have examined the evidence and to have heard witness testimony. The findings were predictable for any unbiased observer of the disgraceful Basmannyi travesty of justice: from beginning to end, the YUKOS case has been an instance of unabashed plundering of a successful company by a mafia with links to the State. It is fantastic that the company shareholders are being given a chance to recover their damages. It is sad that the recompense will have to come from the State\u2019s coffers, not from the pockets of Mafiosi linked to the powers that be and those of Putin\u2019s oligarchs. I am taking this opportunity to confirm that I am not a party to these legal proceedings and I do not seek to benefit financially from their outcome.\" Over in Israel, Yukos investor and business magnate Leonid Nevzlin says he's 'pleased' with today's verdict (as I guess one would be): LEONID NEVZLIN SAYS HE'S PLEASED HAGUE COURT RULED RUSSIA ILLEGALLY NATIONALISED YUKOS Nevzlin is the biggest beneficiary of today's ruling, having bought Mikhail Khodorkovsky's stake back in 2004. Russia has 180 days to meet the ruling, according to lawyers representing the Yukos shareholders. After 15 January 2015, interest will start racking up. Russia had already pledged to fight the ruling, Associated Press reports: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, commenting earlier Monday, said Russia will be appealing the ruling. \"Authorities who are representing Russia in this trial will use all possible legal means to defend their position,\" Lavrov said. Yukos's corporate structure does look rather complex, including a swathe of holding companies and international divisions (there's a blurry chart at the end of the ruling) I've just recropped the images in the last entry, so refreshing your browser should make them a little clearer. Having made its ruling, the Permanent Court had to determine a fair value for Yukos's assets today. It decided that Yukos did bear some responsibility for its demise, and cut the total payout by 25%. This table, buried at the back of the ruling, outlines the decision to award Yukos's major shareholders over $50bn: (if it's hard to read, check out this larger version on the FT) Vladimir Putin may have accidentally handed Yukos the proof it needed that the sale of its assets to Rosneft was politically motivated. Speaking at a press conference in 2004, the Russian president told reporters that the state was \"looking after its own interests\", having seen valuable assets snaffled on the cheap in Russia's 1990s privatisation drive. Joseph Cotterill of the FT highlights the key section (it's on page 464). In their defence, the Russian authorities had insisted that Yukos had \"fraudulently evaded billions of dollars of tax\" between 1999 to 2004, by setting up 'sham trading shells' in Russian regions with lower tax rates. They accused its oligarch owners of building their investments through \"illegal acts and bad faith\" conduct. As the Russian Federation put it (their case begins on page 34): Yukos abused the low-tax region program, and evaded Russian corporate profit tax in violation of the bad faith taxpayer doctrine, by implementing what Yukos referred to internally as its \u201ctax optimization\u201d scheme. Pursuant to this scheme, Yukos established dozens of sham \u201ctrading companies\u201d in low-tax regions that had no business purpose, and then shifted its own profits to the sham trading companies. These sham trading shells had no genuine economic substance and served no purpose other than to reduce Yukos\u2019 tax liabilities, an arrangement described by Yukos\u2019 own lawyers as constituting unlawful tax evasion. However, the Permanent Court of Arbitration concluded that Russia's actions went beyond simple tax collection, and was bent on crushing the company. They say (on page 255): After having now traversed, at some length, the treatment of Yukos by Russian tax authorities, the bailiffs and the courts, and having considered the totality of the evidence, especially the VAT evidence, the Tribunal has concluded that the primary objective of the Russian Federation was not to collect taxes but rather to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its valuable assets. Today's ruling has some fascinating detail about the intersection between politics and business in Vladimir Putin's Russia. On page 62, for example, former chief economic advisor Andrei Illarionov told the court that Yukos was \"one of the most dangerous enemies for those who did not want to see Russia a free country. Here's a flavour: According to Dr. Illarionov, the arrests of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and [chief executive] Lebedev and the dismantlement of Yukos were politically and economically motivated. Yukos\u2019 intended merger with Western oil majors was seen as a national betrayal and a hurdle to expropriation. Dr. Illarionov describes the 19 February 2003 meeting at the Kremlin between President Putin and business leaders, at which Mr. Khodorkovsky made a presentation on corruption, to which President Putin responded that everyone knew how various assets, including Yukos, were acquired, and told Mr. Khodorkovsky: \u201cI return the ball in your corner.\u201d The tone of the meeting became \u201csteely and menacing\u201d as if something had gone \u201creally wrong.\u201d Five months later, in July 2003, Lebedev was arrested. Khodorkovsky himself was arrested that October, charged with fraud and tax evasion. Tim Osborne, director of GML (the Yukos shareholders), says: \u201cWe are thrilled with this decision, although we know it is not the end of the road.\u201d That's via the New York Times, which also flags up that the ruling probably won't benefit Mikhail Khodorkovsky himself: It is unlikely Mr. Khodorkovsky will benefit financially from the verdict, as he contends he handed over his stake to a partner, Leonid B. Nevzlin, who lives in Israel, in 2005. The victorious Yukos investors are holding a press conference in London now. My colleague Jennifer Rankin is tweeting from it: The court ruling over the Yukos case is online here. It's over 600 pages long. The size of the compensation payment comes on page 521. Tthe Tribunal has decided to award Claimants post- award interest on the damages of USD 50,020,867,798 for which the Tribunal has found Respondent liable. Rosneft, which ended up with many of Yukos's energy assets after the company collapsed, is denying that any wrongdoing took place. It doesn't expect to pay any of the $50bn compensation claim. RUSSIA'S ROSNEFT SAYS ALL DEALS REGARDING ACQUISITION OF YUKOS ASSETS WERE LEGAL RUSSIA'S ROSNEFT BELIEVES THAT NO CLAIMS CAN BE MADE TO THE COMPANY DUE TO THE HAGUE COURT RULING ON YUKOS Reuters is snapping more details of the Yukos ruling: RUSSIAN COURTS \"BENT\" TO BANKRUPT YUKOS, JAIL POLITICAL RIVAL - HAGUE COURT ROSNEFT OFFICIALS WORKING FOR PRESIDENT PUTIN, IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AIMED AT DESTROYING YUKOS - COURT Russia has been ordered to pay $50bn to the shareholders in former oil company Yukos, to compensate them for the loss of valuable assets a decade ago. In a blow to Moscow, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague has just ruled in favour of five investors including former Yukos chief executive, Platon Lebedev. It's one of the biggest arbitration awards ever made against a sovereign state, and comes after a nine-year legal battle. Yukos was created by former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man. The company collapsed after being hit with a $27bn tax bill, and its oil fields and other assets were sold to another major oil company, Rosneft. Khodorkovsky was jailed for ten years; seen as part of president Putin's crackdown on billionaires with political interests. Khodorkovsky sold off his own interest in Yukos to pay his legal expenses, but this case was brought by the other major investors, who had been seeking $100bn. Reaction to follow.... Michael Heise, chief economist of fund manager Allianz, is worried about the deteriorating relations between Russia and the West, saying \"the situation is very dangerous.\" \"An escalation carries large risks for the economy. \"There is a big risk from further sanctions although one has to accept that clear (diplomatic) signals are needed.\" Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is struck by the financial markets' refusal to react to the geopolitical tensions dominating the news: If there has been any good news in the Ukraine conflict or in Gaza I missed it, but while the rubble has weakened somewhat over the last week, even the Turkish Lira has held up. That speaks to the dominance of the risk-friendly global backdrop as low US rates and continued, albeit modest global growth trump almost anything else. Stan Shamu of IG says investors are still watching Ukraine closely: European leaders are reportedly considering further restrictions on Russia\u2019s access to capital markets and this is likely to remain a talking point this week. Russia's MICEX stock index has dropped by 0.75% so far today, as the prospect of new sanctions loom over Moscow. It's a somewhat subdued start to trading in Europe, where the main stock markets have all risen a little. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 15 points or 0.25%, led by consumer giant Reckitt Benckiser (+3%) which announced plans to spin off its pharmaceuticals arm this morning. Germany's DAX is flat, though, reflecting concerns that tougher sanctions on Russia could hurt German firms. Shares in Ryanair have jumped 5% in early trading, as traders welcome its raised profit forecasts. Budget airline Ryanair has added to the optimism in the markets this morning, by hiking its profit forecasts. After hitting investors with some nasty profit warnings in 2013, CEO Michael O'Leary was on more comfortable ground this morning. Ryanair reported a 152% jump in net profits in the first three months of this financial year -- partly due to the late timing of Easter. It also hiked its profit guidance to \u20ac620m-\u20ac650m, from \u20ac580m-\u20ac620m. O'Leary said Ryanair's new bases in Athens, Brussels, Lisbon and Rome are \"performing strongly\", and declared that European airports are falling over each other to get Ryanair onside: \"We are overrun with growth offers from primary European airports whose incumbent flag and regional carriers continue to cut capacity and traffic,\" The Nikkei's rally was also driven by hopes that Japanese car makers will report decent earnings this week. Ryota Sakagami, chief equity strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, predicted that the index could \"quickly push toward 16,000 [points], possibly by the end of August.\" Japan's stock market has hit its highest level since late January, driven by economic optimism and the prospect of decent company earnings. The Nikkei has closed at 15529, up 71 points, a point not reached since late January. Signs that the Asian economies are improving drove shares up across the region, led by China, where the Shanghai market jumped over 2%. Overnight, the Beijing government announced that profits at China's industrial companies had soared by 17.9% last month, compared to June 2103. That's being taken as another sign that mini-stimulus measures implemented in recent months are paying off (despite ongoing fears that the Chinese property market is in trouble). And Chinese industrial earnings over the first six months of 2014 have jumped by 11.4%, a record high. There are also signs that Asian traders are more relaxed about the crisis in Ukraine. Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo, said: \"Geopolitical concerns remain as the conflict in the Ukraine does not look like it will end soon, but there is some relief spreading that the impact will be contained,\" (via Reuters) Other analysts are more worried that the markets are too relaxed about geopolitics, though -- I\"ll pull a round-up together shortly. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. The pharmaceuticals sector is in focus today, after the boss of GlaxoSmithKline hinted that he could break up the company. Sir Andrew Witty told the FT he's happy to spin off its consumer healthcare business if it would help GSK bounce back from a turbulent year dominated by the Chinese bribery scandal. GSK opens issue of spinning off consumer division And consumer giant Reckitt Benckiser has just announced that it's decided to spin off its pharmaceuticals division, Suboxone, as a separate company. More changes, in a sector gripped by takeover fever this year. Not much in the diary this morning, alas, with little economic news to look forward to, but I'll be tracking the main developments through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Coalition government ministers purr with satisfaction if not excitement over the economy reaching 0.8% growth in the second quarter of 2014 to regain 2008 levels (Report, 26 July). Is nobody going to make a comparison with 2010? Office for National Statistics figures show that for the third quarter of 2010 (the last over which Labour can claim any significant influence) growth had reached around 1%. Within three years of the start of the financial crisis Labour had restored growth. The coalition\u2019s excessive austerity plunged the country back into recession followed by several years of flat-lining. Growth has returned in spite of, not because of, the government. Such \u201cplans\u201d as the government had were abandoned as \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing (which no one condemned as the equivalent of printing money) was pumped into the economy.

Dr Richard Carter London \u2022 It\u2019s very kind of the Mexican billionaire, Carlos Slim, to come up with a scheme for making ordinary people work into their 70s (Report, 21 July). It goes to show we\u2019ve come a long way from the 1980s, when we were told that the problem of the 21st century would be what to do with our vastly increased leisure time because of the miraculous advances of technology. Instead we have longer working hours, low wages and rapidly diminishing job security. The technology has indeed improved productivity but instead of this improving the lives of working people it has been hoovered up by the mega-rich, leaving the gap between them and the rest of us wider than ever. Pete Cresswell Liverpool \u2022 Carlos Slim\u2019s suggestion that we should all work a three-day week is not in our opinion the answer to \u201cwhat is the future of work\u201d but it does raise some important issues. Workload pressures and culture already drive long hours in many workplaces and is an increasing challenge in an ever-demanding world. Working families need time to be together to function well, so asking parents and carers to work longer hours even across fewer days simply adds to their stress and impacts on their performance at work. When every workplace recognises and culturally embraces employee wellbeing and work-life balance and when parents are able to readily access flexible and affordable childcare, equality for fathers at home and for mothers at work will become a reality. If caring and work were shared more equally between men and women, we could achieve a more balanced way of working without mandating a three-day week.

Their first instinct, of course, was to try to fiddle the terms of the banking bailout and rip off the Bank of England. That the trading desks of the two banks were up to their necks in the wider Libor-rigging scandal was known already. The \"highly reprehensible\" element in revelations, as Bank governor Mark Carney put it, is the fact that some employees regarded the state bailout as another opportunity to lie, this time about \"repo\" rates. Submissions were used to calculate the fees Lloyds, Bank of Scotland (as part of Hbos) and other institutions paid to access the Bank of England's hastily-erected Special Liquidity Scheme (SLS). The ruse was to present the banks as stronger than they were, thereby reducing the cost of accessing state funds. The Bank, and thus taxpayers, were taken for fools. The sums were tiny in the scheme of things. The now-unified Lloyds Banking Group will pay \u00a37.76m to compensate the Bank of England, against a total bill of \u00a31.3bn for accessing the SLS. But the fact of a fiddle against the Bank is astonishing and the motivation bewildering. Libor-rigging was understandable in that it was all about personal greed; a few fractions of a percentage point could benefit a trading book and thus produce a bigger end-of-year bonus. By contrast, no personal gain was possible by manipulating SLS submissions because any benefit would accrue to their employer only. The traders appear to have been fuelled by resentment. It \"just keeps going up and up doesn't it?\" grumbled one Bank of Scotland trader about the SLS bill, ignoring the fact that his bank would have gone bust without state support. A purer case of biting the hand that feeds is hard to imagine. Carney says the actions \"may amount to criminal conduct on the part of the individuals concerned,\" so one can assume the Serious Fraud Office has been summoned. But the Financial Conduct Authority's report also makes clear that Lloyds' management should have spotted the risk of dodgy repo submissions. It records a familiar tale of inadequate training and an absence of supervision. On the separate matter of Libor-rigging, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland come across as habitual offenders, albeit not the worst in the industry. Manipulation became a way of life and during the financial crisis Bank of Scotland engaged in \"lowballing\" submissions to avoid exposing itself as a distressed borrower. Who gave the orders? The FCA report is frustrating. \"A senior manager\" is mentioned but it is impossible to tell actual seniority. As so often, the details of \"lowballing\" will be left officially vague. Instead, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland will be remembered as banks that were bailed out by taxpayers and then tried to cheat their rescuer.",

A purer case of biting the hand that feeds is hard to imagine.</p> <p>Carney says the actions \"may amount to criminal conduct on the part of the individuals concerned,\" so one can assume the Serious Fraud Office has been summoned. But the Financial Conduct Authority's report also makes clear that Lloyds' management should have spotted the risk of dodgy repo submissions. It records a familiar tale of inadequate training and an absence of supervision.</p> <p>On the separate matter of Libor-rigging, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland come across as habitual offenders, albeit not the worst in the industry. Manipulation became a way of life and during the financial crisis Bank of Scotland engaged in \"lowballing\" submissions to avoid exposing itself as a distressed borrower.</p> <p>Who gave the orders? The FCA report is frustrating. \"A senior manager\" is mentioned but it is impossible to tell actual seniority.</p> <p>As so often, the details of \"lowballing\" will be left officially vague. Instead, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland will be remembered as banks that were bailed out by taxpayers and then tried to cheat their rescuer.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has said UK interest rates should stay low for now, but the Bank of England policymakers must be ready to raise them should other measures fail to keep the housing market in check. The IMF said that so-called macro-prudential measures should be the \"first line of defence\" against financial stability risks from the housing market. But ultimately more must be done to raise the supply of housing to meet demand, it said, echoing warnings from economists and the Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney. The Washington-based IMF also warned of a check to George Osborne's ambitions to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing, as it warned that sterling was \"moderately overvalued\", while net trade has not been a strong factor in the economic recovery. Nonetheless, confirming its forecast for the UK to be one of the world's fastest expanding big economies, the IMF said the country's \"prospects are promising\". \"Headwinds that previously held back the economy \u2013 including adverse credit conditions and diminished confidence \u2013 have eased. There are signs that demand is becoming more balanced, with growth in business investment now ahead of private consumption. Employment growth has remained strong. Despite this, inflation has been contained,\" it said in its latest report on the UK. The assessment follows the IMF's latest outlook for the world economy last week in which it revised up its UK growth to 3.2% for this year and 2.7% for 2015. But in Monday's report it highlighted several potential risks, warning in particular that sustaining strong growth would depend on a recovery in productivity and in real wages. The IMF said that so far, there were few of the typical signs of a credit-led bubble in the housing market. But the market was \"becoming buoyant\", potentially creating financial stability risks. \"A steady increase in high loan-to-income mortgages implies that households are gradually becoming more vulnerable to falls in income and interest rate shocks,\" the fund said. After more than five years of interest rates at a record low of 0.5%, it was important for the Bank of England to give clear guidance on factors that would influence the path of both its monetary and financial policy committees, the IMF said. \"The Bank will want to reduce the risks of adverse effects from surprises about changes in policy settings, yet not feed spurious certainty about future interest rates,\" said the report, adding that keeping to the accommodative monetary policy was appropriate in the \"immediate term\". The IMF's recent analysis of the UK economy contrasts with its warning last year that Osborne's austerity policies were \"playing with fire\" and could trigger a slump. In this latest report the fund said \"the pace and composition of deficit reduction over the near term is appropriate\", an assessment seized on by the Treasury. A Treasury spokesman said: \"The IMF has today backed up its forecast for the UK to be the fastest growing major advanced economy in the world this year, by agreeing that the government's fiscal strategy is appropriate. \"The government's long term economic plan is working. But the job is not yet done and so we will go on making the realistic assessment of what needs to be done to secure a brighter economic future.\" Although the IMF flagged potential risks from rising house prices, there have been signs in recent weeks that the market has come off the boil. Land Registry figures released on Monday showed that the average house price across England and Wales held steady between May and June at \u00a3172,011. Prices were up 6.4% on a year ago, a slowdown from May's 6.7% annual growth. Against the backdrop of warnings of a possible price bubble, the Bank's financial policy committee introduced measures last month that could bite if house prices rise more than 20% by early 2017. Those measures followed stricter regulations on home loans in April under the mortgage market review.",

Petra Diamonds was in sparkling form, up 5.6p to 216.6p after full revenues reached a record \u00a3278m, up 17%, on record production of 3.1m carats, also up 17%. Numis said: Overall another solid result. The growth programme remains on track and the diamond market firm. We adjust our forecasts ahead of new guidance next month, expecting higher prices, offset by lower forecast production and higher costs over the next few years. We increase our target price to 240p, from 220p, but downgrade to an add recommendation [from buy] on price appreciation. We continue to like the stock and see it as a good investment in the diamond space. Home Retail was 4.5p weaker at 165.7p. Weekend reports suggested the company was considering spinning off its DIY business Homebase from the Argos operations. Traders believe such a move is unlikely in the immediate future, but analyst Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald said a disposal of Homebase would be viewed positively by the market: There is, in our view, now limited overlap with the core Argos business which as part of its new strategy is looking to transform from being a catalogue to digital retailer. Although the disposal of Homebase is likely to be dilutary to earnings, any transaction is likely to highlight the attractions of the core business, Argos, as a potential private equity bid. We are, however, retaining our hold recommendation and reducing our target price to 185p from 215p. Hence, we still need to be convinced that the new Argos strategy is working and that the encouraging results from the new Argos format initiative are maintained. Lower down the market, ULS Technology, which provides an online comparison site for finding the best deal for residential conveyancing solicitors, made a bright start to life on Aim. The company raised \u00a312 from institutional investors at 40p a share, valuing the business at more than \u00a325m. It closed at 43.5p. Finally electronics manufacture Stadium added 7p to 73p after the \u00a38m cash and share purchase of US group United Wireless. House broker N+1 Singer said the deal would add \u00a31m to pre-tax profits with their 2015 forecasts raised to \u00a34.2m from \u00a33.2m.",

    "webTitle": "Jaguar Land Rover blazes a trail for British car manufacturing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inside a giant grey building on the outskirts of Solihull, busy robots and full production lines provide a glimpse of the future of British car manufacturing. An army of state-of-the-art machines is making Jaguar Land Rover's latest vehicle, the fourth generation Range Rover, which JLR hopes will build on the success of four successive years of bumper group sales. There has been renewed concern about the strength of Britain's manufacturing sector recently, but JLR's 40,000 sq m aluminium body shop in the west Midlands is alive with the comforting, audible hum of stuff being made. The silver skeleton of a \"Chelsea tractor\" shudders to a halt on the line as huge orange robotic arms glue parts together and then punch self-piercing rivets into the carcass. There are no dramatic explosions of sparks, because nothing is welded. World-leading technology means each new Range Rover is held together by 170m of super-strong glue and 2,722 rivets, making the vehicle 420kg lighter, and so more fuel-efficient, than its predecessor. If the latest model is as successful, JLR will add to pre-tax profits that reached \u00a32.5bn last year as it sold 434,311 vehicles that pushed revenues to \u00a319.4bn. It is on course to do better than that in the current 12 months. Demand for its smart 4x4s and investment in new factories has prompted an unprecedented recruitment drive. JLR has added more than 11,000 workers in the last three years and now employs 26,000 people around the world, most of them in Britain. The country, however, needs more Jaguar Land Rovers to re-establish it as a manufacturing superpower and to help drag the economy out of the quagmire. The latest official figures show there is some way to go if the government's aim of rebalancing the economy is to become a reality. The Office for National Statistics confirmed last week that the overall economy was back to its pre-crisis peak, but the news on manufacturing was disappointing. The sector grew by just 0.2% in the second quarter of this year, the slowest growth for more than 12 months. JLR is certainly a good role model. Demos Hoursoglou, the manufacturing manager at the Solihull plant, says proudly: \"The technology we use is aircraft technology.\" The record sales, bumper profits and bullish outlook are a far cry from the dark days of 2009, when any future at all was considered pretty optimistic. The financial crisis forced consumers to freeze big money purchases such as new cars. Sales plummeted and JLR was sent skidding towards the buffers. Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate that owns Tetley Tea and Corus, bought JLR from Ford for \u00a31.2bn in early 2008. It made a \u00a3376m loss that year on sales of \u00a34.45bn. By early 2009 it was forced to ask the government for financial aid, but the request was rejected. The outlook was so grim that plans were well advanced to close one of JLR's three British plants \u2013 Halewood in Merseyside, Solihull or nearby Castle Bromwich. Alan Volkaerts, the operations director at Solihull, recalls: \"I felt what it was like to take shifts off and implement pay freezes. At that time, I had 1,000 people in Solihull who were surplus to requirements.\" Instead, Tata scrapped the plan to shut down a plant and decided to invest instead. \"It was clear that in Tata we didn't just have a parent that saw us as a financial entity. They were interested in cars. We couldn't have survived without them,\" Volkaerts says. It was a gamble, but one that has paid handsome dividends. Britain has benefited hugely from the turnaround. Solihull has seen its ranks swell by a third to 7,300 workers in the last two years, while Halewood, which makes the best-selling Evoque mini-Range Rover, has trebled its staff numbers to 4,500 and is working 24-hour shifts for the first time. \"The idea of doing what we are doing now with one less plant is unthinkable,\" Volkaerts says. The upturn in JLR's fortunes has coincided with a strong period for Britain's car industry. Last year, car manufacturing in the UK hit a six-year high, rising 3.1% to more than 1.5m vehicles \u2013 the highest volume since 2007. Dr Ralf Speth, JLR's chief executive, wants to capitalise on the newfound interest in products that are made in Britain and has set an ambitious target of nearly doubling sales to 750,000 by 2015. Tata is backing the plans with investment of \u00a310bn to launch 40 new models within five years, including the Jaguar XE saloon and a sport version of the Land Rover Discovery. It is investing \u00a3500m to build a new plant in Wolverhampton, which will start to produce its own engines for the first time later this year. The marque is also pumping \u00a31bn into establishing a manufacturing base in China, its biggest market, with its joint-venture partner Chery. At Solihull, the carmaker's largest site, the investment is already beginning to show. Older buildings, dating from the 1940s, nestle alongside a pristine visitor centre and the huge grey cathedrals of industry, home to the orange robots and rivet guns. Volkaerts and his team, however, are not sitting back to admire their work just yet. There is a lot more to be done. A second 50,000 sq m aluminium body shop has been opened next to the original, which produces more lightweight shells for Land Rover vehicles such as the Discovery. A third 68,000 sq m hall will open later this year to make aluminium bodies for Jaguars. It will start with production of the XE saloon by the end of the year. The 300-acre Solihull site is a constant hive of activity. Hard-hatted builders and engineers buzz around another huge hangar-sized hall nearby. At 81,000 sq m, the size of 12 football pitches, the facility will \"trim and final\" for Jaguar, the place where vehicle carcasses are \"married\" with their engines, gearboxes and drive shafts. The scale of the investment in the plant is significant in its history, because it will be the first time that a Jaguar rolls off the production line at Solihull, which has traditionally been a Land Rover site. Upgrades to the physical environment are not the only change that Tata has introduced. A different management style has been ushered in, which seeks to re-establish passion and pride for the products among the workforce. Phillip Robbins, a trade union shop steward, has worked at the plant for 21 years and has been through some dark times. He firmly believes Tata has transformed JLR into a lean, mean British challenger to the hegemony of Germany's finest \u2013 BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. \"When I first started, it was exciting. But it was dark, dirty and you could tell it was behind the times. Now it's a lot better,\" Robbins says. \"They have gone a long way towards turning this place into a contender. JLR recognised how much they had to change to keep up with the best. \"We have also noticed a big change in management views since Tata came in. There are men who have been here for 15, 20 years or more who have never even sat in the cars because no one on the floor can afford to buy one. That was one of the main gripes,\" he says. JLR has begun to address this by introducing its Jaguar Alive programme, which allows staff to bring a family member in to work to test drive the cars at weekends. Robbins says the workforce has welcomed the initiative warmly: \"There's a lot of emphasis on making people feel comfortable coming to work. They now recognise that if you have a contented workforce, it helps to bring out the workers' passion for what they do. They are listening to what the workers' gripes are.\" JLR's success has not only been embraced and shared by its workers. The marque's burgeoning workload has fortified a growing army of British suppliers. The company reckons it now helps to support around 190,000 British jobs, both directly and indirectly in the supply chain. As the business grows, so has its appetite for locally sourced car parts. Around half the parts that go into its vehicles come from Britain, and of those half come from the West Midlands - a much higher proportion than other British manufacturers, which average about a third. With sales booming, new factories opening and model launches galore on the horizon, are there any potential potholes in the road? Hoursoglou thinks a shortage of skilled people with a good grounding in core subjects such as maths and science is a potential problem for all manufacturers. \"Young people want to be footballers, pop stars or TV celebrities,\" he says. \"My challenge is to get it into their minds that manufacturing is not the grotty, dirty thing that it used to be.\"",

      "bodyText": "Russia has been ordered to pay $50bn (\u00a329.4bn) to shareholders of Yukos, the formerdefunct oil company that was broken up a decade ago after its boss fell foul of Vladimir Putin. In a judgment against the Kremlin, a tribunal in the Hague ruled that the Russian state had sought to bankrupt Yukos, appropriate its assets and prevent its owner, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, from entering politics. The permanent court of arbitration rejected Moscow's arguments that the assets seizure was driven by tax-collection motives, ruling that the state set out to bankrupt the oil firm in \"a devious and calculated expropriation\". In a damning indictment of the rule of law in Russia, the tribunal found that the country's courts had \"bent to the will of Russian executive authorities\" to \"incarcerate a man who gave signs of becoming a political competitor\". The judgment is a blow to Putin, who led the campaign against Khodorkovsky, and is facing the threat of further western sanctions over the conflict in eastern Ukraine following the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The $50bn damages bill, roughly 2.5% of Russia's economic output, is also bad news for an economy the International Monetary Fund deems to be in recession. Yukos was the largest oil company in Russia when, in 2003, Khodorkovsky was arrested at gunpoint on an airport runway in Siberia. The son of two Moscow engineers and leading light of the Communist party's youth wing during the Soviet era, he had made millions in the controversial privatisations of the 1990s to become Russia's richest man. But he roused Putin's ire by refusing to stay out of politics and served 10 years in jail in what were widely seen as trumped-up charges. Khodorkovsky, who was released in December after a surprise pardon, renounced his claims to Yukos assets during an earlier trial, and restated on Monday that he will not seek to benefit from the Hague court's ruling. The principal victors are the main Yukos shareholders led by Leonid Nevzlin, Khodorkovsky's former business partner, who fled to Israel to avoid prosecution and has a stake of around 70%. Platon Lebedev, another former executive, who was jailed by a Russian court on tax-evasion charges and was released this year, is another victor. About 30,000 ex-employees of Yukos are expected to share in a $458m pension fund that will pay out once damages are collected. In a statement, Khodorkovsky said it was \"fantastic\" that the shareholders were being given a chance to recover their losses, but added that it was sad that \"the recompense will have to come from the state's coffers, not from the pockets of mafiosi linked to the powers that be and those of Putin's oligarchs\". He described the results as predictable for unbiased observers of Moscow's court proceedings. \"From beginning to end, the Yukos case has been an instance of unabashed plundering of a successful company by a mafia with links to the state.\" Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would \"use all possible legal means\" to defend its position. But under the rules of the Hague tribunal, which considered 6,500 pages of evidence, Russia has no right of appeal. The biggest loser could be the state-owned oil company Rosneft, which bought Yukos assets in auctions when the latter's stock was almost worthless. The tribunal concluded that the expropriation had not been carried out to benefit Rosneft, which is controlled by Putin's ally Igor Sechin. The payout is worth almost three-quarters of Rosneft's market value and raises awkward questions for BP, which took a 20% stake in the company in 2012 Tim Osborne, a British lawyer and director of GML, the majority shareholder group, rejected suggestions that Russia would not pay the $50bn in damages, saying: \"We didn't go into this for a pyrrhic victory to make a point. We went into this to get compensation for the loss we suffered.\" He warned, too, that shareholders might target BP to collect damages owed. \"I think it's safe to say that nobody is safe. We will look at everything and we will take a view and it will be a pragmatic approach.\" Emmanuel Gaillard, head of Shearman &amp; Sterling, the lawyer who represented the shareholders, said it could take a long time to collect the damages, but argued that Russia would ultimately pay. \"Russia cares about being a powerful international player,\" he said. \"They should respect the rules of the game and I think they will.\" Rosneft rejected claims that any claims would be brought against it, arguing that the rulings would have \"no adverse effect on its business or assets\". The claim, brought under the energy charter treaty in 2005, amounted to less than the $100bn that claimants had originally hoped for, but is 20 times larger than the previous largest damages award against a government. Russia has 180 days to pay the $50bn bill, plus $65m in legal fees and arbitration costs, before interest starts accumulating. David Clark, who was an adviser to the former foreign secretary Robin Cook, said that Putin appeared to be in little mood to yield to foreign pressure, but warned that the economic cost of confrontation was likely to be high. \"Putin's new doctrine of muscular nationalism increasingly points in the opposite direction to Russia's real economic interests.\"",

    "webTitle": "Karl Albrecht obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Karl Albrecht, who has died aged 94, was the co-founder with his younger brother Theo of Aldi, one of the world's most successful discount supermarket chains. Although the family had a reputation for being frugal and reclusive, Karl's fortune was estimated at more than \u00a312bn, which reportedly made him the wealthiest man in Germany. The brothers had served in the Wehrmacht during the second world war, but in different theatres. Karl fought in Russia; while Theo served in the Afrika Korps. Both were captured, but at the end of the war were quickly returned to Essen, the city where they had been born. There they found that their mother's small grocery store stood unscathed amid the ruins left by the Allied bombing of the severely battered Ruhr industrial region. It was a typical \"Auntie Emma shop\" as the Germans call them, opened by their mother, Anna, after their father, also Karl, a coalminer, had been incapacitated by emphysema. The two brothers used it as a base for a pared-down grocery business, selling the bare necessities for which there would always be demand while eliminating the waste associated with perishable foods. The wartime ruin of Germany forced frugality on the nation, but even as a recovery took hold, Germans remained thrifty. The Albrechts carried on saving their customers money, and more of them from all classes came to value their approach. B y 1950 they owned 15 stores in the Ruhr valley. Aldi is an acronym formed from \"Albrecht discount\" and price-cutting with minimal waste underpinned the brothers' success. They set out to undersell not only corner shops but also giant retailers, stocking only around 2,000 items compared with up to 40,000 offered by a typical supermarket. Bulk-buying from obscure suppliers helped them achieve their basic aim of selling at the lowest prices, and by 1960 Aldi had more than 300 stores in West Germany, still displaying items of stock in their original cardboard boxes, as they had done from the outset. However, the two brothers then fell out over the issue of whether to sell cigarettes. The budding empire was split, with Theo establishing \"Aldi north\", which sold tobacco, and Karl leading \"Aldi south\", which did not. Germany was therefore divided by an \"Aldi equator\" between the parallel companies and later they carved up much of the world on similar lines, accumulating nearly 10,000 stores between them. Curiously, Britain (with more than 400 stores) is part of Aldi south, which embraces southern Europe. Both companies built up large businesses in the US, Europe and Australia. German unification in 1990 further boosted the fortunes of the two companies: high unemployment and low wages in the former East Germany were just the kind of conditions in which Aldi had flourished in the first place, while the banking collapse and financial crisis of 2007-08 encouraged western customers to fight austerity by saving on groceries at the considerable expense of conventional supermarkets. Thus the dispute about tobacco sales did not prevent the two companies from flourishing in parallel, step by step. Both brothers retired from active management in their 70s, in 1993, handing over to their respective families and importing outside managers to help each unquoted Aldi company to carry on growing. Karl retired from his business altogether only in 2002. Throughout their lives the two remained resolutely private \u2013 neither man gave any interviews after the early 1950s \u2013 and that trait was set in stone after Theo was kidnapped and held for 17 days in 1971. He was released unharmed when a massive ransom was paid, after which both brothers turned their Ruhr valley homes into fortresses and adopted security precautions normally associated with heads of state. They shared the use of Karl's heavily protected, 18-hole private golf course in the Black Forest. The brothers took their thriftiness to extremes, requiring staff to use pencils down to the stubs and wearing their own suits to shiny relics. Each put his version of Aldi in the hands of a foundation run by family members and carefully chosen business associates. They resembled an amicably divorced couple who lived apart but remained in close touch. Karl's wife, Maria, died in 2013. He is survived by their children, Karl and Beata. \u2022 Karl Hans Albrecht, businessman, born 20 February 1920; died 7 July 2014",

Karl retired from his business altogether only in 2002.</p> <p>Throughout their lives the two remained resolutely private \u2013 neither man gave any interviews after the early 1950s \u2013 and that trait was set in stone after <a href=\"http://www.today-in-history.de/index.php?what=thmanu&amp;manu_id=1660&amp;tag=29&amp;monat=11&amp;year=2012&amp;dayisset=1&amp;lang=en\" title=\"\">Theo was kidnapped and held</a> for 17 days in 1971. He was released unharmed when a massive ransom was paid, after which both brothers turned their Ruhr valley homes into fortresses and adopted security precautions normally associated with heads of state. They shared the use of Karl's heavily protected, 18-hole private golf course in the Black Forest.</p> <p>The brothers took their thriftiness to extremes, requiring staff to use pencils down to the stubs and wearing their own suits to shiny relics. Each put his version of Aldi in the hands of a foundation run by family members and carefully chosen business associates. They resembled an amicably divorced couple who lived apart but remained in close touch.</p> <p>Karl's wife, Maria, died in 2013. He is survived by their children, Karl and Beata.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Karl Hans Albrecht, businessman, born 20 February 1920; died 7 July 2014</p>",

We believe Matt Smith had designs on a larger role within Mothercare which might not have materialised under new chief executive Mark Newton-Jones. Matt Smith may also have left as, we believe, Mothercare group requires a \u00a360m-\u00a390m rights issue (rebasing, writing off of share options) to cover the costs of closing more UK high street stores and paying down its \u00a3100m of banking facilities before this October. <br> Furthermore, the Destination Maternity bid for Mothercare has finally ended with the US company stating last Friday afternoon that it is 'withdrawing its proposal for a possible combination with Mothercare'. However, we view any bid for Mothercare as a significant risk due to the substantial goodwill right-off against a balance sheet that has only \u00a315m of net assets or excluding ELC International goodwill (\u00a326.8m) and trade name goodwill (around \u00a37m) negative net assets of around \u00a320m.  More interestingly, we believe if Destination Maternity had been permitted to do due diligence on the Mothercare group of companies maybe it might have bid less, not more. While the list of issues around the around \u00a320m loss making UK Mothercare operations we believe are worth reiterating; very low store sales densities, lack of branded clothes, limited penetration in clothing for older children, low gross margin in baby equipment, high rental costs, lack of cash to exit leases early and a falling gross margin due to a reduction in buying power with suppliers, we also believe there is limited growth potential in International. This is important as the majority of the current Mothercare valuation is based on International profits. We know sales per International Franchisee have been falling and so has the International operating margin as either franchisee fee terms have been reset or economies of scale have reduced. In addition, the strength of sterling and decrease in franchisee sales of Mothercare product should indicate to investors that the International operations are unlikely to produce higher profits going forward. Furthermore, the International operations are spread over 60 countries but the sales are concentrated in a few markets in the Middle East and Russia both of which are facing more competition from rival baby brands.  The risk now is that the new management's recovery plan requires more capital and a reduction of debt hence the need to reconsider a deeply discounted rights issue or a joint venture deal on ELC to take the \u00a38m loss making operations off the balance sheet and profit and loss. We maintain our sell recommendation and target price of 114p as without a bid and finance director, Matt Smith, there is in our view a lot more 'gloss' to come off the shares. </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer goods giant that makes Nurofen and Dettol, plans to spin off its US-based pharmaceutical business. The FTSE 100 firm has announced that RB Pharmaceuticals will be floated on the London stock exchange as a standalone company. RBP, based in the US state of Virginia, generates nearly all its revenues from Suboxone, a heroin addiction treatment, but revenues have been shrinking as cheaper generic copies have come onto the market. Analysts have valued RBP at up to \u00a32.9bn or \u00a34 a share, but say that information gaps prevent them from getting the full picture. Reckitt Benckiser's chief executive Rakesh Kapoor has been keen to focus the company on its 19 \"powerbrands\", which include Durex condoms and Finish dishwasher tablets. The spin-off of the \"non core\" RBP business was flagged last October when the company announced a strategic review of the shrinking unit. The business once accounted for around one fifth of Reckitt Benckiser's profits, but takings have dived since Suboxone lost its US patent protection. Kapoor said he expected the listing of RBP to take place over the next 12 months, allowing the rest of the company \"to focus on its core strategy to be a global leader in consumer health and hygiene\". The decision to spin off the pharmaceuticals division, which now accounts for 7% of revenues, came as the company announced a 4% rise in like-for-like sales in the first half of 2014, excluding the Suboxone business. Profits have risen 16% to just over \u00a31bn. The change at Reckitt Benckiser comes as GlaxoSmithKline, the UK's largest pharmaceutical company, signalled a possible spin-off of its consumer health division, a \u00a36bn business that includes Panadol painkillers and Corsodyl mouthwash. Sir Andrew Witty, GSK's chief executive, said he was open to the idea, although stressed it was not likely in the short-term. In an interview with the Financial Times he said GSK had the option to spin off its consumer healthcare business if a time came when it offered more value as a standalone company. But he also made a case for keeping the consumer business attached to the broader group because of links between pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter drugs, particularly in emerging markets where categories are less clear cut. GSK has been embroiled in a corruption scandal in China that has seen its former head of operations in the country charged with bribery. Witty repeated previous statements that the company had a zero-tolerance approach to wrong-doing, suggesting that whistle-blowing was a common feature of the industry. \"Any company that doesn't get whistleblower letters isn't looking hard enough... If you are not getting anything: don't dream. It can't be perfect 100 per cent of the time.\"",

Sheila Coleman, Unite's coordinator of community branches in the north-west, said that \"the IFB does not impact positively on our community.\"</p> <p>Osborne has promised funding for a sequel in the form of the IFB 2016 which will allow businessmen to build relationships which were established in 2014. The official evaluation of the success of the festival is due this autumn but already Steinberg has vowed that the IBF is far from over. \"In 2016 we will put on an even bigger and better show\".</p>",

Promising to create 408 direct jobs, Peel's plan for Liverpool 2 is colossal. Ian Pollitt, development and investment surveyor at Peel, gestures out of his window at the sprawling project. His courting of Chinese investors begins with a private helicopter from John Lennon Airport \u2013 owned by the Peel Group \u2013 followed by a sweeping flight over the Mersey allowing their guests to take in the impressive scope of land and river, and finally a smooth landing in Liverpool Waters. He hopes it's an investment offer they can't refuse. But elsewhere in Liverpool there is unease. Those who run the Unite trade union community branch from the Casa bar in Liverpool's Georgian quarter wonder how a Labour council can be assisting the event. Dave Jacques refers to a \"chasm in the philosophy\" between the IFB organisers and the \"real people of Liverpool\". Sheila Coleman, Unite's coordinator of community branches in the north-west, said that \"the IFB does not impact positively on our community.\" Osborne has promised funding for a sequel in the form of the IFB 2016 which will allow businessmen to build relationships which were established in 2014. The official evaluation of the success of the festival is due this autumn but already Steinberg has vowed that the IBF is far from over. \"In 2016 we will put on an even bigger and better show\".",
