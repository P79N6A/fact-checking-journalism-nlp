      "bodyText": "The Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster has conceded there are big uncertainties in its predictions for higher tax revenues after the chancellor used the prospective windfall to justify a softer pace of cuts in his autumn statement. The Office for Budget Responsibility said it now expects more money to flow into government coffers from income taxes, corporation tax and VAT than it did at the time of its last forecasts, at George Osborne\u2019s summer budget four months ago. The OBR also expects the government to gain some fiscal headroom thanks to lower interest payments on its debts. Together, the higher tax revenue and lower interest payments amounted to a \u00a327bn improvement in the public finances compared with July\u2019s budget, Osborne said as he presented his autumn statement to parliament. The windfall allowed the chancellor to rewrite his spending review for the next four years, junking highly controversial plans to scrap tax credits and avoiding further police cuts as well as easing some of the spending cuts across government. Nevertheless, specific cuts announced on Wednesday included: An end to grants for student nurses, who must now pay for their own training with the help of loans. The cap on recruitment of student nurses will be lifted. Higher student loan repayments for people who have graduated since 2012 and will have to pay about \u00a3300 a year more. A \u00a315m boost for women\u2019s charities to be paid from the so-called tampon tax \u2013 the VAT levied on sanitary products. A cap on housing benefit rates in the social housing sector, limiting them to the same rate as private-sector housing benefit rates. A 19% cut in state funding for opposition parties. An overhaul of schools funding to even out regional variations and cuts to the further education budget that will mean funding per student for 16- to 19-year-olds in sixth forms and colleges is cut by 9.4% by 2020. The OBR\u2019s more optimistic outlook for tax receipts came as it left its forecast for UK GDP growth this year at 2.4% while cutting its forecast for global growth this year and next. It now sees the economy growing 2.4% next year and 2.5% in 2017, compared with July forecasts for 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. \u201cThe outlook for the economy has not changed a great deal since our last forecast in July,\u201d said OBR chairman Robert Chote. \u201cBut there have been somewhat bigger changes to the outlook for the public finances. The underlying fiscal position looks somewhat stronger over the medium term than it did in July.\u201d With the new forecasts, Osborne appeared able to row back on his planned tax credit cuts while also easing the scale of expected cuts on government departments\u2019 budgets, all while sticking to his target to run a budget surplus by the end of the decade. The OBR forecast a surplus of \u00a310.1bn in 2019-20, up marginally from July\u2019s forecast of \u00a310bn. But Chote conceded that forecasts for tax revenues were always vulnerable to a degree of uncertainty and in areas such as tax avoidance crackdowns the prospective windfalls were particularly hard to predict. Asked how confident the public could be in the OBR\u2019s forecasts for higher tax revenues, Chote emphasised that they were based on the mid-point from a range of likely paths. \u201cThere is a 50% chance they [tax receipts] will be higher and a 50% chance they will be lower, by definition,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are \u2026 particular uncertainties that arise out of the underlying forecast and there are uncertainties about how the latest sets of policy measures are going to affect those \u2026 There is enormous uncertainty around these things, but our best judgment is that the uncertainties are equally distributed above and below.\u201d Based on the OBR\u2019s latest analysis, Chote\u2019s team expect extra revenue for the exchequer of \u00a32.5bn this year, \u00a34.1bn next year, \u00a36.3bn in 2017-18 and \u00a35.4bn in the year after that. Explaining the rosier picture, Chote said \u201cincome tax and corporation taxes have come in stronger than we expected, which pushes through the forecast\u201d. In addition, the OBR had made significant changes to the way it models VAT deductions and national insurance contributions. Those changes boost receipts by more than \u00a36bn by the tax year 2020-21. Against the backdrop of a slowdown in the global economy and after the latest official figures showed the worst October for the public finances in six years, many economists remained sceptical that tax receipts would pick up as fast as the OBR predicted. Samuel Tombs, at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Osborne was \u201cdealt a kind hand\u201d by the OBR, adding: \u201cThe OBR is still too upbeat on austerity\u2019s impact on GDP, tax avoidance revenues and the interest bill.\u201d Similarly, Allan Monks, economist at JPMorgan, described the OBR\u2019s latest outlook as \u201can early Christmas present\u201d for the chancellor. \u201cOne risk is that tax revenues fall short of the OBR\u2019s expectations \u2013 we note the recent shortfall in government receipts so far this year \u2013 or that growth undershoots the OBR\u2019s projections next year,\u201d said Monks. Howard Archer, at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said it was \u201cquestionable\u201d whether the UK economy could grow as fast as the OBR forecasts. \u201cThere are obviously major uncertainties to the outlook, not least the potential economic impact of the forthcoming referendum on UK membership of the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chancellor announced that Britain \u2018now has a permanent pothole fund\u2019 and it is difficult not to wonder how many potholes George Osborne is likely to come across over the coming years as he looks to achieve a surplus of \u00a310.1bn in 2019/20.\u201d The OBR stuck to an earlier forecast that employment growth would ease off as productivity picks up. But it also trimmed its outlook for wage growth after the chancellor announced a levy on employers to help fund apprenticeships. Chote said: \u201cThe apprenticeship levy behaves like a payroll tax, so we assume that the costs are passed on into lower profits and \u2013 primarily \u2013 lower wages ... Bear in mind that this comes on top of the higher minimum wage and auto-enrolment into pension saving, which also increase business costs.\u201d Despite the slower-than-expected pace of spending cuts, some economists noted that the overall picture was still one of tightening. Martin Beck, of the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: \u201cA stronger revenue forecast gave the chancellor room to scrap plans to cut tax credits next April and modestly increase overall government spending. That said, the autumn statement\u2019s modest net \u2018giveaway\u2019 next year will be quickly eroded by tax rises. And the spending review confirmed that the economy faces a serious fiscal squeeze over the next few years.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has pulled off what should have been impossible: he cancelled his tax credit changes in full, softened the sharpest edges of Whitehall budget cuts and still left himself a \u00a310bn pre-election warchest by 2020. Speculation had been rife about whose pockets the chancellor would pick in order to pay for the well-signalled U-turn on tax credits. But in the event, Osborne was handed an extraordinary \u00a327bn get-out-of-jail-free card by Robert Chote, the director of the Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR, which was set up by Osborne when he came to power to take the knotty job of economic forecasting out of the hands of the Treasury, has recently been taking a close look at the way it forecasts tax revenues. As a result it has made a raft of changes affecting everything from the way it accounts for VAT deductions to predictions of how much national insurance the government is likely to collect. In total, the OBR now expects tax revenues to be more than \u00a34bn higher in 2016-17 than it thought four months ago, \u00a36.3bn higher in 2017-18 and \u00a35.4bn more in 2018-19. Chote and his colleagues also predict that the government will have to pay \u00a317bn less interest on its \u00a31.6tn debt pile over the course of the parliament than they thought in July, for two reasons. First, the OBR now thinks interest rates will remain on hold until at least 2017, despite the Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s suggestion that the decision will come into focus at the turn of the year. And second, the Bank has signalled that it plans to hang on to the \u00a3375bn of government bonds, or gilts, that it bought under the quantitative easing programme, until it has raised interest rates significantly. That should help to keep the price of gilts relatively high, and since yields, or interest rates, move in the opposite direction, it should make it cheaper for the government to fund its debt. Forecasting the public finances is notoriously difficult, and Chote was clear that there was every chance the new predictions, too, would prove inaccurate. But between them, these changes created \u00a327bn of wriggle room for the chancellor over the next five years, and he chose to exploit it to the full. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cIf the OBR has a better sense of where revenues are coming from, then we should go with that; but it does highlight the fact that all these predictions are highly uncertain, and there\u2019s an element of risk in taking that money and spending it.\u201d Part of the virtual windfall will be spent on cancelling the tax credit cuts, which were due to save more than \u00a34bn a year. But the chancellor also chose to moderate the path of Whitehall spending cuts, just as Tory backbenchers were becoming restive about the potential impact in their constituencies. Indeed, Osborne will more than use the extra leeway created by the OBR, spending \u00a36.2bn more next year than he expected in July, so that borrowing is moderately higher than expected in the short run. Many of the cumulative cuts in departments\u2019 resource budgets \u2013 their day-to-day spending \u2013 over the next five years, while deep, were well below the 25-40% they had been told to plan for. Capital spending, on longer-term investment plans, has been protected or in some cases increased, allowing the chancellor to repeat his boast that \u201cwe are the builders\u201d, and he enumerated a series of pet projects, from improvements on the M1 to the HS2 rail link. And towards the end of the parliament, the chancellor has opted to raid new sources of revenue to complete his plan to shift Britain \u201cfrom the red into the black\u201d. Buy-to-let landlords and purchasers of second homes will have to pay a hefty 3% stamp duty on new property purchases. That will raise \u00a31bn a year by 2020, and chimes with concerns expressed recently by the Bank of England that the rapid growth in buy-to-let lending could eventually endanger financial stability. Big businesses are another less-than-cherished group in line to fund that pre-election warchest. The new apprenticeship levy, first announced in July, will raise a larger-than-expected \u00a33bn a year by the middle of this parliament. The OBR expects firms to respond by lowering wages for their workforce to meet the costs, but staff are more likely to blame their employer than the chancellor for that. Council taxpayers will find themselves on the hook for two of the Treasury\u2019s most pressing challenges: how to protect the police from deep cuts, and how to fund social care for an ageing population. Local councils will in future be able to levy a precept - a supplement on council tax bills - to pay for either of these political hot potatoes. The Treasury traditionally hates so-called \u201chypothecated\u201d taxes \u2013 those earmarked for a particular job. But as spending cuts bite, it has become increasingly appealing to see off protests in particular areas with specially designated chunks of money. As a result, the OBR expects higher council tax revenues to be bringing in up to \u00a32bn extra by 2020 \u2013 though councils complain that it will be easier to raise the extra cash in areas where property prices and household incomes are high. Sharon Taylor, deputy chair of the Local Government Association, said: \u201cWealthier areas could benefit more because they collect more of their budgets through council tax and are less reliant on government funding. More deprived areas could then be hit doubly hard because they will be have to cope with deep government funding cuts while being unable to use council tax raising powers without dragging low-income families into financial difficulty.\u201d With the OBR\u2019s help, and a few carefully targeted tax increases, Osborne used Wednesday\u2019s statement to fill in many of the political holes he dug for himself in the summer. But much could still go wrong for this lucky chancellor. Even his new, gentler austerity plan still involves trimming \u00a312bn off the welfare bill, albeit more slowly than previously planned, and \u00a312bn a year from departmental budgets already hard hit in the last parliament. And as the OBR has graphically demonstrated, public finance forecasts are barely worth the hundreds of pages they\u2019re written on.",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne has pulled off what should have been impossible: he cancelled his tax credit changes in full, softened the sharpest edges of Whitehall budget cuts and still left himself a \u00a310bn pre-election warchest by 2020.</p> <p>Speculation had been rife about whose pockets the chancellor would pick in order to pay for the well-signalled U-turn on tax credits. But in the event, Osborne was handed an extraordinary \u00a327bn get-out-of-jail-free card by Robert Chote, the director of the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p> <p>The OBR, which was set up by Osborne when he came to power to take the knotty job of economic forecasting out of the hands of the Treasury, has recently been taking a close look at the way it forecasts tax revenues.</p> <p>As a result it has made a raft of changes affecting everything from the way it accounts for VAT deductions to predictions of how much national insurance the government is likely to collect. </p> <p>In total, the OBR now expects tax revenues to be more than \u00a34bn higher in 2016-17 than it thought four months ago, \u00a36.3bn higher in 2017-18 and \u00a35.4bn more in 2018-19.</p> <p>Chote and his colleagues also predict that the government will have to pay \u00a317bn less interest on its \u00a31.6tn debt pile over the course of the parliament than they thought in July, for two reasons.</p> <p>First, the OBR now thinks interest rates will remain on hold until at least 2017, despite the Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s suggestion that the decision will come into focus at the turn of the year.</p> <p>And second, the Bank has signalled that it plans to hang on to the \u00a3375bn of government bonds, or gilts, that it bought under the quantitative easing programme, until it has raised interest rates significantly. That should help to keep the price of gilts relatively high, and since yields, or interest rates, move in the opposite direction, it should make it cheaper for the government to fund its debt.</p> <p>Forecasting the public finances is notoriously difficult, and Chote was clear that there was every chance the new predictions, too, would prove inaccurate. But between them, these changes created \u00a327bn of wriggle room for the chancellor over the next five years, and he chose to exploit it to the full.<br></p> <p>Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cIf the OBR has a better sense of where revenues are coming from, then we should go with that; but it does highlight the fact that all these predictions are highly uncertain, and there\u2019s an element of risk in taking that money and spending it.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the virtual windfall will be spent on cancelling the tax credit cuts, which were due to save more than \u00a34bn a year. But the chancellor also chose to moderate the path of Whitehall spending cuts, just as Tory backbenchers were becoming restive about the potential impact in their constituencies.</p> <p>Indeed, Osborne will more than use the extra leeway created by the OBR, spending \u00a36.2bn more next year than he expected in July, so that borrowing is moderately higher than expected in the short run.</p> <p>Many of the cumulative cuts in departments\u2019 resource budgets \u2013 their day-to-day spending \u2013 over the next five years, while deep, were well below the 25-40% they had been told to plan for.</p> <p>Capital spending, on longer-term investment plans, has been protected or in some cases increased, allowing the chancellor to repeat his boast that \u201cwe are the builders\u201d, and he enumerated a series of pet projects, from improvements on the M1 to the HS2 rail link.</p> <p>And towards the end of the parliament, the chancellor has opted to raid new sources of revenue to complete his plan to shift Britain \u201cfrom the red into the black\u201d.</p> <p>Buy-to-let landlords and purchasers of second homes will have to pay a hefty 3% stamp duty on new property purchases. That will raise \u00a31bn a year by 2020, and chimes with concerns expressed recently by the Bank of England that the rapid growth in buy-to-let lending could eventually endanger financial stability.</p> <p>Big businesses are another less-than-cherished group in line to fund that pre-election warchest. The new apprenticeship levy, first announced in July, will raise a larger-than-expected \u00a33bn a year by the middle of this parliament. The OBR expects firms to respond by lowering wages for their workforce to meet the costs, but staff are more likely to blame their employer than the chancellor for that.</p> <p>Council taxpayers will find themselves on the hook for two of the Treasury\u2019s most pressing challenges: how to protect the police from deep cuts, and how to fund social care for an ageing population. Local councils will in future be able to levy a precept - a supplement on council tax bills - to pay for either of these political hot potatoes.</p> <p>The Treasury traditionally hates so-called \u201chypothecated\u201d taxes \u2013 those earmarked for a particular job. But as spending cuts bite, it has become increasingly appealing to see off protests in particular areas with specially designated chunks of money. </p> <p>As a result, the OBR expects higher council tax revenues to be bringing in up to \u00a32bn extra by 2020 \u2013 though councils complain that it will be easier to raise the extra cash in areas where property prices and household incomes are high.<br></p> <p>Sharon Taylor, deputy chair of the Local Government Association, said: \u201cWealthier areas could benefit more because they collect more of their budgets through council tax and are less reliant on government funding. More deprived areas could then be hit doubly hard because they will be have to cope with deep government funding cuts while being unable to use council tax raising powers without dragging low-income families into financial difficulty.\u201d</p> <p>With the OBR\u2019s help, and a few carefully targeted tax increases, Osborne used Wednesday\u2019s statement to fill in many of the political holes he dug for himself in the summer.</p> <p>But much could still go wrong for this lucky chancellor. Even his new, gentler austerity plan still involves trimming \u00a312bn off the welfare bill, albeit more slowly than previously planned, and \u00a312bn a year from departmental budgets already hard hit in the last parliament. </p> <p>And as the OBR has graphically demonstrated, public finance forecasts are barely worth the hundreds of pages they\u2019re written on. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Green groups and charities have reacted with anger after the government announced cuts to the UK\u2019s most important energy-efficiency programme, which was created to help the poorest homeowners. The move by George Osborne significantly reduces a requirement for energy companies to install new boilers and insulation. The chancellor said it would help cut homeowners\u2019 gas and electricity bills by \u00a330 a year. The changes affect the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) scheme, which is paid for by the big six energy firms and adds around \u00a347 a year to the average gas and electricity bill, which is \u00a31,100 a year. The money is spent on making the housing stock more energy efficient by installing loft and cavity wall insulation. It also helps people on the lowest incomes replace old and inefficient boilers. The scheme almost exclusively benefits those on the lowest incomes, according to campaigners, who say the recipients tend to live in the worst housing stock and would not be able to afford the improvements themselves. Charities and green groups reacted with dismay to the news., They labelled it the latest anti-environment move from a government that originally promised to be the greenest ever. The decision comes on top of planned cuts to solar subsidies scheduled for January, and was announced days before ministers will attend the UN climate change talks in Paris. The ECO scheme has long attracted criticism from the big power companies. They claimed it puts them at a disadvantage to smaller rivals that are not required to take part. It has also drawn the ire of the rightwing press, which has repeatedly attacked the imposition of what have been termed green taxes. George Osborne said ECO will replaced from April 2017 with a cheaper domestic energy efficiency supplier obligation, which will run for five years. \u201cThe new scheme will upgrade the energy efficiency of over 200,000 homes per year, saving those homes up to \u00a3300 off their annual energy bill, tackling the root cause of fuel poverty and delivering on the government\u2019s commitment to help 1m more homes this parliament,\u201d he said. Eco is thought to raise around \u00a31.1bn a year, but this could be cut to around \u00a3400m a year under the new, lower-cost option, proposed by Osborne. On Wednesday morning the Office for National Statistics said there were almost 44,000 excess winter deaths in England and Wales last year, a 15-year year high and 151% higher than the year before. Poor-quality heating is thought to play a big part in such deaths, although it is not the only factor. The shadow energy secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary that the chancellor has announced huge cuts to home insulation on the very same day we discovered that thousands of people died last winter because of the scandal of cold homes. By slashing investment in energy efficiency yet again millions of families will be left paying more for their energy bills and people will suffer.\u201d Friends of the Earth described the cuts as \u201cyet another blow to government credibility on tackling high energy bills\u201d. Peter Smith, from fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said the move was shortsighted. He added: \u201cEnergy efficiency can reduce energy bills and keep vulnerable people out of hospital. This decision could lead to the NHS having to spend in excess of \u00a322bn to treat cold-related illnesses over the next 15 years.\u201d Julie Hirigoyen, the UK Green Building Council\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe chancellor was keen to emphasise the government\u2019s green credentials ahead of Paris, but they are going backwards on one of the most cost-effective opportunities \u2013 improving the energy efficiency of our existing housing stock.\u201d Osborne also confirmed that the Renewable Heat Incentive, which helps those off the national grid invest in green heating measures, is also being cut by \u00a3700m. Green groups had feared the scheme, which suffered a series of delays, could have been suffered the same fate as feed-in-tariffs, which have supported the growth of solar power. The solar industry is braced for significant cuts in January to feed-in-tariffs, which have encouraged thousands of householders to install electricity generating panels on their roofs. Several big solar firms have already ceased trading and more are expected to follow. According to the Treasury, when the ECO changes are taken into account, the entire package of energy measures will save householders a total of \u00a335 a year by 2020.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s past deep cuts in the rate of corporation tax are forgotten. Big business was almost united in hating the chancellor\u2019s new tax-raising measure \u2013 the apprenticeship levy. The rate was set higher than expected, at 0.5% of an employer\u2019s payroll, and will apply to companies with an annual wage bill of more than \u00a33m. It will raise almost \u00a33bn a year from 2017, or \u00a312bn over this parliament, which is serious money. Large companies are hardwired to grumble about any new payroll tax and, under normal circumstances, outside sympathy would be limited. The UK, as even big business recognises, needs to improve its productivity and competitiveness, and a Tory chancellor can\u2019t be blamed for wanting to force investment in training that isn\u2019t currently happening. Some 3 million apprentices by 2020, compared with 2.4 million in the previous parliament, sounds a reasonable aim. Yet one detail sets alarms ringing. The Institute of Directors (IoD) claimed it had been told the government was working on the assumption that up to a quarter of the money collected would be spent on administration. The explanation, apparently, is that a new IT system needs to be built. If that figure for bureaucracy is even approximately correct, the IoD is right to question how businesses are supposed to get more out of a levy than they put in, which is Osborne\u2019s boast. Too much cash would be leaking out of the scheme. The Department for Business says it does not recognise the IoD\u2019s figure. Good, but what\u2019s the real number? If big business is to be persuaded to embrace the levy, there will have to be a clear answer. Time to get real about housebuilding The chancellor\u2019s housebuilding ambitions grow bolder. The latest pledge is 400,000 affordable new homes by the end of the decade under \u201cthe biggest housebuilding programme since the 1970s\u201d. Believe it when you see it. Even housebuilders \u2013 the supposed indirect beneficiaries of the doubling of the housing budget \u2013 are sceptical about the 400,000 target, which implies a step-up of about 40% from current rates of construction. There are at least two related problems. First, the shortage of skilled labour. One specialist recruiter, Randstad CPE, reckons the UK needs to train an extra 30,000 quantity surveyors and 61,000 project managers to achieve the target. Positively minded chief executives take the view that extra investment and training will follow when all branches of government are sufficiently clear in their intentions. But that\u2019s where the second problem kicks in: do local authorities share Osborne\u2019s enthusiasm for meeting half the 400,000 target with so-called starter homes that are available to buy rather than to rent? Local authorities may prefer to stick with what they know \u2013 rentable units \u2013 to meet their statutory obligations to supply affordable housing. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily think starter homes are a bad thing, but not all are convinced they are a good thing,\u201d said one housebuilding boss. Indeed, the housebuilders have questions of their own. Starter homes will be sold at 20% below market value to first-time buyers, raising the question of how market values are calculated, at what point in the construction cycle. All these problems can be solved, but probably not overnight. One suspects 200,000 extra new homes by the end of the decade would be more realistic. Help to buy \u2013 and buy and buy \u201cWe\u2019ve been very explicit that this scheme is limited to three years,\u201d said Danny Alexander, the then Treasury minister, when help to buy, the other half of Osborne\u2019s plan to invigorate the housing market, was introduced in 2013. Yeah, right. The scheme was launched as a temporary remedy to address a supposed shortfall in the mortgage market. It has since become a government addiction, just as critics feared it would. Help to buy has been extended to the end of this parliament and is spawning children. Londoners with a 5% deposit can get an interest-free loan to cover 40% of the value of a newly built home. A related share ownership has had many of its restrictions lifted. This is supercharged government intervention in the demand side of the housing market. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let this scheme turn into a permanent scheme,\u201d warned Mervyn King, then governor of the Bank of England, back in 2013. It looks like we just have.",

It will raise almost \u00a33bn a year from 2017, or \u00a312bn over this parliament, which is serious money.</p> <p>Large companies are hardwired to grumble about any new payroll tax and, under normal circumstances, outside sympathy would be limited. The UK, as even big business recognises, needs to improve its productivity and competitiveness, and a Tory chancellor can\u2019t be blamed for wanting to force investment in training that isn\u2019t currently happening. Some 3 million apprentices by 2020, compared with 2.4 million in the previous parliament, sounds a reasonable aim.</p> <p>Yet one detail sets alarms ringing. The Institute of Directors (IoD) claimed it had been told the government was working on the assumption that up to a quarter of the money collected would be spent on administration. The explanation, apparently, is that a new IT system needs to be built.</p> <p>If that figure for bureaucracy is even approximately correct, the IoD is right to question how businesses are supposed to get more out of a levy than they put in, which is Osborne\u2019s boast. Too much cash would be leaking out of the scheme.</p> <p>The Department for Business says it does not recognise the IoD\u2019s figure. Good, but what\u2019s the real number? If big business is to be persuaded to embrace the levy, there will have to be a clear answer.</p> <h2>Time to get real about housebuilding</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9a8b8cfef145f6b53c963024e13d3e636d3b512\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9a8b8cfef145f6b53c963024e13d3e636d3b512/0_407_6496_3900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newly constructed family homes for sale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newly constructed family homes for sale.

The latest pledge is 400,000 affordable new homes by the end of the decade under \u201cthe biggest housebuilding programme since the 1970s\u201d. Believe it when you see it. Even housebuilders \u2013 the supposed indirect beneficiaries of the doubling of the housing budget \u2013 are sceptical about the 400,000 target, which implies a step-up of about 40% from current rates of construction.<br></p> <p>There are at least two related problems. First, the shortage of skilled labour. One specialist recruiter, Randstad CPE, reckons the UK needs to train an extra 30,000 quantity surveyors and 61,000 project managers to achieve the target.</p> <p>Positively minded chief executives take the view that extra investment and training will follow when all branches of government are sufficiently clear in their intentions. But that\u2019s where the second problem kicks in: do local authorities share Osborne\u2019s enthusiasm for meeting half the 400,000 target with so-called starter homes that are available to buy rather than to rent?</p> <p>Local authorities may prefer to stick with what they know \u2013 rentable units \u2013 to meet their statutory obligations to supply affordable housing. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily think starter homes are a bad thing, but not all are convinced they are a good thing,\u201d said one housebuilding boss.</p> <p>Indeed, the housebuilders have questions of their own. Starter homes will be sold at 20% below market value to first-time buyers, raising the question of how market values are calculated, at what point in the construction cycle. All these problems can be solved, but probably not overnight. One suspects 200,000 extra new homes by the end of the decade would be more realistic.</p> <h2>Help to buy \u2013 and buy and buy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fed7e50732cf35fc8639663445389c9994b694f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fed7e50732cf35fc8639663445389c9994b694f2/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Critics continue to question key aspects of the help to buy scheme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Critics continue to question key aspects of the help to buy scheme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been very explicit that this scheme is limited to three years,\u201d said Danny Alexander, the then Treasury minister, when help to buy, the other half of Osborne\u2019s plan to invigorate the housing market, was introduced in 2013. Yeah, right.</p> <p>The scheme was launched as a temporary remedy to address a supposed shortfall in the mortgage market. It has since become a government addiction, just as critics feared it would. Help to buy has been extended to the end of this parliament and is spawning children. Londoners with a 5% deposit can get an interest-free loan to cover 40% of the value of a newly built home. A related share ownership has had many of its restrictions lifted. This is supercharged government intervention in the demand side of the housing market.</p> <p>\u201cWe mustn\u2019t let this scheme turn into a permanent scheme,\u201d warned Mervyn King, then governor of the Bank of England, back in 2013. It looks like we just have.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Buy-to-let landlords and second-home buyers face a big jump in stamp duty under plans designed to ease the path to home ownership for first-time buyers. Experts said the new measures would deter landlords from buying up properties, but could also \u201cturbo-charge\u201d house prices in the short term as, investors race to complete sales before the higher tax \u2013 on all properties more than \u00a3400,000 \u2013 comes into force next April. George Osborne announced a clampdown on purchases of buy-to-let and holiday properties as part of a spending review package to tackle \u201ca growing crisis of home ownership in our country\u201d. He said: \u201c15 years ago, around 60% of people under 35 owned their own home, next year it\u2019s set to be just half of that.\u201d Announcing the measures, the chancellor said he was setting out a \u201cbold plan to back families who aspire to buy their own home\u201d, amid a property boom that has seen the average UK house price rise by 6% in the year to September, to \u00a3286,000. As well as the new higher rate of stamp duty, the announcements designed to help would-be homebuyers include: The help-to-buy interest-free loan scheme will be boosted for homebuyers in London. They will be able to borrow double the current \u00a320,000 allowed under the current scheme. 135,000 new affordable shared ownership homes to be built for buyers earning up to \u00a380,000 outside London and \u00a390,000 in London. Public-sector land with capacity for 160,000 homes will be released The stamp duty changes mean that from April 2016, anyone buying any kind of property alongside their main home will pay a 3 percentage-point premium. The move, which will add more than \u00a310,000 to the upfront costs typically faced by landlords in London, is the latest in a series of moves designed to make investment in property less attractive. The chancellor said: \u201c[The change] addresses the fact that more and more homes are being bought as buy-to-lets or second homes. Many of them are cash purchases that aren\u2019t affected by the restrictions I introduced in the budget on mortgage interest relief; and many of them are bought by those who aren\u2019t residents in this country.\u201d He said that by 2021 the policy would raise almost \u00a31bn a year, and \u00a360m of this money would be reinvested \u201cin local communities in London and places like Cornwall, which are being priced out of home ownership\u201d. However, experts warned that in the short term it could lead to a flurry of purchases and higher prices. Under the new rules, buyers of second homes will face a 3 percentage-point surcharge on normal stamp duty bills. While owner occupiers buying property do not pay any tax on purchases costing up to \u00a3125,000, second-home buyers will face a 3% bill. As each new tier of stamp duty kicks in, at \u00a3250,001, \u00a3925,001 and \u00a31.5m, investors will pay the additional rate, until above the final threshold they will pay 15%. The average buy-to-let property cost \u00a3184,000 last year, and the change would mean a bill of \u00a36,700 instead of the current \u00a31,180. In London, where the typical price was \u00a3337,734, investors will pay \u00a317,018 to the taxman, compared with \u00a36,686 today. The changes follow an announcement in July\u2019s budget that buy-to-let landlords will face higher tax bills from 2017, when 40% relief on mortgage repayments starts to be phased out. Doug Crawford, head of conveyancing firm My Home Move, said: \u201cThe stamp duty changes will turbo-charge the housing market over the next four months as buy-to-let landlords and holiday home buyers race to beat the deadline before the changes bite in April. This will inevitably push up property prices in the short term, especially in locations popular with buy-to-let investors, such as London.\u201d Jonathan Adams, director of estate agency Napier Watt, said he expected both investors planning to buy and those wanting a second home to bring the decision forward and do so before April. \u201cIt is interesting that Osborne did not impose the extra tax straight away, as he did in last year\u2019s autumn statement, but he has given potential buyers a few months\u2019 grace,\u201d he said. \u201cThe unintended consequence is that this could push property prices up further in coming months \u2013 the opposite effect to that intended.\u201d Lucian Cook from property firm Savills said that in the long term buy-to-let investors were \u201clikely to display greater caution faced with higher transaction costs\u201d. He said: \u201cThese buyers have historically been particularly attracted to new-build housing. That means once the changes are introduced housebuilders will be less able to rely on this type of buyer and will have to focus more on demand for the shared ownership, starter homes and help-to-buy product that is supported by other government policy.\u201d Richard Lambert, the CEO of the National Landlords Association, accused the chancellor of wanting to \u201cchoke off\u201d future investment in private properties to rent. \u201cThe exemption for corporate investment makes this effectively an attack on the small private landlords who responded to the housing crisis by putting their own money into providing homes by the party that they put their faith in at the election,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s the chancellor\u2019s intention to completely eradicate buy-to-let in the UK then it\u2019s a mystery to us why he doesn\u2019t just come out and say so?\u201d he added. Under the new London help-to-buy scheme, homebuyers in the capital will be able to take out a mortgage for little more than half the cost of a property, after the government unveiled plans to offer interest-free loans worth up to 40% of the price. With the average cost of a home in the capital now nudging \u00a3500,000, some experts warned that even with the bigger loans on offer, many people would still be locked out of the market because of the requirement for a 5% deposit, which on that average price would work out at \u00a325,000. The original help-to-buy loan scheme programme allows homebuyers with just 5% of a property\u2019s price to buy a new-build home costing up to \u00a3600,000 with the help of an interest-free loan of up to 20% of the price. Detailed information on how London\u2019s scheme will work will not be released until early 2016, which is also when the scheme will take effect. Mark Hayward, managing director of the National Association of Estate Agents, said the London scheme was \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d for first-time buyers, though he added: \u201cA 5% deposit on the average price of a home in London is still not affordable enough.\u201d Stuart Law at Assetz for Investors, a buy-to-let estate agency, said the higher equity loans in London would \u201ccreate further upward price pressure\u201d in the capital. However, Adrian Anderson, the director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, said offering a 40% interest-free loan \u201cwill make a huge difference, enabling many to get on the housing ladder when they simply couldn\u2019t before\u201d. He gave the example of a one-bedroom flat in Camberwell, south London, which was on the market at \u00a3360,000. A 5% deposit works out at \u00a318,000, but if an individual did not buy via help-to-buy, they would need to raise a mortgage for the rest, which would require earnings of around \u00a385,000, thereby pricing out many buyers. Under London help-to-buy, a 40% interest-free loan would be available, leaving the individual needing a mortgage of \u00a3198,000. \u201cThis could be done with an income of \u00a350,000, which is much more achievable in the capital,\u201d said Anderson. In another addition to the help-to-buy scheme, the chancellor announced an extension of shared ownership in England, where buyers get on the housing ladder by purchasing a part-share in a property and renting the rest from a housing association.",

      "bodyText": "Benzi Ronen thinks supermarkets are on their way out. \u201cIt\u2019s the last remaining retail frontier that hasn\u2019t been disrupted by the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is going to be someone who cracks the nut.\u201d Ronen, founder and CEO of Farmigo, an online farmer\u2019s market that\u2019s trying to make local food access easier for both farmers and consumers, is a little biased. He has a vested interest in disrupting the traditional food chain. Farmigo, which operates in the Bay Area and around New York, just launched in Seattle, and it\u2019s not the only tech startup cutting into grocery stores\u2019 market share. The internet, and the mobile web in particular, is changing how we get food. On your phone, you can tap in takeout orders through Seamless or have your groceries delivered by FreshDirect. Well-known food writer Mark Bittman just joined the team at Purple Carrot, an online vegan meal kit delivery service. Ronen says he wants Farmigo, with which users can sign up for weekly grocery deliveries from a variety of local farms, to be the only middleman between farms and kitchens, and to cut waste and costs in the process. That sounds lofty \u2013 and other businesses have floundered in the process \u2013 but the impetus behind Farmigo and a lot of food tech startups is that there are inefficiencies in the industrial food system. Traditionally, to enable sales, stores make sure they have plenty of inventory on hand. That means customers can always find what they want, but farms only take home about 20% of the profit when they sell wholesale \u2013 and upwards of 40% of produce gets wasted (PDF). Also, the system was based on a static analysis of what was sold. There was no interface to cut down on waste or wasted time, nor was there much of a way to track what customers actually wanted. \u201cThe only place you could have done that before is at the farmers market,\u201d Ronen says. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t scale.\u201d To scale the system \u2013 to get people to break out of their normal shopping habits, and to convince farmers to change their sales strategy \u2013 there has to be a convenience factor on both ends. That\u2019s where the web-based platform, which allows growers to only harvest what the customer is going to buy, comes in \u2013 but it\u2019s still not easy to redesign the food chain. \u201cThe model that we\u2019re talking about creates a tremendous number of challenges,\u201d Rosen says. \u201cThere\u2019s an advantage to having inventory.\u201d Farmigo\u2019s model looks like this: the site hosts a Pinterest-like listing of what\u2019s available that week. Farms,bakeries or fishermen list what they have in stock, and customers can select what they want. The producer drops off at a warehouse the food that\u2019s been ordered. Then Farmigo\u2019s staff sorts the orders and the groceries are delivered, weekly, to a drop-off hub in the customer\u2019s neighborhood. The idea is that both consumers and producers know what they are getting, shoppers can hit more than one farm without leaving their homes and farmers won\u2019t have to deal with sales and marketing. But there are tricky parts to that. \u201cSo much of the success and challenges were around the logistics of coordinating orders from customers,\u201d says Alon Salant, co-founder and chief technology officer of Good Eggs, a similar San Francisco Bay-based organic food delivery service that\u2019s recently had to scale back and revamp its door-to-door delivery model. Shrinking the supply chain, for instance, can be problematic. Ronen says Farmigo tries to monitor it closely and be fully transparent, but because the company is dealing with nature, it can\u2019t always be completely accurate. \u201cWhat happens if we sell 500 head of broccoli and the farm was only able to harvest 400?\u201d he says. \u201cWe might have to short a customer or replace it with something from another farm.\u201d Part of the challenge with trying to bring local food systems online is they\u2019re local and specific to the community. \u201cOur product is highly differentiated in New York, but it might not be in [the] Bay Area, where the access to local food is phenomenal and your supermarket has a lot of local food,\u201d Ronen says. \u201cIn the Bay we promote the values that we\u2019re about, whereas in New York the food kind of sells itself because you can\u2019t get that stuff in the supermarket.\u201d The local aspect proved to be a problem for Good Eggs, which expanded into Los Angeles, New York and New Orleans in 2013, and then scaled back to just the San Francisco area in August. According to Salant, the company was testing its model, and the differences in the food available in different cities proved a stumbling point. It was hard to find nearby produce in the New York winter, for instance; in New Orleans, where the local food system is less established, a lot of the farms didn\u2019t have the insurance they required. Salant says Good Eggs is now focused on making its San Francisco operation more efficient. It has just released an app and is implementing next-day delivery. Ronen says he thinks part of Good Eggs\u2019 problem was the door-to-door delivery system, which adds another layer of labor. Farmigo delivers to neighborhood hubs like schools or individual\u2019s homes but that\u2019s not without problems, either. It can be tricky to find the right person to run the hub, because each is staffed by volunteers who get a discount on their groceries. Farmigo is somewhat dependent on the good will of the hub\u2019s host, another factor it\u2019s trying to smooth out. Also, Ronen says, there\u2019s no way the company could have done this even five years ago, because of the way that inventory management systems have changed and the fact that the technology powering them has become affordable. Nowadays, for example, farmers can know exactly how much of a specific crop to harvest, which can keep supplies and prices steady. Farmigo is also benefiting from the success of other players across the digital food world. Small-scale, online farmers markets, like New York\u2019s Quinciple, are growing, and meal kit companies like Purple Carrot and Blue Apron \u2013 which Ronen and Salant say act like training wheels for operations like theirs \u2013 are helping to disrupt consumer shopping habits. Ronen says that currently only 1.5% of Americans shop for their groceries online, but that\u2019s changing and there\u2019s huge room for growth, especially if companies can make it accessible and affordable for a bigger swath of people. Currently the typical online grocery consumer is urban and upper middle class, but Ronen and Salant say the model makes sense in both suburbs and food deserts because it doesn\u2019t require infrastructure. Ronen also says he wants to be able to accept food stamps, like many farmers markets do, to even out accessibility. But first, he\u2019s waiting to see how they do in a new urban setting. \u201cWe need to get consumers to replace their need to go to the supermarket,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we live or die by.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Finally, an admission from the chancellor that Britain\u2019s housing market is well and truly broken. Even a political party overflowing with estate agents, landlords and property developers knows the housing market is failing, not least because their own sons and daughters despair at affording a home. But grand promises of 400,000 new homes, a help-to-buy scheme in London, and a doubling in the housing budget may still not be enough to reverse the decade-long fall in home ownership, that central tenet of Conservative philosophy. No longer do rising house prices produce a feelgood factor among the voting population. Instead, there\u2019s the feelbad factor of generation rent, paying half or more of their income to their landlord. It may explain why in this autumn statement the chancellor has made a second assault against one of the more powerful bastions in his own party, buy-to-let landlords. In July\u2019s budget he whipped millions off landlords with new taxes coming into force in 2017. He will find a further \u00a31bn a year by making investors pay an extra 3% stamp duty on buy-to-lets and second homes. In real terms, this means that on a typical buy-to-let purchase of \u00a3184,000, the tax will rise from \u00a31,180 to \u00a36,700. The Association of Residential Letting Agents promptly called it \u201ccatastrophic\u201d while the National Association of Estate Agents said it would \u201cput a stop to those entering the sector\u201d. Telegraph readers will be in shock. The paper\u2019s \u201cAxe the buy-to-let tax grab\u201d campaign features \u201cpersecuted\u201d and \u201cdemonised\u201d landlords, despite the fact they have made fatter profits than any other group of investors this century. The boss of one big estate agency group, Ludlow Thompson said the chancellor is now treating the buy-to-let market \u201clike the tobacco industry\u201d. About time, first-time buyers will say. They have queued at new home launches, or grim \u201copen days\u201d, where they have been consistently outbid by the financial firepower of tax-advantaged buy-to-let landlords. Hitting landlords and second-home buyers should provoke a welcome reduction in demand. But what about supply? The promise is 400,000 affordable housing starts by 2020-21, including 200,000 starter homes sold at a 20% discount to market value, with \u00a32.3bn allocated to building the first 60,000. Another 135,000 homes will be built under shared ownership schemes open to anyone earning under \u00a390,000 (in London) or \u00a380,000 elsewhere. Combined with an easing up of planning rules, it adds up to a developers\u2019 charter, with Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Persimmon among the fastest-rising shares on the London stock exchange on the day of the chancellor\u2019s speech. Delivery is the problem. It\u2019s a very good time to be a brickmaker or bricklayer, with the industry hitting capacity constraints. But quite why this has become such a problem is a mystery; with a much smaller population, Britain built many more houses every year in the 1950s and 1960s. One reason is that small-scale developers were killed off during the financial crisis, leaving the market clear for the giant developers. But what\u2019s good for Barratts is not always what\u2019s good for Britain. Rental campaigners are nonplussed by the focus on the big housebuilders. Betsy Dillner of the Generation Rent campaigning group said: \u201cAfter raising \u00a36.9bn to invest in new affordable homes, George Osborne had an open goal, but by deciding to hand the money to private developers instead of bringing down rents for private renters, he has spooned the ball over the crossbar.\u201d Starter homes can be sold off at full market value after five years, which she calls \u201canother reckless giveaway\u201d. In Ireland, a country suffering a similar rental crisis to Britain, the government is introducing \u201crent certainty\u201d, a sort of rent control-lite. There is no sign of that happening this side of the Irish Sea. Britain\u2019s property laws urgently need reshaping, to give tenants better protection from absurd rent rises and retaliatory evictions, but also to give landlords better powers to deal with rogue tenants. But apart from cutting housing benefit, it\u2019s a subject George Osborne was silent on. By all means, put in place measures to revive owner occupation. But right now, generation rent can\u2019t even afford to pay the rent.",

They have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/05/homebuyers-camp-out-overnight-for-chance-to-buy-affordable-flat\">queued at new home launches</a>, or grim \u201copen days\u201d, where they have been consistently outbid by the financial firepower of tax-advantaged buy-to-let landlords. </p> <p>Hitting landlords and second-home buyers should provoke a welcome reduction in demand. But what about supply? The promise is 400,000 affordable housing starts by 2020-21, including 200,000 starter homes sold at a 20% discount to market value, with \u00a32.3bn allocated to building the first 60,000. Another 135,000 homes will be built under shared ownership schemes open to anyone earning under \u00a390,000 (in London) or \u00a380,000 elsewhere. Combined with an easing up of planning rules, it adds up to a developers\u2019 charter, with Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Persimmon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/25/autumn-statement-housing-plans-boost-building-stocks\">among the fastest-rising shares on the London stock exchange on the day of the chancellor\u2019s speech. </a></p> <p>Delivery is the problem. It\u2019s a very good time to be a brickmaker or bricklayer, with the industry hitting capacity constraints. But quite why this has become such a problem is a mystery; with a much smaller population, Britain built many more houses every year in the 1950s and 1960s. One reason is that small-scale developers were killed off during the financial crisis, leaving the market clear for the giant developers. But what\u2019s good for Barratts is not always what\u2019s good for Britain. </p> <p>Rental campaigners are nonplussed by the focus on the big housebuilders. Betsy Dillner of the <a href=\"http://www.generationrent.org/\">Generation Rent</a> campaigning group said: \u201cAfter raising \u00a36.9bn to invest in new affordable homes, George Osborne had an open goal, but by deciding to hand the money to private developers instead of bringing down rents for private renters, he has spooned the ball over the crossbar.\u201d Starter homes can be sold off at full market value after five years, which she calls \u201canother reckless giveaway\u201d. </p> <p>In Ireland, a country suffering a similar rental crisis to Britain, the government is introducing \u201crent certainty\u201d, a sort of rent control-lite. There is no sign of that happening this side of the Irish Sea. Britain\u2019s property laws urgently need reshaping, to give tenants better protection from absurd rent rises and retaliatory evictions, but also to give landlords better powers to deal with rogue tenants. But apart from cutting housing benefit, it\u2019s a subject George Osborne was silent on. By all means, put in place measures to revive owner occupation. But right now, generation rent can\u2019t even afford to pay the rent. </p>",

Shkreli\u2019s company Turing Pharmaceuticals announced on Wednesday that it would provide volume discounts of its drug Daraprim to hospitals, but it appears that the company\u2019s $750-a-pill price tag still stands. Turing and Shkreli attracted a firestorm of criticism in September after it was revealed the company had raised the price of Daraprim, a 62-year-old treatment for parasitic infections, to $750 a pill from $13.50 after acquiring it. The medicine once sold for $1 a pill. Shkreli pledged to lower the price of the drug in an interview shortly after being roundly pilloried by people including Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. But in a press release Nancy Retzlaff, Turing\u2019s chief commercial officer, said: \u201cDrug pricing is one of the most complex parts of the healthcare industry. A drug\u2019s list price is not the primary factor in determining patient affordability and access. A reduction in Daraprim\u2019s list price would not translate into a benefit for patients.\u201d Instead Turing will offer reductions of up to 50% to hospitals, introduce new, smaller bottles of 30 tablets and lower costs and offer free sample starter packages starting in early 2016. The moves are unlikely to pacify Turing\u2019s many critics. \u201cThis cost is unjustifiable for the medically vulnerable patient population in need of this medication and unsustainable for the healthcare system,\u201d wrote the Infectious Diseases Society of America in an open letter to Turing when the price hike was announced in September. Toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection, has been identified bythe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as one of five neglected parasitic diseases for which public health action is necessary.

      "bodyText": "A Spanish renewable energy group has collapsed into insolvency protection, it said on Wednesday, just months after US investment bank Citi led a \u20ac100m (\u00a370m) share sale to raise funds for the group. Abengoa shares dropped 70% in minutes after the company said it was entering insolvency protection after a deal for a \u20ac350m capital injection fell through. The collapse is especially embarrassing for Citi after it led a July share sale for the company at a price of \u20ac2.80 a share. On Wednesday Abengoa shares slumped to just \u20ac0.33. The company, which employs 24,000 people, is involved in renewable electricity generation, converting biomass into biofuel and desalination of seawater for drinking. Disgruntled investors, who subscribed to the shares at the time, have long questioned why Citi had not done more due diligence before acting on the share sale. Citi declined to comment on the latest turn of events at Abengoa. Days after the Citi-led share sale in the summer, the Spanish company revealed it was seeking to raise \u20ac650m of capital and dispose of \u20ac500m of assets. Then it alerted the market that its free cash flow for the year would be as much as \u20ac800m lower than previously forecast. One banker said on Wednesday that Citi had made a \u201cbig, big mistake\u201d, promoting the share sale without having more information on problems that lay ahead. However, there would have been limitations as to how much the company could have told it ahead of announcements to the market. Abengoa, which has been at the centre of speculation over its chances of survival for some time, had been hoping to receive an injection of capital from Spanish industrial group Gonvarri but was forced to tell the markets that the agreement had fallen through. \u201cThe company will begin the negotiating process with its creditors with the aim to reach an accord to guarantee the financial viability under the article 5 of the Bankruptcy Act, which the company intends to request as soon as possible,\u201d Abengoa said. Under Spanish law, companies can enter into pre-insolvency protection, giving them up to four months to reach an agreement with creditors to avoid a full-blown insolvency and a potential bankruptcy. Abengoa has been trying to find new investors since the end of July, when it announced a \u20ac650m rights issue of new shares to cut gross debt of some \u20ac8.9bn. Spanish and international banks\u2019 total exposure to Abengoa stands at around \u20ac20.2bn, including financing for projects, a source familiar with the matter said at the end of September. Gonvarri\u2019s interest was conditional on banks underwriting a rights issue agreed in September, asking the banks to inject \u20ac1.5bn into the company, Reuters sources told the news agency late on Tuesday. The group held a three-hour long conference call with investors after the publication of its results.",

Lewis has also put thousands more staff into stores and trimmed prices on well-known brands.

      "bodyText": "Banking is reaching its \u201cUber moment\u201d as technological advances will lead to hundreds of branch closures and a possible halving of people employed in the sector, the former chief executive of Barclays has warned. In a speech reported by Reuters, Antony Jenkins described technology as an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d that would lead to better customer service and a wave of new banks becoming household names. Jenkins, who was ousted from Barclays in July, said: \u201cThe number of branches and people employed in the financial services sector may decline by as much as 50% over the next 10 years, and even in a less harsh scenario I predict they will decline by at least 20%.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m predicting that over the next 10 years we will see a number of very significant disruptions in financial services, let\u2019s call them Uber moments,\u201d he said, as new financial technology firms exploit their advantage over the incumbent players. If his predictions come true, Barclays could cut between 26,000 and 66,000 jobs worldwide, and shut between 280 and 700 branches on the high street. Jenkins was delivering a speech at Chatham House entitled Approaching the Uber Moment in Financial Services. His successor at the helm of Barclays, Jes Staley, an American banker, takes over next week. When he was in charge of Barclays, Jenkins regularly discussed the impact of new technology on the industry. As long ago as 2013, he had said he could foresee circumstances under which 40,000 roles from the 140,000-strong workforce could be axed, as technology automated services and cut costs. \u201cThis was not about replacing colleagues with robots,\u201d he told his audience at Chatham House, but encouraging staff to focus on customers. Barclays has been trying to lead the way with new technology alongside its branch network, introducing services such as Pingit which allows transactions on mobile phones. New banks that will not have any branches are being established notably Atom bank, which intends to operate entirely as a smartphone app. Spanish bank BBVA this week took a 30% stake in Atom, spending \u00a345m to get its first major foothold on retail customers in Britain. \u201cTruly digital banks ... won\u2019t need to sustain a network of physical branches,\u201d Jenkins said, adding that they could provide a much more personal service. But, he said, for it to be a true \u201cUber moment\u201d the services need to be at least 10 times better than those already provided. These new banks have advantages over the incumbent players, which are weighed down by high cost bases of branches and old technology. Eventually they may be forced into mergers, Jenkins said. \u201cThe barriers to entry are quite high in financial services, so that will allow the incumbents to probably last longer than in many other industries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk is that incumbents will be pushed into this utility, capital-heavy role that we\u2019ve seen in other industries like telecoms. Ultimately, that will become intolerable to shareholders, so we could see consolidation and mergers,\u201d he said. He also said there was a major challenge for the banking industry in recruiting staff, discussing his recent visit to Silicon Valley which he described as a \u201cruthless meritocracy\u201d. \u201cIf banks want to really compete for talent successfully, they are going to have to make themselves interesting places to work. It can\u2019t just be about the money, because frankly the money isn\u2019t going to be there the way it was before 2008,\u201d Jenkins said. Analysts at Morgan Stanley predicted that banks would launch pilots and form new partnerships with fintech companies. They predicted the first moves would be on peer-to-peer lending and robo-advisers, a means of automating financial advice. \u201cWe think the digital agenda will come even more to the fore in 2016 and see growing concern from some management teams about the threats,\u201d the Morgan Stanley analysts said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC is attempting to address the lack of gender equality at the top of its operations by setting a target for equal numbers of women and men in senior roles in its UK arm. The bank will open a new head office for its high street operations in Birmingham by 2019, where it aims to achieve gender parity in the most senior of the approximately 550 roles by 2020. It is not immediately clear when the bank hopes to achieve the 50-50 target for the rest of its senior management, where 29% of the 5,500 senior management roles are held by women. As is the case with many banks, women make up more than half its entire 37,000 UK workforce: 54% of employees are female. But this representation quickly slides away in senior management and HSBC intends to implement policies to address this. It will require an equal number of men and women on shortlists, support a return to the workplace for senior candidates and introduce name-blind CVs in an effort to end discrimination. The Lord Davies review of boardroom diversity helped fuel the debate about the lack of women in senior roles. In 2011, Davies \u2013 a former banker \u2013 set a goal for women to hold 25% of boardroom roles by 2015. In October, that goal was extended to at least a third of boardroom positions at the UK\u2019s biggest companies being held by women by the end of the decade. The government has also put a focus on the financial services industry and earlier this month, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, published her Treasury-commissioned review of the sector. She urged companies to set their own gender-balance record, put senior individuals in charge of attaining the goals, and include the targets among those used to set bonuses. HSBC has considered reintroducing the Midland brand for its UK arm, which is being relocated to Birmingham to comply with the new ringfencing rules that require banks to cushion their high-street customers from their investment banking arms. Instead of putting Midland back on the high street, the UK arm will now be called HSBC UK. Antonio Simoes, who runs HSBC\u2019s UK arm, said: \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable that in 2015, women are still significantly underrepresented at a senior management level across the financial services industry. We are committed to putting that right at HSBC UK. \u201cOur ambition is to become the bank of choice in the UK. We have the opportunity to build a different type of bank through the creation of HSBC UK, which is more responsive to customer needs and fully reflects the diversity of society. Our aspiration is to achieve gender parity at all levels of the bank and to create a true meritocracy where everyone has the opportunity to develop their career, regardless of their background, age, gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity or beliefs,\u201d said Simoes. Other banks have set aspirational goals for gender diversity. Royal Bank of Scotland, 74% state-owned after being bailed out by the government after the 2008 financial crash, has set a target for women to hold one third of its top 600 management roles by 2020.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This holiday season the tale of two cities \u2013 one rich, one poor \u2013 is playing out once again in New York neighborhoods like the Upper West Side. While some New Yorkers are preparing a feast to mark Thanksgiving and are starting to cross gifts off of their holiday shopping lists, some of the poorest New Yorkers continue to struggle to put food on the table despite having a job. Hundreds of strugglers can be found at the Church of St Paul and St Andrew, which is also a home to West Side Campaign Against Hunger which holds the annual Thousand Turkey Challenge. Nestled between Central Park and Hudson River Greenway, the campaign and the pantry it runs happen to be located in one of New York\u2019s richest neighborhoods. According to the US Census, from 2010 to 2012, the median income on the Upper West Side was $93,258. A block from the pantry is The Belnord, a historic building with apartments that can cost as much as $45,000 a month to rent. On this Monday, just days before Thanksgiving, temperatures in New York City had finally dropped into the low 40s. On West 86th Street kids were being bundled off to school and pampered pooches were out for a stroll. Doormen, smiles firmly in place, were doing their morning dance \u2013 picking up papers, opening doors. A Christmas tree vendor was setting up on the corner and people on their way to work were lining up in a nearby Starbucks. Alberto Betancourt lives just two blocks away. His home, however, is nothing fancy. There is no gated yard like at The Belnord or multiple bedrooms and baths. It\u2019s just a small room at Capitol Hall \u2013 a supporting housing residence for men and women at risk of homelessness. At 61, Betancourt receives $600 a month in Supplemental Security Income, which is provided to the aged and disabled with little to no income. \u201cIt used to be $900, but it went down to $600,\u201d he said. About a third of his monthly income, a little over $200, goes towards his rent at Capitol Hall. And so instead of lining up at Starbucks, Betancourt is lining up at the food pantry. When it\u2019s his turn, he will receive enough food to last him three days. It\u2019s likely that he will receive no turkey \u2013 as those are reserved for families. The bigger the family, the bigger the turkey they can get. Betancourt might spend Thanksgiving with his neighbor \u2013 a man named Richard, who lives across the hall. \u201cWe help each other,\u201d Betancourt says simply. Like most people here, Betancourt comes to the pantry once a month. He says he keeps to himself. However, a few minutes later when an irritated woman begins to speak to a young mother with child, he kindly leans over and translates for the mother who speaks no English. A majority of the over 100 people gathered in the basement of the Church of St Paul and St Andrew are not from here. Many have made the trek early this morning from different neighborhoods like South Bronx and Washington Heights. Paulette, who lives in Washington Heights, came with a friend. The two breeze in smiling and park their rolling bags, which they will later use to transport their food back home. \u201cI come here because of the quality of the food,\u201d says Paulette, whose 21-year-old daughter will come home for Thanksgiving. She is currently away at college in Maine. Hopefully it being two of them at home this holiday will mean that Paulette gets to take a turkey home. At the mention of the bird, she smiles brightly: \u201cOh, I am looking forward to that.\u201d Paulette is trying to start her own business, sewing clothes and making alterations. On Thanksgiving, she will spend the morning sewing before she gets started on the dinner \u2013 turkey, stuffing, greens. She had invited some friends who have no families to join her and her daughter. Holidays can be hard on some people. \u201cIt\u2019s a time when people feel depressed or a little awkward,\u201d says Paulette, who also plans to share leftovers with her neighbors. As she talks, an older man pushes his walker past her. Balanced on top are two bags of food. Most people waiting their turn at the pantry declined to be interviewed. Not many wanted to share their woes \u2013 even as many are used to standing in lines, be they at the unemployment office, for food stamps or for food at pantries like this one. In the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, the pantry hopes to give away 1,000 turkeys in addition to the food they usually distribute. According to Brian Robinson, development director at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, bird flu has not affected the pantry\u2019s supply of birds. The pantry is stocked like a supermarket, where those in need walk through a small room with shelves and pick up rationed-out packets of beans, rice, pasta and bread as well as their pick of canned food and gallons of milk. There are also fruits and vegetables. Being able to select the food they want is more dignified than being given a bag of pre-selected food, says Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s food and service with dignity. We don\u2019t tell them what\u2019s best for them and their families.\u201d Food is only a short-term solution. The campaign also provides counseling and job training, such as chef school for those hoping to get a job at one of the many restaurants in New York City. \u201cThey come in for food and we help them become self-sufficient,\u201d says Robinson. Another lady walks in dragging a bag on wheels. \u201cAy, dios m\u00edo!\u201d she says, noting the crowd. Robinson estimates that on a day like this, between 300 to 400 people pass through the pantry. Since the pantry opened at eight o\u2019clock in the morning, the crowd has remained around 100 people strong. As soon as some people get their food and leave, new ones show up to take their place. They sit in plastic chairs arranged in lines, all facing forward. In the front, on the table near a flat-screen TV advertising Medicaid assistance and eviction protection serviced, is a manual scoreboard. Instead of showing a score for a game of some kind, it lists the current call number. As they enter the pantry, everyone is given a number \u2013 it\u2019s like a Department of Motor Vehicles but for food. While they wait for their number to come up, some chat with those nearby. One volunteer sits in the very front, cheerily she instructs the crowd on basic yoga stretches. Hands outstretched, about 10 women sitting in the front follow her lead. Another two women a few rows back join in. Two rows in front of them, a man has fallen asleep. Head back, mouth slightly open, he sleeps for a few seconds before waking up. He shifts in his chair and glances at the number up front before falling back asleep. Every few minutes, the number is changed by Digno Castillo, who has been volunteering at the pantry for nine months. Calmly, like a general, he instructs the crowd of 100 or more handing out numbers, telling them where to sit, where to park their cart or bag and where to line up for food. \u201cSometimes you have more people. Sometimes you have headaches. Sometimes you have no headaches,\u201d he says. In the first hour, he has interacted with about 160 people. About 60 people have received their food even as another 60 arrived. \u201cThey do a good job here. People here care about people. It\u2019s a lot of working families,\u201d says Lawrence, 66, who has been volunteering at the pantry for about 13 months. He is right. According to a report released on Tuesday by the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, about half of the New Yorkers aged 15 to 65 who could not afford food were employed. The same report showed that pantries, like the one where Lawrence works, have faced an increased demand of 5% in 2015. That\u2019s on top of an increased demand of 7% in 2014, 10% in 2013, 5% in 2012, 12% in 2011, 7% in 2010 and 20% in 2009. Lawrence likes working at the pantry, he says while packing chickens. He is retired now, but he used to work as a cook at a hotel in Midtown. People working at the pantry here don\u2019t speak down to people, don\u2019t treat them as below them. \u201cThey give them respect,\u201d he says. Then pointing to a couple of women leaving, their carts packed, he adds: \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice to see people leaving with a smile.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This holiday season the tale of two cities \u2013 one rich, one poor \u2013 is playing out once again in New York neighborhoods like the Upper West Side. While some New Yorkers are preparing a feast to mark Thanksgiving and are starting to cross gifts off of their holiday shopping lists, some of the poorest New Yorkers continue to struggle to put food on the table despite having a job. </p> <p>Hundreds of strugglers can be found at the Church of St Paul and St Andrew, which is also a home to <a href=\"http://www.wscah.org/\">West Side Campaign Against Hunger</a> which holds the annual Thousand Turkey Challenge. Nestled between Central Park and Hudson River Greenway, the campaign and the pantry it runs happen to be located in one of New York\u2019s richest neighborhoods. According to the US Census, from 2010 to 2012, the median income on the Upper West Side <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-yorks-new-income-map/\">was $93,258</a>. A block from the pantry is The Belnord, a historic building with apartments that can cost as much as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/nyregion/a-landmark-building-with-a-fraught-history.html?_r=0\">$45,000 a month to rent</a>.</p> <p>On this Monday, just days before Thanksgiving, temperatures in New York City had finally dropped into the low 40s. On West 86th Street kids were being bundled off to school and pampered pooches were out for a stroll. Doormen, smiles firmly in place, were doing their morning dance \u2013 picking up papers, opening doors. A Christmas tree vendor was setting up on the corner and people on their way to work were lining up in a nearby Starbucks.</p> <p>Alberto Betancourt lives just two blocks away. His home, however, is nothing fancy. There is no gated yard like at The Belnord or multiple bedrooms and baths. It\u2019s just a small room at <a href=\"http://www.goddard.org/page/capitol-hall-93.html\">Capitol Hall</a> \u2013 a supporting housing residence for men and women at risk of homelessness. At 61, Betancourt receives $600 a month in Supplemental Security Income, which is provided to the aged and disabled with little to no income. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3072af846d872c1c07f7c4869cae38e12b6c19c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3072af846d872c1c07f7c4869cae38e12b6c19c9/0_372_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alberto Betancourt, 61, poses for a portrait at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger on Monday morning.

More than a third of that goes to his rent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Welsh for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt used to be $900, but it went down to $600,\u201d he said. About a third of his monthly income, a little over $200, goes towards his rent at Capitol Hall. And so instead of lining up at Starbucks, Betancourt is lining up at the food pantry. </p> <p>When it\u2019s his turn, he will receive enough food to last him three days. It\u2019s likely that he will receive no turkey \u2013 as those are reserved for families. The bigger the family, the bigger the turkey they can get. Betancourt might spend Thanksgiving with his neighbor \u2013 a man named Richard, who lives across the hall. </p> <p>\u201cWe help each other,\u201d Betancourt says simply. </p> <p>Like most people here, Betancourt comes to the pantry once a month. He says he keeps to himself. However, a few minutes later when an irritated woman begins to speak to a young mother with child, he kindly leans over and translates for the mother who speaks no English. </p> <p>A majority of the over 100 people gathered in the basement of the Church of St Paul and St Andrew are not from here. Many have made the trek early this morning from different neighborhoods like South Bronx and Washington Heights. </p> <p>Paulette, who lives in Washington Heights, came with a friend. The two breeze in smiling and park their rolling bags, which they will later use to transport their food back home. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9db0219b332bfeb03da08ffde6147f4c5c73a123\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9db0219b332bfeb03da08ffde6147f4c5c73a123/0_226_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NEW YORK, NY - November 23rd, 2015: Shopping carts lined up at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger on Monday morning.

She is currently away at college in Maine. Hopefully it being two of them at home this holiday will mean that Paulette gets to take a turkey home. At the mention of the bird, she smiles brightly: \u201cOh, I am looking forward to that.\u201d</p> <p>Paulette is trying to start her own business, sewing clothes and making alterations. On Thanksgiving, she will spend the morning sewing before she gets started on the dinner \u2013 turkey, stuffing, greens. She had invited some friends who have no families to join her and her daughter. Holidays can be hard on some people. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a time when people feel depressed or a little awkward,\u201d says Paulette, who also plans to share leftovers with her neighbors. </p> <p>As she talks, an older man pushes his walker past her. Balanced on top are two bags of food. Most people waiting their turn at the pantry declined to be interviewed. Not many wanted to share their woes \u2013 even as many are used to standing in lines, be they at the unemployment office, for food stamps or for food at pantries like this one. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0e6ee09c7d60fe49fad44a3b70ca40409aa8a91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0e6ee09c7d60fe49fad44a3b70ca40409aa8a91/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NEW YORK, NY - November 23rd, 2015: Zoila Estrella, 74, a volunteer at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, checks recipients out in the food pantry on Monday morning.

According to Brian Robinson, development director at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, bird flu has not affected the pantry\u2019s supply of birds. The pantry is stocked like a supermarket, where those in need walk through a small room with shelves and pick up rationed-out packets of beans, rice, pasta and bread as well as their pick of canned food and gallons of milk. There are also fruits and vegetables. </p> <p>Being able to select the food they want is more dignified than being given a bag of pre-selected food, says Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s food and service with dignity. We don\u2019t tell them what\u2019s best for them and their families.\u201d</p> <p>Food is only a short-term solution. The campaign also provides counseling and job training, such as chef school for those hoping to get a job at one of the many restaurants in New York City.</p> <p>\u201cThey come in for food and we help them become self-sufficient,\u201d says Robinson.</p> <p>Another lady walks in dragging a bag on wheels. \u201c<em>Ay, dios m\u00edo!</em>\u201d she says, noting the crowd. Robinson estimates that on a day like this, between 300 to 400 people pass through the pantry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b1bcd81b31474c64900583f60977f6e682f5ccc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b1bcd81b31474c64900583f60977f6e682f5ccc/0_357_5389_3234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NEW YORK, NY - November 23rd, 2015: Recipients wait line for the food pantry at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger on Monday morning.

As soon as some people get their food and leave, new ones show up to take their place. They sit in plastic chairs arranged in lines, all facing forward. In the front, on the table near a flat-screen TV advertising Medicaid assistance and eviction protection serviced, is a manual scoreboard.</p> <p>Instead of showing a score for a game of some kind, it lists the current call number.</p> <p>As they enter the pantry, everyone is given a number \u2013 it\u2019s like a Department of Motor Vehicles but for food. While they wait for their number to come up, some chat with those nearby. One volunteer sits in the very front, cheerily she instructs the crowd on basic yoga stretches. Hands outstretched, about 10 women sitting in the front follow her lead. Another two women a few rows back join in. Two rows in front of them, a man has fallen asleep. Head back, mouth slightly open, he sleeps for a few seconds before waking up. He shifts in his chair and glances at the number up front before falling back asleep. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6217cf9feab87af9d960b800ff7519615df696e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6217cf9feab87af9d960b800ff7519615df696e3/0_197_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Digno Castillo calls the next number in line for the food pantry at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger on Monday morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Digno Castillo calls the next number in line for the food pantry at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger on Monday morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Welsh for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every few minutes, the number is changed by Digno Castillo, who has been volunteering at the pantry for nine months. Calmly, like a general, he instructs the crowd of 100 or more handing out numbers, telling them where to sit, where to park their cart or bag and where to line up for food. </p> <p>\u201cSometimes you have more people. Sometimes you have headaches. Sometimes you have no headaches,\u201d he says. In the first hour, he has interacted with about 160 people. About 60 people have received their food even as another 60 arrived.</p> <p>\u201cThey do a good job here. People here care about people. It\u2019s a lot of working families,\u201d says Lawrence, 66, who has been volunteering at the pantry for about 13 months. </p> <p>He is right. According to a report released on Tuesday by the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, about half of the New Yorkers aged 15 to 65 who could not afford food were employed. The same report showed that pantries, like the one where Lawrence works, have faced an increased demand of 5% in 2015. That\u2019s on top of an increased demand of 7% in 2014, 10% in 2013, 5% in 2012, 12% in 2011, 7% in 2010 and 20% in 2009.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18ac3470dfb7b208a3034a1f4822e891da9b6777\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18ac3470dfb7b208a3034a1f4822e891da9b6777/0_639_5146_2196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lawrence, right, and Haydeth Tavera, left, distribute chickens at the West Side Campaign Against Hunger on Monday morning.

The company said Guy Buswell had stepped down with immediate effect and by mutual agreement. UK Mail\u2019s founder and chairman, Peter Kane, will run the business while the board looks for a replacement. UK Mail issued a profit warning in August for the current year, blaming a glut of large parcels that its new hub in Ryton-on-Dunsmore, near Coventry, could not deal with. The problems led to a loss of customers and reduced volumes. Its interim dividend was cut by a quarter last week after profit more than halved in the first six months. Buswell said problems at Ryton meant next year\u2019s profits would be worse than expected. Buswell said at the time that investment in the high-speed sorting equipment would pay off but that the problems were taking longer to sort out than expected. Kane said: \u201cThe board and I would like to thank Guy for his contribution to the company over the past 10 years in his role as chief executive and wish him well for the future.\u201d Buswell\u2019s departure leaves UK Mail without a chief executive a month before Christmas and two days before Black Friday, when online orders are expected to create a record volumes of parcels. The company\u2019s operations director, Carl Moore, left in October and his replacement is not due to start until the new year. Parcels are a growth area as shopping moves online. Royal Mail is the biggest operator but UK Mail, which Kane built from a taxi firm he set up in 1971, says it is the next biggest group in the market. It delivers for businesses such as O2 and TalkTalk. Buswell joined UK Mail in 1989 and, after a spell working elsewhere, rejoined in 1997, becoming chief executive in 2005. Kane was chief executive before becoming chairman in 2001. UK Mail shares fell 3.4% to 309p in early trading on Wednesday and are down 41% since August\u2019s profit warning.",

    "webTitle": "Travel industry in 'greatest turmoil in 30 years' after Paris attacks, says Thomas Cook boss", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The travel industry is facing the greatest turmoil in 30 years because of the recent series of incidents capped by the terrorist attacks on Paris, said Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser. He pointed to a \u201cstring of external shocks\u201d including the killing of 38 holidaymakers in Tunisia in June and the bombing of a Russian plane flying from Egypt that killed all 224 people on board last month. Those terrorist attacks were followed by the murder of 130 people in Paris last week. International tensions increased on Tuesday when Turkish aircraft shot down a Russian fighter over Turkey\u2019s border with Syria. Fankhauser, who has run the tour operator for the past year, said: \u201cThere is an unprecedented level of disruption in [more] of our markets. In my 30 years in the industry I have never seen anything like it.\u201d He said Thomas Cook had experienced a fall in bookings from France and other European countries after the Paris attacks. But he said he expected confidence to return quickly, as it did after other incidents such as the deliberate crashing of a Germanwings passenger plane by its co-pilot in May. \u201cIf you have a shock like Tunisia or the Germanwings crash you have a decline in bookings because people don\u2019t want to think about holidays immediately. The confidence is coming back quite soon. This is what we had in our experience of the last shocks.\u201d His comments echoed those made by Carolyn McCall, the boss of easyJet, who said last week that the budget airline had seen a drop-off in passengers flying in and out of France but that travel was such a big part of people\u2019s lives that the desire to fly would resume soon. Thomas Cook has cancelled flights to Egypt until December and Fankhauser said he would follow government instructions at a meeting scheduled for Wednesday. EasyJet and British Airways\u2019 owner IAG have already delayed any flights to Egypt until January. Fankhauser was talking as he unveiled Thomas Cook\u2019s first annual net profit for five years, during which the company almost collapsed. He said the company was at a turning point despite the turbulent backdrop. For the year ended 30 September, Thomas Cook swung to a post-tax profit of \u00a319m from a loss of \u00a3115m a year earlier. Pre-tax profit was \u00a3170m, compared with a loss of \u00a3114m the year before. The company\u2019s shares rose almost 10% to 108p. Performance was driven by good business in the UK, where underlying earnings rose 42% to \u00a3119m. The current year has started well with strong winter holiday trading in the UK and northern Europe, the company said. It is launching a new brand, Casa Cook, aimed at urban professionals as it seeks to move upmarket. As well as facing financial problems and external shocks, Thomas Cook was beset by an outcry over its treatment of the family of two children who died at a hotel booked through the company in 2006. Christi and Bobby Shepherd were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a faulty boiler at a bungalow attached to a hotel in Corfu. After almost a decade during which the company kept the children\u2019s parents at arm\u2019s length, Fankhauser apologised in May and agreed to work with Sharon Wood and Neil Shepherd. Last week Thomas Cook launched a Safer Tourism Foundation with the support of Sharon Wood. Fankhauser said: \u201cThe past year has also presented considerable challenges for Thomas Cook as we confronted the mistakes that were made following the deaths of Bobby and Christi Shepherd in Corfu nine years ago. The fact that I have got to this stage with Sharon says a lot about how far we have come.\u201d",

But he said he expected confidence to return quickly, as it did after other incidents such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/06/germanwings-co-pilot-practised-descent-move-previous-flight-andreas-lubitz\">deliberate crashing of a Germanwings passenger plane</a> by its co-pilot in May. </p> <p>\u201cIf you have a shock like Tunisia or the Germanwings crash you have a decline in bookings because people don\u2019t want to think about holidays immediately.

EasyJet and British Airways\u2019 owner IAG have already delayed any flights to Egypt until January.</p> <p>Fankhauser was talking as he unveiled Thomas Cook\u2019s first annual net profit for five years, during which the company almost collapsed.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s like being Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic.\u201d Terry Murphy, John Lewis\u2019s director of national distribution, is standing by the railings on a high deck, staring out at the frenetic action below. There\u2019s no water around him, just a sea of machinery and hundreds of thousands of green plastic crates trundling along metal conveyors in every direction. Stripey socks, champagne flutes and fluffy slippers are off to be packed into cardboard boxes and sent out to customers; mixed boxes of tableware or footwear are headed to stores and yet more crates are destined for high storage racks after being unpacked from waves of cardboard boxes delivered by suppliers. At 5am on Black Friday morning, Murphy will be back here hoping his ship \u2013 John Lewis\u2019s massive Magna Park distribution centre near Milton Keynes \u2013 can avoid the icebergs of faulty machinery or broken down vans which could freeze sales on what is expected to be the biggest shopping day of the year. Black Friday barely existed in the UK three years ago. This week, more than \u00a31.6bn of sales are expected to be rung up \u2013 in stores and online \u2013 as the final pay day before Christmas combines with a rash of discounts inspired by the American tradition of post-Thanksgiving bargains. Last year, John Lewis experienced the busiest sales day in its 150-year history. It is expecting to beat that with 20% more going through its tills and online store. It has increased capacity of its website by a third to cope with expected orders. Its plans are based on guesstimates. Black Friday is so new that retailers are unsure exactly what will happen. The owner of Argos, Home Retail Group, has already issued a profit warning on fears that its heavy spending on advertising and new delivery vans may not feed through into strong Black Friday sales. Asda has moved away from Black Friday deals after the day proved unprofitable. John Roberts, the boss of electrical goods retailer AO.com, has admitted that his company failed to make money out of Black Friday, but he is hoping for another big uplift in sales as he sees it a chance to win over new customers. Alex Baldock, chief executive of online retailer Shop Direct, sees the day as an opportunity after signing up 21,000 new shoppers on Black Friday last year. \u201cWe like it. It\u2019s good for us and it\u2019s not a vanity exercise; it\u2019s a commercial exercise,\u201d he says. The company, which owns the Littlewoods and Very.co.uk websites, has prepared its systems to handle a third more sales after experiencing a record sales day last year. John Lewis will be opening its online store at midnight on 27 November and Murphy says his team will closely examine the first flush of sales to gauge if they need to tweak the system. If things begin to look overloaded, they will move forward the ordering deadline for next-day deliveries to spread demand. The first hour will be a trading peak, followed by another between 7-10am as people check out the morning news and social media and decide to look for bargains. \u201cYou have got to be on top of your game in the early hours of the morning,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cIt\u2019s a test: can you do what you\u2019re supposed to do? People here say they are not missing it; they want to be part of it.\u201d At Magna Park, there will be 250 more people on duty this year than last, as manual packing stations are drilled into action to supplement the usual operations dominated by automatic box-packing and crate unpacking machines. Across John Lewis\u2019s five distribution centres, there will be 2,000 extra people working compared with the retailer\u2019s quiet days. Some John Lewis staff will be working six days a week after cutting a deal to take extra holiday at other times of the year. The retailer has drafted in four external distribution companies to work with its own fleet, two more than last year when it was nearly caught out by the collapse of City Link. \u201cWe are trying to de-risk and not have all our eggs in one basket,\u201d says Murphy. At Magna Park this week, about 1,500 people are working over three shifts a day to keep the centre operating around the clock. Over the past few days, the centre has been piling out 350,000 units a day to stores, about double the average, ensuring they are well stocked for Black Friday when the centre will focus on internet orders. Murphy and his team began planning for this weekend nearly a year ago. They have installed two extra box-packing machines after they ran out of capacity to pack small boxes last year, such was the demand for the fastest selling product - the iPad mini. Murphy thinks expensive beauty products could be a new bestseller and so there is a new packing system just to handle those lotions and potions alongside jewellery. In all, the system will be able to handle 20% more than it could last year. They aim to process 6,000 items an hour or potentially up to 7,000 if everything goes to plan.
