    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Here\u2019s a quick closing summary. Economists have hailed Germany\u2019s economic resilience after it grew by 0.6% in the first quarter of the year, twice as fast as the UK and France. Business investment, consumer spending and exports all helped Germany\u2019s GDP expand at a faster pace, up from 0.4% in Q4 2016. Some experts say it confirms that Germany is still getting a competitive boost from the euro, which makes its exports more attractive to buyers outside the single currency. America\u2019s economy continues to benefit from strong consumer confidence, with the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index rising again. But US retail sales grew less than expected last month, and core inflation dipped - leaving Wall Street traders wondering if US interest rates may rise more gently than expected this year. Britons woke up to fresh talk of falling real wages this year, and warnings that jobs and investment will be lost if a \u2018smooth Brexit\u2019 can\u2019t be achieved. But the country can also cheer its biggest ever investment in a private company, after virtual simulation firm Improbable nailed a $500m investment. Learn more here: Thanks for reading and commenting. Hope you have a great weekend. GW European stock markets have closed for the week, with Britain\u2019s blue-chip index leading the way. The FTSE 100 finished 48 points higher at 7435, a gain of 0.6%. That\u2019s just 12 points shy of its record intraday high, set in mid-March, and a new all-time closing high. The French CAC and German DAX both gained around 0.5%. But Chris Beauchamp of IG sounds nervous, and suggests that the rally could be petering out..... It cannot be said to have been the most exciting week in stock markets, despite the FTSE 100 touching its highest level in over seven weeks..... With US earnings season out of the way, it looks like investors are fast running out of reasons to buy stocks. The attempt at a rally from earlier in the week has fizzled out, and while the decline has yet to turn into a full-blown rout, the number of fallers continues to outnumber the gainers, a sign that all is not well beneath the surface of the S&amp;P 500. US consumer sentiment is still sky-high, says Michael Pearce of Capital Economics, thanks to the stock market rally and strong jobs market. Here\u2019s his take on the Michigan confidence report: The small increase in the University of Michigan measure of consumer confidence leaves it at a level consistent with consumption growth rebounding to over 5% annualised in the second quarter. Spending growth is unlikely to rise quite that sharply, but this still suggests that the weak 0.3% annualised gain in the first quarter was a one-off. The slight rise in the headline measure to 97.7 in May, from 97.0 was a little better than the consensus forecast for no change. The high level of consumer confidence is consistent with the strength of its underlying drivers; labour market conditions are healthy, the stock market is close to a record high, and gasoline prices have remained low. US consumer confidence has risen has people become more optimistic about economic prospects. That\u2019s according to the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched confidence index, which has jumped to 97.7 from 97.0 in April, beating forecasts of a smaller rise to 97.2. The survey\u2019s tracker of current conditions was unchanged at 112.7, but the expectations gauge rose pretty sharply, to 88.1 from 87.0. There are a couple of sharp moves on the London stock market today. Pharmaceuticals firm AstraZeneca has surged 9% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after reporting that its immunotherapy drug, durvalumab, has been found to cut the risk of death in patients with advanced lung cancer. But Petrofac, which provides services to the oil industry, has slumped by 13% after telling shareholders that its chief executive and chief operating officer have been questioned by the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO says the inquiry relates to an investigation into Monaco-based Unaoil, related to allegations of possible money-laundering and bribery. Wall Street has just opened, cautiously, for the final trading day of the week. The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 both dipped a little, while the Nasdaq is creeping a little higher as the rally in tech stocks continues. The dollar is coming under pressure, too, following the drop in core inflation an hour ago. That shows that traders are reassessing their expectations for US interest rate hikes this year. The drop in US core inflation last month is a headache for the Federal Reserve, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. He says: To some extent, this new weakness in price inflation is due to competitive pressures rather than weak demand, so the Fed can afford to discount it. But even under those circumstances, it increases the downside risks to our above-consensus view that the Fed will hike interest rates three more times this year. The US retail sales figures are a somewhat mixed bag. Retail spending rose by 0.4% in April, new figures show, missing forecasts of a 0.6% rise. But it\u2019s not all bad. March\u2019s figure has been revised to a 0.1% rise in spending, not the 0.2% fall previously estimated. Sales of furniture and home furnishings dipped by 0.5%, while spending on electrical goods and appliances rose by 1.3%. Associated Press has a good take: The increase suggests that consumers may spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy\u2019s and JC Penney\u2019s, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns rather than broader economic weakness. Sales at department stores fell 0.2 percent. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 percent, the strongest of any group. Here comes the deluge of US economic data.... ....and consumer prices rose by 0.2% month-on-month in April, bang in line with forecasts. That follows a 0.3% drop in March. Housing, energy, tobacco, and food all contributed to the monthly increase in inflation, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The energy index gained 1.1% and the food index rose 0.2 percent, mostly due to a sharp increase in the index for fresh vegetables. The annual rate of CPI came in at 2.2%, down from 2.4% in March. But significantly, annual core inflation (stripping out food and energy) fell to 1.9%. A few more photos from the G7 finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Bari have arrived. Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan told reporters that Italy is pushing for more measures to fight inequality, saying: \u201cInclusive growth means first of all that growth has to be shared with all segment and regions of society,\u201d Christine Lagarde is also in Bari, and pushing European leaders to give more specific commitments to Greece on debt relief. Lagarde says: \u201cWe will carry on working on this debt relief package. There is not enough clarity yet but I hope that the European partners will continue to progress in that.\u201d Lagarde added that the IMF\u2019s position on Greece has not changed, effectively dismissing reports that the Fund had agreed to join the bailout. Germany\u2019s success is due in no small part to the euro, says Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments. That\u2019s because the single currency gives German exporters an extra competitive they wouldn\u2019t have with the Deutsche Mark (which would surely trade at a higher exchange rate if it still existed). Kapadia says: \u201cThe German economy is firing on all cylinders, delivering a robust economic performance across all sectors supported by a surge in business investments and higher consumer spending. Germany\u2019s gross domestic product grew at a quarterly clip of 0.6%, or 2.4% in annualized terms, outpacing the likes of Britain and France comfortably. The country may well be the top performer in the G7. The only other major competitor could be Canada. One of the most important factors to note here is that German trade is strong and helped by a undervalued Euro, consistently delivering a trade surplus. It is now one of the most steady markets in Europe and amongst developed economies.\u201d The pound hasn\u2019t had a great morning, as worries over the UK\u2019s economy linger. Sterling has lost 0.25% this morning to $1.2843, a one-week low. Yesterday, the Bank of England trimmed its growth forecasts and warned that wages will lag behind inflation this year (a message we\u2019ve heard again this morning). Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX says: \u201cThe pound was down against major peers today despite the strength seen over the past week, mainly due to the reduction of the Bank of England\u2019s growth forecasts for 2017 which were cut from 2% to 1.9%. Germany\u2019s strong growth in the last quarter is partly down to Angela Merkel\u2019s open-door policy on refugees, argues Timo Klein, principal German economist at IHS Markit. Klein writes: Private consumption continues to be underpinned by the ongoing improvement in labour market and income conditions and should thus overcome the recent setback related to the surge in headline inflation that has reduced real purchasing power. Government consumption is being supported by expenditures for refugees. Meanwhile, the construction sector may have received an extra boost in Q1 from a mild winter, which will trigger a recoil effect in Q2, but a combination of large demographic pressure for residential building (including pent-up demand), persistently favorable financing conditions, and government efforts to boost infrastructure investment will ensure strong growth impulses from this sector for many quarters to come. Klein also believes German businesses have shed their worries over Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, which is why they boosted capital spending. Investors seem to have come to the conclusion that the threat of US president Trump disrupting global trade patterns via protectionist measures has been overblown. Back in the UK, a software developer specialising in virtual simulation is celebrating after securing the biggest financing round for a private British company. Improbable, set up by a group of 2o-something Cambridge computer science graduates, has raised over $500bn from Japan\u2019s Softbank. That values the company at over $1bn - putting it in Unicorn territory. Improbable uses distributed computing power, or cloud computing, to create virtual worlds and accurate simulations of the real world. Here\u2019s our news story on the deal: And with \u2018unlimited vacation\u2019, free meals, social events and flexible working, Improbable sounds like quite the model of a modern tech firm.... With strong growth figures in his pocket, Germany\u2019s finance minister is calling on America to deliver strong leadership to help the world economy. Arriving in Bari for a meeting of G7 finance ministers, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told reporters that his message to US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is: We need a strong United States to lead the global economy and global politics on a sustainable way. Mnuchin has also arrived in Bari, sporting a fine pair of shades and hailing the new trade agreement reached with China overnight. He told the press pack that: \u201cOh, I think we\u2019re excited about US trade policies and I think you probably saw last night we made an announcement of a100-day economic plan with the Chinese so I think we are very happy with how we are proceeding on trade.\u201d As mentioned earlier, the new deal will open China up to US credit rating agencies and credit card companies, and also allow American farmers to export beef to Chinese consumers. Ho hum. The latest eurozone industrial production figures have just landed, and at first glance they\u2019re weaker than expected. Industrial output across the euro area fell by 0.1% in March, dragged down by weak energy production, dashing hopes of a rise. Dig into the data, though, and it\u2019s more encouraging. Output of goods for consumers and businesses actually rose. Here\u2019s the details, via Eurostat Energy production: Down by 3.2% month-on-month Capital goods: Up by 0.2% Intermediate goods: Up by 0.3% Durable consumer goods Up by 0.9% Non-durable consumer goods: Up by 2.1%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, agrees that Germany\u2019s GDP report has cheered the City. He writes: This morning has started in positive fashion for the Eurozone, in what is fast becoming the go-to growth driver of the western world. The outperformance of German Q1 GDP should have come as no surprise given the positive signs coming out of the industrial powerhouse over recent months. With the French hoping to strengthen their economy in the wake of Macron\u2019s election victory, there appears to be an end to the sight of the protracted downturn seen in the eurozone since the 2007 financial crisis. The pick-up in German growth should reassure global investors, who\u2019ve been throwing money into Europe in recent weeks. As this chart shows, investors have been buying European shares for several weeks now - with a record surge following the French presidential election: Following a fresh warning on living standards from the Bank of England on Thursday, two leading economists have warned this morning that Britons will all be poorer over the next five years as Brexit delivers a blow to the economy. Andrew Lilico, executive director of Europe Economics, said that Britain will probably lose out on a year\u2019s worth of growth over the next few years, before expanding at a faster pace in the 2020s. Lilico told BBC Radio 4\u2019 Today programme: Few things in life involving major changes come cost free so I think we should expect to lose a couple of percentage points of GDP growth - the equivalent of one year\u2019s growth over the period of 2019/2020. Then in the 2020s I expect it to grow a little bit faster and by 2030 everything will have come out in the wash.\u201d Ngaire Woods, dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University, agreed that UK households would be worse off over the next five years but was less optimistic about a swift turnaround in fortunes thereafter. The real effect of Brexit won\u2019t happen until Brexit happens. I\u2019m optimistic that Britain can secure a free trade agreement with Europe, but it will take at least 10 years. \u201cIf there are no smooth arrangements we\u2019re going to see a sharp decrease in investment and therefore a sharp decrease in jobs and that will mean a much more serious reduction in household incomes.\u201d Germany\u2019s robust growth has helped European stock markets to gain some ground in early trading. Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 24 points, or 0.2%, and the other main indices are also up a little: Only Canada can prevent Germany from claiming the title of becoming the fastest growing major economy in the first quarter of 2017. Nina Adam of the Wall Street Journal explains: Germany\u2019s economy accelerated in the first quarter, driven by a revival in global trade and buoyant construction activity. Germany\u2019s gross domestic product grew at a quarterly clip of 0.6%, or 2.4% in annualized terms, the Destatis statistics office said Friday. This met economists\u2019 forecasts and meant Germany\u2019s economy comfortably outpaced the U.S., which expanded by 0.7% annualized in the first quarter. The U.K., Japan, France and Italy also recorded lower growth rates than Germany. Canada is the only Group of Seven country that may record a stronger first-quarter result when it publishes its estimate in late May. We have further good news on the European economy, via France. The French employment total has hit its highest level since the financial crisis, after jumping by almost 50,000 in the last quarter to 16.228 million. The service sector drove the recovery, creating 56,200 net new jobs, while 4,800 jobs were lost in industry and 2,000 in construction. This is the seventh quarter of net job creation in a row, indicating that president-elect Emmanuel Macron will inherit a strengthening economy. Today\u2019s growth report also provides fresh ammunition to critics - such as the Trump administration - who claim Germany is getting an unfair advantage from a weak currency. Certainly, the jump in exports in Q1 indicates that German trade is humming. That means Germany\u2019s trade surplus (another cause of concern) will remain around record levels. Bankhaus Lampe analyst Alexander Krueger believes. the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus programme is clearly helping, saying: A boom without end in Germany... and despite all the risks. However, it should be noted that the economy would be humming less without the support of interest rates which are too low for Germany.\u201d Today\u2019s GDP report doesn\u2019t contain any sign that Brexit is hurting Germany\u2019s economy. The surge in business investment shows that German business leaders are planning for future growth, while higher consumer spending suggests families aren\u2019t worried either. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, is also impressed with Germany\u2019s performance, saying \u201cThe economy seems to be firing on all cylinders\u201d. Germany is on track for a decent year, according to Jens Kramer, an economist at NordLB in Hanover. Kramer says (via Bloomberg): \u201cEconomic momentum is extremely robust and very broadly based,\u201d \u201cThe steady increase in employment is fertile soil for domestic demand, and trade is providing impulses as well.\u201d Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet says Germany achieved broad-based growth in the last quarter - with decent weather helping to deliver that 0.6% growth. The FT points out that Germany outperformed its international rivals in the last quarter: America\u2019s quarterly growth rate was below 0.2% in Q1, while the UK and France both grew by 0.3%. Howard Archer of IHS Markit has tweeted the key points: Breaking: Germany\u2019s economy grew twice as fast as Britain at the start of 2017. German GDP expanded by 0.6% in the January-March quarter, up from 0.4% in the final three months of 2016. The growth was driven by higher business investment on new equipment and buildings, plus higher spending by consumers and the government. Strong exports also helped Europe\u2019s powerhouse economy make a robust start to the year. The Federal Statistics Office says: Capital formation [business spending] increased substantially. Due to the mild weather, fixed capital formation especially in construction, but also in machinery and equipment was markedly up compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Households and general government increased their final consumption expenditure slightly at the beginning of the year. In addition, the development of foreign trade was more dynamic and contributed to growth as exports increased more than imports, according to provisional results. In contrast, Britain\u2019s GDP only rose by 0.3% during the first quarter, as the UK service sector suffered a slowdown. But on an annual basis, the picture is different. Germany\u2019s Q1 growth was 1.7% higher than a year earlier (once you adjust for seasonal factors), while Britain\u2019s was 2.1% higher, year-on-year. More details and reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be looking at Germany, as GDP figures for the first three months of this year are released at 7am BST. Economists predict growth of around 0.6%, after various soft data has suggested the German economy began strongly. At 10am, the latest eurozone industrial production report is expected to show growth of 0.3% for March. America\u2019s economy is also in focus, with inflation and retail sales figures at 1.30pm BST. Headline inflation is expected to dip to 2.3%, from 2.4%, while retail sales are tipped to rise by 0.5% after falling in February and March. Traders are also digesting the news that America and China have signed a new trade agreement -- perhaps a sign of warming relations between the two powers. From Beijing, Tom Phillips reports: Relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies have hit \u201ca new high\u201d, Donald Trump\u2019s commerce secretary has claimed, announcing a \u201cherculean\u201d trade deal between Washington and Beijing in the latest sign of warming ties. Under the agreement China will allow imports of US beef, while the US will allow the import of cooked poultry from China. Beijing will also permit foreign financial services companies to provide credit-rating services in China. European stock markets are expected to open calmly, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 called up a modest 1 point. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A five-year old British virtual simulation startup, co-founded by Cambridge computer science graduates, has been valued at more than $1bn after raising $502m (\u00a3390m) from Japan\u2019s SoftBank. The investment in the London-based firm Improbable is thought to be the largest made in a fledgling European tech firm. Improbable uses cloud-based software to create virtual worlds for use in games as well as large-scale simulations of the real world. The capabilities of the company\u2019s technology have been likened to The Matrix, in which humans plug into a simulated world powered by computers. The business was co-founded in 2012 by Herman Narula, 29, and Rob Whitehead, 26, who met while studying computer science at the University of Cambridge, and Peter Lipka, 28, an Imperial College graduate who worked at Goldman Sachs before launching Improbable. The three co-founders hold a majority equity stake in Improbable \u2013 meaning they share a paper fortune of more than half a billion dollars \u2013 with Narula holding enough voting rights to control the company. They are not taking any cash out of the business as a result of the investment. SoftBank, which has put its managing director, Deep Nishar, on Improbable\u2019s board, will have only a minority stake in the business. Narula, Improbable\u2019s chief executive, said the company held talks with multiple investors but after a trip to Tokyo it was decided that Softbank had an \u201calignment of vision that made them the obvious choice\u201d. Narula and Whitehead, the chief technology officer, met at a dissertation review at Cambridge\u2019s computer lab, where they discovered \u201ca mutual interest in multiplayer games and virtual worlds\u201d that put them on the path to creating the software that underpins Improbable. \u201cWe talked about so many games and so many ideas about how games are made and run,\u201d Narula said. \u201cWe believe the next major phase in computing will be the emergence of large-scale virtual worlds.\u201d Narula was born in Delhi, India; he moved to the UK when he was three and attended Haberdashers\u2019 Aske\u2019s boys school. He taught himself to write code using C++ at 12 and chose to pursue a career in computing rather than entering the family construction business. After meeting Whitehead, a Liverpudlian who bolstered his student funds by making virtual weapons and selling them on the online virtual world of Second Life, he launched Improbable in 2012, months before graduating from university. Improbable\u2019s early days followed a familar tech startup path: credit cards were maxed out to buy equipment and a friends and family loan got them through the first couple of years in a converted barn next door to Narula\u2019s family home in north London. Staffers ate, slept and coded there, with Narula and Whitehead reportedly holding interviews in the shower room. The firm \u2013 which is now based in Farringdon, close to the so-called \u201csilicon roundabout\u201d tech hub in Shoreditch, east London \u2013 employs about 200 staff. It recently opened offices in San Francisco. Narula is keen to distance the firm from the stereotypical US tech startup, as satirised in the TV show Silicon Valley, saying the founders seek to cultivate a distinctive British culture. However, Improbable does offer perks including unlimited holidays, free breakfast and lunch, and a so-called life concierge to \u201crelocate families, organise parties, order pizza and service bikes\u201d. Before SoftBank\u2019s investment, Improbable raised $20m in 2015 from backers, including US venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz, which supported Facebook and Twitter, valuing the firm at $100m. Improbable\u2019s other investors include Horizon Ventures, and a fund run by British tech investor Saul Klein and David Rowan, editor-at-large at Wired magazine. Improbable\u2019s technology SpatialOS, which enables the creation of massive simulations \u2013 \u201cvirtual worlds\u201d \u2013 is still in beta mode and has not been publicly launched. The company is working with Bossa Studios on launching a giant multiplayer game called World\u2019s Adrift with one virtual area \u201cthe size of Wales\u201d. The company made a loss of \u00a38m in the year to the end of May 2016, according to the most recently available figures at Companies House. This was up on a 2015 loss of \u00a33.9m. Improbable\u2019s assets were valued at \u00a320m in 2016, up from \u00a310.2m in 2015. Softbank Japan\u2019s SoftBank, founded by Masayoshi Son, has developed a taste for UK tech firms after controversially buying Arm Holdings, the Cambridge-based chip designer , after the Brexit vote last year for \u00a324.3bn. Son, 59, is a serial dealmaker who has never shied away from ruffling feathers in his three decades building the tech to telecoms conglomerate. In 2012, he faced criticism when the company revealed a $22bn plan to take control of US mobile phone network Sprint, in what was the biggest foreign acquisition by a Japanese company at the time. Son, Japan\u2019s richest man with a $21bn fortune, has built a Softbank investment portfolio that includes Vodafone\u2019s Japanese business, Yahoo Japan and a humanoid robotics unit. A prescient move to take a $20m position in Jack Ma\u2019s Alibaba paid off after it grew to be worth $65bn after the Chinese e-commerce\u2019s site\u2019s IPO in 2014. Son, born in Japan and of Korean heritage, shocked investors last year and abruptly lost his heir apparent, former Google high-flyer Nikesh Arora, after reneging on an agreement to hand over the reins on his 60th birthday this August. He plans to stay on at least another five to 10 years. \u201cI asked myself whether I have run out of energy and ambition,\u201d Son said. On Friday, it emerged that SoftBank, Sprint\u2019s largest shareholder, and Sprint have had informal contact with T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom about a potential merger.",

Narula, Improbable\u2019s chief executive, said the company held talks with multiple investors but after a trip to Tokyo it was decided that Softbank had an \u201calignment of vision that made them the obvious choice\u201d.</p> <p>Narula and Whitehead, the chief technology officer, met at a dissertation review at Cambridge\u2019s computer lab, where they discovered \u201ca mutual interest in multiplayer games and virtual worlds\u201d that put them on the path to creating the software that underpins Improbable.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71454a1be79813b7893000eca8b6104eb7b6e3c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71454a1be79813b7893000eca8b6104eb7b6e3c0/365_21_3665_2199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Improbable chief executive Herman Narula\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Improbable chief executive Herman Narula.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Improbable</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe talked about so many games and so many ideas about how games are made and run,\u201d Narula said. \u201cWe believe the next major phase in computing will be the emergence of large-scale virtual worlds.\u201d</p> <p>Narula was born in Delhi, India; he moved to the UK when he was three and attended Haberdashers\u2019 Aske\u2019s boys school.

      "bodyText": "A Royal Mail delivery company has been forced to launch a review into whether it is wrongly classifying hundreds of couriers as self-employed contractors, in the latest breakthrough by trade unions campaigning for more secure employment status for members of the fast-growing gig economy. The move came after eCourier, a subsidiary of Royal Mail specialising in same-day deliveries, admitted on Friday it had incorrectly classified 23-year-old London-based bicycle courier Demille Flanore as an independent contractor and had wrongly denied him standard employment benefits such as holiday pay he should have been entitled to as a \u201cworker\u201d. Rather than contest an employment tribunal claim, the company promised to pay Flanore \u00a3545 to settle the case. eCourier\u2019s chief executive, Ian Oliver, immediately announced a review to work out how best to implement the same worker status \u201cfor colleagues where it reflects their actual working arrangements with us\u201d. Almost all of eCourier\u2019s 350 delivery riders who are on the road each day are on the same terms as Flanore. eCourier turned over \u00a322m in 2016. Flanore\u2019s union, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, described the admission of wrongful behaviour as \u201ca major sea change\u201d for the gig economy and called on eCourier to \u201cimmediately guarantee worker status to all of its couriers\u201d. The terms of the the company\u2019s agreement with Flanore read: \u201cThe respondent admits that during the claimant\u2019s engagement by the respondent he was engaged as a worker \u2026 which for the avoidance of doubt includes an entitlement to holiday pay as claimed by the claimant.\u201d The union had argued that Flanore was not a self-employed contractor because he was instructed on what to do by a \u201ccontroller\u201d, he was required to work exclusively for eCourier, all jobs were booked and allocated to him by eCourier, and eCourier set the prices to customers and what it would pay him. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with this outcome,\u201d Flanore said. \u201cIt is a step in the right direction for the courier industry and for people still working in it that want to take other cases to court. I hope as a result of this people that come to the industry now will have more sustainability and better terms than we had.\u201d Oliver, his employer, said: \u201cEmployment status is not a black and white, pass or fail issue. It is a matter of interpretation given all of the facts of an individual\u2019s working arrangements. On review, we believe that in the case of Mr Flanore, worker status reflected his working relationship with us.\u201d The company has previously warned classifying couriers as workers would increase costs. In its latest annual report, its directors said the \u201cprincipal risk\u201d to eCourier\u2019s business was if employment tribunal judges ruled their couriers were workers, not independent contractors. Other major gig economy employers who together rely on tens of thousands of workers who do not benefit from sick pay, holiday pay and the right to a minimum wage are fighting similar claims that self-employed workers should have employment rights. Uber, the US taxi app company that has 40,000 drivers in the UK, will this September appeal against an employment tribunal verdict that some of them should be classed as workers. CitySprint has also launched an appeal after losing a similar case. Pimlico Plumbers lost an appeal in February. IWGB Courier Branch founding member Maggie Dewhurst, who won the claim against CitySprint, said: \u201cThe cruelty of the gig economy is clear for all to see in Demille\u2019s case. When he had an accident at work and broke his wrist he had to take time off with no holiday or sick pay.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Tesco boss's bonus cut despite first sales growth in seven years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Tesco, Dave Lewis, saw his pay package shrink last year despite leading the company to its first year of sales growth in seven years. The chief executive of Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain received \u00a34.15m last year, 10% less than his \u00a34.63m package a year earlier. Tesco\u2019s annual report, published on Friday, showed the fall was driven by a smaller bonus payout of \u00a32.4m for 2016-17, compared with \u00a33m in 2015-16. Lewis\u2019s annual salary remained at \u00a31.25m, and stays the same for the year ahead. The retailer\u2019s remuneration committee, which decides how much top executives should be paid, said the level of bonus paid to Lewis was based on how far he had met the \u201cstretching\u201d targets set for the year. The \u00a32.4m bonus was equivalent to 75.6% of his maximum annual bonus. Deanna Oppenheimer, chair of the remuneration committee, said Tesco had performed well in a tough year for retailers: \u201cTesco has had a year of strong progress, delivering against the three turnaround priorities of improving competitiveness in the UK, a more secure balance sheet and rebuilding trust, which were set in 2014. \u201cA stable platform has been established and a strong performance delivered in spite of significant external challenges, which made 2016-17 another challenging year for retailers.\u201d Tesco\u2019s finance director, Alan Stewart, was paid \u00a32.24m last year, 14% less than his \u00a32.6m pay package a year earlier. His salary was flat at 750,000 but his bonus fell to \u00a31.25m from \u00a31.6m in 2015-16. The annual report also revealed that Tesco paid \u00a3142,000 in stamp duty and legal fees to help Lewis buy a house closer to the company\u2019s headquarters in Hertfordshire. For much of the past decade Tesco has been losing customers to discount grocers Aldi and Lidl, but in the 112 months to the end of February, it managed its first full year of sales growth since 2009-10, with like-for-like sale up by 0.9%. Lewis was parachuted in to lead a turnaround of the supermarket giant in September 2014. Speaking as the annual report was published, Lewis said Tesco had made \u201cvery strong progress\u201d but there was still a lot of work to do. \u201cOver the last two and a half years we\u2019ve done a lot at Tesco, and I\u2019m personally very pleased with the progress that the team and the business is making. But we\u2019re also very clear that there\u2019s much much more that we want and can do to improve the business yet further.\u201d Supermarkets including Tesco are braced for a choppy year ahead, as the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote pushes up the price of imported foods and ingredients. Retailers will have to judge to what extent they are able to pass on the price rises to customers without damaging business. Daniel Ekstein, food retail analyst at UBS, said Tesco shoppers were seeing the lowest price inflation among its competitors. Inflation at the UK\u2019s major supermarkets was 1% year-on-year in April, according to UBS\u2019s regular pricing monitor. Tesco\u2019s basket of products tracked by UBS fell in price by 2.1%.",

Lewis\u2019s annual salary remained at \u00a31.25m, and stays the same for the year ahead. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/11/aldi-plans-uk-supermarket-for-every-30000-people\">Aldi plans to open up to eight stores in some UK towns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The retailer\u2019s remuneration committee, which decides how much top executives should be paid, said the level of bonus paid to Lewis was based on how far he had met the \u201cstretching\u201d targets set for the year. The \u00a32.4m bonus was equivalent to 75.6% of his maximum annual bonus.</p> <p>Deanna Oppenheimer, chair of the remuneration committee, said Tesco had performed well in a tough year for retailers: \u201cTesco has had a year of strong progress, delivering against the three turnaround priorities of improving competitiveness in the UK, a more secure balance sheet and rebuilding trust, which were set in 2014. </p> <p>\u201cA stable platform has been established and a strong performance delivered in spite of significant external challenges, which made 2016-17 another challenging year for retailers.\u201d</p> <p>Tesco\u2019s finance director, Alan Stewart, was paid \u00a32.24m last year, 14% less than his \u00a32.6m pay package a year earlier. His salary was flat at 750,000 but his bonus fell to \u00a31.25m from \u00a31.6m in 2015-16.</p> <p>The annual report also revealed that Tesco paid \u00a3142,000 in stamp duty and legal fees to help Lewis buy a house closer to the company\u2019s headquarters in Hertfordshire.</p> <p>For much of the past decade Tesco has been losing customers to discount grocers Aldi and Lidl, but in the 112 months to the end of February, it managed its first full year of sales growth since 2009-10, with like-for-like sale up by 0.9%. Lewis was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/01/tescos-new-boss-dave-lewis-shares\">parachuted in to lead a turnaround of the supermarket giant</a> in September 2014.</p> <p>Speaking as the annual report was published, Lewis said Tesco had made \u201cvery strong progress\u201d but there was still a lot of work to do. </p> <p>\u201cOver the last two and a half years we\u2019ve done a lot at Tesco, and I\u2019m personally very pleased with the progress that the team and the business is making. But we\u2019re also very clear that there\u2019s much much more that we want and can do to improve the business yet further.\u201d</p> <p> Supermarkets including Tesco are braced for a choppy year ahead, as the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote pushes up the price of imported foods and ingredients. Retailers will have to judge to what extent they are able to pass on the price rises to customers without damaging business. </p> <p>Daniel Ekstein, food retail analyst at UBS, said Tesco shoppers were seeing the lowest price inflation among its competitors. Inflation at the UK\u2019s major supermarkets was 1% year-on-year in April, according to UBS\u2019s regular pricing monitor. Tesco\u2019s basket of products tracked by UBS fell in price by 2.1%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Credit where it\u2019s due. After the accounting catastrophe in Italy and a big fine from Ofcom for overcharging for broadband access on the home front, BT\u2019s remuneration committee has done the decent thing. It has awarded no bonus to chief executive Gavin Patterson and the outgoing finance director. It has clawed back bonuses from both men for past years because the Italian scandal caused a \u00a3268m overstatement of profits. That penalty will cost Patterson \u00a3338,000. His incentive package for this year has also been reduced because the share price is 25% lower than a year ago. In a rational world, praise would be unnecessary. After BT\u2019s hellish year, any bonus would have been outrageous, as Patterson happily agreed. Yet too many other companies, confronted by equal share-price disasters for investors, fail to apply common sense. Elizabeth Corley, chair of Pearson\u2019s remuneration committee, should call her BT counterpart, Tony Ball, for a lesson in what using \u201cdiscretion\u201d means. Corley\u2019s crew dished out a \u00a3343,000 bonus to chief executive John Fallon after a year of record losses for the educational publisher, an astonishing decision that triggered a 60% revolt by shareholders. Corley herself suffered an embarrassing 27% vote against her re-election, but Ball can probably expect to be returned at BT with the usual Soviet-style majority. Once upon a time, Ball\u2019s own pay demands were deemed so excessive by ITV that the broadcaster dropped him as a candidate for chief executive. On this occasion, his hard-nosed approach was spot-on. To complete the package, BT will terminate PriceWaterhouseCoopers as auditor. The aim is to get a new firm in place next year, which resolves Patterson\u2019s previous odd vagueness about PwC\u2019s future. The auditor can\u2019t grumble. The alleged fraud in Italy, which was uncovered by investigators summoned from KPMG after a whistleblower\u2019s tip-off, may have been sophisticated but its size was enormous. It shouldn\u2019t happen at a large FTSE 100 company. The smack of firm governance will give BT\u2019s shareholders some comfort as they assess a year in which almost the only bright spot was the clean integration of mobile operator EE. The public sector market was weak, the global services division needs a job-cutting overhaul, and the TV business ended the year with a \u201csoft\u201d quarter. Overall, top-line operating profits were \u00a37.6bn, against an original goal of \u00a37.9bn, and this year\u2019s outcome could be \u00a37.5bn. The differences sound slight but they mean this year\u2019s dividend, while still being \u201cprogressive\u201d in the jargon, won\u2019t progress by the previously-promised 10%. The shares fell 4.5% to a whisker below 300p, a price seen as long ago as 2013. Non-shareholders, though, have reasons to be cheerful. Broadband business Openreach, where Ofcom has applied its own governance shake-up by insisting on legal separation and a separate board of directors, will consult with rivals on how to invest more in fast fibre networks that run to customers\u2019 doors. It\u2019s impossible to tell yet how much extra money could flow, but this is exactly the type of development the regulator wanted to see. As with Patterson\u2019s non-bonus and PwC\u2019s exit, it\u2019s what we expect. An interesting rate review Some say Mark Carney will never get the chance to raise interest rates during his term as governor of Bank of England, which is due to end in June 2019. The man himself clearly doesn\u2019t like the idea that the deliberations of the monetary policy committee will be a snooze-fest as far as the eye can see. Carney warned that interest rates may need to rise sooner than investors expect if inflation continues to overshoot its target and if the Brexit process is \u201csmooth\u201d. Well, yes, Carney\u2019s scenario is plausible. The Bank underestimated inflation slightly in the last three months and, for all the argy-bargy with Jean-Claude Juncker, the market still expects the UK and EU to agree a deal. A responsible governor must also give fair warning to those credit-happy consumers who have been spending merrily. Just don\u2019t expect the market to take much notice of the Bank\u2019s hawkish squawks. Forecasts for inflation in a year\u2019s time were revised down slightly in Thursday\u2019s report. Meanwhile, the Brexit uncertainty clouds everything. The consensus in the City is that it\u2019ll be at least a year before the debate over raising interest rates becomes truly interesting again. That sounds about right. \u2026 all the way to the prank We can all feel a little sorry for Barclays\u2019 Jes Staley for falling for the prank email purporting to be from his chairman, John McFarlane. Yes, there was a giveaway in the subject field \u2013 \u201cThe fool doth think he is wise\u201d \u2013 but the initial deceit was cutely done. The revelation in the exchange, however, was the degree of fawning gratitude that Staley was prepared to display after an annual shareholder meeting in which McFarlane came to the defence of his chief executive, who is under fire for seeking to unmask a whistleblower. \u201cYou came to my defense today with a courage not seen in many people,\u201d wrote Staley. \u201cHow do I thank you? You have a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humour with grit. Thank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect for your guile.\u201d Maybe the gushing language is an American thing. Or maybe Staley applied the lard because he thought that is what McFarlane might want to hear. But the tone jars. A chief executive who is quite so thankful for his own survival looks a little too insecure.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Just as Jes Staley, the embattled boss of Barclays, might have hoped to lie low after a gruelling confrontation with shareholders he is now facing fresh scrutiny. Email exchanges have emerged in which the American banker lavishes praise on the bank\u2019s chairman, John McFarlane, and thanks him for his support at the annual general meeting on Wednesday. But when Staley was responding to the emails by \u201cJohn McFarlane\u201d \u2013 sent under the subject line \u201cthe fool doth think he is wise\u201d \u2013 he did not appear to realise they were being sent by a prankster who has since made them public. Staley is gushing in his praise for McFarlane, who was instrumental in hiring the American in 2015, as a \u201cunique man\u201d. \u201cYou have a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humour with grit. Thank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect for your guile,\u201d Staley replied, to the email sent just after 8.45pm on Wednesday. The email exchange shows Staley being told \u201cyou owe me a large Scotch\u201d after the AGM, in which the chairman repeatedly defended the chief executive over the latter\u2019s attempts to unmask a whistleblower who had been making allegations about the previous conduct of a new recruit in the US. \u201cSome day I want to see an ad lib guitar run. You have all the fearlessness of Clapton,\u201d Staley said, referring to the guitarist Eric Clapton. McFarlane spent a large part of his career in Australia, where media dubbed him Johnny Hollywood in honour of his performing past and willingness to sing songs such as House of the Rising Sun at corporate and charity events. The email exchange, which ends just before 11pm, also includes an acrostic poem penned by the prankster. The first letter of each line spells out \u201cwhistleblower\u201d. \u201cThanks for sharing the foxhole\u201d is Staley\u2019s reply. Barclays declined to comment or give any clues to the reaction of Staley or McFarlane to the release of the email exchange. The prankster told the Financial Times he was in a battle with the bank over a customer issue and that he wanted to see \u201chow Jes was relaxing after his AGM\u201d. The chief executive had apologised at the AGM about his attempts to identify a whistleblower who was apparently making allegations about Tim Main, who worked with Staley at JP Morgan and who was recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June. \u201cI feel it is important that I acknowledge to you \u2013 our shareholders \u2013 that I made a mistake in becoming involved in an issue which I should have left to the business to deal with,\u201d Staley told shareholders. He may have now concluded that it was also a mistake to respond to the email from \u201cJohn McFarlane\u201d.",

You mix humour with grit. Thank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect for your guile,\u201d Staley replied, to the email sent just after 8.45pm on Wednesday.<br></p> <p>The email exchange shows Staley being told \u201cyou owe me a large Scotch\u201d after the AGM, <a href=\"http://the%20fool%20doth%20think%20he%20is%20wise/\">in which the chairman repeatedly defended the chief executive</a> over the latter\u2019s attempts to unmask a whistleblower who had been making allegations about the previous conduct of a new recruit in the US.</p> <p>\u201cSome day I want to see an<strong> </strong>ad lib guitar run.<strong> </strong>You have all the fearlessness of Clapton,\u201d Staley said, referring to the guitarist Eric Clapton.

The prankster told the Financial Times he was in a battle with the bank over a customer issue and that he wanted to see \u201chow Jes was relaxing after his AGM\u201d.</p> <p>The chief executive had apologised at the AGM about his attempts to identify a whistleblower who was apparently making allegations about Tim Main, who worked with Staley at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jpmorgan\">JP Morgan</a> and who was recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June.</p> <p>\u201cI feel it is important that I acknowledge to you \u2013 our shareholders \u2013 that I made a mistake in becoming involved in an issue which I should have left to the business to deal with,\u201d Staley told shareholders.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aldi has set out an ambitious plan to conquer the UK grocery market that could see it open up to eight stores in some towns. \u201cIf you look at the population, we think not only could we have a store in every town and city, but for every 25,000 to 30,000 people,\u201d said Matthew Barnes, the UK and Ireland chief executive of the German grocer. With the UK\u2019s population standing at 65 million that would equate to 2,600 stores \u2013 potentially quadrupling the size of the 700-store chain. Tesco currently has 2,700 UK outlets, from small Express shops to superstores. Aldi had set a target to reach 1,000 stores by 2022 but Barnes told the Grocer magazine the total could be closer to 1,300 by that date, and added: \u201cI think there is massively more potential than that.\u201d Barnes said: \u201cWe have 700 stores now and 300 sites already approved on our books. And there are 600 town locations where we don\u2019t have a store; in many of which we could easily have two, three or four stores ... We don\u2019t have a store in Watford, [but] that would be a six to eight Aldi town.\u201d Aldi opened its first UK store in Stechford, Birmingham, in 1990 but did not become a force to be reckoned with until the last recession, when both it and Lidl won over Britons struggling with their grocery bills at a time when food prices were soaring. Aldi overtook Waitrose in 2015 and in February moved past the Co-op to become the UK\u2019s fifth-biggest grocer. It is now sitting on a market share of 6.9% \u2013 meaning \u00a31 out of every \u00a314 spent in the UK on groceries goes into Aldi\u2019s tills \u2013 while Lidl is also making gains. Research group Kantar predicts Lidl could also overtake Waitrose this summer as the discounters benefit from new store openings and shoppers search out bargains amid a return to food price inflation. Aldi and Lidl are currently the fastest-growing grocery chains in the UK with sales rising at 18.3% and 17.8%, respectively, in the 12 weeks to 23 April, according to Kantar. Barnes said it would not let British shoppers \u201cfall out of love\u201d with Aldi, highlighting a business model \u201cthat enables us to survive off a much lower margin than anyone else\u201d. Last year Aldi reported a second consecutive year of falling profits after the price war it started ate into its own profitability. Operating profit dropped 1.8% to \u00a3255.6m in 2015 on sales of \u00a37.7bn. At the time Barnes said it would keep cutting prices to keep them below the likes of Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Morrisons, even \u201cif losses are an inevitable consequence\u201d. The scale of shoppers\u2019 defection to the discounters during the last recession forced chains such as Tesco and Morrisons to slash prices, shed staff and offload stores to shore up profits. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said there was plenty of \u201cheadroom\u201d in the UK market for Aldi to expand because \u201ca lot of people still can\u2019t shop in an Aldi as their local store\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "France's Engie aims to restore trust in energy firms with tracker tariff", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A French power company has promised to restore trust in the energy market with a new tracker tariff linked to wholesale prices, days after big suppliers were found to be making record profit margins from their customers. Engie, which describes itself as the biggest new entrant to the UK domestic energy market in 15 years, said it was the right time for the company to launch in Britain, despite both the Conservatives and Labour planning price caps on energy bills. \u201cWe invest because regardless of any political context, this is something that makes sense,\u201d said Wilfrid Petrie, Engie\u2019s UK chief executive. The company, formerly known as GDF Suez, arrives in the UK this week alongside two small new energy companies, taking the total of domestic suppliers to a record 52. The number is set to keep rising: regulator Ofgem said it expected to grant licences for a further six suppliers in June and July. Engie hopes to stand out by offering scale, transparency, green credentials and additional services, such as installing smart thermostats in people\u2019s homes. Unusually, the supplier promises that when its fixed tariffs come to an end, customers will be moved to its cheapest deal, rather than following the industry practice of rolling people on to pricier default tariffs. Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, said this \u2018rollover promise\u2019 was the most interesting part of Engie\u2019s pitch, and would allow customers to: \u201cget a long-term, relatively cheap tariff, without doing much.\u201d But he said the baseline for the tariff was key. \u201cIf you move onto the cheapest of four not-cheap products it\u2019s all nonsense anyway.\u201d Petrie said he hoped to attract a few hundred thousand customers, but refused to put a timeline on the goal, adding: \u201cThere are no hard targets we set ourselves.\u201d Engie has gained 15,000 domestic customers since a soft launch in December. Petrie insisted the company was committed to the UK despite the threat of price regulation and said it could carve out a niche. \u201c[The UK is] highly scrutinised, the players are criticised and the image is not particularly good, and there is a market with a lot of competition,\u201d he said. Alongside conventional fixed deals, the cheapest of which costs \u00a3880 a year, Engie will launch a tracker tariff this summer that goes up or down each month depending on the cost of wholesale gas and electricity. The company said 40% of the tariff paid by consumers would be made up of wholesale costs, with the rest of the tariff comprising costs from government policy, the transmission network and profits. \u201cThose wholesale price changes are passed on. Unfortunately, it\u2019s the good and the bad \u2013 they could go up, they could go down,\u201d said Paul Rawson, the firm\u2019s head of energy solutions. \u201cI think it\u2019s a new innovation, and a new ability for customers to get real price transparency and restore a bit of trust in the industry.\u201d The tracker follows a similar wholesale tracker tariff launched on Monday by Octopus Energy, another relatively new challenger supplier that signed up 90,000 customers in its first year. Engie will also be competing with a pair of new entrants that launched this week, including Pure Planet, which claims it will be one of the cheapest suppliers of renewable energy on the market, with a single tariff of around \u00a3900. BP owns a quarter of the company, set up by four friends who founded Virgin Mobile in 1999, and is also the producer of the wind, solar and hydro power that the company is buying. The other new entrant is People\u2019s Energy, which raised \u00a3450,000 via a crowdfunding campaign and pledges to return 75% of its profits to customers each year in an annual rebate.",
