      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund is closely monitoring recent events in the world's emerging markets amid concerns that the withdrawal of monetary stimulus by the US will add to the turmoil caused by the sudden slump in Argentina. The IMF believes that the next phase of the gradual removal of stimulus to the US economy by the Federal Reserve, due later this week, could be the trigger for fresh turbulence in countries seen as vulnerable to capital flight, such as Turkey and Indonesia. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, told participants at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the so-called tapering by the US central bank was a potential problem. \"This is clearly a new risk on the horizon and it needs to be closely watched,\" Lagarde said. \"How tapering takes place, at what speed, how it is communicated and what spillover effects it has, particularly in emerging markets.\" Markets sold off on Friday after the Argentinian peso had its biggest one-day fall since 2002. Larry Fink, chairman of fund manager BlackRock, told the WEF that one of his concerns was the large positions held by investors in various emerging markets. Fink added that tapering was not the main problem. \"It's going to require much better domestic policy in these emerging markets,\" he said. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said the UK economy was one-fifth smaller than had the \"great recession\" of 2008-09 never happened. He said stronger banks and less indebted consumers meant the UK was now in better shape, but listed an array of weaknesses that would inhibit the Bank raising interest rates. He said UK banks might need to build up their defences against further problems. \"As good as the numbers have been in the last three quarters, we're talking about household-driven growth, where the economy is 20% below its pre-crisis trend level, that has not yet rebalanced and is still vulnerable to problems in its neighbour [the eurozone].\" Carney indicated that the UK would impose tougher rules on its banks than those agreed internationally. \"I do think home markets in several cases, including the UK, need to supplement them as appropriate.\" Meanwhile, the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said he was prepared to use all possible weapons to avoid the eurozone sinking into Japanese-style deflation. Interest rates could be cut from their already low level if necessary. Draghi was speaking shortly after senior eurozone finance ministers were forced to defend the plans intended to avoid eurozone banking failures after Lord Turner, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, raised concerns about their effectiveness. Turner said that while a collapse of a large bank was less likely than in the past, the eurozone needed to know how to handle a bank that needs more capital after stress tests conducted this year. \"You've got to be able to put in public capital and that's the resolution fund. The big danger for the eurozone over the next 10 years is that until that fund is in place you are still running a risk,\" Turner said. He provoked a strong reaction from Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, and his Dutch counterpart Jereon Dijsselbloem, who is also president of the group of eurozone finance ministers, who insisted the European Stability Mechanism could be used to bail out banks. Following criticism that stress tests of banks in the past have not been tough enough, Dijsselbloem said he hoped that problems were uncovered. \"I rather hope it will unveil some unpleasantness, as that will give me a good feeling that is being done properly,\" the Dutch minister said. Sch\u00e4uble admitted that he had wanted the ESM \u2013 to be \u00a355bn in 10 years \u2013 to be bigger and kept up the pressure for structural reform in the French and Italian economies after progress made by Spain, Ireland and Portugal. Turner exposed differences with Sch\u00e4uble by making references to the way the US had tackled in banking system, forcing banks to take bailouts if they could not raise money on their own. \"We are not the United States of America, we are not the United States of Europe were are the European Union, quite complicated by we are rather successive,\" Schauble said. On a panel discussing what impact technological changes were having on the workforce, Larry Summers, now a professor at Harvard, said: \"We pay people too much not to work and not enough to work.\" Philip Jennings, who runs the UNI Global Unioncorrect, praised the Bank of England for using unemployment as a guide for the next rate rise. \"It's changed the narrative,\" he said.",

currency.</p> </blockquote> <p>Schauble then declares that the&#xa0;most successful nations are those who have been under a reform&#xa0;programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Portugal is&#xa0;doing very well,&#xa0;Spain is&#xa0;doing extremely well,&#xa0;Greece did better than we expected,&#xa0;Cyprus is doing very well.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on banking union, Schauble says that good progress has been made, within the context that we&#xa0;are constricted by the current treaty.&#xa0;</p> <p>This means we have taken decisions for a common European banking supervision, harmonised rules for savings, agreed clear rules for restructuring.<br></p> <p>And we agreed a single resolution fund that will be funded by the banks itself --Schauble continues (although he can only

      "bodyText": "The WEF 2014 ended with delegates being treated to a virtuoso performance of a piece called \"Leap\", before being exalted to do what they can to improve the state of the world. Biznews editor Alec Hogg (who hasn't had to scarper for the flight back to London) has the details. You can see it here. And with that, best wishes from Switzerland, and goodnight. Earlier today, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook reminded Davos delegates that women are still treated differently in the workplace - eliciting a sea of raised hands when asking which women had ever been asked \"why are you working?\". Only two men responded to the same question. And the Telegraph's Szu Ping Chan flags up another astonishing line: Bet Christine Lagarde's first boss feels a bit chastened today... Christine Lagarde has told Davos that getting more women into the labour market is essential to drive growth: Japan's PM has already got the message - promising to get 30% of top jobs into female hands by 2020 to help drive its recovery Japan's central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, gets the last word: We can be cautiously optimistic about the global economic outlook, he says. The US economy is likely to grow by 3% this year Europe is finally growing Japan is making significant progress. And emerging markets are likely to maintain growth rates at high level, or accelerate. We must be cautious, and be aware of down Wolf thanks him for giving his summing up for him (make a change from questioners giving the answers, I guess),and then reassures the audience that while the panel was optimistic, they weren't optimistic enough to actually be dangerous. And that's the end. The panel end with a quick discussion about bank regulation, in which Schauble suggests: \"In a globalised world, we will need more regulation -- both of financial markets and non-financial markets\" Christine Lagarde takes a question on tapering - pointing out that the flow of capital out of emerging markets has not been that great, so far. And she adds that some countries have suffered much less capital exit than others. Investors are \"very cunning\" -- they will look at a country's government, policy mix, etc, to assess whether to put money in, or take it out. Now Wolfgang Schauble is asked whether there is more chance of collective debt, or eurobonds, in the euro area now that there is a new German government with a large majority. No. Schauble argues that it would be the end of any hope of pushing through the \"uncomfortable but needed structural reforms\" that the eurozone needs. Without a treaty change (that would bring in tighter fiscal controls), eurobonds cannot happen, he says, because it is essential that countries in Europe fix and improve their economies. So it helps if they're all on the verge of bankrupcy, says Wolf (who is a leading critic of eurozone austerity). You can help us create a new treaty, and allow a new fiscal policy if you like, Schauble hits back. Wolf suggests the UK wouldn't be happy about such a treaty. A few questions. Asked why the US dollar is so weak when the US economy is so strong, Fink argues that the Fed's huge stimulus programme swamped all other central bank efforts. He expect to see a much weaker euro, especially if the ECB takes new stimulus measures this year. OK, now it's Lawrence Fink, head of BlackRock, says we are entering a world of much higher volatility, and while that isn't a bad thing in itself \"there will be disruptions\", warning. \"We've been used to very calm equity markets for the last three years\" He also warned that governments need to crack on with structural reforms, both in the developed and developing world. \ufeffIt is very hard to tell men and women, whether in India or in Italy, that it's harder to get a job. Fink also claims that governments are too willing to blame Fed tapering for their problems, when often bad government is to blame. Governments are very happy when capital rushes in, but they shout about capitalism when capital rushes out. On forward guidance, Carney acknowledges that the jobless rate will soon hit the 7% threshold he set before he'd consider raising interest rates. The Bank of England will assess its policy, he confirms (something pledged earlier this week), looking at issues like the broader health of the labour market. Carney then makes the argument that any tightening (when it comes) would be \"gradual\", because \"As good as the numbers have been in the last three quarters\", we're talking about house-hold driven growth, that is below capacity, that has not yet rebalanced,and which is still vulnerable to problems at its neighbour (the eurozone), Carney says. Exceptional monetary policy is still relevant, he concludes. Now onto Mark Carney to talk about the UK economy, and the recent marked pick-up. He cites three factors: Households have been repaying debts at an impressive rate. The core of the financial system has been repaired, mainly thanks to his predessor's work. UK banks have raised 140bn pounds of fresh capital since the crisis,out of 500bn dollars raised by all banks. And a reduction in uncertainty. Carney cites a quote which says \"Confidence grows at the speed of the coconut tree, and falls at the speed of the coconut\". \"The slow growth of the coconut tree in the UK\", helped by the situation in Europe, and in monetary policy terms low interest rates and his own forward guidance, have helped. . Japan's central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda,\u0016says that the country's Abenomics programme (one of the most exciting innovations in central banking in years). Kuroda says that Japan is halfway to getting inflation up to its 2% target, and believes it should be there within two years time. Abenomics as a whole is making progress, and monetary policy target is making good progress. And he warns that Japan saw the perils of deflation in the past,when people's inflation expectations dwindled, pushing prices down. That meant: Innovation was not very strong, investment in fixed assets and human capital was very slow. Alhuwalia touches on the US Federal Reserve's tapering programme. There will be spillover effects, he says, hopefully they will be managed. Alhuwalia is also encouraged by Mario Draghi's point that other central banks could step in if markets reacted badly to the end of the Fed's bond-buying programme. Now Montek Singh Alhuwalia, deputy chair of India's planning committee , who says he shares Christine Lagarde's cautious optimism. China may have slowed down, but it's still growing at above the official target (7.7% I think). He says that some of India's slowdown, from 8% growth per year to 5%, is because of domestic economic problems. We have run into domestic structural restraints, Alhuwalia says, citing \"environmental activism\" and \"legal activism\" for causing many large projects to slow down. We're reacting by offering more permits, Alhuwalia says, but the key is to change the system to make it easier to get projects going, \"and that's going to happen\". Onto Wolfgang Schauble, who says that the eurozone's challenge is that it has one currency but 18 different countries in different situations. We must avoid wrong incentives, because the temptation not to stick to the necessary fiscal and structural policies is very high. Europe is no longer the main worry, Schuable says: We have regained confidence that the euro will remain an important currency. Schauble then declares that the most successful nations are those who have been under a reform programme: Portugal is doing very well, Spain is doing extremely well, Greece did better than we expected, Cyprus is doing very well. And on banking union, Schauble says that good progress has been made, within the context that we are constricted by the current treaty. This means we have taken decisions for a common European banking supervision, harmonised rules for savings, agreed clear rules for restructuring. And we agreed a single resolution fund that will be funded by the banks itself --Schauble continues (although he can only force German banks to chip in - it's up to each nation to manage its own sector). And we mustn't weaken on structural reforms, Schauble concludes. We are ready to use all the instruments allowed by our Treaty to fight deflation, Draghi concludes. Martin Wolf seeks more guidance.... Draghi acknowledges that there's a lot of interest in whether the ECB could launch a quantitative easing programme. But he points out that sovereigns and banks are issuing more bonds today -- so there is no need to offer help there. So what do you buy? He suggests that an asset that would package bank loans in the right way. (which could then be traded in the markets,and potentially bought by the ECB). Onto Draghi - with inflation so low (just 0.8%), is your monetary policy a failure? Draghi replies that inflation will probably be below target (close to but below 2%) for the next two years, and remain at the low end of its target for an extended period. Some is due to low price of energy and food -- if you look at core inflation in the US it's not that much different. And core inflation levels are similar to after the Asian crisis and the Lehman crisis -- suggesting this is a phenomenon after a crisis. Draghi repeats a point he made last night - Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus are mainly responsible. Lagarde's second \"R\" is Reset. Stimulus measures launched by central bankers should not be unwound until recoveries are well underway. And governments must implement structural reforms -- not in just advanced developed countries, but in some developing nations too. Christine Lagarde says we face old risks, and new risks. The old risks include that unbalances between economies could widen again. The tapering of the US 's stimulus programme is a key new risk - how it is communicated, how it is implemented, and what the impact on the rest of the world is. This is clearly a new risk on the horizon,and it needs to be clearly watched. And her other new risk is deflation. No-one could argue that inflation in the eurozone is below the ECB's 2% target, she says. The danger is that inflation expectations could fall if inflation remains below target for an extended time. And that's why the IMF has flagged up deflation as a possible risk. Wolf says that the background today is optimism,but with real concerns. Growth forecasts have been raised recently, but there emerging market concerns, exchange rate volatility, China's rebalancing act. Draghi has to leave early, so the session will start with Europe and then move onto the bits of the world economy that actually shows decent growth, jokes Martin Wolf. Oops - Wolfgang Schauble is also on the panel It's a bigname panel: Japan's central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda - the most exciting central banker in the world, says Martin Wolf of the FT who will chairing the session. Mark Carney Christine Lagarde Montek Singh Alhuwalia deputy chair of India's planning committee Lawrence Fink, head of Blackrock Mario Draghi of the ECB OK, now the big session on the Global Economic Outlook -- here's the livestream. Winnie Byanyima, Oxfam's executive director, has told us that many business people at Davos have woken up to unfairness caused by the financial crisis, and that inequality is bad for their economic prospects too. Byanyima said: Following the financial and economic crisis, austerity measure in Europe have hit the poorest hardest, taking away essential services from them. On the other hand, the rich have got away scot-free, with bailouts that helped the banks and big investors. This is a clear rigging of the rules. The policies that should help everybody are helping the rich more than the poor, in a crisis that was caused by the rich. It is political capture of wealth and power - the wealthy capturing political power and influencing policy in their favour. And I didn't get any rich person here challenging me on that. Clearly showing that they see it. They see the injustice of it. The other thing I tried to show them is that it is clearly not in their economic interest, she added. That message is also coming from mainstream institutions like the OECB and the World Bank, taking about inequality and the damage it does to growth. It's really the issue of today, it's really not a fringe issue by crazy NGOs, Byanyima concluded. Oxfam is also pushing companies hard on transparency at Davos -- some, she warned, are talking the talk on fighting inequality but not yet walking the walk. Schauble ends the session on a gloomy note: We must resist \"excessive optimism\" today. I believe that things were not as bad they looked at the time [of the crisis], and they are not as good as they look for some people [today]. Now they're summing up, with Lord Turner repeating that Europe has \"woken up to the idea that a currency union needs a banking union\", but needs to finish the job properly. I'm not denying that progress has been made - but we will need further banking union. He adds: By doing it without treaty changes, a series of complimses have been made\u2026 we could do to get a bit closer to perfection. Wolfgang Schauble says Europe must not rely too much on monetary policy -- we must fight for structural reforms,he says. And he also touches on one of the themes of Davos -- inequality -- saying: We have to avoid too much inequality, otherwise we will fail. In this world of communications, everyone can see \u2013 before not everyone say, and that makes the stability of the political system much more fragile. Anshu Jain, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, says lending to SMEs will not recover until there is clarity about issues such as leverage ratio -- urging finance ministers to reach agreements soon. Into questions, and Olli Rehn is asked about whether France and Italy are doing enough to improve their economies. France has recently announced a wide-ranging programme of reforms, now the government has to implement it, says the EC commissioner. And we are looking forward to Italy using its new stability to launch a bold reform programme Spain, Ireland, and Portugal have all made significant structural progress in recent years -- \"Now it's time for France and Italy to follow suit. Is the 55bn euro fund which Europe has agreed to set up for struggling banks big enough? Wolfgang Schauble says he wanted a larger fund, but others want a smaller one. Schauble also says he agrees with Adair Turner that Europe need treaty changes, although that can be difficult to get through. And Dijsselbloem reiterates that there are three lines of defence for a bank which fails the stress tests. 1) They can go to the markets for more funds 2) They can apply to national resolution funds -- national backstops, which would mean some creditors are bailed-in. 3) they could then access the European funds (back in November, there was agreement that the ESM fund could be the ultimate backstop) Wolfgang Schauble points out that creditors will also be bailed-in before taxpaper money is used to recapitalise European banks. Lord Turner has clashed with the finance ministers on the panel, saying that Europe needs a proper backstop in place, soon, for its banks. The US bank stress tests in 2009 worked because banks knew that they had a fixed date Problem with European stress tests in 2010 is we couldn't say what would happen if you failed, he says. There is much less chance of a really big European bank failing...but you can't shut one down because it will scare the markets, Turner says. If banks cannot raise funds elsewhere then you need to be able to put in public capital, he says -- Until that fund is in place, you're still running a risk. [to clarify, the eurozone govenments have agreed to build up a fund, but it won't be completed for 10 years] Jeroen Dijsselbloem hits back, saying: It's not unclear. Banks that are unviable will have to be shut down. If a bank fails they have set time to raise funds, and if they can't they can go to their governments. There's only one rule - state aid rules apply. Turner responds: Can they get funding from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) (the main bailout fund)? Dijsselbloem says the eurogroup is working on rules for direct recapitalision of banks, with strict conditionality, as a last step. If a bank applied for ESM help before 2016, there would be a deep bail-in of creditors, he concludes. In the past, national regulators had an incentive to not fail their banks, says Olli Rehn. This time it's different, as the ECB's supervisor is taking the lead and will test the banks hard. \ufeffI'm sure Mario [Draghi] does not want a big chunk of  impaired banks in his hands -- i could use a worse word, but I don't want to here. Lord Turner saying that he hopes the ECB's stress tests will be credible, and believes they will be. He points out that previous stress tests of European banks weren't convincing, partly because if you'd marked assets to market accurately during the height of the crisis then some banks would have gone under. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup (and also the Dutch finance minister), says he hopes that some bad news will come out of the ECB's stress tests. \ufeffI rather hope that it will unveil some unpleasantness, as that will give me a good feeling that it is being done properly. Unicredit's CEO, Federico Ghizzoni, agrees that the tests will need some bad news to persuade the markets. Wolfgang Schauble responds to Lord Turner's call for rapid banking union, saying that it is \"always a pleasure\" to hear people from the UK tell him that Europe needs to be more like America. \"We are not the United States of America, we are not the United States of Europe, we are the European Union - quite complicated , but we are rather successful\", the German finance minister insists. Now Lord Adair Turner warns that the European Asset Quality review probably won't unleash a lot of extra lending -- arguing that the lack of borrowing is due to demand problems as well as supply problems. Turner says euro countries must implement further changes: \ufeffI fundamentally believe that for the eurozone to work, it has to go to a fairly deep level of federalisation which will requite a treaty specific to the eurozone - I'm slightly out of line with most British opinion on that. Need full banking union, Turner adds - making the comparison with America. There's no way Americans would tolerate an Illinois bank account being covered by a Illinois fund, he says.. Olli Rehn, European Commissioner, points out that a \"critical reason\" in America's more rapid recovery is that it tackled its banking problems much sooner than Europe. Unicredit's CEO, Federico Ghizzoni, says that he hopes that the upcoming Asset Quality Review will let Italian banks deal with their remaining problems. The session starts with Anshu Jain, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, saying We've come an enormous difference in a very short time. Must pay tribute to French and German government, and the ECB, he says, for this progress. But a lot remains to be done -- Europe needs to implement the single supervisory mechanism and banking union. And crucially, Jain, says, banks are still too weak. We still aren't where we should be --banks aren't able to create capital as quickly as the economy needs. Heads-up: the debate on rebuilding Europe's banking sector is about to start. It's being streamed live here. On the circular economy panel,Stanford professor William McDonough argues that the term 'sustainable' simply lacks passion. Suppose your wife asked you about the state of your relationship, and you said \"it's sustainable\"..... I don't know that I'd get a lot further by saying it's circular, shoots back Ali Velshi of Al Jazeera. Heads-up: Dame Ellen MacArthur is appearing on a panel on\"From Waste to Wealth\", outlining her vision of a circular economy. Rather than today's \"take, make and dispose\" economy, it is based on a more sustainable approach. A report yesterday argued it could create $1tn in annual savings by 2025 and 100,000 new jobs within five years. There's strong evidence that a circular economy can generate faster economic growth, and new jobs, she says. Other panelists are agreeing that dwindling natural resources means companies need to take a circular approach. Frans van Houten, CEO of Royal Phillips, warned: The e-waste is enormous in this world. There's more gold coming out of e-waste than out of the mines. Livestream here. My colleague Jo Confino wrote about the idea of a Circular Economy here, yesterday. Davos delegates were in two minds when asked whether technology was driving joblessness up. Asked to vote following this morning's session (see here onwards), they were split down the middle: Larry Summers, now a professor at Harvard, painted a bleak picture of the world of the work \u2013 not because of technology, but because of changes to the economy. Summers looked at the age bracket 25-64 to show that in 1965 one in 20 men were out of work and predicted that one in seven will not be working in 2017/8, assuming a full recovery. \u201cThis is nearly a tripling of the rate of non-work,\u201d said Summers (on a panel on the impact of technology on employment). \u201cWe pay people too much not to work and not enough to work,\u201d Summers said, in reference to unemployment benefits. But he said it was not easy to say which white or blue collar jobs would be affected most. \" It is very problematic to say which jobs are going to susceptible to modernisation.\" The places where the jobs are getting replaced by technology is not where the geographical tensions are high today, he added. Erik Brynjoffsson of MIT argued that the whole work of education needs to be rethought, with the old -fashioned way of sitting in rows being replaced by something that fosters creativity. \u201cRobots are very good at following instructions by rote,\u201d Brynjoffsson said. Philip Jennings, who runs the unions' union, UNI, called for a new social contract and also welcomed the decision by Bank of England governor Mark Carney to focus interest rate movements on unemployment, and the move by the US central bank the Federal Reserve. \"It's changing the narrative,\u201d Jennings said. (via my colleague Jill Treanor) What impact is technology on the world of work? Is it the cause of the jobless recovery? Are white and blue collar jobs being replaced by no collar jobs? A passionate debate took place on these issues earlier today, with the trade minister of Indonesia, Gita Wirjawan, saying he hopes that technology will allow mobile handset to be made in his country \u2013 an idea knocked down by an academic, who pointed out that Mac Pros are made in Austin Texas. \u201cLow wages are no protection,\u201d said Erik Brynjoffsson of MIT, in response to Indonesia's Gita Wirjawan. The scene earlier today: Hello. It's the final day of the World Economic Forum here in Davos, and we'll be covering the highlights for most of the day. After three hectic days, there's a quieter feel to Davos this morning. But there are still several interesting sessions coming up, including: 12.30pm CET/11.30am GMT: Rebuilding banking in Europe, with Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, French finance minister Pierre Moscovici, Germany's Wolfgang Schauble, and Lord Adair Turner 2pm CET/1pm GMT: The Global Economic Outlook 2014, with three of the four top central bankers -Mark Carney, Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda. 3.30pm CET/2.30pm GMT: Gender driven growth, with Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Christine Lagarde of the IMF You can also watch many of the events on WEF's own site, here.",

      "body": "<p>Unemployment is falling, growth has returned, economic forecasts are rosier. And Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is reassuring everybody that interest rates are staying down, despite the rapidly improving jobs data. Expect Janet Yellen, new head of the US Federal Reserve, to be similarly dovish. Big business must be feeling bullish, right?</p> <p>Not exactly. It has been hard to spot the arrival of warmer weather in 2014's first batch of reports from major FTSE 100 companies.</p> <p>We've had Shell's first profits warning for a decade. Unilever said \"developed markets remained weak with little sign of any overall improvement.\" Pearson, the education group, issued a mild profits warning this week and said its US&#xa0;market is \"still challenging.\"</p> <p>Or note a line in Terry Smith's report to investors in his Fundsmith fund, which is skewed towards international companies in the field of consumer staples. In Fundsmith's \"investable universe\" of 64 stocks, Smith said there is \"no doubt\" that the rate of underlying revenue growth \"has slowed by a couple of percentage points over the past year\".</p> <p>On a similar track, Andrew Lapthorne, an analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, pointed out recently that in the US there is a large gap between \"pro forma\" earnings \u2013 which allow certain items to be excluded \u2013 and the harder measure of reported earnings. The former shows growth of 6%-7% in 2013; the latter almost zero.</p> <p>It would also be wrong, Lapthorne suggests, to trust the idea that companies have been under-investing while sitting on large piles of cash they will soon unleash to fuel growth. In fact, says Lapthorne, companies' accounts show capital expenditure in the US already running at almost 7% of sales, high by historical standards. And the cash piles must be set against the debts, some of which have been accumulated to fund share buybacks. Levels of net debt among US non-financial companies, he calculates, are actually 15% higher than before the financial crisis. The UK picture is similar.</p> <p>The magic ingredient driving last year's buoyancy in stock markets was, of course, quantitative easing. The policy has encouraged investors into shares and, by lowering corporate bond yields, has allowed finance directors to play the share buyback game with cheaper debt.</p> <p>More monetary medicine, notwithstanding the Fed's softly-softly \"taper\" on QE, could keep the stock market party swinging for a lot longer yet. But 2014 has brought disappointing profit and revenue news from the frontline of international business. That is a new development. If a currency crisis in emerging markets is also brewing, the global recovery could start to look very weak. Stock markets, priced for growth, are fragile.</p> <p>Still, there's nothing like a few flotations to keep spirits high, eh? They are the life-blood of equity markets, we're always told, and one fund manager at a major house confides that he's seeing half a dozen companies a week wanting to gauge investors' appetites.</p> <p>That should be a cue to study closely the quality of some of these hopefuls. Just Eat, reports the FT, is hoping to list at a value of \u00a3700m-\u00a3900m, or 70 to 90 times its profits before interest, tax and depreciation, on the basis that it is a \"technology\" company.</p> <p>What? Just Eat allows punters to order a takeaway pizza, curry, or whatever, over the internet and via a mobile phone. That might have been cutting-edge innovation circa 1999 but, come on, this is still a delivery service, even if it has employed the mighty JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs as advisers.</p> <p>At 70-90 times earnings, skip this meal and start worrying about what else the supposedly exciting pipeline of flotations will offer.</p> <p>It seems only yesterday that Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene, doing her bit to help business secretary Vince Cable, was arguing that the privatisation of the postal service was executed well and that a long-term view should be taken of the share price.</p> <p>Follow this line to its conclusion and Royal Mail's status as a FTSE 100 company shouldn't be taken for granted. At the current share price of 575p, or \u00a35.75bn in terms of market value, the group is easily within the blue-chip pack. But at the float price of 330p, or even 400p, it would be a borderline candidate.</p> <p>It was jarring, therefore, to hear chairman Donald Brydon argue this week that, now Royal Mail is a member of the FTSE 100 index, Greene ought to be paid more. She is the \"lowest paid chief executive in the FTSE 100,\" he told the Daily Telegraph, and he wants to \"right-size her a bit\" as \"a necessary part of making sure we keep her\".</p> <p>What sort of right-sizing, if we must call it that, does he have in mind? Brydon didn't say. But the most Greene can currently earn under the \"reward scenarios\" set out in the annual report is \u00a31.72m. The boss of a typical \u00a36bn FTSE 100 firm might expect to be dangled a carrot twice that size.</p> <p>So does Brydon's \"a bit\" imply a doubling of Greene's package? That might a tricky pitch when the chancellor is advocating a \"recovery for all.\" Royal Mail would be giving its workers a 9% pay increase over three years while potentially handing the boss 100% in one year. On the other hand, Adam Crozier, Greene's predecessor, collected \u00a32.4m in his final year.</p> <p>Cable will find himself at the centre of this tale. The state still owns 30% of Royal Mail and the staff have 10%. That combination could amount to a blocking stake since, under Cable's own reforms, executive pay proposals must be put to a shareholder vote at the annual meeting. Brydon, an experienced operator, will not wish to advance a package that risks being shot down.</p> <p>It's a delicious tangle. Let's hope Cable doesn't avoid it by flogging the state's remaining shares before Royal Mail's annual meeting, which is set for the summer. The government is free to sell from mid-April.</p> <p>Some may feel that Jamie Dimon received an enormous bonus when he kept his job as chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan Chase after the \"London whale\" fiasco.

      "bodyText": "Unemployment is falling, growth has returned, economic forecasts are rosier. And Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is reassuring everybody that interest rates are staying down, despite the rapidly improving jobs data. Expect Janet Yellen, new head of the US Federal Reserve, to be similarly dovish. Big business must be feeling bullish, right? Not exactly. It has been hard to spot the arrival of warmer weather in 2014's first batch of reports from major FTSE 100 companies. We've had Shell's first profits warning for a decade. Unilever said \"developed markets remained weak with little sign of any overall improvement.\" Pearson, the education group, issued a mild profits warning this week and said its US market is \"still challenging.\" Or note a line in Terry Smith's report to investors in his Fundsmith fund, which is skewed towards international companies in the field of consumer staples. In Fundsmith's \"investable universe\" of 64 stocks, Smith said there is \"no doubt\" that the rate of underlying revenue growth \"has slowed by a couple of percentage points over the past year\". On a similar track, Andrew Lapthorne, an analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, pointed out recently that in the US there is a large gap between \"pro forma\" earnings \u2013 which allow certain items to be excluded \u2013 and the harder measure of reported earnings. The former shows growth of 6%-7% in 2013; the latter almost zero. It would also be wrong, Lapthorne suggests, to trust the idea that companies have been under-investing while sitting on large piles of cash they will soon unleash to fuel growth. In fact, says Lapthorne, companies' accounts show capital expenditure in the US already running at almost 7% of sales, high by historical standards. And the cash piles must be set against the debts, some of which have been accumulated to fund share buybacks. Levels of net debt among US non-financial companies, he calculates, are actually 15% higher than before the financial crisis. The UK picture is similar. The magic ingredient driving last year's buoyancy in stock markets was, of course, quantitative easing. The policy has encouraged investors into shares and, by lowering corporate bond yields, has allowed finance directors to play the share buyback game with cheaper debt. More monetary medicine, notwithstanding the Fed's softly-softly \"taper\" on QE, could keep the stock market party swinging for a lot longer yet. But 2014 has brought disappointing profit and revenue news from the frontline of international business. That is a new development. If a currency crisis in emerging markets is also brewing, the global recovery could start to look very weak. Stock markets, priced for growth, are fragile. Still, there's nothing like a few flotations to keep spirits high, eh? They are the life-blood of equity markets, we're always told, and one fund manager at a major house confides that he's seeing half a dozen companies a week wanting to gauge investors' appetites. That should be a cue to study closely the quality of some of these hopefuls. Just Eat, reports the FT, is hoping to list at a value of \u00a3700m-\u00a3900m, or 70 to 90 times its profits before interest, tax and depreciation, on the basis that it is a \"technology\" company. What? Just Eat allows punters to order a takeaway pizza, curry, or whatever, over the internet and via a mobile phone. That might have been cutting-edge innovation circa 1999 but, come on, this is still a delivery service, even if it has employed the mighty JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs as advisers. At 70-90 times earnings, skip this meal and start worrying about what else the supposedly exciting pipeline of flotations will offer. It seems only yesterday that Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene, doing her bit to help business secretary Vince Cable, was arguing that the privatisation of the postal service was executed well and that a long-term view should be taken of the share price. Follow this line to its conclusion and Royal Mail's status as a FTSE 100 company shouldn't be taken for granted. At the current share price of 575p, or \u00a35.75bn in terms of market value, the group is easily within the blue-chip pack. But at the float price of 330p, or even 400p, it would be a borderline candidate. It was jarring, therefore, to hear chairman Donald Brydon argue this week that, now Royal Mail is a member of the FTSE 100 index, Greene ought to be paid more. She is the \"lowest paid chief executive in the FTSE 100,\" he told the Daily Telegraph, and he wants to \"right-size her a bit\" as \"a necessary part of making sure we keep her\". What sort of right-sizing, if we must call it that, does he have in mind? Brydon didn't say. But the most Greene can currently earn under the \"reward scenarios\" set out in the annual report is \u00a31.72m. The boss of a typical \u00a36bn FTSE 100 firm might expect to be dangled a carrot twice that size. So does Brydon's \"a bit\" imply a doubling of Greene's package? That might a tricky pitch when the chancellor is advocating a \"recovery for all.\" Royal Mail would be giving its workers a 9% pay increase over three years while potentially handing the boss 100% in one year. On the other hand, Adam Crozier, Greene's predecessor, collected \u00a32.4m in his final year. Cable will find himself at the centre of this tale. The state still owns 30% of Royal Mail and the staff have 10%. That combination could amount to a blocking stake since, under Cable's own reforms, executive pay proposals must be put to a shareholder vote at the annual meeting. Brydon, an experienced operator, will not wish to advance a package that risks being shot down. It's a delicious tangle. Let's hope Cable doesn't avoid it by flogging the state's remaining shares before Royal Mail's annual meeting, which is set for the summer. The government is free to sell from mid-April. Some may feel that Jamie Dimon received an enormous bonus when he kept his job as chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan Chase after the \"London whale\" fiasco. The derivatives debacle, initially dismissed by Dimon as a fuss about nothing, ended up costing the bank $6bn (\u00a33.6bn). But the directors of JP Morgan take a different view of rewards. Dimon, after being obliged to rub along on $11.5m for 2012, has been judged to have suffered enough. He will be paid $20m for 2013. What about the bank's $23bn provision for legal settlements and fines, which have been arriving thick and fast and knocking holes in profits? It is all evidence, apparently, of how well Dimon has been managing the settlement process. Of course.
