    "webTitle": "Why Bill Grimsey's riding to the aid of British high streets", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's high streets may be struggling but veteran retailer Bill Grimsey rode into town this week with a plan to revive local shopping centres. The multi-millionaire sees himself as a gunslinger fighting on the side of independent retailers whom, he says, have been poorly served by the government, by industry bodies and by retail guru Mary Portas, who led a review into the plight of the high street nearly two years ago. Grimsey's own review, launched last week, has called for a revamp of the business rates system, a full-time high streets minister and professionally led town committees with a 20-year vision for their local area \u2013 partly funded by a levy on major national retailers. The report, put together by experts including Nick Hood of risk analyst Company Watch, Jackie Sadek of UK Regeneration and store data analyst Matthew Hopkinson of the Local Data Company, says more than 20,000 high-street businesses are currently at risk, with 47% of all UK retailers facing financial difficulties. Copies have been despatched to prime minister David Cameron, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband. Grimsey is also seeking a platform at all the party conferences. Portas has accused Grimsey of being too gloomy and failing to recognise the good work already happening in many town centres under the Portas Pilot schemes set up as a result of her report. Grimsey says: I'm not a gloom-monger, but if you'd been on the bridge of the Titanic and seen the iceberg you might have turned left. The facts are that there are a lot of small businesses out there poised to fail.\" Grimsey admits that many of the findings in his review are similar to Portas's own, but says he was angered by the way the Mary Queen of Shops TV programme tied into her review, which he says made light of the issue. This latest report, he says, is \"written by professionals for professionals\". Portas and Grimsey have since been trading insults. He says she is too nostalgic and cashed in on the series through her TV programme. She says it was him who cashed in, by writing a book (Sold Out) about the subject. He counters that the Portas review \"promised the Earth and delivered little\". She says he should stop playing politics. It is knockabout stuff, laughable if it weren't so important to so many high-street shops. But Grimsey is ploughing on: he has set out a timetable for trial town-centre commissions led by professional experts before the year's end. Grimsey, in his youth a long-haired fan of Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd, left school at 15 and soon afterwards joined the management training scheme at regional grocery chain Bishops. By his early twenties he was married with children. By the time he was 30 he was on the Bishops board. Jobs with Budgens and Tesco followed, then stints with Hong Kong grocer ParknShop, DIY chain Wickes and Big Food Group (BFG), previous owner of Iceland. After BFG, Grimsey invested in DIY group Focus with US private equity firm Cerberus Capital. But the chain struggled during the economic downturn and eventually went into administration. He admits that having worked for Tesco and Wickes he played his part in the downfall of the high street, but insists it was mainly a lifestyle choice by consumers: \"They were attracted by the convenience of out-of-town stores in the 1980s and 1990s.\" He became interested in the plight of the high street while at BFG, when his plan to turn Iceland into a convenience store chain was partly thwarted by Tesco's leap into that market with the acquisition of nearly 1,000 One Stop shops. He says the British Retail Consortium doesn't take action to help small shopkeepers for fear of upsetting the big retailers it also represents. \"Somebody has to stand up for small retailers,\" Grimsey says. He has appointed himself. He could have joined the government-backed high street forum, which has brought together retailers and other bodies to help local towns, but says rather cryptically: \"The forum asked me to join and I said, 'If you look up on the hill there's a campfire burning and that's us. When we come into town we want to come in with something and don't want to get bogged down in a gooey process.'\" He likes his cowboy analogy. He compares himself to Chico, the hot-headed Mexican from The Magnificent Seven who insists the other six join his campfire when they realise they need him. He is, he says, determined to keep up the pressure until someone listens.",

      "bodyText": "On the edge of deep green mountain forests in the centre of Germany \u2013 where east once met west \u2013 lies Germany's \"toy town\". As in every corner of Germany right now, smiling election candidates beam out from posters tied to lampposts in Sonneberg with snappy slogans promising \"safe jobs\" and to \"keep Germany strong\". There is little mention of looming problems that many experts predict will send Germany tumbling down the economic league tables over coming years. Instead, they are playing on the strengths of Sonneberg's mix of small and family-owned companies \u2013 the kind that dominate the buoyant German business landscape. Toy town is, for now, enjoying the latest of many resurgences through the centuries. \"Sonneberg and the area around it has one of the highest employment levels in Germany,\" says Christian Dressel, who runs the local job centre. \"Businesses have set up here \u2026 we have car industry companies, electronics firms making vacuum cleaners and TVs, toymakers and a training school for toymakers.\" In its heyday at the turn of the 20th century, Sonneberg was the world's leading toy producer. Mothers and fathers, son and daughters, crammed into home workshops and, with their neighbours, made up production lines that churned out every fifth toy in the world. One house would make dolls' wigs, the next along stuffed the bodies and another would craft their faces. When Sonneberg was swallowed up into the German Democratic Republic, the communist authorities merged its many toymakers into powerful co-operatives that made up 95% of the country's toy industry, exporting dolls, building blocks, trains and plastic trucks far and wide across the Soviet bloc and beyond. Little of that is left today. Rows of majestic villas and teddy-bear-shaped statues in the town square are testament to centuries of export might, but only a handful of toymakers remain. \"After the reunification those giant toymakers were no longer sustainable and collapsed very quickly,\" says Reinhild Schneider, director of the German Toy Museum in Sonneberg. \"If you look at the massive scale of production in the past and the renowned toymakers, what we see is a story of decline. You have to accept it. The world is changing.\" But in the place of Sonneberg's toymakers are industrial estates almost full to capacity with car parts manufacturers, mechanical engineering plants and plastics specialists. These are the sorts of small businesses that make up 99% of all German firms, and generate more than half the country's economic output. Sonneberg, and its transformation after the fall of the Berlin wall into a base for such Mittelstand (small and medium-sized) companies, encapsulates the wave of economic success that chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking to ride into the elections in two weeks' time. These companies, like many across Germany, have been enjoying growing exports as the eurozone finally emerges from recession. At 4.2%, Sonneberg's unemployment rate is among the lowest in the country and has halved in the past five years. Merkel's placards here promise more of the same for workers. But rivals to her centre-right Christian Democrats seize on growing disquiet in Germany about the value of all those jobs and what many see as rising inequality. Germany has one of the largest proportions of low earners in Europe \u2013 a quarter are on less than \u20ac9.54 (\u00a38.15) an hour \u2013 and for those at the bottom of the pay scale, wages have failed miserably to keep pace with inflation. Merkel's main challenger, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck of the Social Democrats, is promising top-ups for families on low incomes, while the leftwing Die Linke party is calling for a national minimum wage and a tax on millionaires under the slogan \"It's fun to share\". Sonneberg and its neighbouring towns also offer glimpses of a longer-term problem facing Germany. Europe's growth engine is grappling with the costs of one of the lowest birth rates in the world, and here at its heart the resulting skills shortage is already being felt. This is the biggest issue for more than 500 local Mittelstand bosses gathering for their Industrie- und Handelskammer (chamber of commerce and industry) gala, a short dash up the recently extended motorway in the town of Suhl. The chamber's latest survey showed a record number of businesses on good form, and there are high spirits at the annual knees-up, which features speeches, dance routines by a troupe draped in locally made LED lights, a prizegiving and a buffet of potato salad, schnitzels and sausages. But there are nods of recognition when the chamber president for South Thuringia, Dr Peter Traut, highlights a worsening labour crunch. \"When I started in this role 10 years ago there were 2,200 young people finishing their exams. Now there are 1,000 fewer. The maths is easy: it has virtually halved.\" The drive to attract young trainees is something Karl-Heinz Sladek has been working hard at. He is general manager of HPT Pharma Packaging, based in Sonneberg, and says the tables have been turned on German employers. While their counterparts in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece are inundated with applicants for every job, German bosses are left wondering where to find young people to meet the rising demand for their car parts, biotech innovations and other exports. \"It is no longer a case of young people applying to us; it's us applying for future trainees,\" he says. Companies are wooing school leavers with golden hellos, petrol vouchers, gym memberships and help with childcare. But the numbers are not in the employers' favour. The regional employment agency in Suhl has just reported a record August for trainee demand. There were 869 unfilled training slots but just 336 applicants still looking for a placement. At Sonneberg's job centre, Dressel has been trying to bring more workers into the area. He recently ferried a busload of potential Sonneberg settlers to a jobs fair from other, less buoyant parts of former East Germany. With his colleagues, he scouts around for companies elsewhere in Germany that are cutting staff or closing and then goes after the workers with brochures expounding the job opportunities and vaunting the quality of life in \"toy town\", with its vast forests, mountain-bike tracks and ski slopes. The shrinking pool of school leavers is a worrying trend for a country that has long prided itself on a tradition of apprenticeships and skilled work in a specific Beruf, or trade. That and a push towards innovation have kept Germany competitive in an increasingly global economy, according to Stefanie Spanagel, who runs an engine parts plant in Sonneberg for manufacturer Mann+Hummel. \"There is a pride in skilled crafts,\" she says. \"People don't just say I work at Mann+Hummel, they say I work as a tool maker at Mann+Hummel.\" Her plant \u2013 the biggest industrial employer in Sonneberg, with 500 staff \u2013 keeps 95% of the apprentices it takes on. Others battling in the increasingly cut-throat market for youngsters are not so lucky. Peter Stahlhut manages production at Glaswerk Ernstthal, on the edge of the town of Lauscha in the nearby Thuringia mountains. Workshops here have been crafting glass since the 16th century and claim to be the birthplace of the Christmas bauble. Lauscha is to Christmas decorations what Sonneberg is to toys. Stahlhut's factory now produces decorative glass bottles for the spirits industry, more than a third of them for export. The plant has 30 trainees among its 500 staff. But holding on to them is tough. \"In our industry you need experience to do the job well\u2026 that means years of learning and doing,\" says Stahlhut. \"But a glass works isn't the sexiest place to work. It's hot. It's noisy. You have to expect to lose 50% of the people you start training.\" Economists say the skills shortage will become more acute as the German population continues to fall. The official projections are for drastic ageing: in 2060, every third person will be 65 or older. Not only are people living longer, but when it comes to having children, Germans lag well behind most other OECD countries. There is anecdotal evidence among women that combining a job and a family is still frowned on. There is also research, including by the OECD, suggests that finding childcare remains a barrier to starting a family for some. This demographic time bomb has received too little attention in the election campaign, say many economists. \"They are not concentrating on structural reform, and that is what you need for women to have more kids,\" says Laurence Boone, chief European economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Analysts say that Germany also faces mounting pension and healthcare costs as the population ages and its advantageous economic position starts to crumble away. \"There are big implications for trend growth,\" says Boone. \"The more people who work, the more you grow. And if you have to choose between kids and working, you take women out of the workforce. You need children being born and women working. Not only is Germany's trend growth going to be lower than it was before the crisis five years ago, it's going to be closer to Italian trend growth and below Spanish, UK and French trend growth.\" Combining motherhood and work is an area where some western German states could learn a lesson from the former East Germany. Sonneberg's deputy mayor, Dr Heiko Voigt, recalls a time when things were different. \"In the old East Germany we had a very high female participation rate,\" he says. \"We had excellent childcare, and the birth rate was much higher.\" Sonneberg now offers care for every child that needs it. A full-time place with meals costs about \u00a3120 a month, with discounts for siblings. And toy town's family-friendliness is part of a wider push for business-friendliness in a place that initially suffered badly from the Wendeschock, when East and West Germany were reunited. \"After the wall came down, industry and business collapsed here,\" says Voigt. \"Firms with 3,000 workers went down to 300; some closed altogether. It was akin to what happened in British mining.\" Business groups and local authorities responded by renewing pre-second-world-war links with neighbouring towns in Bavaria. They also lobbied for new transport links and created industrial estates, including on the \"death strip\" where the border once stood. Voigt thinks the town's rebirth as one of the most economically active in Germany could be copied by struggling European neighbours. \"The toy industry is one of many legs that we stand on but not the most important one. You should always have several irons in the fire, be flexible, try unconventional ways of getting results.\" CASE STUDIES Krebs Glas Lauscha In the little German mountain town of Lauscha it is Christmas 365 days a year. Glassblowers have been crafting their wares here for 400 years. They began with simple round windowpanes and over the generations went on to supply bottles to pharmacists, festive baubles to department stores and glass eyes to doctors' clinics. Lauscha's steep high street is lined with a mix of Christmas shops, lampmakers and surgeries offering prosthetic eyes. But it is for its decorations the town is known in foreign markets. Krebs Glas Lauscha sends out 6m decorations from here every year and distributes tens of millions more. It sells to Selfridges and Harrods, and also distributes to France, Japan and north America. But as mass production has swept through the Christmas decorations market, the number of baubles handcrafted in Lauscha on the firm's order books has suffered. In 2011, Krebs Glas Lauscha closed its production plant here and now buys from workshops in the town for those customers who still want to spend big on Christmas. Rich Russians are buying the handmade and painted baubles, says manager Gerd Ross. \"In Russia, it's like it was in America in the 1960s,: you decorate a tree to show who you are.\" Demand is also rising in Latvia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. But Ross, whose father and grandfather made decorations in Lauscha, has seen drastic changes in most places. \"The market for quality products has become quite small \u2026 People now get Christmas decorations in DIY stores and general stores. It is a shame that things developed that way but we couldn't stop that,\" he says. \"People's habits have changed too. There was a saying in Lauscha: when things are not working out for people, Christmas tree decorations work. People always decorated their trees, whatever. Today at Christmas \u2026 people eat well, they travel, they go to places where snow is guaranteed or perhaps even sunshine, and so the demand for Christmas decorations falls.\" Piko Jens Beyer is under no illusions about the image of his industry. \"People don't out themselves as model railway enthusiasts,\" says the manager at Piko, one of Germany's biggest manufacturers of model trains. And yet, sales growth has been close to double digits in the last few years for Piko, one of the few toymakers left in Germany's one-time toy capital, Sonneberg. Exports are strong, customers are loyal and its plants in Sonneberg and south China are serving a growing share of the market, he says. Exports have always been important here. Set just over the Bavarian-Thuringian border in what was East Germany, Piko was made into a major toymaker under communism and became known to model buffs around the world as the go-to supplier for Soviet townscapes and trains. Today it still enjoys a strong following in the US, where it has a distribution centre, as well as rising demand in Russia. But model trains are a labour-intensive business and pressure on margins is high. Against a backdrop of stiff competition and stagnating disposable incomes for many of its customers, Piko opened its Chinese plant five years ago and the 300 workers there now easily outnumber the 170 assembling trains and running the machines in Sonneberg. The German toy town is still the workshop for 150 different PIKO products, which range from miniature cargo wagons to larger scale outdoor train sets. It is a market that thrives on new releases. \"We have to invest in new technology but especially in new products,\" says Beyer. PIKO pays \u20ac150,000 for a set of moulds for a single locomotive. Where possible it will use that mould for a number of variations by changing the plastic colour or logos to represent the variety of real-life rail operators. \"Rail privatisations have been good for us,\" says Beyer. Like most other manufacturers, Piko's bosses worry about skilled labour shortages and there is pressure too from rising energy costs \u2013 a constant point of tension between German business and the state since the government vowed to phase out nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a Carney-free fortnight in Asia Minor, I returned to Blighty to find even my dentist singing the praises of the new governor. Having temporarily abandoned his ambition to be prime minister of Canada or head of the IMF \u2013 at 48, he has time on his side \u2013 Carney has in effect accepted the role of frontman for George Osborne's election campaign. The governor enjoys the limelight, and turned down an invitation to share a stage with the chancellor and other dignitaries at the Institute of Directors' annual conference in favour of his recent solo media event in Nottingham, where he seems to have impressed television viewers such as my dentist with smart answers to questions about the prospect for exchange rates: some would go up; some would go down. A famous spin doctor who spoke to me on condition of anonymity suspects that Carney is riding for a fall. We shall see. He is certainly trying to be the George Clooney of central banking, and ought to have sufficient grasp of history to beware of fostering his own personality cult. The dangers of disregarding history are vividly explained in a new book When the Money Runs Out by Stephen D King, the group chief economist at HSBC. King castigates his fellow economists for choosing, in their obsession with \"precision-engineered mathematical models\", not to recognise \"the myriad economic failures that have occurred throughout the ages, believing that those past failures had no relevance to the modern world\". Yet here we are, having experienced the worst economic depression and slowest \"recovery\" of several lifetimes, and we have a government that talks about \"rebalancing\" the economy \u2013 towards more physical investment and a solid capacity for exports \u2013 but in fact is doing its best to stoke up an old-fashioned consumer and house price boom, of the sort that history tells us is almost bound to end in tears. Osborne's gamble, of course, is that the tears will not be shed until after an election victory. Meanwhile, he hopes to fool most of the people until that time with the illogical and wholly unjustified claim that the cynical policy of austerity has been worthwhile, because it has \"laid the foundations\" for recovery. In fact, Osborne's policy has been shaking the foundations rather than laying them. And to judge from Carney's public utterances and his written evidence to the House of Commons Treasury committee, he has made a serious study of recent British economic history and understands the trading problem, which was exacerbated by years of overvaluation of the pound, until the post-2007 devaluation. It is worth recalling the background to Carney's appointment. The chancellor sought him out, and pursued him like a love-struck bobbysoxer, because he knew that his own economic strategy had failed. \"Expansionary fiscal contraction\" proved to be the oxymoron it always seemed to be: while investment in infrastructure was cut, and the poor suffered disproportionately from the savage squeeze on social services and local authority expenditure, the private sector did not fill the gap. Osborne's belief was that a spontaneous revival of the private sector would fill that void, encouraged by loose monetary policy. But real incomes were reduced both by the ill-advised increase in VAT in 2010 and by the way that strong demand in China and other so-called \"emerging\" economies kept oil and other commodity prices high. Economic history teaches us that there comes a time when, even in the face of crass macroeconomic policies, economies will eventually hit bottom and begin to revive. That this is happening at last is obviously to be welcomed, although the emphasis the government is putting on boosting demand for existing houses, as opposed to the massive housebuilding programme advocated by Labour, is disturbing, and even caused the outgoing governor, Lord King \u2013 who had been all too supportive of the fiscal squeeze \u2013 to register his concern about what the government was up to. Carney seems too relaxed about the dangers of the house-price bubble, which is being encouraged by the government and his own promise of low interest rates for the indefinite future. That shrewd observer Trevor Greetham, of Fidelity Worldwide Investments, warns: \"The government has lost patience with talk of living within one's means. With the 2015 general election coming into view it has unleashed the beast, tempting consumers to leverage their balance sheets into a new housing bubble.\" Nevertheless, any signs of a more broad-based recovery are to be welcomed, as long as people are not fooled into thinking this is the result of misconceived and wasteful policies of austerity. It remains to be seen how widespread this incipient revival will prove, and how sustainable. It was that great Bank of England chief economist, Christopher Dow, who used to say, before the summer holidays, \"things will look very different in September\".

But Ashley will be hoping for a better reception when he meets shareholders of his Sports Direct empire at its annual meeting on Wednesday. He will have good news to tell them: trading is expected to have remained strong, with the company benefiting from an increasingly dominant position as competitors such as JJB have fallen by the wayside. The retailer is also likely to be confirmed as the latest member of the FTSE 100 index of Britain's top companies following a surge in the value of its shares. A far cry from its troubled stock market debut in 2007 and fractious relationship with the City. But it is not all sweetness and light. Some of the doubts over Ashley's stewardship of Newcastle United also afflict Sports Direct. Following its final results in July, the retailer was praised for paying bonuses of up to \u00a3100,000 to 2,000 staff. However the shine was soon taken off when it emerged that 20,000 part-time workers were on so-called zero-hours contracts. These mean staff do not know how many hours they will work from one week to the next, nor do they get sick pay or even holiday pay. A former employee has begun legal action against the company. Sports Direct is not keen to comment on the issue, but on Wednesday it may have no choice. Silvio raises eurozone fears Silvio Berlusconi has remained pretty central to Italian politics despite stepping down as prime minister in 2011 and facing various court cases. His centre-right coalition won 29% of the votes in elections earlier this year, and ended up supporting current prime minister Enrico Letta. But tomorrow a special senate committee will vote on whether to start proceedings to expel Berlusconi from parliament following his recent conviction for tax fraud. If that happens, it would raise the prospect of Berlusconi pulling out of the fragile coalition government, plunging Italy into yet another crisis and reminding everyone the eurozone is by no means out of the woods yet. Conflicting comments from various Berlusconi allies have not helped, ranging as they do from threatening to bring down Letta's government to maintaining support for the coalition. Analysts at Investec summed it up: \"While this [Monday's meeting] could see nervousness over a possible collapse of the Italian government rise further, a final decision would hinge on the senate later voting in a full sitting before Berlusconi's expulsion would be confirmed.\" TSB bounces back Banks will be in the spotlight again this week, not that they ever really left it. Barclays will press the button on its near-\u00a36bn cash call on Friday, which happens to be the 13th of the month. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the bank has already been hit by bad luck. Early visitors to its website seeking details about the fundraising found themselves directed instead to the website of a company that supplies cattle semen. Only shareholders on the register on Friday will be eligible to take part, with a prospectus due shortly after and shares due to begin trading on 3 October. Meanwhile, a 200-year-old brand returns to the high street on Monday when Lloyds spins off 632 of its branches under the TSB name. TSB emerged from the \"trustee savings bank\" movement. But in the mid-1990s, following its takeover by Lloyds, the name disappeared. Now, thanks to Europe demanding Lloyds sell branches in return for approving the government's investment in the bank, it's back. After a failed plan to sell the branches to Co-op Bank, they will now be floated, and this week's separation is the first step in that process. So thousands of Lloyds customers will find themselves in a new entity, although some seem to want to stay where they were, preferring to stay with Lloyds. Where's the trust?",

      "bodyText": "Confidential documents have revealed the formidable lobbying operation waged by a tobacco giant seeking to undermine efforts to make cigarettes less attractive to children and women, and force packs to carry larger health warnings. The documents obtained by the Observer show how Philip Morris International (PMI) employed 161 people to combat a proposed tobacco products directive (TPD), a major piece of European Union legislation that health campaigners say would save lives. Under proposals by the commission's ENVI public health committee, which had been due to be voted on this week in the European parliament, cigarette companies would be forced to include large pictorial health warnings on tobacco products covering 75% of the front and back of packs. There would also be a ban on all flavoured tobacco products \u2013 such as menthol, vanilla and strawberry \u2013 and on slim cigarettes and slim cigarette packs. These are seen as particularly attractive to younger smokers and to women, say health experts. The directive could also lead to e-cigarettes being regulated under pharmaceutical legislation and sold like medicines, something some new entrants in the market oppose. On Thursday it emerged that the crucial vote had been postponed by MEPs until 8 October, a significant victory for the tobacco lobby. As a result, time is running out to introduce the directive before January when the presidency passes from Lithuania, which is pro-regulation, to Greece, which is opposed to tobacco control. \"There is little time to get the directive passed before this parliament comes to an end and the whole process has to start again,\" said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash. \"That would be good news for the tobacco industry in its endless search to wring profits out of new addicts, but terrible news for children and young people across Europe.\" Delaying the directive has been a key goal of the tobacco lobby. Internal PMI EU public affairs briefings from 2011 and 2012 \u2013 marked \"private and confidential. For internal discussion and illustration purposes only\" \u2013 show that the tobacco giant, which now employs David Cameron's election strategist Lynton Crosby as a consultant, was intent on derailing the directive. In one slide dated 9 August 2012, PMI discusses whether its strategic objective is to \"push\" (ie remove elements of the directive) or to \"delay\" it. A company spreadsheet reveals that it used 161 employees and consultants in lobbying. It shows that in the year to June 2012, the lobbyists claimed almost \u00a31.25m in expenses for their meetings with MEPs. The spreadsheet shows that by 22 June last year, 233 MEPs \u2013 31% of the total \u2013 had been met by PMI at least once. In a separate spreadsheet, several MEPs are listed as having been met four or five times. Almost half of the European People's Party and European centre-right groups met with PMI's lobbyists, the documents show. The internal slides also show how PMI targeted farmers' organisations, retail bodies and trade and business associations to reach high-level decision makers in the European parliament and the European Commission. There is also evidence that the company commissioned academic and economic studies to promote its claims. One slide showed PMI's intention to generate avis n\u00e9gatifs (negative opinions) about proposals put forward by the EC's Sanco directorate \u2013 the body charged with ensuring health and consumer protection. Another slide explained that it was PMI's objective to ensure \"that menthol be excluded from characterising flavours ban in TPD\". PMI said it would not comment on the confidential documents leaked to the Observer. However, in a statement it said it believed the directive was flawed. \"It is up to the EU to set the timeline for considering this legislation, and it is our hope that these flaws will be addressed and that the EU implements a regulatory framework that is fair, science-based and makes sense in light of the EU's priorities, without imposing unnecessary burden on the economy,\" PMI said. Separately, emails released under the Freedom of Information Act by the Department of Health reveal that concerns about the directive were shared by other tobacco firms. Earlier this year the department feared that Imperial Tobacco had obtained protected information from the European Council working group, which was helping draw up the directive. The matter raised concerns in Whitehall that the tobacco lobby was in receipt of market sensitive information, raising questions about the relationship between Brussels and lobbyists. Imperial wrote to the department to say it was alarmed to learn that in April the government had spoken in favour of plain packaging for cigarettes during a European Council working group meeting and demanded confirmation from the department. When asked to reveal the source of its information, Imperial declined to tell the department. The department was forced to write to Imperial explaining that the council's reports \"are subject to principles of professional secrecy\".",

Almost half of the European People's Party and European centre-right groups met with PMI's lobbyists, the documents show.</p> <p>The internal slides also show how PMI targeted farmers' organisations, retail bodies and trade and business associations to reach high-level decision makers in the European parliament and the European Commission.</p> <p>There is also evidence that the company commissioned academic and economic studies to promote its claims.</p> <p>One slide showed PMI's intention to generate <em>avis n\u00e9gatifs</em> (negative opinions) about proposals put forward by the EC's Sanco directorate \u2013 the body charged with ensuring health and consumer protection.</p> <p>Another slide explained that it was PMI's objective to ensure \"that menthol be excluded from characterising flavours ban in TPD\". PMI said it would not comment on the confidential documents leaked to the <em>Observer</em>. However, in a statement it said it believed the directive was flawed. \"It is up to the EU to set the timeline for considering this legislation, and it is our hope that these flaws will be addressed and that the EU implements a regulatory framework that is fair, science-based and makes sense in light of the EU's priorities, without imposing unnecessary burden on the economy,\" PMI said.</p> <p>Separately, emails released under the Freedom of Information Act by the Department of Health reveal that concerns about the directive were shared by other tobacco firms.</p> <p>Earlier this year the department feared that Imperial Tobacco had obtained protected information from the European Council working group, which was helping draw up the directive.</p> <p>The matter raised concerns in Whitehall that the tobacco lobby was in receipt of market sensitive information, raising questions about the relationship between Brussels and lobbyists.</p> <p>Imperial wrote to the department to say it was alarmed to learn that in April the government had spoken in favour of plain packaging for cigarettes during a European Council working group meeting and demanded confirmation from the department.</p> <p>When asked to reveal the source of its information, Imperial declined to tell the department.</p> <p>The department was forced to write to Imperial explaining that the council's reports \"are subject to principles of professional secrecy\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Forget stocks and shares, the FT and the London Stock Exchange: the truly savvy investor is buying up classic cars, reading Octane Magazine and hanging out at Goodwood racetrack. And if you are up for a flutter \u2013 in investment terms \u2013 then go straight for those red cars made in Italy. Classic Ferrari values are accelerating faster than the heroic driver Fangio ever did. In the last 12 months alone the cost of top-end vintage Ferraris has risen by 55%, thrashing competition from Mercedes Benz (a mere 24% increase) and Porsche (13%), according to the Historic Automobile Group, which tracks and publishes prices. Dietrich Hatlapa, a former investment banker and founder of the Historic Automobile Group, said the soaring value of Ferraris and other classic names cannot easily be explained by any one factor. \"It's a cocktail of things: rarity, technical sophistication, racing pedigree and continuing competitive success. But what you can say is everyone who buys one of these cars is passionate about them.\" The supremacy of the Italian marque was underlined three weeks ago when a 1967 Ferrari 275 Spyder sold for $27.5m (\u00a317.5m) at an auction in California \u2013 the highest price ever recorded at a US public sale. That is climbing towards what is believed to be the highest sum paid for any car, the $35m paid last year for another Ferrari \u2013 the 1962 GTO 250 made originally for British racing legend Sir Stirling Moss. But it is not just the most rare and expensive Ferraris or Bugattis that are soaring in value, it is a whole range of cars all the way down to mass-produced volume sports cars of the past such as E Type Jags, the best of which can now fetch \u00a380,000 apiece. All the figures from the Historic Automobile Group are fed into an index and then compared with other investment \"asset classes\" and published as a Wealth Report by upmarket London estate agent Knight Frank. This shows that in the 12 months to the end of June the value of classic cars as a whole was up by 28%, which compared with a rise of 12% for the FTSE-100 index of leading shares and a 23% slump in the price of gold. Measured over 10 years the performance of automobiles is even more stunning, with their value up by 430% compared with 55% for the FTSE and 273% for gold \u2013 the latter always regarded as a safe haven in turbulent financial times. Hatlapa believes that classic cars can sooth the furrowed brow of an investor in bad times. \"When there is a financial crisis some worry that their stocks and shares may become worthless. It is reassuring to see that tangible [car] investment in the garage. It brings a smile to your face and if you choose you can go out and drive it. There is the fun factor.\" Although you are likely to see pictures in the media of very famous or very rich car enthusiasts \u2013 think Rod Stewart, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason or JCB magnate Sir Anthony Bamford \u2013 Hatlapa denies that classic-car buying is an elitist activity. \"It's very much a mass phenomenon with a huge rise in events. If you really want to get involved, as many do, you can pick up a vintage model, even a Hillman Imp or something, and do it up in your own garage. If you go to the Goodwood Revival race meeting next weekend you will find thousands of ordinary people have brought their own [vintage] cars.\" The Goodwood Revival, described by organiser Lord March as the Glastonbury of the motor-racing world, is already sold out and follows on from the Goodwood Festival of Speed earlier this year, when nearly 200,000 people turned up. But it is the modern Formula One race tracks elsewhere that also help build values for historic cars. The continuing success of Ferrari at the top level of motor sport is considered to help keep prices up. Rarity helps too \u2013 fewer than 50 vehicles were made of some versions of the Spyder. The figures on car values speak for themselves, although there have been some reports that volumes being sold at auction have been in decline. But cars are not the only alternative investment going up in price. The Knight Frank Wealth Report also shows antique stamps rose 7% for the 12 months to the end of June and have risen by 60% over the last five years and 255% over the last decade. Coins were up by 9% over the last year and have shot up by 225% over the last 10 years. Antique furniture is down in value 3% over the year and nearly 20% on 10 years ago, while fine art is down 6% on the year but up 183% over the decade. Why these changes? Andrew Shirley, editor of the Wealth Report, notes that both wine (up 3% on the year) and art are historically more volatile even than stocks and shares. \"This is not only due to economic conditions, but also to changing trends and fashions within the luxury collectibles market that can quickly create and deflate bubbles. This means index results for an asset class may not necessarily reflect the performance of individual pieces or works of art,\" he explains. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2013 to correct the name of the Historic Automobile Group from Historic Motor Group as the original said.",
