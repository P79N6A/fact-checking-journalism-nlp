    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "As Ireland grapples with the debt of its fallen tycoons, two of them \u2013 high-living Derek Quinlan and angry Paddy McKillen \u2013 are still at war in the high court", 
      "body": "<p>At the height of his powers, Irish property tycoon Derek Quinlan was jetting around Europe buying hotels as if skipping across a Monopoly board. His Mayfair-based firm, Quinlan Private, a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.7bn) real estate empire, was vying with Arab sheikhs and US private equity houses to snap up some of the continent's most prized trophy buildings.</p> <p>Back home in Ireland he was dubbed \"King Midas\"; politicians, lawyers and celebrities ranging from former chat show host Gay Byrne to U2 band members Bono and The Edge queued up to invest in his deals. In America, the press called him the \"European realty tsar\".</p> <p>Renowned for his appreciation of fine wines, Quinlan, the son of an army officer, kept an expansive cellar of vintages at Claridge's \u2013 one of three prime Mayfair hotels he co-owned with fellow Irishman and property developer Paddy McKillen and the wealthy Green family from Manchester.</p> <p>But the halcyon days ended abruptly, or so it seemed, in the wake of the Irish banking crash of 2008. Having built his empire on aggressive borrowing, Quinlan went from poster boy of the Celtic tiger economy to a symbol of Ireland's folly. Many who had placed their savings with him saw their investments wiped out. His venture with McKillen went very sour, leading to a prolonged and bitter court battle that is still not over; hostilities are to be renewed this week.</p> <p>As the dust settled on Quinlan's collapsing empire after the crash, it became increasingly apparent that, far from being destitute, he was still able to live high on the hog. Even as his investments were crumbling in 2009, he racked up hotel bills of \u00a3285,000 at Claridge's and its sister hotels in Mayfair. In May 2009, on the advice of KPMG, he relocated to Switzerland for a period, resigning from Quinlan Private. Some time later he returned to the UK, taking a large villa in Putney, west London.</p> <p>His children were able to remain at boarding schools despite their father's financial embarrassment. And his wife even bought a new Range Rover, estimated to be worth more than \u00a370,000. Quinlan himself, meanwhile, could be spotted in his favourite Mayfair members' clubs \u2013 Annabel's, The George, Harry's Bar and the Dunhill.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprisingly, two months ago, Quinlan was able to find \u00a350m to participate in a cash call on investors at Coroin, the company behind Claridge's, the Connaught and the Berkeley hotels. Shareholders had been required to inject more capital in order to pay down unsustainable debts of \u00a3660m.</p> <p>Much of Quinlan's opulent lifestyle, it emerged in a court battle last year, had been bankrolled by Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, owners of the Ritz hotel and <em>Telegraph</em> newspaper titles. Two advances totalling more than \u00a31m each were made between late 2010 and early 2012. The brothers have since helped fund his take-up of rights at Coroin.</p> <p>The Barclays, who declined to appear in court, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/26/barclay-brothers-property-baron-loan-bid-hotels\" title=\"\">insisted their financial support for the Quinlan family had been provided out of friendship</a>, and was nothing to do with deals struck at around the same time that effectively gave the brothers control of Quinlan's stake in Coroin.</p> <p>Also at that time, the Barclays bought out the Green family's stake in the hotel group. Together, these moves left McKillen an isolated minority investor. He was said to be fizzing with rage when, in January 2011, he received a text from Quinlan's right-hand man, Gerry Murphy, saying: \"Greens are talking to Barclay Twins who have contacted Derek \u2026 Seems incredible.

      "bodyText": "At the height of his powers, Irish property tycoon Derek Quinlan was jetting around Europe buying hotels as if skipping across a Monopoly board. His Mayfair-based firm, Quinlan Private, a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.7bn) real estate empire, was vying with Arab sheikhs and US private equity houses to snap up some of the continent's most prized trophy buildings. Back home in Ireland he was dubbed \"King Midas\"; politicians, lawyers and celebrities ranging from former chat show host Gay Byrne to U2 band members Bono and The Edge queued up to invest in his deals. In America, the press called him the \"European realty tsar\". Renowned for his appreciation of fine wines, Quinlan, the son of an army officer, kept an expansive cellar of vintages at Claridge's \u2013 one of three prime Mayfair hotels he co-owned with fellow Irishman and property developer Paddy McKillen and the wealthy Green family from Manchester. But the halcyon days ended abruptly, or so it seemed, in the wake of the Irish banking crash of 2008. Having built his empire on aggressive borrowing, Quinlan went from poster boy of the Celtic tiger economy to a symbol of Ireland's folly. Many who had placed their savings with him saw their investments wiped out. His venture with McKillen went very sour, leading to a prolonged and bitter court battle that is still not over; hostilities are to be renewed this week. As the dust settled on Quinlan's collapsing empire after the crash, it became increasingly apparent that, far from being destitute, he was still able to live high on the hog. Even as his investments were crumbling in 2009, he racked up hotel bills of \u00a3285,000 at Claridge's and its sister hotels in Mayfair. In May 2009, on the advice of KPMG, he relocated to Switzerland for a period, resigning from Quinlan Private. Some time later he returned to the UK, taking a large villa in Putney, west London. His children were able to remain at boarding schools despite their father's financial embarrassment. And his wife even bought a new Range Rover, estimated to be worth more than \u00a370,000. Quinlan himself, meanwhile, could be spotted in his favourite Mayfair members' clubs \u2013 Annabel's, The George, Harry's Bar and the Dunhill. Perhaps most surprisingly, two months ago, Quinlan was able to find \u00a350m to participate in a cash call on investors at Coroin, the company behind Claridge's, the Connaught and the Berkeley hotels. Shareholders had been required to inject more capital in order to pay down unsustainable debts of \u00a3660m. Much of Quinlan's opulent lifestyle, it emerged in a court battle last year, had been bankrolled by Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, owners of the Ritz hotel and Telegraph newspaper titles. Two advances totalling more than \u00a31m each were made between late 2010 and early 2012. The brothers have since helped fund his take-up of rights at Coroin. The Barclays, who declined to appear in court, insisted their financial support for the Quinlan family had been provided out of friendship, and was nothing to do with deals struck at around the same time that effectively gave the brothers control of Quinlan's stake in Coroin. Also at that time, the Barclays bought out the Green family's stake in the hotel group. Together, these moves left McKillen an isolated minority investor. He was said to be fizzing with rage when, in January 2011, he received a text from Quinlan's right-hand man, Gerry Murphy, saying: \"Greens are talking to Barclay Twins who have contacted Derek \u2026 Seems incredible. Don't blow a gasket on this news.\" In the welter of acrimony that ensued, Quinlan took care to remove his beloved wine collection from the cellars at Claridge's, underlining his effective detachment from the business. McKillen claims the Barclay brothers illegally circumvented an agreement between Coroin shareholders in a plot to seize control of the hotels involving side payments to Quinlan. It is a belief that has already cost him more than \u00a325m in legal bills, and Mr Justice David Richards last August handed down a 158-page high court judgment finding that the dealings between the Barclays and Quinlan were \u2013 as they had claimed in court \u2013 entirely lawful. All seemed lost for McKillen, as the Observer reported in October. He said he feared, if victorious, that the Barclays would surely attempt to force him out of Coroin by insisting on a costly rights issue that would dilute his interest. Sure enough the rights issue did come in December last year, but \u2013 to the surprise of many \u2013 this did not spell the end of the battle for Claridge's. Despite his considerable debts, McKillen too was able to find the necessary \u00a350m to ensure his holding in Coroin shares was not diminished. The Observer understands that the Al Thani ruling family of Qatar, with whom McKillen hopes to eventually co-own the hotels, helped finance his take-up of rights. And with the Qataris in his corner, McKillen is returning to the courts on Tuesday to appeal against Richards's ruling. As a marker of his determination, he has added the former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, to his legal team. So sensitive and unusual is the pact between the Irishman and the emirate over the Mayfair hotels \u2013 favoured destinations for many wealthy Middle Eastern visitors \u2013 that it required the help of former prime minister Tony Blair to broker it last year. Nevertheless, lawyers for the Barclays have ridiculed McKillen's insistence that he remains a man of independent wealth, suggesting it is a case of \"the emperor's new clothes\". Moreover, they claimed in court, the Irishman had himself been seeking side deals for personal gain from his Qatari backers should he deliver them a big stake in Coroin. McKillen explained to Richards that these proposed side deals had been for genuine work managing the hotels. But lawyers for the Barclays said the multimillion-pound terms that had been discussed with the Qataris would \"make avarice itself blush\". As Britain's most expensive barristers gear up for an another fee-earning bonanza this week, and Quinlan and McKillen continue to enjoy the support of their respective backers, the picture remains grim back in Dublin. Some years ago Quinlan told Nama, Ireland's state-owned toxic loan management operation, that he would never be able to repay the millions he owes. One top Nama official told the high court in London last year he was sceptical about assertions that advances from the Barclays to the Quinlans were made because the brothers saw a friend in need. Several of Quinlan's investments have been seized by creditors, leading to a string of fire sales \u2013 among them a yacht, a villa on the Riviera at Cap Ferrat and one of Andy Warhol's dollar sign paintings. Yet these have registered little impact \u2013 visible to the outsider, at least \u2013 on the lifestyle of the Quinlans. Meanwhile, with Irish banks being nationalised, Nama has taken over the worst of their bad loans to Quinlan and others. Facing state bankruptcy in 2010, Ireland itself sought loans from Europe and the International Monetary Fund. In the witness box, Quinlan was confronted over the appropriateness of his lavish lifestyle. \"Extravagant is a relative term,\" he said. \"What may be extravagant to somebody is not extravagant to somebody else.\" Richard Boyd Barrett, a leftwing member of the D\u00e1il, said: \"[It is] utterly unacceptable that somebody who has helped bankrupt this country and who owes us hundreds of millions should be living the high life in London.\" A spokesman for Quinlan said: \"[He] continues to work on paying down his Nama debts.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "She is probably one of the most influential women in fashion retailing that you have never heard of. And unlike some industry types, wrapped up in the crazy world of champagne-swilling, shoulder-rubbing and back-slapping, Kim Winser seems to prefer it that way. The 53-year-old former commercial director of Marks &amp; Spencer, boss of Aquascutum and chairman of Agent Provocateur, is almost nervous about putting her name to her new clothing business, despite her deep conviction that Winser London will be a worldwide brand in just a few years. \"To use my name is such a big decision, but it's such a good name, or so people tell me,\" Winser laughs. \"It has a nice twist in that it doesn't have the same spelling as our lovely royal family.\" That would be the royal family that presented her with an OBE in 2006 for services to the fashion industry, where she has worked since 1977, after joining Marks &amp; Spencer's management trainee scheme. She raced up the corporate ladder to become Marks's first female \u2013 and youngest ever \u2013 commercial director, moving on to become menswear executive and then attaining the holy grail of retail \u2013 director of womenswear. However smooth it looked, she says, it certainly wasn't straightforward to get into what had been a male-dominated part of the fashion industry \u2013 the commercial, or merchandising side. \"I was rejected two or three times because they said, 'But you're not male.' I said, 'I had noticed, but I want to be in the commercial side of the business', only to be told 'no female goes into that'. \"I wanted it because I thought I'd be good at it, rather than because I would be the first woman to do it. So, it was never about breaking rules or getting badges, it was because I knew that that would be where I would flourish.\" The straight-talking and sometimes self-deprecating businesswoman is keen to point out that she doesn't know it all. Her secret to success, she says, is surrounding herself with people who are the very best in their area of expertise. \"I think the best thing is to recruit people who are better than you, then you've got experts in every field in your team. \"Unfortunately, I see sometimes that CEOs and chairmen whom I don't admire want to recruit people who are weaker than them because they are a bit frightened about people being too good, and are unable to admit they might have some weaknesses \u2013 which is bizarre because we can't all be perfect at everything.\" She adds: \"There are still a lot of companies that are stuck in a period where everything is very bureaucratic, which is a great shame because the young talent kicking around in the business don't get their say.\" And this philosophy is at the heart of her latest business, an online-only venture selling high-quality women's clothing at affordable prices, where she is employing 25 people ranging from senior and experienced retailers to rookie fashion graduates. She believes now is the perfect time to launch an internet business focusing on quality, because the price competition elsewhere in the industry has become so intense that shoppers are no longer surprised if their cherished garments start to fall apart not long after arriving in their wardrobes. \"We're in the Primark generation, where people want three items for the price of one. It's shocking how much the quality of clothing has deteriorated since I was at Marks and Spencer. \"But I think we're coming full circle, to a point where women want to buy one really nice piece instead of three. I think there's something really distasteful about buying clothes you know you're going to throw away within a year.\" Winser hopes to use her vast contacts book to connect directly with manufacturers around the world. \"Look at this,\" she says, pointing to the knitted sweater she's wearing in her hotel suite in the heart of Mayfair. \"If you find something similar around here for under \u00a3500 you'll be doing well. On my website, it's just \u00a3200.\" So certain is she about the website's success that discussions about worldwide expansion in around three years' time are already under way with her Middle Eastern backers \u2013 whose identity she declines to reveal. And Winser has good reason to feel confident: after all, she managed to turn Pringle of Scotland from what she calls, \"a discounted men's golf clothes business\", into a successful fashion house attracting customers including David Beckham, Robbie Williams, Guy Richie and Madonna. Then, in 2006, she became boss of Aquascutum, again turning the business around and attempting a management buyout, before quitting when it became apparent the Japanese owners intended to split up the company and sell it. It sounds as though that experience still rankles. \"I didn't have a back-up plan at that point because I was totally and utterly dedicated to Aquascutum.\" However, within days of her departure being announced, online retailer Net-a-Porter signed her as an adviser, and private equity firm 3i requested her services. While working advising family investment funds stretching from Brazil to the Middle East, she set about searching for a retail brand to snap up and call her own. But it soon became apparent that businesses were either overburdened with debt, stuck with landlords unwilling to lower their rent, or treating their online business like an unwanted appendage. \"I then decided to approach my investors with the idea for winserlondon.com, which they agreed to fund.\" Insisting that this is a long-term project, she says: \"I would have gone with private equity if I wanted to build and sell something within three years, not caring if it went under; I want to build something that lasts.\" But while she hopes her own brand will last for generations, she fears for the future of other fashion retailers operating in today's tough environment. The downturn has already swallowed up the likes of Peacocks, La Senza and her former company, Aquascutum, in the past 12 months. All have fallen into administration, although the latter was later saved. She says: \"I think business was easier up until the past five years. You could have really good people and you could have average people, but because there was so much money out there, lots of companies that should have been in more difficulty weren't. \"I think what's happening now is you have to be better than average, and those who aren't are struggling and falling into administration. You can't be just average any more. That, in a way, is quite exciting because it's making people work harder, and I think there are going to be some brands that develop well.\" So if everything is harder, why try launching a company now? \"I remember Warren Buffett said, 'I quite often do what people don't expect me to do, so I buy when everybody else is selling and sell when everyone else is buying'.\" As soon as Winser starts quoting the legendary US investor she stops herself. \"Don't put me down as quoting Warren Buffett. I don't want to be seen as comparing myself to him, because I'm not, but I do share his sentiment.\" With the same self-deprecating charm, she asks as she finishes posing for the Observer's photographer: \"Would you rather not use pictures of Yasmin Le Bon instead of me?\" But if, as she hopes, Winser London becomes a major worldwide fashion brand, she may have to get used to all this extra attention.",

Her secret to success, she says, is surrounding herself with people who are the very best in their area of expertise.</p> <p>\"I think the best thing is to recruit people who are better than you, then you've got experts in every field in your team.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately, I see sometimes that CEOs and chairmen whom I don't admire want to recruit people who are weaker than them because they are a bit frightened about people being too good, and are unable to admit they might have some weaknesses \u2013 which is bizarre because we can't all be perfect at everything.\"</p> <p>She adds: \"There are still a lot of companies that are stuck in a period where everything is very bureaucratic, which is a great shame because the young talent kicking around in the business don't get their say.\"</p> <p>And this philosophy is at the heart of her latest business, an online-only venture selling high-quality women's clothing at affordable prices, where she is employing 25 people ranging from senior and experienced retailers to rookie fashion graduates.</p> <p>She believes now is the perfect time to launch an internet business focusing on quality, because the price competition elsewhere in the industry has become so intense that shoppers are no longer surprised if their cherished garments start to fall apart not long after arriving in their wardrobes.</p> <p>\"We're in the Primark generation, where people want three items for the price of one. It's shocking how much the quality of clothing has deteriorated since I was at Marks and Spencer.</p> <p>\"But I think we're coming full circle, to a point where women want to buy one really nice piece instead of three. I think there's something really distasteful about buying clothes you know you're going to throw away within a year.\"</p> <p>Winser hopes to use her vast contacts book to connect directly with manufacturers around the world.</p> <p>\"Look at this,\" she says, pointing to the knitted sweater she's wearing in her hotel suite in the heart of Mayfair. \"If you find something similar around here for under \u00a3500 you'll be doing well. On my website, it's just \u00a3200.\"</p> <p>So certain is she about the website's success that discussions about worldwide expansion in around three years' time are already under way with her Middle Eastern backers \u2013 whose identity she declines to reveal.</p> <p>And Winser has good reason to feel confident: after all, she managed to turn <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2000/feb/15/6?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Pringle of Scotland</a> from what she calls, \"a discounted men's golf clothes business\", into a successful fashion house attracting customers including David Beckham, Robbie Williams, Guy Richie and Madonna.</p> <p>Then, in 2006, she became boss of Aquascutum, again turning the business around and attempting a management buyout, before quitting when it became apparent the Japanese owners intended to split up the company and sell it.</p> <p>It sounds as though that experience still rankles. \"I didn't have a back-up plan at that point because I was totally and utterly dedicated to Aquascutum.\"</p> <p>However, within days of her departure being announced, online retailer Net-a-Porter signed her as an adviser, and private equity firm 3i requested her services.</p> <p>While working advising family investment funds stretching from Brazil to the Middle East, she set about searching for a retail brand to snap up and call her own. But it soon became apparent that businesses were either overburdened with debt, stuck with landlords unwilling to lower their rent, or treating their online business like an unwanted appendage. \"I then decided to approach my investors with the idea for winserlondon.com, which they agreed to fund.\"</p> <p>Insisting that this is a long-term project, she says: \"I would have gone with private equity if I wanted to build and sell something within three years, not caring if it went under; I want to build something that lasts.\"</p> <p>But while she hopes her own brand will last for generations, she fears for the future of other fashion retailers operating in today's tough environment.</p> <p>The downturn has already swallowed up the likes of Peacocks, La Senza and her former company, Aquascutum, in the past 12 months. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/01/uk-retail-collapses-timeline\" title=\"\">All have fallen into administration</a>, although <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/01/uk-retail-collapses-timeline\" title=\"\">the latter was later saved.</a></p> <p>She says: \"I think business was easier up until the past five years. You could have really good people and you could have average people, but because there was so much money out there, lots of companies that should have been in more difficulty weren't.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403421042\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/About/General/2013/2/2/1359796566457/Yasmin-Le-Bon-models-clot-010.jpg\" alt=\"Yasmin Le Bon models clothes for Winser London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yasmin Le Bon models for Winser London's forthcoming launch collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"I think what's happening now is you have to be better than average, and those who aren't are struggling and falling into administration. You can't be just average any more. That, in a way, is quite exciting because it's making people work harder, and I think there are going to be some brands that develop well.\"</p> <p>So if everything is harder, why try launching a company now? \"I remember Warren Buffett said, 'I quite often do what people don't expect me to do, so I buy when everybody else is selling and sell when everyone else is buying'.\"</p> <p>As soon as Winser starts quoting the legendary US investor she stops herself. \"Don't put me down as quoting Warren Buffett. I don't want to be seen as comparing myself to him, because I'm not, but I do share his sentiment.\"</p> <p>With the same self-deprecating charm, she asks as she finishes posing for the <em>Observer's </em>photographer: \"Would you rather not use pictures of Yasmin Le&#xa0;Bon instead of me?\"</p> <p>But if, as she hopes, Winser London becomes a major worldwide fashion brand, she may have to get used to all this extra attention.</p>",

Less well known, though, is a small office used by 10&#xa0;employees of SABMiller, the London-listed drinks giant behind beer brands such as Grolsch and Peroni. And this discreet group must be among the company's most productive staff.</p> <p>The only time these workers see a bottle of Grolsch is probably when they go to one of those nearby bars, but even so the subsidiary they work for, SABMiller International BV, made a post-tax profit of $78m in 2011 on revenues of $104m. If these figures \u2013 from accounts filed in the Netherlands \u2013 make you think the company appears to be benefiting from a low tax rate (it booked $5m in taxes in 2011), you are not alone.

SABMiller has been accused of using the structure to avoid tax not only in Europe but also, campaign group ActionAid argues, in Africa. The company denies these accusations, stating that it does not engage in aggressive tax avoidance and insisting that African brands are still owned by its businesses on that continent. Even so, campaigners and Cameron are by no means the only people paying closer attention to Dutch structures \u2013 common in the consumer goods industry.</p> <p>In the US, President Barack Obama presented a series of proposals in 2009 to curb offshore tax benefits. While he did not name the Netherlands in his speech, the fact sheet distributed with it said nearly a third of foreign profits reported by such corporations in 2003 came from three countries: Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands.</p> <p>The topic has now moved up the agenda. Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/31/ernst-young-tax-avoidance-schemes?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the UK's public accounts committee grilled tax experts</a> from the top four accounting firms, while in December the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/tax_fraud_evasion/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">European commission declared war on tax avoidance and evasion</a>, which it said costs the EU \u20ac1 trillion a year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Dutch parliament has just begun debating the fairness of its tax system, with a noticeable consensus, including members of the governing coalition, arguing that the rules may have to change.</p> <p>Because of the range of tax treaties the Netherlands has signed with other jurisdictions (see below), it has long been a favoured location for multinationals looking to shift profits around the world. There are rules designed to stop companies setting up in the country for tax purposes, but many suspect they are abused.</p> <p>Francis Weyzig, chairman of Tax Justice Network Europe, says many of the firms benefiting from generous Dutch tax treatment are \"mailbox companies\", with little more than an address. \"In certain cases,\" he says, \"Dutch law requires that at least 50% of the company directors are based here and the companies have board meetings here. But you can get around that \u2026 so the real directors don't have to fly to the Netherlands to have meetings.\"</p> <p>Weyzig has also been studying the accounts of SABMiller International BV (which has five directors), where documents say the firm \"has reached agreement with the fiscal authority whereby it will be allowed a flexible write-off of these intellectual property (IP) rights, amounting to 90% of the total amount of incoming royalties, until the IP is fully written off for tax purposes\". Weyzig argues: \"It seems the agreement allows SABMiller International BV to earn about $144m tax-free.\"</p> <p>The company says that there is no bespoke agreement and Weyzig has misinterpreted the figures. It also insists that SABMiller International BV gives the parent company zero tax benefit. That line puzzles tax campaigners, which is perhaps why debating Dutch tax structures is suddenly in vogue. And not just in bars around the Cool.</p>",

While he did not name the Netherlands in his speech, the fact sheet distributed with it said nearly a third of foreign profits reported by such corporations in 2003 came from three countries: Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands. The topic has now moved up the agenda. Last week, the UK's public accounts committee grilled tax experts from the top four accounting firms, while in December the European commission declared war on tax avoidance and evasion, which it said costs the EU \u20ac1 trillion a year. Meanwhile, the Dutch parliament has just begun debating the fairness of its tax system, with a noticeable consensus, including members of the governing coalition, arguing that the rules may have to change. Because of the range of tax treaties the Netherlands has signed with other jurisdictions (see below), it has long been a favoured location for multinationals looking to shift profits around the world. There are rules designed to stop companies setting up in the country for tax purposes, but many suspect they are abused. Francis Weyzig, chairman of Tax Justice Network Europe, says many of the firms benefiting from generous Dutch tax treatment are \"mailbox companies\", with little more than an address. \"In certain cases,\" he says, \"Dutch law requires that at least 50% of the company directors are based here and the companies have board meetings here. But you can get around that \u2026 so the real directors don't have to fly to the Netherlands to have meetings.\" Weyzig has also been studying the accounts of SABMiller International BV (which has five directors), where documents say the firm \"has reached agreement with the fiscal authority whereby it will be allowed a flexible write-off of these intellectual property (IP) rights, amounting to 90% of the total amount of incoming royalties, until the IP is fully written off for tax purposes\". Weyzig argues: \"It seems the agreement allows SABMiller International BV to earn about $144m tax-free.\" The company says that there is no bespoke agreement and Weyzig has misinterpreted the figures. It also insists that SABMiller International BV gives the parent company zero tax benefit. That line puzzles tax campaigners, which is perhaps why debating Dutch tax structures is suddenly in vogue. And not just in bars around the Cool.",

      "bodyText": "Liz Truss, the Tory childcare minister, was responding to a widely shared gripe among parents of young children last week when she set out the government's aspiration for what she called \"more great childcare\". But her plan for achieving this \u2013 cut red tape; sit back; wait for the market to provide \u2013 is a classic example of laissez-faire, supply-side economics at its most dangerous. Mums who want to work find it a battle to find affordable care for their little ones, and the task is hardest for those on low salaries, for whom the cost is likely to swallow up a large proportion of their take-home pay. Giving a helping hand to stay on in the workplace is a neat way of reaching out to disgruntled female voters, who, research shows, have been hit disproportionately hard by coalition cuts. It's also sound dinner-party politics: get any group of north London mums together, and the cost of childcare is up there among the hot topics with which soft play centre serves the best coffee. No doubt the same is true for Truss's chums in her Norfolk constituency. But the coalition's solution is to loosen the regulations that limit the number of children each childminder or nursery nurse can look after, provided they meet new, higher standards for qualifications. It all sounds great: free up the providers of care to take on a few more kids, and the market will sort out the rest. And in principle, there's nothing wrong with supply-side reforms of this kind: the inspection regime for childminders and nurseries is complex and onerous \u2013 why not just leave them to get on with their jobs? But there are three problems with Truss's approach. The first is that there's no necessary link between nurseries and childminders being allowed to take on more children and lower prices. Many private operators have long complained that the subsidy they receive for offering care to three-year-olds barely covers their costs. They may simply absorb the money from taking on more kids into their profit margins, rather than passing them on to cash-strapped mums and dads. Second, even if parents' bills do fall as a result of the changes, that will leave very little leeway for the boost to carers' incomes the government claims it would like to see. Many childminders and nursery workers are extremely poorly paid for a job that couldn't be much more important or more challenging, and they're operating in a market where unemployment is high and jobs hard to find. Truss would like to see a professionalisation of early-years care, with staff rebranded as \"early-years teachers\". But it's difficult to imagine nursery staff having enough clout with employers to push up wages, even if they do have a couple of GCSEs to hand. The Department for Education's own figures, published alongside last week's proposals, showed the average childminder in England earning just \u00a311,400 a year, compared with \u00a314,600 in Germany and \u00a321,500 in Denmark. If we expect self-employed childminders to pass on at least some of the benefits of taking on an extra toddler through lower prices, the flipside for them is onerous new responsibilities and a dramatic increase in productivity, for a fraction more pay. Truss hopes setting up new \"childminder agencies\" will help them to share some of the costs of finding clients, liaising with Ofsted, and so on, but the hardest part of a childminder's job is, er, minding children, and no agency's going to share that. The third reason to worry about this new, more lax regime is maintaining quality of care. Although it will mean some economies of scale for nurseries \u2013 they've only got to buy, kit out and heat one set of premises \u2013 childcare is not a production line, where turning out more can be done more cheaply. While better educated staff may be very welcome when it comes to playing imaginative games with children, or introducing them to the alphabet, there's no substitute for pairs of hands to do up little buttons, push buggies and give out cuddles. Managing six toddlers is more than a challenge \u2013 it's a nigh-on physical impossibility, as my colleague Polly Toynbee pointed out last week. Of course, parents will be able to \"choose\" whether to use a provider with a lower carer-to-child ratio, but if these become the norm, only affluent parents will be able to buy closer attention for their little darlings. Lower-paid families will be stuck with the new normal of sparser provision. Truss was one of the five members of the Tory Free Enterprise Group who wrote Britannia Unchained, a slim-but-powerful distillation of the idea that if only Britain's entrepreneurs could be set free from the dead hand of the state \u2013 and its lazy workers rouse themselves from their sofas \u2013 a new era of glorious economic expansion could be unleashed. But the assumption that snipping a bit of red tape and tweaking a few financial incentives is the answer to every problem is part of a retro creed that should have been comprehensively crushed by the crisis. Vince Cable, fortunately, managed to put a stop to most of the craziest recommendations of the Beecroft review, the thrust of which was that making it even easier to sack people in Britain's already super-flexible labour market would create new jobs. But Truss's proposals show a faith in market mechanisms to deliver, simultaneously, better-paid workers and better care, which experience in a host of areas suggests will be sadly disappointed. Recent research from the IPPR suggests that directly funding childcare would be cleaner, simpler, and deliver returns to the taxpayer and the wider economy. Some things are too important to be left to the market: perhaps this is a case where we need a good dose of the, ahem, nanny state.",
