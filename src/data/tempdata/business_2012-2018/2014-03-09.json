      "bodyText": "In the end, it took just over 10 months for Felix Baumgartner's skydiving record from 24 miles to be broken. With considerably less publicity, a small cuddly toy named Babbage fell from a height slightly above the Austrian's achievement after ascending to the stratosphere in a hydrogen-filled balloon. The elaborate skydive to a field in Berkshire was accomplished using credit card-sized Raspberry Pi computers which released the toy from the balloon when it reached 31 metres above Baumgartner's record and filmed the descent. It is just one of a multitude of unique projects the bare-boned machine has been used for. Launched in February 2012, more than 2.5m of the computers \u2013 which cost about \u00a330 \u2013 have now been sold around the world, a prodigious landmark considering the group of scientists behind it thought they might sell 1,000 at most. \"If you told me I was going to sell 10,000 I would have called bullshit on that,\" said Eben Upton, co-founder of the Raspberry Pi and the public face of the mini-computer. The idea came in 2006 after Upton and some colleagues in the computer laboratory in Cambridge University shared concerns over their Friday beers at the decline in the number and skills of students applying for computer science classes. Now 35, Upton's digital education began with a BBC Micro home computer, learning programming languages via books and being encouraged by enthusiastic teachers. He then went on to study physics at Cambridge after a year at IBM in a pre-university programme, where he became adept at experimenting with and reprogramming computers. When he became director of studies in computer science in Cambridge in 2004, Upton found A-level graduates no longer had his hobbyist experience when coming to university. PCs and games consoles had replaced the easily programmable machines of his youth, while schoolchildren were being taught to use word processors and spreadsheets instead of the code that created them. Coupled with this was a drop in applicants from the end of the dotcom boom. \"I swear they are still as bright as they ever were. The creme de la creme are still as bright but the problem is that they have not had the experience [of reprogramming computers]. They are deprived of the experience,\" he said. \"I want us to have a functioning first-world economy when I am old to pay my state pension and we are not going to have one unless we have engineers. \"It was more just this sense of sadness because we have this culture, particularly in the UK \u2026 we have this engineering culture and we had this amazing thing and then it just went away. \"When we weren't looking, it went away and you could just see that children playing with computers had just gone away and then the adult hobbyist scene was going to go away because if you don't feed it, these things die and it was just this really sad feeling. \"The computer went away and a decade later, the students went away.\" Talking over chess on their Friday afternoon \"happy hours\" in the lab, Upton and his colleagues decided to develop an affordable computer on which children could learn to program. The group soon expanded to include local business people and by 2011 \u2013 after various different incarnations of the Pi \u2013 they came up with a computer deemed worthy of putting into production using hardware from Broadcom, the semiconductor giant where Upton is a chip architect. A short video shown on YouTube detailing how they planned to sell the computer for $25 (\u00a315) garnered 600,000 views, and in turn an urgency to produce the machine, which he described as \"horrific\". In February 2012, orders were taken from the public and in March, the first major delivery of 1,950 Raspberry Pi computers arrived on a palette from China. \"I got one out and plugged it into a telly and it worked and I got another out of a different box and that one worked as well. I turned to one of the trustees and said 'We've made a computer company'. We were just grinning from ear to ear. They all worked and they were all perfect,\" Upton said. The computers themselves are no-nonsense in design and presentation. There are USB ports for a keyboard and mouse, an Ethernet port for the internet, a slot for a memory card and a port to connect the computer to a TV. The operating software is a form of the open-source Linux system. Production was passed over to two British firms which now pay a royalty for each Pi sold. On the first day alone, 100,000 were sold. By October 2012, 1m had been manufactured in Britain, production having transferred from Asia. The biggest market is the United States, where 30% have gone. About 20% are in Britain, another 30% in the rest of Europe \u2013 mostly Germany \u2013 while the rest have mostly gone to Japan and Korea. More than 400,000 of the 2.5m sold are thought to be in the hands of children, while most of them go to adult hobbyists. The organisation behind the Pi is split: a trading company updates the engineering and delivers profits to a foundation which spends it on grants, lobbying and partnerships \u2013 15,000 of the computers were given to schoolchildren for free last year in a deal with Google. So far the Pi has been used by hobbyists for everything from creating a 3D scanner and calibrating temperatures for home brewing to a laddish invention which orders a pizza on the internet via the touch of one outsized button. \"In terms of our initial goals, absolutely [we are happy] because this is an organisation which thought it would sell 1,000 computers. That was the scale of the ambition. If you get them to the right kids, then you only need 1,000 computers if you target them well enough,\" Upton said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Baby boomers, you're off the hook. If you're over 50, don't worry, you cannot be held accountable for the woes of the young. According to Jonathan Portes, the head of the National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research (NIESR), a dissection of the last 30 years tells a different story to the one that appears to be a modern truism: the story that documents the transfer of wealth and income to boomers and berates them for their refusal to share their fortunes. A report last week by the International Longevity Centre-UK (ILC-UK), which looks at pensioner finances and wellbeing, echoes the same theme, arguing that a majority of older people are strapped for cash and cannot be considered affluent. The findings \"provide an important counterbalance to the media coverage about the spending power of postwar generations\", it said. In other words, if you want to debate inequality, then the gap between rich and poor is real whereas the gap between old and young is largely a myth. These two reports are serious attempts to analyse issues in what has become an emotive debate. However, taken together with a recent article under the headline Stop Whingeing \u2013 the young have never had it so good, by the Daily Telegraph's chief economics commentator, Jeremy Warner, they can also be seen as part of a backlash against the anti-boomer argument. Nonetheless, doubts must be raised about their conclusions. As Angus Hanton, founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, says: \"Whilst social and economic inequalities exist within generations undermining social mobility, there is indisputable evidence that ageing and inter-generational transfers are conspiring to suck massive amounts of wealth up the generations in the form of high house prices, high rent demands, generous remuneration packages, protected final-salary pension promises, protected state benefits and exemptions from taxation based solely on age.\" A succession of studies by the charity clearly demonstrates that government policy is systematically taking from the young poor whilst protecting the wealthy old. And it is crucially this point about the wealthy old, who have grown in number in recent years, which is not captured by traditional measures of the economy and the players within it. Portes examines the incomes and wealth of working people versus pensioners over the last few decades to find out whether pensioners are verifiably the winners. He has tracked back from the late 1970s to find that \"only\" 20% of pensioners have an income higher than the \u00a325,000 average for non-retired households. This indicates there are few over 65s with large incomes by comparison with the working population. He looks at the effects of austerity cuts and judges that while pensioners have been protected by Labour and coalition governments by above-inflation rises in the state pension, working-age households without children have escaped cuts and benefited from a similar charmed existence. So there are working-age groups, some of whom will be young, who have suffered as little as pensioners. Turning to the wealth of the over 65s he examines the intergenerational accounts established by Martin Weale, his predecessor at NIESR. Weale is now a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee and spends his working year deciding whether to raise interest rates or not. He backs the view that an older generation has amassed a huge amount of property wealth and is applying a surcharge, in the form of higher house prices, on younger generations. They have also enjoyed a relatively light tax regime and spending bonanza by previous governments compared with younger generations. Portes concedes that the accounts, calculated in 2011, show that those currently over 65 will receive \u00a3220,000 more in spending than they pay in tax over their lifetimes. But he questions the assumptions behind the accounts, which he describes as arbitrary. He argues that younger groups will pay more in tax because they will earn more and consume more, not because taxes are higher. On house prices, he points out that the young will inherit and while this will be distributed unevenly, it represents a cascade of wealth that passes on the gains of the old. University fees? Well, they will hit poorer households, albeit not the young as a group because more affluent parents will use their wealth to subsidise the costs. Again, this makes for a rich and poor argument, not a battle between young and old. This analysis is useful, but the data, which pitches pensioners against the working population, assumes a return to normal growth and re-establishes wealth accumulation among the young, which is a stretch. It also misses the essential point about the baby boomers: most of them have yet to retire. The youngest boomers are turning 50. The oldest are approaching 70. And they have built up vast private pension savings, which are excluded from the analysis. In fact, it is occupational pensions, and final-salary schemes in particular, that have insulated boomers from the downturn and government cuts. In its report with the University of Bristol, the ILC-UK is keen to address more specifically the boomer group and show that we cannot talk about them as a homogeneous unit. Some are up to their eyeballs in debt. Two groups that it calls the Conservative Consumers and Burdened by Bills represent 57% of older consumers. Others may appear affluent but have taken on huge mortgages, not just on their own home, but a string of buy-to-let flats, making them vulnerable to a property crash. There is a quick riposte to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing that pensioner incomes have increased by 50% in real terms since 1994-95, which is to say that pensioners need bigger incomes now they are living so long. According to the ILC-UK's research, the average household wealth of the over 50s is \u00a3541,000, including private and personal pensions, property, financial assets, valuables and deposit savings. This wealth more than halves by the time the household reaches 80. While the ILC-UK draws the conclusion that baby boomers are only acting rationally in amassing fortunes they will need, it raises the question of where all this money comes from. And this is the crux of the argument put forward by Hanton. No one wants to plunge older people into poverty, but there needs to be some recognition that even a relatively middle class among the over 65s represents an unprecedented bill beyond any savings amassed by that group. Last week John Lewis revealed a \u00a31bn deficit in its pensions scheme, which is a sizeable bill to be picked up by the next generation. Premier Foods is in trouble because it too is carrying a \u00a31bn deficit in its occupational scheme. The UK's manufacturing industry is weighed down by such deficits. Our telephone rental bills include a sizeable subsidy for BT's pension fund, which has a \u00a37.3bn deficit. Fearing an almost complete collapse in sectors heavily committed to boomer pension policies, the Pensions Regulator is busy kicking the bills into the long grass. The ILC says the 43% not in its poorest categories are divided into foodies and socialites and those who favour recreation. It is these groups that are new members of the economy. Roll back time and only a few aristocrats lived long enough to enjoy retirement until they were 90. It is not for nothing that ITV3 has back-to-back adverts for cruise holidays. Last week's banishment of BBC3 from the TV schedules is another indication of boomer power. When Snog Marry Avoid gets the channel's highest ratings at 650,100 viewers, and Martin Shaw's George Gently over on BBC One boasts almost 6 million, it was time for BBC3's controller to admit the young are well and truly outgunned by the old.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThey are very hungry,\u201d Andrew Plucinski says in a Polish accent, gesturing to the large glass jars where two dozen black, skinny leeches squiggle wildly in the water or cling motionless to the sides. \u201cThey didn\u2019t eat for about six months.\u201d </p> <p>Plucinski, a leech therapist, is the proprietor of the Silesian Holistic Center in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Center might be too grand a word; it\u2019s a one-man show in a Brooklyn loft. The 58-year-old Plucinski is tall, blond, with light blue eyes and skin more olive than pink. A wall of windows illuminates his high-ceilinged space, partitioned into different areas by freestanding bookshelves of various heights crammed with books on health, diet and detoxification.</p> <p> Plucinski, an immigrant from Poland, places leeches on clients\u2019 bodies to cure ailments, from sciatica to migraines, and for general good health. The designated leeching zone is an intimate space sectioned off to the side by hanging white sheets. Empty metal folding chairs and a cushioned table line the curtained off area where clients typically wait in white robes taking their leeches. Plucinski purchases all his leeches online from leech farms, which are delivered by courier.</p> <p>This seems, to say the least, retro. Blood-sucking leeches are right up there with medieval bloodletting and plague for New Yorkers, the stuff of dusty old folios found in ancient libraries. But for some middle-aged immigrants from eastern Europe or Russia, hirudotherapy is considered an old folk remedy, popular with their grandparents\u2019 generation. Some of them saw jars of leeches at pharmacies as children and remember sick relatives who were treated with leeches behind closed doors.<br></p> <p>The tension between old and new is a big part of Plucinski\u2019s existence. His clinic is in an area that remains, as it has been for decades, predominantly Polish. There are a few hipsters scattered through the neighborhood \u2013 runoff from the $4,000-a-month gentrified lofts of Williamsburg. He\u2019s used to skepticism. </p> <p>\u201cI have been accused of quackery, that I say leeches are good for everything,\u201d concedes Plucinski. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me saying it, it\u2019s the leech industry \u2013 which is huge!\u201d </p> <p>The leech industry does exist, but is difficult to find in the US. Leeches are used in some medical facilities but it\u2019s not exactly advertised and most hirudotherapists like Plucinski are foreign; websites are usually in Polish or Russian.<br><br>Leeching might sound primitive but the FDA approved leeches as \u201cmedical devices\u201d in 2004 to drain pooled blood after surgery. The most common use is after a digit replant (when a severed digit is surgically reattached) and reconstructive flap surgery, similar to a skin graft. Leeches suck out the pooling blood, known as venous congestion. If oxygenated blood can\u2019t reach the digit or skin flap tissue because of pooled blood, it dies, which results in amputation or removal.</p> <p>\u201cThis is going to sound hokey,\u201d says Dr Matthew Carty, a plastic surgeon at Brigham &amp; Women\u2019s Faulkner Hospital in Boston who occasionally uses leeches, \u201cbut it\u2019s really a reflection of the majesty of nature. With all of our science and technology, there is this organism in nature that can do just as good a job in terms of serving this function as the most advanced surgical techniques we have.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9aa2a3a8-6ccc-40c2-8be1-84965e25089d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/7/1394230881259/e5cd738d-7b14-4a6b-9985-309d78a87071-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Leeches squirm in a dish at the International Medical Leech Centre, not far from Moscow.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leeches squirm in a dish at the International Medical Leech Centre, not far from Moscow. Photograph: Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Cincinnati, Ohio, Dr Aletha Tippett who is a general practitioner uses leeches to help with patients\u2019 varicose veins, neuropathy, and blocked arteries. Leeches are also used for pain reduction; Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City treated knee osteoarthritis with leeches for several years. Patients felt less pain and had greater movement in their knees according to the director Dr Arya Nielsen, but the program ended because of time constraints and funding considerations; leeches are not covered by insurance.</p> <p>Some doctors who are familiar with leeching shrug their shoulders at a hirudotherapist like Plucinski using leeches, while others don\u2019t approve of the little bloodsuckers making money for someone without a medical degree. Manhattan-based plastic surgeon Dr Kari Colen is alarmed at the idea. \u201cYou can get serious infections from leeches,\u201d says Dr Colen, as leeches have a bacteria in their gut. She says antibiotics must be used despite leeches being bought from leech farms. \u201cIf a doctor used a leech and didn\u2019t treat with antibiotics, it\u2019s against standard of care,\u201d she notes, \u201cSo how is it appropriate for people with no medical license to go around and do it?\u201c</p> <h2>\u2018Less gasses\u2019</h2> <p>This kind of objection exasperates Plucinski. He counters that leeches have been used for thousands of years, long before the invention of antibiotics. \u201cPharos were cured with leeches!\u201d he booms. He reports that none of his clients have ever contracted an infection from a leech. Plucinski believes the only reason doctors object to a person like him using leeches is because he\u2019s \u201crobbing them of their Mercedes\u201d, as leeching is a fraction of the price of traditional medicine.</p> <p>According to Plucinski 98% of all heath problems can be cured through leeches, diet and annual colonics. He claims to have helped one client with paralysis walk without his two canes after eight sessions; another client, he says, was spared a triple bypass surgery; ovarian cysts were said to have disappeared from another. More modest improvements include better sleep, metabolism, and energy and \u201cless gasses\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLeeches work on many different levels,\u201d explains Plucinski. \u201cYou feel pain there, you put a leech there,\u201d he states plainly \u2013 on the knee for a torn meniscus, on the gums for a gum infection, and it\u2019s obvious where they\u2019d go for hemorrhoids.</p> <p>In addition to localized leech application, he\u2019ll place leeches on the body\u2019s meridians, similar to acupuncture. Leeches attach themselves by biting, which feels like a pinprick. It then pumps in saliva that acts as an anticoagulant and anasthetic, and sucks out lymphatic fluid mixed with blood, according to Plucinski. When a leech becomes engorged, sometimes four times its original size, it either falls off or is removed after 10 to 30 minutes.</p> <p>After the leech has sucked up all it can, Plucinski dunks each leech in alcohol so it dies and it\u2019s disposed of; leeches are only used once. The tiny wound oozes about two to three tablespoons of bright red fluid for several hours, which Plucinski says is more lymphatic fluid than blood.</p> <p>Client Marzena Bugaj is from Poland and found him through word of mouth, like most of his clients. She suffered from migraines and vertigo, and her prescribed medication produced severe stomach bacteria. Since her extended family used leeches when she was young, coupled with being desperate, she opted for leeching.</p> <p>\u201cDo I like them? No!\u201d stresses Bugaj, describing how they latched on behind her ears, but she no longer has migraines or vertigo and the bacteria disappeared since she stopped taking medication.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6bb8364c-a606-45a9-97af-ee9abfeee634\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/7/1394221748975/fcb2a064-f45b-4d1f-8756-2a34d042b2df-460x276.png\" alt=\"Leech on palm\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A leech before it goes to work. Photograph: Nina Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Could these impressive results be the placebo effect? A mind-body reaction to a designated healer who patiently listens, gives advice, often in a client\u2019s mother tongue?</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d replies Plucinski flatly, \u201cWe are talking about detoxification.\u201d He believes that the pharmaceutical and medical \u201cmafias\u201d as he calls them, mask symptoms rather than fix problems.</p> <p>What does he call varicose vein surgery? \u201cExtortion!\u201d</p> <p>Even the dermatologist Dr. Zizmor who advertises his acne cures all over the city\u2019s subway cars doesn\u2019t escape Plucinski\u2019s growing wrath, \u201cMoron! It\u2019s all about cleaning the liver!\u201d</p> <h2>\u201cIf Dr Oz says \u2018leech,\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d</h2> <p>Plucinski hasn\u2019t always worked with leeches. After arriving in the US as a refugee in 1980 and briefly cleaning toilets for minimum wage, he had a lucrative career as a private investigator. He made the ill-timed transition into residential real estate development in 2008; he says he lost $3m dollars in the ensuing housing crash.</p> <p>Leech therapy might not be everyone\u2019s obvious back-up career move, but Plucinski had been fascinated and actively researching body detoxification and leeching since the mid 1980s. His own knee \u2013 mangled from a skiing accident \u2013 was cured with leeches by a fellow Polish immigrant. \u201cThat was 1990, and I\u2019m still skiing,\u201d says Plucinski proudly. After attending a leech training program in Poland he opened for business in 2009.</p> <p>About 85% of his clientele is foreign-born, from Russian housewives to Orthodox rabbis from Israel. The Americans tend to be those who were treated with leeches abroad or open to alternative medicine. Plucinski recognizes that in order for leeching to gain greater acceptance in the US, it needs some Americanized help.</p> <p>\u201cIf I say to the average American, \u2018leech\u2019 they would say \u2018Ugh!\u2019\u201d says Plucinski, mimicking the stereotypically easily disgusted American. \u201cIf Dr Oz says it,\u201d pauses Plucinski referencing the celebrity TV doctor, changing his demeanor to adoration, \u201cit\u2019s, \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Plucinski believes Americans could warm up to leeching if it\u2019s introduced through a safe vehicle like talk shows. Still, leeches have been featured on Dr Oz several times, and actress Demi Moore, a leech enthusiast herself, made the talk show rounds several years ago, but Americans are not exactly flocking to Silesian Holistic Center. Out of frustration Plucinski can go on a digressive riff about America being the only \u201cbigot\u201d country to turn its nose up to leeching.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if leeching gains widespread acceptance as acupuncture has. Plucinski is hopeful, but even if mainstream America doesn\u2019t catch on en masse, there are enough immigrants in New York City who come from eastern Europe and Russia, among other countries, to provide Plucinski\u2019s leeches a steady flow of blood.</p>",

He counters that leeches have been used for thousands of years, long before the invention of antibiotics. \u201cPharos were cured with leeches!\u201d he booms. He reports that none of his clients have ever contracted an infection from a leech. Plucinski believes the only reason doctors object to a person like him using leeches is because he\u2019s \u201crobbing them of their Mercedes\u201d, as leeching is a fraction of the price of traditional medicine. According to Plucinski 98% of all heath problems can be cured through leeches, diet and annual colonics. He claims to have helped one client with paralysis walk without his two canes after eight sessions; another client, he says, was spared a triple bypass surgery; ovarian cysts were said to have disappeared from another. More modest improvements include better sleep, metabolism, and energy and \u201cless gasses\u201d. \u201cLeeches work on many different levels,\u201d explains Plucinski. \u201cYou feel pain there, you put a leech there,\u201d he states plainly \u2013 on the knee for a torn meniscus, on the gums for a gum infection, and it\u2019s obvious where they\u2019d go for hemorrhoids. In addition to localized leech application, he\u2019ll place leeches on the body\u2019s meridians, similar to acupuncture. Leeches attach themselves by biting, which feels like a pinprick. It then pumps in saliva that acts as an anticoagulant and anasthetic, and sucks out lymphatic fluid mixed with blood, according to Plucinski. When a leech becomes engorged, sometimes four times its original size, it either falls off or is removed after 10 to 30 minutes. After the leech has sucked up all it can, Plucinski dunks each leech in alcohol so it dies and it\u2019s disposed of; leeches are only used once. The tiny wound oozes about two to three tablespoons of bright red fluid for several hours, which Plucinski says is more lymphatic fluid than blood. Client Marzena Bugaj is from Poland and found him through word of mouth, like most of his clients. She suffered from migraines and vertigo, and her prescribed medication produced severe stomach bacteria. Since her extended family used leeches when she was young, coupled with being desperate, she opted for leeching. \u201cDo I like them? No!\u201d stresses Bugaj, describing how they latched on behind her ears, but she no longer has migraines or vertigo and the bacteria disappeared since she stopped taking medication. Could these impressive results be the placebo effect? A mind-body reaction to a designated healer who patiently listens, gives advice, often in a client\u2019s mother tongue? \u201cNo,\u201d replies Plucinski flatly, \u201cWe are talking about detoxification.\u201d He believes that the pharmaceutical and medical \u201cmafias\u201d as he calls them, mask symptoms rather than fix problems. What does he call varicose vein surgery? \u201cExtortion!\u201d Even the dermatologist Dr. Zizmor who advertises his acne cures all over the city\u2019s subway cars doesn\u2019t escape Plucinski\u2019s growing wrath, \u201cMoron! It\u2019s all about cleaning the liver!\u201d \u201cIf Dr Oz says \u2018leech,\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d Plucinski hasn\u2019t always worked with leeches. After arriving in the US as a refugee in 1980 and briefly cleaning toilets for minimum wage, he had a lucrative career as a private investigator. He made the ill-timed transition into residential real estate development in 2008; he says he lost $3m dollars in the ensuing housing crash. Leech therapy might not be everyone\u2019s obvious back-up career move, but Plucinski had been fascinated and actively researching body detoxification and leeching since the mid 1980s. His own knee \u2013 mangled from a skiing accident \u2013 was cured with leeches by a fellow Polish immigrant. \u201cThat was 1990, and I\u2019m still skiing,\u201d says Plucinski proudly. After attending a leech training program in Poland he opened for business in 2009. About 85% of his clientele is foreign-born, from Russian housewives to Orthodox rabbis from Israel. The Americans tend to be those who were treated with leeches abroad or open to alternative medicine. Plucinski recognizes that in order for leeching to gain greater acceptance in the US, it needs some Americanized help. \u201cIf I say to the average American, \u2018leech\u2019 they would say \u2018Ugh!\u2019\u201d says Plucinski, mimicking the stereotypically easily disgusted American. \u201cIf Dr Oz says it,\u201d pauses Plucinski referencing the celebrity TV doctor, changing his demeanor to adoration, \u201cit\u2019s, \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d Plucinski believes Americans could warm up to leeching if it\u2019s introduced through a safe vehicle like talk shows. Still, leeches have been featured on Dr Oz several times, and actress Demi Moore, a leech enthusiast herself, made the talk show rounds several years ago, but Americans are not exactly flocking to Silesian Holistic Center. Out of frustration Plucinski can go on a digressive riff about America being the only \u201cbigot\u201d country to turn its nose up to leeching. It remains to be seen if leeching gains widespread acceptance as acupuncture has. Plucinski is hopeful, but even if mainstream America doesn\u2019t catch on en masse, there are enough immigrants in New York City who come from eastern Europe and Russia, among other countries, to provide Plucinski\u2019s leeches a steady flow of blood.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of BT engineers, call centre workers and other frontline staff are to share a \u00a31.3bn windfall when a five-year employee share scheme vests this summer, with many receiving \"life-changing\" amounts. Thanks to a dramatic rise in the phone company's stock market value, some 24,000 BT workers, equivalent to one-third of BT's British workforce, will join middle and senior managers in sharing profits averaging over \u00a346,000. Staff were offered the chance to buy into BT's sharesave scheme at a fixed price, which averaged 66p. Last week, after a turnaround in BT's fortunes under former chief executive Ian Livingston, those shares were worth 401p each. \"Secretarial staff, drivers and engineers paying off their mortgages \u2013 people write to me and say it's changed their lives,\" Livingston told the Sunday Times. Some 332m shares from the scheme are due to vest this summer, allowing staff to share in a total pot worth \u00a31.33bn if the share price stays at its current level. Those who invested the maximum \u2013 \u00a3225 a month over five years \u2013 will receive shares worth \u00a382,000, netting a profit of about \u00a368,500. Many of those to benefit are in frontline posts, with 60% of the windfall recipients working in what BT describes as team-level jobs. The balance are middle and senior managers. When Livingston took control at BT in 2008, one of his first tasks was to announce a profits warning, which sent shares crashing 19%. Costs had risen out of control at BT's global services unit, which serves corporate customers, and the company faced a crippling deficit in its pension scheme. Livingston's cost-cutting put BT on a firmer footing. One of the areas where BT saved money was scrapping free shares for rank and file employees \u2013 the allshare scheme was cancelled in 2008, with staff given free home broadband instead. Savings across the company allowed BT to invest in its broadband network, with \u00a32.5bn allocated to bring superfast fibre optic cables to street cabinets serving 19m premises, and more recently in football rights. BT dealt a significant blow to BSkyB in November after outbidding the satellite broadcaster for rights to the Champions League, one of television's most high profile football events, paying almost \u00a3900m for the rights. The company is already spending \u00a3246m a year on Premier League matches, and an estimated \u00a325m a year on FA Cup rights, and has built a lavish broadcasting studio for the BT Sports channels at the former Olympic park in Stratford. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's has announced that 11,000 staff will share \u00a38m from the retailer's sharesave scheme, with some workers receiving around \u00a310,000 each. \"It's a great way to share our success with colleagues working right across our business,\" said Justin King, chief executive of Sainsbury's.",

True, there are those who recall having to wait to get the old, nationalised BT to install a new line; but I seem to remember that in those days if your phone was out of order, you merely rang a three-digit number and called an engineer. Nowadays it requires endless calls and a truly Kafkaesque routine of questions and \"procedures\". When the man from Shelter knocked on the door to talk about the housing crisis \u2013 about which I feel strongly \u2013 I fear I told him it was not the right moment. Then he, too, recounted a similar episode with BT. The following day I raised the subject with a fellow passenger on a train. \"It's the same with Virgin,\" he said. Yes, the advice to shop around \u2013 who wants to shop around for what should be a service from a public utility? \u2013 does not necessarily get one very far. I fear there is a wider problem with modern management. They outsource to cut costs and make life difficult for the customer. And part of their secret is to make the consumer do the work. Indeed, I am lost in admiration for the way some modern businesses have managed to force so many people to \"go online\" and do the things that the business itself should be doing if it really wanted to provide a \"service\". What has this to do with the economy, I hear you ask. Well, quite a lot. One can hardly switch on the radio or pick up a newspaper without coming across the subject of \"productivity\" but, frankly, I do not think all modern business practices are productive. The biggest joke is that the originators of the drive towards privatisation \u2013 Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher \u2013 somehow convinced themselves that the future of the British economy lay with the development of \"services\". Jim Prior, employment secretary in Thatcher's first cabinet, wrote of the Treasury ministers at the time: \"None of them had any experience of running a whelk stall, let alone a decent-sized company. Their attitude to manufacturing industry bordered on the contemptuous. They shared the view of the other monetarists in the cabinet \u2013 that we were better suited as a nation to being a service economy and should no longer worry about production.\" Decades later, a Conservative-led coalition has finally recognised the importance of manufacturing. Manufacturing and services are interdependent, a kind of matrix. Modern economies need both. But there has been much neglect, under governments of both main parties. As the veteran Labour MP Michael Meacher says in his eminently readable new book, The State We Need \u2013 Keys to the Renaissance of Britain: \"Any sustainable growth of living standards can only be built on a strong and resilient manufacturing base. Therefore rebuilding that badly weakened manufacturing capacity, halved in the last 30 neoliberal years, should be made an overriding aim for the next Labour government.\" The next Labour government? Or the next coalition? Political commentators, and indeed politicians themselves, are avidly speculating about the outcome of the next general election, although thanks to George Osborne's original insistence on a fixed, five-year term, we still have over a year to go. There is much talk of coalitions, although traditionally these were considered extraordinarily difficult to contrive, outside wartime, because of the way our electoral system worked. Indeed, last weekend marked the 40th anniversary of the day Sir Edward Heath, Tory prime minister from 1970 to 1974, left office after coalition negotiations with the Liberals broke down. And next month marks the anniversary of what many consider to have been the birth of the movement that led to the rise of Thatcher. The two biggest-spending ministers in the Heath government had been Joseph, secretary of state for social security, and Thatcher, secretary for education. It was in April 1974 that Joseph underwent his \"conversion\" to neoliberal policies, and embarked on a path towards the leadership. But, after some injudicious speeches on the subjects of unemployment and contraception, he withdrew and Thatcher took up the baton (a subject due to be explored on 7 April in a Radio 4 programme: Thatcher's Mad Monk or True Prophet?) The rest is, in that well-worn but useful cliche, history. But what may be of interest to those who devote so much attention to manifesto commitments is the experience of this country in the runup to the 1979 general election and afterwards. Until that election, the sado-monetarist and neoliberal mission of Thatcher and Joseph (the latter actually wanted to abolish the Department of Trade and Industry, of which he was nominally in charge from 1979) was largely concealed from the British public \u2013 just as, more recently, was Nick Clegg's ultimate position on university tuition fees.

      "bodyText": "As the Formula One circus gets back on the track in Melbourne for the first race of the 2014 season next Sunday, nerves will be tauter than ever. In recent years the sport has been dominated by the Red Bull Racing team and its driver Sebastian Vettel, who clinched his fourth consecutive drivers' championship in 2013. But some of the biggest rule changes in the sport's history have made the season ahead far more unpredictable. This year, the 2.4 litre V8 engines that have been in use since 2006 are being replaced by 1.6 litre V6 engines, with far stricter limits on fuel consumption. All the teams are facing a huge technical challenge as they adapt to the changes, and race strategy will be crucial. Red Bull has come up against some problems in preseason testing, but Melbourne is where \"the bullshit stops\", according to team principal Christian Horner. Sitting in his office in Milton Keynes, Horner says: \"This year is slightly more of an unknown because it is such a big regulation change, and of course certain engine suppliers will have got it right and some will have got it wrong. There will be a race against time [among teams] to get themselves in the best position they can.\" He adds that it could be \"a few months\" into the 2014 season before a pattern of winners and losers emerges. While the winning and losing will be played out on 19 tracks around the world, much of the work that goes into those performances will be carried out in the UK, in \"motorsport valley\", a business cluster in and around Oxfordshire. \"The garage at the grand prix is our shop window, but it's what goes on behind the scenes that makes the difference,\" says Horner. As in past seasons, eight of the 11 teams racing in 2014 are based in the UK, including big names such as Red Bull, McLaren, Mercedes and Lotus. Britain has a dominant position in racing, and this stretches beyond the F1 teams to an entire supply chain feeding off the sport. The figures speak for themselves. Motorsport valley is home to around 4,300 companies, employing around 41,000 people and with a combined annual turnover of around \u00a39bn, according to the UK's Motorsport Industry Association (MIA). Almost 90% of those companies export their products and services abroad. Chris Aylett, the MIA's chief executive, says Britain's position at the forefront of F1 is the result of \"accident and circumstance\" stemming from the 1950s and 1960s, when the country had plenty of airstrips and aspiring engineers. \"After the war, we had very little money but a lot of airfields that had not been bombed,\" he says. \"We had engineers who were experienced in rapid research and development, aerodynamics and competitive engineering \u2013 and a lot of them turned their hands to automobile engineering.\" Competition in the sport has always been fierce. In the 1950s Enzo Ferrari, the driver and entrepreneur behind the Italian racing team and luxury car company, dismissed some of the new British outfits as garagisti, mere \"garage teams\". The modern sport looks very different, with F1 highly regulated and success in the UK built around motorsport valley and the Silverstone circuit in Northamptonshire. But the fierce competition remains, and those at the top of the sport argue that the benefits of Britain's dominance of many aspects of F1 have a wider impact on the economy, in terms of jobs, skills and innovation. Horner says F1 is \"a shining example\" of engineering excellence in Britain. \"A lot of the teams and suppliers permeated out of Silverstone, and the UK has had a great heritage of creative design engineers and manufacturing.\" Now, the innovation that comes from competing to build a winning car is being applied elsewhere. As well as McLaren Automotive, which produces luxury road cars for the super-rich, spinoff McLaren Applied Technologies (MAT) is using some of the lessons learned from F1 in other industries. McLaren boss Ron Dennis says that while \"racing will always be at our heart\", the demands of the sport put it at the forefront of broader innovation. \"Formula One breaks new ground and other industries follow. And because of the concentration of Formula One in the UK, we have a significant advantage.\" MAT works with companies in several industries, such as healthcare, but it is also transferring its expertise to other sports. \"The UK has punched above its weight in recent Olympic Games, and a small amount of that success is attributable to Formula One,\" says Dennis. He cites McLaren's work in sports including cycling, sailing, canoeing, rowing, bobsleigh and skeleton, where its engineers help with improving equipment and enhancing the way athletes approach training and racing. \"Across those sports,\" he adds, \"we have helped win 32 medals, 17 of which have been gold.\" Other F1 teams are diversifying, too. Williams has taken motorsport expertise into sectors including mass transport, particularly the use of energy-efficient technologies. Claire Williams, deputy team principal and commercial director at Williams, says the cluster of high-value, hi-tech engineering companies in motorsport valley dispels the notion that \"Britain doesn't make things any more\". Ultimately though, while the glamour of F1 racing will undoubtedly attract aspiring engineers, the sport can have only a limited impact on the engineering skills shortage bemoaned by Britain's manufacturers. \"For many years,\" says Dennis, \"if you were bright enough to become a top-class engineer, you were also bright enough to know that there were probably better career options available in the City. Formula One has always been a relatively small, but important, counter to that suction pump of talent.\" This is not to say that F1 teams are taking an altruistic approach to the skills shortage \u2013 the benefit to the wider economy of its innovation and the fact it fits in with the government's agenda are purely coincidental. Horner says: \"We don't get involved in politics. Our job is to be a sporting team, a racing team, and our focus is very much on going racing. But David Cameron recognises clearly the value of engineering in Formula One.\" For now, though, a week before the first race at Melbourne, all teams have their minds on the battles ahead. The outcome is likely to depend on the performance of the all-new engines, particularly those built by major suppliers Mercedes, Renault and Ferrari. \"Everyone is excited about this season,\" says Tim Urquhart, automotive analyst at IHS. \"It will be about the engine, and the team that integrates it best into the chassis will probably win.\" Pre-season tests indicate that the Mercedes engines \u2013 used not only by Mercedes but also McLaren and Williams \u2013 have the edge, followed by Ferrari and then those from Renault, used by Red Bull, Lotus and Caterham. Dennis says F1 fans should expect \"some exciting racing and real twists and turns\" this season. \"About the only certainty this year is that we all face a lot of uncertainty. All of our talented engineers have worked incredibly hard over the winter and will continue to do so as we fight for every single point.\" While there are greater unknowns this season, the chances are the first driver to cross the finishing line in Melbourne in a week's time will be from a British-based team, in a British-designed car.",

This policy might have worked in the short term, but it bodes badly for the future. Last week, George Osborne was confronted by a forecast that the public finances will be \u00a320bn shy of his last estimate, largely because low productivity will slow the recovery and rob him of tax receipts.</p> <p>Research by the <em>Financial Times</em>, using a model like that adopted by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), finds that the UK's capacity for growth in future has deteriorated and a cyclically adjusted deficit target of \u00a385bn for 2013-14 will need to be ditched in favour of the actual \u00a3111bn deficit.</p> <p>The OBR's boss, Robert Chote, has lamented that much of the UK's lost productivity cannot be considered cyclical, but lost forever.

      "bodyText": "It's 10 years this weekend since Sir Ken Morrison's peerless effort at rallying Safeway's troops, following his eponymous supermarket chain's takeover of its rival. His talk went along the lines of: \"Yorkshiremen are superior to everybody else, so you southern layabouts will now be doing things my way\". Then he formally welcomed his new charges to the Morrison family with the refrain: \"This is not a merger. It's a takeover.\" The result was collapsing morale and dear old Ken being widely lampooned \u2013 via wheezes such as the circulation of fake HR forms inviting Safeway staff to state their birthplace as \"(a) Bradford, (b) Yorkshire or (c) somewhere down south\". All of which is something for current boss Dalton Philips to consider as he attempts to improve the moods of shareholders and staff this week, at the struggling retailer's full-year results. Morrisons has been dogged by its lack of internet shopping and convenience stores plus its inadequate IT \u2013 all of which it claims to be fixing. But the real issue facing most grocers is how to repel the Germans, in the form of discounters Aldi and Lidl. The only response the industry seems to have is what it haughtily calls \"investing in prices\". But blunt northerners use a different phrase: for them it's cutting prices and margins. Hell and high water \u2013 but guess who's still smiling Here's a quiz question for you: after a winter of floods and storms, how much lower are the share prices of the general insurers? Five per cent? Ten maybe? Actually, for the most part they haven't fallen at all: the majority have gained plenty over the winter months. Admiral and Aviva are up almost 20% since the end of November; Direct Line is up 14%, Legal &amp; General 12% and esure \u2013 which is due to report this week, a year after its underwhelming float \u2013 10%. The reasons are manifold, according to industry watchers. All the players have reinsured themselves to a greater or lesser extent (which either cuts margins or puts up premiums); and insurers increasingly treat those living on flood plains as though they're boy racers with souped-up motors \u2013 and avoid insuring them completely. Meanwhile, the market in car insurance has been woeful \u2013 but it's cyclical and some reckon it might soon start to rise. And, finally, firms have been more conservative, particularly when it comes to cash held back to cover claims, which many have over-estimated. It all reads like a remarkable success story for the industry. That cannot be true, can it? Reappearance of the Bank's Mr Bean Call off the search! Charlie Bean, the soon-to-be-former deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been discovered safe and well. You'll recall how concern for his welfare was mounting after a near full house of Bean's monetary policy committee colleagues were dispatched to make high-profile media appearances, with Charlie mysteriously excluded. But he's back this week, having bagged the glamour gig addressing the North-East Chamber of Commerce's president's club in Darlington. As is the Bank of England's custom these days, Bean's turn will be just one of the numerous attractions on another packed bill of appearances by Threadneedle Street's star names. On Tuesday, the Treasury select committee will take evidence on inflation from governor Mark Carney, executive director Paul Fisher and external members David Miles and Martin Weale. Immediately after that, the MPs will ask Carney about his recent speech on Scottish independence, before hauling Carney back to the stand again, this time with Fisher, to talk about the Bank's own inquiry into foreign exchange rigging. Still, the big question remains: will they all be upstaged by Charlie's comeback?",
