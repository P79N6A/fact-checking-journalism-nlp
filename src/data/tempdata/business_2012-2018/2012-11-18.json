      "bodyText": "In terms of gender balance at the top, the Bank of England is as bad as UK plc. The nine members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) are all men, as are the 11 members of the financial policy committee (FPC). Threadneedle Street has three governors and 10 other executive directors, of whom only one \u2013 the HR boss, Catherine Brown \u2013 is a woman. Lady Rice is the only non-male among the dozen members of the Bank's court of governors. The Bank and the Treasury, jointly responsible for choosing candidates for key roles, say no bias is involved and that they are trying hard to find women who can set interest rates or keep the City in line. Try a bit harder, chaps. It is really not good enough that a body with such power, and which relies so heavily on public trust, should be so unrepresentative of the population it is serving. The selection of Sharon Bowles as the next governor would help make the Bank look less like a gentlemen's club, but she is unlikely to be the one named by George Osborne in the next few weeks. Bowles is a Liberal Democrat and chair of the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, both reasons for the chancellor to look elsewhere. The Old Lady will have to wait for her first chatelaine. Several other candidates are in the running. Originally, Osborne \u2013 who is expected to announce his decision in his autumn statement on 5 December \u2013 wanted Mark Carney, the highly regarded governor of the Bank of Canada, but his overtures were rebuffed. Carney's name is still mentioned in the list of runners and riders, as is that of Glenn Stevens, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The financial systems of Canada and Australia stood up better than most during the crisis of 2007-09, and oversight of the City is now central to the expanded role given to the Bank of England by the coalition. The fact that the names of Carney and Stevens refuse to go away despite protestations from both men that they are not interested suggests the Treasury is not entirely convinced about the credentials of the UK frontrunners. This impression has been reinforced by reports that a former permanent secretary to the Treasury, Lord Burns, was prepared to do the job on a temporary basis. Burns, 68, is said to be reluctant to commit himself to a full eight-year term, but offered to do four years instead. As with Bowles, pro-European proclivities may also count against Lord Turner, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, even though he has now recanted his former support for the euro. Turner would certainly be the most radical choice, and has made it clear that the Bank may need to rummage even deeper in its box of unconventional policy measures to prevent the economy sliding into deflation. Although he has yet to spell out in public quite what he means, Turner would consider \"helicopter drops\" of money if things got bad enough. This would involve tax cuts from the Treasury paid for with cash provided by the Bank. The current governor, Sir Mervyn King, used a recent speech in Cardiff to rain on this idea from a great height, which may be one reason why Turner has drifted out in the betting. The City is also lobbying hard against the FSA chairman following his wholly justified comment that much of what the financial sector does is \"socially useless\". Ultimately, though,But Osborne might still pick Turner if he thinks the Bank's current policy tools \u2013 ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 are proving ineffective in lifting the economy out of its current rut. The man the City would like for the job is Paul Tucker, one of King's two deputies. There was a lot of tension between the Bank and the financial sector in the early days of the crisis, with Bob Diamond of Barclays accusing King of delivering sermons on moral hazard rather than support for struggling banks. Tucker was seen as much more willing to help, which is why the City has been lobbying Osborne strongly on his behalf. Tucker was, however, dragged into the Libor rate-fixing scandal, and the chancellor will have to be sure that none of that mud will stick. Sir John Vickers is the dark horse in the race. He is the candidate most like the current governor: a first-rate economist, although specialising in micro-economics rather than the big-picture stuff. He has been chief economist at the Bank, run the Office of Fair Trading and chaired the Independent Commission on Banking, set up by Osborne, which called for the high-street operations of banks to be ringfenced from their investment arms. There is a suspicion, though, that Vickers is not really hungry for the governorship in the way that Tucker and Turner are, and is happier running an Oxford college than he would be the Bank of England. It is certainly a big job. The FPC must ensure that tougher prudential regulations to ensure the City does not blow up the economy again are not so draconian as to choke off lending altogether. There is a tension between long-term strategy and short-term tactics. The task facing the MPC is trickier. Britain could easily slide into a triple-dip recession this winter despite interest rates of 0.5% and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing (QE). Yet, despite the weakness of the recovery, inflation is 2.7% and has been above its 2% target for 69 of the past 78 months. Public confidence, according to the Bank's regular surveys, is at its lowest ebb since it was granted operational independence 15 years ago. King said last week that the MPC had not lost its faith in QE, a clear hint that there will be further asset purchases if growth is lower than expected. On past form it will be, as the Bank's forecasting record is poor, consistently over-estimating growth and under-estimating inflation. But is more QE really what the economy needs? At a global level, it seems as if money creation by central banks has pushed up commodity prices, adding to the price of food and reducing real incomes, stifling economic recovery. Yet, many households and businesses are in a zombie-like state where they are so heavily reliant on a fix of cheap money that they would go to the wall without it. Macro-economic policy is a mess: it is not working effectively, it is nurturing a dependency culture and there is no obvious exit strategy. As to who will get the job, the Treasury is giving little away, but those who have bumped into Tucker recently say he is looking remarkably cheerful. He is also odds-on with the bookies, and they are usually right.",

    "webTitle": "BA's Spanish marriage flies into financial difficulties", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When flag carriers flew the world like proud extensions of government foreign policy, the merger of British Airways and its Spanish counterpart Iberia would have been unthinkable. But the advent of Ryanair, easyJet and other low-cost ingenues, followed by the dent in demand caused by 9/11, exposed them to the unforgiving economics of modern aviation. The industry has lost $25bn (\u00a316bn) since 2001, in a decade littered with redundancies, financial restructurings and bankruptcies. The formation of International Airlines Group (IAG) through the merger of BA and Iberia in 2011 was supposed to muster strength from an imperilled business model. The group would earn more revenue for less cost, while pooling expensive overheads such as buying aircraft. Speaking as BA chief executive at the time, Willie Walsh, now chief executive of IAG, said BA would benefit from adding Latin America to its lucrative transatlantic routes. \"We are very pleased to have the combined network of BA and Iberia,\" he added. It is now clear that one half of IAG entered this modern marriage still rooted in an earlier era. According to IAG's nine-month results, BA made an operating profit of \u20ac286m (\u00a3229m), bolstered by its UK-US routes and the accumulated benefit of years of cost-cutting, including a bitter industrial dispute with cabin crew in 2010. Iberia, on the other hand, nearly wiped out BA's gains with an operating loss of \u20ac262m. This month Walsh inadvertently confirmed how far Iberia lags behind BA as he warned that the partner airline was in a \"fight for survival\". He used the same phrase about BA three years ago in the months before the crew dispute. Further upheaval is on the way. Walsh said he would cut 4,500 jobs at Iberia \u2013 20% of the workforce \u2013 and shed a quarter of its aircraft fleet in a bid to stem losses running at \u20ac1.7m a day. In Madrid, the feeling among Iberia workers is that their airline is very much the junior partner in IAG. They see IAG's recent \u20ac113m offer to take over profitable low-cost Spanish carrier Vueling as an indication of where Iberia is heading. Their concerns are adding new members to a generation of indignados alarmed by an economic slump that has left one in four adults on the on the dole. Trade unions are determined to fight the plans. \"This isn't a plan to fix Iberia but dismantle it,\" said Manuel Atienza, who has been a flight attendant for 40 years and is a spokesman for the UGT union federation. \"If anyone thinks we are scared and resigned, they are very much mistaken.\" The Spanish pilots' union, Sepla, has long had a reputation for industrial muscle and a gathering of 1,000 of its Iberia members voted last week to reject the redundancies and demand a demerger of BA and Iberia. Maria L\u00f3pez, who has worked as an Iberia flight attendant with Iberia for 35 years, complained that workers were suffering the consequences of management decisions and circumstances beyond their control. \"The mood is one of deep sadness, as well as anger and indignation,\" she said. \"We understand that many airlines are running at a loss in the current economic situation and have loss-making routes, but I don't think this is the way to solve it. There is a lot of shared responsibility and it doesn't make sense to go after the weakest \u2013 and 4,500 is a lot of people.\" While Iberia staff are counting the cost in terms of thousands of colleagues, for shareholders it could be in the millions of pounds. A footnote in IAG's first-half results, published in the summer, refers to an \"impairment review\" that could lead to a writedown of Iberia, whose goodwill and brand is valued at more than \u20ac500m on IAG's books. Defending the deal, IAG points to a strengthened combined balance sheet and says Iberia has gained from \u20ac101m in \"synergies\" since the merger. Antonio Sanchez, a retired Iberia economist, said the carrier's demise would have far-reaching economic repercussions in a country that depends on tourism for more than 10% of its economic output: \"It just isn't the same when you no longer have a flagship. St Louis, Missouri suffered terribly after the collapse of TWA, because there are a lot of secondary services linked with a flagship. Pilots' schools have to close, you have no bargaining power over routes.\" Attempts to restructure Iberia may not prove an easy fight, even for a man of Walsh's reputation for enjoying the battle. Employees will be looking with interest at developments at Heathrow, where BA's management are reluctantly moving to union recognition for the \"mixed fleet\" of cabin crew. The fact that this tranche of staff, established by BA in 2010 to undercut the pay and conditions traditionally enjoyed by its crew, has rapidly unionised suggests that not even eager young recruits are willing or able to sustain the flexible working demands their bosses want to impose. Stock market analysts are largely supporters of airline consolidation along the lines of IAG, Air France/KLM and the shopaholic Lufthansa, which has brought Swiss and Austrian Airlines under its wing in recent years. Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, said: \"There can be no doubt that the scale of the Spanish downturn was not part of the game plan when BA originally combined with Iberia.\" However, he added that Spain's economic troubles and Iberia's losses gave Walsh the opportunity to correct those problems quickly: \"The original logic of the combination continues to have merit: it combines BA's strength position on the mature North Atlantic market with Iberia's strong position in the fast growing South Atlantic market.\" Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Esp\u00edrito Santo, has warned that the market has underestimated the scale of the problems facing Iberia, but agrees that progress towards consolidation is inevitable. \"The strategic logic of consolidation is still there, as is the attractiveness of Iberia's Latin American network,\" said Khoo. Walsh himself puts it as starkly as ever: \"Consolidation is inevitable in our industry.\" Walsh remains bullish about the deal, telling the Observer this month that he had \"no regrets at linking up with Iberia \u2013 not at all\". But he is now seeking savings on a more significant scale, and warned: \"No airline can guarantee its survival. And the reality is that Iberia cannot continue in its present form.\"",

Walsh said he would cut 4,500 jobs at Iberia \u2013 20% of the workforce \u2013 and shed a quarter of its aircraft fleet in a bid to stem losses running at \u20ac1.7m a day.</p> <p>In Madrid, the feeling among Iberia workers is that their airline is very much the junior partner in IAG. They see IAG's recent \u20ac113m offer to take over profitable low-cost Spanish carrier Vueling as an indication of where Iberia is heading. Their concerns are adding new members to a generation of <em>indignados</em> alarmed by an economic slump that has left one in four adults on the on the dole. Trade unions are determined to fight the plans.</p> <p>\"This isn't a plan to fix Iberia but dismantle it,\" said Manuel Atienza, who has been a flight attendant for 40 years and is a spokesman for the UGT union federation. \"If anyone thinks we are scared and resigned, they are very much mistaken.\" The Spanish pilots' union, Sepla, has long had a reputation for industrial muscle and a gathering of 1,000 of its Iberia members voted last week to reject the redundancies and demand a demerger of BA and Iberia.</p> <p>Maria L\u00f3pez, who has worked as an Iberia flight attendant with Iberia for 35 years, complained that workers were suffering the consequences of management decisions and circumstances beyond their control. \"The mood is one of deep sadness, as well as anger and indignation,\" she said. \"We understand that many airlines are running at a loss in the current economic situation and have loss-making routes, but I don't think this is the way to solve it. There is a lot of shared responsibility and it doesn't make sense to go after the weakest \u2013 and 4,500 is a lot of people.\"</p> <p>While Iberia staff are counting the cost in terms of thousands of colleagues, for shareholders it could be in the millions of pounds. A footnote in IAG's first-half results, published in the summer, refers to an \"impairment review\" that could lead to a writedown of Iberia, whose goodwill and brand is valued at more than \u20ac500m on IAG's books. Defending the deal, IAG points to a strengthened combined balance sheet and says Iberia has gained from \u20ac101m in \"synergies\" since the merger.</p> <p>Antonio Sanchez, a retired Iberia economist, said the carrier's demise would have far-reaching economic repercussions in a country that depends on tourism for more than 10% of its economic output: \"It just isn't the same when you no longer have a flagship. St Louis, Missouri suffered terribly after the collapse of TWA, because there are a lot of secondary services linked with a flagship. Pilots' schools have to close, you have no bargaining power over routes.\"</p> <p>Attempts to restructure Iberia may not prove an easy fight, even for a man of Walsh's reputation for enjoying the battle. Employees will be looking with interest at developments at Heathrow, where BA's management are reluctantly moving to union recognition for the \"mixed fleet\" of cabin crew. The fact that this tranche of staff, established by BA in 2010 to undercut the pay and conditions traditionally enjoyed by its crew, has rapidly unionised suggests that not even eager young recruits are willing or able to sustain the flexible working demands their bosses want to impose.</p> <p>Stock market analysts are largely supporters of airline consolidation along the lines of IAG, Air France/KLM and the shopaholic Lufthansa, which has brought Swiss and Austrian Airlines under its wing in recent years. Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, said: \"There can be no doubt that the scale of the Spanish downturn was not part of the game plan when BA originally combined with Iberia.\"</p> <p>However, he added that Spain's economic troubles and Iberia's losses gave Walsh the opportunity to correct those problems quickly: \"The original logic of the combination continues to have merit: it combines BA's strength position on the mature North Atlantic market with Iberia's strong position in the fast growing South Atlantic market.\"</p> <p>Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Esp\u00edrito Santo, has warned that the market has underestimated the scale of the problems facing Iberia, but agrees that progress towards consolidation is inevitable. \"The strategic logic of consolidation is still there, as is the attractiveness of Iberia's Latin American network,\" said Khoo. Walsh himself puts it as starkly as ever: \"Consolidation is inevitable in our industry.\"</p> <p>Walsh remains bullish about the deal, telling the <em>Observer</em> this month that he had \"no regrets at linking up with Iberia \u2013 not at all\". But he is now seeking savings on a more significant scale, and warned: \"No airline can guarantee its survival. And the reality is that Iberia cannot continue in its present form.\"</p>",

While Fastjet has yet to secure the final paperwork for its transnational routes, it expects to be selling Kenyan and Ugandan destinations alongside its regional service within weeks, and ultimately aims to grow into a pan-African low-cost airline. Fastjet's chief executive, Ed Winter, a former director of easyJet under Haji-Ioannou, said: \"It takes a long time in Africa to work beyond the bureaucracy and the politics, but the vision is a network across Africa.\" The business has merged with Fly540, an airline that will gradually disappear as Fastjet grows, but gives it assets in Angola and Ghana as well as east Africa.

      "bodyText": "Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is odds-on favourite to get a promotion \u2013 and that's despite the Financial Times backing him to succeed Sir Mervyn King as boss. The Pink 'Un did the same favour for Neil Kinnock just before the 1992 election, but despite what counts as a second setback to Tucker's campaign, the white smoke is still expected to be billowing out of Threadneedle Street to announce his ascension around the time of next month's autumn statement. With that in mind, it may be worth staying awake longer than usual when tuning into this week's parliamentary commission on banking standards hearing, where Tucker will appear alongside King and the Bank's financial stability boffin, Andy Haldane. Tucker will hope for an easier ride than he got during his parliamentary grilling on the Libor crisis, although the odds suggest only a George Entwistle-style performance could fell him. Still, while he may be way out in front, the 54-year-old is not the only horse still running. Lord Turner, bouffant-haired chairman of the Financial Services Authority, is giving evidence to the same hearing three days before his rival, when he'll be hoping to impress interviewers more than he has the bookies. Paddy Power now makes him joint third favourite (from four runners). Troubled times at Homeserve Homeserve is one of those companies that sells insurance to cover the cost of emergency plumbers turning up at your home. The company has been dealing with an emergency call of its own this year, having seen its value slump by a quarter after being hit by one of those Financial Services Authority mis-selling investigations that seem obligatory within the sector. So the City will be looking forward to the group's interim results this week from boss Richard Harpin (who promises to be with you between 8am and 1pm, so expect him to arrive in time for tea). Shareholders will be hoping that Harpin turns up with the right parts to fix their woes, although some wonder if he might soon be leaving, particularly if he's more concerned with telling gags. The best of those has been selflessly sending schools a copy of his book: A Mind for Business: The Secrets of how Award-Winning Entrepreneur Richard Harpin Built a \u00a31bn Business \u2013 a tome rated by its one Amazon reviewer as the \"least useful business book\". That's an accolade equal to Harpin's Entrepreneur of the Year gong; useless business books are publishing's most competitive genre. Double dose of eurozone bust-ups This week promises not one crunch eurozone summit, but two \u2013 a brace of events that may yet rival our own election double-header last week (for police commissioners and a new Corby MP, if you recall) for raw excitement. First off will be a meeting between finance ministers and IMF boss Christine Lagarde, who returns from her Asian tour early to tell Brussels exactly how they should be sorting out the Greek economy. Lagarde reckons eurozone governments should absorb more of Greece's pain. Jean-Claude Juncker, the Eurogroup president, does not. \"You know, it's not over until the fat lady sings,\" Lagarde told a press conference in Manila \u2013 in a virtuoso display of how to deploy an English cliche alongside a plausibly deniable dig at Angela Merkel. Later in the week comes David Cameron's big chance to shine, by playing the role beloved by every Tory leader since Ted Heath and failing to get near the level of EU budget cuts that his backbenchers will applaud. Italian PM Mario Monti smirks: \"Using British understatement, I would say our positions have points that are not completely aligned,\" \u2013 a line that might not please Cameron. Just like Lagarde, it sounds rather like Monti's taking the Mickey.",

      "body": "<p>Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is odds-on favourite to get a promotion \u2013 and that's despite the <em>Financial Times</em> backing him to succeed Sir Mervyn King as boss.</p> <p>The Pink 'Un did the same favour for Neil Kinnock just before the 1992 election, but despite what counts as a&#xa0;second setback to Tucker's campaign,&#xa0;the white smoke is still expected to be billowing out of Threadneedle Street to announce his ascension around the time of next month's autumn statement.</p> <p>With that in mind, it may be worth staying awake longer than usual when tuning into this week's parliamentary commission on banking standards hearing, where Tucker will appear alongside King and the Bank's financial stability boffin, Andy Haldane. Tucker will hope for an easier ride than he got during his parliamentary grilling on the Libor crisis, although the odds suggest only a George Entwistle-style performance could fell him.</p> <p>Still, while he may be way out in front, the 54-year-old is not the only horse still running. Lord Turner, bouffant-haired chairman of the Financial Services Authority, is giving evidence to the same hearing three days before his rival, when he'll be hoping to impress interviewers more than he has the bookies. Paddy Power now makes him joint third favourite (from four runners).</p> <h2>Troubled times at Homeserve <br></h2> <p>Homeserve is one of those companies that sells insurance to cover the cost of emergency plumbers turning up at your home. The company has been dealing with an emergency call of its own this year, having seen its value slump by a quarter after being hit by one of those Financial Services Authority mis-selling investigations that seem obligatory within the sector.</p> <p>So the City will be looking forward to the group's interim results this week from boss Richard Harpin (who promises to be with you between 8am and 1pm, so expect him to arrive in time for tea).</p> <p>Shareholders will be hoping that Harpin turns up with the right parts to fix their woes, although some wonder if he might soon be leaving, particularly if he's more concerned with telling gags. The best of those has been selflessly sending schools a copy of his book: <em>A Mind for Business: The Secrets of how Award-Winning Entrepreneur Richard Harpin Built a \u00a31bn Business</em> \u2013 a tome rated by its one Amazon reviewer as the \"least useful business book\". That's an accolade equal to Harpin's Entrepreneur of the Year gong; useless business books are publishing's most competitive genre.</p> <h2>Double dose of eurozone bust-ups</h2> <p>This week promises not one crunch eurozone summit, but two \u2013 a brace of events that may yet rival our own election double-header last week (for police commissioners and a new Corby MP, if you recall) for raw excitement.</p> <p>First off will be a meeting between finance ministers and IMF boss Christine Lagarde, who returns from her Asian tour early to tell Brussels exactly how they should be sorting out the Greek economy.</p> <p>Lagarde reckons eurozone governments should absorb more of Greece's pain. Jean-Claude Juncker, the Eurogroup president, does not. \"You know, it's not over until the fat lady sings,\" Lagarde told a press conference in Manila \u2013 in a virtuoso display of how to deploy an English cliche alongside a plausibly deniable dig at Angela Merkel.</p> <p>Later in the week comes David Cameron's big chance to shine, by playing the role beloved by every Tory&#xa0;leader since Ted Heath and failing to get near the level of EU budget cuts that his backbenchers will applaud. Italian PM Mario Monti smirks: \"Using&#xa0;British understatement,&#xa0;I&#xa0;would say our positions have points that are not completely aligned,\" \u2013 a line that might not please Cameron. Just like Lagarde, it sounds rather like Monti's taking the Mickey.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For some time now our chancellor of the exchequer has come across to the public as a kind of cheeky chappie. Last week we heard, through the medium of his father-in-law, my old acquaintance Lord Howell (energy secretary in Margaret Thatcher's first government) that George Osborne believes \"the prime minister is not familiar with these [green] issues, does not understand them\". Then highly placed Conservative sources indicated that the chancellor was against the entire \"green agenda\" of a prime minister who once declared that he was leading \"the greenest government ever\". Perhaps both prime minister and chancellor should reflect on another colloquial meaning of \"green\" \u2013 as in \"inexperienced\" or \"not up to it\" \u2013 which latter phrase was once used by Labour prime minister Clement Attlee on being asked why he was firing a member of his cabinet. Nevertheless, as his economic strategy disintegrates in front of his, and our, eyes, one has to admire Osborne's insouciance. In hard times a sense of humour always helps, and in an article for the Times last week the chancellor demonstrated that he has certainly not lost his . I am not referring to the main point, which was picked up by the rest of the media. The subject of gay marriage does not come into my definition of economic policy; nor, as far as I know, is it normally a subject of interest to Treasury officials. What interested me were the chancellor's inferences of the significance of the US election result for politics in the UK. \"First,\" he said, \"the incumbent government was re-elected despite a historically weak economic recovery.\" So that's all right for the Conservatives in 2015, then. Is it? We shall see. There is a difference between a historically weak US recovery of 2% a year and the experience of the UK, where there has been virtually no recovery to speak of and, according to the latest assessment by the Bank of England, there will be nothing like a return to pre-recession levels in the near future. Indeed, the talk is now of a triple-dip recession, although, in common with the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, I regard the economy as in depression until output returns to that previous peak, which has, one fears, gone outside and may be some time. It all depends on the semantics: recession returns, or depression persists. Either way, it is an Atlantic Ocean away from growth at 2% a year. But the chancellor's humorous comparisons with the US do not stop there. Osborne believes that a key reason why Barack Obama won was that American voters still blamed the Republicans for the economic mess inherited by Obama, and, likewise, way ahead in 2015, British voters will still be blaming the last Labour government. With three years to go, and the brunt of the patently ill-conceived austerity programme still to come? I doubt it. Even now, slightly under half of voters blame the last government, and they have seen nothing yet. Osborne views \"our council tax freeze\" as a vote-winner. This is the chancellor of a government that talks of localism but squeezes central government grants to local authorities to the limits. The impact on local services will not just be on the poor: Osborne's austerity programme will almost certainly hit the shires and the prosperous suburbs. Now, the point about the austerity programme is not that it caused the crisis but that it aborted the recovery, and continues to inhibit it. We experienced something close to a laboratory experiment in this country when, after the financial crash, the previous government lowered VAT and precipitated a recovery. That recovery was stopped in its tracks by the premature restoration of the earlier VAT rate, and the announcement of the austerity programme. At the time Osborne's sense of humour extended to such sick jokes as to compare our situation to that of Greece. At the same time, we were told that the Bank of England, via monetary policy, would counteract the effect of the fiscal squeeze. Well, there is a limit to which interest rates can fall, and it does not help that banks have gone from one (pre-crisis) extreme to the other when it comes to the granting of credit. As Lord Skidelsky demonstrated in his recent GLS Shackle Biennial Memorial Lecture in Cambridge, the success of quantitative easing has been decidedly limited, probably more so here than in the US. And last week Sir Mervyn King himself emphasised the limits of monetary policy. Of course, when the governor of the Bank said \"there are limits to the ability of domestic policy to stimulate private demand\", he did not add \"especially when the stance of fiscal policy is calculated to restrict that demand\". I sympathise with King's concern about the effect on our international competitiveness of the 8% rise in the average value of the pound in the past year \u2013 a significant partial erosion of the earlier devaluation. But no doubt the credit ratings agencies will contribute to a reversal of this, since Moody's has indicated that the UK's triple-A rating will be threatened if the growth prospects worsen or the chancellor fails to stick to his deficit reduction timetable. The chances of both these things becoming reality are hardly slim.",
