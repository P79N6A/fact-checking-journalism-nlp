      "bodyText": "Householders have been warned that energy bills could rise by almost 50% over the next six years as EDF became the latest big six supplier to announce inflation-busting gas and electricity price increases. A new report from the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, also stokes the price row by claiming that ministers \"do not know\" whether power bills will be affordable in years to come, as multibillion pound infrastructure investment pushes up tariffs. The report says: \"The available projections suggest that increases in both energy and water bills will continue to outstrip inflation, on average, up to 2030.\" The warning came as EDF unveiled plans to raise prices by 3.9% from January with a proviso \u2013 described as blackmail by critics \u2013 that the increase would be more if green taxes were not lifted by the government. EDF is building the \u00a316bn Hinkley Point nuclear plant in Somerset, a government-underwritten project whose cost will eventually be passed to consumers. Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF in Britain, justified the rise and insisted his firm would be seen as a \"force for good\" for the UK in the long term. But the biggest shock on Tuesday came at the UK's annual energy industry conference, where Angela Knight, a former Tory MP and bank spokeswoman who is now chief executive for trade body Energy UK, revealed that new research from investment bank UBS predicted energy prices would rise by 46% in the years to 2020. This meant that prices have increased by 260% since 2004, according to UBS analysts who blamed a history of inadequate investment and social and environmental policies. UBS referred to an annual domestic bill of \u00a31,100 but many consumers are already paying \u00a31,500 which could mean a rise to well over \u00a32,000 by 2020. Knight said energy companies had made some mistakes but were being unfairly blamed for much wider issues. \"The industry has become a lightning conductor for the general concern about the cost of living. As a result we stand accused for things that we do, for things that we don't do, for things that we are responsible for and things that we are not \u2026 this is not an understood industry,\" she said. Knight argued that the UK still had the lowest gas price in the EU and among the lowest electricity costs. But she said the \"old trilemma\" of decarbonisation, energy security and affordability meant there was relentless upward pressure on prices. Guy Johnson, a director at RWE npower, a member of the big six, said he believed that energy security was more important than either affordability or decarbonisation. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, warned attendees at the conference that the latest round of bill rises \"have not been fully and openly justified.\" However, the NAO has put further pressure on the government to intervene with a damning report saying there is little understanding in government of the financial implications of its own policies to bring much needed investment into energy, water and telecoms. The NAO recommends the Treasury should publish the expected overall impact on consumer bills, to promote transparency and debate about new infrastructure. It also argues departments should consider the implications for consumer bills and their overall affordability before making policy commitments on infrastructure. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: \"Government and regulators do not know the overall impact of planned infrastructure on future consumer utility bills, or whether households, especially those on low incomes, will be able to afford to pay them. It seems critical to know 'how much is too much', based on reliable information.\" Davey also used the conference to renew his attack on Ed Miliband, describing the Labour leader's proposal to freeze energy prices as \"intellectually bankrupt\". The energy secretary said he remained convinced the government should not intervene in prices. \"This will have a huge detrimental impact on the investment we need to deliver secure energy supplies. And an investment squeeze would mean a huge black hole in Britain's energy security \u2013 risking blackouts and higher prices in the long run,\" Davey said. Commenting on EDF's warning on green levies, the director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, Andrew Warren, said: \"It is absolutely disgraceful that a company that is majority owned by another government should be seeking to blackmail the UK government into changing its established policy to require energy companies to help customers stop wasting money by wasting fuel. \"There has been no increase whatsoever in the levels of social obligations placed upon the big six this year. This concerted attack on the energy company obligation by the big six is predominantly a distraction technique to draw attention from the price gouging they are practicing.\" \u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 13 November 2013 to insert a quote from the report.",

      "bodyText": "Vodafone plans to wade into the UK pay-TV business, in a move that would further shake an industry reeling from BT's \u00a3900m swoop for the rights to Champions League football. The plan is high on the agenda, group chief executive Vittorio Colao said at the company's half-year financial results on Tuesday. \"We will offer unified, converged, multiscreen services in all countries. What that will look like in Britain I don't know yet,\" Colao said. \"We have a new chief executive of the UK starting and they will help develop the strategy \u2026 I will be doing a lot of thinking in the next few months about the impact of telecoms companies owning content.\" Vodafone has earmarked \u00a319bn to upgrade its networks over the next two years, \u00a37bn of which will come from the sale of its US business, Verizon. Promising \"perfect voice\" services with 50% fewer dropped calls and the best 4G mobile internet services in Europe, Vodafone said it will invest \u00a31.2bn in the UK, including \u00a3300m of Verizon cash. Its efforts will be focused on London, with \u00a3150m spent improving coverage in the capital. \"We really can make a difference in a way that our competitors cannot catch up on,\" said its finance director, Andy Halford. \"We want to create some blue sky between us and the rest.\" Verizon cash is also being used for a bumper shareholder payout and to reduce debt. Vodafone will use its stronger balance sheet to fund more acquisitions. Some of those are expected to be in the pay-TV arena. The announcement that Vodafone is considering offering what marketers call quad play \u2013 TV, landline, broadband and mobile services \u2013 in its home country marks a change in stance. The group had previously said it would avoid Britain's overcrowded subscription TV arena; TalkTalk, BT, Virgin Media and Sky are competing alongside internet film and TV subscription services such as Netflix and Apple's iTunes. Vodafone will not rush into an expansion of its British business, but Jeroen Hoencamp, who stepped up to run Vodafone's UK business on Monday, has the task of devising the strategy. This could involve acquiring another company or going into partnership with one. Colao said Vodafone had discussions with Liberty Global, which bought Virgin Media earlier this year, about sharing content and networks, although the talks did not result in a deal. Last month, Virgin extended its contract with EE, whose masts it uses for its Virgin Mobile virtual network. In Europe, where many former national telecoms companies held on to their mobile phone businesses, Vodafone is under pressure because wireless services are sold at knockdown prices to attract customers to fixed-line broadband. Orange owns the French national broadband network and a string of mobile businesses throughout Europe. In Germany, where T-Mobile is owned by Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone has moved into TV by acquiring cable company Kabel Deutschland. Britain differs because BT spun off its Cellnet mobile business as a separately listed entity which eventually became O2. However, fresh from the launch of its sports channels, BT is planning its virtual mobile network in partnership with EE next year. Investors are speculating that, despite plans to turn itself into a multimedia group, Vodafone could ultimately be sold off. America's AT&amp;T, which has no assets in Europe, is thought to be weighing up a bid for Vodafone or EE in Britain. \"There is every reason for AT&amp;T, or other candidates, to be interested,\" said Robin Bienenstock, an analyst at Bernstein Research. \"Speculation on Vodafone as a potential acquisition target will continue to support the stock.\". Vodafone is hoping to spend its way into a leading position to take full advantage of the predicted European recovery. However, its revenues are under pressure. Financial results for the six months to 30 September show service revenue \u2013 which includes calls, texts and data charges but excludes handsets \u2013 was down nearly 5% across the group, with southern Europe falling nearly 16%. \"We are seeing this as an opportunity to over-invest to prepare for economic recovery,\" said Colao. The moves Vodafone might make Sign a Partnership Vodafone could secure a network-sharing deal with BT or Virgin Media, leasing broadband lines in exchange for sharing its mobile network. But both companies have recently committed to EE. Acquire Liberty Global Liberty bought Virgin Media earlier this year and its shares rose sharply in August on speculation Vodafone might buy the European cable TV group. Acquire BSkyB Rupert Murdoch's satellite company is not up for sale but if BT were to win the lion's share of Premier League rights in 2015 it might be. Acquire TalkTalk The budget pay-TV operator has a growing tribe of 4 million customers and would be a smaller mouthful to swallow than Sky, but it does not own a fibre network. Sell to AT&amp;T The Texan telecoms behemoth is looking for trophy European assets and is thought to have Vodafone on its shopping list. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 November 2013.

      "bodyText": "Controversial pay day lender Wonga has shuffled its management to allow its co-founder and highest profile executive Errol Damelin to move to a part-time role. The other co-founder of the business Jonty Hurwitz \u2013 who is also an artist \u2013 is leaving the company. Wonga, which quotes APRs of 5,853%, has incurred the wrath of the archbishop of Canterbury, who wants to set up credit unions to compete it out of existence. Damelin and Hurwitz founded Wonga in 2008 with backing from a number of private equity firms. South Africa-born Damelin is moving from chief executive to part-time chairman, replacing Robin Klein, who provided seed capital for Wonga and has been in the chairman's seat for seven years. \"These changes will free up my time to focus on where Wonga should be heading in the next decade, as we continue to develop as an international digital finance business,\" said Damelin. The company insisted the changes were not a precursor to a stock market flotation but reflected the changes underway at Wonga. In October it bought the German payment firm BillPay, adding to deals in Spain, where it bought Credito Pocket. It also owns a stake in Nahar Credits Private. Niall Wass, hired from Betfair in 2012 to become chief operating officer, will become chief executive. According to his LinkedIn profile, Wass is based in Geneva, where Wonga has an address. He recently conducted a number of TV interviews to hit back against the idea that Wonga's customers were poor and vulnerable. In one with ITV News at 10 he challenged the Archbishop of Canterbury to use Wonga. \"What I am asking him and others to do \u2013 go use the service, see if you think it is fair and transparent. Take out \u00a330 for 10 days, pay it back after a week and then judge us by our customers,\" he said. Wonga has recently launched a feature film, entitled 12 Portraits, to try to bolster its public image by telling real stories about its customers.",

After the Czech national bank's move last week to weaken the country's crown currency, Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities has been considering whether it is right to think - as US Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke claimed in November 2002 - that a central bank always could and always should use every device it could imagine to prevent a situation where prices fall, conventionally labelled 'deflation'.</p> <p>Lewis was prompted to consider this, he says, after the Czech central bank (CNB) launched crown sales on the open market for the first time in over a decade last Thursday, to weaken the currency and help stem a slowdown in inflation.

Japan has already established a precedent that exchange rate depreciation is fine with the global community if it happens to occur as an unintended consequence of domestic monetary actions. The CNB could hardly find comfort in that, however, since its policy is treating the exchange rate as a target and has involved active intervention on the exchanges to achieve its goal. There is a closer parallel with Switzerland, though the Swiss franc had been appreciating rapidly against the currency of its major trading partner, the euro zone, when the Swiss National Bank decided in September 2011 to cap its rate against the euro at 1.20. The Czech koruna, by contrast, had been fairly stable against the euro for months prior to the CNB's decision. Further, there had been brighter news on the Czech economy, in confidence indices and PMI data, raising doubts in some quarters whether a yet more accommodative monetary policy was needed at all.<br>The CNB justified its policy of fx sales in terms of preventing long-term undershooting of its inflation target. Mr Tomsik, a CNB vice governor, expressed the thinking behind the CNB's move in revealing terms. 'We would be in deflation for a very long period, easily three quarters if not longer, because economic theory shows that it is difficult to crawl out of deflation once you get stuck in it.' It is worth noting that this central banker regards nine months as a 'very long time'. It seems that, for him and his fellow-thinkers, even one month when the consumer price index is lower than in the corresponding month of the previous year is reason for deep concern.</p> <p>Then, there is his appeal to 'economic theory'. To be sure, some textbooks lay it down as indubitable truth that deflation is hard to escape and, as they understand the deflation process, they may be right. But that is not to say that any period when prices happen to fall is to be labelled 'deflationary'. There has, perhaps, been too much focus on Japan's experience, without regard for the special influences affecting that country, in assessing the proper priorities of monetary policy. After all, the USA recorded eight successive months of negative annual CPI inflation in 2009 without identifiable harm.</p> <p>Mr Janacek, a more robust member of the CNB's board, declared prior to last week's policy meeting that he would rather tolerate a few months of moderate 'deflation' than risk shocking the economy with a radical fx policy. We may well suppose the most immediate effect of the fx depreciation will be a rise in Czech import prices and a squeeze on Czech domestic purchasers' spending power. Though consumer prices may not now fall, the CNB's policy risks pushing the Czech economy back into recession. To court that danger simply because US economists of Mr Bernanke's stamp have theoretical notions on how the economy works shows how central bankers are still in awe of old thinking. We shall be watching the Czech experiment closely for the broader implications it might have for monetary management in the advanced economies.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T16:52:28.336Z\">at 4.52pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52824804e4b0312d704c111d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:44:17.715Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK fuel poverty rises and wage growth slows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After this morning's news of a significant slowdown in UK inflation there were plenty of commentators quick off the mark in noting that at 2.2%, it is still three times the average pace of wage growth. Now comes a separate report suggesting wage growth fell in recent months and another claiming fuel poverty is up.</p> <p>Data from VocaLink, the company that processes the large number of payments for UK workers, underlines the pressure on earnings. It says that despite recent signs of improvement in the UK economy its latest Take Home Pay Index shows that wage growth has slowed.</p> <p>The monthly index shows that pay growth in FTSE 350 companies fell to 2.2% in the three months to the end of October from 2.4% in the three month to end September.</p> <p>Looking at pay sector by sector, it says: </p> <ul> <li>Services sector take home pay growth slowed slightly year-on-year in the three months to October \u2013 down to 2.5% from 2.7% in the three months to September</li> <li>Annual take home pay in the manufacturing sector fell by 0.7% in the three months to October, following several months of slowing growth</li> <li>However the public sector experienced annual take home pay growth at 0.1% for the first time since March 2013.</li> </ul> <p>David Yates, VocaLink's chief executive:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This month\u2019s Take Home Pay Index highlights that across multiple sectors wage growth remains sluggish. While inflation has remained steady for over a year, rising prices of essentials are putting pressure on households and recent increases in domestic gas and electricity bills mean household spending continues to be squeezed.</p> <p>With the pace of wage growth slowing, there may be concerns about the prospect of consumer spending worsening as retailers head toward the crucial Christmas sales period.</p> </blockquote> <p>A separate report from Legal &amp; General suggests 1 in 3 households say they will be in fuel poverty this winter, up 53% on the same period last year. That is based on the government\u2019s definition of paying 10% of income on gas and electricity.</p> <p>Its MoneyMood Survey adds:</p> <blockquote> <p>The number of homes across the UK who say they are \u201cIn fuel poverty now or will be in the next three months\u201d is 6.8 million, up 2.4 million on the equivalent figure for 2012 (4.4 million). This is significantly higher than the latest Government estimates of 3.2 million homes in fuel poverty, which is based on 2011 data.</p> <p>In many regions the number of households in fuel poverty is even higher.</p> <p>Two regions have almost 1 in 2 in fuel poverty \u2013 in the East Midlands 48% say they are in fuel poverty (up 152%). Similarly in the North East 48% of homes are in fuel poverty (up 140%).</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-94527bc2-b394-40fe-b72a-d417b613cb9f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/12/1384271052091/6bfc3eb1-a934-4cea-afbc-57924a5fd95c-460x242.png\" alt=\"Legal & General MoneyMood Survey \" width=\"460\" height=\"242\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Legal &amp; General MoneyMood Survey shows 1 in 3 households across the country say they will be in fuel poverty this winter.

Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over in Greece, word is coming through that ahead of this afternoon's meeting, visiting troika inspectors have been focusing on lifting the blanket ban on repossessions of properties in a bid to rejuvenate the market and as <strong>our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith</strong>, says it is a potentially explosive issue.</p> <p>She writes: </p> <blockquote> <p>No subject is quite as neuralgic as that of doing away with the blanket ban on repossessions of properties whose owners owe less than 200,000 euro. In a sign of the mounting tension around the issue, visiting troika inspectors insisted that the prohibition, which is to be in force until 31 December, was the focus of today's talks at the finance ministry. </p> <p>Indicatively, the talks were attended by the heads of Greek banks, the development minister Kostis Hadzidakis, the Justice minister Charalmbos Athanasiou and the finance minister Yannis Stournaras,&#xa0;all of whom are&#xa0;under immense pressure to lift the ban when it effectively ends at the end of the year. The vast majority of non-performing loans are believed to derive from mortgage payers defaulting on their debt with bankers classifying around 30% of borrowers as \"strategic defaulters\" who can pay but chose not to pay because of other debts they deem more expedient.</p> <p>The ban, passed by a previous socialist government, has in the main been blamed by bankers for the defaults. With lack of liquidity an ever more pressing issue in a market that became lifeless long ago,&#xa0;the troika is pressuring the government to allow banks to auction off homes in the hope it will rejuvenate the Greek property market - one of the first victims of the country's debt crisis. </p> <p>A development ministry official conceded that although the fragile coalition sees the issue as \"another red line\" - with at least ten MPs resolutely refusing to endorse such a measure in parliament -- the heat was now on for the government to \"make a decision by&#xa0;December 15.\" </p> <p>\"What we are trying to do is protect the poor, vulnerable groups who absolutely cannot lose their home,\" he said. \"There is enormous pressure for the issue to be settled by the middle of next month.\" </p> <p>According to Greece's central bank, first-home owners account for the majority of 100,000 plus mortgages in arrears with officials reporting a leap in numbers in recent months because of a three-year backlog in annual property taxes that property owners have had to pay as part of government efforts to boost revenue.</p> <p>Without a compromise analysts believe prime minister Antonis Samaras' increasingly frail coalition could fall. MPs have said repeatedly they will not allow foreclosures to pass with one saying publicly it will tip the country into civil war.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52823c84e4b0312d704c1117\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:09:34.407Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is early on in the trading day in the US and for now, the main stock market indices are little changed.

Although the City of London was focusing on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/inflation-fall-welcomed-by-government\">unexpectedly sharp fall in the UK's cost of living</a>, this was merely part of a general trend from Hungary to Portugal and from Italy to Germany. Deflation is already a reality for some of the troubled countries on the fringes of the eurozone area. Others are heading in that direction.</p> <p>For now, that list does not include Britain where the current inflation rate of 2.2% is still (just) above the government target and higher than the eurozone average, which is already 0.7% and likely to fall lower when new figures are out later this week.</p> <p>But the data from the Office for National Statistics is still significant in three material respects. First, it suggests that the cost of living is finally responding to a lack of spending power...</p> <p>The second point to note - as Labour did - is that the gap between price increases and wage increases remains even after the fall in inflation from 2.7% to 2.2%, because average earnings are growing by less than 1% a year...</p> <p>Finally, falling inflation provides a breathing space for the Bank of England.

Sticking with the much <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/inflation-fall-welcomed-by-government\">weaker-than-expected inflation data</a> from the UK, a quick look now at how it is affecting the pound today.</p> <p>Sterling hit a two-month low against the dollar of $1.585 in the wake of the official data this morning as traders were forced to scale back their bets that the Bank of England would have to raise interest rates sooner than it had vowed. There is plenty more news in the pipeline for foreign exchange traders to bet on.</p> <p>Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inflation is now sitting closer to [Bank of England governor Mark] Carney's target of 2%, which will perhaps help ease market expectations for an early rate hike from the Bank of England. We'll hear from Carney and the bank tomorrow \u2013 it's an important 24 hours for the pound.</p> </blockquote> <p>For now, the pound stands at $1.5914, having recovered some ground against the dollar since the inflation number. </p> <p>Tomorrow morning sees the latest l<strong>abour market data for the UK at 9.30am</strong>. Once a story of primarily human and political importance, the figures have recently been catapulted into the economic indicator major league. Newly arrived Bank of England governor Mark Carney's forward guidance introduced in August uses a threshold of 7% unemployment, before which poliycmakers say they will not consider raising interest rates (barring various knockouts being triggered - lots more detail on that from the Bank <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx\">here</a>). Unemployment was at 7.7% in <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/october-2013/index.html\">last month's release</a> and economists forecast it to hold there in tomorrow's data. </p> <p>And just an hour after that we get Carney's second <strong>inflation report</strong> at the Bank. The quarterly release contains the Bank's outlook for inflation and growth and is accompanied with a 10.30am press conference. The markets have been quite clearly in disagreement with Carney's forward guidance, choosing to ignore reassurances of how long rates will stay low. It will be interesting to see if the Canadian can convince them to take forward guidance at its word with this latest appearance.</p> <p>Brian Hilliard, economist at Societe Generale in London expects the Bank to \"forcefully rebuff calls for early rate increases.\"</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The central focus of the market will be on the unemployment rate forecasts. It seems very likely that the MPC will predict that the unemployment rate will reach the 7% threshold towards the end of the three year forecast period. If it does so, it will go to great lengths to reiterate that it will only use that as an occasion to reassess the state of the economy. Especially, if it does not make material increases to the inflation forecasts, it will feel able to resist the pressure for early rate increases.</p> <p>Note also recent developments in other markets. The ECB has just cut rates as it is fearful of inflation falling far below target. That indicates a downside growth risk in the euro area, the UK\u2019s largest export market. The Bank will reiterate what that risk means for the UK. Moreover, there are increasing hints from the Fed that, even once it has started and finished its tapering, it will hold rates unchanged for much longer than previously thought. This is not an international environment that is signalling rate increases.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52822adfe4b0312d704c1114\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T13:22:54.093Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Our inflation poll</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to UK inflation -- do you think today's drop in the rising cost of living, to 2.2% year-on-year, is sustainable or just temporary?

      "bodyText": "It is a busy day for economic data in the UK on Wednesday. Here is a quick look at what lies ahead: At 9.30am, Office for National Statistics data on the labour market is expected to show the unemployment rate held at 7.7% in in July to September while average earnings growth edged up to 0.9% from 0.8%, according to a Reuters poll of economists. As mentioned before, the Bank of England has given a 7% unemployment threshold before which it will not consider hiking interest rates - barring various \"knockouts\" being triggered. At 10.30am, the Bank of England publishes its quarterly inflation report. More on that from earlier today. They will no doubt be more news on the effects of state-backed housing market schemes Funding for Lending and Help to Buy in a trading statement out early from housebuilder Barratt Developments. The strength of consumer spending as retailers head into the key Christmas season will be under the spotlight when J Sainsbury, the supermarket, publishes half-year results. Eurozone industrial production is out at 10.00am UK time and Spain is the latest country to release inflation data at 8.00am. Before we go, a quick round-up of where things stand on stock markets: The FTSE 100 closed down just 1.6 points at 6,726.8. Germany's Dax is down 0.3% to 9,076.5 and in France the CAC40 is off 0.6% at 4,263.8. In the US, the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.3% at 1,767, the Dow Jones industrial average is off 0.3% at 15,729 and the Nasdaq is down 0.3% at 3,908. With that I am signing off for today. We will be back in the morning with rolling coverage of business and economic news. Thanks for reading and for all the comments. While the UK government welcomes a slowdown in inflation today, in the Czech Republic, central bankers have been worrying about deflation. After the Czech national bank's move last week to weaken the country's crown currency, Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities has been considering whether it is right to think - as US Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke claimed in November 2002 - that a central bank always could and always should use every device it could imagine to prevent a situation where prices fall, conventionally labelled 'deflation'. Lewis was prompted to consider this, he says, after the Czech central bank (CNB) launched crown sales on the open market for the first time in over a decade last Thursday, to weaken the currency and help stem a slowdown in inflation. Reuters has the deails here. And thanks to business live reader londondavid for highlighting the move on the day. Lewis warns the central bank's policy risks pushing the Czech economy back into recession. \"To court that danger simply because US economists of Mr Bernanke's stamp have theoretical notions on how the economy works shows how central bankers are still in awe of old thinking,\" he says. He comments: CNB policymakers, or at least a majority of them, appear to have judged they could wait no longer in forestalling deflation risks and so decided to implement their fx plan. Deliberately devaluing one's currency is, of course, frowned upon in international circles. Japan has already established a precedent that exchange rate depreciation is fine with the global community if it happens to occur as an unintended consequence of domestic monetary actions. The CNB could hardly find comfort in that, however, since its policy is treating the exchange rate as a target and has involved active intervention on the exchanges to achieve its goal. There is a closer parallel with Switzerland, though the Swiss franc had been appreciating rapidly against the currency of its major trading partner, the euro zone, when the Swiss National Bank decided in September 2011 to cap its rate against the euro at 1.20. The Czech koruna, by contrast, had been fairly stable against the euro for months prior to the CNB's decision. Further, there had been brighter news on the Czech economy, in confidence indices and PMI data, raising doubts in some quarters whether a yet more accommodative monetary policy was needed at all. The CNB justified its policy of fx sales in terms of preventing long-term undershooting of its inflation target. Mr Tomsik, a CNB vice governor, expressed the thinking behind the CNB's move in revealing terms. 'We would be in deflation for a very long period, easily three quarters if not longer, because economic theory shows that it is difficult to crawl out of deflation once you get stuck in it.' It is worth noting that this central banker regards nine months as a 'very long time'. It seems that, for him and his fellow-thinkers, even one month when the consumer price index is lower than in the corresponding month of the previous year is reason for deep concern. Then, there is his appeal to 'economic theory'. To be sure, some textbooks lay it down as indubitable truth that deflation is hard to escape and, as they understand the deflation process, they may be right. But that is not to say that any period when prices happen to fall is to be labelled 'deflationary'. There has, perhaps, been too much focus on Japan's experience, without regard for the special influences affecting that country, in assessing the proper priorities of monetary policy. After all, the USA recorded eight successive months of negative annual CPI inflation in 2009 without identifiable harm. Mr Janacek, a more robust member of the CNB's board, declared prior to last week's policy meeting that he would rather tolerate a few months of moderate 'deflation' than risk shocking the economy with a radical fx policy. We may well suppose the most immediate effect of the fx depreciation will be a rise in Czech import prices and a squeeze on Czech domestic purchasers' spending power. Though consumer prices may not now fall, the CNB's policy risks pushing the Czech economy back into recession. To court that danger simply because US economists of Mr Bernanke's stamp have theoretical notions on how the economy works shows how central bankers are still in awe of old thinking. We shall be watching the Czech experiment closely for the broader implications it might have for monetary management in the advanced economies. After this morning's news of a significant slowdown in UK inflation there were plenty of commentators quick off the mark in noting that at 2.2%, it is still three times the average pace of wage growth. Now comes a separate report suggesting wage growth fell in recent months and another claiming fuel poverty is up. Data from VocaLink, the company that processes the large number of payments for UK workers, underlines the pressure on earnings. It says that despite recent signs of improvement in the UK economy its latest Take Home Pay Index shows that wage growth has slowed. The monthly index shows that pay growth in FTSE 350 companies fell to 2.2% in the three months to the end of October from 2.4% in the three month to end September. Looking at pay sector by sector, it says: Services sector take home pay growth slowed slightly year-on-year in the three months to October \u2013 down to 2.5% from 2.7% in the three months to September Annual take home pay in the manufacturing sector fell by 0.7% in the three months to October, following several months of slowing growth However the public sector experienced annual take home pay growth at 0.1% for the first time since March 2013. David Yates, VocaLink's chief executive: This month\u2019s Take Home Pay Index highlights that across multiple sectors wage growth remains sluggish. While inflation has remained steady for over a year, rising prices of essentials are putting pressure on households and recent increases in domestic gas and electricity bills mean household spending continues to be squeezed. With the pace of wage growth slowing, there may be concerns about the prospect of consumer spending worsening as retailers head toward the crucial Christmas sales period. A separate report from Legal &amp; General suggests 1 in 3 households say they will be in fuel poverty this winter, up 53% on the same period last year. That is based on the government\u2019s definition of paying 10% of income on gas and electricity. Its MoneyMood Survey adds: The number of homes across the UK who say they are \u201cIn fuel poverty now or will be in the next three months\u201d is 6.8 million, up 2.4 million on the equivalent figure for 2012 (4.4 million). This is significantly higher than the latest Government estimates of 3.2 million homes in fuel poverty, which is based on 2011 data. In many regions the number of households in fuel poverty is even higher. Two regions have almost 1 in 2 in fuel poverty \u2013 in the East Midlands 48% say they are in fuel poverty (up 152%). Similarly in the North East 48% of homes are in fuel poverty (up 140%). Over in Greece, word is coming through that ahead of this afternoon's meeting, visiting troika inspectors have been focusing on lifting the blanket ban on repossessions of properties in a bid to rejuvenate the market and as our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, says it is a potentially explosive issue. She writes: No subject is quite as neuralgic as that of doing away with the blanket ban on repossessions of properties whose owners owe less than 200,000 euro. In a sign of the mounting tension around the issue, visiting troika inspectors insisted that the prohibition, which is to be in force until 31 December, was the focus of today's talks at the finance ministry. Indicatively, the talks were attended by the heads of Greek banks, the development minister Kostis Hadzidakis, the Justice minister Charalmbos Athanasiou and the finance minister Yannis Stournaras, all of whom are under immense pressure to lift the ban when it effectively ends at the end of the year. The vast majority of non-performing loans are believed to derive from mortgage payers defaulting on their debt with bankers classifying around 30% of borrowers as \"strategic defaulters\" who can pay but chose not to pay because of other debts they deem more expedient. The ban, passed by a previous socialist government, has in the main been blamed by bankers for the defaults. With lack of liquidity an ever more pressing issue in a market that became lifeless long ago, the troika is pressuring the government to allow banks to auction off homes in the hope it will rejuvenate the Greek property market - one of the first victims of the country's debt crisis. A development ministry official conceded that although the fragile coalition sees the issue as \"another red line\" - with at least ten MPs resolutely refusing to endorse such a measure in parliament -- the heat was now on for the government to \"make a decision by December 15.\" \"What we are trying to do is protect the poor, vulnerable groups who absolutely cannot lose their home,\" he said. \"There is enormous pressure for the issue to be settled by the middle of next month.\" According to Greece's central bank, first-home owners account for the majority of 100,000 plus mortgages in arrears with officials reporting a leap in numbers in recent months because of a three-year backlog in annual property taxes that property owners have had to pay as part of government efforts to boost revenue. Without a compromise analysts believe prime minister Antonis Samaras' increasingly frail coalition could fall. MPs have said repeatedly they will not allow foreclosures to pass with one saying publicly it will tip the country into civil war. It is early on in the trading day in the US and for now, the main stock market indices are little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average had ended at another record high on Monday of 15,783.1. Here is how things stand: S&amp;P 500 -0.15% at 1,769 Dow Jones industrial average -0.04% at 15,777 Nasdaq -0.11% at 3,915 Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has been looking at the UK's inflation numbers and says the drop in the rate to 2.2% suggests the cost of living is finally responding to a lack of spending power. He writes: Inflation is in retreat across the west. Although the City of London was focusing on the unexpectedly sharp fall in the UK's cost of living, this was merely part of a general trend from Hungary to Portugal and from Italy to Germany. Deflation is already a reality for some of the troubled countries on the fringes of the eurozone area. Others are heading in that direction. For now, that list does not include Britain where the current inflation rate of 2.2% is still (just) above the government target and higher than the eurozone average, which is already 0.7% and likely to fall lower when new figures are out later this week. But the data from the Office for National Statistics is still significant in three material respects. First, it suggests that the cost of living is finally responding to a lack of spending power... The second point to note - as Labour did - is that the gap between price increases and wage increases remains even after the fall in inflation from 2.7% to 2.2%, because average earnings are growing by less than 1% a year... Finally, falling inflation provides a breathing space for the Bank of England. As Capital Economics notes, the economy is currently in a sweet spot in which price pressures are abating even though the economy is growing at an annual rate of around 3% a year. Read his full story here: Inflation fall shows effects of spending power squeeze In Germany, news is leaking out from the country's \"wisemen\" panel of economic advisers that they see the economy growing slightly faster than at the time of their spring forecasts. The panel now expects 2013 GDP growth of 0.4%, up from its March estimate of 0.3%, but still below the government's 0.5% forecast, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper (in German). Growth in 2014 is seen at 1.6%, again below the government forecast, which is 1.7%. The panel, officially known as the Sachverst\u00e4ndigenrat zur Begutachtung der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung - or German Council of Economic Experts - is due to hand its annual report to the government tomorrow. The Frankfurter Allgemeine says the report will contain \"harsh criticism\" of government policies and risks ahead to Europe's largest economy, centred on proposals to introduce a minimum wage, a change stipulated by the Social Democrats (SPD) in coalition building negotiations. Good afternoon. Sticking with the much weaker-than-expected inflation data from the UK, a quick look now at how it is affecting the pound today. Sterling hit a two-month low against the dollar of $1.585 in the wake of the official data this morning as traders were forced to scale back their bets that the Bank of England would have to raise interest rates sooner than it had vowed. There is plenty more news in the pipeline for foreign exchange traders to bet on. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex comments: Inflation is now sitting closer to [Bank of England governor Mark] Carney's target of 2%, which will perhaps help ease market expectations for an early rate hike from the Bank of England. We'll hear from Carney and the bank tomorrow \u2013 it's an important 24 hours for the pound. For now, the pound stands at $1.5914, having recovered some ground against the dollar since the inflation number. Tomorrow morning sees the latest labour market data for the UK at 9.30am. Once a story of primarily human and political importance, the figures have recently been catapulted into the economic indicator major league. Newly arrived Bank of England governor Mark Carney's forward guidance introduced in August uses a threshold of 7% unemployment, before which poliycmakers say they will not consider raising interest rates (barring various knockouts being triggered - lots more detail on that from the Bank here). Unemployment was at 7.7% in last month's release and economists forecast it to hold there in tomorrow's data. And just an hour after that we get Carney's second inflation report at the Bank. The quarterly release contains the Bank's outlook for inflation and growth and is accompanied with a 10.30am press conference. The markets have been quite clearly in disagreement with Carney's forward guidance, choosing to ignore reassurances of how long rates will stay low. It will be interesting to see if the Canadian can convince them to take forward guidance at its word with this latest appearance. Brian Hilliard, economist at Societe Generale in London expects the Bank to \"forcefully rebuff calls for early rate increases.\" The central focus of the market will be on the unemployment rate forecasts. It seems very likely that the MPC will predict that the unemployment rate will reach the 7% threshold towards the end of the three year forecast period. If it does so, it will go to great lengths to reiterate that it will only use that as an occasion to reassess the state of the economy. Especially, if it does not make material increases to the inflation forecasts, it will feel able to resist the pressure for early rate increases. Note also recent developments in other markets. The ECB has just cut rates as it is fearful of inflation falling far below target. That indicates a downside growth risk in the euro area, the UK\u2019s largest export market. The Bank will reiterate what that risk means for the UK. Moreover, there are increasing hints from the Fed that, even once it has started and finished its tapering, it will hold rates unchanged for much longer than previously thought. This is not an international environment that is signalling rate increases. Back to UK inflation -- do you think today's drop in the rising cost of living, to 2.2% year-on-year, is sustainable or just temporary? You can vote here in our new poll: UK inflation falls: is it just a blip? Economists expect energy bills to put pressure on inflation in the coming months The early voting suggests a majority of readers reckon inflation will be heading up again soon. And that's a good moment to hand over to my colleague Katie Allen.... Another photo from Greece, showing riot police detaining a fired cleaning worker protesting outside the finance ministry during today's meeting with troika officials: Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports that Greece's international lenders caused quite a commotion by accidentally hitting a motorcyclist with their car door today (see previous post for video footage) She writes: For the second time in less than a week, auditors representing Greece\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF have done what they hate most: making themselves the centre of attention by inadvertently causing waves outside the finance ministry. This time the incident occurred when a car carrying a technical team of visiting inspectors knocked a motorcyclist from his bike only meters away from the front door entrance to the finance ministry on Nikis street. In scenes captured on film by cameramen stationed almost permanently outside the building during auditors\u2019 visits, the helmeted motorcyclist is seen clearly being knocked to the ground when an inspector clips him as he tries to open the backdoor of the vehicle. The auditor sitting to his right gets out to see what has happened before the inspector who has opened the door, with some trepidation, also gets out to see if the cyclist is OK. The meeting to which the auditors were driving has since started but the Greek media is reporting that it still remains unclear whether the cyclist was injured. Regular readers will recall that last week visiting mission chiefs were the focus of protests outside the building when finance ministry cleaners, dismissed in a wave of troika-demanded firings, jeered and heckled inspectors more or less at the very same spot. IMF mission head Poul Thomsen was the target of one protestor last week who threw a barrage of coins at him as he got out of his car. The inspectors were forced to exit the building via an emergency back door entrance when protestors blocked elevators and the front door. Greek authorities have assigned extra police protector to the inspectors with prime minister Antonis Samaras attempting to placate passions by telling Greeks, in his first televised interview, that \u201cwe are not at war with the troika.\u201d Over in Greece, a troika official has knocked a motorcyclist off his bike as today's meeting between international lenders and the Greek government got off to a bad start. The unfortunate incident occurred as officials arrived for talks with finance minister Yannis Stournaras. As this video shows, an over-eager passenger in the Troika convoy opened his door as the moped drove past, sending it veering to a sudden halt. The good news is that the victim was reportedly uninjured. Kathimerini reports that there were \"disparaging remarks from a few dozen protesters gathered nearby\". Today's meeting is focused on Greece's fiscal gap for 2014 -- perhaps the Troika should focus on the gap between their convoy and the pavement. There's a longer video clip here on Keep Talking Greece, which also suggests the culprit should have been detained.... The crowd of protesters in Athens today included cleaning staff who are angry about the government's job cut programme - last week they invaded the finance ministry, forcing the troika to exit via the fire escape. Want to know more about UK inflation? The Guardian's datablog has all the stats, going back to the Attlee government: UK inflation since 1948 This won't ease fears that the eurozone is sliding into deflation - Portugal has reported that prices fell by 0.2% last month compared to October 2012. At -0.2% y/y, the Portuguese Consumer Prices Index was weaker then expected, driven by falling food and energy prices. It was flat month-on-month. Here's my colleague Katie Allen on the news that UK inflation has dropped to a 13-month low: Inflation has dropped to its lowest rate in more than a year, catching financial markets offguard and pushing back bets that interest rates in the UK will rise any time soon. The rise in the cost of living was just 2.2% in October, down from 2.7% the month before as measured on the consumer price index. That was well below City economists' forecasts for 2.5% and almost back at the Bank of England's government-set target of 2%. The fall was driven by cheaper fuel prices and less chunky rises in university tuition fees than this time last year, the Office for National Statistics said. But economists were quick to warn that with energy price hikes on the horizon and average wage growth at just a third of inflation, or 0.7%, consumers would continue to feel big strains on their budgets. More here: Fall in inflation to 2.2% welcomed by government Annalisa Piazza of Newedge Strategy sums up some other key points from the ONS's inflation report: Food prices fell a touch to 3.9% from 4.3% the prior month. As for other services prices, restaurants and hotels inflation rose two tenths to 2.8% in October, a sign that demand for services is actually increasing, leading to some upward pressures on prices. Today's drop in inflation is definitely good news for the Bank of England as risks for inflation in the near term have diminished. Piazza doesn't expect any major changes to the BoE's inflation forecasts tomorrow, when it releases new quarterly estimates. Recent announcement of increases in utilities prices will have to be factored in the the medium term forecasts. Falling inflation has been the story of the day - with German CPI hitting a three-year low of 1.2%, and Hungary's inflation rate dropping to its lowest rate since 1974. The Bond Vigilantes team at M&amp;G sums it up: Catherine McKinnell MP, Labour's Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, has welcomed the drop in inflation - before swiftly pointing out that wages are lagging (as flagged up at 10.21am). McKinnell said: This fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but with prices still rising much faster than wages the cost-of-living crisis under David Cameron continues. And with inflation-busting hikes in energy prices in the pipeline families and pensioners will carry on feeling the squeeze. Labour will act to help people struggling with the rising cost of living by freezing energy bills until 2017 and make work pay by expanding free childcare for working parents. And to help 24 million people on middle and low incomes we also want to introduce a lower 10p starting rate of tax. By opposing all these measures and giving a huge tax cut to people earning over \u00a3150,000, David Cameron has shown he's out of touch and only stands up for a privileged few. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), agrees that today's inflation data takes the pressure off the Bank of England, and helps firms and individuals. He warns, though, that recent energy tariff rises could push the headline cost of living rate up again. The larger than expected fall in inflation will ease pressures on businesses and consumers, particularly at a time when wages aren\u2019t rising at the same rate. However while we expect inflation to fall further over the next year, this will not be a smooth process. Some of the October declines are likely to be reversed, especially when energy price increases take effect. The UK has been more inflation-prone than other major economies. While latest figures show US inflation at 1.2% and eurozone at 0.7%, ours has been above the 2% target for more than four years. The MPC will see this fall as a sign that there is no short-term need to tighten monetary policy, even though the unemployment threshold is likely to be reached earlier than expected. However, the committee must focus on ensuring price stability to avoid threatening business confidence. The drop in the inflation rate takes some pressure off the Bank of England to consider an interest rate rise, says Rob Carnell of ING. He writes: Falling petrol and diesel prices seemed to have done the most to drag the inflation rate down, and the ongoing softness in Brent Crude prices means there may be a little more of this to come in the months ahead. There was also some price softness in furniture and household items too, though given the strength in the UK housing data is less likely to persist, though imported goods in this area might benefit to some extent from sterling's new found strength. Rising tuition fees mean that government adminstered price rises still add to the inflation total, and recent announcements of price hikes by the energy companies also suggests that this might not be the beginning of a new lower trend in UK inflation, though any dip is welcome, and will lessen the impacts of these looming prices hikes when they begin to come through in the months ahead. Speaking of energy prices, EDF has announced a 3.9% tariff rise -- which is lower than its rivals, but still beating average wage rises and the headline inflation rates. Lots of decent reaction to the news that UK inflation has dropped to a 13-month low. Here's Duncan Weldon, the TUC economist, to kick us off: Even at 2.2%, CPI inflation is still running three times faster than UK wages -- which rose 0.7% year-on-year according to the latest data. The squeeze on living standards continues. The Treasury has hailed the drop in Britain's inflation rate as a sign that the UK economy is on the right track. It even hinted that chancellor George Osborne should get some of the credit, having frozen fuel duty in March's budget. Here's the official statement from an HMT spokesperson: Inflation has fallen to well below half of its peak of 5.2 per cent. With the help of the ongoing freeze in fuel duty that has kept petrol prices 13 pence per litre lower than they otherwise would have been, petrol prices are now at their lowest level since July 2012. Britain\u2019s hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity. Thanks to the government\u2019s long term economic plan, all parts of the economy are growing, the deficit is falling and jobs are being created - and that's the only sustainable way to raise living standards for hardworking families. But times remain tough for many people so wherever possible we have found the money to freeze fuel duty, freeze council tax and take 2.7 million people out of tax by increasing the tax free personal allowance. The Office for National Statistics explains that transport prices fell by 1.5% between September and October, partly due to lower prices at the pump. The ONS reported: Petrol prices fell by 4.9 pence per litre between September and October this year compared with a fall of 0.9 pence per litre between the same two months a year ago, to stand at 131.6 pence. Diesel prices fell by 2.9 pence per litre between September and October this year compared with a fall of 0.6 pence per litre between the same two months a year ago, to stand at 139.0 pence. There were also notable downward contributions from air fares and prices for second hand cars. And education had less impact on the cost of living compared to a year ago, when tuition fees really jumped. Education costs jumped by 8.2% between September and October 2013,compared with a rise of 19.1% between the same two months in 2012. The ONS again: The downward contribution came principally from UK and EU student tuition fees, where the impact on the CPI of the rise in the cap for tuition fees introduced last year for new UK and EU students in England was smaller this year than in 2012. The smaller impact was due to the fact that many students were already paying the higher rate of fees. In addition there were more modest price increases for part-time and postgraduate fees compared to last year. This graph shows how last month's surprise drop in inflation brings the CPI measure closer to the Bank of England's target of 2%, matching the 13-month low of 2.2% hit in September. The full statement from the ONS on UK inflation is online here. On a monthly basis, the UK consumer prices index crept up by just 0.1% in October compared to September. The big drop in the annual rate of CPI to 2.2% matches the level recorded in September 2012 -- it hasn't been lower in four years..... The UK's Retail Prices Index, a broader measure of inflation used for some pay settlements and welfare calculations, also came in lower than expected. It was recorded at 2.6% year-on-year, down from 3.2% in September. The pound had tumbled over a cent against the US dollar, down 0.8% to $1.5857. It's also dropped to a one-week low against the euro, at \u20ac1.1866. Curiously, the pound was dropping in the seconds leading up to 9.30am - when the data was released. The core UK inflation rate, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, came in at 1.7% - the lowest rate since September 2009. The drop in UK inflation last month was mainly due to lower prices for motor fuel, air fares, second-hand cars and university tuition, according to the Office for National Statistics. Breaking: UK inflation has dropped to its lowest level since September 2012. The Consumer Prices index came in at just 2.2% in October, tumbling from 2.7% the previous month and much lower than economists had expected. More to follow! Back to eurozone inflation....and Austria's central bank governor, Ewald Nowotny, has warned that stagnation is the bigger threat. Reuters has the details: Stalling economy is a bigger risk to the euro zone than rapidly rising prices, European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Tuesday. The ECB cut its main refinancing rate to a record low of 0.25% on Thursday after October inflation came in at 0.7%, well below the central bank's target of below, but close to 2%. \"It's not the inflation that is the danger, it's stagnation that is the real danger,\" Nowotny said at an event organised by Pioneer Investments. Nowotny, who also heads the Austrian central bank, said that there is no north-south split at the Governing Council. Reuters reported on Thursday that about a quarter of policymakers, led by Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, opposed Thursday's interest rate cut. On Greece, Bloomberg flags up that finance minister Yannis Stournaras has two meetings today with officials from the International Monetary Fund, the ECB and the EC. The Kathimerini newspaper reports that the first meeting will include Bank of Greece officials, and will focus on plans to lift a ban on foreclosures (ie housing repossessions -- as NDMann kindly flags up in the comments). The second meeting will concentrate on Greece's budget shortfall in 2014. It was a cracking story while it lasted, but it appears that London's Walkie Scorchie tower will soon be fixed. The 'fryscraper', on Fenchurch Street, hit the headlines after locals spotted that its curved exterior was shining blinding rays of sunlight down to the pavement below, melting part of a Jaguar parked below. One intrepid reporter managed to fry an egg in the glare, while a local barber's reported that its doormat caught fire from the effects of the building (which was originally nicknamed the Walkie Talkie because of its shape). It's not a problem today, of course, with London gripped by autumnal gloom. But Land Securities says it's confident that a solution will be in place before the sun reappears sometime in 2014. It told shareholders this morning that: At 20 Fenchurch Street, our landmark tower in the City, we have continued to attract new tenants and the building is now 56% pre-let, with a further 20% in solicitors' hands. Despite the solar glare issue of the summer, occupiers have not been blinded* to the efficiency and location of the building. We are close to resolving the issue and it will not delay occupation nor inflate budgeted costs. * - we'll do the weak puns, thanks guys Inflation is also dropping in Hungary - where the consumer prices index dropped to just 0.9% year on year in October. That, according to Reuters, is the lowest level since 1974. It's a big fall on September's 1.4%, due to falling fuel and food prices (core inflation, which strips both costs out, was 3.4% year on year) At just 1.2% in October, Germany's annual inflation rate hasn't been lower since August 2010 when CPI was just 1.0%. Today's reading matches April's rate (so strictly speaking this is the joint lowest rate in three years). This chart shows the details: While our friends at fast FT also produced a nifty graph: (their take on the German inflation is here). New economic forecasts from the Bank of France this morning. It predicts that the French economy will grow by 0.4% in the final three months of 2013. We find out on Thursday how France performed in the third quarter of this year, when new eurozone GDP data is released. Economists reckon that French output rose by a mere 0.1% in Q3, a slowdown from the 0.5% recorded between April and June. With S&amp;P downgrading France last week, it could use a bounceback in the run-up to Christmas. This morning's UK inflation data is expected to show that energy prices dropped a little last month. A fall in petrol prices is one of the key factors behind expectations for the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) for October easing to around 2.5%, down from a rate of 2.7% in September. ... The ONS figures will show inflation staying stubbornly above its 2% target \u2013 and continuing to squeeze incomes as the cost of living rises. Inflation is expected to carry on falling from its 2.9% high in June. The rate was 2.4% in April. More here: UK inflation rate expected to fall in new CPI report Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Inflation is top of the agenda today, with new measures of the cost of living in both the UK and Germany being released. The German data is already out, confirming that its inflation rate has fallen to its lowest rate in three years. The cost of living rose by 1.2% in October on an annual basis, down from 1.4% in September, and the lowest level since August 2010. It fell by 0.2% month-on-month. Falling oil prices are one cause. In another sign that the eurozone economy is weak, wholesale prices in Germany were 2.7% lower than a year ago, dropping 1.0% month-on-month. It confirms that the European Central Bank was right to cut interest rates to a new record low last week -- a move that was not welcomed in Germany. Here's some instant reaction: We get Britain's inflation data at 9.30am GMT. It's also expected to drop, but not to Germanic levels. Analysts predict that the UK Consumer Prices Index will fall to 2.5% in October, from 2.7%. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it: While concerns about falling prices appear to be raising concerns in Europe, there is no such concern in the UK, with the latest October CPI numbers expected to show a year on year drop from 2.7% to 2.5%. The month on month figure is expected to show a rise of 0.4%, partly as a result of rising energy bills not being totally offset by a fall in petrol prices. Retail prices are still rising at 3% a year with a month on month rise of 0.5%. And with wages rising around 1% per year, a small fall in inflation will bring little relief to workers. Elsewhere....the Greek government will resume talks with its international lenders over its bailout programme. In the corporate world, Vodafone has announced details of a \u00a37bn investment programme after reporting a drop in revenues. Europe's weak economy gets the blame.... And it looks like a quiet start in the City. I'll be tracking all the developments through the day as usual.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is still facing potentially painful penalties from the US authorities over the sub-prime mortgage crisis, the Treasury select committee of MPs was warned on Tuesday. Already hit by a \u00a3390m fine for rigging Libor and in discussions with regulators over an investigation into potential currency rigging, the bank has been forced to hold more capital by the Bank of England because of the possibility of further fines, MPs were told by Robin Budenberg, the outgoing chairman of UK Financial Investments (UKFI). Budenberg, who was challenged about the influence the Treasury has over the body which was set up look after the stakes in the bailed out banks, said mortgage trading was one of the outstanding issues RBS faces. He made reference to JP Morgan, which has paid \u00a38bn to settle a number of regulators' claims it missold mortgages. \"We've asked them where they feel their exposures are and clearly there are a range of regulatory issues that are pending,\" Budenberg said. Earlier this month RBS admitted it was holding more capital and putting \u00a338bn of its most troublesome loans into an internal bad bank after a review commissioned by George Osborne ruled out a full-blown standalone bad bank. Budenberg admitted he had accelerated Stephen Hester's departure from RBS in September. The MPs were told that UKFI had not seen opportunities for a sale of the 81% government stake in RBS in the last two years \u2013 which appeared to contradict remarks by the bank a year ago when it raised the possibility of sale in 2014. Budenberg's successor, James Leigh-Pemberton, indicated that the average price at which the taxpayer bought its stake in RBS \u2013 502p \u2013 would not be the only consideration when deciding whether to sell any shares. \"It is difficult not to take it into account but it can't be the only consideration, because when we make our recommendations we also provide it in the context of whether there is an opportunity to realise fair value or more than fair value ,\" he said. Leigh-Pemberton said it was \"very, very difficult to say with any precision\" when a sale of RBS could begin, and it would not be before the \u00a31.5bn dividend access share, which allows the government to receive dividends before other shareholders, is removed. To demonstrate UKFI's independence from Osborne, Budenberg said he had resisted deep cuts to bonuses suggested by the chancellor on the grounds the reductions were not \"commercially acceptable\". Budenberg also cited UKFI's influence in convincing Osborne not to force RBS to sell off its US arm, Citizens, too quickly. Citizens is to be spun off next year, probably through a stock market flotation. \"Our view has always been that we need to give Citizens time to recover in terms of its financial performance, and now is a time to begin that process,\" said Budenberg. He is to leave at the end of the year after overseeing the sale of the first part of the stake in Lloyds \u2013 4.2bn shares worth \u00a33.2bn \u2013 in September at a price of 75p a share. Budenberg said the government could raise another 0.5p per share, or \u00a321m, if more short-term investors, such as hedge funds, had been allowed to participate in the sale. Budenberg said that UKFI wanted to show it was a responsible seller and that it does not \"just sell to the highest bidder\". Further details would be released by the National Audit Office, Budenberg said.",

The MPs were told that UKFI had not seen opportunities for a sale of the 81% government stake in RBS in the last two years \u2013 which appeared to contradict remarks by the bank a year ago when it raised the possibility of sale in 2014.</p> <p>Budenberg's successor, James Leigh-Pemberton, indicated that the average price at which the taxpayer bought its stake in RBS \u2013 502p \u2013 would not be the only consideration when deciding whether to sell any shares. \"It is difficult not to take it into account but it can't be the only consideration, because when we make our recommendations we also provide it in the context of whether there is an opportunity to realise fair value or more than fair value ,\" he said.</p> <p>Leigh-Pemberton said it was \"very, very difficult to say with any precision\" when a sale of RBS could begin, and it would not be before the \u00a31.5bn dividend access share, which allows the government to receive dividends before other shareholders, is removed.</p> <p>To demonstrate UKFI's independence from Osborne, Budenberg said he had resisted deep cuts to bonuses suggested by the chancellor on the grounds the reductions were not \"commercially acceptable\". Budenberg also cited UKFI's influence in convincing Osborne not to force RBS to sell off its US arm, Citizens, too quickly. Citizens is to be spun off next year, probably through a stock market flotation.</p> <p>\"Our view has always been that we need to give Citizens time to recover in terms of its financial performance, and now is a time to begin that process,\" said Budenberg.</p> <p>He is to leave at the end of the year after overseeing the sale of the first part of the stake in Lloyds \u2013 4.2bn shares worth \u00a33.2bn \u2013 in September at a price of 75p a share. Budenberg said the government could raise another 0.5p per share, or \u00a321m, if more short-term investors, such as hedge funds, had been allowed to participate in the sale.</p> <p>Budenberg said that UKFI wanted to show it was a responsible seller and that it does not \"just sell to the highest bidder\".</p> <p>Further details would be released by the National Audit Office, Budenberg said.</p>",

Noel said that the solar shading solution would be installed when the weather improved, and in time for when office workers move in next year in September. Land Securities is in a joint venture with Canary Wharf Group on the scheme, designed by the architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly.

The company announced that Sir Stuart Rose, the former chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, will step down as a non-executive director in January. At the same time Cressida Hogg, the managing partner of infrastructure at 3i, and Edward Bonham Carter, chief executive at Jupiter Fund Management, will join as non-executive directors.

SVG Investment Managers, which owns 2.6% of Andor, said:</p> <blockquote> We believe [Andor's] sales and margins are at a low point in the cycle, but prospects are likely to improve through 2014 as new products gain traction and markets recover through late 2014 and 2015. <br> We do not believe that Oxford Instruments' bid premium reflects the quality or long term earnings growth potential. There is a risk the company is sold at a price which could look like a bargain in the medium term.  We would expect additional interest in Andor from overseas trade buyers who see this as a very rare opportunity to acquire a business of this quality. </blockquote>",

But Ben Bourne at Liberum Capital was not worried by this: At first glance the bid looks expensive (23 times 2014 earnings per share) but management have a strong track record of creating value. Updated: Oxford Instruments said it believed its 500p cash offer was an attractive proposal to Andor shareholders and it looked forward to continuing discussions with the board. But one shareholder at least disagrees. SVG Investment Managers, which owns 2.6% of Andor, said: We believe [Andor's] sales and margins are at a low point in the cycle, but prospects are likely to improve through 2014 as new products gain traction and markets recover through late 2014 and 2015. We do not believe that Oxford Instruments' bid premium reflects the quality or long term earnings growth potential. There is a risk the company is sold at a price which could look like a bargain in the medium term. We would expect additional interest in Andor from overseas trade buyers who see this as a very rare opportunity to acquire a business of this quality.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation has dropped to its lowest rate in more than a year, catching financial markets offguard and scaling back bets that interest rates in the UK will rise any time soon. The rise in the cost of living was just 2.2% in October, down from 2.7% in September as measured on the consumer price index (CPI). That was well below City economists' forecasts for 2.5% and almost back at the Bank of England's government-set target of 2%. The fall was driven by cheaper fuel prices and less chunky rises in university tuition fees than this time last year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. However, economists were quick to warn that with energy price hikes on the horizon and average wage growth at just a third of inflation, or 0.7%, consumers would continue to suffer major strains on their budgets. The government was quick to welcome the news, while experts said the fall, together with a drop in the less volatile core measure of inflation to a four-year low, was good news for the UK's nascent recovery. \"The easing in the rate of inflation and underlying price pressures will provide greater scope for monetary policy to be kept looser for longer and thereby helping ensure a sustainable upturn in the economy,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at data specialists Markit. \"Lower inflation reduces the risk of the Bank of England having to hike rates earlier than it may otherwise prefer to, allowing policy to focus on stimulating growth rather than warding off rising inflationary pressures.\" The surprise drop in inflation pushed the pound down against other currencies, hitting a two-month low against the dollar at $1.585 with traders forced to scale back their bets that the Bank would have to raise interest rates sooner than it had pledged. Inflation was even lower than the Bank itself had been forecasting and policymakers are likely to change their outlook at their quarterly inflation report on Wednesday. . Economists said that while energy bill hikes could push inflation back up, it was unlikely inflationary pressures would force the BoE to abandon the path it has set out for low interest rates under recently introduced forward guidance. Under that scheme, policymakers said they will not consider raising interest rates from the record low of 0.5% until at least a threshold of 7% unemployment. Unemployment was 7.7% in the latest data. \"October's appreciable retreat in inflation will be welcomed by the Bank of England and it seemingly dilutes the risk that the knockout clauses to its forward guidance could be triggered,\" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, adding that the Bank is most likely to start raising interest rates \"in the latter months of 2015\". Experts said the Bank would also take reassurance from other measures of inflation that suggested so-called \"pipeline pressures\" from manufacturers' costs were easing as well as the less volatile cost of living indicators. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, eased to 1.7% from 2.2%, the slowest pace since 2009. Factory gate prices rose just 0.8%, also the slowest inflation for four years, according to separate ONS data released this morning. The inflation slowdown was welcomed by the Treasury, which is putting the final touches to its latest round of budget measures in early December's autumn statement. \"Inflation has fallen to well below half of its 5.2% peak. With the help of the ongoing freeze in fuel duty that has kept petrol prices 13p per litre lower than they otherwise would have been, petrol prices are now at their lowest level since July 2012,\" said the Treasury spokesperson. \"Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity.

      "body": "<p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> is among the fallers after analysts at Nomura repeated their reduce recommendation, albeit edging up their price target, and Goldman cut its rating.</p> <p>Nomura said investors needed to be patient to see a recovery at RBS - which has set up an internal good and bad bank - and there was potential for disappointment. Analyst Chintan Joshi said:</p> <blockquote> RBS's future value is driven by its core profitability. We extend our estimates to 2018, and expect group return on tangible equity to improve from around 6.5%-7% in 2015 to around 12.5% in 2018. Valuations based on 2018 estimates, when discounted to today, offer modest upside. However, a lot can change on such horizons, and valuations are very sensitive to assumptions. We do not see investors willing to look forward five years, and on a three-year outlook we still see material downside from current levels. <br> Looking through to 2016, we see core earnings per share excluding [US subsidiary] Citizens Financial Group at 34.2p, which puts RBS on a valuation of around 340p.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is among the fallers after analysts at Nomura repeated their reduce recommendation, albeit edging up their price target, and Goldman cut its rating. Nomura said investors needed to be patient to see a recovery at RBS - which has set up an internal good and bad bank - and there was potential for disappointment. Analyst Chintan Joshi said: RBS's future value is driven by its core profitability. We extend our estimates to 2018, and expect group return on tangible equity to improve from around 6.5%-7% in 2015 to around 12.5% in 2018. Valuations based on 2018 estimates, when discounted to today, offer modest upside. However, a lot can change on such horizons, and valuations are very sensitive to assumptions. We do not see investors willing to look forward five years, and on a three-year outlook we still see material downside from current levels. Looking through to 2016, we see core earnings per share excluding [US subsidiary] Citizens Financial Group at 34.2p, which puts RBS on a valuation of around 340p. We also expect dividends and excess capital per share of 12.4p and 31p, respectively. If we discount this to today, we see RBS's fair value at 285p. Litigation charges in excess of \u00a36bn by 2018, Citizens' sale below 1.1 times price to book value, restructuring charges not yet announced, and changes to macro sentiment create downside risk. We retain our reduce rating and prefer Barclays, which trades on similar valuations with better return on equity levels. With all that, Nomura has lifted its price target from 270p to 285p. At the same time, Goldman Sachs has moved from buy to neutral. In the market RBS has lost 7.2p to 332.6p. These new recommendations come just a day after analysts at Jefferies raised their price target on RBS from 390p to 441p, so it is safe to say there is a wide range of views on the bank in the City. Lower down the market, John Menzies has dropped 60.5p to 759p after it said poor trading in its distribution business would lead to lower than expected full year profits. Mike Murphy at Numis said: The third quarter statement confirms continued progress in the Aviation Services division but the Distribution operations were below expectations due to weaker than expected ancillary services.

      "bodyText": "EDF has become the latest energy company to raise prices for its customers, announcing an average price rise of 3.9% on its dual fuel tariffs and warning that more increases could come if the government does not cut fees for social and environmental work. The firm said that from 3 January customers would see bills rise by \u00a349 a year, to an average of \u00a31,300, but it claimed it was \"holding back rising costs\" from government schemes to limit price rises. The increase, which will also apply to customers taking just gas or electricity from EDF, is less than half those announced by rival firms including British Gas and Scottish Power, but is unlikely to be welcomed by the two-thirds of EDF's 5.8 million business and residential customers not on fixed tariffs. EDF said it had taken action ahead of the outcome of the government's review of the costs of the Eco scheme to help vulnerable households and other green schemes, designed to bring down costs for consumers. It said if the government made bigger changes to the costs of its social and environmental schemes than it had anticipated, it would pass those savings on to customers, but if the changes were smaller there could be further price rises. The firm said the extra \u00a349 on bills was made up of the following: \u2022 \u00a324 to meet a 9% rise in transmission and distribution costs \u2022 \u00a310 to meet smart-metering costs \u2022 \u00a36 to meet a 22% rise in the cost of meeting renewable obligations \u2022 \u00a31 to meet rising wholesale costs \u2022 \u00a38 to meet other rising costs including VAT, warm home discount, feed-in tariff The price rise includes the removal of a 70p-a-month discount for dual fuel customers.

Ofcom is so concerned about quality of service across the board, it has requested meetings in the coming weeks with all four UK operators to discuss their plans for improvement.

Miliband will make the announcement as he warns that British IT firms filling staff shortages from outside the EU, mainly the Indian subcontinent, will be required to take on a full-time British apprentice for each overseas recruit under a Labour government.

On a visit to Tech City in London, Miliband will say the number of IT and digital apprenticeships in the UK has declined by a quarter over the past year at the same time as recruitment of skilled workers from outside the EU in the sector has risen. Miliband will warn IT firms that he intends to make their industry a showcase for his call for more British apprenticeships, a subject he first pressed at the Labour conference in the autumn. \"We'll say to big firms who want to hire skilled workers from outside the EU, you can, but you will have to offer apprenticeships too so that we equip young people in this country and businesses with the skills that they need to succeed. \"We'll say to firms who want a government contract, you will have to have offer apprenticeships.\" Official government figures show that the number of people starting apprenticeships in information &amp; communication technology (ICT) fell by 26% last year. Over the same period, there were 7% more tier 2 high skilled migrant visa applications, increasing to 43,485, of which the largest single group were in the ICT sector (18,304). According to Home Office figures, 40% of tier 2 migration has been driven by demand within the ICT sector since 2010. Miliband will argue: \"IT and digital is now worth more than \u00a3100bn a year to the UK \u2013 and this figure could rise by half as much again over the next parliament, it is a key player in Britain winning the race to the top in which rising national income generates a prosperity shared by working families\" A recent report from research firm GfK, found that 77% of the businesses based in the Tech City area around Old Street in east London said the lack of skilled workers was restricting growth.

In India, Infosys has a large-scale training campus in Mysore, where currently 15,000 to 20,000 students attend a 23-week residential training programme each year. Michael Gove, the education secretary, described the existing school curriculum for ICT as harmful and dull. In the UK the demand for big data experts in large companies is expected to more than double by 2017 to 69,000, according to a study sponsored by data analytics specialists SAS. In 2013, there were 31,000 people employed as big data specialists at firms employing more than 100 staff, and the number is set to increase by an average of 49% each year, a survey carried out by sector skills council e-skills UK found.
