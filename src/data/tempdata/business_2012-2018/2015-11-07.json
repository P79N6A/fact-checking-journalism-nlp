      "bodyText": "When a stream of senior City women lined up outside 11 Downing Street last week the draw was not an audience with the man \u2013 George Osborne \u2013 whose official residence is behind the distinctive black door, but with a woman: Jayne-Anne Gadhia. The boss of Virgin Money, asked by the chancellor what could be done about the fact that fewer women get to the top in banking, fund management and insurance than in any other sector, was there to set out her bold views on gender balance. At the Downing Street soiree, Gadhia said companies should set their own gender-balance record, put senior individuals in charge of attaining the goals, and include the targets among those used to set bonuses. \u201cIn the City we are successful in delivering targets. Let\u2019s think about how that delivery has worked successfully in financial returns, customer satisfaction, environmental policy and see if we can apply it to gender progress and diversity,\u201d Gadhia said after the reception. \u201cThis is about women from the very beginning of their careers\u2026 This is about creating an environment where all women can become senior if that is want they want to do. I\u2019m trying to have a level playing field for everybody.\u201d The reasons she lists for the imbalance are well-known: motherhood, remuneration, the old boys\u2019 network. But she deliberately avoided suggesting an industry-wide target, such as the one set by Lord (Mervyn) Davies to encourage firms to get more women in boardrooms. \u201cQuotas and imposed targets could have all sorts of backlash,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say to organisations \u2018you have to have a customer satisfaction score of x\u2019.\u201d Requiring companies to publish their goals should be the way to hold them to account, she suggested. She did not believe any job in financial services should be out of the reach of women. Much could be done to break down stereotypes. Advisers on mergers and acquisitions, for instance \u2013 a line of business notorious for long hours of negotiations \u2013 could change working practices. One idea would be for advisers to work round the clock on one deal for three months and take a break before starting on the next one. \u201cIf we can just get that sort of thought going,\u201d she said. What about her own working hours? Gadhia said she didn\u2019t keep track. \u201cI live one life. When people ask me how many hours I work, I don\u2019t really know. Given the technology [available] today, I work all the time but I don\u2019t feel absent from home. Do I have a work-life balance? I have a life that feels balanced and full and I don\u2019t think any part of it feels underinvested-in.\u201d Gadhia said she encourages women to take the maximum amount of maternity leave time that they can. She took only six weeks, which in retrospect was \u201cstupid\u201d. \u201cI worry that because we want to make it the norm for women to work that it feels wrong to stay at home. It\u2019s about giving men and women choices.\u201d More thought also needs to be given to the transition back into work, she says, though she \u201cnever had that dislocation in coming back\u201d from maternity leave. Her husband Ashok, whose surname she uses, gave up his job when they had their daughter Amy after 19 years of marriage and six courses of IVF. He was also at Downing Street to support her efforts to promote gender balance. At the event, City women were lining up and taking selfies of themselves in No 11; Gadhia appeared as starstruck as anyone. That would surprise many. Once an outsider \u2013 not just as a women but as the boss of a so-called challenger bank \u2013 Gadhia has become part of the establishment. At the Mansion House dinner in June she sat next to Osborne as he outlined his settlement with the City after five years of banker-bashing. She has had her setbacks. She failed in her first attempt to buy Northern Rock when it was on the brink of collapse in 2008. She had a second try and won control of the sound part of the nationalised lender three years later for Virgin Money, backed by Sir Richard Branson, which has since floated on the stock market. She sold around a quarter of her stake for \u00a32m. She went to Virgin after leaving RBS (where her problem was not with Fred Goodwin - now stripped of his knighthood - but others) before the 2008 crash. Referring back to a previous giant financial scandal, Gadhia recalls feeling at the time \u201cthis is going to be the next Enron.\u201d A better gender balance might at least have helped in 2008, she feels. \u201cIf there had been more gender balance and diversity pre-crisis we would still have had a crisis, but I bet you it would have been less rocky, less bumpy and less painful.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Women\u2019s rights advocates say getting rid of tipping could help end rampant sexual harassment in the restaurant industry. According to a survey carried out by Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United last year, four in five women working in the US food service industry report having been sexually harassed by customers. About 74% of women in the restaurant industry reported sexual harassment from co-workers or superiors. Women who work in restaurants and bars should not have to tolerate lewd behavior and sexual harassment from customers in order to supplement their wage and make ends meet, said ROC co-founder and co-director Saru Jayaraman this week. \u201cWhen you live off the tips,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to tolerate whatever the customer might do to you, however they might touch you or treat you or talk to you, because the customer is always right. The customer pays your bills, not your employer.\u201d In a Thursday session in New York that kicked off a two-day discussion of ways in which employers and politicians could help reduce violence against women, Jayaraman laid out a case for how better wages could help reduce sexual harassment and assaults against women working some of the lowest-paid jobs in the country. Since 1996, the federal minimum wage for jobs where tips are received has been $2.13. Since Congress has shown little interest in reforming the tipped minimum wage, state and local governments have taken the matter into their own hands. About half of the 50 states have passed laws to increase the minimum wage for tipped workers. Seven have moved to eliminate it completely. The main opponent of raising or eliminating the tipped minimum wage is the National Restaurant Association, which Jayaraman and other advocates often call, in a pointed reference to the powerful gun rights lobby, \u201cthe other NRA\u201d. The NRA claims that most tipped workers are \u201cwealthy, white, steakhouse servers who make a ton of money in tips\u201d, said Jayaraman. In fact, she said, most tipped workers are women. \u201cThey are women who work at iHop and Applebee\u2019s and Olive Garden and suffer three times the poverty rates of the rest of the US workforce.\u201d Tipped employees\u2019 low wages and sexual harassment in the hospitality industry are intertwined issues, said Jayaraman. In states where tipped minimum wage remains below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and is anywhere from $2 to $5, women interviewed by ROC United were twice as likely to say they had been sexual harassed at work as women in states such as California, where the tipped minimum wage has been eliminated. Eliminating the tipped minimum wage and increasing the federal minimum wage could help reduce sexual harassment in certain industries, Jayaraman said. However, she added, the rise of \u201cbreastaurants\u201d like Tilted Kilt and Twin Peaks, in addition to the long-established Hooters chain, had reinforced the idea that women\u2019s bodies are on sale as much as the food. The NRA has dismissed ROC United\u2019s findings, saying they are part of recycled attacks funded by labor unions and their allies. Labor and women\u2019s rights advocates counter that low wages and sexual harassment are not separate issues for workers and thus should not be so for policymakers. \u201cIt is one spectrum,\u201d said Daffodil Altan, an investigative reporter and video producer at the Center for Investigative Reporting who attended the New York meeting. \u201cWorkers are not categorizing sexual violence over here and wage issues over here. It\u2019s just one continuum of work and exhaustion.\u201d Janitors are also at risk for sexual harassment and assault, the advocates said. Paid minimum wage and usually working the night shift, they are what Altan describes as invisible workers. In June, PBS aired a Frontline segment produced by Altan and titled Rape on the Night Shift, in which she interviewed women who worked as janitors and were allegedly raped by supervisors. \u201cThey show up and they inhabit all these buildings,\u201d Altan said. \u201cThey inhabit department stores, the Targets, the Walmarts. They are cleaning. And you can go to your office the next day and not know that a sexually violent crime has occurred there the night before.\u201d When Altan was a teenager, she said, her mom was a janitor who was harassed but not assaulted. Jayaraman said accepting such a culture in the hospitality industry could lead to women tolerating such behavior in other fields. She asked those attending to raise their hands if they had worked in the restaurant industry. \u201cLook around. It\u2019s everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cThe restaurant association estimates one in two have worked in the industry.\u201d To many women in these industries, sexual harassment and assaults have become part of the territory. When speaking recently at a university, Jayaraman said, she took a question from a female student who worked in restaurant. \u201cA young student raised her hand and said: \u2018I don\u2019t understand why you are talking about these things as if they are so outrageous. This is our industry.\u2019 And I said: \u2018It\u2019s outrageous that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s outrageous. It\u2019s outrageous that it\u2019s so normalized for you as it is in our industry.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s such a fine line between pleasing the customer, hospitality, the \u2018customer is always right\u2019, and doing things that feel totally uncomfortable.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The October job gains of 271,000 jobs caught off guard many economists and analysts who expected the US economy to add about 90,000 fewer jobs last month. The one person who was not surprised: the US secretary of labor, Tom Perez. In fact, Perez said the US economy could do much better if the Republicans would stop talking about defunding Planned Parenthood, pull it together and get on board with issues like infrastructure. \u201cOn average \u2013 in 2015 \u2013 we have seen growth of about 206,000 jobs which is very solid. I am heartened by this number,\u201d Perez told the Guardian on Friday. \u201cThe key is to figure everything we have to do to sustain the number because while we have made progress \u2013 the unemployment rate now is 5% as opposed to 7.2% two years ago \u2013 I think we can do even better.\u201d When asked what he thought of the Republican candidates\u2019 performance during the CNBC \u201cYour Money, Your Vote\u201d Republican Debate, Perez said Republicans need to address real issues. \u201cThe Republicans ignore pocketbook issues at their peril. The people I talk to across America \u2013 the main thing they are concerned about is middle-class security,\u201d Perez told the Guardian. \u201cThey have kids but they don\u2019t have paid family leave. They have been working for five years and they have not gotten a meaningful raise. They have a loved one who does not have access to health insurance. They want to have retirement security.\u201d While Democrats are talking about \u201creal issues\u201d facing \u201chardworking American families\u201d, \u201cRepublicans are busy talking about Planned Parenthood and scapegoating immigrants\u201d, said Perez. Weeks earlier, Carly Fiorina, a Republican presidential candidate and former chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard, accused Planned Parenthood of using taxpayers\u2019 money to harvest fetuses for profit. At the same time, Republicans in Congress attempted to defund the organization. All the while, one of Donald Trump\u2019s main campaign promises was that he would deport all undocumented immigrants if elected president in 2016. The GOP presidential candidates will have another chance to sound off on the economy this coming week when Fox Business and the Wall Street Journal hold their own debate for the Republican candidates. One of the topics that is bound to come up is Barack Obama\u2019s decision to reject the Keystone XL pipeline. The announcement came just hours after Friday\u2019s jobs report was released. \u201cIf Congress is serious about wanting to create jobs, this was not the way to do it,\u201d said Obama. His administration has a wishlist of sorts for job creation and a stronger economy that includes: a long-term infrastructure bill, reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and a comprehensive budget that would undo some of the cuts imposed by the 2013 sequester. If the last month is anything to go by, the wishlist could slowly become a reality \u2013 at least parts of it. On Thursday, the House passed a $300bn highway bill focused on improving US infrastructure like roads and bridges. If passed, the bill would also renew the Export-Import Bank. And on Monday, Obama signed off on a two-year budget agreement that passed through both the House and Senate in October. \u201cI am hopeful that we can get to the next level [of economic recovery] by having the Republican Congress finally deliver on some critical bipartisan items that should have passed years ago, such as the long-term infrastructure bill and the reauthorization of the Exim Bank,\u201d said Perez. \u201cThe progress we have made to date has been despite the Congress, and it\u2019s amazing how much we can do if the Republican Congress would actually work with us.\u201d",
