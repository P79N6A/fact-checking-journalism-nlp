The bookmaker's shares have risen by more than 60% in the past year. \"The board is delighted that Ralph will remain with the group for the coming years as we continue to manage the succession planning for the chief executive role,\" the firm said in a statement, adding that it is looking both internally and externally for a successor.",

OK, 88% is a lot better than last year's humiliating 46% but it still doesn't qualify as a Mugabe-style majority, which is the traditional definition of a \"good\" result for a FTSE 100 company. Look at William Hill. It had a walk-on role in last year's ill-named \"shareholder spring\" when 49% of votes were cast against its pay report. At Thursday's meeting, the bookie scored 97%. What's the problem at Aviva? One factor may be the continued presence of Scott Wheway as head of the pay committee. He cheerfully admits that \"in 2011 we clearly got it wrong\" but he doesn't appear to have paused to consider his own position. Given that he has been a member of Aviva's pay committee since December 2007 and its chairman since January 2009, he can hardly claim that he didn't have time to anticipate problems. In that period, remember, departed chief executive Andrew Moss was earning big bucks while delivering miserable returns for investors. Moss left with \u00a31.4m \u2013 a contractual minimum, apparently, which doesn't say much for the rigour of the writers of the contract. The other figure that leaps out of the pay report is the award of roughly \u00a3500,000 in shares to finance director Pat Regan from a 2010 incentive scheme that vested at 70% of the maximum. Yes, 70%. That's during a three-year period in which the share price was flat in a rising stockmarket and the dividend was cut. Boardroom rewards were clearly woefully out of step with Aviva's performance. We'll do better in future, promises Wheway, who has now armed himself with \"underpin metrics\" to promote closer alignment. Maybe it will work \u2013 but you can't blame the dissenting 12% of voters if they feel the pay committee itself requires underpinning in the form of a new chairman.",

    "webTitle": "Sch\u00e4uble urges calm on financial transaction tax after Cameron attack - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That's the lot for today. Here's a brief round-up of the main events, with links to the key points in the liveblog. \u2022 Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, moved to calm the row between the EU and the UK over plans for a eurozone financial transaction tax. Sch\u00e4uble told a high-level conference in London that the FTT could be years away, with many key decisions not taken yet (see 6.44pm). \u2022 Sch\u00e4uble's comments came after prime minister David Cameron attacked the plans for an FTT this morning. The British prime minister said they would hurt the EU as well as the City (see 10.23am), and drive business overseas. \u2022 And Boris Johnson banged the drum for UK exports. From selling cake to Paris to sending Piers Morgan to America (no need to thank us, US readers) (see 1.58pm for the whole tub-thumping performance) \u2022 In the currency markets, the yen fell through the \u00a5100 mark against the US dollar. (see 7.03pm onwards) \u2022 In the eurozone, there was fresh unemployment misery. The jobless rate in Portugal hit a new record high, while youth unemployment in Greece jumped over the 60% mark for the first time (see 11.23am) \u2022 In Spain, students and teachers held a general strike to oppose the government's plans to cut education spending. (see 4.37pm for photos) \u2022 And Spain's industrial production fell for the 19th month in a row (see 9.02pm) \u2022 But there were encouraging signs for the UK economy. Industrial production was stronger than expected (see 9.41am onwards) and independent forecasters at NIESR predicted that GDP rose by 0.8% in the last three months (see 3.18pm) \u2022 The Bank of England voted to leave interest rates and the UK quantitative easing programme unchanged (see 12.02pm onwards) Thanks for reading. We'll be back tomorrow. Goodnight! Kit Juckes, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's experienced currency expert, says today's yen selloff shows that the foreign exchange market can be 'bonkers' sometimes: Can't argue with his last point :) The Financial Times points out that the dollar has been ralling today since upbeat weekly jobs data was released, helping it into triple-figure territory against the yen. The US dollar broke through the Y100 against the Japanese yen for the first time in four years amid positive signs on the US economy, after jobless claims by Americans hit their lowest level in more than five years. The dollar index, which weighs the US currency against a basket of major counterparts, rose 0.4 per cent after figures showed that initial claims for unemployment benefits hit their lowest level last week since January 2008 This latest weakening of the yen against the dollar follows the concerted efforts by Tokyo to stimulate its economy through aggressive monetary easing. OK, 100 is just a number. But as the FT's currency correspondent, Alice Ross, points out (see previous post), it's also a 'resistance level', so the dollar could well push higher in coming days. The timing is also interesting -- with G7 finance ministers starting their two-day meeting on Friday. Insiders have suggested that we don't hear any dramatic talk about currency wars from the G7, but behind the scenes the foreign exchange issues will definitely be discussed. The Japanese yen just fell through the \u00a5100 to the dollar mark for the first time since April 2009. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble's comments on the financial transaction tax may be the most important line from this afternoon's panel session with Osborne, Lagarde and Flaherty at the global investment conference (highlights from 4.42pm) Reuters has the full quotes, and here's their story: Germany\u2019s finance minister said a controversial plan by 11 eurozone countries to introduce a financial transaction tax was not an urgent matter and it could take a long time to be finalised. \"We are just beginning this discussion. It is not a major concern to be very frank,\" Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said in response to a question about the planned tax at a conference.\"This year, next year...it\u2019s not (a) major problem,\" he said. The 11 countries who have signed up for the FTT could implement it from 2014. But Britain fears it will have a major impact on City firms, as a large slice of the total market for transactions conducted in euros takes place through London. Britain, of course, has launched a legal challenge to the plan. Sch\u00e4uble's suggestion that final agreement is a long way away does look like an attempt to cool the issue. Hours earlier, David Cameron had launched a full-blooded attack the plan. As I wrote this morning (see 10.23am), the UK PM told the global investment conference that: Unless it [the FTT] is introduced all across the world it is a mistake for Europe. Cameron added that Europe would not make the financial system fairer by simply forcing financial firms to relocate to Hong Kong, and pointed out that 40% of all EU financial services activity happens in the City. The student protests in Spain are continuing, with a march in Madrid tonight: The global investment conference in London finished with a plea to the cream of world business leaders to kindly not pinch the iPads they'd been loaned for today. The BBC's Fiona Bruce, who was hosting the event, wound it up by urging the audience: Don't take those event iPads with you. Apparently last year, 40% of them went missing. And that's the end of the session. An audience member asks what can be done about pensions costs. Should retirement ages be steadily raised, and raised, to lower future bills and make them easier to meet? Chrisine Lagarde replies: The issues of entitlement will haunt G7 members for a long time. She adde that it's essential to reduce the rate of at which entitlement programme costs are rising, so they are \"rebalanced relative to GDP\", and anchored into the medium and long term\". Flaherty point out that you need to give your populations fair warning if pensions ares are being changed. Schauble argues that the first priority is to battle youth unemployment, so build up a workforce who can pay the future bills. And Osborne points out that raising pension ages can have a dramatic impact on fiscal calculations. Flaherty also weight in on the Financial Transaction tax, pointing out that there is not wide support for it among the G20, as it is a \"tax on bank customers\", who did not directly cause the financial crisis. Sch\u00e4uble also told the audience that Europe must devise new measures to address the youth unemployment crisis. We must speed up on youth unemployment, or we will lose democratic support in some countries, he adds. (worth remembering that, for all Greece's 'remarkable progress', its youth unemployment level has now risen over 60% - see 11.23am) Interesting... Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble just suggested that the financial transaction tax should not be a 'major concern' in the coming months, saying it will be discussed at the G7 meeting. Sch\u00e4uble said there was a long way to go on the issue before final decisions are made. The future of the FTT was already looking uncertain following Britain's decision to launch a legal challenge. Is Europe losing its enthusiasm for the FTT, or just keen to kick it into the long grass for a bit? Curious.... Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble tells the audience that Europe has made impressive progress in recent months. The eurozone crisis wont be the main obstacle to growth in future, he declares, and points out that the total euro-area deficit has halved in the last three years. The lack of confidence has diminished. Sch\u00e4uble cites to the lower bond yields for Spain and Italy, and also hailed Greece's efforts, saying it has enjoyed \"remarkable\" progress in the last few months. Jim Flaherty, Canada's finance minister, says that governments need to balance their efforts to cut deficits in the medium term with the need to maintain economic growth. He argues that ministers must ensure \"medium-term fiscal responsibility\" in order to provide health and education services: If government's can't get sound fiscal policies in place, they can't get anything else right either. But at the same time, he adds, they can provide incentives to the economy, perhaps pro-trade programes or tax benefits to manufacturers, to keep growth in place. Flaherty adds: It's about striking the balance so that you have growth in the economy at a time when governments are moving in the right direction fiscally. And despite recent decent economic growth, Flaherty admits he is \"very cautious\" about the future. Christine Lagarde speaks next, repeating her recent warning that the world faces a \"three-speed recovery\", which could develop into a \"three-speed economy\" The iMF chief also points to protectionism as a priority, arguing countries could encourage economic growth by tackling this issue. Osborne also flagged up that the G7 meeting will consider monetary policy issues. That's Mark Carney, of course, who takes over at the Bank of England this summer... Osborne begins by telling the audience that the G7 finance ministers will be discussing ways to improve the performance of the world economy, when they meet in the UK on Friday and Saturday. He cites a new US-EU trade deal as a key issue, and adds: We'll also be talking about financial regulation, and some of the issue we face about regulating the global financial community. Osborne adds: The priority is to nurture the recovery and build on the stability seen in recent months. UK chancellor George Osborne, IMF chief Christine Lagarde, German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble and Jim Flaherty, the Canadian Minister of Finance, are holding a panel discussion now at the Global Investment conference in London NOW. The live stream is here. Students, teachers and parents in Spain have been holding a public education general strike against budget cuts today. Thousands marched in Barcelona, while some classes were disrupted as people protested against the government's cost-cutting reform plans in education, which are part of its multi-billion euro austerity measures. More details here. More Europe news - David Cameron faces a rebellion among his own MPs over his referendum plans. Our political editor, Patrick Wintour, reports that Conservative MPs are planning to engineer a vote on the issue by tabling an amendment to the Queen's Speech next week Patrick writes: The move has the support of hardline Eurosceptics such as John Redwood, Peter Bone, Edward Leigh and David Davis. It is normal practice for amendments to be tabled to the Queen's speech, but it is for the Speaker to decide whether to accept them. It is likely that the Speaker will accept this amendment, with a vote on Tuesday next week. It is very unlikely the amendment will be passed, but a sizeable show of Eurosceptic strength would be taken as a sign that David Cameron is struggling to control the mood on his backbenches. Worth watching Andrew Sparrow's ace Politics Live blog for more developments in the days ahead. Also, Boris Johnson has helpfully weighed in on the issue. He told reporters at the sidelines of the global investment summit that Britain must be prepared to \"walk away\" from the EU, if Cameron can't cut a better deal The Daily Telegraph's Louise Armitstead has the details: The Mayor of London said that he has \"always been narrowly in favour\" of Britain staying in the EU and \"particularly of protecting British interests in the single market\", but said there was also a \"real opportunity to get a better deal from Europe\". He backed David Cameron's efforts to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe. However, he added: \"It follows from our desire to have a renegotiation that we must also be prepared to say, OK, fair enough, we can't get the terms that are suitable, then we will walk away.\" Here's the Telegraph's full story: Britain must be ready to 'walk away' from EU, says Boris Johnson Back in the eurozone, and Ireland's international lenders have warned that the country needs to do more to stimulate employment. Following its latest mission to Ireland, the Troika reported that its bailout plan \"remains on track\". However, the labour market still has significant structural problems, it said. The Troika (the IMF/ECB/EU) also bluntly criticised Ireland's banks for not cleaning up their books faster. Here's the key lines from the Troika's statement: After a disappointingly slow start, banks are working towards meeting ambitious targets to ensure a durable reduction in mortgage arrears and the authorities will need to monitor this process closely. Further progress by banks in resolving unsustainable small and medium-sized enterprises debts is needed to help bolster job creation. While a pick-up in growth is needed to meaningfully reduce high unemployment, further policy efforts are important to address its increasingly structural nature. Further progress in enhancing engagement with the unemployed, including through the continued rollout of Intreo offices (which provide a single point of contact for all employment and income supports) and a redeployment of case workers, will ensure an even quality of activation and training services throughout the country. The significant progress Ireland has made in recovering lost competitiveness in recent years should be continued through opening up competition in sheltered sectors such as legal services. Concluding disposal of state assets can support job-creating investment projects. Just in: Britain's economic recovery picked up pace in the last three months, according to the latest estimate of UK GDP from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). NIESR has estimated that UK GDP increased by 0.8% in the February-April period. If accurate, that shows that growth accelerated last month (as GDP grew by 0.3% in January-March). That follows better-than-expected industrial production data this morning (see 9.41am). City analysts and traders are encouraged by the data -- and reckon it strengthens the government's hand as talks with the International Monetary Fund begin. The London Mayor ends his speech with a display of classic Boris, challenging \"mes amis\" in the audience to dispute that London is the best city in the world. Johnson stole the show by arguing that London offers a better quality of life. Here's the best bits: We have a crime rate that has been consistently falling, a murder rate one fifth of New York, we have more green space than any other European city, a fantastic banker-funded bike hire scheme, the cleanest greenest new bus in the whole of Europe which we are shortly to export around the world. We are planting tens of thosands of trees. We have more musems than Paris, and free museums at that. We have twice as many book stores in London than New York - no wonder we have a fifth of the murder rate. We have less rainfall than Rome -- I can't believe that statistic. We certainly have more theatres than either New York or Paris, and in a statistic I'm prepared personally to verify I'm told we have more Michelin-starred restaurants than Paris. We have the right timezone, the right language We are so faithful to the rule of law in this city that we lock up our MPs for trying to pass their speeding points to their wives. That is why people have faith in London. Boris's broad point is that London is a global cross roads of export: We export tea from the London borough of Sutton to China, we export bicycles made in Chiswick to Holland, cake to France, sand to Saudi Arabia. We've exported the British museum to Abu Dhabi. Gordon Ramsey to Doha. We've exported David Beckham - we don't just import footballers, we export them - to Paris Saint-Germain where I understand he's doing very well, and we have send Piers Morgan to America. That last 'export' got the biggest chortle. Indeed, Boris went on to argue that a new, four-runway airport in the London Estuary would revolutise the City, alongside other infrastructure developments. You can easily invision a new hub in East London, competing with Rotterdam and taking business back from Rotterdam, and entrenching London's position as the natural trading capital of Europe. Boris also touched on one of his favourite subjects, London's airport capacity. And he says Heathrow cannot be expanded. I don't think for a moment that expanding Heathrow is the answer. Johnson adds that one-third of all people in Europe who suffer from airport noise polution live around Heathrow. There must be a \"better solution\" he adds. The controversial Boris Island, perhaps? Boris Johnson, echoing David Cameron this morning, said it was important not to hurt the City, saying it provides \u00a363bn in tax for the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson is speaking at the Global Investment Conference in London, and urging business leaders to do more to create apprenticeship places. The London mayor says that 100,000 places have been created recently, but this needs to rise to 250,000 in the next four years. Johnson also touches on the issue of immigration, saying Britain needs a better visa system - and warning that it would be a mistake to block talented migrants. I don't believe we will be helping young people in this city if we close markets to talented people from overseas, any more than we'd help football if we closed it to Nani or [Robin] Van Persie. The Robin Hood campaign has criticised David Cameron for attacking the EU financial transaction tax and claiming it would drive bankers out of Europe (see 10.23am) In a statement, spokesman David Hillman said: By lashing out at the Financial Transaction Tax Cameron has once again proven he's batting for the interests of the Square Mile and not for the interests of Britain as a whole.\" It's disingenuous of Cameron to claim FTTs will cause bankers to flee when this is clearly not the case with the UK's own stamp duty on shares. It raises the Exchequer around \u00a33 billion a year and it makes no difference whether those trades take place in London, Hong Kong or Tokyo. Instead of repeating the lines of bank lobbyists the Government should give a proper justification for why they are refusing to tax the banks more and are cutting people's services instead. David Cameron's speech this morning was well received by the top business people in the audience, reports our economics correspondent Phillip Inman. Phillip writes: David Cameron's speech to the Global Investment conference went down well with delegates from City institutions after he praised the financial services industry and was happy to boast that London was a leading financial centre. Delegates chatting to me in the coffee break after the prime minister's speech said there was a distinct change in tone from the previous year's conference when the financial sector was barely mentioned. Cameron admitted that the banking industry was sent contradictory messages by the government when it was asked to both lend more and increase its reserves, but his only answer was to say that he hoped the new regulators - the financial conduct authority and prudential regulatory authority - will work something out with the banks, which was considered a disappointing response. Mark Gavin, European vice chairman of corporate and investment banking at JP Morgan supported Cameron's attack on EU plans for a financial transaction tax, though he only said it was a mistake to implement the tax \"in its current form\". Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, reckon's today's vote at the Bank of England may have been very close. For the past three months, the MPC has been split 6-3 on whether to hold QE or increase it. Archer suspects today's vote may have been 5-4, with Martin Weale joining the doves calling for an extra \u00a325bn of electronic money. Given his recent comments on more benign inflation developments resulting from lower oil and commodity price as well as ongoing low earnings growth, it is very possible that Martin Weale could have joined the three MPC members led by Mervyn King who have been voting for more QE since February. The Bank of England's announcement that UK interest rates remain at their current record low is here: Bank of England maintains Bank Rate at 0.5% and the size of the Asset Purchase Programme at \u00a3375 billion The Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged, and also voted to leave its quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn. There's no statement either. And there's little reaction in the City. If you missed David Cameron's speech, you can now rewind the live feed. A photo of David Cameron addressing the Global Investment Conference in London today: In the eurozone, Portuguese unemployment has hit a new record high, underlining the labour force crisis raging in the eurozone periphery. The total jobless rate hit 17.7% in the first three months of 2013, up from 16.9% in the last quarter of 2012. Portugal's youth jobless rate also jumped, to 42%. This is what David Cameron was referring to this morning, when he spoke of \"stratospheric\" levels of unemployment in parts of the Eurozone. Greece's youth unemployment also hit a new record high of 64% in February, data released this morning data showed. That's up from 59.6% in January, and the first time it's been over the 60% mark. David Cameron's line about the importance of tackling Britain's deficit at an \"sensible, measured pace\" (see 10.34am) have attracted some interest. The forecasts in March's Budget showed that Britain will make little progress on deficit reduction this year. Government borrowing is expected to be flat in 2013-24, at \u00a3120bn. Here's some early reaction to David Cameron's speech (see 10.11am onwards) from Twitter: Here's the key quotes from David Cameron's speech, in which he challenges those in his own party (such as Lord Lawson) who argue that Britain should leave the EU now. Some pessimists \"say there is no prospect of reforming the European Union, you simply have to leave. I think they are wrong.. I think it is possible to change and reform this organisation. It is in Britain's interest to remain a country that is uniquely well connected around the world. David Cameron went on to warn that the \"stratospheric levels of unemployment in countries like Spain\" are driving a debate about the future of the Europen Union. And he sticks to his position that Britain should renegotiate its relationship with the EU and then hold a referendum. First we must reform the European Union, then give Britain the choice if it wants to be part of it, Cameron argues. No word on if the PM is considering bringing the referendum forwards, following the success of the UK Independence Party in last week's local council elections. (Reuters has its own webfeed here) Cameron, who promised \"less of a speech, more of a download\"*, defends Britain's fiscal plans: We need to get deficit down. We are not doing it at an irresponsible pace. We\u2019re doing it at a sensible, measured pace. * - ironic, given the problems with the web feed. And he cited Britain's car industry as an example of where Britain's industrial policy is on track: David Cameron has attacked Europe for its plans to impose a Robin Hood tax on financial trading, claiming it would be dangerously counter productive. The PM was explaining the key reasons why firms should invest in the UK - and the first one he cited is the City. It's clear that this is an industry where we have a massive advantage...we should be proud of that. We shouldn't spend our time in politics bashing banks and financial institutions. Cameron then told the business leaders at the Global Investment Conference that the EU's plan for a Financial Transaction Tax -- a small levy on any euro-denominated trade -- was a blunder. Unless it is introduced all across the world it is a mistake for Europe. He argues that the City of London was essential to the UK, and valuable to the rest of the EU too - as it generated 40% of Europe's financial services. It is not just an industry that serves Britain, but serves Europe. Quite an attack on his fellow leaders from the PM -- but not a surprise, as Britain has already decided to launch legal action in the hope of blocking the plan. Cameron also argued that the UK's clear industrial policy was another reason to invest in Britain (and he could point to today's decent manufacturing data to back him him). The live stream appears to have crashed, incidentally, but we'll get you more highlights from the speech shortly.... David Cameron has started speech at the Global Investment Conference in London - there's a live stream here. The prime minister begins by explaining why the UK is a great place to invest, citing the country's open approach to businesss, great universities and a top-class legal system. He jokes that you can tell how fair a country's legal system is by how often it loses a court case: I'm proud to say that my government loses court cases all the time. I'll cover the key points of the speech... The Greek unemployment crisis is slightly less awful than feared. But still pretty terrrible. It's ELSTAT agency just reported that the jobless total was 27% in February. January's reading has been revised down, from 27.2% to 26.7%. That may encourage murmers that there is light at the end of the tunnel for Greece. But it's still a dire jobless total - a day after the International Labour Organisation warned that global youth unemployment is approaching the danger mark. Back in the eurozone, and Cyprus's central bank governor has told a press conference this morning that overseas depositors bore the brunt of the haircut imposed on Bank of Cyprus savers. Reuters has the details: Cyprus' central bank said on Thursday most of the depositors who lost money at bailed-out Bank of Cyprus were from overseas and that Cypriots had not been hit as hard as might have been expected. \"Seventy percent of the value of deposits concerned overseas residents, leaving Cypriot households and businesses unaffected to a greater extent than was possibly expected,\" Central Bank of Cyprus Governor Panicos Demetriades told a news conference. He said overall 96 percent of deposits in Cyprus were unaffected by losses on larger accounts required by the euro zone in exchange for aid to the overly indebted country. We shouldn't downplay the suffering in Cyprus, though. There was an excellent piece in the London Review of Books last week, with stories of people who lost most of their life savings. Here's a flavour: Panikos Demetriou had more than \u20ac100,000 in Laiki Bank \u2013 \u20ac178,000, to be precise. He has just \u20ac100,000 now. But even when the banks were working normally, even when the government hadn\u2019t yet come along and, as Demetriou put it, dipped into his pocket for \u20ac78,000 of his money, it wouldn\u2019t have been fair to call him rich. He lived, as he still lives, with his second wife in a small, comfortable apartment in a block on the outskirts of Larnaca, amid hundreds of other, similar modern blocks More here: The Depositor Haircut The pound has jumped almost half a cent against the US dollar on the back of the upbeat UK production numbers, to $1.558, as the prospect of further quantitative easing receded. UK industrial output beat expectations in March, rising by 0.7% month-on-month. The Office for National Statistics just reported that British factories increased production by more than expected during the month. That meant output was only 1.4% lower than a year ago. The rise was driven by a 2.4% rise in \"electricity, gas steam &amp; air conditioning\" - after the coldest March since 1962 boosted energy demand. But there was also good news on the manufacturing front, with a 1.1% month-on-month rise. The ONS added that the data is consistent with its estimate that the UK economy grew by 0.3% last quarter -- which may mean there's even less chance of the Bank of England easing monetary policy today. Here's some instant reaction: Industrial production in Spain has fallen for the 19th month in a row. But there may be signs of hope amid the ongoing economic decline. Output tumbled by an alarming 9.8% year-on-year in March, as the Spanish recession buffetted firms again. But, on a calendar-adjusted basis (making up for seasonal variations), the fall was just 0.6%. This graph shows how Spain's industrial sector has been generally weakening over the last two years. It's unusual to have such a big difference between the two figures: Here's Bloomberg's early take: Spanish industrial output declined less than economists expected in March, suggesting that the recession in the euro area\u2019s fourth-largest economy is abating. Production at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the number of working days fell 0.6 percent from a year earlier, after declining a revised 6.9 percent in February, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said in an e-mailed statement today. That\u2019s the smallest decline since Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy took office in 2011 and compares with economists\u2019 forecast for a 5.3 percent decline, according to six estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. But as Steve Collins, global head of Dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management points out, the unadjusted 9.8% drop in output is hardly encouraging: Also coming up today, a major conference on Global Investment in London is taking place today. IMF chief Christine Lagarde and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble are both attending, along with prime minister David Cameron and London mayor Boris Johnson. It starts at 9.30am. Dr Gerard Lyons, Johnson's economics advisor, says the event comes the eurozone remains the big concern for many: We'll get further news of the state of the eurozone this morning too, with jobs figures from Portugal and Greece, and the latest monthly report from the European Central Bank. Here's the agenda, via RanSquawk: \u2022 ECB Monthly report: 9am BST \u2022 UK industrial production: 9.30am BST \u2022 Greek unemployment data for February: Morning \u2022 Portuguese unemployment rate, for the first three months of 2013: 11am BST \u2022 Bank of England interest rate/QE decision: noon BST Some of data could be pretty grim, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets warns: Good news is likely to be pretty thin on the ground today from an economic data point of view. This is because Germany aside the economic data out this week from all over Europe has been nothing short of awful and today\u2019s is unlikely to be any better with the publication of the latest unemployment numbers from Greece and Portugal. While there are no estimates as to what the numbers could be, there is unlikely to be much improvement on the previous number of 27.2% for Greece and 16.9% for Portugal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone and the world economy. Central Banks are in the spotlight today, as the Bank of England's monetary policy committee votes on whether to give the strugging UK economy another pick-me-up by cutting interest or pumping more new money into the system through quantitative easing (QE). The MPC will probably sit on its hands, ignoring the pleas of outgoing governor Sir Mervyn King who has been pushing for more QE since February. But with several other central banks easing policy in recent days, a surprise can't be completely ruled out. We've already had one unexpected decision overnight -- the South Korean central bank trimmed interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. It blamed the \"sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area\", along with signs of \"weaker than initially anticipated\" growth in emerging markets such as China. It's the first cut since last October (the New York Times has a good report here) It's the latest in a swathe of central banks to ease policy, following the ECB a week ago, Australia on Tuesday and Poland on Wednesday. And given the weaknesses in the world economy, who can blame them? I\"ll be tracking all the developments through the day, as usual...",

Further progress by banks in resolving unsustainable small and medium-sized enterprises debts is needed to help bolster job creation.</p> <p>While a pick-up in growth is needed to meaningfully reduce high unemployment, further policy efforts are important to address its increasingly structural nature. Further progress in enhancing engagement with the unemployed, including through the continued rollout of Intreo offices (which provide a single point of contact for all employment and income supports) and a redeployment of case workers, will ensure an even quality of activation and training services throughout the country.</p> <p>The significant progress Ireland has made in recovering lost competitiveness in recent years should be continued through opening up competition in sheltered sectors such as legal services.

The initiative launched by the two organisations on Thursday in Kenya will see Save the Children with a seat on the R&amp;D board, advising on new products for the poorest countries, while GSK also pays for the training of more healthcare workers who will dispense medicines and give vaccines. Save the Children's chief executive Justin Forsyth, at the launch in Kenya with GSK's chief executive Sir Andrew Witty, described it as \"a ground breaking partnership\" which \"involves both organisations working in genuinely new ways to save the lives of a million children\". In the past, he acknowledged, Save the Children would not readily have jumped into bed with a drug company. \"Many years ago I used to campaign against GlaxoSmithKline and press them to lower Aids drugs prices, and we gave them quite a hard time, but GlaxoSmithKline has changed enormously and under Andrew's leadership is leading not just the pharmaceutical sector but actually the private sector in terms of setting a standard for how a company moves beyond just corporate responsibility and philanthropy to how its core business can be transformative in terms of children,\" he told the Guardian. The two organisations say this is a novel concept, however, which breaks the mould of wealthy corporation salvaging its conscience by handing over money to charity. GSK will be reformulating some of its existing products to help save babies' lives. An antiseptic used in GSK's Corsodyl mouthwash in Europe and America called chlorhexidine will be turned into a product which can be used to clean the stump of the umbilical cord of a newborn baby, which can prevent life-threatening infection. The company will speed up the development of a child-friendly soluble powder antibiotic against pneumonia, in dose-sized packs. They will explore possibilities for an alternative product where milk and safe water are not readily available. There will be training for new healthcare workers in the poorest communities who can vaccinate babies and give essential medicines to children and advice to families. The initial focus for the partnership will be two countries \u2013 Kenya, where GSK has a significant market, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it does not but has already been supporting Save the Children in training health and community workers. Forsyth said: \"I think the real big question we asked going into this partnership with wide open eyes was firstly how much of an impact it could have for children \u2013 and I think it's enormous \u2013 and secondly do we believe in each other's integrity and trust each other and I respect Andrew's leadership enormously.\" But \"we don't agree on everything\", he said and Save would still be willing to press GSK to lower its prices. Witty said it was \"the next step on the journey that we've been going on over the last five years or so where we keep on incrementally \u2013 and in this case it is quite a decent step up \u2013 increasing the level of commitment we are giving to this agenda. What we're doing differently here is we're really trying to align the full business model of GSK to an on-the-ground delivery partner.\" GSK had \"a whole portfolio of resources \u2013 mostly human, intellectual and research resources which we think can be lined up against some of the very specific needs which exist within child health within the developing world. \"It's a way to really shorten the timeline it takes the world to go from need to figuring out how to solve it, find someone who's prepared to do it, generate an answer and eventually get it deployed. It takes way too long.\" The partnership is to run for five years and is worth \u00a315m, \u00a31m of which will be raised by GSK employees. It is a modest investment relative to the multinational's sales of $44bn in 2011, which generated a net profit of nearly $9bn. Witty, since taking over at GSK, has made clear his determination to help developing world populations, for instance by reinvesting locally 20% of any profits made in poor countries. But some other aid organisations still consider GSK's concessions have not gone far enough. Rohit Malpani, director of policy and analysis at M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res' access to medicines campaign, said the success of the partnership would depend on GSK changing business practices that \"have undermined access to medicines across the developing world\". There are pressing question for GSK to answer, he said. \"Will they price their existing and pipeline HIV drugs affordably in all developing countries, or will developing countries be paying excessive prices? Will GSK grant MSF and other humanitarian organisations sustainable access to discounted prices already provided to GAVI so that we can vaccinate children against pneumoccocal disease?\" he asked. Mohga Kamal-Yanni, senior policy adviser at Oxfam, welcomed GSK's commitment to training more healthworkers, but questioned whether it would be sustainable. \"Who is going to pay them?\" she asked. \"The big problem for healthworkers is the lack of salary, especially in remote areas.\"",

      "bodyText": "Unions accuse Lloyds Banking Group of taking a tougher stance on job cuts by imposing compulsory redundancies on 689 staff in a major banking centre in Southend, Essex. The bailed-out bank insisted the latest job cuts \u2013 which one union put at more than 1,400 staff in total \u2013 were part of a previously announced plan to axe 15,000 roles by the end of next year, bringing the total to around 40,000 since Lloyds rescued HBOS in 2008. Officials at the Lloyds Trade Union (LTU) said the bank was changing its approach by pressing ahead with compulsory job cuts. Steve Tatlow, assistant general secretary at the independent LTU, said: \"There's a change in attitude \u2026 towards redundancies.\" The Unite union pointed out the return to profitability by the bank, which last week reported first quarter profits of \u00a32bn compared with a loss in the same period a year earlier. While the LTU has worked with the Lloyds management, led by Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, on other job counts, Tatlow isplanning to mount a campaign to stop the closure of the Southend centre. He denied it was a \"knee-jerk operation\". \"My trade union is opposing the bank's plans and is seeking to build a coalition of local interests from across the Southend community to pressurise Lloyds Banking Group into dropping its closure plans and to adopt alternative measures,\" he said. \"These could achieve the same ends without condemning such large numbers of staff to compulsory redundancy nor inflicting such damage on the Southend local economy and community.\" The LTU argued that Lloyds could have picked a different centre for closure and that compulsory redundancies could have been reduced. It calculated that of the 940 jobs being lost in Southend, only around 75 would be transfered to Chelmsford, 18 miles away, while 176 temporary workers would be dismissed and 689 staff made compulsorily redundant. Lloyds insisted 850 jobs were being cut but that 275 roles were being created. It insisted it was continuing to use \"natural turnover\" and redeployment, and pointed out that a third of the staff who left in 2012 did so under compulsory reduction programmes. \"Lloyds Banking Group is committed to working through these changes with employees in a careful and sensitive way. All affected employees have been briefed by their line manager today. The group's recognised unions Accord, Unite and the LTU were consulted prior to this announcement and will continue to be consulted,\" the bank said.",

He denied it was a \"knee-jerk operation\".</p> <p>\"My trade union is opposing the bank's plans and is seeking to build a coalition of local interests from across the Southend community to pressurise Lloyds Banking Group into dropping its closure plans and to adopt alternative measures,\" he said.</p> <p>\"These could achieve the same ends without condemning such large numbers of staff to compulsory redundancy nor inflicting such damage on the Southend local economy and community.\"</p> <p>The LTU argued that Lloyds could have picked a different centre for closure and that compulsory redundancies could have been reduced. It calculated that of the 940 jobs being lost in Southend, only around 75 would be transfered to Chelmsford, 18&#xa0;miles away, while 176 temporary workers would be dismissed and 689 staff made compulsorily redundant.</p> <p>Lloyds insisted 850 jobs were being cut but that 275 roles were being created. It insisted it was continuing to use \"natural turnover\" and redeployment, and pointed out that a third of the staff who left in 2012 did so under compulsory reduction programmes.</p> <p>\"Lloyds Banking Group is committed to working through these changes with employees in a careful and sensitive way. All affected employees have been briefed by their line manager today. The group's recognised unions Accord, Unite and the LTU were consulted prior to this announcement and will continue to be consulted,\" the bank said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hopes have faded that the Bank of England could unleash a fresh round of quantitative easing at their policy meeting on Thursday after news that industrial output increased by a healthier-than-expected 0.7% in March. The Office for National Statistics said the overall rise in production over the month was driven by a 1.1% rise in manufacturing output, and a 2.4% jump in electricity and gas production, as shivering householders turned up the heating during the coldest March since 1962. Over the quarter, industrial production was 0.2% higher than in the final three months of last year, helped by a 4% increase in mining and quarrying, as North Sea oil production ramped up again after a major shutdown for maintenance at the end of 2012. Lee Hopley, chief economist of manufacturers' group the EEF, said: \"Manufacturing looks to have had another good month in March with the data pointing to encouraging gains across the board, with almost all sectors posting some growth and on-going strength in transport and electrical equipment sectors. \"However, a smooth recovery path is not assured as uncertainties in the external demand environment are likely to stay with us in the coming months.\" Analysts said the quarterly growth rate of industrial production was in line with the ONS's 0.3% estimate for the rise in overall GDP over the first quarter, which was made before complete data for March was available. With the nine members of the Bank's monetary policy committee due to complete their monthly meeting at noon, the industrial production figures were seen as fresh evidence that the UK economy is on the mend. Some members, including Sir Mervyn King, have recently argued for an increase in the \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme, to help boost demand and kick-start recovery. However, City analysts said a new round of QE looked less likely after the positive industrial data. \"UK factories stepped up a gear in March, boosting production for a second successive month. With surveys indicating that growth gained further momentum at the start of the second quarter, the encouraging data reduce the likelihood of policymakers seeing any immediate need to add more stimulus to the economy,\" said Chris Williamson, of Markit. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, agreed. \"There are signs that UK economic activity may at last be gaining a firmer footing, although the economy is far from out of the woods,\" he said. However, the ONS pointed out that despite the upturn in March, overall industrial output was 1.4% lower than during the same month in 2012.",
