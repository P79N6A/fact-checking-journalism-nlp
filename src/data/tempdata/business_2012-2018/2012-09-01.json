We will know which trade-off he's plumped for by Friday, when Xstrata shareholders are due to vote on Glencore's plan to combine the pair into a \u00a353bn natural resources giant \u2013 although the latest opinion polls suggest the scheme is set for a comprehensive defeat.

Rising quiche but falling sales at Morrisons In one of his adverts for the supermarket chain Morrisons, England cricket hero Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff takes a bunch of young children on a shopping trip for a party. As they fill up the trolley with hearty favourites such as joints of British beef, hot cross buns and cupcakes, Freddie suddenly stops his group on the way to the checkout and asks: \"Did you get the quiche?\" It is hardly the worst gag you'll be subjected to in a supermarket commercial (that remains the most fiercely competitive field in the industry) but the supposed joke of a lad from Preston fancying such fare now seems to be on the retailer. The company unveils its interim results this week with City analysts expecting dire numbers, including falling like-for-like sales. Among the criticisms are the usual concerns about the chain's lack of online shopping and convenience stores, as well as the Bradford-based grocer suddenly appearing to have abandoned its core customer by trying to become too posh.

Making a marque They used to say that Range Rovers had heated rear windscreens to keep their owners' hands warm as they pushed them home, but the marque's reputation has been transformed since then. Nowadays Jaguar Land Rover, which makes the beasts, is lauded as that highly unusual case of a British manufacturing success story (albeit one that, rather less unusually, is foreign owned). The company has recently hired an extra 1,000 workers at its Halewood plant in Merseyside to launch a three-shift, 24-hour operation - as the carmaker attempts to satisfy demand for its new Range Rover Evoque, which is very popular despite a tie-up with Victoria Beckham. This week will also see the manufacturer unveil its latest line, \"the all new Range Rover\", a model made in Solihull and which the company boasts \"has delivered significant enhancements in performance and agility\".

      "body": "<p>In a warehouse by Manhattan's Hudson river next Wednesday, Nokia will fire up the most competitive Christmas mobile phone war yet.</p> <p>Observers say the devices it will unveil, produced in collaboration with Microsoft, could be a last roll of the dice for Nokia, which has yet to make a hit touchscreen phone and whose keyboard models are losing popularity. The stakes are also high for Microsoft, which will slowly fade unless it moves from desktop to handheld computers.</p> <p>Later on Wednesday, at New York's Gotham Hall, Motorola will beam the spotlight onto a new high definition handset in one of the biggest marketing events since the completion of its acquisition by Google.</p> <p>For some, these are just preludes to the main event. Apple is expected to unwrap the iPhone 5, its first major rethink of the gadget in two years, in California on 12 September.</p> <p>Capturing the imagination of consumers is crucial this year because the personal computing revolution is taking shape. Smartphones are replacing desktop computers as the easiest way of connecting to the internet. And to make those connections easier still, around the world, 4G networks with their superfast internet download speeds are being switched on.</p> <p>Both Nokia and Apple's new models are expected to be compatible with European 4G networks \u2013 the UK could have its first taste of these faster download speeds before Christmas on Orange and T-Mobile services.</p> <p>Apple will no doubt keep its biggest surprises under wraps until the launch. But according to leaks from the supply chain, the iPhone 5 or \"new iPhone\" as Apple may call it, will have a larger screen, a longer thinner body shape and hopefully a longer battery life.</p> <p>As Samsung, Apple and Google's patent warfare has demonstrated, the giants of the technology world are pouring unprecedented resources not only into developing and marketing new products, but into the expensive legal battles needed to protect them from imitation.</p> <p>\"Patent bullying is sweeping through the industry right now, but many are starting to realise it is the new normal,\" says Neil Mawston at research firm Strategy Analytics. \"Companies are competing in a very crowded market where any edge, be it via competitive means or via legal means, is prized.\"</p> <p>There are two battlegrounds.

      "bodyText": "In a warehouse by Manhattan's Hudson river next Wednesday, Nokia will fire up the most competitive Christmas mobile phone war yet. Observers say the devices it will unveil, produced in collaboration with Microsoft, could be a last roll of the dice for Nokia, which has yet to make a hit touchscreen phone and whose keyboard models are losing popularity. The stakes are also high for Microsoft, which will slowly fade unless it moves from desktop to handheld computers. Later on Wednesday, at New York's Gotham Hall, Motorola will beam the spotlight onto a new high definition handset in one of the biggest marketing events since the completion of its acquisition by Google. For some, these are just preludes to the main event. Apple is expected to unwrap the iPhone 5, its first major rethink of the gadget in two years, in California on 12 September. Capturing the imagination of consumers is crucial this year because the personal computing revolution is taking shape. Smartphones are replacing desktop computers as the easiest way of connecting to the internet. And to make those connections easier still, around the world, 4G networks with their superfast internet download speeds are being switched on. Both Nokia and Apple's new models are expected to be compatible with European 4G networks \u2013 the UK could have its first taste of these faster download speeds before Christmas on Orange and T-Mobile services. Apple will no doubt keep its biggest surprises under wraps until the launch. But according to leaks from the supply chain, the iPhone 5 or \"new iPhone\" as Apple may call it, will have a larger screen, a longer thinner body shape and hopefully a longer battery life. As Samsung, Apple and Google's patent warfare has demonstrated, the giants of the technology world are pouring unprecedented resources not only into developing and marketing new products, but into the expensive legal battles needed to protect them from imitation. \"Patent bullying is sweeping through the industry right now, but many are starting to realise it is the new normal,\" says Neil Mawston at research firm Strategy Analytics. \"Companies are competing in a very crowded market where any edge, be it via competitive means or via legal means, is prized.\" There are two battlegrounds. Some companies, such as Nokia, Samsung and HTC, specialise in making the hardware only. Others focus on software. Google has Android, which it licences for free to handset makers, including Samsung; and Microsoft licences Windows, for which it charges a fee. Apple straddles both camps by making and keeping both in house. While more smartphones are likely be sold this Christmas than before \u2013 research firm IDC forecasts a 32% increase to nearly 424m units in the last three months of this year compared with 2011 \u2013 few models are expected to reach the bestseller lists. Even if Nokia's new phones prove popular, on the hardware front the new iPhone and Samsung's flagship Galaxy SIII, on sale since late May, will almost certainly continue to dominate this year. In software, Android will remain the most popular choice. Analysts at market researcher Gartner are forecasting 392m Android units in 2012, compared with 143m iPhones.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Each nugget of data about the health of the American housing market or the mood of its consumers will be eagerly seized upon and carefully spun by Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in the coming weeks, as they fight to prove they should be trusted to run the world's largest economy. The US has shrugged off the after-effects of the sub-prime downturn more effectively than the eurozone, and is certainly in ruder health than the stagnating UK, expanding at an annual rate of 1.7% according to the latest numbers. Yet the background music for what promises to be a closely fought presidential campaign is of a country less certain than for many years of its place in the world \u2013 hamstrung by public and private debt; anxious about the disappearance of traditional jobs to low-cost markets overseas; worn down by a prolonged period in which living standards for middle America have moved sideways. If the latest analysis by the US economist Robert Gordon is correct, America's voters have every reason to be concerned \u2013 not just about whether the economy can weather the slowdown in China and Europe over the next 12 months, but about its growth prospects for decades to come. At the centre of his argument in a provocative new paper, \"Is US Economic Growth Over?\", is the insight that the latest wave of hi-tech innovation sweeping out from the US west coast may be less of a boon than its cheerleaders hope. As Silicon Valley twentysomethings waltz off with mega-billions, it's tempting to conclude that the internet has wrought the most radical transformation of the economy in modern history; and as Apple's big-bucks patent case against Samsung made clear, the corporate profits to be made and lost in what used to be called the \"new economy\" are immense. But Gordon warns that the growth dividend from the latest wave of innovations has actually been far smaller than that from what he calls the second industrial revolution, in the 19th century. In fact, he believes that the seemingly relentless expansion of the American economy could be about to run into the sand. Industrial revolution one, from about 1750 to 1830, brought steam and railways, Gordon argues; number two, from 1870 to 1900, gave us flushing toilets, electric light, the internal combustion engine and the telegraph, among a host of other benefits; and number three, from the 1970s onwards, computers. Gordon does not deny that there have been productivity gains from computers \u2013 serried ranks of secretaries in typing pools and filing cabinets full of punch-cards have been rendered obsolete; we can organise our lives with a barrage of text messages in the time it once took to pen a single note. And he acknowledges that productivity growth did improve, to 2.5% a year between 1996 and 2004, from 1.4% in the previous 15 years, as the benefits spread through companies and homes \u2013 but he argues that many of these were one-off changes, which cannot now be repeated. Instead of speeding up production lines and freeing workers for less menial tasks than typing or filing, he argues, today's major inventions are focused instead on ever more elaborate consumer gadgets. \"Attention in the past decade has focused not on labour-saving innovation, but rather on a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before, but now in smaller and more convenient packages.\" He asks his readers to carry out a thought experiment: would they rather keep 2002 electronic technology, but lose anything invented in the past decade; or keep the full package of post-2002 innovations, including Twitter, their MP3 player and their iPad \u2013 but give up running water and indoor toilets, just two of the key inventions that transformed the world in the late 19th century. In case you're wavering, he makes it clear that: \"You have to haul the water into your dwelling and carry out the waste. Even at 3am on a rainy night, your only toilet option is a wet and perhaps muddy walk to the outhouse.\" Surely, he insists, even the most hardened Twitter addict would choose a flushing loo over their smartphone. Not only has much of the gain from gadgetry already been banked, Gordon claims, but even if the productivity improvements that took place from 1987 to 2007 were maintained, the US economy will be hampered in the coming decades by powerful headwinds. These include the heavy weight of consumer debt accumulated in the runup to 2007, and the reversal of the demographic dividend that came as the postwar baby-boomer generation grew up, joined the workforce, and paid their taxes. Gordon estimates that once all these challenges are taken into account, GDP growth per capita could slow to just 0.2% a year. That's still economic progress, of a sort \u2013 but it does mean, as Gordon argues, that the 21st century, unlike the 20th, will not be an \"American century\"; and today's young Americans must confront a very different future to that of their parents. They will have to think harder about rationing scarce resources, and perhaps take a humbler stance in relation to their foreign rivals \u2013 something we Brits have become increasingly used to since our own dominance of the global economy gave way to US hegemony. Gordon cheekily points out that per capita growth of 0.2% a year is the same rate economists believe Britain achieved on average in the 600 years or so before the first industrial revolution, which are better remembered for feudalism, illiteracy and back-breaking toil than the onward march of economic progress. But as the star-spangled banner flutters behind a thousand presidential stump speeches between now and November, don't expect to hear too much about that.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bronwyn \u2013 proudly patting herself down and establishing that under her clothes and smart, hot-pink anorak it's just the \"bra and knickers\" that have been bought at her favourite store \u2013 says: \"I'm an M&amp;S lady.\" The 62-year-old retired social worker was one of hundreds of shoppers crowding the aisles of the new Marks &amp; Spencer superstore at Cheshire Oaks in Ellesmere Port when it opened last week. With a shop-floor area equivalent to the size of 11 Olympic swimming pools, the vast store \u2013 codenamed \"concept 11\" \u2013 is M&amp;S's best crack to date at merging the worlds of physical and online shopping. M&amp;S is trying to please loyal shoppers like Bronwyn who arrive at its stores armed with mobile phones in their handbags that have more computing power than the average PC of a decade ago. \"I'm one of the older generation \u2013 we get called silver surfers \u2013 who are switched on to modern technology,\" she explains. With the internet now part of the fabric of modern life, M&amp;S's digital guru Laura Wade-Gery, is firm: \"The high street is not going to stand still so we know that we can't.\" The executive, who was hired from Tesco last year, is behind the retailer's growing arsenal of interactive shopping technology. \"How do we use the internet to reinvent the store?\" she asks. \"It's as big a mission as that.\" In the Cheshire store, customers are invited to use \"browse and order\" hubs kitted out with giant touchscreens that look like they have been stolen from the Teletubbies. The latest clothing lines and home fashions are beamed from 70in \"inspirational\" displays, with additional backup provided by assistants prowling the shop floor armed with holstered iPads, ready to plug the gap between the thousands of products hanging on the rails and those out there in cyberspace. The striking store, which has a curvy wooden roof made of \"glulam\" (glued laminate) and hemp walls, might be M&amp;S's greenest to date, but in the six long years it has taken to come to fruition it has increasingly been argued that big stores are growing obsolete, as shoppers defect to the virtual high street. M&amp;S boss Marc Bolland admitted at the opening that if he could have turned back the clock, the monster store would have been \"a tad smaller\". At 151,000 sq ft it is unlikely M&amp;S will ever open such a large branch again. But with a catchment of 1.3 million people and \u00a34bn of local retail sales to go after, Bolland insisted it was not just a large store, but rather \"a shopping experience\". The shadow cast by the internet and now mobile shopping has spawned retail industry buzzwords such as \"multichannel\" and even \"omnichannel\", which attempt to describe how customers increasingly use both store and websites in tandem. Jargon aside, retailers find that the more channels their customers use, the more they spend. M&amp;S says shoppers who shop on its website as well in its stores spend four times as much; throw smartphones into the mix and they spend eight times as much. To that end Wade-Gery recites the Coca-Cola Company's famous goal to be \"within an arm's reach of desire\", which helped it conquer the soft drinks market in the 20th century: \"We have to provide more ways for consumers to access M&amp;S.\" The retailer is spending \u00a3150m to upgrade its website, because for all the technical jiggery-pokery and free Wi-Fi at Cheshire Oaks, antiquated systems mean it still takes up to five days for items ordered in store to arrive. With multichannel sales accelerating in the second half of the last financial year, Wade-Gery suggests she is already making an impact on the retailer. Andy Morrey, M&amp;S's first e-commerce director, who has since founded retail consultancy eNova, says the high street is responding to consumer behaviour, not the other way around: \"There is no point launching a service or app just for the sake of it,\" he explains. \"It won't work unless it addresses a consumer need.\" A McDonald's app is reported to have been little used \"because nobody needed an app to find a McDonald's\". In his subsequent job at Argos, Morrey masterminded the launch of \"click and collect\", a service now taken for granted by shoppers: \"Nobody else had done it and the industry was very sceptical about whether it would be a success.\" Multichannel retailing is still in its infancy, he adds, predicting that faster broadband speeds and 4G will trigger more change. Most of M&amp;S's shoppers are aged over 40, and some analysts argue the internet is less relevant to it than chains with a younger clientele. Wade-Gery, however, remembers a recent focus group in St Albans when a 75-year-old woman held forth on the merits of Groupon. \"You have to be really careful not to stereotype people,\" she says, adding that half of women aged 55 to 65 own a smartphone, while one in three has a tablet computer. The multichannel effect has certainly helped John Lewis, M&amp;S's arch-rival for the hearts of middle England's shoppers, during what has been a prolonged high street downturn. Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders says online sales will grow 13% this year, against a retail market that will shrink by about 1%. \"If you are not online you can't tap into these seams of growth,\" he says. Saunders thinks M&amp;S has more pressing concerns to address than getting its \"bricks and clicks\" act together. Last year its share of the womenswear market dropped from 10.9% to 10.4%, due to a combination of tough competition and buying mistakes that resulted in shortages of bestselling lines. \"M&amp;S is still the biggest but each year its lead is dwindling,\" he says. Back at the store, Carole, clutching outfits for her baby grandson that she says are a steal at \u00a38, nails the problem: \"My only complaint would be when I walk in the womenswear department and see the same style they have done for the last two years \u2013 it's just in a different colour.\" M&amp;S's new autumn fashion ads, which will be shown for the first time this week, aim to highlight the retailer's \"style credentials\". The ads will feature relatively unknown models as opposed to the store's usual cast of \"faces\" such as Twiggy and Lisa Snowdon. Investec analyst Bethany Hocking describes the change as \"high risk\". M&amp;S's long-serving fashion supremo Kate Bostock is leaving at the end of this month, and her part-time replacement Belinda Earl, the former Debenhams boss, is due to start work tomorrow. Earl helped establish successful in-house brands under the Designers at Debenhams label and she is doing the same with M&amp;S's six main womenswear brands, including Autograph, Per Una and Limited, which are felt not to be distinct enough. \"I don't think online is the holy grail for M&amp;S,\" continues Saunders. \"It's a piece of the jigsaw but not the whole picture \u2026 product comes first.\" After all, not all M&amp;S shoppers are ready for cyberspace. Pensioners Elaine and Maureen, trying out the hand creams in the store's beauty hall, prefer shopping the old-fashioned way. \"They are too complicated, those posh phones,\" says Maureen. \"I don't shop online, I want to see it first.\" And she admits to scouring the sale racks for bargains: \"I like Per Una, but it's a bit pricey.\"",

      "body": "<p>Bronwyn \u2013 proudly patting herself down and establishing that under her clothes and smart, hot-pink anorak it's just the \"bra and knickers\" that have been bought at her favourite store \u2013 says: \"I'm an M&amp;S&#xa0;lady.\"</p> <p>The 62-year-old retired social worker was one of hundreds of shoppers crowding the aisles of the new Marks &amp; Spencer superstore at Cheshire Oaks in Ellesmere Port when it opened last week. With a shop-floor area equivalent to the size of 11 Olympic swimming pools, the vast store \u2013 codenamed \"concept 11\" \u2013 is M&amp;S's best crack to date at merging the worlds of physical and online shopping.</p> <p>M&amp;S is trying to please loyal shoppers like Bronwyn who arrive at its stores armed with mobile phones in their handbags that have more computing power than the average PC of a decade ago. \"I'm one of the older generation \u2013 we get called silver surfers \u2013 who are switched on to modern technology,\" she explains.</p> <p>With the internet now part of the fabric of modern life, M&amp;S's digital guru Laura Wade-Gery, is firm: \"The high street is not going to stand still so we know that we can't.\" The executive, who was hired from Tesco last year, is behind the retailer's growing arsenal of interactive shopping technology. \"How do we use the internet to reinvent the store?\" she asks. \"It's as big a mission as that.\"</p> <p>In the Cheshire store, customers are invited to use \"browse and order\" hubs kitted out with giant touchscreens that look like they have been stolen from the Teletubbies. The latest clothing lines and home fashions are beamed from 70in \"inspirational\" displays, with additional backup provided by assistants prowling the shop floor armed with holstered iPads, ready to plug the gap between the thousands of products hanging on the rails and those out there in cyberspace.</p> <p>The striking store, which has a curvy wooden roof made of \"glulam\" (glued laminate) and hemp walls, might be M&amp;S's greenest to date, but in the six long years it has taken to come to fruition it has increasingly been argued that big stores are growing obsolete, as shoppers defect to the virtual high street.</p> <p>M&amp;S boss Marc Bolland admitted at the opening that if he could have turned back the clock, the monster store would have been \"a tad smaller\". At 151,000 sq&#xa0;ft it is unlikely M&amp;S will ever open such a large branch again. But with a catchment of 1.3 million people and \u00a34bn of local retail sales to go after, Bolland insisted it was not just a large store, but rather \"a shopping experience\".</p> <p>The shadow cast by the internet and now mobile shopping has spawned retail industry buzzwords such as \"multichannel\" and even \"omnichannel\", which attempt to describe how customers increasingly use both store and websites in tandem. Jargon aside, retailers find that the more channels their customers use, the more they spend. M&amp;S says shoppers who shop on its website as well in its stores spend four times as much; throw smartphones into the mix and they spend eight times as much.</p> <p>To that end Wade-Gery recites the Coca-Cola Company's famous goal to be \"<a href=\"http://heritage.coca-cola.com/timeline.swf\" title=\"\">within an arm's reach of desire</a>\", which helped it conquer the soft drinks market in the 20th century: \"We have to provide more ways for consumers to access M&amp;S.\"</p> <p>The retailer is spending \u00a3150m to upgrade its website, because for all the technical jiggery-pokery and free Wi-Fi at Cheshire Oaks, antiquated systems mean it still takes up to five days for items ordered in store to arrive. With multichannel sales accelerating in the second half of the last financial year, Wade-Gery suggests she is already making an impact on the retailer.</p> <p>Andy Morrey, M&amp;S's first e-commerce director, who has since founded retail consultancy <a href=\"http://www.enovapartnership.com/\" title=\"\">eNova</a>, says the high street is responding to consumer behaviour, not the other way around: \"There is no point launching a service or app just for the sake of it,\" he explains. \"It won't work unless it addresses a consumer need.\" A <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mcdonalds-uk/id363559703?mt=8\" title=\"\">McDonald's app</a> is reported to have been little used \"because nobody needed an app to find a McDonald's\".</p> <p>In his subsequent job at Argos, Morrey masterminded the launch of \"click and collect\", a service now taken for granted by shoppers: \"Nobody else had done it and the industry was very sceptical about whether it would be a success.\" Multichannel retailing is still in its infancy, he adds, predicting that faster broadband speeds and 4G will trigger more change.</p> <p>Most of M&amp;S's shoppers are aged over 40, and some analysts argue the internet is less relevant to it than chains with a younger clientele.
