      "bodyText": "There were fresh hopes of an end to the conflict between Cornish fishermen and their French counterparts, dubbed the \u201cscallop wars\u201d, on Monday night after it was announced that the two sides had come to a new agreement. Vessels from the two nations clashed over the summer in a dispute about access to fishing grounds in the Baie de Seine, north of Normandy. The French and British governments announced that a deal had been reached in early September, but those hopes were dashed last Thursday when talks broke down. Now it has been announced that another agreement has been reached. Under its terms, UK vessels of less than 15 metres would continue to be able to take scallops from the waters, but larger boats would cease activities in the Baie de Seine from Tuesday until the end of 30 October. National regulations allow British ships to fish legally in the area all year round, but French fishermen have been banned from taking scallops in the Baie de Seine between 15 May and 31 October at the latest to conserve stocks. A previous industry accord prevented UK vessels larger than 15 metres from doing so, but smaller ones could help themselves. When that deal broke down, tempers flared as French boats clashed with their British counterparts. About 35 French vessels confronted five British craft off the coast of northern France, with reports of rocks and smoke bombs being hurled at UK boats. The UK\u2019s fisheries minister, George Eustice, welcomed the deal. \u201cThis means our over-15-metre fleet will get the days at sea it wanted, while allowing the under-15-metre fleet to continue fishing in the area. I commend the UK fishing industry for its patience throughout negotiations and welcome this pragmatic outcome.\u201d Jim Portus, chief executive of the South Western Fish Producers Organisation, said: \u201cIndustry members were not entirely ecstatic about the French holding them to ransom since failing to sign the accord in July, but I think this is a better outcome than we faced at the end of last week.\u201d On 5 September, the governments of the UK and France released a joint statement saying \u201cconstructive\u201d talks had resulted in a deal under which the smaller British vessels would be covered by the conservation measures. The French government agreed to compensate British boats. But on 13 September, it was announced that the talks had broken down, with reports suggesting the amount of compensation required to end the standoff was too great.",

      "bodyText": "About time too. UK fund managers who will decide whether Unilever can go Dutch are starting to stir. David Cumming, the chief investment officer for equities at Aviva Investors, says his group will vote against the proposal. To encourage others to rebel, he adds that it\u2019s hard to see any advantage in Unilever\u2019s plan for any UK shareholder, which is a reasonable stance. Everybody understands by now Unilever\u2019s reasons for wanting to abandon its current Anglo-Dutch structure and incorporate in the Netherlands: it thinks deal-making and capital-raising would be easier without two classes of share, which is probably true. The problem is the effect of the revamp on UK funds. A Dutch-incorporated Unilever would retain a listing in London but, critically, wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the FTSE 100 index, the FTSE 350 index and FTSE All-Share indices. Exclusion is a big deal for the likes of Aviva, whose funds mostly track those indices or are benchmarked against them. For such funds, investing in Unilever would become either impossible or harder. At this point in the debate, Unilever might object that it would be terribly unfair if a minority of UK shareholders succeed in killing its proposal. The company needs a 75% majority among shareholders in the plc, which represents 45% of the whole of the Unilever. So, in effect, 11.3% of the entire shareholder base could block the will of the majority. The position is unsatisfactory but Unilever has brought it on itself. It cannot expect all UK fund managers just to swallow obediently and do what the board says is best. Fund managers have duties of their own, principally to their end-investors, the people who pay their fees. Cumming is merely doing his job in standing up for UK interests and arguing that a large, cash-generative core holding is not a stock to be surrendered without a very good reason. All the big traditional UK houses \u2013 Legal &amp; General, Standard Life Aberdeen, M&amp;G, and so on \u2013 are on the Unilever register. They should know that silence on this issue is not an option. They are paid to have a view \u2013 and to justify it to the people whose money they manage. Speak up. Is new Boohoo boss worth the money? Most successful upstart clothing retailers reach a point when the founders decide the business is best run, day to day, by an experienced operator from outside. Here\u2019s Boohoo\u2019s moment. John Lyttle, the No 2 at Primark, is joining as chief executive. Primark resolutely refuses to sell online, whereas that\u2019s all Lyttle\u2019s new employer does, but Boohoo\u2019s co-founders Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane probably figure they\u2019ve got the techie stuff covered. Lyttle\u2019s pay package, however, looks anything but sensible. On top of a \u00a3615,000 salary, plus the chance to earn a \u00a3922,000 bonus every year, the new man has been given the chance to collect a \u00a350m bonus if Boohoo\u2019s market capitalisation, adjusted from any share issues all the way, improves by 180% over five years. Boohoo justifies this on the grounds that a 180% improvement would see the company\u2019s stock market value rise from \u00a32bn to \u00a35.6bn, so Lyttle\u2019s \u00a350m slice would represent only 1.4% of the \u00a33.6bn gain. Yes, that\u2019s how the arithmetic works. And, since Kamani owns 30% of the stock with his family, and Kane has 4%, they can do more or less as they please on the remuneration front. However, one wonders whether they\u2019ve thought about the impact through the organisation. If you were a Boohoo executive outside the boardroom, you\u2019d surely be lobbying for a piece of the same five-year bonus bonanza. And why not? And why not further down the employee ranks? Lyttle may be good but the cult of the superstar chief executive is usually over-done. You\u2019re wrong, Bernard Jenkin; Brexit could drive carmakers away Jaguar Land Rover, when it cites \u201cheadwinds\u201d as the reason for switching 2,000 staff to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant, may chiefly be referring to sluggish demand for diesel vehicles. Brexit-induced uncertainty may be only a secondary factor. Yet there\u2019s still a moral here for Bernard Jenkin and those other Tory MPs who dismiss JLR\u2019s regular warnings about the effect of a hard Brexit as \u201cscaremongering\u201d. Car plants are robust in that they are hard to shift overnight but their economics are simultaneously fragile. A few unwelcome winds can force a change in the direction of investment. If diesel can cause a three-day working week, a hard Brexit next March could do far more damage. Jenkin should pipe down. Car companies, and their workers, are closer to the market than he is.",

      "bodyText": "The latest labour force figures, released last week, were a continuation of the very good news for people seeking work, but a report by the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) reveals that many \u2013 especially those in the so-called prime working ages \u2013 are struggling to gain work and are being left behind. First the good news \u2013 the unemployment rate is down to 5.3%, the lowest since 2012, and the underemployment rate has also fallen slightly. But at 8.3% it remains historically high and over the past 18 months there has been little change in the gap between the two rates. Whereas in the past the underemployment rate would generally be around 2% points higher than the unemployment rate, now it is around 3% points: This suggests a larger degree of \u201cspare capacity\u201d in the labour market \u2013 at every level of unemployment \u2013 than in the past. The growth of employment certainly has slowed this year. Whereas in 2017 employment grew by 3.4%, the past 12 months has seen growth of 2.5% \u2013 slower but still very much above what we have experienced over the past seven years. What is more concerning is that the annual growth of hours worked has slowed by more. In the past 12 months the growth of hours worked grew by just 1.8%: While this is not too bad, as a general rule the greater the gap between the annual growth of hours worked and employment the worse the economy is performing. Over the past 30 years, any time the gap between the two has been greater than 1% point, the economy is in a pretty bad way. We\u2019re not there yet, but it is worth keeping an eye on \u2013 especially as the slowing of annual employment growth appears to be coming to an end, while the slowing of growth in hours worked looks to be continuing. One reason is that part-time work is now surging, while the growth of full-time employment is slowing: The growth of part-time employment \u2013 which overwhelmingly is women \u2013 means that there are more people aged 25-64 in employment now than at any time in our history. Just over 77% of people aged 25-64 are now employed \u2013 well above the 75.6% who were employed just prior to the GFC: And yet it is clear this record has occurred due to the influx of women entering the workforce more than accounting for the decline in men. While the percentage of women aged 25-64 who are working has risen from 68.1% at the start of 2011 to 71.1% now, in the same period the percentage of men working has fallen from 84% to 83.2%. And more concerning is the big drop in the percentage of men in these prime-aged years working full-time. At the start of 2011, 75% of men aged 25-64 worked full-time \u2013 now it is 73.2%. Thankfully this has risen from the nadir of 72.5% in October 2016, but it still represents around 120,000 fewer men employed full-time than would have been the case had the level of 2011 remained in place: This goes to the issue for unemployed revealed in a study released on Friday by Acoss and Jobs Australia, Faces of Unemployment. It found that contrary to the stereotype of young people on the dole, it is those over the age of 45 who are overrepresented among Newstart recipients. While those over 45 make up 38% of the working age population, they account for 43% of those on Newstart or the Youth Allowance. Even worse is that 49% of the long-term recipients of Newstart are aged over 45. As such, suggestions that Newstart needs to be kept low to encourage people not to stay on welfare are laughable. Those on Newstart are more likely to be middle-aged parents than kids bumming around on the beach like in some screwed-up version of reality you might see in the tabloids. One reason the report found is that \u201cas unemployment falls, those who are less disadvantaged in the labour market find jobs more quickly, leaving behind the more disadvantaged groups\u201d. Those who are older are more likely to have health issues or disabilities, which in the past would have seen them on the disability support pension but which under \u201cthe welfare \u2018reforms\u2019 of the mid 2000s and 2010s\u201d which were designed to boost workforce participation, often merely just \u201cshifted people from higher [DSP] to lower [Newstart] social security payments.\u201d Crucially the report notes that \u201cthe labour market has changed so that jobs that were previously available to people with similar characteristics to today\u2019s recipients of unemployment payment (especially those with lower qualifications and skills) are either harder to get, or harder to keep\u201d. Indeed, at the end of 2002, just under 30% of all workers were either labourers, in sales or machinery operators and drivers \u2013 now it is just 25% - the equivalent of just over half a million fewer jobs in these three lowest skilled occupations: It highlights the need for a premium to be placed on education \u2013 both of those yet to enter the workforce and those who have lost their job in later years. But education is a medium-long term solution. The Acoss report found that the most effective short-term solution was wage subsidies for long-term employed. The report found that these lifted \u201cthe chances of leaving income support 12 months after a job placement by an average of 14 percentage points\u201d compared with a pathetic 2% increase for the government\u2019s preferred method of work-for-the-dole programs. The report\u2019s author, Peter Davidson, notes that \u201cthe main reason that wage subsidies are more effective is that people receive direct experience in a regular paid job, and are often kept on after the subsidy ends. Work-for-the-dole activities are further removed from regular employment.\u201d The good jobs figures are certainly encouraging. The solid growth in employment has now been going for over a year and half. But even within these good times are problems, especially for older workers dealing with the changing economy that sees a shift away from full-time low skilled work. It means there are plenty of cracks through which older workers can fall if they lose their job and why raising the rate of Newstart during a period when tax revenue is greatly exceeding expectations is a must. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

We\u2019re not there yet, but it is worth keeping an eye on \u2013 especially as the slowing of annual employment growth appears to be coming to an end, while the slowing of growth in hours worked looks to be continuing.</p> <p>One reason is that part-time work is now surging, while the growth of full-time employment is slowing:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Full-time and part-time employment - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/h3G2e/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The growth of part-time employment \u2013 which overwhelmingly is women \u2013 means that there are more people aged 25-64 in employment now than at any time in our history.

      "bodyText": "Kweku Adoboli, the banker convicted of the UK\u2019s biggest fraud, has been given a last-minute reprieve from deportation as a judge awarded a judicial review of his case. Adoboli, 38, was found guilty in 2012 of fraud that lost his employer UBS $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn), and he was due to be deported to Ghana on Tuesday. He was facing deportation because he had never applied for British citizenship despite having lived in the UK since he was 12. Under UK law, if a foreign national has been sentenced to more than four years in jail \u201cthe public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances\u201d. Adoboli, who left Ghana when he was four, was sentenced to seven years for the fraud and served half that time. Adoboli\u2019s deportation appeared all but sealed earlier on Monday when the immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, refused to intervene to review the deportation order, despite appeals from 132 MPs and a petition signed by more than 73,000 people. Nokes said the decision to deport Adoboli had been \u201cupheld independently, at several stages, by the courts\u201d and it would be inappropriate for her to act. With the hours ticking down to his departure, Adoboli\u2019s lawyers submitted an application for a judicial review of his case in a last-ditch attempt to prevent his \u201cbanishment\u201d from his friends and family in the UK. Adoboli had already had an application for judicial review rejected by the courts, and his lawyers were not confident the final attempt \u2013 made on public interest grounds \u2013 would succeed. But a judge granted the appeal for judicial review and injunction against deportation. Adoboli\u2019s lawyers expect him to be freed from an immigration removal centre near Heathrow airport within days and released on bail until the outcome of the judicial review, which could take several months. Adoboli\u2019s lawyer, Jacqui McKenzie, said: \u201cCommon sense has broken out: sending a 38-year-old man to a country where he has not lived since the age of four was always madness, given that he has lived in Britain since the age of 12 and the UK is where his friends and partner live and where his family life is based. It is unquestionably his home. Let\u2019s hope that will be the judgment, as and when it is made.\u201d Hannah Bardell, Adoboli\u2019s MP, who had led a campaign to keep him in the UK, said on Twitter: \u201cA really incredible result, we never gave up hope and we\u2019ll keep fighting!\u201d In explaining her decision not to intervene to prevent the deportation, Nokes said: \u201cAlthough Mr Adoboli\u2019s offence was not one of violence, he committed a serious offence and this was reflected in the length of his sentence. Financial crime, like all crime, has an impact on the society that we live in and the public expects robust action to be taken against foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crime. \u201cAfter consideration of all the individual circumstances of his case, the Home Office was satisfied that Mr Adoboli\u2019s case does not meet any of the exceptions in the 2007 [Borders] Act and a deportation order was served on him on 22 July 2014. The decision to deport him has been upheld independently, at several stages, by the courts. His application to appeal to the court of appeal was dismissed on 28 June 2018 and on 13 August his application for a judicial review was refused.\u201d Nokes said the government was \u201ccommitted to a fair and humane immigration policy\u201d and she rejected the suggestion that Adoboli\u2019s treatment was similar to that of the Windrush generation of immigrants. \u201cThe Home Office recognises the weight of dissatisfaction towards the treatment of the Windrush generation and officials are working hard to put this right,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not believe that the issues faces by the Windrush generation, who were legally resident in the United Kingdom but did not have the documentation to prove it, are analogous to Mr Adoboli\u2019s case.\u201d Nokes has previously blocked at least two British citizens on Twitter when they asked for her assistance after the Home Office failed to respond to their complaints or appeals from their MPs.",

      "bodyText": "Surveying the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis (A decade on, rethink the relationship between the state and the market, Editorial, 15 September), you rightly call for the vacuum created by the collapse of free-market economics to be filled. But you wrongly imply that no one has done this. In fact, there has been huge progress in building an alternative. Economists have a better analysis of how sustainable growth and innovation occur, and how the state can co-invest with industry to meet challenges such as climate change and an ageing society. It is clear that the decline in bargaining power in an overly casualised labour market has held down wages, and that both stronger trade unions and regulation are needed to raise low-income earnings and productivity. The role of the financial sector in causing financial instability, short-termism and wealth inequality is much better understood, and new public institutions \u2013 from a national investment bank to regional economic government and a new digital regulator \u2013 are now on the table. All these and more are proposed in a recent report by the IPPR commission on economic justice, Prosperity and Justice: A Plan for the New Economy. And they are underpinned by an analysis of the purpose of the economy and the relationship between state and markets. Government policy has not moved on much in the past decade, but thinking has. It\u2019s time to turn the latter into the former. Michael Jacobs Director, the IPPR commission on economic justice \u2022 Your editorial is spot-on in summarising the failings of the global and UK economies \u2013 public services are cut, wages stagnate, living standards fall. What is needed is a drastic change in economic policy. Instead of regarding the economy as a household where it is vital for income to cover expenditure, governments should draw on the \u201cmagic money tree\u201d that bailed out banks with quantitative easing to the tune of \u00a3435bn in the UK and trillions worldwide. This should take the form of a green new deal, where major investment is made in infrastructure, energy conservation for buildings and renewable energy. There is sufficient underemployment in the UK for extra money to be spent on these projects without the danger of Weimar Republic-type hyperinflation. Adopting a green new deal strategy will boost employment and wages through the \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d, and go a long way towards fending off runaway climate change. Bill Hughes Swindon, Wiltshire \u2022 I agree with your editorial. Comparisons between 2008 and 1929 are apt, as are your calls for a counter-revolution in ideas aimed at resetting the boundaries between state and market, and reconsidering how a civilised society should treat its people. You call for a fundamental review of the role of government in providing a good economic life for voters. A recent report from the Institute of Employment Rights echoes your sentiments, taking as its lead the successful policies adopted by governments following the 1929 crash and the devastation after the second world war. We call for a ministry of labour, led by a secretary of state with a cabinet seat, to represent workers\u2019 voices in parliament. Its responsibilities will include introducing a collective bargaining act, wages high enough to reduce reliance on in-work state benefits, strategies to ensure technological advances increase productivity not unemployment, and appropriate training and education to reduce skills gaps. The bargaining act will be responsible for rolling out national joint councils across the economy to negotiate pay and conditions in their sector. We also propose strengthening the safety net for workers by an extension of employment rights suitable for the challenges of the modern workplace, with strengthened enforcement mechanisms to turn paper rights into enforceable rights. The free market has failed. Austerity has failed. It is widely acknowledged that collective bargaining at sectoral level is the best way to put money in workers\u2019 pockets, increase the tax take, reduce the cost spent on state benefits, stimulate demand and productivity and decrease the levels of inequality that so harm our society. Carolyn Jones Director, Institute of Employment Rights \u2022 Larry Elliott highlights the shocking demise of trade union collective bargaining from a 1970s high of 70% to 26% today (The rise in zero-hours can only be halted by strong unions, 14 September). On this 10-year anniversary of Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse, a further overlooked failing is the refusal to recognise union affiliation, power and rights. There is a powerful argument that, had union representation been an established feature of the high-finance arena, individuals would have felt empowered and protected in voicing their concerns at the overleveraged, high-risk strategies that had become unassailable. We all suffered for this silence. Whistleblowing mechanisms are far stronger today, but this doesn\u2019t prevent the lone voice who seeks to expose looming catastrophe from the constraining solitude that only a trade union can overcome, empower and protect. Nick Mayer Southampton, Hampshire \u2022 Stronger unions would surely do good for Britain, but Larry Elliott is mistaken in claiming that is the only way to reduce zero-hours contracting. Here\u2019s a plan that would eliminate most of it, while preserving enough flexibility to avoid inefficiency. The idea is to legislate a limit on the fraction of working hours a company can assign to people other than full-time employees. The limit could kick in when it uses five or more full-time equivalents for certain work. At that point, the law might require at least 60% be done by full-time employees (three of them, in this scenario), so that no more than 40% could be done through other arrangements including zero-hours contracts. As that kind of work increases, the limit would decrease, perhaps to as low as 15% for companies with many workers on one job, such as Uber and Deliveroo. A full-time employee does not necessarily have to have a fixed schedule. Working hours could be scheduled weekly, in accord with certain rules. Workers deserve to know their schedule. Any shift not scheduled in advance, regardless of the terms of employment, should pay 50% extra on top of overtime pay if it is overtime.

      "bodyText": "The punctuality of Britain\u2019s trains has reached a 12-year low amid disruption caused by extreme weather and timetable changes, according to \u201cdamning\u201d statistics that emerged as the government weighs up launching a full-blown rail review. One in seven trains missed the industry\u2019s target of arriving within five minutes of their scheduled time \u2013 or 10 minutes on long-distance services \u2013 in the year to 18 August, according to figures from the Office of Road and Rail (ORR). That means 14% of trains were late, the highest for a 12-month period since the 14.2% recorded in February 2006, the Press Association said. The latest punctuality data comes in the week that the ORR is due to publish a report into the chaos experienced by rail users affected by the redrawing of timetables. New timetables took effect on 20 May and affected users of the Northern and Thameslink networks particularly badly, leaving thousands of commuters stranded by reduced or cancelled services. The debacle came hard on the heels of a spell of freezing weather nicknamed the \u201cBeast from the East\u201d, which crippled parts of the network in February and March. Peter Vicary-Smith, the chief executive of consumer group Which?, said: \u201cThese latest statistics are damning but unsurprising, given a year of delays and cancellations that have left many passengers at their wits\u2019 end. \u201cWe\u2019ve shared hundreds of stories with the regulator \u2013 including from people who have frequently missed their child\u2019s bedtimes and faced losing jobs as a result of the chaos. \u201cWith trust in the industry at an all-time low, it is vital that the outcome of any inquiry or review reflects the needs and experiences of passengers. \u201cAs a starting point, the government must introduce auto compensation so that passengers get the money that they are owed.\u201d Several factors have previously been blamed for the network\u2019s inability to cope with bad weather and timetable changes. They include delays to electrification projects in the north of England, poor planning by train operators and the decision by transport ministers to phase in the introduction of new Govia Thameslink Railway services. There is also growing speculation that the government will launch a full-blown review of the railway system this week, amid mounting criticism of a franchising model that has resulted in passengers being hit with annual fare rises despite regular disruption. Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cThe delays and cancellations on our railways is fast becoming a national disgrace thanks to the Tories. \u201cWith fares up set to go up by 36% since 2010, it\u2019s clear that passengers are paying more for less. \u201cNobody should have to suffer daily delays as part of their commute but under the Tories, passengers are paying through the nose for the privilege of being crammed into late and overcrowded trains. \u201cThe government\u2019s blind obsession with privatisation is putting the future of our railways at risk. \u201cLabour will do what\u2019s best for passengers and taxpayers by taking the railways into public ownership in order to improve services and cap fares.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola is considering developing a range of marijuana-infused beverages to help ease physical problems such as inflammation, pain and cramps. The world\u2019s largest drinks company is in talks with major Canadian marijuana producer Aurora Cannabis, but stressed that it was interested in the properties of cannabis that treat pain but do not get users high. The talks come as Canada prepares to legalise cannabis for recreational use, after many years of permitting it for medicinal purposes. Coca-Cola said it was monitoring the industry and was interested in developing new drinks infused with CBD or cannabidiol, the non-psychoactive ingredient found in cannabis plants which alleviates pain. It said: \u201cAlong with many others in the beverage industry, we are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world. The space is evolving quickly.\u201d Many cannabis advocates argue that it is is capable of relieving conditions including arthritis and diabetes. The legal low-concentrate CBD oil is said to be beneficial for promoting sleep, boosting appetite and reducing stress, depression and anxiety. In Los Angeles, CBD is among the latest wellness fads. It is being added to cocktails and an upmarket juice bar will add a few drops of CBD-infused olive oil to a beverage for $3.50 (\u00a32.66). Coca-Cola insisted \u201cno decisions have been made at this time\u201d and said it would not comment on further speculation. It did not confirm or deny the link with Aurora Cannabis, which was first reported by Canadian broadcaster BNN Bloomberg. However, its interest in the marijuana sector comes as the fizzy soft drinks that made its name are in decline. Last month, Coca-Cola announced that it was buying the Costa Coffee chain in a near-\u00a34bn deal that underlined the growing appeal of the global coffee market. Canada is an obvious major market for a new wave of commercially produced drinks, given that recreational cannabis use is set to be legalised on 17 October. At the beginning of August, it was announced that Canadian brewer Molson Coors had struck a deal with The Hydropothecary Corporation, a Canadian cannabis producer, to launch a new standalone business which aims to develop \u201cnon-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages for the Canadian market following legalisation\u201d. Diageo, the maker of Guinness beer, is holding discussions with at least three Canadian cannabis producers about a possible deal, according to BNN Bloomberg. Heineken NV\u2019s Lagunitas craft-brewing label has even launched a brand specialising in non-alcoholic drinks infused with THC, marijuana\u2019s active ingredient. However Coca-Cola is the first major non-alcoholic drinks manufacturer to consider such a move. It is not clear whether Coca-Cola\u2019s plans will eventually extend to the UK, but the revelation was a surprise to UK-based executives. Some forms of cannabis oil are already available to buy for medical purposes in British pharmacies. The legal low-concentrate CBD oil is said to be beneficial for treating a number of complaints as well as promoting sleep, boosting appetite and reducing stress, depression and anxiety. A recent research study from scientists at King\u2019s College, London, found that a single dose of cannabidiol may help people with psychotic disorders by dampening down abnormal brain activity. A single dose reduced unusual patterns of neural behaviour linked to hallucinations, delusions and other symptoms of psychosis, researchers found after examining brain scans.",

      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover has announced that about 2,000 staff will move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in the West Midlands, only hours after the carmaker was accused of \u201cscaremongering\u201d about the impact of Brexit by a Conservative MP. JLR, owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata, said it had made the decision to reduce production as it wrestles with difficult conditions in the automotive industry, caused by Brexit and slumping sales of diesel-powered cars. Staff are expected to work reduced hours until at least Christmas. A spokesperson said: \u201cIn light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some temporary adjustments to our production schedules at Castle Bromwich. \u201cWe are, however, continuing to overproportionally invest in new products and technologies, and are committed to our UK plants in which we have invested more than \u00a34bn since 2010 to future-proof manufacturing technologies to deliver new models.\u201d The chief executive, Ralf Speth, has previously cited uncertainty over Brexit and confusion over government policy on diesel engines as factors limiting JLR\u2019s prospects, after it cut 1,000 jobs at its Solihull plant in April. He also warned last week that tens of thousands of jobs in the automotive sector would be at risk if the UK crashes out of the EU without agreeing an exit deal with Brussels. The company, which employs 40,000 people in the UK, has previously warned it would have to reconsider \u00a380bn of UK investment over five years in the event of a no-deal Brexit because a disorderly departure from the EU would hinder access to the single market and disrupt the flow of car parts into the UK. The Castle Bromwich site makes the Jaguar XF, XJ and XE saloons and the F-Type sports car. On Monday morning, hours before JLR revealed its plan for production schedules at Castle Bromwich, the pro-Brexit Tory MP Bernard Jenkin accused Speth of \u201cscaremongering\u201d over Brexit and \u201cmaking it up\u201d. The shadow business minister, Rebecca Long-Bailey, responded to Jenkin\u2019s comments, saying JLR\u2019s move \u201cshows just how much the continued uncertainty around Brexit is hurting jobs and investment. \u201cIt is irresponsible for senior Tories to dismiss the genuine concerns from businesses about the government\u2019s chaotic handling of Brexit. \u201cThe Tories cannot continue to spar with each other and play ideological games whilst British jobs and industries are being pushed off the edge of a cliff.\u201d The Labour MP Jack Dromey, whose Erdington constituency includes the Castle Bromwich plant, said: \u201cBrexit now threatens the jewel in the crown of British manufacturing excellence. Ministers must get it right or the future is bleak. \u201cThis morning, a wide-eyed Brexiter, Bernard Jenkin MP, in his ideological zeal, accused Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Ralf Speth of \u2018making it up\u2019. \u201cNow we know fears are justified. A hard Brexit or no deal will be catastrophic for Britain\u2019s automotive industry.\u201d The car industry has also been affected by confusion among consumers about whether or not they should buy diesel cars, which has sent sales sliding. Drivers are worried that the government is planning to penalise diesel cars with higher taxes, including at local level through city pollution charges, to address fears about the fuel\u2019s environmental impact. Prof David Bailey, an automotive expert at Aston University, said Brexit and diesel were a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d for JLR. \u201cBrexit uncertainty dragged down the market overall,\u201d he said. \u201cOn top of that, the shift away from diesel hurts JLR especially because over 90% of their sales last year were diesel.\u201d He warned that Castle Bromwich was a particularly vulnerable plant, which narrowly avoided closure in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cIf there is a hard Brexit, I do fear for its future,\u201d he said. The automotive industry, which employs 186,000 people in the UK, has been among the most vocal sectors in British industry about the pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit. The chief executive of the sector\u2019s trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), warned this year that auto firms were not ready for this scenario, with the official exit date of 29 March 2019 looming. Asked if there were any potential Brexit benefits for the British automotive industry, which has a combined annual turnover of \u00a382bn, Mike Hawes said: \u201cNot that we can see.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2018. About 2,000 JLR staff will move to a three-day week, not more than 3,000 as an earlier version said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, a quiet day\u2019s trading on Britain\u2019s stock market has ended. The FTSE 100 index closed just two points lower at 7,302 (or down a barely noticeable 0.03%). Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the US-China trade dispute kept a lid on shares today. The FTSE had a slightly choppy day, with a mid-morning recovery cut short by the US markets starting to slide as US-China tensions escalated again. A set of different media reports is coming from the US, most of them still unconfirmed, saying that the US might tone down its initial plans to introduce a 25% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and instead bring in tariffs of only 10%. Other news reports are more prominently carrying President Trump\u2019s comments about how the tariffs have put the US in a good negotiating position. Amidst all of this China is saying that it will respond in kind to any US move but more worryingly is threatening to walk away from near term negotiations altogether, which would cement the tariff system for the time being. The trade tit-for-tat is keeping the markets in Europe, Asia and the US on their toes over the possible escalation of the conflict and is deflecting focus from any other underlying regional drivers, such as the fundamentally fairly strong state of the US economy. The dollar is weaker against the pound, the euro and the yen and is just holding the line against the Canadian dollar. And on that note, goodnight! GW The Labour Party has now weighed in, urging chancellor Philip Hammond to hammer home the IMF\u2019s warning to his cabinet colleagues. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, says: \u201cToday the IMF has underlined the warnings that we\u2019ve already heard from trade unions and business organisations about the damage that a cliff edge Brexit would do to our economy. \u201cOnce again I call on the Chancellor to show some leadership and make it clear to his colleagues that he will not accept a no deal Brexit and the damage it risks doing to jobs, wages and living standards in this country\u201d. Time for a recap: The International Monetary Fund has warned that Britain\u2019s economy will be hit hard if the country leaves the EU without a deal. In its latest assessment of the UK economy, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said a no-deal Brexit would hit growth and weaken the pound. She told a press conference in London that: \u201cIf that happened there would be dire consequences. It would inevitably have consequences in terms of reduced growth, an increase in the [budget] deficit and a depreciation of the currency. \u201cIn relatively short order it would mean a reduction in the size of the economy.\u201d The IMF warned that the UK economy will be permanently smaller after Brexit, regardless of the flavour, compared to staying in the EU and enjoying frictionless trade. The Fund also warned that Britain faces a \u201cdaunting\u201d list of tasks to clear before Brexit in March 2019, adding: The massive scope of work that remains and the limited time before the UK exits the EU would likely leave preparations incomplete on departure day despite even the most determined efforts. In a pointed nod to some of his own colleagues, chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK must heed Lagarde\u2019s warning and ensure a close relationship with the EU for the future. Otherwise, Hammond claims, the UK could lose the progress made since the financial crsisis. Stock markets in Asia have fallen, following reports that America could impose tariffs on an extra $200bn of Chinese imports this week. The Shanghai stock exchange has hit its lowest level since 2014, as trade war fears swept local exchanges. Donald Trump has ratcheted up the pressure, warning that countries who don\u2019t play fair will be \u201ctariffed\u201d.... In a worrying sign for Britain\u2019s auto industry, 3,000 staff at Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s plant at Castle Bromwich are moving to a three-day week. My colleague Rob Davies reports: The news came hours after the carmaker was accused of \u201cscaremongering\u201dabout the impact of Brexit by a Conservative MP. JLR, owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata, said it had made the decision to reduce production in the light of difficult conditions in the automotive industry, amid sluggish demand. A spokesperson said: \u201cIn light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some temporary adjustments to our production schedules at Castle Bromwich. Just in, growth in New York\u2019s factory sector has slowed this month. The Empire manufacturing index of business conditions has dropped to 19 this month, sharply down on August\u2019s 25.6. Firms reported a slowdown in new orders, and a rise in costs -- perhaps a sign that the trade war is hurting. The IMF have now uploaded Christine Lagarde\u2019s opening statement at today\u2019s Article Four press conference on the UK economy. Here\u2019s the key section, on Brexit: For the UK, we are projecting growth of about 1\u00bd percent this year and next , down from about 1\u00be percent in 2016 and 2017. As we noted last year, Brexit-related effects are the driving factor for the slowdown in growth since the referendum. This has occurred despite strong policy frameworks and implementation. Uncertainty about the future economic environment has weighed on investment, despite still robust global growth and easy financing conditions, while the post-referendum depreciation of sterling has depressed real income growth and consumption. While exports have picked up thanks to the weaker currency, they have not done so by enough to prevent an overall slowing of growth. Despite the more modest growth, however, employment continues to reach record levels, and the unemployment rate is near historic lows. Our projections assume a timely agreement with the EU on a broad free trade pact and a relatively smooth Brexit process after that. A more disruptive departure will have a much worse outcome. Let me be clear: compared with today\u2019s smooth single market, all the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy , and to a lesser extent for the EU, as well. The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship, the costlier it will be. This should be obvious, but it seems that sometimes it is not. We should not understate the progress that has been achieved in the Brexit negotiations , most notably the tentative agreement on an implementation period. But many critical issues remain unresolved, most significantly a political agreement on the future economic relationship between the UK and the EU and the status of the Irish land border. We encourage both the UK and the EU to work diligently to reach agreement on these open issues to avoid a very costly cliff edge Brexit. The BBC have helpfully tweeted two video clips of Christine Lagarde speaking this morning. Here she is, explaining how all the possible Brexit scenarios have a cost for the UK economy, and Europe too. And here\u2019s Lagarde on the specific negative consequences of a no-deal Brexit. Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman has played down the IMF\u2019s claim that a no-deal Brexit would be very costly for Britain. The Press Association has the details: Chancellor Hammond said the report underlined the need for a Brexit deal to ensure the economic gains of the past decade were not lost. \u201cWe are at a critical juncture for the UK economy. Despite the contingency actions we are taking, leaving without a deal would put at risk the substantial progress the British people have made over the last 10 years,\u201d he said. Downing Street stopped short of an explicit endorsement of Mr Hammond\u2019s warning. When asked whether the Prime Minister backed her Chancellor\u2019s assessment, Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman told reporters: \u201cThe PM said very clearly that she believes our best days are ahead of us and we will have plans in place to allow us to succeed in all scenarios.\u201d Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, has warned that the IMF\u2019s new forecasts could be too optimistic. \u201cThe IMF forecast of 1.5% growth for UK GDP both this year and next comes on the same day as some even more pessimistic forecasts from the British Chambers of Commerce (who are now forecasting 1.1% and 1.3% growth in 2018 and 2019 respectively). In both cases, risks posed by Brexit are to the fore. Professor Johnes is also concerned that Brexit is distracting minister other issues (such as fixing productivity, as Lagarde pointed out this morning) The IMF emphasises actions which the UK needs to take, specifically in the arenas of productivity and regional development, to stimulate improved growth. While, in the Industrial Strategy and the Northern Powerhouse, the government has measures in place, these have necessarily taken a back seat over the last two years, and renewed efforts are needed.\u201d Meanwhile in America, Donald Trump is awake...and threatening that countries who don\u2019t trade fairly will be \u201ctariffed\u201d: (Mr Morici was speaking on Fox and Friends, one of the president\u2019s favourite shows) Labour MP David Lammy MP says the IMF\u2019s gloomy forecasts prove that the UK should hold a second referendum on Brexit. Lammy, who supports the Best for Britain campaign, says: \u201cThe IMF report proves beyond doubt that the Tories\u2019 plans would act as a sledgehammer to the UK economy. The substantial costs would weigh disproportionately on those with the least. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair on the most vulnerable in this country. The Prime Minister might try to trumpet this report as a victory for her Chequers plan, but doing so would be to deceive the British people. She and the Brexit extremists who have held a gun to the country\u2019s head should take responsibility for this entire mess. \u201cNo deal would be a nightmare - that\u2019s for certain. We need a people\u2019s vote with the option to stay in the EU.\u201d Here\u2019s more snap reaction to the IMF press conference. Reuters has focused on Christine Lagarde\u2019s warning that a no-deal Brexit would be bad for growth: Shehab Khan of the Independent fears the impact of Brexit on the UK people: The BBC\u2019s Katie Hile points out that Lagarde hasn\u2019t given up hope that a Brexit deal will be reached: I missed this point earlier, but the IMF may also be preparing to cut its global growth forecasts: Q: You says Britain faces \u201cdaunting\u2019 Brexit challenges, so would a 21-month transition period actually be long enough? Christine Lagarde replies that any extension to the proposed transition arrangement would be welcomed by those officials charged with negotiating new deals. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: Does the IMF believe there will actually be a Brexit dividend, or not? Christine Lagarde says Britain faces a short-term cost from Brexit, and a separate long-term dividend, which arrives gradually over time. But these two may not be the same size, she warns. Philip Gerson, the IMF\u2019s UK mission chief, weighs in too, warning: The UK will be permanently smaller [after Brexit], and that means permanently lower revenues. Q: What should policymakers do, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal? Lagarde reiterates that a a No deal Brexit would be a severe supply shock to UK economy. And in that case, she doesn\u2019t think a fiscal response would address the roots of the problem. In other words, don\u2019t expect the government to boost spending. On the workload issue, Lagarde says Britain needs to negotiate 63 trade deals in case there is a no-deal Brexit. That\u2019s a \u201check of a lot of work\u201d, she says dryly. Christine Lagarde says she \u201chopes and prays\u201d that there will be a deal between the UK and the EU (on her last visit, she said a no-deal Brexit was unimaginable). Q: Would a no-deal Brexit push the UK into recession? Christine Lagarde says the IMF\u2019s economists are working on its forecasts for different Brexit scenarios, and will present them to its Board in November. Q: Could Britain could use a \u201cBrexit dividend\u201d to provide extra funding for the National Health Service (the Brexit bus pledge)? Lagarde warns that any Brexit dividend won\u2019t come into the UK purse instantly, it will come over a period instead. So, I don\u2019t think you can actually front-load what is due to come later to address a financing that is needed now. Q: Is the Brexit debate distracting politicians from tackling other economic problems? Lagarde replies icily that Britain\u2019s productivity would certainly improve if the same level of passion directed at Brexit was put into tackling the productivity crisis. Christine Lagarde is now taking questions. She declines to answer a question about a possible second referendum Q: Why would a no-deal Brexit be so bad? If that was to happen, it would have severe economic consequences, Lagarde predicts. \u201cIt would be a shock to supply, and would result in reduced growth, increased deficit, depreciation of the currency...and in reasonable short order, it would mean a reduction in the size of the UK economy. Lagarde also warns that the UK economy will be weaker after Brexit, whatever deal is reached. \u201cAny deal would not be as good as the smooth process under which goods, services, people and capital move between the EU and the UK without barriers, without impediments and obstacles. Whatever the deal is will not be as good as it is at the moment. Christine Lagarde says that Brexit isn\u2019t the only challenge facing the UK. Productivity is another bugbear. By the average Thursday afternoon, the average US or German worker has produced as much as a UK worker manages by Friday afternoon, she points out. But there are reasons for hope too. Lagarde says Britain can take comfort from its \u201clong and glorious history\u201d and the strength of its people. [given today\u2019s gloomy warnings, we may need it....] IMF chief Christine Lagarde is now speaking. She warns that a no-deal Breixt would impose very large costs on the UK economy. Leaving the EU without an agreement is the most significant near-term risk to the UK economy, she continues. Lagarde confirms that the IMF expects the UK will only grow by 1.5% this year and next year. Brexit effects are the main reason for this slowdown, she says. Those forecasts are based on the assumption that the UK and EU reach a deal, Lagarde reminds her audience. A No-deal Brexit would have more disruptive effects on growth. Turning to trade, Lagarde warns that all the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy, and to a lesser extent for the EU as well. \u201cThis should be fairly obvious, but it seems that sometimes it isn\u2019t,\u201d she adds with a shrug. The IMF and the Treasury are holding a press conference in London now to discuss today\u2019s \u201cArticle IV\u201d report. Uk chancellor Philip Hammond speaks first, saying the UK economy is \u201cfundamentally strong\u201d. He points out that that unemployment is at a 43-year low. But we have reached a critical juncture for the UK economy, Hammond continues. He says Britain must reach a \u201cclose and enduring partnership\u201d with its EU partners, and not put the achievements of recent years at risk. Hammond adds that we must heed the IMF\u2019s warning of the \u201csignificant cost\u201d that not reaching a deal will have on British jobs and British prosperity. Some instant reaction to the IMF\u2019s new healthcheck on the UK economy, and its Brexit warning: The IMF also warns that a no-deal Brexit would be much worse for the UK than the negotiated exit which Theresa May is pushing for. Today\u2019s report says: Brexit negotiations have yielded agreement in principle on a 21-month implementation period. If ratified, this would allow important additional time to prepare for the new relationship between the UK and EU. However, fundamental questions\u2014such as the future economic relationship between the two and the closely-related question of the status of the land border with Ireland\u2014remain unanswered. Resolving these issues is critical to avoid a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit on WTO terms that would entail substantial costs for the UK economy\u2014and to a lesser extent the EU economies\u2014particularly if it were to occur in a disorderly fashion. While all likely Brexit outcomes will entail costs for the UK economy by departing from the frictionless single market that now prevails, an agreement that minimizes the introduction of new tariff and nontariff barriers would best protect growth and incomes in the UK and EU. Over time, new trade agreements with countries outside the EU could eventually pare some of these losses for the UK. However, such agreements are unlikely to bring sufficient benefits to offset the costs imposed by leaving the EU. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund is warning that Britain faces a \u201cdaunting\u201d list of challenges ahead of Brexit next spring. In its latest healthcheck on the UK economy, just released, the Fund points out that growth has \u201cmoderated\u201d since the EU referendum of 2016. This means that the UK has underperformed major rivals. The IMF says: Uncertainty over the terms of the EU withdrawal has weighed on private sector activity. Above-target inflation following the sharp post-referendum sterling depreciation has slowed real income and consumption growth. Business investment has been lower than would be expected in the context of robust global growth and favorable financing conditions. The softening of domestic demand was partially offset by a higher contribution from net exports, supported by weaker sterling and strong external demand. Overall, growth fell to about 1\u00be percent in 2016-17, moving the United Kingdom from the top to near the bottom of the G7 growth tables. The employment rate, however, continues to reach record highs. The IMF estimates that the UK will probably grow by around 1.5% this year, and in 2019 \u2014 below its long-run average. That projection assumes \u201ctimely agreement\u201d of a Brexit trade deal, and a smooth transition. However.... A more disruptive departure from the EU could lead to a significantly worse outcome, especially if it were to occur without an implementation period. By contrast, an agreement featuring fewer impediments to trade than currently expected could buoy business and consumer confidence, leading to faster growth. And even if a transition deal is agreed, many challenges lie ahead. Indeed, the \u2018massive\u2019 workload can\u2019t be cleared by March 2019, the IMF believes, even if both sides work constructively at top speed. As today\u2019s Article IV Mission, puts it: The range of remaining issues to prepare for Brexit is daunting, underscoring the importance of securing an implementation period. The UK will have to bolster human, physical, and IT resources in customs and other services, and establish domestic agencies to replace EU ones. In addition, the government will need to renegotiate the hundreds of bilateral and multilateral international agreements to which it is now party via its EU membership. Many of the required tasks cannot be initiated until there is greater clarity on the future trade relationship with the EU or even until Brexit occurs. The massive scope of work that remains and the limited time before the UK exits the EU would likely leave preparations incomplete on departure day despite even the most determined efforts. This risks serious disruptions without an implementation period in place. Co-ordination and co-operation between the EU and UK on priority issues, such as ensuring air traffic continues to flow, would be to the benefit of both parties. Joint technical discussions between UK and EU experts could facilitate this process. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research at FXTM, says the US-China trade dispute is worrying investors as they returned to their desks today. There is no disputing that one of the main contributors to the uncertain external environment is mixed messages when it comes to the status of trade talks between the United States and China. Conflicting reports remained a theme over the weekend when indications circulated that on one hand President Trump has provided the green light for additional Chinese tariffs being met, with other reports that Beijing was considering rejecting the offer from Washington to resume trade talks. This ultimately suggests to investors that we are no closer to an \u201cexit\u201d door when it comes to prolonged trade uncertainty. As such, it wouldn\u2019t be a major surprise if investors remain \u201crisk off\u201d as trading for the week gets underway Boom! China\u2019s stock market has closed at its lowest level since 2014, as traders brace for fresh US tariffs. Today\u2019s 1.1% slide takes the Shanghai Composite Index down to 2,651 points, the weakest point since late November 2014. Every sector on the index lost ground, following those reports that president Trump could sign off $200bn of new tariffs this week. European stock markets have opened cautiously, as trade worries weigh on investors. Germany\u2019s DAX has dropped by half a percent, while the FTSE 100 has dipped a toe into the red. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: European equity markets have started the week lower, following Asian markets down, as President Trump mulls new tariffs against China. President Trump\u2019s style is to escalate the pressure to try and generate as much leverage as he can in any potential negotiation, but China may not play his game, with reports that they are considering pulling out of any trade talks, making it difficult to see a resolution to the tensions in the short term. The Global Times newspaper, published by the Chinese Communist Party, has vowed to launch a \u2018beautiful\u2019 counterattack if the US imposes more tariffs. Reuters has the details: \u201cIt is nothing new for the U.S. to try to escalate tensions so as to exploit more gains at the negotiating table,\u201d the Global Times, which is published by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily, wrote in an editorial on Monday. \u201cWe are looking forward to a more beautiful counter-attack and will keep increasing the pain felt by the U.S.,\u201d the Chinese-language column said. Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u2019t impressed by the prospect of America slapping fresh tariffs on Chinese goods: It is all change in the flip-flop world of US trade policy. Media reports suggest US President Trump will impose yet more taxes on Americans who dare to buy things partially made in China. There are also reports China will refuse to attend trade talks with the US. This is not official \u2013 there are no tweets \u2013 but Asian markets reacted. Trade issues and their impact on the global economy are likely to dominate investor focus this week, says Stephen Innes of foreign exchange group OANDA. Innes says Trump\u2019s push for fresh tariffs on Chinese goods could undermine Treasury Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s attempts to broker a trade deal with China. China officials will continue to be frustrated. This good cop / bad cop routine continues to undermine Mr Mnuchin\u2019s efforts as it\u2019s still not clear if anyone other the Trump himself is commissioned to cut a deal. And not too unexpectedly and quite ominously China could cancel the meeting. But assuming the Tariff go through Tuesday, given that this is not so unexpected I guess the big question is 10 % or 25%, and I suspect this is where the event tail risk lies. If Trump comes out with 25 %, we could get an outsized market reaction. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new week, but investors are fretting about a familiar fear - Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars. Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US president is poised to impose a fresh round of tariffs targeting about $200 billion in Chinese goods, from consumer products to machinery and chemicals. According to the Journal, the tariffs are expected to be set at around 10%, rather than the 25% which Trump recently floated. It reported that: President Trump\u2019s decision..is designed to give the US more leverage in discussions with China over allegations that Beijing coerces American firms into handing over valuable technology to Chinese peers. Even so, such a move would escalate the trade dispute with China and doubtless provoke a retaliation. As one senior Chinese official put it: \u201cChina is not going to negotiate with a gun pointed to its head.\u201d The US first floated these tariffs in July, putting the idea out to consultation. That process ended last week, and the WSJ believes an announcement could come today or tomorrow. This has disappointed the markets. Last week, shares rose after it emerged that Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin was trying to organise fresh talks with Chinese officials over trade. Those negotiations now look fragile. So Asian indices are falling back into the red. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite has shed 1%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index is down 1.2%. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors are \u201chighly concerned\u201d about the Trump\u2019s upcoming decision. The president of the United States, Donald Trump is determined to put another $200 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods. There was some hope last week that the White House may be able to resolve this matter with Beijing in a more peaceful fashion. China has made one thing clear for Trump that threats and such behaviour aren\u2019t going to work with the country. Under the current circumstances, there are real chances that the new set of negotiations may never begin. So far, the Chinese government has declined to resume the trade talks because Trump is telling his aid to prepare for the next round of trade tariffs. This is the prime reason that we have seen the stocks tumbled over in Asia and the same momentum is highly likely to continue over in the Europe. Also coming up today The International Monetary Fund is releasing its latest assessment of the UK economy. IMF chief Christine Lagarde will speak in London this morning. New inflation figures are expected to confirm that prices in the eurozone rose by 2% in August. Argentina\u2019s economy minister is to present details of a new austerity budget to parliament. It\u2019s an attempt to shore up its IMF rescue package, and resist another plunge in the value of the peso.

As we noted last year, <strong>Brexit-related effects are the driving factor for the slowdown </strong>in growth since the referendum. This has occurred despite strong policy frameworks and implementation. Uncertainty about the future economic environment has weighed on investment, despite still robust global growth and easy financing conditions, while the post-referendum depreciation of sterling has depressed real income growth and consumption. While exports have picked up thanks to the weaker currency, they have not done so by enough to prevent an overall slowing of growth. Despite the more modest growth, however, employment continues to reach record levels, and the unemployment rate is near historic lows.</p> \n   <p>Our projections assume a timely agreement with the EU on a broad free trade pact and a relatively smooth Brexit process after that. A more disruptive departure will have a much worse outcome. Let me be clear: <strong>compared with today\u2019s smooth single market, all the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy </strong>, and to a lesser extent for the EU, as well. The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship, the costlier it will be. This should be obvious, but it seems that sometimes it is not.</p> \n   <p><strong>We should not understate the progress that has been achieved in the Brexit negotiations </strong>, most notably the tentative agreement on an implementation period. But many critical issues remain unresolved, most significantly a political agreement on the future economic relationship between the UK and the EU and the status of the Irish land border. We encourage both the UK and the EU to work diligently to reach agreement on these open issues to avoid a very costly cliff edge Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1041663699377897473\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Managing Director Christine Lagarde\u2019s opening remarks at the press conference for the UK Article 4 consultation in London today <a href=\"https://t.co/w4Li068xLb\">https://t.co/w4Li068xLb</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/3Z7jC6atCU\">pic.twitter.com/3Z7jC6atCU</a></p>\u2014 IMF (@IMFNews) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1041663699377897473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2018</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b9f9746e4b0f675819f2a70\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-17T12:02:03.321Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video: IMF chief Lagarde today</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The BBC have helpfully tweeted two video clips of Christine Lagarde speaking this morning.</strong></p> \n  <p>Here she is, explaining how all the possible Brexit scenarios have a cost for the UK economy, and Europe too.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1041625398386188288\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Christine Lagarde: \"All the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy, and to a lesser extent the EU\"<br><br>IMF chief warns no-deal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> carries greatest risk to UK economy <a href=\"https://t.co/qoZfwsMeLJ\">https://t.co/qoZfwsMeLJ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1EJW7Ju581\">pic.twitter.com/1EJW7Ju581</a></p>\u2014 BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1041625398386188288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2018</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And here\u2019s Lagarde on the specific negative consequences of a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1041634622239592448\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Christine Lagarde: No-deal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> would lead to \"reduced growth, increased deficit, depreciation of the currency\"<br><br>IMF chief warns of grave consequences if Britain leaves EU without a deal <a href=\"https://t.co/HKfrsQyRrF\">https://t.co/HKfrsQyRrF</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sWWd3Y8RHq\">pic.twitter.com/sWWd3Y8RHq</a></p>\u2014 BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1041634622239592448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 17, 2018</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-09-17T12:02:23.411Z\">at 1.02pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b9f947de4b0f675819f2a4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-17T12:00:03.328Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman has played down<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/sep/17/markets-trump-tariffs-china-imf-lagarde-uk-business-live?page=with:block-5b9f65b5e4b02292746e6067#block-5b9f65b5e4b02292746e6067\"> the IMF\u2019s claim</a> that a no-deal Brexit would be very costly for Britain.</strong></p> \n  <p>The Press Association has the details:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Chancellor Hammond said the report underlined the need for a Brexit deal to ensure the economic gains of the past decade were not lost. </p> \n   <p>\u201cWe are at a critical juncture for the UK economy.

Many of the required tasks cannot be initiated until there is greater clarity on the future trade relationship with the EU or even until Brexit occurs.</p> \n   <p>The massive scope of work that remains and the limited time before the UK exits the EU would likely leave preparations incomplete on departure day despite even the most determined efforts. This risks serious disruptions without an implementation period in place.

Three times-bankrupt Chappell, 51, was ordered to pay more than \u00a387,000, including a \u00a350,000 fine, after being found guilty in January of failing to provide information to the Pensions Regulator (TPR) about the firm\u2019s pensions schemes when it collapsed with the loss of thousands of jobs. Opening TPR\u2019s case at an appeal hearing at Hove crown court on Monday, the barrister Alex Stein said he did not want the proceedings to be hijacked by attempts to enter into evidence information that was irrelevant to the charges in question. He said: \u201cAn attempt to muddy the water and draw in irrelevant material [is] nothing more than a cynical attempt to rewrite history.\u201d Chappell, the director of Retail Acquisitions, bought British Home Stores for \u00a31 from the billionaire Sir Philip Green in March 2015. BHS went into administration in April 2016, leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green later agreed to pay \u00a3363m towards this. TPR investigated concerns about two pension schemes representing 19,000 members of staff. Stein said the crux of the prosecution\u2019s case was that Chappell failed to respond to three statutory notices demanding information. Chappell was issued with two notices known as section 72s under the Pensions Act 2004, in March and April 2016, before being handed a warning notice in November that year. The self-described entrepreneur, who lives near Blandford Forum in Dorset, claimed he did \u201ceverything and more\u201d to help the regulator. But he was prosecuted and found guilty of three charges after a four-day trial. Stein said: \u201cDespite the appellant [Chappell] confirming he received the final section 72 notice, there has never been any response to it whatsoever.\u201d Michael Levy, defending, told the court Chappell believed the notices had been responded to and he previously argued the task was impossible to complete in the timeframe given. Stein said it was important Chappell provided a reasonable excuse for failing to comply. He said there had been \u201cpromises of witnesses and evidence to support his case\u201d but none had materialised. Chappell said he was ill and travelling abroad during the period in question, claiming this prevented him from assisting investigators. But no medical evidence or travel logs had so far been provided, Stein added. He also told the court there was no evidence of Chappell being unable to access paperwork after claiming he was locked out of BHS offices when liquidators moved in. Chappell\u2019s defence team previously said three witnesses would be called to attest to his version of events in court, including his solicitor, Adrian Ring, who was present at the trial. This prompted claims Ring could have a conflict of interest in being called as a witness. On Monday Levy told the judge Christine Henson QC, who is overseeing the hearing with two magistrates, that no defence witnesses would be called during the proceedings. It is still unclear whether Chappell will be called to give evidence. The appeal continues on Monday afternoon and could last until Friday.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s ability to meet its emissions targets is being challenged by a comeback for coal power stations that threatens to drive up the energy sector\u2019s carbon emissions for the first time in six years. Coal plants have become more economic to run than their gas counterparts in the past month because wholesale gas prices have hit 10-year highs. A report by Imperial College London said the extra coal-burning had increased emissions by 15% in September, equivalent to an extra 1,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hour. If the trend continues in the coming months, the sector\u2019s emissions would rise by as much as 1.2 million tonnes this year, according to researchers at the university. The energy sector is the UK\u2019s second biggest emitter after transport. However, it has been the economy\u2019s standout success for cutting emissions in recent years because of the rapid growth in renewables and the phaseout of coal. A reversal of that success, even if only temporary, could pose a dilemma for ministers, who have to meet legally-binding carbon targets. The UK\u2019s carbon budgets, set by the Committee on Climate Change in order to meet the long-term goal of an 80% cut in emissions by 2050, dictate how much the country can emit over five-year periods. The UK is due to easily meet its third carbon budget, which runs from 2018-2023, but any prolonged rise in energy emissions would make future budgets harder to hit. Dr Iain Staffell, the author of the Imperial College London report, said: \u201cIf the only thing that has done well starts to backslide, I think that\u2019s going to be a real problem in meeting these [carbon] targets because they\u2019re just ratcheting up and getting more and more difficult.\u201d The recent increase in coal-burning is likely to continue this year because gas prices are usually higher in winter because of increased demand for heating. Analysts expect gas prices will stay high this winter. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good worry that we\u2019re looking at up to six months of coal being the cheapest source,\u201d Staffell said. Consumers are unlikely to benefit from coal being cheaper but coal operators would see their profits boosted this year, he said. The resurgence represents mixed news for EDF Energy, RWE and SSE as they all operate both coal and gas plants. However it will be good news for Germany\u2019s Uniper, which operates the Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal power plant in Nottinghamshire, and the energy group Drax, which commissioned the research by Imperial College London. While four of Drax\u2019s six units have converted to biomass, two still burn coal. The market intelligence firm ICIS said that it expected coal would account for 10.5% of electricity generation this winter, up from 10% last year. However, it warned that figure could go up significantly if there was a repeat of last winter\u2019s \u201dBeast from the east\u201d cold spell, or further outages at French nuclear power stations, which the UK relies on via links across the English Channel. \u201cIf similar capacity issues or a cold snap were to be seen again this winter, we could expect the forecast 10.5% share of coal to increase significantly,\u201d the group told the Guardian. Coal\u2019s comeback off high gas prices comes despite two coal power stations shutting later this month and EU carbon prices at 10-year highs. The UK has yet to say whether it will stay within the EU emissions trading system (ETS) when it leaves the EU but the energy industry has lobbied the government to stay in the scheme, which is the world\u2019s biggest carbon market. Even if the UK leaves the ETS, coal operators would still have to pay the UK\u2019s tax on dirty energy generators, called the carbon price floor, which has been frozen until 2025. The last time coal enjoyed the highs of recent weeks was the short-lived windfall for coal plant owners during the \u201cBeast from the East\u201d in February and March. During the cold snap, sudden and high demand for heating caused gas prices to surge, making coal power stations competitive against gas ones. However, coal remains on the way out in the UK. The government is committed to phasing out coal power by 2025 to meet its climate goals and the viability of most of the remaining plants rests on securing government subsidies to provide backup power at times of need.",

The asset management arm of the insurer Aviva is opposing Unilever\u2019s plans to move to a sole headquarters in Rotterdam and incorporate in the Netherlands under a single holding company. The proposed move means that Unilever, which makes consumer goods ranging from Marmite to Dove soap, will drop out of the FTSE 100 index, forcing UK tracker funds and those with strict UK investment mandates to sell their holdings. David Cumming, the chief investment officer for equities at Aviva Investors, said: \u201cWe are not supportive and we will vote against it. It doesn\u2019t add any value for us, we lose quite a large company from the index and we don\u2019t see any justification for the move. We would encourage other institutional shareholders to do the same as us.\u201d Cumming told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think they will struggle; I don\u2019t see logically why any UK shareholder would support Unilever\u2019s decision to go Dutch because there is no upside but there is downside \u2013 and we lose an excellent company from the index.\u201d Aviva Investors owns a 1.4% stake in Unilever. Iain Richards of Columbia Threadneedle Investments, another Unilever shareholder, said: \u201cWe continue to agree that restructuring Unilever makes sense but are still of the view that Unilever\u2019s approach discriminates against UK shareholders.\u201d For its proposals to pass, Unilever needs the backing of 75% of UK shareholders and 50% of Dutch investors, in separate votes in Rotterdam on 25 October and in London on 26 October. Unilever, which has had more than 150 investor meetings since it announced the plans in March, said: \u201cWe have engaged extensively with our shareholders and we believe the vast majority are fully supportive of the board\u2019s proposal.\u201d It argues that simplifying the company will make it easier to sell and buy assets and improve governance. It says 55% of its shareholders are based in the Netherlands and the shares listed in Amsterdam are more liquid. The planned relocation deals a big blow to the UK\u2019s status as a financial centre but Unilever insisted the proposals were not related to Brexit.

      "bodyText": "The new chief executive of Boohoo is in line for a \u00a350m bonus if shares in the online fashion retailer rise by 180% over the next five years. The fast-growing company has poached John Lyttle from Primark, where he was chief operating officer, and said its major shareholders had signed off on the incentive package. But the High Pay Centre, which monitors executive remuneration, said it was hard to justify rewards on such a scale, pointing to similar bonuses that have proved controversial this year at housebuilder Persimmon, gambling firm GVC and turnaround specialist Melrose. Under the bonus scheme, Lyttle will get \u00a350m on top of an annual salary and a bonus worth up to \u00a31.5m, if the company\u2019s share price increases by 180%, increasing the company\u2019s stockmarket value from about \u00a32bn to \u00a35.6bn. The incentive plan will not pay out anything until the company\u2019s market value rises by at least 60%, Boohoo said. The clock starts ticking on the award timeframe immediately, even though Lyttle will not actually take up the post until March. News of his appointment saw Boohoo shares rise by 2% to 173.45p. Luke Hildyard, a director of the High Pay Centre, said: \u201cThere has been widespread anger at executive pay awards that typically run to about \u00a34m or \u00a35m, so potential payments in the tens of millions are particularly controversial. \u201cCompanies who have used similar pay structures in the past, including Persimmon, Melrose and GVC Holdings, have attracted a lot of criticism from policymakers and investors. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of research that suggests huge pay awards don\u2019t really incentivise or motivate executives; executives are not necessarily the most important drivers of company performance and the vast differences in pay between business leaders and their workers negatively affects organisational morale.\u201d Persimmon chief executive Jeff Fairburn saw his bonus trimmed from \u00a3100m to \u00a375m amid investors\u2019 dismay at the scale of the payout, but even the reduced amount was described as \u201cunfathomable\u201d by the then housing minister Dominic Raab. A Boohoo spokesperson said the plan had been agreed with major shareholders of the company, whose largest investor is South African financial services group Old Mutual. The company, which is listed on the junior Aim stock market, has seen its sales jump by more than 50% in the three months to the end of May this year, compared with the same period last year. Its sales have risen 24-fold since 2011 to about \u00a3580m for the year ended in February, boosted by promotional deals with celebrities such as England and Tottenham Hotspur footballer Dele Alli. Boohoo\u2019s joint chiefs and co-founders Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane will both remain on the board of the company after Lyttle joins. Kamani and Kane founded the company in 2006, after working as wholesalers supplying chains such as Primark and Topshop. They added that they were convinced Lyttle has the \u201cnecessary skills to complement what we already have and take the group on to its next stage of growth\u201d. Pay awards linked to share price rises have attracted criticism this year, after they resulted in huge bonuses.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK economy would rapidly start to contract in the event of a disruptive exit from the EU next spring, according to a stark International Monetary Fund report that highlights the recession risks of a no-deal Brexit. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, added that there would be costs to the UK under any outcome that involves leaving the EU. Expressing the IMF\u2019s growing concern at the possibility of an acrimonious divorce next March, Lagarde said: \u201cIf that happened there would be dire consequences. It would inevitably have consequences in terms of reduced growth, an increase in the [budget] deficit and a depreciation of the currency. \u201cIn relatively short order it would mean a reduction in the size of the economy.\u201d Lagarde said the IMF\u2019s forecast of 1.5% growth next year was based on a smooth exit from the EU. Her remarks were seized upon by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as evidence that the UK had to strike a deal that would safeguard jobs and prosperity. \u201cAs the IMF has said, no deal would be extremely costly for the UK as it would be for the EU,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cDespite contingency planning, it would put at risk the significant progress made over the past 10 years in repairing the economy.\u201d No 10, however, pointedly refused to endorse Hammond\u2019s gloomy predictions. When asked about what he had said, her spokesman referred to what Theresa May told the BBC in an interview broadcast earlier: \u201cThe PM said very clearly that she believes our best days are ahead of us and that we will have plans in place for us to succeed in all scenarios.\u201d The IMF\u2019s warning came in the preliminary findings of its annual health check of the UK economy. The Washington-based organisation, which monitors the global economy and lends to troubled countries, will flesh out precise details of the size of a UK recession in the event of a disorderly Brexit when it publishes the final report in November. Speaking at a press conference at the Treasury, Lagarde took issue with Brexit supporters who have said the UK would thrive if it left the EU without a deal and then traded on World Trade Organization terms. \u201cOur projections assume a timely agreement with the EU on a broad free-trade pact and a relatively smooth Brexit process after that. A more disruptive departure will have a much worse outcome. Let me be clear: compared with today\u2019s smooth single market, all the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy, and to a lesser extent for the EU as well. The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship, the costlier it will be. This should be obvious but it seems that sometimes it is not.\u201d The IMF came in for criticism from pro-leavers after giving a number of warnings about the consequences of Brexit in advance of the EU referendum in June 2016. The pro-Brexit economist Patrick Minford, whose work is used by the European Research Group of Conservative MPs fighting against the prime minister\u2019s Chequers plan, said the IMF had used the \u201cwrong assumptions\u201d about a no-deal scenario. \u201cOur trade with the EU will continue largely unimpeded. Also free trade with the rest of the world will boost our productivity and lower prices,\u201d he said. Lagarde said the impact of the vote had been to slow the economy, adding that it would have been better had the passion surrounding the Brexit debate been devoted to curing the UK\u2019s productivity deficit with other leading economies. Asked if she saw anything positive coming out of Brexit, Lagarde said: \u201cI see a lot of negatives. If all the uncertainties were removed it would be better. It is bad for the economy to have this amount of uncertainty.\u201d The IMF\u2019s latest contribution to the Brexit debate came at a time when May has been battling leading Eurosceptics over her Chequers proposals, warning that her plan for a deal with Brussels is the only option. She told the BBC on Monday it was either her deal or no deal. Lagarde said progress had been made in preparing the UK for life outside the EU. \u201cNevertheless, the range of issues that remains to be addressed is daunting and the time left to accomplish them may be very short.\u201d Ideally, she added, the transition period would be longer than the 20 months agreed between London and Brussels. The IMF said UK growth has already dropped and business investment has been lower than would be expected since the EU referendum two years ago. Over time, new trade agreements with countries outside the EU could eventually reduce some of the losses for the UK, it said, adding: \u201cHowever, such agreements are unlikely to bring sufficient benefits to offset the costs imposed by leaving the EU.\u201d",
