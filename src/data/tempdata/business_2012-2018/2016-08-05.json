      "bodyText": "BP has quietly announced the planned location of its controversial drilling in the Great Australian Bight, and the two sites fall within the Commonwealth Marine Reserve. Despite being the subject of a Senate inquiry, and having its application to drill knocked back twice by the regulator NOPSEMA, BP had so far never released the precise location of its exploratory drilling wells in the pristine Great Australian Bight. In a document released by BP entitled \u201cUpdate on regulatory approvals\u201d, the company included a small map showing the location of the planned wells. The map doesn\u2019t indicate the location of the marine reserves but, when overlaid with the reserve maps, the wells could be seen to fall within them. According to the Department of Environment, that particular area was inscribed in the reserve system for a range of reasons including being a \u201cglobally important seasonal calving habitat for the threatened southern right whale\u201d and important foraging areas for sea lions, white sharks and sperm whales. The section of the marine park that BP wants to drill in is listed as a \u201cmultiple use zone\u201d, which allows for mining, oil and gas activities. According to analysis by the Wilderness Society, 47% of BP\u2019s exploration leases were outside the marine reserves. A spokeswoman for BP said they believed the oil industry could safely coexist with the marine environment. \u201cWe have assessed potential environmental issues from exploration activities in the Great Australian Bight and in turn incorporated this into our planning.\u201d Peter Owen, the Australian director for the Wilderness Society, disagreed. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that BP has only finally quietly revealed where it plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight two years after being asked and after two failed applications to drill have been lodged,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe BP realised that the public may be shocked that BP wants to conduct exploration drilling in the most biologically important part of the Great Australian Bight, the Commonwealth Marine Reserve, which was designed to protect the Bight\u2019s extraordinary marine life.\u201d In 2010, BP was responsible for the world\u2019s largest oils spill \u2013 the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 which occurred in calmer and more shallow waters than those in the bight. Modelling of a potential oil spill in the Great Australian Bight, commissioned by the Wilderness Society in 2015, showed it could affect most of Australia\u2019s southern coastline, shutting down fisheries and threatening wildlife including whales, seabirds and sea lions. The Great Australian Bight Commonwealth Marine Park was created in 2005 and extended in 2012 to become part of the Great Australian Bight Commonwealth Marine Reserve. When the Abbott government was elected, they began a \u201creview\u201d of the marine parks, which suspended the implementation of their management, making the parks mostly meaningless.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has cut its lending rates for homebuyers, leaving Lloyds Banking Group as the last major lender holding out against the Bank of England\u2019s call to pass on Thursday\u2019s interest rate cut to borrowers. The sudden announcement by RBS came on Friday just hours after the bank, which is 73% owned by the taxpayer, had insisted that a decision would not be made immediately to reduce its standard variable rate (SVR) from 4%. When the Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% on Thursday to counter a downturn in the economy after the Brexit vote, its governor, Mark Carney, told bankers there would be no excuses for not passing on the rate to customers. The RBS cut took its SVR to 3.75% and will also affect NatWest customers. It came as Lloyds, which is 9% owned by the taxpayer, said it was still reviewing its 3.99% SVR on Friday, but that it had already passed on the cut to those who had products which tracked the base rate. The other government-backed lender, UK Asset Resolution, which owns some Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgages approved before the credit crunch, also cut its SVR, while HSBC announced earlier on Friday it would reduce its to 3.69%. Many borrowers have moved to fixed rates or have loans that track the base rate, but nearly a third of mortgage customers \u2013 2.2 million people \u2013 are on a lender\u2019s SVR. Some customers are left on theses rates because they are unable to shift their loan to more competitive providers because of blemished credit histories or a fall in their value of the property. Lenders tend to have discretion over raising or lowering their SVRs. The mortgage lender Kent Reliance has the highest at 6.08%, and other lenders charge SVR customers more than 5.5%. David Hollingworth, of broker L&amp;C Mortgages, said: \u201cMore should be done to help borrowers move between lenders as well as ensure they have options with their current lender and are not left to sit on a high SVR because the lender knows they can\u2019t move. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that not all borrowers are paying SVR purely through apathy and have seen their options curtailed by tighter [lending] criteria in recent years.\u201d Hollingworth calculated that monthly payments on a typical \u00a3150,000 repayment mortgage are \u00a3792 at a 4% rate, while the same mortgage at 6.08% would cost \u00a3974 a month. A customer with a two-year fixed rate at 0.99% would pay just \u00a3564 month \u2013 a huge saving and a big boost to family spending power. Ray Boulger, of the independent mortgage brokers John Charcol, said passing on rate cuts in full should be a requirement for banks taking part in a newly announced funding scheme, which was also announced by the Bank of England on Thursday. The new \u201cterm funding scheme\u201d (TFS) could provide up to \u00a3100bn of new funding to banks but will charge them a penalty rate if they do not lend out the fresh funds. Carney told lenders the scheme had been designed to relieve the pain on profits that banks would take as interest rates fell. Low interest rates are problematic for banks because they narrow the gap between what they pay to savers and charge to lenders. RBS sparked controversy last week by writing to 1.3 million small-business customers to warn them it might want to charge them for making deposits if interest rates turned negative. McEwan said he did not expect this to happen, despite sending out the letters. Carney insisted on Thursday that he was not a fan of negative rates. This view was backed by one of his deputies, Ben Broadbent, who told Reuters the TFS scheme would not be a backdoor way to introduce negative interest rates directly to banks without a cut to the headline rate. Broadbent said: \u201cThere are limits for us, too. We would not want to offer that finance at hugely negative interest rates, because we would be making losses ourselves. There are limits to what monetary policy \u2013 indeed any demand management policy \u2013 conventional fiscal policy as well, to offset what is a structural effect on the economy.\u201d RBS also revealed on Friday that it had incurred losses of \u00a32bn in the first half of 2016.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has slumped to a \u00a32bn half-year loss after taking a fresh hit for legal disputes, as it admitted costs will have to be cut to tackle the economic impact of the Brexit vote and the dwindling popularity of high street branches. The bank, which is 73% owned by the taxpayer and is on track for its ninth consecutive year of losses, is also abandoning its long-running attempts to float the Williams &amp; Glyn branch network - a move the EU demanded as part of the bank\u2019s \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout and a key plank of the government\u2019s plans to bolster competition on the high street. Its shares were the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 after \u00a31.3bn of new charges, including \u00a3450m for PPI, surprised the City. A year ago, the government used the half-year results to sell off its first tranche of shares at 330p a share. On Friday, they closed at 178p, down 7% and well below average price of 502p at which taxpayers bought their shares during the financial crisis. The provisions also include an investigation into tracker mortgages at Ulster Bank and an estimated \u00a3700m for a legal case brought by shareholders who backed a 200p a share cash call in 2008, ahead of the taxpayer bailout. An attempt to settle the shareholder case in mediation talks on 26 and 27 July had not reached a conclusion, the bank said, leaving open the door to a long-running court case in which RBS\u2019s former chief executive Fred Goodwin could be called to give evidence. The bank\u2019s losses have now hit \u00a352bn since its bailout and Ross McEwan, its chief executive, admitted the share price slide meant a further sale of the taxpayer stake was looking more difficult. He appeared to clear the way for job cuts and branch closures as he outlined customers\u2019 increasing use of digital banking. The Bank of England\u2019s interest rate cut to 0.25% also led analysts to question his targets to cut costs. He told them his executive team was working on a plan that would be announced next year \u201cfor a lower cost base for this organisation\u201d. McEwan defended the way the bank had handled the EU\u2019s demand to create a new branch network of 300 branches \u2013 dubbed Williams &amp; Glyn \u2013 to create a new competitor on the high street. The long-running process is already delayed and has cost \u00a31.5bn so far. A trade sale is now being pursued and Santander - which pulled out of a deal in in 2012 - is thought to have tabled an offer for the operation, which focuses on small businesses and employs 5,500 people. To be a viable standalone business, Williams &amp; Glyn needs a banking licence from Bank of England, but the low interest rate environment would make it difficult for the operation to be profitable, RBS said. Brexit was not entirely to blame for this, it added, because expectations that interest rates would stay low had been mounting before the 23 June referendum. The abandonment of the flotation means RBS is likely to hand millions of pounds to the private equity consortium which had been backing the share offering. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said the costs of W&amp;G would mount. \u201cThis is likely to result in even more exceptional charges, which we think could run into the hundreds of millions of pounds,\u201d he said. The branches are valued at around \u00a31.3bn, but they are onlylikely to fetch around two-thirds of that price if sold to a rival. RBS\u2019s finance director, Ewen Stevenson, said the banking industry was facing a hit to profits as result of the low interest rate environment. He focused on the \u00a31bn of profits being generated at its core business every quarter, which would eventually allow the bank to pay dividends to shareholders. The first payments, thhowever, are not expected until 2018 at the earliest",

A year ago, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/uk-government-starts-royal-bank-of-scotland-sell-off-rbs\">used the half-year results to sell off</a> its first tranche of shares at 330p a share. On Friday, they closed at 178p, down 7% and well below average price of 502p at which taxpayers bought their shares during the financial crisis.</p> <p>The provisions also include an investigation into tracker mortgages at Ulster Bank and an estimated \u00a3700m for a legal case brought by shareholders who backed a 200p a share cash call in 2008, ahead of the taxpayer bailout.<br></p> <p>An attempt to settle the shareholder case in mediation talks on 26 and 27 July had not reached a conclusion, the bank said, leaving open the door to a long-running court case in which RBS\u2019s former chief executive Fred Goodwin could be called to give evidence. </p> <p>The bank\u2019s losses have now hit \u00a352bn since its bailout and Ross McEwan, its chief executive, admitted the share price slide meant a further sale of the taxpayer stake was looking more difficult.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a958f0375c6429a40cd4cd8cd32880af06c9014\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a958f0375c6429a40cd4cd8cd32880af06c9014/380_73_2498_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross McEwan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ross McEwan has poured cold water on further sale of taxpayer-owned shares.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He appeared to clear the way for job cuts and branch closures as he outlined customers\u2019 increasing use of digital banking. The Bank of England\u2019s interest rate cut to 0.25% also led analysts to question his targets to cut costs. He told them his executive team was working on a plan that would be announced next year \u201cfor a lower cost base for this organisation\u201d.</p> <p>McEwan defended the way the bank had handled the EU\u2019s demand to create a new branch network of 300 branches \u2013 dubbed Williams &amp; Glyn \u2013 to create a new competitor on the high street. The long-running process is already delayed and has cost \u00a31.5bn so far. A trade sale is now being pursued and Santander - <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2012/oct/12/rbs-branch-sale-santander-falls-through\">which pulled out of a deal in in 2012</a> - is thought to have tabled an offer for the operation, which focuses on small businesses and employs 5,500 people.</p> <p>To be a viable standalone business, Williams &amp; Glyn needs a banking licence from Bank of England, but the low interest rate environment would make it difficult for the operation to be profitable, RBS said. Brexit was not entirely to blame for this, it added, because expectations that interest rates would stay low had been mounting before the 23 June referendum.</p> <p>The abandonment of the flotation means RBS is likely to hand millions of pounds to the private equity consortium which had been backing the share offering. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said the costs of W&amp;G would mount. \u201cThis is likely to result in even more exceptional charges, which we think could run into the hundreds of millions of pounds,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The branches are valued at around \u00a31.3bn, but they are onlylikely to fetch around two-thirds of that price if sold to a rival.</p> <p>RBS\u2019s finance director, Ewen Stevenson, said the banking industry was facing a hit to profits as result of the low interest rate environment. He focused on the \u00a31bn of profits being generated at its core business every quarter, which would eventually allow the bank to pay dividends to shareholders. The first payments, thhowever, are not expected until 2018 at the earliest</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Mark Carney unveiled a broad package of measures to ward off a post-EU referendum recession on Thursday, he emphasised that the Bank of England had only limited power to shore up the economy. The government will have to play its part too, the Bank\u2019s governor said. All eyes are now on the Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement due later this year. The new chancellor has already told Carney that the government will \u201ctake any necessary steps\u201d [pdf] and come up with its own measures. There are a number of things the government will be considering. Tax cuts There have been calls for a cut to the VAT rate from 20% to fire up consumer spending, which is the main driver of the UK\u2019s economic growth. The government, however, will want to see more surveys and official data on how spending has held up since the referendum before it decides to take a hit to its already squeezed public coffers. The former chancellor George Osborne has said cuts to business taxes are needed in response to the Brexit vote. Before he was replaced by Hammond, Osborne said the government should get on with cutting corporation tax to below 15% in a bid to encourage businesses to invest in Britain outside the EU. His successor will be wary of cutting without more evidence that companies are shunning the UK, and given that the prime minister, Theresa May, has talked about reforming capitalism so the system works \u201cfor everyone, not just the privileged few\u201d, a cut to business taxes is probably not be the message she wants her new chancellor to send. More infrastructure spending Businesses are urging the government to spend more on infrastructure such as roads and rail links. They argue that record low interest rates make this a good time for it to borrow money to invest. The spending would get money flowing through the economy, create jobs and the projects would yield long-term economic gains. Delaying the planned apprenticeship levy Disgruntled business lobby groups have already labelled Osborne\u2019s plans to introduce a near-\u00a33bn levy on bigger firms next April a \u201cpayroll tax\u201d. Now that the vote to leave the EU has hit business sentiment and demand, there are calls for it to be delayed. Hammond could agree to this to appease business leaders and boost confidence. Boosting productivity If the new chancellor does delay the apprenticeship levy he will have to come up with other ways to tackle Britain\u2019s skills shortages in areas such as construction and IT, and so help raise the country\u2019s productivity out of the doldrums. The government has committed to boosting apprenticeship numbers and creating 3m new apprentices by 2020. If May is serious about tackling inequality she will have to show that her government can provide routes into decent careers beyond university degrees. The UK lags behind other advanced economies on productivity, a measure of what is produced by employees per hour worked. Carney said boosting productivity was key to raising the UK\u2019s economic prospects, but experts say it could be years before the UK sees the gains of any measures to boost productivity, such as investment in innovation, education and infrastructure. Reduce planned rises to the national living wage The \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 for over-25s was introduced in April, and the government has committed to increasing it each year. With economic prospects looking bleaker after the Brexit vote, however, some employers say such rises will be less affordable. They want the low pay commission, the independent body that advises the government on minimum wages, to recommend only a small rise in April 2017. Here again, May\u2019s government will be cautious about being seen to penalise the low-paid, given her pledge to raise living standards. Anti-poverty campaigners also argue that low pay is a significant part of the UK\u2019s productivity problem and that only higher pay thresholds will make firms improve management, training and overall efficiency. Helicopter money Carney has questioned the effectiveness of so-called \u201chelicopter money\u201d schemes, under which a central bank prints cash so that finance ministries can hand it out to citizens or spend it on big infrastructure projects. With the government under pressure to boost spending on infrastructure, however, and both Hammond and Carney vowing they have more tools to help the economy, some sort of unconventional scheme along these lines could still become a reality. One option would be for the Treasury to issue new infrastructure bonds for public investment projects. The Bank would then buy the bonds using newly created money, so financing the projects. Trade deals The biggest task for May\u2019s government will be negotiating new trade deals. Any action taken by the Bank of England or the Treasury will have only limited impact as long as the UK\u2019s trading relationships with the EU and the rest of the world drift into an uncertain future.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Nissan has warned that future investment decisions about the company\u2019s car plant in the north-east of England will depend on the outcome of Brexit negotiations. Carlos Ghosn said he was reasonably optimistic that common sense would prevail and the UK would remain a key partner of the EU. The boss of Nissan, which employs 6,700 car workers at the plant in Sunderland, was speaking 24 hours after new car sales figures showed previous strong growth had come to an abrupt halt in July amid uncertainty after the EU referendum. Ghosn said most companies would want to see what was going to happen in trade and other talks between Britain and the EU before making decisions about investment in Sunderland. \u201cWell I don\u2019t think today you can talk about any impact before we see what is the new status of the UK. The question of Sunderland \u2026 Sunderland is a plant which is a European plant based in the UK,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cMost of the production out of Sunderland is exported to Europe. So obviously for us the relationship which is going to prevail between the UK and Europe is very important \u2026 So you\u2019re going to see a period where most companies are going to be waiting to see what\u2019s going to be the new status.\u201d Ghosn was speaking from Brazil, where his company is a key sponsor of the Olympic Games. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re reasonably optimistic that at the end of the day common sense is going to prevail from both sides \u2026 [that the] UK will still continue to be a big partner of the European community.\u201d Nissan, like other British car manufacturers, had argued strongly for Britain to remain in the EU. However, Sunderland had one of the highest votes in favour of leaving \u2013 six out of 10 people. Car manufacturing in the north-east and in other parts of the UK has been highly successful over the past decade due to heavy investment by a series of mainly foreign companies including Japan\u2019s Toyota, India\u2019s Tata (Jaguar Land Rover) and Germany\u2019s BMW (Mini). But there are fears that many of these firms, such as Nissan, could retreat if access to the EU is in any way restricted. A spokesman for the North East Chamber of Commerce said the government must ensure that local employers do not miss out as a result of any new post-Brexit trading arrangements. \u201cNissan is a huge player in the region and makes up a huge part of our exports and we need to see long-term investor confidence in the north-east and to be seen as a desirable location for exporters,\u201d the spokesman said. Paul Watson, leader of Sunderland city council, said it was good to hear Ghosn was cautiously optimistic but added he had concerns manufacturing in the north-east would not be a priority compared to the City of London during Brexit negotiations.",

So obviously for us the relationship which is going to prevail between the UK and Europe is very important \u2026 So you\u2019re going to see a period where most companies are going to be waiting to see what\u2019s going to be the new status.\u201d</p> <p>Ghosn was speaking from Brazil, where his company is a key sponsor of the Olympic Games. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re reasonably optimistic that at the end of the day common sense is going to prevail from both sides \u2026 [that the] UK will still continue to be a big partner of the European community.\u201d</p> <p>Nissan, like other British car manufacturers, had argued strongly for Britain to remain in the EU. However, Sunderland had one of the highest votes in favour of leaving \u2013 six out of 10 people.</p> <p>Car manufacturing in the north-east and in other parts of the UK has been highly successful over the past decade due to heavy investment by a series of mainly foreign companies including Japan\u2019s Toyota, India\u2019s Tata (Jaguar Land Rover) and Germany\u2019s BMW (Mini). But there are fears that many of these firms, such as Nissan, could retreat if access to the EU is in any way restricted. </p> <p>A spokesman for the <a href=\"http://nechamber.org/\">North East Chamber of Commerce</a> said the government must ensure that local employers do not miss out as a result of any new post-Brexit trading arrangements. \u201cNissan is a huge player in the region and makes up a huge part of our exports and we need to see long-term investor confidence in the north-east and to be seen as a desirable location for exporters,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>Paul Watson, leader of Sunderland city council, said it was good to hear Ghosn was cautiously optimistic but added he had concerns manufacturing in the north-east would not be a priority compared to the City of London during Brexit negotiations.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct shareholders will vote on a resolution calling for an independent review of the retailer\u2019s treatment of employees following the Guardian\u2019s exposure of working practices at the company. The notice of Sports Direct\u2019s annual general meeting lists a resolution brought by the Unite trade union calling on the board to commission an investigation to report back within six months. Sports Direct\u2019s board urged shareholders to vote against the resolution, but Unite has met several fund managers and pension funds seeking support for its proposal. City sources have said it is likely to get significant backing at the AGM, which will be held at the retailer\u2019s head office in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, on 7 September. In a supporting statement sent to shareholders, Unite said Sports Direct had suffered a crisis of confidence caused partly by its treatment of workers. The union said the review must consider whether the company should pay the voluntary living wage of \u00a38.25 an hour and replace zero-hour and agency worker contracts with permanent contracts. Campaigners at ShareAction, which has been pushing Sports Direct to act on pay, backed Unite\u2019s call for independent oversight. Lisa Nathan, the group\u2019s campaigns manager, said: \u201cThis resolution is a crucial opportunity for investors to challenge the board of Sports Direct about its appalling employment practices. \u201cThe damning reports about Sports Direct\u2019s behaviour make for shocking headlines \u2013 but they also represent clear financial risks to the company. Its reputation has already been seriously damaged, and operations and governance failures can also have an impact on share price. \u201cThe role of investors is to hold companies to account. Investors in Sports Direct should ask themselves whether an independent review would help to address these concerns, and if so then they should support the resolution.\u201d In December, a Guardian investigation revealed that Sports Direct effectively paid below the minimum wage by subjecting employees at its giant warehouse at Shirebrook to lengthy searches at the end of their shifts. Shirebrook employees, most of whom were hired from agencies, were also harangued over a PA system for not working hard enough and threatened with the sack for offences such as taking time off sick and long toilet breaks. In a report published last month, MPs said Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s billionaire founder, ran the company like a Victorian workhouse. Ashley admitted to the House of Commons\u2019 business committee in June that conditions at Shirebrook were unacceptable, and that HMRC was investigating the company over its failure to pay some staff the minimum wage. Ashley started his own review of working practices in December last year and has since appointed a law firm, RPC, to compile a report based on his findings. Unite does not believe RPC is sufficiently independent because it has acted for Ashley on several occasions. \u201cThe review should be carried out by an individual or organisation that is independent of the company and has no financial, commercial or personal relationship with any board member. This individual or organisation \u2026 should be acceptable to Sports Direct workers and their representatives,\u201d Unite said. In the AGM notice, Sports Direct\u2019s board said a new investigation would duplicate its existing review and be an unnecessary distraction. It said Ashley had already promised to talk to Unite, and that the the company had either addressed the union\u2019s proposals or would include them in the existing review. A Sports Direct spokesman was not immediately available for comment. The vote on workers\u2019 pay comes as Sports Direct\u2019s annual report revealed that its chief executive, Dave Forsey, would not be given a pay rise this year \u2013 for the 14th year in a row. Forsey earns a basic salary of \u00a3150,000 a year, but is also part of share bonus schemes that target all permanent staff. In June, in the wake of the scandal over workers\u2019 pay, Sports Direct said Forsey would forgo a \u00a34m share bonus from a 2011 scheme due to pay out next summer. Forsey and 3,000 other permanent staff will also miss out on the latest three-year bonus scheme, which was launched last year, because the company failed to meet its first annual profit target. Sports Direct has said it is working on a new scheme to replace it. The company\u2019s board also has the power to introduce an annual bonus for directors this year, but said it had opted not to do so. Sports Direct shareholders have become increasingly concerned about how the company is run following the Guardian\u2019s revelations and worsening trading at the company. Unite said the halving of Sports Direct\u2019s share price in the five months following last September\u2019s AGM demonstrated the company was in crisis. The shares have fallen further since and are now down about 60% since the 2015 AGM. \u201cThis significant drop in share price calls into question the board\u2019s efforts to address the lack of confidence in the company \u2026 We believe that the current business plan does not represent a strategy for generating long-term, sustainable value,\u201d Unite said.",

      "bodyText": "A busy week for economic and business news has been capped off with brighter figures from the US, where a forecast-busting 255,000 jobs were added in July. A pick-up in wage growth and jobs gains for June that were stronger previously thought helped raise hopes that the world\u2019s biggest economy is strengthening, putting the prospect of a September interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve back on the table. Before we go, here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s main news: The US economy added 255,000 jobs in July, beating economists\u2019 expectations for growth of 180,000 Wall Street has opened higher after those jobs numbers. The Nasdaq is up 1%, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.7% The optimism has spread to Europe, where the FTSE 100 is up 0.7%, having briefly broken through the 6,800 mark and set a new high for this year. The FTSE 250 index of midcaps is similarly at new highs for 2016, up 1.3% to 17,462 France\u2019s CAC40 share index is up 1.4%, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.1% The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Ben Broadbent has defended a rate cut to 0.25% and other measures unveiled on Thursday to ward off a post referendum recession Commercial banks, told by the Bank of England governor Mark Carney they have no excuse not to pass on the base rate cut, appear to be acceding to his call. However, Lloyds, the country\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, is still considering how to proceed Royal Bank of Scotland, the 73%-taxpayer-owned bank, has slumped to a \u00a32bn half-year loss The chief executive of Nissan has warned that future investment decisions about the company\u2019s car plant in the north-east of England will depend on the outcome of Brexit negotiations. With that, we are closing the live blog for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. We\u2019ll be back on Monday with more rolling coverage of business and economics news. The will-they-won\u2019t-they debate over a September interest rate hike from the US Federal Reserve has hotted up in the wake of these stronger than expected payrolls numbers. In stark contrast to the UK, where rates were cut to a new record low on Thursday and more cuts are expected, the US central bank could be raising as soon as next month. But some analysts see plenty of reasons for the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hold off until after November\u2019s presidential election. Ken Odeluga, analyst at City Index says all eyes will now be on a speech from Fed chair Janet Yellen later this month: \u201cHeadline U.S. payrolls which beat expectations by about 40%, and jobs market growth that\u2019s showing signs of bursting at the seams, obviously swing the onus back on to Janet Yellen\u2019s Federal Reserve... Federal funds futures had all but priced out another rate hike this year before Friday, but chances are rising that the latest data will encourage Yellen to signal a rate rise as early as September. \u201cWith no Fed meeting this month, the Fed chair\u2019s speech at this year\u2019s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, between 25th-27th August, will be scrutinised closely.\u201d But markets should interpret anything she says with care. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, highlights the market\u2019s uneasy relationship with the Fed after previous unrealised hints of action: \u201cFOMC watchers could be forgiven for thinking the committee has taken a \u201chead in the sand\u201d approach to the US labour market. After saying for years that rates would rise if the labour market continued to improve, the FOMC appears to be holding fire on rate hikes, and as a result markets are very sceptical about the prospects of even today\u2019s strong figures leading to further tightening in the near future. However, complacency can lead to volatility and if the FOMC does finally act in September, the resulting correction in fixed income, commodities and currencies could make for an interesting autumn.\u201d David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers expects a Fed move in December. He comments: \u201cAnother solid payrolls continues to suggest a firmer underlying GDP expansion than recorded in Q2 GDP. This is consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s latest guidance that \u201cnear-term risks \u2026 diminished\u201d. We expect Q3 GDP to record a solid rebound to Q2\u2019s inventory-correction impacted growth. We think this will increase the Fed\u2019s confidence to tighten policy. We consider this unlikely before November\u2019s elections (although we expect the probability of a September hike to grow in market\u2019s minds). We forecast a 0.25% December hike.\u201d One part of the US jobs report that confounded expectations to the downside was the unemployment rate. That held steady in July at 4.9%, missing expectations among economists for it to drop to 4.8%. The unchanged unemployment rate, despite a pick up in new jobs, is explained by a rise in the number of people entering the labour market looking for work. Here are those US jobs numbers in context: Wall Street has opened higher, as expected, after those stronger-than-expected US jobs numbers. Following government data showing 255,000 jobs were added in July, the market feels the outlook for the US economy has brightened and stocks and the dollar are higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8%, the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.3% and the Nasdaq is up around 0.5%. In the UK, the effects of a weak pound against the dollar continue to be felt on the FTSE 100. The index, where a significant number of component companies earn revenues in dollars, has hit its highest level since July 2015. Adding to gains made on the back of Thursday\u2019s UK interest rate cut, the bluechip index now stands at 6,799.9. That\u2019s up around 60 points, or 0.9%, on the day. Economists at S&amp;P Global Ratings highlight the rise in the average work week in the US, the pick-up in average hourly earnings and the cumulative solid growth in new jobs in June and July. It\u2019s a welcome boost after a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of corporate earnings these past several days, they say. But they do not see the US central bank acting before November\u2019s presidential election. Beth Ann Bovino and Satyam Panday continue: \u201cA steady pace of hiring, healthier consumer appetites and a bounce in producer sentiment paint a brighter US economic outlook amidst ongoing global woes. A solid August jobs report should allow Federal Reserve officials to breathe a little easier when they meet in September and keep them on track for an interest rate hike likely after the US elections in December.\u201d Wall Street futures are pointing to a strong open for US stocks after those much stronger-than-expected non-farm payrolls numbers. The signs of strength in the US economy and prospect of a rate rise there as soon as next month have also boosted the dollar. That means the pound is down sharply against the US currency. The pound had already weakened markedly on Thursday on the Bank of England\u2019s interest cut and other stimulus measures. It recovered some ground on Friday morning only to now fall back. The pound is currently down 0.5% on the day against the dollar at $1.3045. It stood at $1.3160 before the payrolls data. David Cheetham, analyst at the currency brokerage XTB.com comments: \u201cThe immediate reaction in the markets has seen the GBP-USD drop sharply below yesterday\u2019s low, gold and yields on US government debt both decline whilst US stock futures rallied. Taken together with yesterday\u2019s strong stimulus measure from the BoE the macroeconomic backdrop is now far more rosy than it was immediately post-Brexit and fresh yearly highs for the S&amp;P500 and FTSE could be just around the corner.\u201d Here is the key data on US wages in July. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says: In July, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 8 cents to $25.69. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.6%. That and the jobs growth has led some to pencil in a rate rise in the US in September. But James Knightley, economist at ING, says there are still plenty of reasons why Janet Yellen and her Fed colleagues will hold off for a while. He highlights political uncertainty, mixed data and external risks: \u201cThe outcome of today\u2019s report is supportive of the view that we could see a rate hike before year-end - we have had a couple of Fed officials this week suggest that this is possible. It also backs up the assessment within the latest FOMC statement that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished\u201d. Nonetheless, we have our doubts it will happen given the mixed nature of the US data flow and political uncertainty relating to the election, while external risks remain a possible constraint. \u201cAdditionally, with the RBA in Australia and the Bank of England providing more monetary stimulus and Japan boosting its fiscal stimulus we think a majority of Fed officials will be nervous about raising rates given the significant boost it could give the dollar. Instead, we think they will continue to tread cautiously with one rate hike in the first quarter of 2017 and a further one in the second half of next year.\u201d Those payroll numbers were much better than forecast in the market and accompanying news of a pick up in wages will bolster expectations of an interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve in the months ahead. Reactions so far to the news that the US economy added 255,000 jobs in July and more jobs than previously thought in June: My colleague Jana Kasperkevic in New York reports that the positive figures come after the labour market stumbled in May, adding only 11,000 jobs. Hiring rebounded in June with a net gain of 287,000, but recent economic figures and a faltering European economy had suggested another slowdown. Here is her full news story: In a big upside surprise, the US economy has added 255,000 new jobs in July, according to government data. The forecast was for a July gain of 180,000 jobs. The June rise in jobs was also revised higher today, now seen at 292,000 additional jobs compared with the previous estimate of 287,000. The US unemployment rate was 4.9% in July. With just a few minutes to go to this month\u2019s jobs report from the US, here\u2019s a quick reminder of what markets expect. The government\u2019s US non-farm payrolls figures for July are expected to show a gain of around 180,000, down from June\u2019s bumper 287,000, but above the three-month average of 148,000. The jobless rate is forecast to fall to 4.8%. That\u2019s according to a Reuters poll of economists. And here\u2019s what Twitter thinks: Ben Broadbent, who this morning defended the Bank\u2019s four-pronged stimulus package, told Reuters that as well as cutting rates further the Bank still has more measures up its sleeve to support the economy. He also discussed the Bank\u2019s new Term Funding Scheme (TFS), which will provide loans to commercial banks at low rates to ensure they pass on this week\u2019s base rate cut. The deputy governor rebuffed any suggestion the Bank of England would use the scheme as a a back-door way to introduce negative interest rates - something governor Mark Carney has opposed. Broadbent told Reuters: \u201cThere are limits for us too. We would not want to offer that finance at hugely negative interest rates, because we would be making losses ourselves.\u201d He also echoed Carney and others in noting that monetary policy could not completely offset the likely blow from the decision to leave the EU. \u201cThere are limits to what monetary policy - indeed any demand management policy - conventional fiscal policy as well, to offset what is a structural effect on the economy,\u201d he said. The full report from Reuters is here. And if you want to know more about the ins and outs of the Bank\u2019s new stimulus package, it\u2019s broken out the key points here: The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Ben Broadbent has been back out talking to the press after yesterday\u2019s kitchen sink package to avert a post-referendum recession. In an interview with Reuters, Broadbent says he is likely to vote for another rate cut unless economic growth beats expectations. That echoes the tone of yesterday\u2019s minutes from the latest Monetary Policy Meeting, where Broadbent and colleagues voted for a rate cut to 0.25%. The minutes said if economic news proved consistent with the Bank\u2019s latest forecasts then \u201ca majority of members\u201d expected to support a further interest rate cut, potentially taking official borrowing costs as low as 0.1%. Ahead of the US non-farm payrolls data, out at 1.30pm BST, which are expected to show an above-average increase in employment of about 180,000, here\u2019s a quick summary of today\u2019s main developments. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has rejected suggestions that the central bank\u2019s bigger-than-expected stimulus package sent out a message of panic. He was \u201cpretty confident\u201d that it would work and provide some support to the economy soon. More here. Meanwhile, his boss, Mark Carney, insisted that the UK would avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. A new survey has shown a sharp deterioration in the UK job market. Carney warned yesterday that another quarter of a million people would lose their jobs in coming quarters following the Brexit vote. Stock markets have risen following the Bank of England\u2019s Super Thursday and solid corporate earnings updates in Europe. The FTSE 100 index in London is up 0.3% at 6762.70, a gain of more than 20 points. The pound has recovered some ground after yesterday\u2019s fall. It is trading 0.4% higher against the dollar at $1.3154. There is further evidence that the luxury property market in London is slowing. The UK capital and New York have fallen behind Rome and Madrid, according to Knight Frank\u2019s latest prime global cities index for the second quarter. Prime house prices fell 0.6% in London in the year to June, and by 0.5% in New York, the upmarket estate agent\u2019s survey showed. Vancouver came top of the list, with 36.4% growth, followed by Shanghai at 22.5%, Cape Town at 16.1% and Toronto at 12.6%. The top ten did not feature a single European city, with Dublin the highest-placed, in 13th place, with 4.9% house price growth. Here\u2019s confirmation from HSBC. An HSBC spokesperson said: Following the Base Rate announcement yesterday we have passed on the full reduction to customers with tracker mortgages today. We will also be passing on the reduction to mortgage customers on our Standard Variable Rate, which is already one of the lowest in the market and will reduce from 3.94% to 3.69% with effect from 1st September. Reuters flash: HSBC says it will pass the Bank of England\u2019s rate cut on to all mortgage customers on standard variable rates from 1 September. Meanwhile, Japanese carmaker Nissan has cast doubt on its long-term investment plans in Britain, following the referendum. The boss of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, said future decisions about its Sunderland factory, which employs 6,700 people, would depend on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. He said \u201cmost companies\u201d would be waiting for further news on Britain\u2019s trading status before making decisions about investments. He was \u201creasonably optimistic\u201d that common sense would prevail from both sides and that the UK would continue to be a key partner of the EU. He told the BBC: Well I don\u2019t think today you can talk about any impact before we see what is the new status of the UK. The question of Sunderland - Sunderland is a plant which is a European plant based in the UK. Most of the production out of Sunderland is exported to Europe. So obviously for us the relationship which is going to prevail between the UK and Europe is very important. So the future investment decisions are going to depend a lot into ... Okay, the UK is out of Europe. Fine. But what\u2019s going to be the new status? So you\u2019re going to see a period where most companies are going to be waiting to see what\u2019s going to be the new status. A new UK jobs survey showed this morning that the labour market entered \u201cfreefall\u201d after the Brexit vote. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said the number of permanent jobs placed by recruitment firms last month fell at the fastest pace since May 2009. Rupert Harrison, chief macro strategist for multi-asset at fund management giant BlackRock, who was chief of staff to ex-chancellor George Osborne, tweeted: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has sought to reassure people that Britain won\u2019t see a repeat of the financial crisis, after the central bank unveiled a big stimulus package yesterday. He told LBC radio: People should not worry about the supply of credit, this isn\u2019t after the global financial crisis, this isn\u2019t during the euro crisis \u2013 this is a modern financial sector that is working. We\u2019re not going through the same experience that the economy went through in 2008/9/10/11/12 when it was tough. Turning our attention to the key US jobs figures out at 1:30pm BST, economists polled by Reuters are forecasting a chunky 180,000 gain in employment. In June, the number of jobs created went up by a massive 287,000. Markets will be scrutinising the data for further cues on potential Federal Reserve rate hikes. The pound has clawed back some ground after the Bank of England\u2019s new stimulus package triggered its biggest daily losses in a month. Sterling gained 0.25% against the dollar to $1.3137. Against the euro, it is now flat at 84.85p, after gaining 0.2% earlier. The Office for National Statistics has put out figures for profitability at UK companies in the first quarter. The profitability of private non-financial firms, as measured by their net rate of return, improved to 12.2% between January and March, up 0.2% from the fourth quarter of last year. At manufacturers, the net rate of return rose to 12.7% from 10.3%, while service companies recorded a rate of 18.2%, a tad lower than the 18.3% in the fourth quarter. The rate of return is calculated by expressing the economic gain, or profit, as a percentage of the capital used to produce it, the ONS explains helpfully. The Bank of England\u2019s actions lifted the FTSE 100 index to a one-year high this morning. The bluechip index rose 1.6% yesterday and a further 0.5% earlier this morning to its highest level since July 2015. It has fallen back a bit, and is now trading 0.2% higher at 6755.83. A market gauge of UK firms\u2019 borrowing costs has hit a record low after the Bank of England\u2019s stimulus package, which includes a new corporate bond-buying scheme. The yield on data provider Markit\u2019s sterling-denominated corporate IBOXX index, which comprises 680 investment-grade bonds, closed at a record low of 2.53% yesterday, compared with 2.76% the day before, Reuters reported this morning. The premium companies would pay over British government borrowing costs dropped to 154 basis points from 162 bps, the lowest level seen so far this year.

Many analysts say the pound has further to fall. Julius Baer economist David A. Meier said: The decisive BoE response to the Brexit fallout allows for inflation overshoots ahead. While foreign exchange markets reacted rather unimpressed, today\u2019s measures and the potential for additions down the road will push the GBP lower gradually. We see further support for our below-consensus 12-month EUR/GBP outlook at 0.95. John Wraith, head of UK rates strategy at UBS, said: The trends of weaker sterling and outperforming gilts have reasserted themselves and are expected to continue to dominate. In equities, despite the deceleration in UK growth we do not see a significant drag to the FTSE-100 given 75% of revenues come from outside the UK. In foreign exchange, we feel comfortable with year-end targets of 0.90 for EUR/GBP and 1.29 for GBP/USD. The path for sterling is also dependent on political considerations, including the timing of the triggering of Article 50, and the evolution of economic data, but the balance of risks is for further weakness. The Bank predicted that house prices would fall over the next year, ending years of strong growth. Prices fell in July, according to the latest Halifax figures, out this morning. The average value of a home fell 1% to \u00a3214,678 last month. The drop was the third this year and mostly offset June\u2019s 1.2% increase. However figures for a single month can be erratic but the quarterly trend shows growth has slowed from earlier in the year. Royal Bank of Scotland is yet to decide whether to pass on the Bank of England\u2019s base rate cut to its borrowers, risking a row with its governor, Mark Carney, writes Jill Treanor, the Guardian\u2019s City editor. As the 73%-taxpayer owned bank slumped to a \u00a32bn half-year loss, the bank admitted it was still reviewing the implications of the historic rate cut to 0.25% which is expected to impede its ability to generate profits as quickly as hoped. Read the full story here. Lloyds Banking Group has not announced a decision yet either, as we reported last night. Other lenders quickly took action after the Bank of England\u2019s cut yesterday, however. Spanish-owned Santander and Nationwide Building Society said they would pass on the reduction in full on the standard variable rates from September. More from Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent, who was quizzed on Radio 4. Confronted with criticism from the Brexiteers that the central bank had acted too soon and risked talking down the economy, he strongly defended the stimulus package. We felt we had ample evidence to act. The referendum no doubt marked a profound change for the UK economy. Responding to other criticism that the Bank\u2019s measures would not work, Broadbent described it as a \u201csubstantial, coherent\u201d package that \u201cwill provide support for the economy\u201d. I\u2019m pretty confident it will have some effect. Pressed whether it would have a real impact soon, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor replied: We\u2019ve already seen many mortgage rates fall. Broadbent also confirmed that there was a real prospect of another interest rate cut before the end of the year. He rejected the suggestion that the Bank\u2019s real intention was to devalue the pound. Compared to sterling\u2019s tumble since the June referendum, yesterday\u2019s move was \u201crelatively small,\u201d Broadbent noted. The pound did fall very sharply immediately after the referendum and has since been relatively stable. Certainly compared with that immediate move, the move yesterday on the announcement of these measures was relatively small. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the day after the Bank of England unveiled its bigger-than-expected package of measures designed to prevent a post-Brexit recession. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent has just been on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme defending the package. Pressed whether the measures didn\u2019t send out a message of panic, he rejected that suggestion, and said there was no evidence to suggest that \u201ceasing monetary policy made things worse\u201d. I can\u2019t think of one instance where monetary easing was bad for confidence. The surprise package sent the pound down yesterday (it slumped 2 cents against the dollar) and shares soaring. Most Asian stock markets rose, with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong up 1.3%. European stock markets have opened higher today, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 0.6%, to 6782.10 in early trading. France\u2019s CAC is trading 0.7% higher, Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.9% ahead and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 1.4%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.3% higher. On \u2018Super Thursday,\u2019 the Bank cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% from 0.5% and hinted they could fall further although governor Mark Carney insisted that rates would not go negative. He also unveiled additional funds for banks to help them pass on the base rate cut to households and businesses, along with more government and corporate bond purchases by the Bank for cash, again to stimulate lending and drive borrowing costs lower. The Bank slashed its growth forecast for the UK for next year by an unprecedented amount. The economy is expected to come to a virtual standstill in coming months, although the Bank expects it to escape recession. It predicted job losses of 250,000 and slower wage growth, following the Brexit vote. Read our full story here. Business organisations and many City economists applauded the surprise package but some people were critical. Kate Barker, a former Bank of England rate-setter, warned ahead of yesterday\u2019s meeting, writing in the Times (\u00a3), that cutting interest rates would do more harm than good, and would fail to boost household or business spending. Tory politician John Redwood, a leading eurosceptic and Brexit campaigner, asked \u201cwhere is the evidence to justify the Bank\u2019s action?\u201d. He wrote on his blog: I read their forecast carefully. It is rightly riddled with uncertainty. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, was also critical, saying the measures gave the impression of \u201coverkill,\u201d and called on the government to do its bit. The contrast between what the MPC did yesterday and what they did in July was quite stark and the fact that the additional QE measures found dissent from three policymakers does appear to suggest some division on the MPC. If a company doesn\u2019t feel compelled to borrow money to invest when base rates are at 0.5%, why would it feel compelled to do so when base rates are at 0.25%? The problem in the UK isn\u2019t availability or cheapness of credit but demand for it, and that demand is only likely to come when the UK government reacts to the slowdown in the economy when it delivers its Autumn Statement later this year. We will be monitoring further reaction to the Bank of England measures as the day goes on. Today, the US non-farm payrolls figures for July are the main event. The latest jobs data are expected to show a gain of around 175,000, down from June\u2019s bumper 287,000, but above the three-month average of 148,000. The jobless rate is forecast to fall to 4.8%. In Germany, factory orders unexpectedly declined in June, by 0.4%. Data from the Economy Ministry in Berlin showed demand for investment goods slumped. But the Bundesbank has sought to reassure investors that Germany\u2019s economy merely paused for breath in the second quarter and that the Brexit vote hadn\u2019t changed the outlook for a pick-up in the current quarter. However, Siemens boss Joe Kaeser warned yesterday that political uncertainty in countries like the UK threatened to hold back orders and investment.",

But some analysts see plenty of reasons for the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hold off until after November\u2019s presidential election.</p> <p>Ken Odeluga, analyst at City Index says all eyes will now be on a speech from Fed chair Janet Yellen later this month:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cHeadline U.S. payrolls which beat expectations by about 40%, and jobs market growth that\u2019s showing signs of bursting at the seams, obviously swing the onus back on to Janet Yellen\u2019s Federal Reserve... Federal funds futures had all but priced out another rate hike this year before Friday, but chances are rising that the latest data will encourage Yellen to signal a rate rise as early as September.</p> <p>\u201cWith no Fed meeting this month, the Fed chair\u2019s speech at this year\u2019s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, between 25<sup>th</sup>-27<sup>th</sup> August, will be scrutinised closely.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But markets should interpret anything she says with care. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, highlights the market\u2019s uneasy relationship with the Fed after previous unrealised hints of action:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFOMC watchers could be forgiven for thinking the committee has taken a \u201chead in the sand\u201d approach to the US labour market. After saying for years that rates would rise if the labour market continued to improve, the FOMC appears to be holding fire on rate hikes, and as a result markets are very sceptical about the prospects of even today\u2019s strong figures leading to further tightening in the near future. However, complacency can lead to volatility and if the FOMC does finally act in September, the resulting correction in fixed income, commodities and currencies could make for an interesting autumn.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers expects a Fed move in December. He comments:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAnother solid payrolls continues to suggest a firmer underlying GDP expansion than recorded in Q2 GDP. This is consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s latest guidance that \u201cnear-term risks \u2026 diminished\u201d. We expect Q3 GDP to record a solid rebound to Q2\u2019s inventory-correction impacted growth. We think this will increase the Fed\u2019s confidence to tighten policy.

      "bodyText": "The US economy added a robust 255,000 jobs in July, the Department of Labor announced on Friday, shaking off economic headwinds that had been expected to make the jobs market stumble and increasing the likelihood of an interest rate rise. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.9%. The positive figure comes after the labor market faltered in May, adding only 24,000 jobs. Hiring rebounded in June with a net gain of 292,000, but recent economic figures and a faltering European economy had suggested another slowdown. Economists had expected a growth of about 180,000 jobs in July and for the unemployment rate to reach 4.8%. \u201cUS businesses have now added 15m jobs since private-sector job growth turned positive in early 2010, and the longest streak of total job growth on record continued in July,\u201d Jason Furman, chairman of the White House\u2019s council of economic advisers wrote in a blog post. The job figures are being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve as it weighs another interest rate hike. The Fed raised rates for the first time since the recession last December, but has since held off amid mounting economic uncertainty in Europe following Britain\u2019s referendum vote to leave the European Union and continuing signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. Capital Economics is now forecasting a 50/50 chance of a hike around the turn of the year. Alongside July\u2019s strong growth both May and June\u2019s reports were revised up. The labor department said the economy had added 18,000 more jobs over the two months than it had first calculated. The gains were widespread. Hospitality and food, leisure, professional business services, financial activities and healthcare were the strongest sectors. The government added 38,000 jobs, a strong uptick after years of cuts. But from June to July the number of people working part-time but looking for full-time jobs increased by 100,000 from 5.84 million to 5.94 million. Wages rose 8 cents, up from just 2 cents in June, suggesting the economy has added higher-wage jobs. Over the year, wages went up by 2.6% - highest since the start of the recovery, according to Chris Lu, the deputy secretary of labor. \u201cWe always like to see jump in wages,\u201d he told the Guardian, noting that the recent increase does not make up for the wage stagnation experienced by US workers over the past decade. \u201cWe need to do more on this front.\u201d Harry Holzer, former chief economist of the US Department of Labor, said: \u201cThe July employment report is very broadly positive. Payroll jobs rose by 255,000, after the outstanding number of 292,000 in June; the three-month average is now 190,000, which is much higher than previously anticipated.\u201d Economists are now divided on whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before December. In July, despite its expectations that the job market would continue to strengthen, the Fed decided to leave the US interest rates unchanged for the fifth time this year. The US central bank described the 287,000 jobs added in June as \u201cstrong\u201d gains, but raised concerns over \u201csoft\u201d business investments. Cutbacks in business spending have also been blamed for the lower-than-expected growth in gross domestic product (GDP) during the three months ending on 30 June. During that time, the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.2%, compared to the 2.6% expected by economists. Before Friday, it was unclear whether cutbacks in spending by businesses extended to jobs. Earlier this week, figures released by the payroll company ADP showed that private employers added 179,000 jobs this month \u2013 about 9,000 more than expected. And while jobless claims rose by 3,000 last week to 269,000, the number has fallen 5% over the past 12 months. \u201cClaims remain low, albeit not quite as low as they were a couple of weeks ago, but those lower readings likely reflected seasonal adjustment issues relating to annual plant shutdowns in the auto industry,\u201d according to Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cThe data remain consistent with no major slowing in the trend in employment growth.\u201d It is not unusual for the carmakers to shut down their plants for a week or two in July due to a slowdown in demand. This year, Ford shortened the shutdown at some of its facilities even as it warned that it might consider closing its UK factories after its residents voted to leave the EU. When announcing its second quarter results this month, Ford lowered its estimates for full-year industry sales in the US and said next year\u2019s sales will be even weaker. The auto industry is not the only one showing signs of a slowdown. Earlier this week, oil prices dropped below $40 a barrel for the first time since April. On Thursday, a report released by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas found that about 95,000 jobs were cut by energy firms in 2016. Coal mining industry lost more than 13,000 jobs over the past 12 months. In Kentucky, coal jobs dropped by 6.9% from April to June. The 6,465 coal jobs remaining in Kentucky as of 1 July mark the lowest level since 1898, according to state\u2019s officials. Manufacturing added 9,000 new jobs this month.",

The RBA published its much-anticipated quarterly statement on monetary policy on Friday, providing rich insight into its view of the economy. It shows the RBA has become more uncertain about the health of the labour market, because even though it had anticipated slower employment growth this year, recent forward indicators \u2013 such as job ads and vacancies \u2013 have been mixed, and there has been strong growth in part-time jobs and workers desiring longer hours. \u201cThe share of workers who would like to work more hours has been little changed over the past two years and is at a high level,\u201d the RBA statement warns. \u201cThat is, the underemployment rate (which captures the number of workers who would like more hours, as a share of the labour force) has not fallen by as much as the unemployment rate over the past year. \u201cLow growth in a range of wage measures is also consistent with a degree of spare capacity in the labour market.\u201d The unemployment rate is 5.7%. It has not been below 5.7% since April 2013. NAB\u2019s chief economist, Ivan Colhoun, said most of the risks cited by the RBA concern a weaker rather than a stronger outlook. \u201cToday\u2019s statement therefore suggests that despite the further easing by the RBA in August, the risk of additional monetary action remains significant,\u201d he said, The RBA cut the cash rate to a record low of 1.5% this week, citing anaemic inflation and record low wages growth. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, insisted it did not mean the economy was struggling, but the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said it made a mockery of the Coalition\u2019s \u201cjobs and growth\u201d slogan. On Friday, the Parliamentary Budget Office published its review of the election promises of the Coalition, Labor and the Greens showing what impact they would have on the budget. It says the Coalition made election promises that will improve the budget bottom line by $1.1bn over four years. The Greens\u2019 election commitments would improve the budget bottom line by $8.2bn over four years, while Labor\u2019s would have a negative impact of $16.6bn, it said. The report does not provide substantial figures beyond the four-year budget estimates period. Morrison said the PBO report showed Labor had learnt nothing from their \u201cpast budget failures, and would simply lock in higher spending and higher budget deficits, if given the chance\u201d. Bowen said the government\u2019s budget was \u201cpropped up by unfair \u2018zombie measures\u2019\u201d which will not pass the parliament, destroying the credibility of its fiscal position. \u201cAt the same time, it has tripled the deficit, added $100bn to net debt and put Australia\u2019s triple-A credit rating at risk,\u201d he said.",

The bank\u2019s survey follows figures from its rival Nationwide a week ago that showed prices rising 0.5% in July. Many analysts expect house prices to fall amid economic uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote on 23 June. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has predicted a slump in property transactions, with its members more gloomy about prospects than at any point since the late 1990s. Economists at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have said London prices could fall 30% and halve in the most expensive boroughs. Foxtons and other estate agents have warned that business has slowed sharply since the referendum. However, Halifax said current growth rates appeared sturdy and that there was not enough evidence of any Brexit effect on house prices. Martin Ellis, Halifax\u2019s housing economist, said: \u201cThere are signs that house price growth is slowing with a deceleration in both the annual and quarterly rates of increase in the past few months. It remains too early to determine if there has been any impact on the housing market as a result of June\u2019s EU referendum result.\u201d",

The bank\u2019s survey follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/britains-largest-estate-agent-countrywide-announces-profits-down-25\">figures from its rival Nationwide</a> a week ago that showed prices rising 0.5% in July.</p> <p>Many analysts expect house prices to fall amid economic uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote on 23 June. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/14/housing-sales-forecast-to-fall-sharply-this-summer-after-brexit-vote\">has predicted a slump in property transactions</a>, with its members more gloomy about prospects than at any point since the late 1990s. </p> <p>Economists at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have said London prices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/18/brexit-could-cut-london-house-prices-by-more-than-30-says-bank\">could fall 30% and halve</a> in the most expensive boroughs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/foxtons-profits-down-sharply-london-property-market-cools-brexit\">Foxtons and other estate agents have warned</a> that business has slowed sharply since the referendum. However, Halifax said current growth rates appeared sturdy and that there was not enough evidence of any Brexit effect on house prices.</p> <p>Martin Ellis, Halifax\u2019s housing economist, said: \u201cThere are signs that house price growth is slowing with a deceleration in both the annual and quarterly rates of increase in the past few months. It remains too early to determine if there has been any impact on the housing market as a result of June\u2019s EU referendum result.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The film industry loves a sequel and Crispin Lilly is aiming to refurbish old buildings around the country in a bid to turn the Everyman cinema chain into a nationwide blockbuster. The chain, which nearly doubled in size last year to reach 16 cinemas, is planning to open up to five a year for the next three years. It has already tied down seven sites in new developments, including in Harrogate and Chelmsford, but wants to boost expansion by acquiring other sites ripe for refurbishment. \u201cThere is something in the walls that comes out that you can\u2019t manufacture,\u201d says Lilly, who joined Everyman as chief executive two years ago, after more than 22 years in the cinema industry working for MGM, Virgin, UGC and Cineworld, thanks to a series of corporate takeovers. Last year\u2019s expansion was bumped up with the acquisition of four former Odeons \u2013 in Muswell Hill and Barnet in north London, Gerrards Cross in Buckinghamshire, and Esher in Surrey \u2013 funded by a \u00a320m share placing. The group also put a further \u00a38m in bank debt in its back pocket to support similar projects such as the reopening of an Art Deco cinema in Bristol which had been derelict for 17 years. \u201cIf anyone thinks they have got an existing cinema and wants to move on, or an old bingo hall or just a cute space we can fit in, we\u2019re interested,\u201d says Lilly. The Odeon business, which was sold to the Chinese-backed company AMC last month for \u00a3920m, was happy to offload ageing high street sites as it concentrated on opening out of town multiplexes. Potentially AMC will speed up that process and Lilly says: \u201cIf they\u2019re up for selling we\u2019re up for buying.\u201d Since reopening the former Odeons under the Everyman brand, box office takings have risen 60% on average. \u201cWe completely change the business model and can make these buildings work. There is nothing more satisfying than bringing an old cinema back to life,\u201d says Lilly. The group began life in 2000 when investors led by the young entrepreneur Daniel Broch rescued the Hampstead Everyman from administration. The venture is backed by Paul Wise, Everyman\u2019s chairman, Leonard Lewis, of the family behind the River Island fashion chain, as well as Adam and Sam Kaye, founders of the Ask pizza chain. Right from the beginning, the group was interested in creating venues that were as much about food and drink as film. But the idea really took off in 2008, when the team bought the Screen group of cinemas, adding seven more sites including the first venues outside north London. The business floated on the junior Aim market in 2013, raising \u00a38m to support expansion. It now has a market capitalisation of \u00a352m and expects to deliver its first pretax profit this year while building its portfolio outside its north London heartland. While multiplexes cater for the mainstream cinemagoer, Everyman and similar arthouse chains like Curzon and Picturehouse operate at the upper end of the market. \u201cThere is definitely a rise in boutique cinemas \u2013 they are tapping into a slightly different audience,\u201d says leisure industry analyst Nigel Parson, at Canaccord Genuity. \u201cNot everyone wants to go to a multiplex.\u201d Lilly says that offering a gin and tonic or wine in a glass, nice cake and comfy sofas from which to enjoy films helps creates a regular loyal audience. \u201cWe are targeting people who want a night out and want something more special and are prepared to pay a little bit more for extra experience,\u201d Lilly says. That includes well-off older folk, but also young professionals and families. \u201cProbably only teenagers are not really interested in us,\u201d says Lilly. All cinemas are being helped by an overall buoyant market, with admissions up 10% in the UK last year on the back of the Star Wars and Bond blockbusters, but also new digital technology which makes it easier to put on a varied programme of films in one day, rather than being stuck with one showreel. The renaissance in boutique cinemas is also being aided by the changing nature of film distribution, with an ever widening array of options for viewing films \u2013 from the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime to DVDs, Blu-Ray and iTunes. While big cinema chains vociferously defend the 16-week theatrical release window before movies become available on other media, it offers opportunity to boutiques, that are prepared to run films for shorter periods and are arguably less vulnerable to competition from home viewing services because of the premium experience they offer, according to Lilly. The boutique groups account for only about 6% of the UK cinema market, but on certain quirky films like Florence Foster Jenkins, the film about an opera-mad New York heiress, starring Meryl Streep, they can take as much as 20% of the box office. Last year Everyman\u2019s No1 film was Spectre, the latest in the Bond franchise, just like every other cinema. But Everyman\u2019s top 10 included the screen version of Alan Bennett\u2019s The Lady in the Van and the Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything which were both outside the national top 10. The appeal of the boutique chains has been tarnished by rows over the use of zero-hours contracts and low pay. All the boutique chains have been criticised and Everyman continues to use zero-hours contracts, which do not promise regular hours to staff. Poor pay and conditions grates when punters are paying as much as \u00a318.50 a pop to watch a film. Lilly says dropping the flexibility of zero-hours agreements \u201ccould seriously compromise the efficiency of the business because of the way admissions come and go\u201d. But the group has been experimenting with guaranteed monthly hours at its Birmingham branch and now plans to roll out the scheme to one or two other cinemas in the near future. \u201cWe think we could find a middle ground that will work well,\u201d he says.",
