      "bodyText": "Lord MacLaurin was the ghost at the feast at Tesco's annual meeting last year, criticising his successor Sir Terry Leahy for \"losing the plot\" and making an ill-judged foray into the US. At this year's shindig on Friday, Leahy's own successor, Philip Clarke, will probably be hoping there will be no appearance by either Leahy or MacLaurin. While the latter has so far been supportive of Clarke, there is no guarantee this will continue given Tesco's relentless decline. Leahy recently expressed himself \"disappointed\" with Tesco's performance since his departure. Clarke has enough to worry about anyway. Investors could well vent their spleen on Tesco's share price slump and falling market share as it continues to lose out to discounters Aldi and Lidl. They might also inquire how Tesco plans to deal with rival Sainsbury's plan to link up with another discounter, Netto, in a clear case of \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\". Then there is pay. Charity ShareAction has called on Tesco to pay a living wage to staff, which contrasts with the pay taken home by executives. Former chief financial officer Laurie McIlwee, for example, is in line for a golden goodbye of nearly \u00a31m when he finally leaves in October.Clarke himself received no bonus but despite Tesco's underperformance his salary rose 30% to \u00a31.63m. He also received \u00a313,000 for \"security measures\". Even these may not be enough to save him from shareholder wrath. RBS dividend on horizon? Another significant shareholder gathering takes place in Edinburgh on Wednesday, as investors in the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland meet to quiz its executives. The good news for shareholders is that they get to vote on removing the dividend access scheme, which gives the government priority over payouts and is seen as an impediment to privatisation. The bank will effectively pay \u00a31.5bn to buy itself out of the scheme, but investors will judge it worth the cost. With the proceeds of the forthcoming float of its US business Citizens, RBS could then consider reinstating dividends. Analysts at Jefferies reckon investors could see payouts resume next year. But bank bosses will also have to face the usual questions about lending \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 to small businesses and, of course, executive pay. RBS has already had to scrap plans to pay bonuses worth twice the size of salaries after Treasury opposition, but it will still hand executives payouts of up to 100% of pay. Meanwhile, shareholder group Pirc has advised voting against the bank's long-term incentive scheme. The more things change \u2026 Fed boosts pound Janet Yellen supercharged stock markets and sent the dollar tumbling last week after the US Federal Reserve's latest meeting. The Fed chair was upbeat about US economic prospects \u2013 despite actually cutting the growth forecast for 2014 because of the tough winter \u2013 and gave no sign interest rates would rise in the short term. Indeed, Fed members cut their forecasts of where US rates might end up in the future from 4% to 3.75%. So the pound jumped to a near-six-year high against the US currency, while the dollar's weakness helped lift the oil price \u2013 already on the rise due to the escalating violence in Iraq \u2013 to around $115, its highest level for nine months. The prospect of civil war in Iraq means crude prices are unlikely to ease back just yet. That of course could start to cause problems for the global economy, whose recovery is perhaps more fragile than the optimists believe. One sign of this fragility could be the final estimate of US GDP figures, due on Wednesday, which analysts believe could see a downgrade from a 1% decline to 1.7% following recent weak trade data. In contrast, analysts expect first-quarter GDP growth in the UK to be revised upwards from 0.8% to around 0.9%, thanks to positive data from the construction industry. Another sign that the Bank of England is likely to be the first of the three major central banks to raise rates.",

      "bodyText": "With a cream leather lounger strategically placed under a map of the world labelled \"the world is ours\", the Manchester office of Boohoo founder Mahmud Kamani has the menace of a Bond villain's lair. Kamani and his business partner Carol Kane are indeed plotting world domination but their weapon of choice is fashion website boohoo.com. With its \u00a38 maxi dresses and \u00a312 jeans the retailer is giving Primark a run for its money as its targets fashion-hungry 16- to 24-year-olds with limited finances. \"The map doesn't need dots,\" explains Kamani. \"We're going to get everywhere.\" For many years Boohoo had been quietly going about its business in a rundown former mill. But the Kamani family sacrificed anonymity in March when they pressed the button on a stock market listing that earned them a fortune \u2013 and a large amount of scrutiny from potential investors. The retailer has an impressive track record, having gone from a standing start in 2007 to profits of nearly \u00a311m from sales of \u00a3110m in the year to the end of February. It has just completed the first of several phases of expansion planned for its Burnley warehouses, which will eventually be able to handle sales of \u00a31bn. So far so Asos, the fast-growing fashion website, which until recently was a stock market darling. After running a private business for decades, becoming a stock market pawn can be a shock for entrepreneurs used to doing what they think is best. Kamani is a refreshingly straight talker and reportedly told analysts at a recent meeting that Boohoo's mobile website was \"shit\". He is coy when asked about it and his PR offers that \"it is being upgraded\". The listing has been a baptism of fire for the senior team, including Kamani's brother Jalal, who is trading director. After debuting at 50p the shares soared to 85p but are now back just below the offer price. The company's office has the air of a start-up, with crowded banks of desks in every room, shabby paintwork and trendy twentysomethings running around looking busy. In the foyer a man is sorting hangers into giant cardboard boxes. With more than 500 staff the company has outgrown the warren and has just bought another building around the corner. The IPO reaped \u00a3240m for the family and board members, but the pair have not been on a shopping spree. Kamani has a Rolls-Royce Phantom parked outside and Kane drives a shiny tank-like Land Rover, but they are not new. And although Kane is doing up an old house in Staffordshire she jokes it \"would be nice to have a bathroom\". Indeed Kamani labours the point that Boohoo is not an overnight success but the culmination of decades of graft. \"This is not an eight-year story; this is a family business that's been going for 30 years.\" A key figure is Mahmud's elderly father Abdullah, who escaped war-torn Kenya in the 60s to start a new life in the north-west with his wife and four children. Abdullah's first venture was selling handbags on a market stall, but he went on to found what would become a successful family textile business, supplying high street names such as New Look and Primark, before he focused on Boohoo. \"It was a case of rags to riches for my dad,\" explains Kamani. \"He bought his first Rolls-Royce 30 years ago and let my eldest brother Jalal drive it out of the garage. He adds: \"My father is 80 and comes into work every day.\" Kamani appears to have inherited his father's work ethic and is either on the phone or looking at messages on one of his two handsets when the conversation lulls. He is momentarily distracted by an email and elbows Kane. It turns out that the latest sales figures have come through and he is surprised how good they are. She quickly explains that a promotion has just kicked in. \"People have invested in us and that's an honour,\" he continues. \"We work hard. We worked hard when we were on the market stalls; we work hard now. It's what we've always done. I don't have another hobby or life. I want to walk into my office an old man.\" After proving useful in the runup to the flotation, the comparison with Asos stopped being favourable earlier this month, when Asos blamed the strong pound and heavy discounting for a massive profit warning. The alert spooked investors, wiping as much as 40% off Asos's share price on the day and pulling Boohoo down with it. It has led to a dramatic reappraisal of Asos's prospects, with Morgan Stanley analyst Anisha Singhai slashing her price for the stock from \u00a340 to \u00a325. (Asos suffered a further setback this weekend when a fire at its Barnsley warehouse forced it to stop taking orders.) On the surface the fashion websites have a lot in common, but there are key differences. While Asos carries 75,000 products, including 1,000 third-party brands, Boohoo stocks just 9,000 of its own clothing lines. Kane, who is co-chief executive of the listed group, says the focus on own-brand is key. \"We're in full control of our pricing structure all the way through,\" she says. \"If you want to promote your own brand you haven't got any restrictions.\" After working together for more than 20 years \u2013 Kane set up its design team in 1993 \u2013 the co-chief executives are prone to interrupting each other. \"Any business doing international trade will have challenges on foreign exchange,\" continues Kamani. \"But we only sell Boohoo, so we command the price.\" Unusually Boohoo buys very small quantities of stock, 300-500 pieces at a time, with one in four orders then repeated. \"Because this is an e-commerce business you've got to be fresh all the time,\" says Kane. \"A traditional retailer might buy three or four styles but we'll buy 25. That way we've covered off the overall volume required and the one that really works we'll get back into.\" At the moment Boohoo has seven major markets, including the UK, US and France, although it ships to more than 100. Despite the breakneck growth of recent years the cream lounger still looks pristine. Kamani says he never uses it for brainstorming sessions. \"Once I was really tired and actually laid on it and tried to rest,\" he says. \"But every fucker kept walking through the door because I always say my door's open.\"",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The financial policy committee may conclude the property boom has not spread nationwide, but doing nothing is not an option", 
      "body": "<p>The Bank of England's financial policy committee has reached crunch time. Set up by George Osborne to prevent asset bubbles from derailing the economy, the state of Britain's housing market provides the FPC with an early test of its mettle. On Thursday it will reveal the concerns aired by its members at their quarterly meeting last week and publish their action plan.</p> <p>Doing nothing is not an option. Sure, there has been an easing in activity in the past couple of months, but it would be a mistake to see this as anything other than temporary, caused in part by the reluctance of sellers to put their homes on the market; in part by tougher checks by lenders on the financial viability of borrowers; and in part by potential buyers taking a good hard look at whether they want to pay the sort of prices currently being asked.</p> <p>The FPC should look through these temporary factors and focus on the underlying picture. While this shows that, as yet, bubble conditions only really apply in London \u2013 where prices are already 25% up on their pre-recession peak (and 55% higher in central London) \u2013 there are plenty of warning signs flashing.</p> <p>These include the tendency for property booms to ripple out from the capital, the expectation that prices will keep on rising, the increase in the number of high loan-to-value mortgages agreed in the past year and the fact that house prices began this cycle at a relatively high level.</p> <p>Stir in rising consumer confidence and falling unemployment and all the ingredients are there for the housing market recovery to enter a second phase in the next couple of months. Activity and prices are likely to rise.</p> <p>So what does the FPC do about all this? First, it has to decide whether the housing market currently poses a systemic risk to financial stability. With banks holding more capital than they did and interest rates low, the answer is no, at least for now.</p> <p>Second, it has to decide whether London is typical of the whole country. Again, the answer is no. House prices in parts of the country furthest from London are still a long way below where they were before the recession began in 2008.</p> <p>Third, the FPC has to consider whether a future bout of rapid house-price inflation could be destabilising. Britain's history over the past 40 years, coupled with the fact that property already looks expensive, suggests the answer to this question is yes.</p> <p>Finally, then, the issue is what the FPC decides to do about it. Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, has made it clear that he thinks the underlying problem with the property market is that not enough houses are being built, and that is something Threadneedle Street can do nothing about.</p> <p>But the Bank does have a range of powers it can use to moderate demand. It has the power of rhetoric, and this should not be underestimated, particularly since the FPC can warn that if the boom gets out of hand its sister body, the monetary policy committee, will have no choice but to put up interest rates.</p> <p>But there are more direct ways the FPC can make its mark.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England's financial policy committee has reached crunch time. Set up by George Osborne to prevent asset bubbles from derailing the economy, the state of Britain's housing market provides the FPC with an early test of its mettle. On Thursday it will reveal the concerns aired by its members at their quarterly meeting last week and publish their action plan. Doing nothing is not an option. Sure, there has been an easing in activity in the past couple of months, but it would be a mistake to see this as anything other than temporary, caused in part by the reluctance of sellers to put their homes on the market; in part by tougher checks by lenders on the financial viability of borrowers; and in part by potential buyers taking a good hard look at whether they want to pay the sort of prices currently being asked. The FPC should look through these temporary factors and focus on the underlying picture. While this shows that, as yet, bubble conditions only really apply in London \u2013 where prices are already 25% up on their pre-recession peak (and 55% higher in central London) \u2013 there are plenty of warning signs flashing. These include the tendency for property booms to ripple out from the capital, the expectation that prices will keep on rising, the increase in the number of high loan-to-value mortgages agreed in the past year and the fact that house prices began this cycle at a relatively high level. Stir in rising consumer confidence and falling unemployment and all the ingredients are there for the housing market recovery to enter a second phase in the next couple of months. Activity and prices are likely to rise. So what does the FPC do about all this? First, it has to decide whether the housing market currently poses a systemic risk to financial stability. With banks holding more capital than they did and interest rates low, the answer is no, at least for now. Second, it has to decide whether London is typical of the whole country. Again, the answer is no. House prices in parts of the country furthest from London are still a long way below where they were before the recession began in 2008. Third, the FPC has to consider whether a future bout of rapid house-price inflation could be destabilising. Britain's history over the past 40 years, coupled with the fact that property already looks expensive, suggests the answer to this question is yes. Finally, then, the issue is what the FPC decides to do about it. Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, has made it clear that he thinks the underlying problem with the property market is that not enough houses are being built, and that is something Threadneedle Street can do nothing about. But the Bank does have a range of powers it can use to moderate demand. It has the power of rhetoric, and this should not be underestimated, particularly since the FPC can warn that if the boom gets out of hand its sister body, the monetary policy committee, will have no choice but to put up interest rates. But there are more direct ways the FPC can make its mark. It can toughen up the amount of capital that banks have to hold against high loan-to-value mortgages. It could suggest that other lenders follow the example of RBS and Lloyds and announce that they will not lend more than four times the income of a borrower on loans in excess of \u00a3500,000. And it could toughen up the terms of the mortgage market review, under which lenders have to be sure that borrowers can live with mortgage rates much higher than they are today. At the moment, the benchmark is 7%. Raising that to 8% would not just limit the number of first-time buyer loans: it would be a statement of intent. Green sees red? Were Sir Philip Green to find that one of his Topshop staff had mistakenly put \u00a32 products on sale for 2p each, you imagine that he would hit the roof. So you can probably picture his immediate reaction when the Australian online fashion discounter MySale, in which he holds a 22% stake, fumbled its stock market debut last week. Thanks to an error by one of its brokers the shares were listed on the first day not in the correct form of 226p, but at \u00a32.26 instead. Some automated trading systems in the City interpreted that figure as 2.26p, thus beginning a selloff of the shares at discount prices. At one point the shares were down by around 27%, and even though a statement trying to clarify the situation was rushed out, the error in pricing was not corrected until the next day.

In private, he was probably a little less relaxed, since the episode took some of the shine off his return to the stock market.

So the trades involved are unlikely to be cancelled despite the confusion. Less caveat emptor, more caveat venditor, it seems. But would it be a surprise if some eagle-eyed lawyer took a look at the situation? Grocer's imitation game There is a seismic shift going on in the grocery business: trips to huge out-of-town superstores are out, while online, local and discount shopping are in. The big four grocers, as a result, are haemorrhaging customers, who are saving money and time going to Aldi, Lidl etc. On Friday, Sainsbury's announced it was going 50-50 with Scandinavian discounter Netto to bring its stores back to Britain (Netto was here before, but sold out to Asda), starting in Yorkshire.

      "bodyText": "When Phil Harrow drowned his sorrows following the Costa Rica victory that sent England home from the World Cup on Friday, he had to drink deeper than most fans. Gone were not just his dreams of football honours, but his plans for the much-vaunted supporters' song he wrote with his brother, Richard. \"I put everything into this, for all the right reasons,\" said Harrow, who is from north London. \"I believed it was the passionate, patriotic thing to do.\" His song Hope &amp; Glory/The Eve of War was created in collaboration with Jeff Wayne, the creator of 1970s concept album War of the Worlds, at a cost of \u00a330,000, and features the voice of actor Andy Serkis in a stirringly reworded rendition of one its best known tracks. Recorded at Abbey Road studios, it was billed as a rank outsider at first, yet had rapidly threatened to overtake Rik Mayall's posthumously popular offering as the nation's favourite World Cup song. Harrow, of course, is not alone in his loss. The country's publicans and retailers are also grieving over hundreds of millions of pounds of lost sales as the football feelgood factor leaks away from the high street. \"There are thousands of publicans around the country weeping into empty beer glasses,\" said media commentator Mark Borkowski. \"It's the people who benefit from the mood of the nation that are licking their wounds: the myriad who work in hospitality and the big supermarkets with their barbecue promotions. I'm pretty sure there's a warehouse somewhere in Hendon full of cheap plastic hats and inflatable Spitfires that were ready to be rushed out to market stalls around the country.\" Ahead of the tournament one report calculated that every goal scored by England was worth \u00a3200m to the retail and leisure industry. Early signs had pointed to a bonanza, with official data showing retail spending rising at the fastest pace in almost a decade. According to the Office for National Statistics, sales in sports shops during May were nearly 30% higher than last year. At the start of last week, when hopes were high, JD Sports told the City that its World Cup-related sales were so good it daren't publish them for fear of \"misleading\" investors. Now JD must count the cost of lost sales and overstocks, like market leader Sports Direct, which enjoyed a sales boost in 2010 when England made it to the knockout stage. Other retailers had also flagged World Cup boosts, with John Lewis showing a sharp weekly rise in demand for TVs, while sister chain Waitrose saw beer sales jump by 50%. Its barbecue meat sales almost doubled too, while sales of salads were up more than a third. \"England's exit is definitely bad news for retailers,\" said Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Roberts. \"It will have a discernible impact on shopping behaviour and there will have to be a lot of clearance activity on football tat.\" VoucherCodes.co.uk, which came up with the \u00a3200m-a-goal figure, said consumers would have spent as much as \u00a31bn overall if England had got beyond the group stage. \"England's devastating loss to Uruguay broke the hearts of millions of fans, and it's certainly disappointing to our retail and leisure industry too,\" said Claire Davenport, its managing director. The competition was predicted to deliver a more than 5% boost to UK advertising revenue, fuelled by spending on the special, although now less appealing, adverts fronted by England stars such as goalkeeper Joe Hart, who appeared for Gillette, Doritos and Head &amp; Shoulders, and Wayne Rooney, who turned out for Samsung. The 2010 World Cup delivered a big fillip for ITV, but, after England's poor showing, that is unlikely this time. \"If England had gone through there would have been a lot of advertising money for retail, be it for pizza, barbecues, anything you can think of to entertain yourself,\" said Chris Locke, group trading director of Starcom MediaVest Group. That spending he says, will now dry up: \"People who haven't already committed to ads and have kept the budget to the side of the table will probably not spend that now.\"",
