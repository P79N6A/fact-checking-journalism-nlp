    "webTitle": "David Cameron vows to press on with deficit reduction", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron pledged to go \"further and faster\" in reducing the deficit after the UK was stripped of its coveted AAA credit rating. The prime minister insisted that the one notch cut to the debt rating was a reason to press ahead with balancing the public finances, despite claims by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, that the UK now had a \"downgraded government, a downgraded chancellor and a downgraded prime minister\". Speaking at prime minister's questions, Cameron said : \"I'm the one saying this credit rating does matter, and it demonstrates that we have to go further and faster on reducing the deficit.\" The heated exchanges in parliament, where Miliband experienced one of his most awkward moments at PMQs when asked about the future of shadow chancellor Ed Balls, came after official figures reaffirmed that the economy had contracted by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2012. Some economists pointed to upward revisions of previous quarters that showed that on some measures \u2013 excluding the impact of the volatile oil business \u2013 the economy escaped a double-dip recession following an uprating to 0% in the first quarter of 2012. However, the economy only grew by 0.3% year-on-year, despite the boost from the Olympics. Sluggish growth has sparked a debate about the role of monetary policy which resumed when Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean described negative interest rates as nothing more than \"blue-sky thinking\". Bean was speaking the day after his fellow deputy Paul Tucker had floated the idea of the rates, which effectively charge high street banks for depositing money with the central bank. This led to complaints over the possible impact on savers but Bean said that such policies would prove difficult to implement and were unjustified at the moment despite the economy's current woes. This raised the prospect that Bank of England officials are at loggerheads over how to support the economy, demonstrated by the last meeting of the monetary policy committee meeting when three officials, including the governor Sir Mervyn King, voted to increase the level of quantitative easing (QE) by \u00a325bn to \u00a3400bn. Other members, who have privately voiced concerns that QE has run out of steam, are known to back rival policies. Across the Atlantic, US Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke also attacked the use of negative interest rates, which some countries have used to discourage high street banks keeping money on deposit with their central bank. He said: \"It has significant negative side-effects which is why I do not support it.\" In the Commons, Cameron taunted Miliband by saying that he would never sit on the government side of the House unless he accepted the need to cut borrowing. Miliband was faced with an extremely awkward moment when he dismissed the New Statesman magazine \u2013 one of the few publications to endorse his leadership campaign \u2013 after Cameron quoted a recent article calling for Ed Balls to be sacked. Reading from the article on 20 February by Anthony Seldon, the author of Brown at 10, the prime minister said: \"Let's examine the fact that the New Statesman, the in-house magazine of the Labour party, says this: 'His critique of the government strategy will never win back public trust, his proposals for the economy will never convince, his credibility problem will only become magnified as the general election approaches.'\" He added: \"That's not Conservative Central Office. That is the New Statesman.\" Miliband then managed to offend one of his few media supporters when he replied: \"With the greatest of respect to the New Statesman, he is scraping the barrel really by quoting the New Statesman.\" Helen Lewis, the magazine's deputy editor, immediately tweeted: \"Better to be talked about than not talked about, eh? #silverlining.\" Sensing Miliband's discomfort, George Osborne leaned over to the prime minister, apparently passing on a piece of intelligence. Cameron then said: \"He says the New Statesman is scraping the barrel. It was the only newspaper that endorsed his leadership. I have to say in this Oscar week perhaps the best we can say is Daniel Day-Lewis was utterly convincing as Abraham Lincoln and [Ed Miliband] is utterly convincing as Gordon Brown \u2013 more borrowing, more spending, more debt.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The acrimonious debate over soaring energy bills and mounting fuel poverty reignited when British Gas \u2013 the biggest energy supplier in the UK \u2013 unveiled an 11% increase in profits and its parent group, Centrica, promised a \u00a31.3bn handout to its shareholders just months after pushing through an increase in household bills. Campaign groups warned that 160,000 children had been dragged into fuel poverty by the actions of the big six energy suppliers since 2010, while trade union bosses accused energy chiefs of \"creaming off\" profits. Dividends of more than \u00a33.5bn have now been paid out by Centrica over the last five years. Anger was exacerbated by confirmation that Phil Bentley, British Gas's managing director, will stand down with a combined pay and pension package worth more than \u00a310m. British Gas imposed a 6% price rise last November, adding \u00a380 to the average annual gas and electricity bill for the 8.4 million households it serves. Centrica argued that the average profit figure of \u00a350 per British Gas household represented a profit margin of only 5%, which it said was a similar return to supermarkets. The company said the profits had allowed the energy group to invest \u00a350bn to secure new wholesale gas supplies from countries such as Norway and Russia. \"It's important that Centrica makes a fair and reasonable return so that we can continue to make our contribution to society and to invest,\" said Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica. \"Last year we incurred a tax charge of over \u00a31bn and invested over \u00a32bn to secure new sources of energy for the UK, well in excess of our profits.\" But the campaign group Fuel Poverty Action warned that the British Gas profit of more than \u00a3600m would send a \"shiver down the spine\" of customers, with some facing the choice between heating and eating due to recent price hikes. \"These profits were made on the back of forcing millions into fuel poverty and from a 'dash for gas' that will send bills even higher as well as contributing to rising food prices through climate change,\" said the campaign's spokesman, James Granger. \"People are angry and want the alternative to the big six's monopoly: cheaper, clean, renewable energy under the control of communities, not greedy energy tycoons.\" Centrica reported operating profits of \u00a32.7bn \u2013 up 14% \u2013 and announced plans to hand an additional \u00a3500m to shareholders this year by buying back, and then cancelling, its own shares. The process should increase the share price. Nick Luff, the finance director, said it was fair to give back cash to investors because Centrica had raised \u00a32bn from them in 2008 to invest in new nuclear power stations. It has now dropped those plans. He urged customers to \"take action\" by installing more efficient boilers, improving insulation and utilising new technology such as smart meters. The Energy Bill Revolution, a campaign group formed by charities including Barnardo's plus old age and disability groups, warned that an extra 160,000 children had been forced to live in homes in fuel poverty over the last two years. The organisation warned that a further 25% increase in power bills could double the total number of people affected from 1.6 million to 3.2 million. It called on the prime minister to end the \"growing scandal\" of cold homes by using a carbon tax to make all UK homes super energy efficient. Meanwhile Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, said it was a scandal that so many children were now living in freezing homes while shareholders and directors were \"creaming\" off profits. \"The rise in fuel poverty is a blight on this country with hundreds and thousands of people joining the growing numbers now spending more than 10% of household income on energy costs. Without action we are sleepwalking into a very cold and dark future,\" he warned. The issue of soaring energy bills combined with fines for doorstep mis-selling and other abuses by the gas and electricity suppliers has triggered a raft of initiatives by the industry regulator, Ofgem, but campaigners and even politicians believe they are not nearly tough enough. The Labour party has said it will scrap Ofgem while a report by the all-party House of Commons energy and climate change select committee in December attacked the regulator's timidity. \"We find it unsatisfactory that Ofgem should be so hesitant about launching preliminary investigations into potentially anti-competitive behaviour,\" it said. The general climate of unease has not been helped by a Financial Services Authority inquiry into concerns about irregular trading in the wholesale gas market. Centrica and the other large energy companies such as RWE npower and E.ON have all instigated their own internal inquiries and say they are convinced none of their traders are at fault. Bentley, the 54-year-old former BP executive who has been at the centre of previous rows over the scale of big six energy company earnings, plans to leave British Gas by the end of the year and is apparently hoping to become a chief executive elsewhere. But it was also revealed that the energy boss will be able to retire in four years time with an annual pension of \u00a3225,000 after working for the company for little over 12 years. A statement from Centrica paid tribute to his role in \"profit improvement\". It said: \"In his most recent role he [Bentley] has been instrumental in restructuring, reinvigorating and materially improving the performance of the business by raising customer service standards, lowering costs, increasing productivity and creating significant value from profit improvement.\"",

      "bodyText": "Barclays has clawed back up to \u00a3300m in bonuses paid to staff, after being fined for Libor-rigging and paying out millions for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance and interest rate swaps. The bank is expected to reveal in next week's annual report the extent to which it has reclaimed bonuses paid to its staff in previous years to try to demonstrate to shareholders that it is heeding their calls for pay restraint. The bank previously insisted it had cut the bonus pool (which still stands at \u00a31.8bn) by the equivalent of the \u00a3290m fine for manipulating Libor. The Libor events forced out the chief executive, Bob Diamond, in July 2012. Sky News calculated that on this basis the loss to staff, due to the penalty for rigging the key benchmark rate, was \u00a3450m \u2013 the total of the cut to the bonus pool over the \u00a3290m fine, plus about half of the \u00a3300m being clawed back from staff. The remainder of the clawback is the result of provisions for PPI, which have in the past two years cost the bank \u00a32.6bn, while the total cost of the mis-selling of interest rates swaps to small businesses has reached \u00a3850m. Even before last year's Libor-rigging fine, Barclays' pay policies had infuriated shareholders, who staged a rebellion at last year's annual meeting when nearly a third of them failed to back the remuneration report. The bank is keen to avoid a fresh revolt at this annual meeting after its report outlining directors' pay and the clawback provisions is published next month. Barclays' new chairman, Sir David Walker, who replaced Marcus Agius in the wake of the Libor scandal, has already sanctioned a move to provide a break-down of numbers of staff falling within certain pay brackets. This is expected to show that as many as 600 staff took home more than \u00a31m in 2012, despite the clawbacks and attempts by the bank to show that it was cutting top pay. Other banks are also expected to be forced to follow the disclosures on pay, including Royal Bank of Scotland which on Thursday is scheduled to publish the extent of its losses for 2012 when it also received a fine, of \u00a3390m, for rigging Libor. Bailed out with \u00a345bn of taxpayer money, RBS has already said its bonus pot has been cut by \u00a3300m, the part of its Libor fine that is being paid to the US authorities. About 1,500 RBS bankers are also seeing their bonuses clawed back due to the Libor fine. The total size of the bonus pot for 2012 is expected to be in the region of \u00a3250m to \u00a3300m, down on the near \u00a3800m handed out the previous year. Stephen Hester, chief executive of RBS, is expected to insist that the bank is on track to resume dividends in 2014 \u2013 for the first time since the banking crisis \u2013 despite the torrid performance last year. Hester is expected to unveil a partial flotation of the bank's US arm Citizens to enable the bailed-out bank to focus more on its domestic market. George Osborne, the chancellor, has called on RBS, a bank 82% owned by the taxpayer, to focus on UK small business, corporate and personal banking.

    "webTitle": "Eurozone crisis: Deadlock in Italy as Grillo rejects centre-left  ", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Italian politics remains deadlocked tonight after efforts to form an alliance between the centre-left bloc, the Democratic Party, and Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement collapsed. However, calm has returned to the financial markets after yesterday's heavy losses. From Rome, Lizzy Davies sums up the situation: Grillo unleashed a characteristic tirade of insults on Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of the Democratic party (PD), who on Tuesday extended an olive branch to the M5S in a bid to create a reformist government. The ex-comic ruled out giving a crucial confidence vote in parliament to a centre-left government and reiterated that the M5S's new legion of deputies and senators would vote on laws on a case-by-case basis. \"The M5S will give no confidence vote to the PD (or to anyone else),\" Grillo wrote on his blog. \"It will vote in the chamber for laws which chime with its programme, whoever proposes them.\" Grillo's move appears to thwart Bersani's hopes of forming a working majority in the Senate with Five Star - there is speculation that Italy could face a year of instability. Lizzy's full story is online here. Here are the other key developments: \u2022 Silvio Berlusconi has continued to push for a Grand Coalition with Bersani... \u2022 ...but Bersani's junior coalition partner has ruled it out \u2022 Italy's president has rebuked German opposition politician, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, for his comments about clowns winning the election. They are no longer meeting for dinner. \u2022 European stock markets have risen, recovering some of yesterday's losses, with the Italian FTSE MIB jumping 1.7% \u2022 Italian government bonds also strengthened....after a successful debt auction \u2022 Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, has argued that Europe's austerity reforms can deliver a fairer society \u2022 And in Greece, there is a worrying medicine shortage Thanks for reading. We'll be back tomorrow morning. Goodnight! European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has given a speech tonight in which he acknowledged the deep pain being caused by Europe's austerity programmes. Draghi, Italy's former central bank governor, insisted though that economic reforms and fiscal cutbacks can deliver a fairer society in the long term. In his first public comments since the Italian election results, Draghi said: The benefits of the painful actions undertaken so far have not yet materialized. And this means that economic adjustment is coming at a heavy social cost... We are fully aware of the human dimension that lies behind it. Draghi cited the record youth unemployment levels -- more than half of young people in Greece and Spain are out of work. That is unfair, he said. Is that fair, that as a result, this generation has to bear the bulk of the burden in the downturn? That's why I say that reforms that make economies work better also make them fairer. Draghi has previously argued that 'structural' problems with Europe's economies have worsened the impact of the crisis. The full speech is online here: Here's some analysis of the political situation in Italy tonight from Alberto Nardelli: He explains that Beppe Grillo's decision to refuse to form an alliance with the centre-left Democratic Party (read it at 4.50pm) isn't a surprise, but it is very significant. It effectively sinks Pier Luigi Bersani's chances of running a minority government. An abstention in Italy\u2019s Senate in a confidence vote would be akin to a no-vote, meaning a Bersani government wouldn\u2019t have the majority required to install a government. Italy\u2019s President, Napolitano, is unlikely to send Bersani to parliament to seek a confidence vote unless he believes there is a majority. Alberto also believes that Silvio Berlusconi is waiting for Bersani to cave in and seek a grand coalition. Today's video statement (see 6.15pm) shows that Berlusconi wants a deal on tax cuts and institutional reforms. And his conclusion is that we are unlikely to get new elections, if needed, within the next six months, because: 1) the new parliament sits in 2-3 weeks, and needs to elect presidents for each chamber, and parliamentary groups need to be formed. 2) President Napolitano consults with all stakeholders - presidents of the chambers, parliamentary groups and parties to explore if there is a parliamentary majority around a potential government/s. 3) whatever happens, the current president\u2019s terms is ending and Napolitano cannot dissolve parliament and call new elections - parliament needs to elect a new president. 4) internal party dynamics - should Bersani be unable to form a government and new elections needed it is unlikely Bersani would lead the PD into these elections - this means: party congress, primaries, selection of candidates etc. The same on the centre-right - would Berlusconi stand again? What would Monti &amp; Co. do? The full piece is online here. If you're interested in the debate about Europe's austerity programme, check out this new blog post by an influential London fund manager (regularly quoted in this blog in the past as @pawelmorski). Government Bond Markets: Unfeeling Psychopaths or Rational Keynesians? It's a brisk rebuttal of a recent research paper which argued that the fiscal consolidation being imposed on European countries was largely the fault of the \"fear and panic that erupted in the financial markets\". The paper (by Paul De Grauwe and Yuemei Ji) was published last week and got a lot of attention in the media (here's a good piece). Its broad theme is that from 2010 to 2012 the markets acted irrationally, recklessly ditching sovereign debt, and forcing painful, unnecessary and self-defeating cutbacks and tax rises on swathes of Southern Europe. Well, here's a flavour of the counter-argument: Panic is a funny word. Jumping out of a moving bus can look like panic. However, if the driver \u2013 let\u2019s call him Jean-Claude \u2013 is absolutely adamant that he wants to drive said bus off a cliff (think of M. Trichet\u2019s threats to pull the repo-able status of Greek debt and later refusal to allow the ECB to get involved in a rescue), and the conductor (Wolfgang) is similarly vehement about fiscal assistance \u2013 jumping out starts to look quite rational. The ECB (especially) and the core countries spent most of 2010-mid-2012 declaring an absolute refusal to assist the peripheral nations. As a result, Europe\u2019s money supply began to resemble a badly-sloping field, where all the liquidity is drained from one end (the periphery) and swamps the core. That changed when the European Central Bank finally took bold sweeping steps last summer, at which point the governments of Spain and Italy saw their borrowing costs fall to safer levels. In this case, blaming the markets actually is therefore blaming the alarm for the fire, and measures to control spread volatility like measures to prevent fire casualties by removing the alarms. The point is that the recent recovery in market optimism has been driven by the actions of central bankers like Mario Draghi - not ever-deeper fiscal cutbacks. More here. (don't be offended by the opening paragraph. he loves us really). A grim reminder from Athens tonight that the situation in Greece remains perilous. The drugs shortage in the country, already bad, is getting much worse, warns Elizabeth Sukkar and Helena Smith from Athens: Hundreds of drugs are in short supply and the situation is getting worse, according to the Greek drug regulator. The government has drawn up a list of more than 50 pharmaceutical companies it accuses of halting or planning to halt supplies because of low prices in the country. More than 200 medicinal products are affected, including treatments for arthritis, hepatitis C and hypertension, cholesterol-lowering agents, antipsychotics, antibiotics, anaesthetics and immunomodulators used to treat bowel disease. Separately, it was announced on Tuesday that the Swiss Red Cross was slashing its supply of donor blood to Greece because it had not paid its bills on time. The full story is here. Silvio Berlusconi has just released a video clip in which he argues that Italian political parties must prioritise political stability. As he puts it: No political force can not ignore the value of responsible governance. Berlusconi goes on to pledge that, if involved in the next government, he will push for an end to European-imposed austerity, and reform Italy's democratic systems to provide stability. With Beppe Grillo refusing to make a deal with the centre-left, Berlusconi appears to making another bit for a Grand Coalition. Nicol\u00f2 Cavalli, an economics student and researcher, comments: Italian government debt has also strengthened in value, having falling heavily on Tuesday after the votes were counted. This means the yield (or interest rate) on an Italian 10-year bond is now trading at 4.79% tonight, down from 4.89% last night. That's an encouraging sign for Italy -- suggesting the political deadlock isn't spooking bond traders too badly this afternoon. Despite the swirling political developments in Italy, the country's stock market ended higher today, recovering a decent chunk of yesterday's losses. Other European markets also rose. Italy wasn't the only factor - Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has reassured traders by insisting that there are no plans to end the US stimulus programme. Closing prices: Italy's FTSE MIB: up 274 points at 15827, +1.7% FTSE 100: up 55 points at 6325, +0.88% German DAX: up 78 points at 7675, +1% French CAC: up 69 points at 3691, + 1.9% Spanish IBEX: up 156 points at 8136, + 1.95% Italian news agency Adnkronos is reporting that Italy's president has now rebuked Germany's Peer Steinbr\u00fcck over his comments about clowns winning the election (see 2.24pm) I mentioned earlier that Napolitano had cancelled a planned meeting with Steinbr\u00fcck - turns out that the pair would have been having supper together: Open Europe, the think tank, have translated Beppe Grillo's stinging attack on Pier Luigi Bersani into English: (the original is still here) Bersani is a political stalker. He's been pestering the Five-Star Movement for days with indecent proposals, instead of resigning as everyone else would do in his situation.\" \"Over the past twenty years, [Bersani's] Democratic Party was in government for ten years, and over the past year-and-a-half it even took part in the grand coalition government with [Berlusconi's] PdL party, backing any sort of junk proposed by Rigor Montis [Grillo's nickname for Mario Monti].\" \"The Five-Star Movement won't give any confidence vote to the Democratic Party or others. It will support in parliament only the laws that mirror its programme - whoever proposes them. Grillo also regaled his readers with a list of comments which Bersani made about Five Star Movement during the campaign, which don't look quite so clever now: \"There's little democracy in the Five-Star Movement.\" Five-Star Movement people are \"web fascists. Come out call us zombies.\" \"With Grillo, we will end like Greece.\" \"Lenin is not even nearly as bad as Grillo.\" \"Grillo leads to disaster.\" \"Grillo makes promises like Berlusconi.\" \"If Grillo wins, the country will be in trouble.\" \"Grillo? He can take us out of Europe.\" \"Grillo takes people out of democracy.\" \"Grillo is a third-rate autocrat.\" (and if you're just joining us, the mocked-up image of Bersani in a shroud is here) Here's the political situation in Italy this evening: 1) Beppe Grillo has rejected the overtures of the centre-left, dashing Pier Luigi Bersani's hopes of an alliance that would give his centre-left party a majority in the Senate - see 2.36 GMT onwards. 2) Grillo made the move alongside a brutal attack on Bersani - dubbing him a stalker and a dead man talking who should quit. 3) Bersani's junior partner has ruled out the other option, a Grand Coalition with Silvio Berlusconi - see 3.15pm GMT. Conclusion: we are no further towards a functional government in Italy This is the tweet from Beppe Grillo in which he made clear that the Five Star Movement would not ally with the Democratic Party (PD). The Financial Times agrees that it's a significant step: Italy\u2019s political deadlock following inconclusive elections took a turn for the worse on Wednesday when Beppe Grillo announced that his Five Star Movement would not give a vote of confidence in parliament to any government led by the two main parties. Beppe Grillo's stunning victory has left many people wanting to know more about him and the Five Star movement. My colleague Lizzy Davies has written about the political novices who have won parliamentary seats for the first time in this election. Italy prepares to meet the 'Grillini': young, civic-minded and female Here's a flavour: The man on whom the spotlight has shone is, unsurprisingly, Beppe Grillo, the mane-haired former comedian and blogger who created the movement in 2009. But what is now on the minds of many are the dozens of people who have lined up behind him and have, out of nowhere, got to prove their political mettle at a time of crisis. \"These are ordinary people. They are all completely new. None of them have ever stepped into any kind of chamber in their life,\" said Duncan McDonnell of the European University Institute in Florence. \"Any single new party, if it has a sudden spurt of growth, always has the problem of how to handle it, because it doesn't have the structures and the rules and the personnel to handle this kind of vote. But now, of course, on top of this you've also got the fact that we've got a log-jam [in the parliament]. And the M5S has become very important.\" And if you've never seen Grillo in action....Genoa's newspaper, Il Secolo XIX, has a good video clip of the M5S leader speaking to reporters. It's here: It's official - the Left Ecology Freedom party, which teamed up with Pier Luigi Bersani in the election, is refusing to take part in a coalition with Silvio Berlusconi. Reuters has the full details: The junior partner in Italy's centre-left coalition on Wednesday rejected forming a governing alliance with the centre-right after neither side won enough seats to govern in this week's election. \"No grand coalition,\" said Nichi Vendola, leader of the Left Ecology Freedom party, after a meeting with centre-left leader Pier Luigi Bersani. In a statement, Vendola said he hoped populist leader Beppe Grillo did not want a right-left government either, and called for a government that would \"give an electric shock\" to the country. It's moving fast in Italy... one of Bersani's allies has ruled out a deal with Berlusconi's People of Freedom party, reports Reuters. Here's the newsflash: ITALY CENTRE-LEFT JUNIOR COALITION PARTNER REJECTS GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE WITH CENTRE-RIGHT Looking for the details now.... Beppe Grillo's decision (see 2.36pm) leaves Pier Luigi Bersani in a very difficult position. If an alliance with Five Star is ruled out, then his only hope of a majority is through a grand coalition with Silvio Berlusconi. Political analyst Alberto Nardelli explains: Big news from Italy - Beppe Grillo has ruled out forming an alliance with the centre-left, dashing hopes that the two sides could form a stable government. The leader of the Five Star Movement made the announcement in a blog post in which he blasted Pier Luigi Bersani as \"a stalker\" and a \"dead man talking\" who should have resigned rather than attempted to woo his rivals - as he did last night. Writing on his blog, Grillo reiterated his opposition to any form of formal alliance with Bersani's Democratic Party. Instead, Grillo said, Five Star would only support policies which it agreed with. The news was accompanied with a remarkable graphic of Pier Luigi Bersani presented as a corpse: Click here for Grillo's full statement. Reaction to follow German politician Peer Steinbr\u00fcck has paid a heavy price for joking yesterday that the Italian election had been won by a couple of clowns - Italy's president, Giorgio Napolitano, has cancelled a meeting with him. The rebuke comes after Steinbr\u00fcck's, the SPD's candidate for the chancellorship in this autumn's general election, told voters at an event called Straight Talk with Peer Steinbr\u00fcck that To a certain degree I am appalled that two clowns have won. In fairness to Steinbr\u00fcck, he's not the first person to connect Beppe Grillo's career as a satirist with Silvio Berlusconi's long record of being, well, Silvio Berlusconi - or \"a clown with a testosterone boost\", as he put it. But Napolitano - on a trip to Germany - is most unamused. Der Spiegel has more details. In the UK, one of the Bank of England's deputy governors has tried to shoot down speculation that Britain might experiment with negative interest rates -- a day after a fellow deputy suggested it might. Charlie Bean insisted that the Bank was not about to ask to be paid to hold commercial banks' deposits, despite Paul Tucker hinting that it was under consideration. Speaking at a conference organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs, Bean said: Any suggestion that we have a plan to introduce negative interest rates immediately, I should make absolutely clear, is not the case. The ECB cut its deposit rate to 0.0% last year, in an attempt to get banks to lend. But as our economics correspondent, Phillip Inman, reports, Bean says the Bank of England couldn't easily folow. Bean did his best to demolish the policy, saying it would create huge problems for banks that have tied mortgages to the current bank base rate of 0.5%. \"It has significant negative side-effects which is why I do not support it,\" explained Bean. He pointed out that the European Central Bank has a separate rate for some commercial bank deposits because they are forced to keep particular reserves, whereas UK banks are allowed flexibility. Disaggregating some bank deposits with Threadneedle Street from others would be a minefield, Bean added. I just chatted with economist Shaun Richards, who argued that the ECB's move hadn't worked: Zero rates had zero effect. The ECB cut the deposit rate to zero, and all the money just moved to another account in the ECB. Richards said he wasn't surprised to see Tucker discussing negative rates, given the weak state of the UK economy and the Bank's failure to stimulate output. But he pointed out that previous rate cuts haven't had much effect, and warns that savers would inevitably suffer. Just to be clear, this is different from the Bank of England's base rate, which is at a current record low of 0.5%. Our Q&amp;A explains all.... ...unlike a certain radio station this morning, it seems: Over in Greece, the former mayor of Thessaloniki has been jailed for life after being convicted of stealing almost \u20ac18m from the city. Vassilis Papageorgopoulos was convicted of embezzlement after a trial where four others were also convicted and received lesser sentences, including the municipality's former general secretary, Michalis Lemousias, ex-cashier Panayiotis Saxonis. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: Papageorgopoulos and 17 other officials stood trial for allegedly embezzling almost 52 million euros from the municipality\u2019s coffers, though the Thessaloniki court on Wednesday said that there was proof of 17.962 million euros having been misappropriated by the former mayor and his cohorts. The other 13 officials were acquitted. Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, has joined the ranks of Eurocrats warning Italy that they cannot avoid fiscal consolidation. Speaking after meeting the prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Van Rompuy said the pair had spoken about \" the economic and social situation in Europe\". As I have said before - and others like me - I believe that 2012 marked a turning point in the crisis in the eurozone - and that the worst is now hopefully behind us. But we should not become complacent - neither in Member States nor at the level of the European Union and the eurozone. There is no real alternative to keep up reforming our economies. There is no way back for any of our Member States. There's very little political action to report in Italy yet (where the Pope is making an emotional farewell to huge crowds in the Vatican). But Beppe Grillo's Five Star group are making murmurings about a potential deal with Bersani, it seems: Word from Brussels that the European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, will meet Italy's current prime minister, Mario Monti, to discuss the situation. The news that Italy's much-watched bond sale went smoothly (see 10.24am) has cheered analysts, although some traders are muttering darkly that we don't know who bought the bonds (so perhaps domestic banks mopped most of them up to ease the panic). Nick Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy said the sale had gone \"relatively smoothly\", but warned: The higher yields show that Italian sovereign debt is now caught in a tug-of-war between the reassurance provided by the ECB's fiscal backstop and the confusion and instability in Italian politics. ...While there's still none of the panic of November 2011 or July 2012, sentiment towards Italy has deteriorated markedly since Sunday's inconclusive parliamentary election. Nick Stamenkovic of RIA Capital Markets said the results would generate \"some relief\", with buyers calculating that an Italian government will be carved out, somehow. They got reasonable demand, but clearly investors demanded a higher risk premium to take it down. Demand reflected by the bid/cover ratio suggests that despite the uncertain outlook, investors believe that some sort of a coalition will be cobbled together in coming weeks. And Elisabeth Afseth of Investec agreed that the important point is that the Italian debt management office \"got it done\". The yields are higher than anything they've done for quite some time but that's hardly a big surprise but they got the amount they wanted. But some were more cynical: Breaking: the results of the Italian debt auction are in, and it has gone better than feared. Borrowing costs are up compared with the previous auctions (no surprise there!), but they are not at dangerous levels. And there certainly wasn't a buyer's strike - Italy sold the full \u20ac6.5bn on offer. Here's the details: \u2022 Italy sold \u20ac2.5bn of 5-year bonds at an average yield of 3.59%, up from 2.94% last time. \u2022 It also sold \u20ac4bn of 10-year bonds at an average yield of 4.83%, up from 4.17% And the bid-to-cover ratio (the amount of bids compared to the amount on offer) actually rose, to 1.6, from 1.3 last time. Reaction to follow The better news in today's UK GDP data is that the economy actually grew over the last 12 months. Britain's economy was 0.3% higher than a year ago - not flat as expected. That's because the ONS have revised two other quarters last year. It now thinks GDP in Q1 2012 only fell by -0.1% (from -0.2%), while Q3 2012 GDP is now estimated at +1.0% (from +0.9%). On the one hand, this is much weaker than the UK government had expected (via the independent Office for Budget Responsibility) On the other hand, some eurozone countries would welcome any growth: Despite rumours it would be revised down, UK GDP is unchanged at -0.3% for the last quarter, the ONS just reported. Output data for various sections of the British economy showed that: \u2022 UK services sector shrank by 0.1% in October-December \u2022 Construction output rose by 0.9% \u2022 Industrial output tumbled by 1.9% and manufacturing output by 1.3% -- both the steepest falls since the first quarter of 2009 Rating agency Moody's weighed in on the Italian election deadlock last night, warning that it could downgrade the country's credit rating if a government can't be formed, or if its economic reform agenda now stalls. In a statement, Moody's said: We would consider downgrading Italy's government debt rating in the event of additional material deterioration in the country's economic prospects or difficulties in implementing reform A deterioration in funding conditions as a result of new, substantial domestic economic and financial shocks from the euro area debt crisis would also place downward pressure on Italy's rating. Moody's currently rates Italy just two notches above Junk status, at Baa2. City traders also appear to be taking comfort from US central bank chief Ben Bernanke - who yesterday calmed fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, explains: While Italian political chaos likely to persist as discussions take place on coalition formation, investors still looked to put more onus on US Fed Chairman\u2019s statement that quantitative easing was here to stay. After yesterday's drama, Europe's stock markets are rising in early trading. Italy's FTSE MIB: up 106 points at 15657, + 0.7%, FTSE 100: up 29 points at 6299, + 0.5% German DAX: up 35 points at 7629, +0.4% French CAC: up 24 points at 3646, +0.7% Spanish IBEX: up 64 points at 8044, +0.8% So why the change? One argument is that investors would actually welcome some grit being thrown into the wheels of the eurozone austerity machine. The prospect of a Bersani-Grillo government, providing some stability but less fiscal consolidation, isn't a reason to panic. Investors haven't been demanding that economic growth is choked off recklessly across Europe -- their concern is simply that they get their money back. Or as one London fund manager put it: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis following the dramatic Italian election results, and other key events in the world economy. It never really went away, but there's no doubt that the eurozone crisis is now getting everyone's full attention again. The deadlock in Italy following the weekend's election is a very nasty shock to those who thought the worst was somehow over for Europe. With a majority of voters rejecting the reform plans favoured by the EU, we might be looking at months of drama: As our front page story today declares: Three years of German-led austerity and budget cuts aimed at saving the euro and retooling the European economy was left facing one of its biggest challenges as Italian voters' rejection of spending cuts and tax rises opened up a stark new fissure in European politics. The governing stalemate in Rome and the vote in the general election \u2013 by a factor of three to two \u2013 against the austerity policies pursued by Italy's humiliated caretaker prime minister, Mario Monti, meant that the spending cuts and tax rises dictated by the eurozone would grind to a halt, risking a re-eruption of the euro crisis after six months of relative stability. That was yesterday. Now, Italy's first challenge is to sell up to \u20ac6.5bn of long-term government bonds this morning. Investors are certain to demand a higher rate of return, with Italy's future so uncertain. How much higher (and how many bond traders take part), will show how nervous the markets are today. And the big question remains - who will govern Italy? Last night Pier Luigi Bersani threw down a challenge to Beppe Grillo and his Five Star Movement (M5S) -- you've won influence, now use it. As John Hooper reported from Rome: At a press conference in Rome, a weary-looking Bersani said it was time for the upstart movement to do something more than just demand the removal of Italy's mainstream politicians. \"Up to now, they have been saying: 'All go home.' But now they're here, too. So either they go home as well, or they say what they want to do for their country and their children.\" Such an alliance would scupper the Grand Coalition favoured by Silvio Berlusconi. Your move, Beppe. We'll be watching all the latest political and financial developments through the day....",

We are fully aware of the human dimension that lies behind it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi cited the record youth unemployment levels -- more than half of young people in Greece and Spain are out of work. That is unfair, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Is that fair, that as a result, this generation has to bear the bulk of the burden in the downturn? That's why I say that reforms that make economies work better also make them fairer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi has previously argued that 'structural' problems with Europe's economies have worsened the impact of the crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2013/html/sp130227_2.en.html\">The full speech is online here:</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-512e5ff195cbda883f39810a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-27T19:45:16.111Z\">7.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Why Italian instability could last a year</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here's some analysis of the political situation in Italy tonight from <a href=\"http://albertonardelli.tumblr.com/\">Alberto Nardelli:</a></strong></p> <p>He explains that <strong>Beppe Grillo</strong>'s decision to refuse to form an alliance with the centre-left Democratic Party (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/27/eurozone-crisis-italy-elections-bond-auction#block-512e395db579df9a524a388c\">read it at 4.50pm</a>) isn't a surprise, but it is very significant.</p> <p><strong>It effectively sinks Pier Luigi Bersani's chances of running a minority government.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An abstention in Italy\u2019s Senate in a confidence vote would be akin to a no-vote, meaning a Bersani government wouldn\u2019t have the majority required to install a government. Italy\u2019s President, Napolitano, is unlikely to send Bersani to parliament to seek a confidence vote unless he believes there is a majority.</p> </blockquote> <p>Alberto also believes that Silvio Berlusconi is waiting for Bersani to cave in and seek a grand coalition. Today's video statement (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/27/eurozone-crisis-italy-elections-bond-auction#block-512e4d2db579df9a524a389c\">see 6.15pm</a>) shows that Berlusconi wants a deal on tax cuts and institutional&#xa0;reforms.</p> <p>And his conclusion is that we are unlikely to get new elections, if needed, within the next six months, because:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>1)</strong> the new parliament sits in 2-3 weeks, and needs to elect presidents for each chamber, and parliamentary groups need to be formed.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> President Napolitano consults with all stakeholders - presidents of the chambers, parliamentary groups and parties to explore if there is a parliamentary majority around a potential government/s.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> whatever happens, the current president\u2019s terms is ending and Napolitano cannot dissolve parliament and call new elections - parliament needs to elect a new president.</p> <p><strong>4)</strong> internal party dynamics - should Bersani be unable to form a government and new elections needed it is unlikely Bersani would lead the PD into these elections - this means: party congress, primaries, selection of candidates etc. The same on the centre-right - would Berlusconi stand again?

Its broad theme is that from 2010 to 2012 the markets acted irrationally, recklessly ditching sovereign debt, and forcing painful, unnecessary and self-defeating cutbacks and tax rises on swathes of Southern Europe.</p> <p>Well, here's a flavour of the counter-argument:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Panic is a funny word. Jumping out of a moving bus can look like panic. However, if the driver \u2013 let\u2019s call him Jean-Claude \u2013 is absolutely adamant that he wants to drive said bus off a cliff (think of M. Trichet\u2019s threats to pull the repo-able status of Greek debt and later refusal to allow the ECB to get involved in a rescue), and the conductor (Wolfgang) is similarly vehement about fiscal assistance \u2013 jumping out starts to look quite rational.</p> <p>The ECB (especially) and the core countries spent most of 2010-mid-2012 declaring an absolute refusal to assist the peripheral nations. As a result, Europe\u2019s money supply began to resemble a badly-sloping field, where all the liquidity is drained from one end (the periphery) and swamps the core.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-66fa1397-1ffe-4bc7-ad20-0e1b7d7e6071\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/27/1361992387784/-460x279.png\" alt=\"Pawelmorski's blog\" width=\"460\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank deposit data</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That changed when the <strong>European Central Bank</strong> finally took bold sweeping steps last summer, at which point the governments of Spain and Italy saw their borrowing costs fall to safer levels.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this case, blaming the markets actually is therefore blaming the alarm for the fire, and measures to control spread volatility like measures to prevent fire casualties by removing the alarms.</p> </blockquote> <p>The point is that the recent recovery in market optimism has been driven by the actions of central bankers like Mario Draghi - not ever-deeper fiscal cutbacks.</p> <p><a href=\"http://pawelmorski.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/government-bond-markets-unfeeling-psychopaths-or-rational-keynesians/\">More here</a>.

      "bodyText": "The insurance tycoon Peter Wood is looking forward to a cash windfall of about \u00a3175m as he prepares to sell over a third of his \u00a3500m stake in the Esure business he founded 13 years ago in a stock market flotation. The move comes only three years after Wood led a management buyout at Esure, buying out a 70% stake held by taxpayer-backed Lloyds Banking Group in a deal which valued the insurer at just \u00a3260m. The business is best known for producing jingle and catchphrase-heavy TV adverts for its brands Sheila's Wheels and Esure, and its joint venture Go Compare. The Esure brand used the late Michael Winner delivering the punchline: \"Calm down dear, it's only a commercial.\" Wood has led the business from its inception in 2000, when he set up the company backed by the Halifax. The insurer grew to 1.8 million motor and home policyholders but was a forced sale in the wake of the rescue merger of HBOS with Lloyds \u2013 a taxpayer-backed bail-out deal. Wood led a management buyout from Lloyds with backing from Tosca Penta Capital, a fund managed by Penta Capital. The deal saw Wood and Tosca Penta pay about \u00a3190m to acquire Lloyds' 70%. The balance was already controlled by Wood and his management team. Wood, who currently holds a stake of almost 50% in Esure, told the Guardian he expects to cut his interest to close to 30%. \"I will still be the largest shareholder by far, with about 30% \u2013 probably a bit higher.\" Under listing rules he is barred from discussing likely float valuation, but it is thought Wood's sale of an interest of between 15% and 20% should deliver a windfall of about \u00a3175m if the listing achieves a hoped-for \u00a31bn valuation. The Esure founder said he intends to remain at Esure as executive chairman for the long term. \"This is my seventh insurer \u2013 and my last. I will be here for as long as I can make a contribution. Or until Stuart [Vann, chief executive] taps me on the shoulder and says: 'Time for a bit more golf.' '' Wood has committed not to further sell down his interest for at least a year after the float. Tosca Penta is expected to use the float as a chance to sell a larger proportion of shareholding of just over 40%. With the addition of \u00a350m in new shares being issued, the free float for Esure is expected to be between \u00a3400m and \u00a3550m. The float of Esure will be the largest so far this year, almost double the size of housebuilder Crest Nicholson. Previous reports had suggested Wood and Tosca Penta were looking to raise about \u00a3300m from share sales. But pre-float filings by the company suggest the selloff is expected to net them between \u00a3350m and \u00a3500m. Some reports have suggested that unnamed institutional investors are unhappy with the valuation Esure is seeking \u2014 though these concerns were voiced before the insurer's announcement yesterday of a trading profit for last year up 60% to \u00a3138m. Wood made his first fortune founding the Direct Line insurance business in 1985 in conjunction with Royal Bank of Scotland. He left the business after a falling out with the bank but went on to found Esure. He has also founded insurance businesses in Spain and the US and last year the Sunday TImes Rich List estimated his personal fortune at \u00a3500m. Among his holdings outside the insurance industry is a significant stake in model train and Scalextric group Hornby. Direct Line was itself floated last October, valuing the business at \u00a32.6bn. Since then shares have risen 17%.",

It is thanks to him we have endured Michael Winner's \"Calm down dear\" ads, the beehive-haired singing trio in a Sheila's Wheels pink Cadillac, and the car-horn jingle from Direct Line's red telephone-on-wheels. As if these were not offence enough, Esure's joint venture price comparison business Go Compare has given viewers the fictional Italian tenor Gio Compario.

Multi-millionaire Wood, has always refused to hire a marketing director \u2013 both at Esure and at his earlier business Direct Line \u2013 and has personally taken charge of publicity campaigns for almost all his career. In the late 1980s, working with advertising experts Sian Vickers and Chris Wilkins, Wood hammered home the arrival of Britain's first telephone-only insurer, with the creation of Direct Line's speeding red phone on wheels. Three years later he started Esure and the adverts, this time fronted by the late Michael Winner, gave the restaurant critic and film director his \"calm down dear, it's only a commercial\" catch phrase. Winner had become the face of the brand after ringing his friend Wood to complain about the standard of previous adverts, and insisting he could do much better. It was not the first time the Death Wish director had rung Wood to gripe. The two men had become friends after the notorious curmudgeon had demanded call centre staff put him through to the boss of Direct Line.It was not until Wood threatened to cancel Winner's policy that the restaurant critic withdrew the complaint and suggested they settle the matter over a lunch \u2013 leading to a long friendship. Winner was dropped for a spell by Esure in favour of an animated mouse on wheels. However, that campaign was successfully challenged in the courts by RBS, which argued it breached trademark protections and was too similar to the Direct Line wheeled phone. Winner was re-hired. According to Esure, Winner, who passed away last month, at one stage wrote to Wood expressing his wish that his \"Calm down dear\" adverts carry on being aired after his death.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England might be known as the old lady of Threadneedle Street \u2013 but she has a very masculine face. From the Bank's governor Sir Mervyn King and his three deputies, to the nine-strong monetary policy committee that sets interest rates and the new 11-strong financial policy committee charged with avoiding another blow up in the banking system \u2013 all the posts are held by men. The Bank's court of directors, whose job is to manage the bank, is just a tad more enlightened \u2013 there is a woman among the 12 grandees who meet seven times a year. Just one. But the Bank is keen to dispel any suggestions that it is a crusty old gentleman's club, pointing out that nearly a third of middle and senior management jobs at the Bank are now held by women \u2013 up 50% on a decade ago. In the financial stability unit \u2013 whose job is to ensure there will never be a repeat of the 2008 financial crash \u2013 two of the six divisional heads are women. . The Bank is aware of its image problem. A women's network was set up in 2007 and Sarah Breeden, now one of the two bosses in financial stability, was asked to take a role co-chairing the network. The other divisional head is Victoria Saporta, who runs the 30-strong prudential policy division and is an expert in the amount of capital big banks should be forced to hold. Breeden, 44, is now head of the Bank's risk assessment division, charged with looking for the unknown unknowns \u2013 the ticking time bombs outside the banking industry that no one has considered might be a problem. She is new to this job, previously held by Niki Anderson, 42, who is also one of the Bank's most senior executives and is now a special adviser on financial stability. All three are long-standing employees of the Bank and played key roles during the banking crisis. Greek-born Saporta, 43, returned from a year-long maternity leave just days before the first signs of the 2007 credit crunch \u2013 which sparked the run on Northern Rock \u2013 and went on to become a key figure in devising the amount of capital banks should hold. She was seconded to the Cabinet Office when the G20 was held in London in 2009. Breeden was hand-picked by the governor to run the team that tackled the Northern Rock crisis while Anderson's role was to work out which banks and building societies might fail next. \"It was unrelenting, for about six months,\" she recalls. \"It was every single weekend. If we weren't trying to get more information about what would happen, we had to write systemic impact reports. We became BlackBerry junkies overnight.\" She was on the fateful conference call in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers was allowed to collapse rather than be rescued by Barclays. Coming up through the ranks is Lauren Anderson, an American lawyer who joined the Bank in 2011 after working on US bank failures and is now a senior manager in the special resolution unit, whose job is to devise plans to ensure that if and when banks fail in the future they do not bring down the financial system with them. \"It is the most interesting work,\" she says. \"When things go terribly wrong, we're the ones who go in and fix it and make sure people have access to their money on a Monday morning. That's a pretty amazing job to have.\" Breeden, who has been at the Bank since 1991, admits that she asked for 24 hours to think before accepting the job when the governor personally asked her to take charge of the team involved in Northern Rock . \"I wanted to make sure that I knew what the job involved. I knew it was important and I didn't want to mess it up,\" says Breeden, who ended up working on the Northern Rock crisis for five months until it was nationalised five years ago this month. She then took a month off with her husband and two children, now seven and 10, before coming back to develop what was to become the special liquidity scheme, a kind of emergency slush fund for banks, and later helped devise the new regulatory regime, which will see the Bank once again policing the insurance and banking businesses. The banking crisis meant long and intense working hours, but Niki Anderson said the experience has had a long-lasting effect. \"I work 50% more effectively,\" she says. When she started at the bank, King was chief economist and keen for information on inflation expectations, so she devised a model which uses government bond yield curves \u2013 an indication of a price a government pays to borrow \u2013 to measure inflation expectations. Twice she has been tempted away from the Bank, once to work for a hedge fund and then for an investment bank. \"I wasn't sure if my career was going to go anywhere. I perceived a bit of a glass ceiling,\" she says. But she returned both times, admitting that the private sector was not as rewarding. This is also what keeps Breeden at the bank. \"What we do ... matters. The judgments that we make and the analysis we do really matter for everybody out there,\" she says. They could earn more in the City. Saporta is aware of this as manager of a 30-strong department: \"What keeps them here is a commitment to public policy. You have to keep them motivated given there is a big opportunity cost in staying on.\" Women made up 43% of graduates recruited into permanent jobs at the Bank last year, up from 29% in 2011, and the Bank recently won an award for the public-sector employer doing the most to create a pipeline of female leaders of the future. King's successor \u2013 Bank of Canada boss Mark Carney \u2013 takes over from him in the summer and will serve for five years. Time enough, possibly, for the old lady to find a female face?",

The proceeds will be used to fund the purchase of the Midsummer Place shopping centre in Milton Keynes, but with a flat dividend announcement, its shares fell 9p to 333.9p.</p> <p>Overall though the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 55.44 points higher at 6325.88. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> The equity markets have by no means forgotten yesterday's sell off but they have found some solace today as an Italian bond auction saw the country's borrowing costs decline from Tuesday's spike. Some strong demand for Italy's debt has shown that investors have not given up on the chances of normalisation even in the aftermath of a disastrous election. If there's one thing that investors have learnt in the past couple of years it's that there's very strong political will to see the eurozone succeed and the central bank is always on hand to step in if things start to wobble. <br> Investors are also enjoying the resilience shown by US markets that have been boosted once again by strong economic data from across the pond. The sell off so far this week looks like it could be over as soon as it started. </blockquote> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> added 3.2p to 165.1p on talk it may curtail its European acquisition plans.</p> <p>The company has reportedly been considering a \u00a36bn or so offer for Kabel Deutschland but Bloomberg reported Vodafone had suspended the idea. However it went on to say an offer could still be made at some point.</p> <p>Meanwhile JP Morgan issued a note this week saying that a merger spree would not necessarily be the only way for the mobile phone group to expand. It said:</p> <blockquote> The emerging theme of fixed-mobile convergence has highlighted a potential structural disadvantage of being mobile-only, raising concerns Vodafone will now embark on a pan-European fixed-line M&amp;A spree. This assessment is overly simplistic in our view. A potential Kabel Deutschland deal is not primarily driven by convergence, but reflects growth attractions and a significant synergy opportunity. Across the rest of Europe, we see many (superior) alternatives to M&amp;A as Vodafone seeks to expand its fixed-line capabilities. <br> [This is] our preferred strategy by markets: Spain: A fibre joint venture with Orange or a joint venture/wholesale deal with ONO. Italy: A joint venture with Fastweb. UK: Organic strategy leveraging the Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide acquisition. Netherlands: Fibre wholesale. </blockquote> <p>Among a host of companies reporting results, <strong>Weir</strong> rose158p to \u00a323.22 after the engineering group reported a 12% rise in full year profits, boosted by strong demand for its pumps from mining companies but a weaker performance in oil and gas. Analyst Thomas Rands at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Lower than expected revenues, mainly due to lower oil and gas, were offset by good operating margin progression due to a higher percentage of aftermarket revenues. The outlook for 2013 is cautious with guidance for low single digit revenue growth and stable margins. As such we are likely to trim our operational forecasts by 2%-3%. We put our 2,250p target price and buy recommendation under review. <br> In our opinion, the stock has done enough for the time being until clear direction is seen. The significant short position could cause further volatility. </blockquote> <p>British Gas-owner <strong>Centrica</strong> closed 1.3p lower at 347.8p despite a 9% rise in profits, but its former associate<strong> BG </strong>added 16.5p to 1163.5p on hopes for its Brazilian business after Royal Dutch Shell paid $4.4bn for assets in the area. Andrew Whittock at Liberum Capital said:</p> <blockquote> The market may look for a read through to the value of BG's LNG business. The characteristics of the assets acquired are not obviously a good comparator but (very rough and ready) Shell appears to have paid around 10 times 2012 estimated earnings before interest and tax \u2013 we value BG's LNG business on around 6 times so [this] could be positive. <br> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps, the prospect of breaking into the New Jersey online gaming market sent shares in <strong>Bwin.partydigital </strong>soaring.</p> <p>The state governor has just signed a bill legalising online betting after the local assembly and senate both voted in favour. The law will permit existing casinos to offer licensed games on the internet, including casino games, poker and bingo, and will require renewal in parliament after 10 years.</p> <p>Analysts at Daniel Stewart estimate the New Jersey market could be worth at least $450m, and Bwin already has a agreement which could give it access.</p> <p>Bwin closed 12.2p higher at 150p while rival <strong>888</strong> - which could also benefit - added 6.5p to 156.75p.</p> <p><strong>Homeserve</strong>, the insurer and boiler repair group, is still awaiting the outcome of an FSA investigation into misselling allegations, which led to the company <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/nov/20/homeserve-regulator-probe-overseas\" title=\"\">cutting its UK operations while trying to grow overseas</a>.</p> <p>It said in early February that the regulatory probe was likely to continue for a number of months yet, but in the meantime it had been re-contacting customers who \"may have suffered detriment as a result of the way in which they were sold their policy.\"</p> <p>Now its new strategy has been called into question by analysts at Espirito Santo who have moved their recommendation from buy to sell. Espirito's David Brockton said:</p> <blockquote> It has become increasingly clear to us that Homeserve's new marketing is much less effective than we had hoped. We change our UK forecasts to reflect lower policy sales. We also reduce our international forecasts to reflect greater marketing spend in the US and weaker growth in France. <br> Together these changes dent our confidence in the investment case, contributing to earnings per share downgrades of 4% and 12% for 2014 and 2015 respectively. As a result, even with a favourable conclusion to the current FSA investigation, we now expect the shares to underperform. We reduce our fair value from 288p to 210p and downgrade from to sell. </blockquote> <p>The news helped send Homeserve 3.9p lower to 237.8p.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Dixons Retail </strong>has added 0.21p to 26.58p after closing its struggling Pixmania stores in Europe. Espirito Santo said the move came sooner than forecast:</p> <blockquote> Given a sooner-than-expected resolution in Western Europe and the bearish \"worst-case\" numbers management has highlighted as the potential cash cost of closing other businesses, news flow from the company should become incrementally positive now. </blockquote>",

The company has reportedly been considering a \u00a36bn or so offer for Kabel Deutschland but Bloomberg reported Vodafone had suspended the idea. However it went on to say an offer could still be made at some point. Meanwhile JP Morgan issued a note this week saying that a merger spree would not necessarily be the only way for the mobile phone group to expand. It said: The emerging theme of fixed-mobile convergence has highlighted a potential structural disadvantage of being mobile-only, raising concerns Vodafone will now embark on a pan-European fixed-line M&amp;A spree. This assessment is overly simplistic in our view. A potential Kabel Deutschland deal is not primarily driven by convergence, but reflects growth attractions and a significant synergy opportunity. Across the rest of Europe, we see many (superior) alternatives to M&amp;A as Vodafone seeks to expand its fixed-line capabilities. [This is] our preferred strategy by markets: Spain: A fibre joint venture with Orange or a joint venture/wholesale deal with ONO. Italy: A joint venture with Fastweb. UK: Organic strategy leveraging the Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide acquisition. Netherlands: Fibre wholesale. Among a host of companies reporting results, Weir rose158p to \u00a323.22 after the engineering group reported a 12% rise in full year profits, boosted by strong demand for its pumps from mining companies but a weaker performance in oil and gas. Analyst Thomas Rands at Investec said: Lower than expected revenues, mainly due to lower oil and gas, were offset by good operating margin progression due to a higher percentage of aftermarket revenues. The outlook for 2013 is cautious with guidance for low single digit revenue growth and stable margins. As such we are likely to trim our operational forecasts by 2%-3%. We put our 2,250p target price and buy recommendation under review. In our opinion, the stock has done enough for the time being until clear direction is seen. The significant short position could cause further volatility. British Gas-owner Centrica closed 1.3p lower at 347.8p despite a 9% rise in profits, but its former associate BG added 16.5p to 1163.5p on hopes for its Brazilian business after Royal Dutch Shell paid $4.4bn for assets in the area. Andrew Whittock at Liberum Capital said: The market may look for a read through to the value of BG's LNG business. The characteristics of the assets acquired are not obviously a good comparator but (very rough and ready) Shell appears to have paid around 10 times 2012 estimated earnings before interest and tax \u2013 we value BG's LNG business on around 6 times so [this] could be positive. Among the mid-caps, the prospect of breaking into the New Jersey online gaming market sent shares in Bwin.partydigital soaring. The state governor has just signed a bill legalising online betting after the local assembly and senate both voted in favour. The law will permit existing casinos to offer licensed games on the internet, including casino games, poker and bingo, and will require renewal in parliament after 10 years. Analysts at Daniel Stewart estimate the New Jersey market could be worth at least $450m, and Bwin already has a agreement which could give it access. Bwin closed 12.2p higher at 150p while rival 888 - which could also benefit - added 6.5p to 156.75p. Homeserve, the insurer and boiler repair group, is still awaiting the outcome of an FSA investigation into misselling allegations, which led to the company cutting its UK operations while trying to grow overseas. It said in early February that the regulatory probe was likely to continue for a number of months yet, but in the meantime it had been re-contacting customers who \"may have suffered detriment as a result of the way in which they were sold their policy.\" Now its new strategy has been called into question by analysts at Espirito Santo who have moved their recommendation from buy to sell. Espirito's David Brockton said: It has become increasingly clear to us that Homeserve's new marketing is much less effective than we had hoped. We change our UK forecasts to reflect lower policy sales. We also reduce our international forecasts to reflect greater marketing spend in the US and weaker growth in France. Together these changes dent our confidence in the investment case, contributing to earnings per share downgrades of 4% and 12% for 2014 and 2015 respectively. As a result, even with a favourable conclusion to the current FSA investigation, we now expect the shares to underperform. We reduce our fair value from 288p to 210p and downgrade from to sell. The news helped send Homeserve 3.9p lower to 237.8p. Finally Dixons Retail has added 0.21p to 26.58p after closing its struggling Pixmania stores in Europe. Espirito Santo said the move came sooner than forecast: Given a sooner-than-expected resolution in Western Europe and the bearish \"worst-case\" numbers management has highlighted as the potential cash cost of closing other businesses, news flow from the company should become incrementally positive now.",

The broker's Michael Campbell said:</p> <blockquote> This [news] means that we realistically will see a functioning online gambling market in New Jersey before the end of 2013. Bwin has a B2B agreement with MGM and Boyd Gaming which we believe own Borgata in Atlantic City which will in our view give [the company] access to the New Jersey market through this agreement. <br> New Jersey could be a $450m market and larger if sports betting is allowed online and within state borders. Securing a decent slice of this market would be a significant addition to profits for operators and technology providers in our view. Furthermore the earnings derived from this market in our view should demand a high multiple for fully regulated and taxed earnings.  As are result of the bill being signed into law we are reinstating our buy recommendation on Bwin, with a target price of 173p. However German exposure in our view is likely to cause further volatility to the share price. </blockquote> <p>Morgan Stanley was also positive on the news, raising its target price for Bwin from 160p to 200p and for rival <strong>888 </strong>from 140p to 175p. Analyst Vaughan Lewis said:</p> <blockquote> New laws in New Jersey mean online gambling should launch in 9-12 months. We think 888 and Bwin.party will be among the winners here, and increase our 2015 earnings per share forecasts by 24% for 888 and 5% for Bwin.party. Longer-term implications are more positive, as the world's largest gambling market opens. <br> We expect European operators to be involved as suppliers and partners. The law restricts the online gambling market to the 8 existing casino licensees. With limited operational knowledge in the US, we expect most operators to enter into partnerships and software agreements. This should benefit industry leaders with proprietary technology, such as Bwin.party and 888.  New Jersey is small\u2026but the longer-term impact could be significant.

The broker's Michael Campbell said: This [news] means that we realistically will see a functioning online gambling market in New Jersey before the end of 2013. Bwin has a B2B agreement with MGM and Boyd Gaming which we believe own Borgata in Atlantic City which will in our view give [the company] access to the New Jersey market through this agreement. New Jersey could be a $450m market and larger if sports betting is allowed online and within state borders. Securing a decent slice of this market would be a significant addition to profits for operators and technology providers in our view. Furthermore the earnings derived from this market in our view should demand a high multiple for fully regulated and taxed earnings. As are result of the bill being signed into law we are reinstating our buy recommendation on Bwin, with a target price of 173p. However German exposure in our view is likely to cause further volatility to the share price. Morgan Stanley was also positive on the news, raising its target price for Bwin from 160p to 200p and for rival 888 from 140p to 175p. Analyst Vaughan Lewis said: New laws in New Jersey mean online gambling should launch in 9-12 months. We think 888 and Bwin.party will be among the winners here, and increase our 2015 earnings per share forecasts by 24% for 888 and 5% for Bwin.party. Longer-term implications are more positive, as the world's largest gambling market opens. We expect European operators to be involved as suppliers and partners. The law restricts the online gambling market to the 8 existing casino licensees. With limited operational knowledge in the US, we expect most operators to enter into partnerships and software agreements. This should benefit industry leaders with proprietary technology, such as Bwin.party and 888. New Jersey is small\u2026but the longer-term impact could be significant. The US is the largest single gambling market in the world, and we see long-term potential worth up to 460p per share for 888 and 560p per share for Bwin.party. Bwin shares have jumped 17.6p to 155.4p, a near 13% rise, while 888 is up 9.25p to 159.5p.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Phil Bentley, the managing director of British Gas, formally announced his decision to leave on Wednesday as the company risked fresh anger from consumer groups by reporting an 11% increase in annual profits to over \u00a3600m, aided by domestic price rises. The 54-year-old former BP executive who has been at the centre of rows over the scale of Big Six energy company earnings, will exit with a combined share, salary and pension package worth more than \u00a310m. He says he wants to go on and become a chief executive elsewhere but will be able to retire in four years time with an annual pension of \u00a3225,000 after working for British Gas for little over 12 years. A formal statement from British Gas's parent group, Centrica, paid tribute to his role in \"profit improvement\" at the UK's largest domestic energy supplier. \"In his most recent role he [Bentley] has been instrumental in restructuring, reinvigorating and materially improving the performance of the business by raising customer service standards, lowering costs, increasing productivity and creating significant value from profit improvement,\" said the Centrica statement. The well-signalled decision came as the wider Centrica group reported operating profits of \u00a32.7bn \u2013 up 14% and announced plans to spend \u00a3500m buying back shares while raising the dividend 5% to 16.4p. Nick Luff, the finance director, said it was fair to give back cash to investors given Centrica had raised \u00a32bn for funding nuclear power stations, plans which have now been dropped. He dismissed the suggestion the cash should be invested in operations pointing out the company was already spending \u00a32.7bn a year building new offshore gas supplies and wind farms. Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, defended the profits at British Gas and the wider group saying they contributed to jobs and tax take. \"It's important that Centrica makes a fair and reasonable return so that we can continue to make our contribution to society and to invest. Last year we incurred a tax charge of over \u00a31bn and invested over \u00a32bn to secure new sources of energy for the UK, well in excess of our profits.\" Centrica said it was going to put more emphasis on its growing business in North America. It hinted that it may invest in cheap shale gas production there which could eventually be exported to Britain to supply UK homes. British Gas raised its gas and electricity prices this winter by 6%. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch, predicted that Wednesday's profit rises would grate with some customers. \"Yes, there is a huge amount of investment required to keep the lights on over the next 10 years, but there has to be a balance between energy companies making healthy profits and people going cold for fear of the cost of turning their heating on. While British Gas makes a strong case about future investment, jobs and security, I suspect there will be little sympathy, especially amongst those who have shivered at home this winter,\" Robinson said.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England considers negative interest scheme for high-street banks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A top Bank of England policymaker hinted on Tuesday that the central bank was considering charging high-street banks a negative interest rate in a desperate move to encourage more lending to small businesses. This would mean banks being charged to hold deposits with the Bank of England, encouraging them to lend more of their funds to the private sector. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury select committee, deputy governor Paul Tucker said he was prepared to consider \"extraordinary\" policies after it became clear that current schemes were failing to spur lending to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). The plan would involve Threadneedle Street setting up a separate interest rate just for banks, leaving base rates, which provide the basis for mortgages and savings rates, untouched. The European Central Bank has maintained a separate bank rate since its inception to manipulate bank lending behaviour. Tucker admitted that cheap loans directly funded by the central bank were failing to reach small businesses, undermining a key policy to drive growth. He said successive schemes designed to boost lending to small businesses had failed to reach their target after the majority of loans offered as part of the central bank's \u00a380bn funding for lending scheme went to homebuyers. Tucker, who lost out to the Canadian Mark Carney in the race to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank, said he favoured a plan to encourage major corporations, which are flush with cash, to offer loans in partnership with the central bank to bypass the ailing banking sector. \"I am worried, and this is a personal opinion, that the current battery of credit policies are not reaching small and medium-sized businesses at the moment,\" he said. Adding that he was sceptical that it would be a quick fix, he said: \"I hope that we will think about the constraints of setting negative interest rates. This would be an extraordinary thing to do and it needs to be thought through carefully.\" Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, said: \"The lack of lending to SMEs is inhibiting economic growth in the UK. The MPC is right to be looking at additional tools, or changes to existing tools, that could help.\" Ray Boulger of mortgage adviser John Charcol said negative interest rates would result in losses for banks that kept money on deposit with the Bank of England, increasing the pressure to lend to private borrowers. He said the mortgage market would be a major beneficiary: \"This increases the likelihood of genuine cuts in two-year fixed rates, with the scope for more cuts in longer-term rates as well.\" Analysts likened the discussion about negative interest rates inside the Bank of England to blue-sky thinking and said any action was likely to come long after members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) had considered injecting further funds into the economy through the central bank's policy of quantitative easing (QE). Tucker said: \"I remain open to doing more QE, depending on the outlook for demand and inflation. \"Nobody on the committee thinks that QE has reached the end of the road and that it is not a useful instrument any more. We stand prepared to do more, if we judge that necessary.\" Challenging critics of QE, Tucker said the MPC believed it continued to benefit the economy and without it lending would be more restricted. \"We are absolutely committed to supporting growth within the constraints of keeping inflation to its medium-term target,\" he said. David Miles, a former City economist and external member of the MPC, told MPs he was prepared to allow inflation to rise further above its 2% target to support growth, though it was his view that prices would be unaffected by a boost to QE. In the US, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke strongly defended the Fed's own QE programme, which he said had been essential for the stock market's recovery. \"To this point, we do not see the potential costs of the increased risk-taking in some financial markets as outweighing the benefits of promoting a stronger economic recovery and more rapid job creation,\" Bernanke told the Senate banking committee. The Fed is buying $85bn (\u00a356bn) in bonds each month and has said it plans to continue until it sees a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labour market. The Bank of England has pumped \u00a3375bn into the financial system over the last four years through QE and there is a growing expectation that the MPC will increase the amount to \u00a3400bn sometime in the spring. At the last meeting, three MPC members, including King, voted to increase QE by \u00a325bn. Most UK economic indicators have turned south in recent weeks, wiping out hopes that the UK would recover strongly after four years of intermittent low growth and recession. Many City economists believe the UK will avoid a triple-dip recession despite a 0.3% contraction in the last three months of 2012, though growth will remain weak.",

We stand prepared to do more, if we judge that necessary.\"</p> <p>Challenging critics of QE, Tucker said the MPC believed it continued to benefit the economy and without it lending would be more restricted. \"We are absolutely committed to supporting growth within the constraints of keeping inflation to its medium-term target,\" he said.</p> <p>David Miles, a former City economist and external member of the MPC, told MPs he was prepared to allow inflation to rise further above its 2% target to support growth, though it was his view that prices would be unaffected by a boost to QE.</p> <p>In the US, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke strongly defended the Fed's own QE programme, which he said had been essential for the stock market's recovery. \"To this point, we do not see the potential costs of the increased risk-taking in some financial markets as outweighing the benefits of promoting a stronger economic recovery and more rapid job creation,\" Bernanke told the Senate banking committee.</p> <p>The Fed is buying $85bn (\u00a356bn) in bonds each month and has said it plans to continue until it sees a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labour market.</p> <p>The Bank of England has pumped \u00a3375bn into the financial system over the last four years through QE and there is a growing expectation that the MPC will increase the amount to \u00a3400bn sometime in the spring. At the last meeting, three MPC members, including King, voted to increase QE by \u00a325bn.</p> <p>Most UK economic indicators have turned south in recent weeks, wiping out hopes that the UK would recover strongly after four years of intermittent low growth and recession. Many City economists believe the UK will avoid a triple-dip recession despite a 0.3% contraction in the last three months of 2012, though growth will remain weak.</p>",
