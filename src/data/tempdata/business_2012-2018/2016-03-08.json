      "bodyText": "Mark Carney is not very skilled at sounding neutral. The governor of the Bank of England enraged Brexit-ers in his testimony before the Treasury select committee on Tuesday. He called a transition out of the EU in the event of a leave vote \u201cthe biggest domestic risk to financial stability\u201d. He mused that UK assets could be perceived by foreign investors as more risky. And he added that some parts of the financial services industry could relocate. All of this, admittedly, will be music to the ears of the remain camp. But, come on, the governor is paid to worry about financial stability. It would be odd if Carney didn\u2019t have something to say about the potential consequences of leaving the EU. If you listened to his words \u2013 as opposed to the reaction to them \u2013 the governor stayed well within neutral territory. The \u201cbiggest domestic risk\u201d line may sound dramatic but isn\u2019t. The UK is running a yawning deficit in its current account of 4%, which will not have gone unnoticed by the currency markets. It is quite possible that foreign lenders and investors \u2013 initially, at least \u2013 could demand a higher rate of return on their UK assets. Of course, nobody really knows how the financial markets would react, but Carney\u2019s broad-brush picture hardly counts as scaremongering. Even half the leave camp concedes that exit could be bumpy in the short term; its view is that the bumps will lead to greater long-term prosperity, which is a perfectly respectable argument. As for Carney\u2019s remarks on foreign banks and financial firms leaving the UK, well, that is just what some of them have said. It is not a revelation. The only part where Carney\u2019s neutrality could be questioned was in his remarks on the prime minister\u2019s renegotiation settlement. The governor said the Bank\u2019s concerns about protections for non-members of the eurozone had been addressed and the central bank would continue to have sufficient powers to do its job. There are reasons to quibble with that analysis because we don\u2019t exactly know what panicky measures the eurozone members would introduce in their next crisis. But Carney shouldn\u2019t be damned for offering his opinion. A cannier operator \u2013 such as predecessor Lord King, perhaps \u2013 would have found time for a robust passage on the inherent design flaws in the euro. That might have softened some of the Eurosceptics\u2019 criticism. But on the central allegation of loss of neutrality, the governor said nothing out of order. Carney is innocent. Banking Standards Board should invest in some opinions If you call yourself the Banking Standards Board, surely you should have a few standards. And, one would hope, such an organisation would be able to form an opinion on whether the bankers are improving their behaviour or merely talking about it. Do not read the BSB\u2019s first annual review for insights. This curious document appears to be an exercise in stating the bleedin\u2019 obvious and then offering inoffensive conclusions. Take the passage on incentives and rewards, one of six areas where the BSB is supposedly having a good root around. It starts by telling us what we already know (\u201cfirms have been adapting to and implementing a wide range of national and global regulatory initiatives\u201d) and finishes with the banal statement that \u201cif a remuneration committee does not factor culture into its thinking, culture is unlikely to be intrinsic to the way that a firm pursues its business\u201d. What use is that? Does the BSB, and its chair Dame Colette Bowe, think parts of the banking industry are still polluted by a culture of personal greed? Indeed, did she ever think that? It\u2019s impossible to tell. Being overly generous, one could say these are still early days for the BSB, a body established last year on the recommendation of a parliamentary commission after the market-rigging scandals. The actual standards are promised to appear some time this year. But the work of establishing credibility needs to start now. The BSB was set up by the big banks, has no statutory powers and membership is voluntary. As such, it will always be open to the charge that its thinking is infected by the banks themselves. The only way to counter that perception, and advance the goal of restoring \u201ctrust\u201d, is to avoid platitudes and cause some embarrassment where it is deserved. Bowe needs to acquire some arrows \u2013 and then fire them. US justice department fines have to dent VW Here comes Volkswagen\u2019s plea for mercy. Jobs will have to be cut \u2013 in the US as well as Europe \u2013 if the fines for manipulating diesel emissions tests are too heavy, say the carmaker\u2019s executives. Such a script is very likely. The US Department for Justice is suing VW for up to $46bn (\u00a332.3bn), which is serious money. Actual fines, of course, would probably be substantially lower but could still do \u201csubstantial and painful\u201d damage, as chief executive Matthias M\u00fceller put it. But what are the US authorities supposed to do? Forget about the scandal and not apply the country\u2019s environmental laws? Sorry, but that route is paved with moral hazard. There is no point in ruining VW \u2013 but, equally, fines are meant to hurt when the offences are serious.",

      "bodyText": "Bankers\u2019 bonuses should be withheld for up to a decade to give managers a longer-term view of their business, the new deputy chairman of Barclays has said. Sir Gerry Grimstone said he wanted to move \u201cto a system where a large part of variable remuneration are shares that you hold in the organisation for five years or 10 years\u201d. \u201cWhen you do that, management\u2019s time horizon extends,\u201d Grimstone added. Banks are already required to defer bonuses for seven years under new rules and Grimstone, who was quoted by Bloomberg, was speaking at conference that coincided with the publication of the first annual review of the industry issued by the Banking Standards Board. The BSB \u2013 set up in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal and intended to bolster the reputation of the industry \u2013 came into being last April. It has not published any industry-wide standards, but instead has spent its first nine months reviewing the internal culture of 10 founding members, and said it was not attempting to measure firms against a \u201cone-size-fits all culture template\u201d. The BSB\u2019s annual review \u2013 described as underwhelming by one critic \u2013 set out a number of ideas for banks to work on. \u201cIn many retail banks, aggressive sales targets appear to have been removed or softened,\u201d the review said. \u201cThis has produced a lack of certainty in some cases among staff and managers as to how performance is in practice now measured.\u201d It also said that \u201ca broader concept of diversity and a more transparent approach to measuring success, and one more clearly rooted in the firm\u2019s own purpose and business interests, would help many firms improve their effectiveness in fostering the culture that they are working hard in different ways to create\u201d. Alison Cottrell, the board\u2019s chief executive, said that one of the areas she would be working on this year would be developing voluntary standards for the industry. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) acknowledged that it took time to create new organisations but said not enough was being done to restore public confidence in the sector. \u201cOverall progress is a little underwhelming,\u201d said Iain Coke, head of ICAEW\u2019s financial services faculty. \u201cThe objective is to restore public trust. Useful as it may be to provide private feedback to banks on how they compare with their peers, this is unlikely to inspire public confidence. \u201cThe BSB should have two priority objectives: to start the process of setting standards; and to demonstrate it is willing to properly hold banks to account for meeting these.\u201d James Bardrick, head of the UK operations of US banking group Citi, countered the critics and said the process had been useful for his bank, which was one of the 10 assessed. Bardrick, who sits on the board of the BSB, said it had helped the management understand if their messages from the top were filtering through the organisation. The founder members of the BSB are Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered.

    "webTitle": "Paddy Power's \u00a3280,000 penalty equal to three hours' trading", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bookmaker Paddy Power took less than three hours last year to bring in enough money to cover its recent \u00a3280,000 donation to good causes after encouraging problem gambling and failure to prevent money laundering. The Irish firm\u2019s 2015 results, its last before a \u00a35bn merger with Betfair, reveal that it pulled in revenues of \u20ac1.09bn (\u00a3850m) in 2015. The figure, up 24% on the previous year, equates to \u00a397,000 every hour. That means that less than three hours\u2019 worth of takings were sufficient to cover the cost of the \u00a3280,000 \u201cvoluntary payment\u201d it made at the behest of the Gambling Commission. Gambling campaigners said Paddy Power\u2019s surging revenues showed that the regulator was not doing enough to keep the industry\u2019s biggest companies in line. Matt Zarb-Cousin, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said: \u201cIf the Gambling Commission were serious, they\u2019d sanction operators properly instead of just asking them nicely to improve their behaviour.\u201d Paddy Power paid the sum after the Gambling Commission ruled it had encouraged a problem gambler to keep betting until he lost five jobs, his home and access to his children. The man in question was a frequent user of fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which have been described as the \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d of gambling, allowing players to stake \u00a3100 every 20 seconds. FOBTs are part of Paddy Power\u2019s \u201cmachine gaming\u201d division, whose revenues soared by 17% to \u00a394m last year. The \u00a3280,000 payment was also based on the firm\u2019s failure to perform sufficient checks to ensure customers were not using its machines to launder the proceeds of crime. The Gambling Commission can take action against companies that breach the Gambling Act 2005. The legislation states that companies should ensure that gambling is not associated with crime and protecting vulnerable people from being harmed. The commission\u2019s powers include imposing a financial penalty on a company and revoking its licence to operate if it breaches the act. Its verdict on Paddy Power, however, resulted only in the \u201cvoluntary\u201d \u00a3280,000 payment to a socially responsible cause and a promise to commission a review and \u201cshare learning\u201d from the case with other firms. Paddy Power also paid \u00a327,250 to cover the commission\u2019s investigation costs.

Analysis of Land Registry data from retirement lending advisory firm Bower Private Clients (BPC) is further evidence of the widening gap between the housing haves and have-nots. It says that more than 7,200 properties in this price bracket are being bought a year without a mortgage. Cash buyers have spent more than \u00a363bn in total on \u00a31m-plus homes in England and Wales since 2011, spending on average \u00a31.75m for a property. Andrea Rozario, chief corporate officer of BPC, said: \u201cProperty millionaire cash buyers are a growing force in the housing market highlighting the wealth which is concentrated in homes.\u201d Rozario, who previously ran the Equity Release Council, added: \u201cWe wanted to highlight how many wealthy homeowners there are in London and the south-east, but for a lot of people their wealth is tied up in bricks and mortar.\u201d The analysis comes after a report from a high street lender predicted that the number of properties in Britain worth \u00a31m or more would more than triple by 2030. Less than 500,000 homes in the UK are currently valued at \u00a31m plus, but Santander said this would increase to more than 1.6m in the next 15 years. The research from BPC shows that almost two-thirds of cash buyers bought in London where the average spend per property hit \u00a31.89m, but southern and eastern England also saw high numbers of cash buyers for \u00a31m-plus homes. In London, 22,852 properties costing \u00a31m-plus have been bought for cash since 2011, and 7,864 elsewhere in the south-east. This compares with 641 in the north-west, 496 in the West Midlands and 239 in Yorkshire and Humberside. At the bottom of the table were Wales and the north-east, with 52 and 79 respectively. The cash sales are just the tip of the iceberg. More than 110,000 homes worth \u00a31m or more have been bought in the past five years across England and Wales, with a total of \u00a3192.7bn spent. More than two-thirds were at least partially funded by mortgages. The analysis shows that in London, \u00a31m-plus properties bought for cash included 3,908 detached houses, 7,574 flats, 3,253 semi-detached and 8,116 terrace houses over the last five years. Essex-based BPC, which focuses on London and the south-east, hopes to tap into the need for more specialist advice by recruiting 10 advisers from private banks such as Coutts, and offers specialist underwriting for rich clients. The company says it is the first to launch a high net worth equity release advice business. It competes with firms such as Key Retirement and Age Partnership.",

    "webTitle": "Biggest fall in Chinese exports in seven years hits mining shares", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in mining companies fell heavily in the City on Tuesday after the biggest fall in China\u2019s exports in almost seven years rekindled concerns about the impact of a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy on the rest of the world. Official figures released in Beijing showed that exports in February were down 25.4% on a year earlier, the worst performance since May 2009, the trough of the global recession. News that imports were down by 13.8% \u2013 the 16th successive decline \u2013 resulted in a reversal of the recent rally in the price of oil and industrial metals. David Lipton, deputy managing director of the IMF, warned that global trade flows were being dragged down by weak export and import growth in three of the leading emerging market countries \u2013 China, Russia and Brazil \u2013 which he said were coming \u201cunder considerable stress\u201d. Analysts said the timing of the Chinese new year exaggerated the weakness of exports, but that sales of goods overseas \u2013 the mainstay of the economy during its rapid growth of the past three decades \u2013 had still been poor. China posted a trade surplus of $32.59bn (\u00a323bn) for the month, down from $63.29bn in January, the General Administration of Customs said. The worse-than-expected Chinese trade data sent leading shares sharply lower, with UK, German and French markets all down around 1% by the close of trading on Tuesday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7% by midday. The FTSE 100 finished down 56.96 points, or 0.92%, at 6125.44, with commodity companies the main fallers. A fall in the oil price also hit sentiment, as Brent crude fell back below $40 a barrel. It dropped 2.5% to $39.82 following suggestions from Goldman Sachs that the recent rally was overdone and comments from Kuwait suggesting it would not participate in a production freeze unless other major producers, including Iran, followed suit. Commodity companies made up seven of the top 10 fallers in the FTSE 100 as investors cashed in on recent gains in the sector. Glencore dropped 18% to 139.75p, also hit by news of a mining accident, with at least two fatalities, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Anglo American lost 15% to 530.9p while Antofagasta and Rio Tinto both fell more than 9%. BP ended 3% lower at 354.2p. Speaking in Washington, Lipton said immediate action was needed to boost a flagging global recovery. \u201cWhat may be most disconcerting is that the rise in global risk aversion is leading to a sharp retrenchment in global capital and trade flows. Last year, for example, emerging markets saw about $200bn in net capital outflows, compared with $125bn in net capital inflows in 2014. \u201cTrade flows meanwhile are being dragged down by weak export and import growth in large emerging markets such as China, as well as Russia and Brazil, which have been under considerable stress.\u201d China\u2019s growth slowed last year to 6.9%, its slowest in a quarter of a century, and a further easing is expected in 2016 as the country seeks to end its reliance on exports and rebalance its economy towards consumer spending. After decades in which China has been a magnet for foreign capital and for the commodities needed to power its industrial development, Lipton said financial markets were still trying to work out what the transition to a new economic model meant for trade and investment flows. China\u2019s February trade performance was far worse than economists had expected, with analysts polled by Reuters predicting that exports would decline by 12.5% and imports by 10%. \u201cThe sharp drop in imports also shatters the hope that China is rolling out a stimulus package that would boost the demand for commodities,\u201d said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank in Singapore. \u201cThe recent rally in bulk commodities, led by iron ore, might be only short-lived.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A combination of weak Chinese export figures hitting commodity companies and a falling oil price has sent European stock markets lower for the second day running. The disappointing trade figures from China renewed fears of a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy, although this was tempered by the thought that the country\u2019s central bank could be prompted to step in again with further stimulus measures. Investors were also unsettled by a fall in oil prices following comments from Goldman Sachs that the recent rally was unjustified, and suggestions from Kuwait that it would not join in an output freeze unless other major producers, notably Iran, agreed. Iran has only just returned to export markets after sanctions were lifted and would rather ramp up production again rather than agree cuts. So Brent crude, after earlier climbing as high as $41.48 a barrel, is now down nearly 3% at $39.77. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 56.96 points or 0.92% at 6125.44 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 9692.82 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.86% at 4404.02 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 0.23% to 18,017.56 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.53% lower at 8740.3 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.76% to 563.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 46 points or 0.28%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Come to that, the US Federal Reserve does not have an easy decision to make at this month\u2019s meeting. Many believe its decision to raise rates in December was a mistake, and the chances of it hiking again in March seemed to be getting slimmer. But it could yet act: Meanwhile the European Central Bank has its own dilemma on Thursday, in terms of what further stimulus measures it unveils. In December it ended up falling short of expectations: The Bank of England is still more likely to raise rates than cut them over the next two years, according to monetary policy committee member Martin Weale, despite the recent financial turmoil. In a speech at the University of Nottingham Weale, who backed a rate rise in 2014, said the Bank had other tools to boost the economy if necessary. More quantitative easing could be used, with the Bank possibly buying private sector assets as well as government bonds. But he said a rate cut below 0.5% could also be made if needed. More big bonuses for bankers. Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 the bailed-out bank which is 73% owned by the UK taxpayer and recently reported its eighth consecutive year of annual losses \u2013 has handed its top management team bonuses in shares worth \u00a317.4m, writes Jill Treanor. The full story is here: Markets continue to head lower as the oil price falls and mining stocks suffer in the wake of the Chinese trade data. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: China\u2019s trade data provided the perfect excuse for some nifty profit-taking (and hearty back-slapping) for anyone with the bravery to buy into mining shares back in January. Since then the sector has sky-rocketed, but with Goldmans calling the end of the rally in raw materials, these hardy souls can hardly be blamed for taking some of their gains off the table. Had such dire trade figures arrived during the turmoil of last August, or indeed during the slumps of January and February, we may have seen a bigger reaction. As it was, the market seems content to write the data off as in the past, with recent currency depreciation and signs of stimulus likely to make next month\u2019s numbers look much better. Sterling is also heading lower: Oil has been slipping back from its highs and adding to the negative sentiment, although Brent crude is still above the $40 a barrel mark. A note earlier from Goldman Sachs suggested the recent rally in crude may be overdone, with the market still oversupplied and prices needing to fall further for stocks to shrink substantially. Meanwhile hopes of a cut in output were dampened by comments from Kuwait. The country\u2019s acting oil minister Anas al-Saleh said it would only commit to a production freeze if major suppliers including Iran agreed to join the agreement. Iran of course has only recently been allowed back on the export market after sanctions were lifted and is understandably keen to keep production going. If some producers failed to join the freeze, Reuters reported him saying: I\u2019ll go full power if there\u2019s no agreement. Every barrel I produce, I\u2019ll sell. Brent is currently down 1.7% at $40.16 a barrel having earlier reached $41.48. With global markets under pressure after the disappointing Chinese export figures, it is no surprise Wall Street is following suit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 84 points or 0.48% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.47% lower and Nasdaq fell 0.7%. ECB president Mario Draghi has a number of options for further stimulus measures at this week\u2019s central bank meeting and is under pressure not to disappoint the markets again (as happened in December), says Richard Falkenhall, senior foreign exchange strategist at Nordic bank SEB: Mario Draghi and the ECB are expected to deliver more stimulus on Thursday. However, Draghi may not want to push too much, preferring instead to avoid risking a split vote in the Governing Council. Given the large menu of options, the outcome is very difficult to predict in detail. New staff projections will revise the ECB\u2019s macro outlook, especially for inflation, to be significantly lower. Falling inflation expectations and continued downward revisions to inflation projections increase risks of second-round effects. This will put the ECB under considerable pressure to deliver more, not only to boost growth and inflation, but also to avoid disappointing already high market expectations, which would results in tighter financial conditions. Our main scenario is a 10 basis point deposit rate cut, the introduction of a two-tiered deposit rate system and the announcement of an additional \u20ac15bn in monthly asset purchases. The two-tiered system will alleviate cost pressures on banks and keep hopes of further rate cuts alive. For now, we expect this will largely satisfy markets, resulting in only limited market reactions in such a scenario. Over to Greece, and representatives of the country\u2019s creditors may be heading back to Athens to restart work on reviewing the progress of its bailout, but they may struggle to get around the place later this week: David Lipton ended his speech with a Churchillian call for better monetary, fiscal, and structural policies to tackle the economic crisis. Now is the time to decisively support economic activity and put the global economy on a sounder footing. This requires some tough choices, with advanced economies in particular needing to step up to the plate through the three-pronged approach I have described, as well as measures to make the global financial system more efficient and resilient. Winston Churchill said, \u201cI never worry about action, but only inaction.\u201d This is one of those moments where action\u2014concerted action\u2014 is needed. This, Lipton argued, would help to heal the banking sector, provide support to emerging economies, and help countries to lower their debt-to-GDP ratios over time. Here\u2019s the full speech: Policy Imperatives for Boosting Global Growth and Prosperity The deputy chief of the International Monetary Fund is urging governments to take \u201cbold\u201d action to steer the world economy away from potential crisis. David Lipton, First Deputy managing director of the Fund, is telling an audience in Washington DC that risks to the global recovery have risen. He says: Global economic recovery continues, but we are clearly at a delicate juncture, where risk of economic derailment has grown. Lipton cites the volatile financial markets and low commodity prices as key factors, along with the concerns that governments and central bankers have run out of ideas, or enthusiasm. These concerns are partly being fed by a perception that policymakers in many economies have run out of ammunition or lost the resolve to deploy it. For the sake of the global economy, it is imperative that advanced and developing countries dispel this dangerous notion by reviving the bold spirit of action and cooperation that characterized the early years of the recovery effort. And crucially, he says governments should use their tax and spending muscle to prevent another global downturn. Fiscal polices should be made \u201cmore growth-friendly\u201d where possible, argues Lipton. And countries with \u201cfiscal space\u201d should use that flexibility to boost infrastructure spending, or by cutting taxes. That might push up government debt levels, but Lipton argues that it\u2019s well worth considering. We know that infrastructure investment can be particularly beneficial, not only because it is deeply needed in some advanced economies, but as it has positive spillover effects to the rest of the economy. Raising wages and tax cuts to promote spending can also be effective, particularly in countries that have current account surpluses. These need to be carefully designed and directed to those that are most likely to spend the proceeds. The Bank of England is now \u201cembroiled\u201d in the Brexit debate following today\u2019s punchy session at parliament, says our economics editor Larry Elliott. He writes: Mark Carney described as \u201centirely unfounded\u201d the suggestion from the pro-Brexit Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg that the Bank was being politically partisan and jeopardising its reputation for \u201cOlympian detachment\u201d by emphasising the pros but not the cons of EU membership. Giving evidence to MPs on the Treasury select committee, the governor provided backing for David Cameron by warning that there would be short-term costs to the UK from a decision to leave the EU in June \u2013 including weaker investment, lower consumer spending and the relocation of foreign-owned banks to Ireland or continental Europe. Carney said the deal negotiated by Cameron last month had addressed the issues identified by the Bank as necessary to ensure the UK\u2019s monetary and financial stability. However, Carney had to fend off an attack from Rees-Mogg, who said it was \u201cbeneath the dignity\u201d of the governor to be making \u201cspeculative\u201d comments about the beneficial impact of EU membership. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full report Oil prices are continuing their recent recovery, despite today\u2019s Chinese export data. Brent crude has hit a new three-month high, up 1.1% at $41.31 per barrel, having broken though the $40 mark yesterday. Quite a recovery, from the $27.10 touched in mid-January. Some analysts predict that oil will weaken again, though, given the oversupply issues dogging the market: The 25% tumble in Chinese exports in February continues to loom over the markets. The timing of the Lunar New Year may be a factor, but the underlying theme is that China\u2019s new growth targets could soon be in trouble. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, reckons Beijing may need to do more to encourage consumer spending, and aid the transition away from manufacturing. This export slump again underlines the huge challenges that China\u2019s export-driven model is facing and how domestic demand needs to grow to take up the slack in order to maintain the growth momentum. If this does not happen, China\u2019s growth is likely to slow considerably and be below the 6.5% target set by the government this week.\u201d Mark Carney\u2019s grilling has ended, after the governor warned that Brexit was the biggest single \u201cdomestic risk\u201d to Britain\u2019s economy. If you missed it, Andy Sparrow\u2019s liveblog has all the details: European finance ministers looked in good spirits this morning, as they gathered for today\u2019s ECOFIN meeting. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the eurogroup of euzone finance ministers, even indulged in a little light horseplay with Greece\u2019s Euclid Tsakalotos. We trust this isn\u2019t the EU\u2019s new negotiating strategy with Athens.... Ouch. America\u2019s small firms have suffered a drop in confidence last month, according to new data from the US. Fears over sales growth have hit spending plans, and deterred firms from taking on new staff, according to the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Its optimism index has dipped to 92.9, from 94.2 in January, with every measure of confidence deteriorating. It\u2019s not a massive slump. However, it does suggest that economic conditions in the world\u2019s largest economy may have deteriorated in February. Talk of global downturns, and the sight of shares sliding on Wall Street, won\u2019t have helped. Some theories are just too good to not be true. And here\u2019s a prime example. Some experts reckon the iron ore price surged 19% yesterday because China\u2019s horticulture industry wants steel mills to shut down. For five months. That would stop them pumping pollution into the sky, and mean their upcoming garden show would enjoy nice sunny skies, not clouds of smog. By parliamentary standards, the Treasury Committee\u2019s session on the EU referendum is a real punch-up. Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, kicked the session off by insisting that that the BoE wasn\u2019t making a recommendation on Brexit. But he swiftly got a kicking of his own, from Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, who accused Carney of \u201cspeculative pro-EU comments\u201d. In between flashing death stares at Rees-Mogg, Carney insisted he wouldn\u2019t allow that claim to stand, as aides wondered whether they should have brought sponges and a towel. In between the sparring, Carney argued that Britain\u2019s renegotiated settlement would help the UK\u2019s financial stability. Here\u2019s the details: It\u2019s still being streamed live, here. These charts from Bloomberg show the scale of the Chinese export slump last month: The decline was worryingly broad-based, suggesting a significant tailing off in global demand: Traders are nervous today ahead of Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, where fresh stimulus measures could be announced. Fears that Mario Draghi might disappoint the markets (as he did in December) have pushed the euro back above $1.1. Joshua Mahony of IG says this anxiety is being compounded by the poor trade data from China: European stock markets have started the day on a very shaky footing, with the DAX in particular falling sharply following a surprisingly bad batch of trade data overnight. Despite the incredible rally in iron ore yesterday, the 25% fall in exports and 14% drop in imports for February prove it pays to be apprehensive about the Chinese growth story for now. With China representing the second largest export market for the eurozone, this continued slowdown will no doubt worry ECB members ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting. It is clear markets have learnt their lessons from the December ECB meeting, with euro shorts and DAX longs being closed out ahead of the release. Despite the high likeliness of action from the ECB, there is no guarantee of the direction markets will move and thus traders are unlikely to be as bold this time, after being burnt three months ago. Deposit rate cuts seem the likeliest, yet this is unlikely to appease QE thirsty markets which have proven to be relatively single minded in their view of what represents a satisfactory policy boost. After two hours of trading, European markets are steadily in the red following today\u2019s rough Chinese trade data. The FTSE 100 is still down around 1%, and there are chunkier losses across the continent where the French CAC and German DAX have both lost around 1.5%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says investors are worried by the 25% year-on-year tumble in Chinese exports last month. \u201cEquity markets are in the red again this morning, with disappointing overnight Chinese trade data showing plunging February exports (-25%) serving to spook investors who are already concerned about the state of global growth. The market reaction is in stark contrast to the habitual cheering about bad data implying more stimulus, and the Lunar New Year may explain the big drop.\u201d Bank of England governor Mark Carney has just begun giving evidence to the Treasury committee on the UK\u2019s EU referendum. You can watch it live here. Our Politics Liveblog is tracking all the action: Oxford Economics have just issued a new report on the EU referendum. It has found that a vote for Brexit will knock over 1% off the size of the UK economy, and also hit share prices. Here\u2019s the details: A scenario run on the Oxford Global Model suggests that Brexit would leave the level of UK GDP 1.3 percentage points lower by Q2 2018 compared with our baseline forecast that the UK votes to stay in the EU. A vote to leave would mainly shock business confidence but consumers would be adversely affected too. Exporters in price-sensitive sectors would benefit from a weaker exchange rate. Market pricing suggests that sterling could initially fall by around 15% before recovering some of its losses, while the heightened uncertainty would also be expected to drive a sharp drop in equity prices in H2 2016. Brexit would present something of a dilemma for policymakers. While a weaker pound would cause inflation to initially spike upwards, we would expect the MPC to look through this and cutBank Rate in order to support activity. And with the UK likely to retain its reputation as a safe haven, this would also see gilt yields stay lower for longer. Weaker growth would also put the Chancellor in breach of the fiscal mandate, though we would expect him to plead extenuating circumstances, rather than tighten policy and potentially exacerbate the slowdown. They also reckon, though, that Britain will vote to stay in the EU. The International Monetary Fund is preparing a report on the impact of Britain voting to leave the European Union. IMF chief Christine Lagarde announced the plan this morning, and also appeared to reveal that it will warn against Brexit. Unions are seeking urgent talks with Npower after the energy company confirmed plans to cut 2,400 jobs. This morning\u2019s announcement comes two days after the news leaked to the press \u2013 and UNISON General Secretary Dave Prentis says staff deserve better. \u201cNpower bosses are compounding the anxiety for staff by refusing to meet the unions nationally to discuss this so-called recovery plan, to talk about how to protect jobs and avoid compulsory redundancies. We\u2019re calling for an emergency meeting so we can work jointly on finding a way out of the mess the company currently finds itself in. \u201cThe workforce will be hoping that the worst is now behind Npower, and that in future employees are the first to know if jobs are under threat.\u201c The slowdown in London\u2019s prime property market has hit profits at estate agent chain Foxtons. The group, known for its garish Minis and pushy sales techniques, has posted a 2.6% drop in pre-tax profits in 2015. It says property sales transactions levels in London \u201cremained subdued\u201d in 2015, partly because May\u2019s General Election deterred some buyers. It also warned that the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU membership could hit demand this year, as.... ...it is too early to predict how transaction volumes may be impacted by recent changes to the tax regime and the short term political and economic uncertainty caused by the UK referendum on leaving the European Union. Yesterday an investment firm warned that London\u2019s top-end property market was cooling, partly because so many luxury flats are coming onto the market. German factories have surprised analysts, in a good way, by posted a 3.3% jump in production in January. That\u2019s much stronger than expected, and the biggest increase since September 2009. Ralph Solveen, head of economic research at Commerzbank, called it \u201ca good start\u201d for Germany, but cautioned: \u201cWe don\u2019t think that this will start a lasting uptrend.\u201d Yesterday, German factories reported a 0.1% drop in new orders in January, which could suggest production will be weaker this spring. Fashion chain Burberry is defying today\u2019s selloff, though. Its shares jumped by 5%, after it emerged last night that a \u2018mystery investor\u2019 has been quietly snaffling up shares. A takeover battle could be looming, perhaps from a rival luxury brand or even a private equity operation. London\u2019s stock markets is falling in early trading, as traders get another dose of Chinese angst. The FTSE 100 fell 60 points, or 1%, at the open to hit 6123 points. Mining stocks, who are dependent on emerging markets for growth, are leading the selloff: Conner Campbell says the 25% plunge in Chinese exports has spooked the City. That shocking slide in exports was joined by at similarly weak, if not quite as alarming, 13.8% drop in imports; combine the two together and it is the kind of ugly reminder of China\u2019s spluttering economy investors certainly don\u2019t need at the moment. Here\u2019s some gloomy reaction to the 25% slump in Chinese exports last month, from Reuters. XIAO SHIJUN, ANALYST AT GUODOU SECURITIES, BEIJING February\u2019s trade data is really poor and that will exert depreciation pressure on the yuan. However, the recent lacklustre performance of the U.S. dollar in global markets, together with the Chinese central bank\u2019s determination to keep the yuan relatively stable for now, means that the yuan will not weaken sharply in the near term. More uncertainties lie in the medium term.\u201d NIE WEN, ANALYST AT HWABAO TRUST IN SHANGHAI \u201cChina will face a more challenging situation in trade this year than 2015. Both imports and exports in February fell more than our expectations. Exports were largely dragged by a weak global demand from both developed and emerging countries.\u201d And here\u2019s a more positive take: JULIAN EVANS-PRITCHARD, CHINA ECONOMIST AT CAPITAL ECONOMICS IN SNGAPORE \u201cExports were very strong last year in February - up nearly 50 percent - because the Lunar New Year started so late and much of the usual disruption from the holiday was pushed into March. \u201cSo there\u2019s a big seasonal effect and the implication is that we\u2019ll probably see a significant reversal and a stronger number next month, \u201cExports were very strong last year in February - up nearly 50 percent - because the Lunar New Year started so late and much of the usual disruption from the holiday was pushed into March. \u201cSo there\u2019s a big seasonal effect and the implication is that we\u2019ll probably see a significant reversal and a stronger number next month.\u201d China\u2019s alarmingly weak trade data has hit most Asian markets. Japan\u2019s Nikkei shed 1%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng lost 0.7%, and the South Korean Kospi fell 0.75%. China\u2019s own stock markets slumped by 3%, but then curiously rebounded in late trading to close up 0.1%. Traders may be betting that China will take more steps to stimulate its economy, having set a growth rate target of 6.5% or better this year. Fears over China\u2019s slowing economy are swirling again this morning after it reported that exports shrank by a quarter (!) last month. It\u2019s the biggest slump in seven years, since the depths of the financial crisis, and can only add to concerns that the Chinese economy is suffering a nauseously bumpy hard landing. New government figures showed that exports sank 25.4% year-on-year to $126.1bn last month. Economists has expected a decline of around 14.5%. Imports were also down, but less alarmingly. They fell 13.8% year-on-year, a recovery from January\u2019s 18.8% tumble. The export slump can partly be blamed on the Chinese New Year, which fell earlier in February this year. But the problems surely run deeper than that. China\u2019s customs office reports that \u201cimports from and exports to major trade partners declined\u201d in February. It cited falling sales of labour-intensive goods, including mechanical and electrical products and apparel. And the slump sent shivers through the markets. Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong, called it \u201canother shocker.\u201d \u201cMore stimulus is likely to be needed on both the monetary and fiscal front, and that will argue against the yuan stability China craves.\u201d Evan Lucas of IG is also concerned, calling the numbers \u201cterrible\u201d. Its February trade surplus of $32.59bn was 36% below estimates as exports collapsed down to 25.4% year-on-year. Chinese Lunar New Year always skews the February numbers; however, the figure is much lower than expected and such a big miss has created some angst. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s an edgy time in the markets. Yesterday, we saw the iron ore price surge 20%, and oil rally over $40, a sign of new optimism over growth prospects. But that was countered by a drop in German factory orders, and a fall in investor confidence, indicating the market turbulence which struck in January has caused real damage. Today we\u2019ll be tracking the latest Chinese trade data and a new heathcheck from Germany\u2019s factory sector, for further clues. We\u2019ll also be monitoring Greece, after inspectors from its creditors agreed to return to Athens to review its bailout. That long-awaited talk about debt relief could finally be close, once Greece has satisfied its lenders. Also coming up this morning: European finance ministers are gathering in Brussels this morning for an ECOFIN meeting. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, will be testifying to MPs about the EU referendum from 9.15am \u2013 our Politics Team should be covering that. On the corporate front, we\u2019re getting results from Germany\u2019s second-largest utility, RWE, which is cutting thousands of jobs at its UK division, nPower. Bookmaker Paddy Power and estate agent Foxtons will also be updating the markets.",

However, Draghi may not want to push too much, preferring instead to avoid risking a split vote in the Governing Council. Given the large menu of options, the outcome is very difficult to predict in detail. New staff projections will revise the ECB\u2019s macro outlook, especially for inflation, to be significantly lower. Falling inflation expectations and continued downward revisions to inflation projections increase risks of second-round effects. This will put the ECB under considerable pressure to deliver more, not only to boost growth and inflation, but also to avoid disappointing already high market expectations, which would results in tighter financial conditions.</p> <p>Our main scenario is a 10 basis point deposit rate cut, the introduction of a two-tiered deposit rate system and the announcement of an additional \u20ac15bn in monthly asset purchases. The two-tiered system will alleviate cost pressures on banks and keep hopes of further rate cuts alive.

Despite the incredible rally in iron ore yesterday, the 25% fall in exports and 14% drop in imports for February prove it pays to be apprehensive about the Chinese growth story for now. With China representing the second largest export market for the eurozone, this continued slowdown will no doubt worry ECB members ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting.</p> <p>It is clear markets have learnt their lessons from the December ECB meeting, with euro shorts and DAX longs being closed out ahead of the release. Despite the high likeliness of action from the ECB, there is no guarantee of the direction markets will move and thus traders are unlikely to be as bold this time, after being burnt three months ago.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 the bailed-out bank which recently reported its eighth consecutive year of annual losses \u2013 has handed its top management team future bonuses in shares worth \u00a317.4m. The bank, 73% owned by the taxpayer, also released bonuses already earned worth more than \u00a35m to the top management team, including the chief executive, Ross McEwan, who took the helm in October 2013. The \u00a317.4m of share awards were announced to the stock market less than a fortnight after RBS reported a \u00a32bn loss for 2015 \u2013 taking the total losses to more than \u00a350bn since its 2008 bailout when taxpayers pumped \u00a345bn into the bank. McEwan, who was promoted from running the retail arm of RBS to replace Stephen Hester, has attempted to defuse rows over pay by ending the practice of handing annual bonuses to his top management team. Even so, members of the team are still receiving bonuses handed out in previous years and being awarded shares through three-year performance plans. The \u00a317.4m of shares awarded to McEwan and his 10-strong management team are based on performance over three years and will not be released until 2020 and 2021, when the executives will find out if they are paid in full. McEwan, who was paid \u00a33.8m in 2015, was handed shares worth \u00a32.6m as part of this long-term share plan. The London Stock Exchange announcement shows that two executives \u2013 Mark Bailie and Chris Marks \u2013 each received almost \u00a31m of shares through annual bonuses handed to them in previous years when they worked in the investment banking arm of RBS. They were both awarded \u00a32m of shares under the long-term bonus plan. Shares in RBS are trading at 229p, well below the 502p at which taxpayers break even on their stake and below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the first tranche in August at a \u00a31bn loss. Campaigners for a tax on financial services at the Robin Hood Tax campaign compared the RBS bonuses with the 1% pay rise for NHS workers. \u201cOnce again different rules seem to apply to the banking sector who, eight years on, have yet to pay the price for their part in the financial crisis. The government must step up and stop this special treatment for the City,\u201d David Hillman, spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign said. RBS notified the stock market of the share awards on Tuesday just 10 minutes after rival bailed-out bank Lloyds Banking Group confirmed the scale of payouts to its management team. Lloyds, in which taxpayers continue to have a stake of just under 10%, revealed last month that its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, and his 10 top managers were receiving awards of shares worth \u00a320m. The chancellor wants to sell off much of the remaining stake in Lloyds to the public but was forced to postpone the sale because of the slump in shares during January\u2019s stock-market rout. However, the shares have recovered some of their losses but are trading at about 71p \u2013 still below the 73.6p at which taxpayers break even. In Lloyds\u2019 annual report it said there could be market volatility before and after the EU referendum on 23 June.",

    "webTitle": "Walthamstow to rival Pimlico as property hotspot, Foxtons says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Foxtons, the London-based estate agency, has said it expects Walthamstow to become as important for its business as Pimlico, as it reported a slowdown in property transactions last year in the centre of the capital. The chief executive, Nic Budden, said despite lower property prices in the suburb at the north-east end of the Victoria line, an increase in house sales meant there was \u00a31.6m more potential revenue than in its more salubrious rival at the other end of the London Underground line. Budden said: \u201cThis means that, with a similar market share, the Walthamstow market will be as valuable to us as Pimlico is today in time.\u201d Last year, 514 properties were sold in Pimlico and Westminster with an average price of \u00a31.2m, making the market worth \u00a3618m, or a potential \u00a315.4m in fees at 2.5%, Buddden said. In Walthamstow, where Foxtons opened a branch in 2015, 1,722 properties changed hands for an average of \u00a3395,000, amounting to \u00a3680m in sales and \u00a317m in potential fees. Walthamstow, whose name partly inspired the fictitious Walford in EastEnders, is one of London\u2019s gentrifying hotspots. Long seen as up and coming due to its fast links to the City and the West End and the leafy \u201cvillage\u201d at its heart, the area has attracted families priced out of Hackney and Islington. Last year the number of property millionaires in Waltham Forest, the London borough encompassing Walthamstow and Chingford, grew 56% as the number of homes worth \u00a31m or more hit 1,330. Foxtons\u2019 website shows a \u00a31.35m double-fronted, four-bedroom house that is under offer and located in Walthamstow village. Budden said he used the example of Walthamstow to illustrate the growth occurring around London\u2019s periphery as buyers look for areas with attractive, affordable property. He added: \u201cOuter London we see as far more natural markets. People buying and selling houses for \u00a3200,000 or \u00a3300,000 in Walthamstow are far less impacted by the global economic scene.\u201d Foxtons, known for aggressive sales techniques and its fleet of liveried Mini cars, has expanded outwards from its central London base to tap into rising prices and higher transaction volumes as London homebuyers are pushed out to the suburbs and commuter belt. Budden said outer zones were less affected by political and economic uncertainty than central London, where the market is driven by wealthy buyers and investors, often from overseas. Foxtons\u2019 average sale price last year was \u00a3550,000, which is up 1%. A third of its sales were for less than \u00a3400,000. Since listing its shares on the stock market in 2013, Foxtons has opened 21 branches, mainly in suburbs such as Ruislip, Croydon and Tooting. It will have 63 branches by the end of this spring. Despite its association with desirable central London neighbourhoods, Foxtons was founded by Jon Hunt in Notting Hill in 1981 when it was far removed from the affluence evident in Richard Curtis\u2019s eponymous 1999 film. Foxtons\u2019 pre-tax profit for the year ended 31 December fell 2.6% to \u00a341m as central London profits declined and the company spent money opening branches in outer London. Foxtons said the number of house sales it carried out in central London declined because of high prices and increases in stamp duty. Budden said: \u201cIn central London, transactions fell particularly sharply as a result of stamp duty changes \u2026 and high levels of price [inflation]. The central market is going to stay at pretty subdued levels going forward until there is some conclusion on Brexit and further economic stability.\u201d Fears are increasing that London\u2019s high-end property market is heading for a crash caused by rapid price rises and a glut of newly built expensive flats in the centre of the capital. This has combined with slackening demand from wealthy foreign investors, due to China\u2019s economic slowdown and tumbling oil and commodity prices. Capital &amp; Counties, the luxury flatbuilder, said last month that demand was falling because of excess supply and a new stamp duty surcharge on second homes. Foxtons said it was too early to say how much a vote to leave the EU would affect its business. City figures have warned that firms could move operations out of London, Europe\u2019s financial centre, if Britain left the EU. Listing potential risks to its business, Foxtons said: \u201cThe market may also be affected by any reduction in London\u2019s standing as a major financial city caused by a decision by the UK to leave the EU.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Wall Street bonuses fell 9% to an average of $146,200 in 2015, driven down by a \u201cchallenging year in the financial markets\u201d and new regulations, according to New York state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. The decline in the banking bonuses was the result, in large part, of a 10.5% decline in profits on Wall Street to $14.3bn in 2015, according to the report from the watchdog. The figures reflect a steady decline in bonuses since the financial crisis in 2008 and the implementation of new controls on how bonuses are awarded. \u201cThis was the third consecutive year of lower profits,\u2019\u2019 DiNapoli said of the financial industry, a major driver of New York\u2019s economy. According to the DiNapoli, Wall Street\u2019s total bonus pool for 2015 came to $25bn, down 6% from 2014 and 27% lower than the peak in 2006, when the average bonus hit $191,360. The falls reflect the added number of employees banks have taken on related to compliance requirements and signal the costs of higher capital requirements and boosting returns to shareholders. The entire financial sector is reporting tougher trading environments as the slowdown in China and drop in commodity prices take their toll. \u201cBecause of the markets being down, we have to assume that some of those options being exercised now are of less value than they were a year or two ago,\u201d DiNapoli said. Last year, five of the six major Wall Street banks saw their stock prices sink \u2013 with Morgan Stanley falling the furthest, down 18%. Many banks are implementing deeper than usual culls on underperforming workers, and moving backroom jobs from metropolitan areas such as New York and New Jersey to regional cities such as Salt Lake City and Dallas, or offshore altogether. The fall is bad news for New York. Some 17.5% of state revenue, or $12.5bn, comes from the financial industry, mostly through income taxes. The real estate and luxury goods markets, which typically enjoy an uptick in business at bonus time, will also be nervously watching to see how the fall will impact their businesses. DiNapoli said he did not hold out much hope of improvement this year, given \u201congoing weaknesses in the global economy and market volatility\u201d.",

The lobby group Oil &amp; Gas UK said about 14bn barrels of an estimated 20bn barrels of oil lying beneath the UK continental shelf in the North Sea would not be extracted unless conditions for the industry improved. Economics director Mike Tholen said this could result in a decline in production that \u201cputs at risk hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs, billions of pounds of tax revenues and the UK\u2019s energy security\u201d. Among the measures North Sea explorers want to see is a large cut in the rate of tax on their production, which can be up to 67.5% on profit for older fields. Oil &amp; Gas UK said the standard tax rate on oil profits of 50% should be cut by 20 percentage points, while petroleum revenue tax of 35% applied to older fields should be scrapped altogether. \u201cThe incentivising effect on investment and production in the long term should render it of minimal cost to government,\u201d said Tholen. The regime governing fields being decommissioned should be changed so tax breaks could be passed on if the field was sold, he added. Oil &amp; Gas UK also wants George Osborne to address a decline in investment that is set to see money spent on new projects slump from an average of \u00a38bn annually over the past five years to less than \u00a31bn this year. Tholen said this could be achieved by removing special taxes from any discoveries made over the next five years. He also called for new allowances on existing fields and a government-backed loan guarantee scheme. \u201cTo bridge the gap between the 6.3bn barrels of oil and gas on the UK continental shelf in which investment is already approved and the 20bn that we estimate are out there, we must fight fiercely to attract global capital,\u201d he said. \u201cThat requires us to be attractive in cost, technology and fiscal terms, and this year\u2019s budget presents the perfect opportunity for the government to signal to investors its long-term ambition for the sector.\u201d Oil &amp; Gas UK pointed to efforts the North Sea industry had made to save money in a region where oil is relatively costly to extract.

      "bodyText": "Tesco has halved the pace of its sales decline in the past month as price cuts have helped stem the loss of customers elsewhere. The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket enjoyed its best performance since July, with sales down 0.8% in the 12 weeks to 28 February, compared with a 1.6% decline revealed a month earlier, according to analysts Kantar Worldpanel. Separate figures from analysis firm Nielsen suggested Tesco was doing even better, with sales falling by just 0.5%, the chain\u2019s best performance since November 2013. Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retail and business insight, said: \u201cTesco has been improving the basics, including its pricing. This has encouraged more visits and attracted back shoppers who had previously defected. \u201cTheir new customer proposition highlights the benefits of having a large variety of store types \u2013 physical and online. Supermarkets offering more locations, good private label and a superior customer experience \u2013 not just lower prices \u2013 tend to be more successful, and these are some of the areas where Tesco are focusing.\u201d The strong sales performance is good news for Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, who is under pressure to show results from his turnaround plan, which kicked off in autumn 2014. The improvement in sales came alongside a general pickup in the grocery market in February. Sales for the sector rose 0.5%, the fastest pace of growth since October, as chocolate sales rose 13% in February \u2013 thanks to Valentine\u2019s Day and early preparations for Easter. Sparkling wine sales also continued to soar \u2013 up 15% last month. Tesco\u2019s trade increase came at the expense of Asda and Morrisons, where the pace of sales declines increased. Asda\u2019s sales fell by 4% in the three months to the end of February, the chain\u2019s worst performance recorded by Kantar. The struggling retailer has lost 0.8 percentage points of market share over the past year. It controls 16.2% of UK grocery sales, putting it behind Sainsbury\u2019s, which is now the UK\u2019s second biggest supermarket with 16.8% market share. Tesco\u2019s market share is 28.4%. Asda boss Andy Clarke has said he is sticking to a plan of protecting profits and cutting prices, despite 15 months of falling sales culminating in the company\u2019s worst quarterly trading period. But he is under increasing pressure to turnaround performance before the arrival this autumn of his potential successor, Roger Burnley, a former Sainsbury\u2019s director. Sainsbury\u2019s was the only one of the big four chains to see growth over the three-month period. Its sales rose by 0.5%, its eighth consecutive period of growth. Morrisons\u2019 sales declined by 3.2%, compared with a 2.2% fall revealed by Kantar last month. The Bradford-based chain\u2019s sales continue to be impacted by store closures and price cuts. The changing face of the grocery market is clearly marked in the latest figures as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to grow rapidly. Lidl\u2019s sales rose 18.9%; Aldi\u2019s sales rose 15.1%, taking their combined market share to 10%. The Co-operative Group also continued its strong period of growth, with sales up 1.9%, as it benefits from the trend towards shopping little and often, as well as improvements to its stores, pricing and product range.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s rail system should be overhauled to allow rival train firms to run services on the same routes, eventually scrapping franchises for major intercity lines, according to the competition authorities. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), in a report published on Tuesday, said that more direct competition could lead to lower fares, greater efficiency and more effective use of capacity. The call comes ahead of the publication of Nicola Shaw\u2019s review into the future structure and financing of Network Rail, the government body responsible for the UK\u2019s rail infrastructure, a report commissioned by the Treasury that is expected alongside the budget next week. The CMA said the current system, in which rival firms compete for long-term franchises for particular routes, could be improved by increasing the number of \u201copen access\u201d services \u2013 the kind of additional passenger trains offered by Grand Central and First Hull Trains on the east coast line, for example \u2013 or by splitting franchises. But the CMA urged that in the long term rail should move towards a system of multiple licensed operators instead of franchises. While such an idea was considered and rejected on operational grounds when railways were privatised in 1994, the CMA\u2019s report says the potential for such competition exists on the three major intercity routes: the east and west coast mainlines, and the Great Western route, which serve 90 million passenger journeys annually. The chief executive of the CMA, Alex Chisholm, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve found that there is strong evidence, both here and abroad, of the benefits that the introduction of competition on mainline intercity routes can bring. Where competing operators have been given the opportunity, the need to attract passengers who have a choice can mean lower fares, new routes and destinations, more innovations and flexible ticketing. \u201cIn a more competitive environment companies will push to be more efficient and for there to be better use of existing capacity \u2013 so there are benefits for both the network and the taxpayer who helps subsidise the railways.\u201d Chisholm admitted there were legitimate concerns that open access could reduce the income paid to government from franchise operators but said the system could be reformed to make competing operators contribute more. That could mean higher track access charges and a levy to help fund unprofitable services in rural areas. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a real chance here to extend these benefits across a wider area and the timing is undoubtedly right to push for change. We hope all those involved with the future of the rail network will look at our report carefully and seize the opportunity.\u201d The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, gave a lukewarm response to the proposal. Paul Plummer, its chief executive, said the industry was actively engaged in the debate over how to harness competition and added: \u201cWe must take a joined-up and consistent approach to competition, freight, franchising, regulation, capacity, the shape of Network Rail and how we fund much-needed investment. Considering these in isolation is unlikely to deliver the best results for customers, freight users or taxpayers.\u201d Rail unions described the CMA report as \u201crisible\u201d. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said: \u201cThe idea that anything in this report would improve Britain\u2019s rail network is risible to anyone who works in, and understands, our industry. Breaking up the railway further will only increase costs. Competition in the rail industry is a myth. There is only one set of tracks.\u201d The Campaign for Better Transport said passengers would benefit far more from a joined-up network than greater competition. Stephen Joseph, the chief executive, said: \u201cThe government has committed billions to upgrading the railways to meet record passenger demand. Rather than handing this much-needed capacity to open access operators, as the CMA proposes, communities and the economy would benefit far more if train companies worked with new city regions and combined authorities on joined-up networks of public transport designed to support the local economy.\u201d But the consumer group Which? urged the government to listen to the CMA proposals. Its executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: \u201cOur annual rail survey shows that millions of passengers are not satisfied with the service they are receiving on Britain\u2019s railways. But on open access lines, where there is more competition between train companies, satisfaction is significantly higher. \u201cMore must be done to drive up standards for passengers \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t have to wait until the end of a lengthy franchise for services to be improved.\u201d The CMA is an independent, non-ministerial government department, and has sent its recommendations to the Department for Transport.",

      "bodyText": "Motor insurer Admiral has accelerated in a falling market on a positive outlook for the business and talk of a higher than expected payout to shareholders. Its shares are up 12p to \u00a319.56 as Nomura raised its recommendation from neutral to buy, partly on the prospect it could afford a capital return of some \u00a3300m to investors over the next two to three years. Nomura said: We believe Admiral offers an attractive combination of: 1) defensive qualities; 2) growth given rising UK motor rates; and 3) attractive returns via special dividends, which could surprise to the upside. The stock de-rated in the wake of reserve strengthening due to bodily injury claims in 2011 (which ultimately proved to be too conservative) and then additional regulatory headwinds and UK motor rate declines. Now we are seeing strong reserve releases, regulatory headwinds have subsided, and UK motor rates are rising again. We believe against this backdrop the stock should enjoy a good performance. Admiral has indicated it could return \u00a3150m to \u00a3200m to shareholders, but Nomura said its solvency rates would still be adequate if it handed back \u00a3300m. But esure has slipped despite a 30% rise in full year profits to \u00a3134m, boosted by the higher rates for motor insurance, but the insurer disappointed on its dividend. Analyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said: esure reported 2015 results which were broadly in line with our and the market\u2019s expectations at the trading profit and underlying earnings level but yet again disappointed and confused regarding its dividend policy. A pay-out of 70% resulted in a dividend of 11.5p compared to our expectations of an 80% pay-out and a 13.1p dividend\u2026consensus was at 12.9p. Although the group suggests that it has decided to retain capital to fund \u201cprofitable growth\u201d, the Solvency II coverage ratio of 123% (post dividend) implies that it didn\u2019t really have much room for manoeuvre. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is now down 44.16 points at 6138.24. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: It seems the longer investors have had to digest the morning\u2019s dramatic plunge in Chinese exports, the worse they are taking it, the European indices sporadically widening their losses as the day continued. Despite Brent Crude holdings its head above the $40.50 per barrel parapet (around halving its initial 1% decline) the FTSE struggled to gain any positive traction, lingering at a 40 point loss for most of the morning. That does, however, make it the best performing major indices, a few specks of green found in its commodity stocks (which are caught between oil\u2019s continued recovery and the ominous signs out of China) and a 6% surge from Burberry, following some surprising takeover speculation, keeping the FTSE from the lows seen by its European peers.",

Nomura said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We believe Admiral offers an attractive combination of: 1) defensive qualities; 2) growth given rising UK motor rates; and 3) attractive returns via special dividends, which could surprise to the upside.</p> <p>The stock de-rated in the wake of reserve strengthening due to bodily injury claims in 2011 (which ultimately proved to be too conservative) and then additional regulatory headwinds and UK motor rate declines. Now we are seeing strong reserve releases, regulatory headwinds have subsided, and UK motor rates are rising again. We believe against this backdrop the stock should enjoy a good performance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Admiral has indicated it could return \u00a3150m to \u00a3200m to shareholders, but Nomura said its solvency rates would still be adequate if it handed back \u00a3300m. <br></p> <p>But <strong>esure</strong> has slipped despite a 30% rise in full year profits to \u00a3134m, boosted by the higher rates for motor insurance, but the insurer disappointed on its dividend. Analyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>esure reported 2015 results which were broadly in line with our and the market\u2019s expectations at the trading profit and underlying earnings level but yet again disappointed and confused regarding its dividend policy.</p> <p> A pay-out of 70% resulted in a dividend of 11.5p compared to our expectations of an 80% pay-out and a 13.1p dividend\u2026consensus was at 12.9p. Although the group suggests that it has decided to retain capital to fund \u201cprofitable growth\u201d, the Solvency II coverage ratio of 123% (post dividend) implies that it didn\u2019t really have much room for manoeuvre. </p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is now down 44.16 points at 6138.24. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems the longer investors have had to digest the morning\u2019s dramatic plunge in Chinese exports, the worse they are taking it, the European indices sporadically widening their losses as the day continued.</p> <p>Despite Brent Crude holdings its head above the $40.50 per barrel parapet (around halving its initial 1% decline) the FTSE struggled to gain any positive traction, lingering at a 40 point loss for most of the morning. That does, however, make it the best performing major indices, a few specks of green found in its commodity stocks (which are caught between oil\u2019s continued recovery and the ominous signs out of China) and <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/mar/08/burberry-jumps-5-on-takeover-talk-but-ftse-falls-after-chinese-data\">a 6% surge from Burberry, following some surprising takeover speculation</a></strong>, keeping the FTSE from the lows seen by its European peers.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has become embroiled in the increasingly bitter EU referendum debate after its governor was forced to fend off accusations that Threadneedle Street was being too supportive of the government\u2019s pro-EU line. Mark Carney described as \u201centirely unfounded\u201d the suggestion from the pro-Brexit Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg that the Bank was being politically partisan and jeopardising its reputation for \u201cOlympian detachment\u201d by emphasising the pros but not the cons of EU membership. Giving evidence to MPs on the Treasury select committee, the governor provided backing for David Cameron by warning that there would be short-term costs to the UK from a decision to leave the EU in June \u2013 including weaker investment, lower consumer spending and the relocation of foreign-owned banks to Ireland or continental Europe. Carney said the deal negotiated by Cameron last month had addressed the issues identified by the Bank as necessary to ensure the UK\u2019s monetary and financial stability. However, Carney had to fend off an attack from Rees-Mogg, who said it was \u201cbeneath the dignity\u201d of the governor to be making \u201cspeculative\u201d comments about the beneficial impact of EU membership. The governor responded testily when asked by another Conservative Brexit supporter, Steve Baker, whether the Bank had been put under any pressure by Downing Street to come up with a pro-EU assessment. Carney said his only conversations with the prime minister and the chancellor, George Osborne, had been about the specific issues that affected the Bank\u2019s twin aims of controlling inflation and ensuring financial stability. \u201cI am expressing the views of the Bank,\u201d he added. \u201cWe weren\u2019t leant on by anybody.\u201d The governor said Threadneedle Street took its independence \u201cvery seriously\u201d and said there would have been considerable pushback had the government sought to influence its views. Carney said the Bank wanted to keep out of the political battle over Europe and would not be providing a full assessment of the economic advantages and disadvantages of membership. Nevertheless, his remarks about the possible short-term uncertainty likely in the event of a vote to leave in the referendum on 23 June are likely to be seized upon by the Remain camp. The governor said there could be an impact on the City, depending on the sort of deal the UK struck with its former EU partners in the event of a vote to leave. Some banks were already making contingency plans to relocate, he said. Carney said there was also evidence that the risk of the UK leaving the EU had been one factor pushing down the level of the pound against other currencies and said there would be further turbulence if Brexit occurred. Asked whether the fall in the pound would force the Bank of England to raise interest rates, Carney said Threadneedle Street would need to weigh up the increase in inflation caused by dearer imports and the decrease in inflation caused by both investment and household spending being weaker. The Bank\u2019s assessment was contained in a letter sent by Carney to the Treasury select committee in which he outlined Threadneedle Street\u2019s view of what Brexit would mean for the Bank\u2019s ability to do its job. \u201cThe settlement [reached by Cameron] explicitly recognises the needs of the UK to supervise its financial stability, while not impeding the implementation of necessary, further integration amongst members of the euro area. It makes clear that the UK retains responsibility for supervising its financial stability, financial institutions and markets as well as maintaining responsibility for the resolution of failed financial institutions within its jurisdiction.\u201d The Bank letter adds that the settlement acknowledges that one-size-fits-all legislation affecting the City is not necessarily appropriate for countries, like the UK, that are not going to be part of Europe\u2019s plan for a banking union. \u201cIt recognises that there is more than one currency in the EU and makes a legally binding commitment to ensure non-discrimination in the single market on the basis of currency. Finally, it makes a series of commitments to improve the competitiveness of the EU economy \u2013 commitments, to the extent they are fulfilled, that would reinforce the positive impact of EU membership on the Bank\u2019s secondary objectives.\u201d In his evidence, Carney said it was in the interests of the UK for monetary union to be put on a sounder footing.",

      "bodyText": "As markets fall back after poor Chinese export figures, Burberry is bucking the trend following reports the luxury goods group is preparing defences against a possible bid. A mystery investor was reported to have built up a near 5% stake in Burberry through HSBC. The Financial Times said (\u00a3) the move had prompted the company to ask its advisors, Robey Warshaw and Morgan Stanley, to investigate and help it fight off any takeover attempt. Possible holdes of the stake could be rivals LMVH and US group Coach, private equity or an activist investor. \u201cBurberry is one of the few luxury brands without family interest and thus an easier target for acquisition,\u201d said Macquarie analyst Daniele Gianera told the FT. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said: It appears that Burberry\u2019s challenging trading conditions in the Asia-Pacific region which have weighed on its top line for at least 18 months and pushed the stock down 40% last year (though the shares have since recouped some of that) have attracted opportunistic interest. Burberry could amount to a prize acquisition for what we would regard as its \u2018ideal\u2019 buyer: one with the longest possible horizon with respect to Burberry\u2019s largest non-domestic markets. The reports have sent Burberry shares nearly 5% higher to \u00a314.35, but not everyone is convinced. Analyst Nick Bubb said: As the so-called \u201cmystery\u201d HSBC stake of around 5% in Burberry has been around for some time and includes their fund management holdings, it is not clear why Burberry are on takeover alert, but the City has taken no chances and pushed the share price up. Overall though, a 25% slump in Chinese exports has prompted further worries about the state of the world\u2019s second largest economy, notwithstanding the prospect of further stimulus measures from the country\u2019s central bank. Investors are also nervous ahead of meetings from the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve. So the FTSE 100 is down 46.13 points at 6136.27 as investors cash in after recent gains. Mining shares are, inevitably perhaps after the Chinese disappointment, among the leading fallers. Anglo American is down 46.7p at 581.4p while BHP Billiton has fallen 45.8p to 852p. Worldpay is down 18.2p at 273.7p despite the payments processing group reporting an 8% rise in full year earnings, in line with expectations. But Inmarsat, a weak market after last week\u2019s results, is up 6.5p to 934.5p after the satellite communications group announced an air traffic management contract from the European Space Agency. Tesco has added 5.65p to 197.45p after the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel showed a fall in the rate of its sales decline. The supermarket\u2019s sales slipped 0.8% in the 12 weeks to the end of February compared to a 1.6% fall the previous month.",

      "bodyText": "Npower plans to cut 2,400 jobs \u2013 a fifth of its workforce \u2013 to reduce costs after losing customers, offering bad customer service and suffering poor financial results. The German-owned business, one of Britain\u2019s big six energy providers, said it would cut the jobs in the UK and overseas in the next two years. It employs 11,500 people directly and through outsourced services, 7,500 of whom work directly for Npower in the UK. Npower did not say how many jobs would be lost in the UK but it said the cuts would be made from staff and outsourced workers. It will keep its three British \u201chubs\u201d in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the north-east but the decision to withdraw from many energy services will affect the Midlands most. The number of sites will be cut from 26 so that operations are grouped around the three hubs. The company said the cuts were part of a plan to reduce costs, simplify the business and improve customer service. Unions reacted angrily when news about the job cuts emerged at the weekend. Npower unveiled the job cuts as it announced a loss of \u00a399m at its domestic energy business for 2015 compared with a profit of \u00a3183m a year earlier. It said the loss was caused by intense competition, falling sales volumes and the cost of systems problems that started in 2013. Paul Coffey, the chief executive of npower, said: \u201cWe have looked at every part of npower, and over the next two years we\u2019re fundamentally changing how the company operates. By 2018, around 2,400 fewer people will support npower overall through a mix of those who work directly and indirectly for npower. \u201cI regret that, as we simplify and streamline our activities, this will mean inevitable job losses but I am convinced that these steps are critical to protect the thousands of jobs that will remain.\u201d Npower lost 424,000 customers last year, or about 7% of its business, taking the total to 4.77 million. In December, it was fined \u00a326m for sending out late and often inaccurate bills and failing to handle customer complaints effectively. Ofgem, the energy regulator, said more than 500,000 customers had been affected and npower\u2019s parent, RWE, said the mistakes were embarrassing. Some British households reportedly received multiple bills for varying amounts that did not match meter readings. In other instances the names on bills were incorrect, bills arrived late or not at all. In recent years, npower has closed UK offices and transferred customer service work to India and the outsourcer Capita. The company said its restructuring plan would improve customer service and that customer complaints fell sharply late last year as it got to grips with the problems. As well as persistently low wholesale electricity prices, npower has faced competition from newcomers such as Ovo and First Utility. Its job reductions follow announcements of cuts at Centrica, the owner of British Gas.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) will urgently examine whether allegations CommInsure may be routinely denying legitimate claims from sick and dying customers point to a systemic practice in the insurance industry. On Monday a joint Fairfax-ABC investigation revealed that claims managers at CommInsure, the insurance arm of the Commonwealth Bank, were reportedly delaying claims to dying customers or rejecting them based on outdated, sometimes unobtainable, criteria. CommInsure\u2019s former chief medical officer, Dr Benjamin Koh, told the ABC the insurer would allegedly \u201cblatantly\u201d ask doctors to \u201cplease change it or delete [assessments] so that we can go to someone else to provide another opinion that\u2019s more favourable\u201d. The assistant treasurer, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, said on Tuesday the stories of jilted customers were \u201cvery troubling and shocking\u201d and would be examined by the corporate watchdog. She said: \u201cAsic has advised the government they are looking into the cases that have been raised and we have asked Asic for an urgent report to look at whether the practices that have been raised in the story overnight are more systemic than simply just related to CommInsure.\u201d A Senate inquiry into the financial advice industry, headed by the Nationals senator John Williams, was extended last week to include the $44bn life insurance industry and whether companies \u201care engaging in unethical practices to avoid meeting claims\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer said it would scrutinise the cases raised on Monday\u2019s Four Corners episode. The Commonwealth Bank\u2019s chief executive, Ian Narev, said he was \u201cvery saddened and very disappointed by the experiences of those customers\u201d. He blamed the conduct that, in one instance, saw payments repeatedly delayed to a customer with terminal leukaemia on \u201cexcessive attention paid to the detail of specific process and policies versus taking the bigger picture\u201d. \u201cThat has been rectified,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this business has 4 million customers, it pays out 22,000 claims a year \u2026 The high-level statistics of this business are that it\u2019s doing its job.\u201d But he conceded: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help the individuals whose cases were talked about last night.\u201d Labor\u2019s spokesman for financial services, Jim Chalmers, said the alleged misconduct at CommInsure demanded a royal commission into the industry. \u201cThis is a government very quick to pull the trigger on royal commissions when it relates to the union movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be a test of whether they\u2019re prepared to take the same kind of action when it comes to the disgraceful practices that [have been] highlighted.\u201d Parliament is currently considering a bill to bolster regulation of the life insurance industry, including by scaling back upfront and continuing commission payments. The reforms are the result of an Asic review that found 37% of life insurance advice \u201cfailed to comply with the law\u201d. With upfront commissions the rate rose to 45%. The chief executive of Industry Super Australia, David Whiteley, told the ABC commissions created \u201can incentive for the adviser to make a particular sale rather than providing advice that is just in the client\u2019s best interest\u201d. Calling the Senate inquiry \u201can important first step\u201d, Whiteley said CommInsure\u2019s conduct was the product of a culture that prioritised \u201cselling product to consumers rather than looking at products which are in the interest of those consumers\u201d. The Commonwealth Bank apologised in July 2014 to customers who lost savings as a result of fraudulent and misleading behaviour by its financial advisers. A parliamentary inquiry at the time said the conduct of the bank, and the failure of the regulator to rein it in, were so serious as to warrant a royal commission. In February the bank announced a record half-year profit of $4.62bn.",

      "body": "<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) will urgently examine whether allegations CommInsure may be routinely denying legitimate claims from sick and dying customers point to a systemic practice in the insurance industry.</p> <p>On Monday <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2016/03/07/4417757.htm\">a joint Fairfax-ABC investigation revealed</a> that claims managers at CommInsure, the insurance arm of the Commonwealth Bank, were reportedly delaying claims to dying customers or rejecting them based on outdated, sometimes unobtainable, criteria. </p> <p>CommInsure\u2019s former chief medical officer, Dr Benjamin Koh, told the ABC the insurer would allegedly \u201cblatantly\u201d ask doctors to \u201cplease change it or delete [assessments] so that we can go to someone else to provide another opinion that\u2019s more favourable\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/05/commonwealth-bank-admits-failing-customers-over-heart-attack-claims\">Commonwealth bank admits failing customers over heart attack claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The assistant treasurer, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, said on Tuesday the stories of jilted customers were \u201cvery troubling and shocking\u201d and would be examined by the corporate watchdog.</p> <p>She said: \u201cAsic has advised the government they are looking into the cases that have been raised and we have asked Asic for an urgent report to look at whether the practices that have been raised in the story overnight are more systemic than simply just related to CommInsure.\u201d</p> <p>A Senate inquiry into the financial advice industry, headed by the Nationals senator John Williams, was extended last week to include the $44bn life insurance industry and whether companies \u201care engaging in unethical practices to avoid meeting claims\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer said it would scrutinise the cases raised on Monday\u2019s Four Corners episode.</p> <p>The Commonwealth Bank\u2019s chief executive, Ian Narev, said he was \u201cvery saddened and very disappointed by the experiences of those customers\u201d.</p> <p>He blamed the conduct that, in one instance, saw payments repeatedly delayed to a customer with terminal leukaemia on \u201cexcessive attention paid to the detail of specific process and policies versus taking the bigger picture\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThat has been rectified,\u201d he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/03/commonwealth-bank-boss-apologises-customers-financial-scandal\">Commonwealth Bank boss apologises to customers for financial scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut this business has 4 million customers, it pays out 22,000 claims a year \u2026 The high-level statistics of this business are that it\u2019s doing its job.\u201d</p> <p>But he conceded: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help the individuals whose cases were talked about last night.\u201d</p> <p>Labor\u2019s spokesman for financial services, Jim Chalmers, said the alleged misconduct at CommInsure demanded a royal commission into the industry.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a government very quick to pull the trigger on royal commissions when it relates to the union movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be a test of whether they\u2019re prepared to take the same kind of action when it comes to the disgraceful practices that [have been] highlighted.\u201d</p> <p>Parliament is currently considering a bill to bolster regulation of the life insurance industry, including by scaling back upfront and continuing commission payments.</p> <p>The reforms are the result of an Asic review that found 37% of life insurance advice \u201cfailed to comply with the law\u201d. With upfront commissions the rate rose to 45%.</p> <p>The chief executive of Industry Super Australia, David Whiteley, told the ABC commissions created \u201can incentive for the adviser to make a particular sale rather than providing advice that is just in the client\u2019s best interest\u201d.</p> <p>Calling the Senate inquiry \u201can important first step\u201d, Whiteley said CommInsure\u2019s conduct was the product of a culture that prioritised \u201cselling product to consumers rather than looking at products which are in the interest of those consumers\u201d.</p> <p>The Commonwealth Bank<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/03/commonwealth-bank-boss-apologises-customers-financial-scandal\"> apologised in July 2014</a> to customers who lost savings as a result of fraudulent and misleading behaviour by its financial advisers.</p> <p>A parliamentary inquiry at the time said the conduct of the bank, and the failure of the regulator to rein it in, were so serious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/27/financial-advisers-must-lift-game-after-commonwealth-bank-scandal-says-asic\">as to warrant a royal commission</a>. </p> <p>In February the bank announced a record half-year profit of $4.62bn.</p>",
