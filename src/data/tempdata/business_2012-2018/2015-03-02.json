      "bodyText": "The threat of deflation eased across the eurozone in February following a bounce back from heavy price discounting and steeply declining oil prices during the previous month. The 19-member currency bloc saw prices drop 0.3% last month compared with a drop of 0.6% in January, alleviating fears of an alarming deflationary spiral. Unemployment also fell slightly to give Brussels a double dose of mildly positive economic news ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting later this week in Cyprus, where it is expected to give further details of a \u20ac1.1tn stimulus programme. The jobless rate dipped to 11.2% from 11.3% in January, continuing a slow but steady fall that began in late 2013. But apart from a recovery in the first half of 2011, the rate has been at or above 10% since late 2009. Other data showed that the eurozone manufacturing sector remained lacklustre, with several countries lagging badly behind the rest, giving economists a reason to stay pessimistic about the prospects for a strong recovery in the next year. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said: \u201cThe eurozone manufacturing sector barely expanded in February, highlighting the malaise that still hangs over the region\u2019s goods-producing economy as a whole. However, beneath the disappointing headline figure, different parts of the manufacturing economy are clearly moving at very different speeds, ranging from a [Irish] boom to a [French] slump.\u201d France suffered 10 months of contraction after shrinking at a faster pace in February, according to the Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) survey. The French manufacturing PMI fell to 47.6 last month from 49.2 in January. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. The malaise that has struck French manufacturing industry has distracted from a strong recovery in Spain, where the factory sector posted its fifteenth month of growth. The monthly Spanish manufacturing PMI came in at 54.2, slightly down on January\u2019s 54.7, but still showing a rise in activity. New export orders rose at the fastest pace in almost eight years. Germany posted a modest PMI of 51.1, while Italy saw its factory sector grow for the first time in five months. The Italian manufacturing PMI jumped to 51.9, up from 49.9. The more stable economic outlook contrasts with the volatile political climate that has brought the new radical leftist government in Greece into conflict with Brussels. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who heads the eurozone negotiations with Greece, said that the \u201cfirst disbursement\u201d of the \u20ac7.2bn remaining in Athens\u2019 \u20ac172bn bailout could be released this month.He said it would allow Athens to pay this month\u2019s debt demands, including \u20ac1.4bn owed to the IMF. Dijsselbloem told the Financial Times: \u201cMy message to the Greeks is: try to start the programme even before the whole renegotiation is finished. There are elements that you can start doing today. If you do that, then somewhere in March, maybe there can be a first disbursement. But that would require progress and not just intentions.\u201d Greece\u2019s parliament is due to debate four draft laws this week; tackling the \u201csocial impact\u201d of the country\u2019s austerity programme. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has rebuked Brussels for imposing austerity as the price of the bailout package and in response to the Dutch politician indicated that there could be further battles ahead. Varoufakis said he would refuse the \u20ac7.2bn if it came with strings attached, such as demands to impose further austerity.",

Thus a few examples of naked excess \u2013 like BG Group\u2019s plan to give its incoming chief executive a \u00a325m package \u2013 provoke a revolt. Ask fund managers how much they pay themselves, however, and you will generally get a firm \u201cno comment\u201d. There is no need for the customer \u2013 the investing public \u2013 to know the details, runs the argument. The cost of running a fund and its performance are fully displayed, the defence continues, so publishing fund managers\u2019 pay and bonuses would serve no purpose other than idle titillation. The Institute of Directors disagrees. In robust criticisms of the industry at the weekend, director-general Simon Walker called for more clarity on how fund managers\u2019 salaries are earned. He is right to do so. The worry is twofold. First, fund managers occupy a critical position in the chain linking savers, pensioners and future pensioners to public companies. Their role is not simply to try to pick winning investments and avoid losers. If they are doing their job properly, they are also guardians of good governance, including on matters of pay and incentives, in the interests of general economic wellbeing. It\u2019s hard to lecture against excessive pay, however, if you simultaneously refuse to disclose the basis on which you are paid, let alone how much. To the outside world, the system smacks of one bunch of highly remunerated financial professionals marking the homework of a similarly rewarded crew. In that world, everybody has an interest in not making too much fuss. The second concern is more direct: are fund managers, and their employers, taking their investors for granted? Trade bodies, such as the Investment Association, assure us that pay-for-performance is the norm in their industry, but nobody bothers to publish the details. There is a strong suspicion that, even as the assets pile up, the managers expect their slice to remain fixed for all time. Walker cites research showing that fund managers are taking a constant portion of growing pot. Why aren\u2019t fees falling as investment houses get bigger? Why aren\u2019t the benefits of size being passed on to individuals investors? Pay practices, kept beyond scrutiny, may be one explanation. Walker (salary: \u00a3300,000) calls for more sunlight, saying a Financial Conduct Authority investigation may be required. The IoD, one suspects, is a reasonable touchstone of where public opinion lies. Fund management houses should wake up \u2013 your industry looks too cosy and too opaque, and the outside world has noticed. Chi-Med: a prescription for success Overlooked in last week\u2019s crop of corporate results were full-year numbers from Hutchison China MediTech. Who they? Chi-Med is the creation of Asian billionaire Li Ka-Shing, of Hutchison Whampoa fame. It is an attempt to build a Chinese pharmaceutical company, and progress to date has been impressive. Back in 2009, you could have bought the Aim-listed shares at 50p. The share price today is \u00a313.85, up 15% since last week. About half the company\u2019s value can be attributed to a division that sells and distributes over-the-counter medicines. The more exciting part is drug research and development, where chief executive Christian Hogg predicts Chi-Med will make its first new drug application next year. There are two contenders, both in cancer \u2013 one being developed with Eli Lilly, the other with AstraZeneca. In total, Chi-Med has seven drug candidates in clinical trials, not all in oncology. It\u2019s a high-risk business, of course, but seven shots at developing medicines that might each be capable of $1bn in annual sales makes Chi-Med an intriguing prospect. Success on any would make the current market value of \u00a3720m look cheap, even after the strong run.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The first repainted, rebranded and reprivatised Virgin Trains East Coast train left London Kings Cross station for Edinburgh at 11am on Monday, its new red-and-white livery signalling \u2013 according to one set of politicians and businessmen \u2013 a fresh chapter and better services for passengers. After five years of public ownership, that view is disputed by unions and Labour, for whom East Coast became totemic in the argument over who should run rail transport. Successful and profitable but with its financial returns going to the government rather than shareholders, East Coast\u2019s significance was not lost on the coalition. They put it at the top of the franchising queue ahead of the general election. However, the transport minister Claire Perry, at Kings Cross for Virgin TEC\u2019s official launch, insists: \u201cIt\u2019s been a whipped-up political controversy.\u201d Labour had time in power to change the system had it wished, she says, adding that East Coast under the state-owned Directly Operated Railways (DOR) was never intended to be an ongoing operating company. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t able to make the investments like the \u00a3140m of private sector money that will flow into this franchise.\u201d Over its eight-year franchise the new operator \u2013 a joint venture 90% owned by Stagecoach but with Richard Branson\u2019s licensed brand \u2013 will bring more direct links to the capital and cut journey times after a new fleet of trains is introduced from 2019. The consortium will invest \u00a3140m, partly spent on refurbishing the existing fleet and improving stations. It should also pay \u00a33.3bn in premiums to the Treasury, says David Horne, managing director of Virgin Trains East Coast. \u201cWhen you look at [DOR] paying \u00a31bn in five years, that\u2019s going to be a good deal for taxpayers.\u201d So what exactly is the magic touch that a private operator brings to make this all possible? On the first rebranded train on Monday, Horne says: \u201cIt\u2019s a commitment to customer service.\u201d If that concept seems nebulous, Horne cites a new \u00a33m \u201ccustomers and communities\u201d fund for investments and improvements along the line. \u201cWe\u2019re up for anything. When you bid for a franchise you\u2019re looking forward to think what are customers going to need, but this fund gives a way to do different things that we haven\u2019t thought of that customers may suggest.\u201d The remaining train exteriors will be retouched by August; addressing the ageing interiors will take longer, with refurbishment starting over two years from August. The franchise will include 65 new trains in 2019 under the Intercity Express Programme, ordered by the government from Hitachi, part-manufactured in the new Newton Aycliffe assembly plant in Co Durham. That replacement fleet means 50% more seats and a cut in journey times from London to Edinburgh to four hours. Horne says his firm\u2019s experience will help: \u201cBetween them Stagecoach and Virgin have introduced more trains to the new network than any other operator.\u201d One key contention of private operators\u2019 supporters is that their innovation and customer service has increased passenger numbers. Pressed for specifics, Perry says: \u201cThere will be free Wi-Fi, customer offers. There will be Nectar points. When is the last time that you heard of good old British Rail offering any kind of customer incentives?\u201d Even if the political divide can be encapsulated in a supermarket loyalty programme, the management of East Coast under DOR claims to have \u201crelentlessly focused\u201d on customers (it did, in fact, operate a rewards points scheme). In a valedictory email to stakeholders last week Karen Boswell, the outgoing managing director, trumpeted a record that saw the company garner awards and plaudits. She notes: \u201cWe developed a strong East Coast brand from scratch and we created a relentless focus on the customer throughout our business \u2026 and we\u2019ve been able to achieve one of the highest customer satisfaction ratings of any franchised long-distance operator in the country.\u201d A second argument is that staff will benefit. Perry says: \u201cThe staff on East Coast, I\u2019ve talked to dozens of them, are really excited to be working with two very customer-facing brands.\u201d Horne adds: \u201cOne member said he\u2019d wished we\u2019d taken over years ago, I certainly haven\u2019t detected regret that they\u2019re not working for DOR any more. Most of them are looking forward to working for us because we\u2019re going to provide a lot of investment and opportunities for them in the future: we have plans to invest in customer service training and an overall plan to develop the businesses.\u201d Boswell also claims the support of staff in her email however: \u201cWe made significant investments in our people and assets; and above all, we rekindled a company spirit amongst our people ... we\u2019ve been able to achieve an employee engagement score that is virtually unparalleled in the rail industry.\u201d The last private operator to run the franchise was, briefly, National Express, which handed the keys to DOR in 2009 after failing to meet its payments as the financial crisis hit. Refranchising might finally consign the transport operator\u2019s ignominious moment to history, although Dean Finch, the chief executive who joined in 2010, says: \u201cI don\u2019t believe any journalist is going to let National Express forget that in my lifetime.\u201d He is, unsurprisingly, pro-privatisation: \u201cThe private sector profit take is not taking out a large wedge of money. In return it has contributed a vast amount.\u201d Despite East Coast\u2019s success as one of only two firms to make a net contribution to government coffers over the last two years, its payments exceeding its subsidy, Finch says: \u201cThe reflections on improved service, and punctuality, are only part of the story. [Was] the government getting more back than it would have under the previous contract, more than a private sector operator would have? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Finch says that East Coast had always been a profitable line, with relatively low leasing costs because of the old rolling stock \u2013 making it ripe for any operator. Now, says Horne: \u201cPeople here have looked at what Virgin have done on the West Coast line and are excited by the prospect of a similar transformation of services.\u201d The image he uses is \u201ca hotel on wheels\u201d, adding: \u201cThere are very few commuters on this line \u2013 if people are using it, it\u2019s because they want to, we have to impress them.\u201d The reaction of staff and passengers at York station on Monday was more prosaic, with few changes yet visible to most except the Virgin stickers in the window, new staff badges and plastic Virgin windcheaters concealing old uniforms to keep out the snow showers. One passenger had travelled down from the north-east, but declined to be named, saying: \u201cI\u2019m leftwing so I\u2019d rather they renationalised, but I\u2019m going to get on the train whoever\u2019s running it. I can\u2019t imagine it will make any difference to the service, just the money will be going to different people.\u201d Some staff \u2013 especially on board \u2013 are hopeful for change; others say that the ownership was less of an issue for employees than politicians. One commented: \u201cA job\u2019s a job \u2013 makes no difference, so long as we get paid at the end of the month.\u201d Labour has now pledged to legislate swiftly for rail reform, with Michael Dugher, the shadow transport secretary, describing the end of East Coast trains as \u201ca hammer blow for passengers, taxpayers and employees alike\u201d. Perry\u2019s retort on Monday was firm: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about having a public sector energy company or a public sector airline.\u201d With the once state-owned British Airways\u2019 parent company IAG forecasting \u20ac2.2bn in profits this year, the minister could, however, be on to something. She adds: \u201cI\u2019d like to see the Labour party\u2019s proposal, Dugher Airlines, which I\u2019m sure is coming.\u201d",

I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Finch says that East Coast had always been a profitable line, with relatively low leasing costs because of the old rolling stock \u2013 making it ripe for any operator.</p> <p>Now, says Horne: \u201cPeople here have looked at what Virgin have done on the West Coast line and are excited by the prospect of a similar transformation of services.\u201d The image he uses is \u201ca hotel on wheels\u201d, adding: \u201cThere are very few commuters on this line \u2013 if people are using it, it\u2019s because they want to, we have to impress them.\u201d</p> <p>The reaction of staff and passengers at York station on Monday was more prosaic, with few changes yet visible to most except the Virgin stickers in the window, new staff badges and plastic Virgin windcheaters concealing old uniforms to keep out the snow showers. </p> <p>One passenger had travelled down from the north-east, but declined to be named, saying: \u201cI\u2019m leftwing so I\u2019d rather they renationalised, but I\u2019m going to get on the train whoever\u2019s running it. I can\u2019t imagine it will make any difference to the service, just the money will be going to different people.\u201d Some staff \u2013 especially on board \u2013 are hopeful for change; others say that the ownership was less of an issue for employees than politicians. One commented: \u201cA job\u2019s a job \u2013 makes no difference, so long as we get paid at the end of the month.\u201d</p> <p>Labour has now pledged to legislate swiftly for rail reform, with Michael Dugher, the shadow transport secretary, describing the end of East Coast trains as \u201ca hammer blow for passengers, taxpayers and employees alike\u201d.</p> <p>Perry\u2019s retort on Monday was firm: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about having a public sector energy company or a public sector airline.\u201d With the once state-owned British Airways\u2019 parent company IAG forecasting \u20ac2.2bn in profits this year, the minister could, however, be on to something. She adds: \u201cI\u2019d like to see the Labour party\u2019s proposal, Dugher Airlines, which I\u2019m sure is coming.\u201d <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Continuing concerns about Greece outweighed the prospects of the European Central Bank starting its quantitative easing programme this month, making for an uncertain start to the week for stock markets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 6.02 points lower at 6940.64 after hitting a new intraday peak Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.08% to 11,410.36 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.69% lower at 4917.32 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB slipped 0.18% to 22,297.60 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up just 0.2 points at 11,178.5 In Greece, the Athens market fell 2.45% to 858.95 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 100 points or 0.56% while the Nasdaq Composite - having climbed above 5000 for the first time in 15 years - is now dup 0.46% at 4986. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More talk of a possible third Greek bailout, this time from European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis. Bloomberg reports: Greece could need a third bailout deal when its current program expires in June because markets may still not be prepared to lend to its government, even with a euro-area credit line, Dombrovskis said. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, elected in January, said Friday his government won\u2019t need another bailout. Greece has received pledges of \u20ac240bn in aid from its two rescue packages, and Tsipras\u2019s government must meet creditor demands to tap remaining funds. Speculation over whether Greece would need a third bailout has been swirling for a year or more -- German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said in August 2013 that a new aid program would be needed to help Greece meet its debt obligations -- and estimates of the country\u2019s needs have ranged from \u20ac12bn to \u20ac50bn. In a Monday interview in Riga, Dombrovskis said Tsipras\u2019s government will have to meet the requirements of its current program in coming weeks, and then see what market conditions will dictate. \u201cGreece may need an additional arrangement after this program expires,\u201d said Dombrovskis, whose portfolio includes the euro and monetary union. He said Tsipras faces different conditions from his predecessor, Antonis Samaras, and may not have the same range of options. \u201cWith the previous government, we were discussing how Greece would move back to the market financing with the help of a precautionary arrangement or enhanced-conditions credit line,\u201d Dombrovksis said. \u201cNow this scenario, however, seems less likely, given recent financial instability.\u201d Full story: Greece May Need Third Rescue, EU\u2019s Dombrovskis Says Over in Athens the government decision\u2019s not to put the deal extending Greece\u2019s bailout programme to a vote has brought cries of hypocrisy, reports Helena Smith from Athens: The government had described the accord \u2013 reached after three eurogroups and tortuous negotiations \u2013 as a \u201cgreat victory.\u201d So why would it be opposed to bringing it the 300-seat House for debate? That is the question increasingly being asked tonight after the government spokesman announced that MPs would only be voting on individual bills. \u201cEither the government is afraid to publicly accept what it has signed or it doesn\u2019t have faith in its MPs,\u201d said Kostas Karagounis spokesman of the New Democracy party, until December the dominant force in Greece\u2019s two-party coalition. The KKE communist party also lashed out at the decision arguing there was \u201cno justification\u201d for the accord not to put before a ballot. Not doing so proved, it said, that the government had \u201cthe singular goal of hiding from the Greek people\u201d what it had done: sign up to more laws and anti-austerity measures at the behest of creditors. Former leftwing MP Petros Tatsopoulos told SKAI TV on Monday: \u201cIt is absolute hypocrisy to expect the German parliament to vote on it and not the parliament here in Greece.\u201d The accord has caused ructions within prime minister Alexis Tsipras Syriza party with up to 40% of its central committee members this weekend rejecting the deal outright. Meanwhile: A third Greek bailout is not being discussed among eurozone finance ministers, Reuters is reporting a Eurogroup spokeswoman as saying. Earlier there were reports that Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos had said there were talks about a new package. Back with the US figures and James Knightley says the ISM survey might show a pickup in March after this month\u2019s slightly disappointing number: The ISM manufacturing survey has dropped to 52.9 in February versus 53.5 in January. The consensus prediction was 53.0 so is pretty much in line with expectations, but it is the weakest outcome since January last year. Bad weather may well have depressed activity a little and the West Coast port disruption could also have played a part. Consequently, we expect to see a better number for March. In terms of the details, production fell nearly three points to 53.7 - a 12 month low \u2013 while new orders dropped to its lowest reading since May 2013. There was a pick-up in the backlog of orders, which is a sign of bad weather influencing the report. Export orders deteriorated while the employment component fell nearly three points to the lowest level since June 2013. This is a concern, but the bulk of jobs growth has been driven by services so we will have to wait for Wednesday\u2019s ADP and non-manufacturing ISM employment numbers to see whether there are downside risks to the consensus prediction of a 235,000 increase in non-farm payrolls. The non-farm payroll numbers are due on Friday. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on the comments from Spain\u2019s economy minister on a new Greek bailout package: Spain\u2019s economy minister Luis de Guindos on Monday said eurozone countries were in talks over a third bailout package for Greece worth between \u20ac30bn and \u20ac50bn. Speaking at an event in Pamplona, in northern Spain, de Guindos said the new rescue plan would give more flexible conditions to Greece, which had no alternative other than European solidarity. And the Institute for Supply Management is not as optimistic as the Markit survey of US factories. The ISM said its index of factory activity fell to 52.9 in February from 53.5 the month before, the lowest reading since January 2014. Economists had been expecting a reading of 53.1. But that has not dampened spirits on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up around 88 points or 0.49%. Over in the US, the manufacturing sector jumped in February with factories reporting their best gains since October. The Markit purchasing managers index rose from 53.9 in January to 55.1 last month, compared to an expected level of 54.3, and chief economist Chris Williamson said: Manufacturing braved the cold weather in February, reporting an upturn in the pace of growth. A flurry of activity towards the month end helped raise production to a greater extent than signalled by the earlier flash reading. The upbeat survey points to minimal impact from the adverse weather that affected many parts of the country during the month. While growth of manufacturing output remained below the peaks seen last year, the survey is broadly consistent with production rising at an annualised rate approaching 4%. A survey from ISM is due shortly. There will be a third Greek rescue package of up to \u20ac50bn and Spain will contribute up to 14%, according to comments reportedly made by Spanish economy minister Luis de Guindos. Time for a brisk recap. The latest eurozone economic data has raised hopes that the region\u2019s weak economy is reviving. Unemployment across the eurozone fell by 140,000 people in January, pulling the region\u2019s jobless rate down to 11.2%. Twenty four EU countries reported a drop in unemployment over the last year; it rose in France, Finland and Cyprus, and was flat in Belgium. Fears of a deflationary spiral have also been calmed. Europe\u2019s inflation rate was -0.3% last month, up from -0.6% in January, with falling oil prices to blame. But the recovery remains patchy. New factory data showed that Ireland\u2019s manufacturers grew at the fastest pace since 1999, but France suffered another downturn. Greece\u2019s factories also reported a drop in activity, probably due to political uncertainty. Greece\u2019s bailout drama also continues to loom over the eurozone. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has declared that Greece would rather do without its final \u20ac7.2bn of aid, rather than implement more austerity. Germany\u2019s chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Athens to work on its reform programme, hours after eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem hinted that aid money could be released once Greece makes progress. And a diplomatic rift has opened up after Greece\u2019s new prime minister claimed he was being deliberately undermined by Spain and Portugal. And I\u2019m handing over to Nick Fletcher... Back in Greece, the government has confirmed that parliament will not hold a single yes-or-no vote on its bailout extension. Instead, MPs will vote on individual bills. The European Commission is trying to play peacemaker following Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s claim that Spain and Portugal had lead an \u201can axis of powers\u201d against his government. The AFP newswire reports that both countries have filed a formal complaint with the EC over the comments, prompting Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva to tell reporters in Brussels that: \u201cWe are speaking to all actors involved in order to ensure there is unity among all EU states and especially all EU states of the eurozone,\u201d \u201cWe have received the complaints including a request to comment from the Spanish and Portuguese authorities that was communicated to the Commission over the weekend regarding the statements of Prime Minister Tsipras.\u201d \u201cWe are stressing very much the role of the Commission as a mediator in this process, which means we\u2019re building bridges and bringing parties together.\u201d Newsflashes: German chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Greece to flesh out the reform agenda presented last week. She\u2019s also declared that she wants Greece to enjoy a \u201cgood future\u201d in the eurozone. 02-Mar-2015 12:56 - MERKEL SAYS NOW GREECE NEEDS TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT ITS REFORM PROPOSALS 02-Mar-2015 13:01 - MERKEL SAYS THERE IS NEED FOR STRONGER ECONOMIC POLICY COORDINATION AMONG EURO ZONE MEMBERS The ECB may also revise its economic forecasts for growth and inflation upwards at this week\u2019s meeting. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, explains: With energy prices low and the Euro weak, we expect both real GDP and inflation forecasts to be boosted in the future, mainly 2016 and 2017. While the 2015 real GDP forecast will probably be nudged higher, the 2015 inflation rate will likely not. The European Central Bank\u2019s top policymakers will be pondering Greece\u2019s funding problems when they meet in Cyprus for their two-day meeting, starting on Wednesday. Reuters has a good preview. Here\u2019s a flavour: Shut out of debt markets and faced with a steep fall in tax revenues, Athens is expected to run out of cash by the middle or the end of March. Without unlocking bailout funds by completing -- or at least beginning -- reforms it has vocally opposed, the government faces the prospect of defaulting in a matter of weeks. With other options apparently closed for now, the ECB is central to the Greek government\u2019s only other prospective funding channel: raising a 15 billion euro ($16.82 billion) cap on Athens\u2019 issuance of Treasury bills, or short-term debt. The cap has already been reached, and the ECB has a veto over lifting it. The issue here is that Greek banks have used the T-bills to access central bank funding and then invest in more T-bills, helping the state cover its short-term needs. Raising the T-bill limit would be tantamount to putting central bank cash in the pocket of the Greek government. The ECB is prohibited from such central bank financing of governments. One person familiar with ECB thinking said that any extension of the T-bill limit was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d. More here: ECB uncomfortable with leading role in Greek funding drama European commissioner Pierre Moscovici tweets: Moscovici was previously the finance minister of France - one of just three EU countries where unemployment rose last year... Helena adds that there was some tough talk from Yanis Varoufakis in his radio interview this morning: Varoufakis said the new government would rather dispense with the \u20ac7.2bn outstanding disbursement of aid (yet to be drawn down from its original bailout agreement) if that means continuing with self-defeating austerity. The days of doing everything for the next handout were over, he said. \u201cIf they ask me to continue with the work of austerity I won\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. Over in Athens the Greek finance minister has waded into the row over whether the new government sent the \u201cwrong letter \u201c to Jeroen Dijsselbloem during the bailout negotiations. That\u2019s one claim made by Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup,in that interview with the FT this morning. Helena Smith reports: In his own interview this morning with the Athenian radio station Parapolitika 90.1, Yanis Varoufakis said he was \u201ctrying very hard\u201d to keep quiet about the assertion that Greece has fired off the wrong proposal to the euro group during the month-long negotiations to extend the country\u2019s bailout programme. \u201cI am making a huge effort not to respond to Dijsselbloem. We had our differences but at the last Eurogroup we found common ground. I am now going to go now into an analysis of the moves that happened before,\u201d the Greek finance minister said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the right nor the disposition to do this. At any rate, it was not at all like Dijsselbloem says it was.\u201d Varoufakis has also indicated that Greece might waive the final instalment of its bailout package (even though that would leave it struggling to meet looming debt payments): As this chart shows, eurozone inflation has been on a steadily downward path for the last three years: While the unemployment rate has slowly recovering after plateauing at record highs for most of 2013. Better isn\u2019t the same as good, of course. At 11.2%, Europe\u2019s jobless rate highlights the damage caused by years of austerity since the financial crisis. And the inflation rates also show an economy struggling to create demand. As Bill Adams, senior international economist for PNC Financial Services Group, puts it: With unemployment declining and deflation easing, the latest labor and price data for the Eurozone look less awful. Nonetheless, these data provide little reason to expect the ECB to change its approach toward the risk of trend deflation in the Eurozone. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says today\u2019s data suggests Europe\u2019s economy is picking up: Here\u2019s his take on the fall in unemployment: Unemployment fell for the third month in a row to 11.2% in January \u2013 the lowest figure since April 2012. During the month, the number of people out of work fell by 140,000..... The credit cycle looks to be turning, and a weaker euro should benefit both exporters and domestically-focused firms. And on inflation: Falling energy costs should be of little concern to the ECB \u2013 they are essentially beyond its control, and in any case should prove positive for the euro zone economy as disposable incomes rise. Core CPI inflation, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, remained steady at 0.6%. This is still a worryingly low level, but the fact it didn\u2019t fall further is mildly encouraging. Unemployment rose by just three EU countries over the last year -- Cyprus (15.7% to 16.1%), Finland (8.4% to 8.8%) and France (10.1% to 10.2%). The largest decreases were registered in Spain (25.5% to 23.4%), Estonia (8.5% to 6.4% between December 2013 and December 2014), and Ireland (12.1% to 10.0%), Eurostat says. As usual, the jobless data highlights sharp differences across the Eurozone. The lowest unemployment rates for January were recorded in Germany (4.7%) and Austria (4.8%), and the highest in Greece (25.8% in November 2014) and Spain (23.4%). Europe\u2019s labour market may be turning the corner. The eurozone\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 11.2% in January, down from 11.3% in December. That\u2019s its lowest rate since April 2012. Eurostat reports that the number of unemployed people in the euro area fell by 140,000 in January, meaning 18.059 million were still out of work. Core inflation across the eurozone was unchanged in January at +0.6% The Eurozone\u2019s annual inflation rate inched up to -0.3% last month, showing prices didn\u2019t fall as fast as expected. That\u2019s an improvement on the -0.6% decline in inflation recorded in January. Statistics body Eurostat reports that service sector prices rose by 1.1%, and food, alcohol and tobacco prices rose by 0.5%. So the decline was mainly due to falling energy prices; which should give the eurozone economy a fillip. Fears that Europe is being dragged into a deflationary downturn may have been overstated. The UK factory revival is also being fuelled by domestic demand; overseas orders declined: Growth in Britain\u2019s factory sector has hit a seven-month high, Markit reports. The UK manufacturing PMI rose to 54.1 in February, up from 53.1 in January, suggesting economic conditions picked up last month. One note of caution, though; consumer goods, rather than heavy-duty machinery, led the way. So it\u2019s not a terribly well-balanced recovery: Rob Dobson of Markit explains: \u201cScratching beneath the surface and we see a lop- sided upturn, with the prime driver being a strong upsurge in new orders and production at consumer goods producers while a near-stalling of demand for plant and machinery points to ongoing weak business investment. Italy\u2019s unemployment rate fell last month, away from the record highs hit last year, but remains worryingly high. The Italian jobless rate dropped to 12.6% in January, down from 12.7% in December. It struck 13.2% last autumn, as the country slipped back into recession. And the youth unemployment rate remains over 40%; depression-era levels. Greece\u2019s manufacturing sector shrank last month, as the political turmoil around January\u2019s general election hits its economy. Data firm Markit just reported that the Greek factory PMI came in at 48.4, up slightly from 48.3 in January, but still signalling a contraction in activity. Factory output hit its lowest point in 16 months, as new orders shrank. Markit said there was \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d showing that political uncertainty had a disruptive impact on demand Phil Smith, Economist at Markit, adds: \u201cThe headline manufacturing PMI remained in contraction territory in February in a further sign that Greece\u2019s economy continues to struggle under the weight of uncertainty. Factories reported hesitancy among clients at home and abroad to commit to new orders, leading new business inflows to fall at an accelerated rate\u201d There is one optimistic sign, though. The survey showed a further rise in employment at Greek factories. The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector only posted a little growth in February, according to Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck. But that hides some remarkable national differences. While Ireland posted its biggest jump in activity since 1999 [see here], French factories suffered yet another contraction. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson says: \u201cThe euro zone manufacturing sector barely expanded in February, highlighting the malaise that still hangs over the region\u2019s goods-producing economy as a whole.\u201d \u201cHowever, beneath the disappointing headline figure, different parts of the manufacturing economy are clearly moving at very different speeds, ranging from an (Irish) boom to a (French) slump.\u201d The overall eurozone manufacturing PMI came in at 51.0, just over the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Nice to see Italy performing well too: Once again Germany has outperformed France. Eugh. France\u2019s factory output shrank at a faster pace in February. Markit reports that the French manufacturing PMI fell to 47.6 last month from 49.2 in January; deeper into contraction territory. Good news from Italy -- its factory sector has grown for the first time in five months. The Italian manufacturing PMI jumped to 51.9, up from 49.9. Any reading over 50 shows the sector expanded. So this might suggest that Italy\u2019s long stagnation is ending.... Europe\u2019s two largest stock markets have nudged fresh record highs this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 has just hit a fresh intraday high of 6970, as investors anticipate the launch of the European Central Bank\u2019s new quantitative easing programme this month. Germany\u2019s DAX has also nudged a new peak: Spain\u2019s factory sector has posted its fifteenth month of growth. The monthly Spanish manufacturing PMI, measured by Markit, came in at 54.2; slightly down on January\u2019s 54.7, but still showing a rise in activity. New export orders rose at the fastest pace in almost eight years. Britain\u2019s housing market appears to be cooling. Prices fell by 0.1% in February, dragging down the annual rate of price inflation to 5.7%, from 6.8% in January. This slowdown means that the average price of a UK home has fallen back to \u00a3187,964, from the recent peak of \u00a3189,306 it reached in August. Here\u2019s the full story: UK house prices fall 0.1% in February Jeroen Dojsselbloem, who led the talks with Greece over its bailout plan last month, has dangled a carrot towards Athens -- crack on with reforms, and we may release some funds this months. Interviewed by the Financial Times, eurogroup chief Dijssesbloem said that the \u201cfirst disbursement\u201d of the \u20ac7.2bn remaining in Athens\u2019 \u20ac172bn bailout could be released this month. That would help it handle some of this month\u2019s debt demands, including \u20ac1.4bn owed to the IMF. Dijssesbloem said: \u201cMy message to the Greeks is: try to start the programme even before the whole renegotiation is finished.\u201d \u201cThere are elements that you can start doing today. If you do that, then somewhere in March, maybe there can be a first disbursement. But that would require progress and not just intentions.\u201d Greece\u2019s parliament is due to debate four draft laws this week; tackling the \u201csocial impact\u201d of the country\u2019s austerity programme. More here: Greece warned to start reforms to gain cash (\u00a3) Greece\u2019s prime minister has caused a diplomatic spat over the weekend by claiming that Spain and Portugal had led \u201can axis of powers\u201d against the new Athens government. Alexis Tsipras told an audience that Madrid and Lisbon were afraid of their own radical parties [eg: Spain\u2019s Podemos], declaring: Their plan was, and is, to wear down, topple or bring our government to unconditional surrender before our work begins to bear fruit and before the Greek example affects other countries\u2026 And mainly before the elections in Spain.\u201d That earned a rapid rebuke from Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, who insisted Tsipras\u2019s problems are his own making: \u201cWe are not responsible for the frustration generated by the radical Greek left that promised the Greeks something it couldn\u2019t deliver on,\u201d he said. More here: Alexis Tsipras comes under fire from Spanish prime minister Ireland\u2019s recovery from its bailout woes continues; its manufacturing sector posted its biggest jump in monthly activity since December 1999. Markit, which compiles the report, says firms reported a rise in new orders from both domestic and export clients, and a sharp increase in employment. That won\u2019t hurt Ireland\u2019s reputation as the \u2018poster boy\u2019 for eurozone austerity. Activity across China\u2019s factory sector nudged to a seven-month high last month, data released earlier today shows. But it\u2019s not all good news; today\u2019s PMI survey also shows that export orders fell for the first time in 10 months. Firms also continued to cut staff, suggesting China is suffering from weaker demand from overseas. The data comes hours after China\u2019s central bank announced an interest rate cut, the second since November. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a sense that Europe is returning to normality this week (at least for a moment), after the recent drama over Greece\u2019s bailout extension. But normality, in European terms, means fretting about weak growth, low inflation and record joblessness. A flurry of manufacturing data this morning is likely to show that factory growth in France and Italy remains weak. Then at 10am GMT (11am CET), the latest consumer prices index data is likely to show that prices kept falling in February. The headline inflation rate is tipped to come in at -0.5%, compared with -0.6% in January -- due to falling oil costs and weak demand. The latest unemployment data, for January, is also likely to show little progress in fixing Europe\u2019s labour market. Economists think the eurozone jobless rate was unchanged at 11.4%, while Italy could be as high as 12.9%. There\u2019s also UK data to watch out for; including the latest health-check of Britain\u2019s factories. Not that Greece\u2019s particular crisis is fixed, of course, just because Athens has been given a four-month bailout extension by its creditors. The Greek government is due to propose legislation this week to implement reform programmes, in a bid to win bailout money from its creditors.

There was a pick-up in the backlog of orders, which is a sign of bad weather influencing the report.</p> <p>Export orders deteriorated while the employment component fell nearly three points to the lowest level since June 2013.

The issue here is that Greek banks have used the T-bills to access central bank funding and then invest in more T-bills, helping the state cover its short-term needs.</p> <p>Raising the T-bill limit would be tantamount to putting central bank cash in the pocket of the Greek government.

Controversial online retailer <a href=\"http://amazon.co.uk/\">Amazon.co.uk</a> is out of favour and has dropped out of the Top 20.</p> <p>High street chemist Boots moved up two places from 15th to 13th.</p> <p>Newer brands \u2013 such as social media giants Facebook and Twitter \u2013 have continued to be absent from the top group, making few inroads in the overall rankings. Equally, technology giant Google continued its slide, falling from seventh to 18<sup>th</sup> place. This represents Google\u2019s third consecutive fall and its biggest to date \u2013 the brand had previously never placed lower than seventh.</p> <p>Despite mixed fortunes for the technology giants, Apple climbed back up four places from 14th to 10th, boosted by the success of the latest iPhones. Microsoft climbed up two places from sixth to fourth place, arresting its slide.<br></p> <p>Elsewhere, low-cost household names continue to perform well with Andrex, Coca-Cola, Gillette and Kellogg\u2019s retaining their positions in the top 20. Equally, H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Fairy were voted into the leading group, replacing Cadbury and Heinz.</p> <p>Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive of The Centre for Brands Analysis and chairman of the Superbrands Council said: \u201cYounger brands, such as the social media giants, are sitting on the sidelines making little impact as a huge battle takes place among trusted, traditional brands seeking to remain relevant and retain their positions among the brand elite.

      "bodyText": "British Airways has held on to its title as the UK\u2019s leading consumer \u2018superbrand\u2019 as some of the oldest and most trusted household names including Cadbury, Heinz and Marks &amp; Spencer dropped out of the list of favourite brands. The flag carrier trumped more than 1,500 companies to stay at the top of the annual ranking of brand strength in the UK, and as names such as John Lewis, Lego and H\u00e4agen-Dazs \u2013 now mainstays of British daily life \u2013 appeared at the top of the elite grouping. Dyson and Virgin Atlantic are also new entries in the top 20 most popular big brands, a list based on an annual survey of 2,500 UK shoppers carried out by market analysts at the Centre for Brand Analysis, on behalf of Superbrands. Reflecting the changing world of retail, Britain\u2019s favourite underwear retailer, Marks &amp; Spencer, fell out of the top 20 for the first time since 2009, in a move which analysts saw as a \u201csteady erosion of goodwill\u201d. To make matters worse for M&amp;S, its rival John Lewis has re-entered the top 20 for the first time since 2012, reaching a respectable sixth position. Controversial online retailer Amazon.co.uk is out of favour and has dropped out of the Top 20. High street chemist Boots moved up two places from 15th to 13th. Newer brands \u2013 such as social media giants Facebook and Twitter \u2013 have continued to be absent from the top group, making few inroads in the overall rankings. Equally, technology giant Google continued its slide, falling from seventh to 18th place. This represents Google\u2019s third consecutive fall and its biggest to date \u2013 the brand had previously never placed lower than seventh. Despite mixed fortunes for the technology giants, Apple climbed back up four places from 14th to 10th, boosted by the success of the latest iPhones. Microsoft climbed up two places from sixth to fourth place, arresting its slide. Elsewhere, low-cost household names continue to perform well with Andrex, Coca-Cola, Gillette and Kellogg\u2019s retaining their positions in the top 20. Equally, H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Fairy were voted into the leading group, replacing Cadbury and Heinz. Stephen Cheliotis, chief executive of The Centre for Brands Analysis and chairman of the Superbrands Council said: \u201cYounger brands, such as the social media giants, are sitting on the sidelines making little impact as a huge battle takes place among trusted, traditional brands seeking to remain relevant and retain their positions among the brand elite. British Airways retaining number one spot is a great example of a much-loved traditional brand that has also refreshed, refocused on innovation and invested to remain attractive and relevant. It is winning out while newer innovators, such as Google, go in reverse, as the shine comes off.\u201d In a parallel exercise, British Airways came top of the Business Superbrands ranking, in a move hailed by Cheliotis as \u201can incredible achievement\u201d.

      "bodyText": "First-time buyers have been warned that they face increasing competition for properties as figures showed that buy-to-let landlords are looking for mortgages with deposits averaging almost \u00a3100,000. Data from the Mortgage Advice Bureau (MAB) based on searches through the UK\u2019s main price comparison sites showed that in the final quarter of 2014, people searching for a buy-to-let mortgage typically said they had \u00a399,914 in equity to put down. The figures include remortgages and new loans taken out to buy properties; according to mortgage lenders, in 2014 the market divided roughly in half between the two. The amount of equity that buy-to-let landlords had was 15% higher than at this time last year, suggesting many have benefited from rising house prices. Savings provider Scottish Friendly suggested first-time buyers \u201chave just months left to buy a house or risk missing out on the chance of getting on the property ladder for years to come\u201d. The group, which offers insurance and investment products, said the imminent relaxation of pension rules in April meant newcomers to the market would be competing for properties with those retiring and keen to invest their funds in bricks and mortar. \u201cThe baby-boomer generation has always had an unhealthy obsession with property,\u201d said Neil Lovatt, director at Scottish Friendly. \u201cThis has been manageable, even beneficial to the economy when people slowly climbed the property ladder. But the new pension rules will essentially bankroll a generation, allowing them to buy into an already over-inflated market in the expectation that it will help fund their retirement.\u201d MAB\u2019s figures, which are based on 250,000 mortgage searches a month, of which arbout a quarter are for buy-to-let loans, showed landlords were typically seeking to borrow \u00a3129,964 of a \u00a3229,878 purchase price. This meant an average loan to value of 56.5%, allowing them to secure mortgage rates as low as 1.99%. Brian Murphy, head of lending at MAB, said: \u201cHouse prices have settled into a steadier pattern in recent months, but the current low rate environment offers many buy-to-let borrowers the chance to reassess their finances. \u201cIt means this part of the market is likely to see strong activity this year, both from people who are already involved with BTL and others who are learning the ropes.\u201d There was some good news for first-time buyers, as Nationwide\u2019s latest monthly house price index showed a 0.1% fall in February and an easing off in the annual rate of growth. However separate figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals rose for the second consecutive month in January, prompting some experts to predict house prices will start rising again soon. The Nationwide report showed the annual rate of price inflation fell for the sixth month running to stand at 5.7% \u2013 less than half the 11.8% rate in June 2014 and its lowest level for 16 months. The average price of a UK home has fallen back to \u00a3187,964, from the recent peak of \u00a3189,306 in August. Nationwide\u2019s figures, which are based on home loans it has approved during the month and adjusted to reflect a typical house, are the first to show prices for February. They are in line with other indicators that have shown waning interest from buyers and a change of mood from a year ago when prices in London and south-east England were spiralling upwards. Bank of England figures showed mortgage approvals continued to rise in January to hit a four-month high. There were 60,786 loans approved for home purchase, up from 60,349 in December. Matthew Pointon, a property economist at the thinktank Capital Economics, said the housing market appeared to be nearing a turning point. \u201cHouse prices held their ground in February according to the Nationwide. But with mortgage approvals rising for the second consecutive month, and mortgage rates dropping yet again, prices will soon return to a gentle upwards trend,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "British manufacturers enjoyed a pickup in business last month but they relied on domestic demand as exports fell against the backdrop of a troubled eurozone and stronger pound. A closely watched survey showed factories continued to enjoy a bounceback after a slow finish to 2014. But details showed little progress in the government\u2019s push to rebalance the economy away from over-reliance on domestic consumer demand. The main balance rose to a seven-month high of 54.1 in February\u2019s Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI. That was up from 53.1 in January and well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction. It was also higher than the 53.4 consenus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. The report showed manufacturers continued to add jobs to keep up with rising demand from UK-based clients. But export orders fell as a stronger pound made UK goods more expensive for some foreign buyers and as worries about deflation and Greece\u2019s debt deal continued to weigh on confidence in the UK\u2019s key market, the eurozone. Surveys from the same compiler on eurozone manufacturers earlier on Monday showed the manufacturing sector in the currency bloc only posted a little growth in February. The UK report also fanned fears that the UK economy could lose steam later this year and the makeup of demand echoed official data last week showing investment spending fell at the fastest rate in almost six years at the end of 2014. The manufacturing report showed some help for factories from falling costs as the sharp drop in oil prices in recent months continued to filter through to them. Manufacturers also cut the prices they charged for their products for the second month running. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said the survey reinforced a picture of a broader revival in the UK at the start of the year. It also suggested job creation for manufacturing is running at a rate of 5,000 new positions filled a month, he said. But he added: Scratching beneath the surface and we see a lopsided upturn, with the prime driver being a strong upsurge in new orders and production at consumer goods producers while a near-stalling of demand for plant and machinery points to ongoing weak business investment. Separately, the appreciation of sterling is holding back the progress of UK exporters. It seems that, despite years of talk about a rebalancing of growth, we are still seeing only limited headway in moving away from consumer-driven expansions and towards a greater contribution from exports. The coalition has argued that in order to secure a sustainable future, the UK economy must rebalance away from debt-fuelled consumer spending and towards more manufacturing and exports. However, little progress has been made and the British Chambers of Commerce believes the chancellor\u2019s target set in 2012 to double UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020 looks out of reach. But manufacturers have appeared relatively upbeat in recent surveys. The PMI report follows a poll earlier on Monday from the manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF suggesting the sector had enjoyed a strong start to the year. Export orders were growing and some firms reported a pickup in demand from European customers. The survey of 400 firms from the EEF also suggested that investment plans continued to look robust and more small and medium-sized firms were expecting to hire in the next quarter. Manufacturing makes up only a tenth of the UK economy and so analysts are waiting for the PMI survey on the dominant services sector out on Wednesday to get a better read on overall growth. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said Monday\u2019s report was an encouraging start. Services should presumably do even better since the consumer is facing a windfall from lower petrol and food prices which is likely to be spent. It\u2019s a bit like winning a lottery scratch card rather than a euro millions payout but the point is it\u2019s a positive and should help push the pace of quarterly GDP [growth] upwards over the course of the year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Leading shares are continuing their record breaking run, buoyed by a rise in mining shares after China cut interest rates over the weekend. The move by the Chinese central bank came amid concerns about a slowdown in the country\u2019s economy although the latest HSBC purchasing managers index showed the factory sector edged to a seven-month high in February although exports fell back. Meanwhile, with another mixed picture from the eurozone economy, investors are also awaiting the European Central Bank\u2019s proposed quantitative easing programme to begin this month. So the FTSE 100 has added 22.26 points to 6968.92, a new intra-day high. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said: China has done its best to start the week off on a positive note with its slightly better-than-expected manufacturing figures and the Chinese central bank\u2019s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. This cut sees China reduce interest rates down to 5.35% and become the 17th nation to cut rates this year. Expectations are also high that Australia will cut its rates again tomorrow. However, somewhat less cheerily, this action does point towards the Asian powerhouse cutting its growth rate outlook down to 7% for the year ahead. Although pre-market calls had pointed to a soft open, the FTSE has quickly shaken off this malaise and again looks to be threatening the 7000 level.

    "webTitle": "The worst wages growth in 20 years is Joe Hockey's 'good news'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last Thursday, during question time, Joe Hockey was asked to \u201coutline how the government is building jobs, growth and opportunity and how will this assist all Australians.\u201d Bizarrely, he chose to respond by suggesting \u201cthere has been more good news today\u201d in reference \u201caverage weekly earnings\u201d, despite Australians\u2019 earnings growing by less now than they have for more than 20 years. In delivering the \u201cgood news\u201d Hockey told parliament that \u201cthe average wage in Australia has now increased to $76,800 a year. It increased by 2.8% this year\u201d. He noted this meant the average wage for Australians \u201cworks out at $1,476.30 a week\u201d. Firstly, Hockey got a bit confused. The 2.8% growth referred to the original data, while the $1,476.30 referred to the trend data \u2013 which only grew by 2.7%. He was referring to full-time employment only, not the average earnings of all workers \u2013 that is just $1,128.90 a week. But what is worse is the treasurer\u2019s suggestion that these growth figures were in any way \u201cgood news\u201d. They were, in fact, terrible. The 2.8% growth (or 2.7%, to use the trend data) was the third-worst annual growth going back to 1994. And the worst result occurred in the 12 months to May 2014 which saw just 2.4% growth: And had Hockey referred to the average growth earnings for all workers, rather than just full-time workers, he would have been boasting about the \u201cgood news\u201d of just 1.3% annual growth \u2013 the lowest growth since August 1999. But rather than note this poor performance, Hockey instead argued that \u201cwith the higher wages comes greater prosperity\u201d. Now certainly higher wages does as a rule mean greater prosperity \u2013 for generally it will mean there is stronger jobs growth and greater demand for workers and thus, all in all, a stronger economy. But right now, by his own definition, Hockey is presiding over the worst period of rising prosperity this century in over 20 years! Moreover, the weekly earnings figures that he refers to don\u2019t actually measure \u201cwages\u201d but \u201caverage earnings\u201d. If you work for $15 an hour and this week you worked five more hours than last week, your earnings will have risen, but your wage would not. To look at actual wages growth, the best measure is the ABS\u2019s wages price index \u2013 as this attempts to look at actual increases in wage rates rather than earnings which may be affected by hours worked. The latest figures were also released last week. The annual growth of 2.5% was the lowest since the ABS began calculating the rate in 1998: If strong wages growth is good news, then Hockey best keep quiet. To give an idea of how weak wages growth is at the moment, since 1998 quarterly wages growth in trend terms has only been below 0.7% six times; three of those six times have occurred in the past three quarters; and five of them have occurred in the past seven: What is also important when looking at wages is how fast they are growing compared with inflation. If they are rising faster than inflation then \u201creal wages\u201d are growing \u2013 because it means you are able to buy more things with your wages than you could a year ago. Right now real wages are barely growing above inflation and they have grown by less than the 0.7% along term average since March 2013. This is important because while Hockey was bizarrely gloating about strong wages growth, in Senate estimates last week, senators Abetz and Bernardi were equally bizarrely trying to suggest that proposed wage rises to public servants \u2013 which are well below inflation \u2013 are actually generous. Public sector wages growth in the past year was 2.7% \u2013 the equal lowest on record. The growth of wages for public servants in the ACT \u2013 a good proxy for commonwealth public servants \u2013 was just 1.4%, the second lowest 12-month period ever (the lowest was recorded three months ago). During the estimates hearings, Abetz and Bernardi worked with the new public service commissioner, John Lloyd, to come up with some truly idiotic short-term logic to calculate inflation and low pay offers for commonwealth public servants, such as the 3.16% over three years rise offered to those working in the Department of Defence, the 0.8% annual pay rise offered to those working for the Australian Taxation Office, or the mere 1.4% rise over three years offered to those working for Abetz\u2019s own Department of Employment. Lloyd, who was appointed to the post in December and who previously worked as a director for the rightwing Institute of Public Affairs, is not someone you would say unions see eye-to-eye with, but it was still disappointing to see him go along with the idiocy on low wages served up to him by senators Bernardi and Abetz last Monday. Bernardi and Abetz suggested that because the Reserve Bank was estimating inflation to June this year would grow by just 1.25%, the government\u2019s policy that no public servant would receive a pay rise over the next three years of above 1.5% would in some cases see wage rises that \u201cat least matches inflation\u201d or even \u201cexceed inflation\u201d. Bernardi even argued that a pay rise of \u201caround 2% or 2.5% would be substantially in excess of inflation\u201d. \u201cIt would,\u201d he argued, \u201cbe twice the inflation rate.\u201d To this Lloyd replied, \u201cYes, a 2% increase, of course, is well ahead of inflation, yes.\u201d The problem for Bernardi, Lloyd and Abetz is that they only bothered to look forward to the rate of inflation three months to June \u2013 ignoring that three years is rather longer than three months. Yes, the RBA did indeed predict in its latest Statement on Monetary Policy that inflation in June 2015 would be 1.25%, but a three years wage agreement goes out to the end of 2017 at least. Conveniently for us, if not for Bernardi, Lloyd and Abetz, the RBA also estimated inflation out to December 2017. It estimated inflation for both 2016 and 2017 to be between 2.25% and 3.25% \u2013 for a mid-point of 2.75%, which means Bernardi\u2019s assertion that wage rises of \u201caround 2% or 2.5% would be substantially in excess of inflation\u201d or \u201ctwice the inflation rate\u201d is complete crap. The only reason inflation is so low right now is because in the past six months petrol prices have fallen around 10%, and because the current inflation rate includes the fall in power prices due to the removal of the carbon price in the September 2014 quarter. But after September 2015, that impact will be gone from the annual growth figures \u2013 and it actually has no current impact on quarterly growth. Most economists expect inflation over the next few years to be below 3%. But suggesting a rise in wages of 1.25% over the next three years will be in line with inflation is to live in a fantasy world. For a start, the RBA would not let inflation remain so low for so long as it is well below its target band of 2%-3%. Hockey may truly believe that wage rises are good news. If so, I hope he does something about increasing the current pathetic wage growth. In the first instance he could have a word with his cabinet colleague and point out that no matter how much you spin it, wage rises below the inflation rate do not provide workers with \u201cgreater prosperity\u201d.",

And the worst result occurred in the 12 months to May 2014 which saw just 2.4% growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/minWL/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And had Hockey referred to the average growth earnings for all workers, rather than just full-time workers, he would have been boasting about the \u201cgood news\u201d of just 1.3% annual growth \u2013 the lowest growth since August 1999. </p> <p>But rather than note this poor performance, Hockey instead argued that \u201cwith the higher wages comes greater prosperity\u201d. </p> <p>Now certainly higher wages does as a rule mean greater prosperity \u2013 for generally it will mean there is stronger jobs growth and greater demand for workers and thus, all in all, a stronger economy. </p> <p>But right now, by his own definition, Hockey is presiding over the worst period of rising prosperity this century in over 20 years!</p> <p>Moreover, the weekly earnings figures that he refers to don\u2019t actually measure \u201cwages\u201d but \u201caverage earnings\u201d. If you work for $15 an hour and this week you worked five more hours than last week, your earnings will have risen, but your wage would not. </p> <p>To look at actual wages growth, the best measure is the ABS\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6345.0/\">wages price index</a> \u2013 as this attempts to look at actual increases in wage rates rather than earnings which may be affected by hours worked.</p> <p>The latest figures were also released last week. The annual growth of 2.5% was the lowest since the ABS began calculating the rate in 1998:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/YYzUm/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>If strong wages growth is good news, then Hockey best keep quiet. </p> <p>To give an idea of how weak wages growth is at the moment, since 1998 quarterly wages growth in trend terms has only been below 0.7% six times; three of those six times have occurred in the past three quarters; and five of them have occurred in the past seven:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/f26ZG/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>What is also important when looking at wages is how fast they are growing compared with inflation. If they are rising faster than inflation then \u201creal wages\u201d are growing \u2013 because it means you are able to buy more things with your wages than you could a year ago. </p> <p>Right now real wages are barely growing above inflation and they have grown by less than the 0.7% along term average since March 2013. This is important because while Hockey was bizarrely gloating about strong wages growth, in <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Festimate%2Fa6531538-554f-4a0e-b60f-af9d4448d5d8%2F0008%22\">Senate estimates</a> last week, senators Abetz and Bernardi were equally bizarrely trying to suggest that proposed wage rises to public servants \u2013 which are well below inflation \u2013 are actually generous. </p> <p>Public sector wages growth in the past year was 2.7% \u2013 the equal lowest on record. The growth of wages for public servants in the ACT \u2013 a good proxy for commonwealth public servants \u2013 was just 1.4%, the second lowest 12-month period ever (the lowest was recorded three months ago).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/J0W5y/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>During the estimates hearings, Abetz and Bernardi worked with the new public service commissioner, John Lloyd, to come up with some truly idiotic short-term logic to calculate inflation and low pay offers for commonwealth public servants, such as the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/defence-bureaucrats-stung-by-meagre-pay-offer-20150219-13jlz3.html\">3.16% over three years</a> rise offered to those working in the Department of Defence, the <a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/anger-spreads-australian-taxation-office-moves-toward-industrial-action-20150220-13ki1y.html\">0.8% annual pay rise</a> offered to those working for the Australian Taxation Office, or the mere <a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/employment-public-servants-plan-to-get-in-the-face-of-their-minister-eric-abetz-with-cpsu-action-20150225-13ocui.html\">1.4% rise over three years</a> offered to those working for Abetz\u2019s own Department of Employment.</p> <p>Lloyd, who was appointed to the post <a href=\"http://www.apsc.gov.au/about-the-apsc/the-public-service-commissioner\">in December</a> and who previously worked as a director for the rightwing Institute of Public Affairs, is not someone you would say unions see eye-to-eye with, but it was still disappointing to see him go along with the idiocy on low wages served up to him by senators Bernardi and Abetz <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A\">last Monday</a>. </p> <p>Bernardi and Abetz suggested that because the Reserve Bank was estimating inflation to June this year would grow by just 1.25%, the government\u2019s policy that no public servant would receive a pay rise over the next three years of above 1.5% would in some cases see wage rises that \u201cat least matches inflation\u201d or even \u201cexceed inflation\u201d.</p> <p>Bernardi even argued that a pay rise of \u201caround 2% or 2.5% would be substantially in excess of inflation\u201d. \u201cIt would,\u201d he argued, \u201cbe twice the inflation rate.\u201d</p> <p>To this Lloyd replied, \u201cYes, a 2% increase, of course, is well ahead of inflation, yes.\u201d</p> <p>The problem for Bernardi, Lloyd and Abetz is that they only bothered to look forward to the rate of inflation three months to June \u2013 ignoring that three years is rather longer than three months. </p> <p>Yes, the RBA did indeed predict in its latest <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2015/feb/html/index.html\">Statement on Monetary Policy</a> that inflation in June 2015 would be 1.25%, but a three years wage agreement goes out to the end of 2017 at least. </p> <p>Conveniently for us, if not for Bernardi, Lloyd and Abetz, the RBA also <a href=\"#table-6.1\">estimated inflation out to December 2017</a>. </p> <p>It estimated inflation for both 2016 and 2017 to be between 2.25% and 3.25% \u2013 for a mid-point of 2.75%, which means Bernardi\u2019s assertion that wage rises of \u201caround 2% or 2.5% would be substantially in excess of inflation\u201d or \u201ctwice the inflation rate\u201d is complete crap. </p> <p>The only reason inflation is so low right now is because in the past six months petrol prices have fallen around 10%, and because the current inflation rate includes the fall in power prices due to the removal of the carbon price in the September 2014 quarter. But after September 2015, that impact will be gone from the annual growth figures \u2013 and it actually has no current impact on quarterly growth. </p> <p>Most economists expect inflation over the next few years to be below 3%. But suggesting a rise in wages of 1.25% over the next three years will be in line with inflation is to live in a fantasy world. For a start, the RBA would not let inflation remain so low for so long as it is well below its target band of 2%-3%. </p> <p>Hockey may truly believe that wage rises are good news. If so, I hope he does something about increasing the current pathetic wage growth. In the first instance he could have a word with his cabinet colleague and point out that no matter how much you spin it, wage rises below the inflation rate do not provide workers with \u201cgreater prosperity\u201d.</p>",

A survey of members of the Institute of Directors (IoD), a business lobby group, found that 52% of companies see \u201canger over senior levels of executive pay\u201d as a threat to public trust in business, ahead of 51% identifying product mis-selling or the unsympathetic portrayal of business in the media as problems. The survey, carried out on behalf of the High Pay Centre thinktank, will up the pressure on political parties to tackle executive pay in their general election manifestoes. Shareholders were given the power to veto proposed executive pay packages in 2013, but top pay has continued to prove controversial. Last week HSBC revealed that chief executive Stuart Gulliver received \u00a37.6m in pay and bonuses in 2014, despite a slump in profits and a deepening row over tax avoidance at the group\u2019s Swiss banking arm. The boss of Lloyds Banking Group, which was rescued by the taxpayer during the financial crisis, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, was handed \u00a311.5m in pay and share bonuses last year. The IoD survey showed 48% of firms either agreed or strongly agreed that falling trust in business was an important threat to the success of their own company, while 26% did not think it was important. Simon Walker, IoD director general, said performance-related pay can be a key driver of success. But, he added: \u201cIn some corners of corporate Britain pay for top executives has become so divided from performance that it cannot be justified. Runaway pay packages, golden hellos, and inflammatory bonuses are running the reputation of business into the ground. Large companies need to look closely at the role excessive pay is playing in fuelling an anti-business backlash from the public and some politicians.\u201d Analysis by the High Pay Centre suggests that the pay of a FTSE 100 CEO is now around 160 times the average full-time UK worker, compared with about 60 times in the late 1990s. FTSE 100 bosses are paid an average \u00a34.7m and have already made more money in 2015 than most UK workers will earn all year. Median earnings for full-time workers in the UK, who had been in their job for at least 12 months, were \u00a327,200 in 2014. Deborah Hargreaves, the thinktank\u2019s director, said: \u201cThese findings destroy the argument that criticism of excessive executive pay is somehow \u2018anti-business.\u2019 Outside the boardrooms of big corporations, ordinary small and medium-sized business owners are as appalled by the culture of top pay as anybody else.",
