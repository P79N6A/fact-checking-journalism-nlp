Some are just changing the nameplates on the executive suite door; others are trying to complete turnaround plans or maintain strong growth</strong></p> <h2>Moya Greene </h2> <p><strong>Chief executive, Royal Mail </strong></p> <p><strong>Sector: Distribution</strong></p> <p>Royal Mail will continue to be the focus of public and political attention next year following its controversial flotation on the stock market.</p> <p>The furore surrounding the company being sold off on the cheap \u2013 the shares were sold at 330p and soared by 38% on the first day and are now changing hands at 578.5p \u2013 has been centred on the business secretary, Vince Cable, whose department presided over the sell-off, and not Greene who had no role in the pricing decision.</p> <p>Greene delivered a 147% increase in half-year pre-tax profits to \u00a3233m. Perhaps even more impressively she managed to smooth over industrial relations with the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which had threatened days of strikes before Christmas. Royal Mail's 140,000 workers were given a 9% pay rise over three years.</p> <p>Now Greene will have to focus on securing the long-term future of Royal Mail. The company and the government said the service needed to be privatised to enable it to generate cash to invest in parcel delivery as letter use continues to decline. On average 58m letters are sent every day, compared with 63m in 2011-12.</p> <p>Battles are also expected over the universal service obligation that requires Royal Mail to deliver to every address in Britain six days a week for the same price. The USO is protected by law until 2021, but other countries, including Greene's native Canada, are ending door-to-door delivery. <strong>Rupert Neate</strong></p> <h2>Jamie Dimon </h2> <p><strong>Chief executive, JP Morgan </strong></p> <p><strong>Sector: Wall Street</strong></p> <p>Poor Jamie Dimon. Nothing went right for him in 2013. After an annus horribilis of billion dollar fines and public admissions of wrongdoing even the JP Morgan boss's Christmas card backfired. The foldout card of his photogenic family playing tennis inside their opulent home soon became fodder for late night comedians.</p> <p>Dimon steered his bank so ably through the financial crisis but has seemed impotent as his bank and his own reputation have been trashed. And there is more to come in 2014. US officials are investigating to what extent JP aided and abetted Bernard Madoff, the infamous swindler, and bought up the children of influential Chinese officials in order to further its own business.</p> <p>It's hard to imagine another industry where the leader of a major company could survive such a catalogue of disaster</p> <h2>Dermot Nolan </h2> <p><strong>Chief executive, Ofgem</strong></p> <p><strong>Sector: Energy</strong></p> <p>Dermot Nolan is moving into one of the hottest jobs in Britain as chief executive of the energy watchdog, Ofgem. It is his task to try to ensure that Britons do not freeze because the energy markets fail to work properly.</p> <p>His predecessor, Alistair Buchanan, failed and departed by the back door with a leaving note that said there was a high possibility that the lights would go out if nothing changed.</p> <p>Nolan is heading an organisation described by MPs as a toothless tiger which has become so discredited that the Labour party has promised to scrap it. But Nolan, who does not start until March, knows the terrain because he has spent three years working as chairman of Ireland's Commission for Energy Regulation.</p> <p>Critics will say the Yale University-trained economist has not been a great success, pointing to the fact that electricity prices in Ireland are the fourth highest in the European Union.</p> <p>Nolan will need to help customers tackle fuel poverty, stand up to the power of the big six energy companies and fend off desperate politicians trying to bolster their position before the 2015 general election.</p> <p>He will need the luck of the Irish to prosper. <strong>Terry Macalister</strong></p> <h2>Sir Martin Sorrell </h2> <p><strong>Chief executive, WPP</strong></p> <p><strong>Sector: Media</strong></p> <p>In a few months Sir Martin Sorrell will be unseated as the most powerful man in advertising, as rivals Publicis and Omnicom complete a $35bn (\u00a321.4bn) merger to create the world's largest marketing services group.</p> <p>The prospect has become something of an obsession for the chief executive of WPP, which has held the top spot since 2008, with 2014 set to be a clash of the advertising titans. \"The question strategically will be how he respond to the mega deal,\" says Alex DeGroote, media analyst at Panmure. \"It could leave WPP looking a bit sub-scale in some markets.\"</p> <p>The move deal-hungry bankers and investors would like to see is for WPP to buy IPG, the world's fifth-largest advertising group. That deal would allow WPP to hit back in the US, by some distance the world's largest advertising market, where Publicis Omnicom Group will have twice as much media buying muscle as Sorrell's business. <strong>Mark Sweney</strong></p> <h2>Mark Carney </h2> <p><strong>Governor, Bank of England</strong></p> <p><strong>Sector: Economy</strong></p> <p>Hand-picked by George Osborne to replace Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney holds the key to the performance of the economy in 2014. The Canadian had a dream start at Threadneedle Street: his arrival was marked by a surge in growth, a reshaping of monetary policy and a PR coup when he agreed to put Jane Austen's head on the next \u00a310 notes.</p> <p>Things get tougher next year. Carney's assumption when he announced the Bank's forward guidance in August was that it would take until early 2016 before unemployment reached the 7% threshhold that would automatically trigger a discussion about interest rates. But the rapid improvement in the labour market means joblessness could hit 7% by early 2014.</p> <p>Carney believes the economy is still too fragile to cope with higher interest rates and the Bank is concerned about the impact of dearer borrowing on debt-laden households. Yet, with the economy currently growing at more than 3% a year and the housing market humming, fears of overheating will grow. Carney says the Bank now has the powers to cool the housing market without the need for a rate rise that would affect the whole economy. He may need to use them. <strong>Larry Elliott</strong></p> <h2>Ross McEwan</h2> <p><strong>Chief executive, RBS </strong></p> <p><strong>Sector: Banking</strong></p> <p>Being boss of Royal Bank of Scotland was never going to be a low-profile role and Ross McEwan, who took over from Stephen Hester three months ago, will be in the industry spotlight throughout 2014.</p> <p>In January he will have to face the outcome of a review by Clifford Chance into allegations that the bailed-out bank has mistreated its small business customers. In February the New Zealander has promised to set out his strategy for the bank, which was rescued with \u00a345bn of taxpayers' money in 2008 and has yet to offer the public a profit on its 81% share stake.</p> <p>The City will want to see how much of a free hand McEwan has in devising his strategy. As it is, he is creating a new \u00a338bn non-core division as a result of a report commissioned by George Osborne, who has made clear his view that the bank should be domestically focused. McEwan, who has warned that RBS will make a substantial loss because of the creation of the bad bank, is expected to focus on the high street business. He seems likely to embark on a major overhaul of the IT systems which have at times left customers unable to access their cash and bank accounts. He also has to build a new management team. A finance director must be appointed after Nathan Bostock quit for Santander and the chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, has indicated that he is eyeing the exit. <strong>Jill Treanor</strong></p> <h2>Euan Sutherland </h2> <p><strong>Chief executive, Co-op Group</strong></p> <p><strong>Sector</strong>: <strong>Mutuals</strong></p> <p>Euan Sutherland ended 2013 with the relief of knowing that a \u00a31.5bn rescue package for Co-operative Bank had been pulled off. With the hole filled, the former boss of B&amp;Q must turn his attention to his new plan for the whole of the Co-op Group \u2013 which owns supermarkets, pharmacies, funeral homes and farms.</p> <p>Sutherland has pledged to set out a new vision for the UK's biggest mutual organisation by the time of the annual meeting in May. He will have to decide whether to sell any businesses to reduce the strain on the finances caused by the bank, which is only 30% owned by the mutual after its rescue. Cash to invest for growth in any of the business lines will be in short supply.</p> <p>The way the group is run will also be overhauled. Former City minister Lord Myners has become its first non-executive director and is viewed as a candidate to chair the group. At the same time the bank is facing a number of investigations: one into events at the bank by former civil servant Sir Christopher Kelly, which was commissioned by Sutherland, and another investigation by regulators that has been demanded by the government. <strong>Jill Treanor</strong></p> <h2>Angela Ahrendts </h2> <p><strong>Senior VP retail [designate], Apple</strong></p> <p><strong>Sector: Technology</strong></p> <p>Burberry's chief executive, Angela Ahrendts, will hang up her trenchcoat and head back to America next year to look after a very different kind of Macintosh \u2013 as Apple's retail boss. News of her departure wiped half a billion pounds from Burberry's stock market value, underlining the extent to which investors credit her with the UK firm's transformation into a global luxury brand.</p> <p>\"We met for the first time last January, and I knew in that meeting that I wanted her to join Apple,\" chief executive Tim Cook wrote in a letter announcing her arrival, in which he described Ahrendts as \"wicked smart\".</p> <p>She was the FTSE 100's best paid boss in 2012, with a package worth almost \u00a317m, and the US-born executive is expected to more than double her income with her first big job in technology. Ahrendts, who embraced technology and social media at Burberry, is the first executive to be trusted with overseeing both stores and the website at Apple, whose sales per square foot are already higher than any other retailer in the world. <strong>Juliette Garside</strong></p> <h2>Philip Clarke </h2> <p><strong>Chief executive, Tesco</strong></p> <p><strong>Sector: Retail</strong></p> <p>It's the UK's biggest supermarket, with some of retail's biggest problems. After a tough 2013, chief executive Phil Clarke has his work cut out to convince investors that he can revive Tesco's fortunes this year, with challenges at home and abroad.</p> <p>In Britain, Tesco has found itself caught between fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl and upmarket grocers such as Waitrose and M&amp;S, which are cashing in on concerns about the quality and provenance of food following the horsemeat scandal.</p> <p>Clarke desperately needs to carve out a firm identity for Tesco either by seriously taking on the discounters and Asda on price or by improving perceptions of the store's food quality and service in store.</p> <p>So far he is opting for the latter strategy in a \u00a31bn turnaround launched when Clarke took the reins in 2011. But progress seems slow. UK underlying sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, fell 1.5% in the three months to 23 November.</p> <p>With times still tough for shoppers whose disposable income is under pressure, Clarke is being pushed to do more on prices.</p> <p>The former international director will need to get a grip on problems overseas. Underlying sales are falling in all Tesco's major markets. Trading in Ireland, Thailand and South Korea \u2013 previously strong international markets for Tesco \u2013 are particularly poor. Shareholders were shocked by a 70% fall in trading profit in central Europe.</p> <p>There are a lot of fires to fight, and the pressure is on Clarke and his finance director, Laurie McIlwee, to show they have the answers this year. <strong>Sarah Butler</strong></p> <h2>Mary Barra </h2> <p><strong>Chief executive designate, GM</strong></p> <p><strong>Sector: Industry</strong></p> <p>A daughter of Motor City, Mary Barra takes the helm of Detroit and America's largest carmaker in January. Barra's appointment is significant enough as the first woman to run a major auto manufacturer, but it is also of importance to Britain and Europe, where GM is still trying to turn round its operations under the Vauxhall and Opel brands.</p> <p>Britain's high-end car producers, led by Jaguar Land Rover and Mini, are performing well but the volume market served by Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port and Luton plants is struggling. Ellesmere Port has won the competition to produce the next Astra, but expect Barra to take a prominent role in restructuring the European car industry next year and beyond. <strong>Dan Milmo </strong></p>",

NuGen is a joint venture between Spanish power company Iberdrola and French utility firm GDF Suez that is developing a plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, where the owners plan to build 3.6 gigawatts of nuclear capacity on a disused reactor site.</p> <p>Confirming that Toshiba will also buy part of GDF Suez's 50% stake when it acquires Iberdrola's 50% shareholding, Tanaka said: \"We want a majority to move forward. So we would want to take some of GDF's share, but have them remain as an operator.\" He added that securing a long-awaited majority holding in the NuGen consortium would guarantee a $14bn (\u00a38.5bn) deal for Toshiba's Westinghouse unit to supply three reactors for the project.</p> <p>Toshiba is keen to kickstart an ambitious reactor building programme that stalled after countries around the world \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/31/hinkley-point-german-greens-no-nuclear-policy\" title=\"\">led by Germany</a> \u2013 froze nuclear expansion plans and tightened regulations in the wake of Japan's 2011 disaster at Fukushima.</p> <p>Its domestic rival, Hitachi, has bought the Horizon project which intends to build two nuclear power stations, in Anglesey and Gloucestershire.</p> <p>Britain is one of the few countries pressing ahead with nuclear plans in spite of the safety fears raised by Fukushima. The government's determination to make nuclear a central part of its energy strategy was confirmed two months ago when ministers approved a deal with France's EDF Energy to build the \u00a316bn Hinkley Point nuclear power plant in Somerset. Analysts at Liberum Capital said state guarantees on electricity prices offered to EDF in order to secure the deal could prove to be \"economically insane\". The European Union has also weighed into the nuclear subsidy debate by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/18/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-subsidy-european-commission\" title=\"\">launching an investigation into whether the Hinkley deal broke state aid rules</a>.</p> <p>Iberdrola, which is selling assets to reduce debt, said this week that it has agreed to sell its 50% in NuGen to Toshiba for \u00a385m, subject to final approvals, terms and conditions.</p> <p>Tanaka said a majority stake was necessary to make progress on the project, where delays have frustrated the UK government, sources say, as it pushes through its own ambitious nuclear programme to replace new reactors. A controlling stake would allow Westinghouse, 87%-owned by Toshiba, to supply three of its AP1000 reactors for the site. After building the reactors, Toshiba would reduce its stake, Tanaka said.</p> <p>\"We are thinking about an exit, but we haven't decided anything yet,\" he said. \"We will reduce our majority stake over time. We are a plant provider, not a nuclear power provider.\"</p>",

So we would want to take some of GDF's share, but have them remain as an operator.\" He added that securing a long-awaited majority holding in the NuGen consortium would guarantee a $14bn (\u00a38.5bn) deal for Toshiba's Westinghouse unit to supply three reactors for the project. Toshiba is keen to kickstart an ambitious reactor building programme that stalled after countries around the world \u2013 led by Germany \u2013 froze nuclear expansion plans and tightened regulations in the wake of Japan's 2011 disaster at Fukushima. Its domestic rival, Hitachi, has bought the Horizon project which intends to build two nuclear power stations, in Anglesey and Gloucestershire. Britain is one of the few countries pressing ahead with nuclear plans in spite of the safety fears raised by Fukushima. The government's determination to make nuclear a central part of its energy strategy was confirmed two months ago when ministers approved a deal with France's EDF Energy to build the \u00a316bn Hinkley Point nuclear power plant in Somerset. Analysts at Liberum Capital said state guarantees on electricity prices offered to EDF in order to secure the deal could prove to be \"economically insane\". The European Union has also weighed into the nuclear subsidy debate by launching an investigation into whether the Hinkley deal broke state aid rules. Iberdrola, which is selling assets to reduce debt, said this week that it has agreed to sell its 50% in NuGen to Toshiba for \u00a385m, subject to final approvals, terms and conditions. Tanaka said a majority stake was necessary to make progress on the project, where delays have frustrated the UK government, sources say, as it pushes through its own ambitious nuclear programme to replace new reactors. A controlling stake would allow Westinghouse, 87%-owned by Toshiba, to supply three of its AP1000 reactors for the site. After building the reactors, Toshiba would reduce its stake, Tanaka said. \"We are thinking about an exit, but we haven't decided anything yet,\" he said. \"We will reduce our majority stake over time. We are a plant provider, not a nuclear power provider.\"",

      "bodyText": "Early-rising bargain hunters flocked to retailers across the UK on Thursday but high street visits tailed off by the afternoon as shops reported a 1.5% rise in Boxing Day shopping trips compared with last year. The increase in footfall will boost retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer which launched sales before 25 December as mild weather and a squeeze on disposable incomes hit clothing retailers in particular. In London it was standing room only on the buses ferrying shoppers to the West End for the Boxing Day sales. Queues formed outside Selfridges, Next, House of Fraser, M&amp;S and Debenhams, and by mid-morning footfall on Oxford Street had increased by double digits compared with last year, with 1.4 million shoppers expected to spend \u00a350m on deeply discounted bargains in the capital's central shopping area. \"Whilst there were heavy promotions across pre-Christmas, retailers are going that extra mile today with additional deals and refreshed merchandise to entice bargain hunters,\" said Sally Eden of the New West End Company, which published the footfall estimates. According to retail data company Springboard, there was a tentative bounce-back across the UK from last year, with visits to out-of-town sites driving the increase in footfall and 12% more visitors to retail parks than last year. Shopping centres were up 11% but high streets continued to suffer, with a 7% drop, and total footfall across all outlets rose 1.5%. The Bluewater shopping centre in Kent reported a 4,000-strong queue by the time its doors opened at 6am, while retail parks in Wales experienced the largest yearly uptick with 18% more visitors than last year by 10am. At Cabot Circus in Bristol, shoppers began queuing at 6am for the chance to grab a bargain, while at St David's shopping centre in Cardiff, retailers were expecting 150,000 visitors, with sales tipped to reach \u00a32m. Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield was expecting its busiest Boxing Day ever, after shoppers queued from 2am. In central London, tourists from China, Russia and the United Arab Emirates swelled the lines of shoppers penned in by security guards and crowd barriers outside Selfridges, where the first bargain hunters began queuing at 11.30pm on Christmas Day. With discounts of up to 75%, the department store took nearly \u00a32m in the first hour of trading across its four stores and website. Shoppers raced to the tills clutching designer items, with a Stella McCartney handbag and a half-price \u00a3322 clutch from Yves Saint Laurent among the first thee items sold. Chinese tourists, out in force alongside domestic shoppers, are forecast to spend \u00a31,367 per transaction, while Qataris will splash out over \u00a31,700 on each visit to the tills, according to tax-free shopping adviser Global Blue. But for British shoppers, with consumer prices rising faster than wages, economist Howard Archer at IHS warned the initial enthusiasm could quickly fade. \"Given still squeezed purchasing power, many people will be likely to be reluctant to buy items that they don't really want or need in the sales. If this is the case, interest could fall away pretty quickly once the best of the bargains have gone. This would put pressure on retailers to cut prices even more, thereby further hurting their margins.\" Pensioner Stanley Ozin stayed indoors during the storms earlier in the week, but ventured out on Boxing Day with his wife, Mon,a to stock up on kitchenware and make the most of a free breakfast and 15% discount offered by Debenhams, which is advertising its biggest ever half-price sale. \"There's very good bargains on offer, although we aren't spending more this year than last year,\" he said. \"We just came to see what is around and how big the discounts are,\" said IT manager Corn\u00e9 Labuschagne. By 11am he had already picked up a coat, a suit and a pair of shoes from Debenhams. \"There were lots of discounts before Christmas but I held out until Boxing Day to see how low it could go.\" Montana Buckley was in the West End looking for a birthday present with her boyfriend, Thomas Calladine, from Romford in Essex. The couple made most of their Christmas purchases at the Bicester Village retail park in Oxfordshire. \"I'm spending more this year,\" said Calladine, \"but only because they are doing better sales. It used to be you could only buy one thing. Now you spend the extra \u00a330 and you get five or six things in the sale.\" Londoner Gary Heavy had not intended to join the Boxing Day rush but gave in to temptation with an impulse buy of lingerie for his girlfriend from Ann Summers. He said: \"I'm spending more than last year, partly because there's more people in my family now. My most expensive present was a \u00a3280 pair of Ugg boots for my mother.\" While the John Lewis flagship store on Oxford street was among the only shops not open for business \u2013 its partners take two days' rest at Christmas \u2013 takings from its online clearance sale showed a marked increase with a 19% rise on Christmas Day. Sony Bravia flat-screen televisions and Bosch washing machines were among the top sellers, with three-quarters of traffic coming from mobile phones and tablets rather than desktop computers. \"The tipping point has now been passed and we expect mobile to be the way the majority of people shop online from now on,\" said online director Mark Lewis.",

      "bodyText": "A rising population, a low-tax regime and insulation from the worst of the eurozone's problems leave Britain on course to overtake Germany as Europe's biggest economy within the next two decades, according to a study released on Thursday. The annual world economic league tables from the Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR) predicts that Germany \u2013 for decades Europe's powerhouse economy \u2013 will have a smaller economy than the UK by about 2030. Although strong growth by emerging economies such as India, Brazil and Russia mean that the UK will slip down the global rankings over the next two decades, the CEBR said it would be the second most successful western economy after the US. \"Positive demographics with continuing immigration [and] rather less exposure to the problems of the eurozone than other European economies combine with relatively low taxes by European standards to encourage faster growth than in most western economies,\" the report said. \"Issues for the UK include the need to further reorient its exports to the faster growing markets, an unresolved relationship with the rest of the EU and the possibility of breakup \u2013 highlighted by the referendum on Scottish independence in September 2014.\" The CEBR said it used forecasts for growth, inflation and currency values to compile league tables of the size of economies measured in US dollars in 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028. It said the predictions needed to be treated with caution, especially in light of the unpredictable fluctuations in currencies. But the CEBR said its model showed China overtaking the US to become the world's biggest economy by 2028, by which time both will be five times as big as India, in third place. For some years, economists have been trying to assess when China will overtake the US. The CEBR said it would take longer than some analysts have suggested due to the continuing performance of the US as the west's strongest economy and the slowing down of the Chinese economy. India is expected to overtake Japan as the world's third biggest economy within 15 years, with Brazil fifth and Germany only just ahead of the UK in sixth by 2028. The CEBR said \"Abenomics\" \u2013 the anti-deflation strategy named after Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe \u2013 would lead to a weak yen for the foreseeable future which would affect the dollar value of its national output. The CEBR said: \"Theoretically Germany should continue to perform well in future years. However, on the assumption that the euro does not break up, a combination of weak European economic growth, a depreciating currency, the requirement to bail out ailing economies in the rest of the eurozone and increasingly adverse population trends mean that in this forecast Germany eventually slips down the league table. \"Indeed, Germany is forecast to lose its position as the largest western European economy to the UK around 2030 because of the UK's faster population growth and lesser dependence on the other European economies.\" The study found that a break-up of the euro would improve the outlook for Germany, since it would have a \"harder\" currency and therefore higher GDP in dollar terms. \"A deutschemark-based Germany certainly would not be overtaken by the UK for many years, if ever.\" Other eurozone countries will suffer even sharper falls down the league table, the CEBR said. France, currently fifth, will drop to 13th by 2028, while Italy, eighth, will be the world's 15th biggest economy in 15 years' time. The UK, currently sixth in the world league table, will move up a place by 2018, overtaking France. But by 2023 it will have dropped to seventh, having been displaced by India and Brazil.",

      "bodyText": "New \"challenger\" banks will find it easier to check the credit-worthiness of potential business customers under new proposals published by the government , which it hopes will lead to an increase in lending to businesses in deprived areas. The government is consulting on new rules for sharing small and medium enterprise (SME) credit data, with the aim of making it easier for challenger banks and alternative finance providers to enter the market and provide credit. Banks will be required to share SME credit data through credit reference agencies. At the moment, the big-four high-street banks control 85% of SME lending. Improved access to credit data through greater competition and innovation in SME lending should improve the cost and quality of services offered. The move comes as \u2013 after pressure from the Co-operative party \u2013 a Labour policy review looks at proposals to force banks to publish their lending data down to postcode level and to expand community finance. Labour has been looking at the US example of banking disclosure and community lending requirements under its community reinvestment act and the home mortgage disclosure act. These laws, expanded under Barack Obama to include business lending, force American banks to disclose what, where and how they lend and force the bigger banks to lend in areas of deprivation and poverty using community banks or credit unions if they wouldn't do it themselves. Examples of community banks, or Community Development Finance Institutions, as they are officially known in the UK, include Five Lamps, which provides personal and business loans as well as training and advice in north-east England, and the Black Country Reinvestment Society, which provides access to finance for social enterprises and SMEs in the West Midlands. The government has agreed a voluntary deal with some of the banks to publish some information on their lending. From January 2014, the UK's seven biggest lenders will make quarterly releases showing the outstanding stock of lending committed to customers across loans and overdrafts to SMEs, mortgages and unsecured personal loans. The British Bankers' Association will release aggregated data for the seven participants. A number of bodies, including the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, have all highlighted a lack of information about the creditworthiness of SMEs, as well as details about where banks are willing to lend. Treasury financial secretary Sajid Javid said: \"The government is determined to build a banking system that supports Britain's economy and its small and medium sized businesses. \"The best way to deliver this is to increase competition in the sector and remove the barriers to new sources of finance for SMEs.

      "body": "<p>New \"challenger\" banks will find it easier to check the credit-worthiness of potential business customers under new proposals published by the government , which it hopes will lead to an increase in lending to businesses in deprived areas.</p> <p>The government is consulting on new rules for sharing small and medium enterprise (SME) credit data, with the aim of making it easier for challenger banks and alternative finance providers to enter the market and provide credit. Banks will be required to share SME credit data through credit reference agencies.</p> <p>At the moment, the big-four high-street banks control 85% of SME lending. Improved access to credit data through greater competition and innovation in SME lending should improve the cost and quality of services offered.</p> <p>The move comes as \u2013 after pressure from the Co-operative party \u2013 a Labour policy review looks at proposals to force banks to publish their lending data down to postcode level and to expand community finance.</p> <p>Labour has been looking at the US example of banking disclosure and community lending requirements under its community reinvestment act and the home mortgage disclosure act. These laws, expanded under Barack Obama to include business lending, force American banks to disclose what, where and how they lend and force the bigger banks to lend in areas of deprivation and poverty using community banks or credit unions if they wouldn't do it themselves.</p> <p>Examples of community banks, or Community Development Finance Institutions, as they are officially known in the UK, include Five Lamps, which provides personal and business loans as well as training and advice in north-east England, and the Black Country Reinvestment Society, which provides access to finance for social enterprises and SMEs in the West Midlands.</p> <p>The government has agreed a voluntary deal with some of the banks to publish some information on their lending. From January 2014, the UK's seven biggest lenders will make quarterly releases showing the outstanding stock of lending committed to customers across loans and overdrafts to SMEs, mortgages and unsecured personal loans. The British Bankers' Association will release aggregated data for the seven participants.</p> <p>A number of bodies, including the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, have all highlighted a lack of information about the creditworthiness of SMEs, as well as details about where banks are willing to lend.</p> <p>Treasury financial secretary Sajid Javid said: \"The government is determined to build a banking system that supports Britain's economy and its small and medium sized businesses.</p> <p>\"The best way to deliver this is to increase competition in the sector and remove the barriers to new sources of finance for SMEs. Requiring banks to share data is an important part of creating a more level playing field that will enable more providers to enter the market.\"</p> <p>The government said it intended to bring forward legislation on SMEs in the next session of parliament.</p>",
