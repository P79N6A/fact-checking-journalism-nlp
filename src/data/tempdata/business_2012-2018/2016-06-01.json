      "bodyText": "A top City banker, who is a close confidante of Sir Philip Green, advised the convicted fraudster who tried to buy BHS during 2013 and 2014, documents seen by the Guardian reveal. Robin Saunders, a banker once known as \u201cthe queen of the City\u201d, helped Green raise funds to buy the chain in 2000. She was part of the team conducting due diligence on the retailer being led by Paul Sutton, a 59-year-old bankrupt businessman who was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment after being found guilty in absentia of embezzlement in France in 2002. Saunders, who made her name at the German bank West LB in the early 2000s and had stints as an adviser for Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s Formula One business and the refinancing of Wembley stadium, is credited with pushing through the deal that enabled Green\u2019s breakthrough acquisition of BHS 16 years ago. She went on to sit on the BHS board and received handsome dividends from the company, before it merged with Green\u2019s Arcadia group in 2009. It is not clear how she came to work for Sutton. During the parliamentary hearings on the BHS collapse last week, Paul Budge, the finance director of Green\u2019s Arcadia group, said he met Sutton in April 2013 after being \u201cput in touch with us via a banker friend of Sir Philip\u2019s\u201d. Budge added: \u201c[Sutton] wanted to invest in BHS at that time. We talked on and off for many months without really going anywhere. He worked up a business plan \u2013 it was called Project Albion \u2013 and the idea was to turn BHS around to profitability.\u201d Documents, seen by the Guardian and sent to both Sutton and Saunders, refer to a \u201cpossible sale and purchase of, or investment in, our BHS business\u201d, which was being run under the a codename of Albion during 2013. Saunders did not respond to phone calls and emails. Green declined to comment. The news that such a well-known ally of Green\u2019s was involved with a BHS bidder comes after it emerged that funding from Guy Dellal and Alexander Dellal \u2013 the son and grandson of property investor \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal who helped to finance Green\u2019s takeover of retail group Sears in 1998 \u2013 helped push through Green\u2019s sale of BHS to Dominic Chappell last year. The Dellals provided \u00a335m to Chappell \u2013 whose consortium bought BHS in 2015 \u2013 which he needed to show he was a credible acquirer of the store chain. The Dellals\u2019 company, Allied Commercial Exporters, then went on to make millions from a series of real-estate deals with the department store chain. BHS collapsed into administration barely a year after Chappell acquired it, leaving 11,000 jobs at risk and the company pension fund in deficit to the tune of \u00a3571m. After acquiring the business, more than \u00a325m was paid out from BHS to Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, in the period between its sale and it falling into administration. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. Chappell, who is due to answer questions on the store\u2019s collapse in front of a parliamentary select committee next week, was briefly a director of a company understood to be controlled by Sutton, while both men attended meetings together about acquiring BHS during 2014. Sutton was eventually ousted from the transaction when a dossier outlining his controversial history was sent to Green. Chappell then pressed ahead with his own deal, while Green demanded guarantees that Sutton was not involved in the transaction.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Downbeat manufacturing data from around the globe, warnings from the OECD about the outlook and the repercussions of Brexit, and continuing concerns about a US rate rise have combined to get the new month off to an uninspiring start for investors. European markets have closed lower across the board but have come off their worst levels after a slight recovery in the oil price on hopes of an output agreement at Thursday\u2019s Opec meeting. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 38.86 points or 0.62% at 6191.93 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.57% to 10,204.44 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.67% lower at 4475.39 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.19% to 17,810.85 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.3% at 8916.9 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.29% to 645.10 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered much of its earlier fall and is currently down just 16 points or 0.09%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest European Central Bank meeting. After the individual PMIs, the global index shows manufacturing stagnating: David Hensley at JP Morgan, which compiled the global index along with Marki, said: The May PMI data suggest that the global manufacturing sector remains in a low gear. Indices for output, new orders and the headline PMI were all at, or barely above, the stagnation mark. The move up in the finished goods inventory index suggests manufacturers are still working to realign stocks with demand. Of course, there are always conflicting reports ahead of any meeting of oil producers: Oil prices have recovered from earlier losses following a Reuters report that Opec ministers meeting in Vienna on Thursday are likely to consider a new ceiling on output. After falling as low as $48.65 a barrel, Brent crude is now up 0.12% at $49.95. But: But the ISM manufactuing numbers are not essential for the Federal Reserve in its interest rate deliberations, said James Smith at ING Bank: The ISM Manufacturing index surprised on the upside, ticking up from 50.8 to 51.3, rather than down to 50.3 as had been expected following a raft of weak regional surveys. Looking beneath the headline though, the headline was lifted solely by a large pick-up in the supplier deliveries index. Aside from that, most other components remained roughly where they were last time around... Overall though, the index remains only tentatively within growth territory (ie above 50), but crucially, this is a much better position than where it was around the turn of the year. For the Federal Open Market Committee though, the ISM numbers are not essential in timing the next rate hike. Attention is now heavily centred on Friday\u2019s labour report. In advance of this, some emphasis is likely to be put on the employment components of this, and to a greater extent the non-manufacturing ISM, although we\u2019d note that neither are tightly correlated with non-farm payrolls. In any case, the employment component of the manufacturing ISM remained flat this time around. We think that the risk of an above consensus non-farm payrolls (NFP) reading (currently at 160,000) is higher than a sub-consensus one. Although we tend to agree that job creation may be slowing as the economy reaches a point close to full employment, we feel that the month-on-month volatility in the headline NFP means that something at or above what we consider to be the underlying trend (around 185,000) is reasonably likely. Never-the-less, we feel that this element of the labour report is not critical to the FOMC\u2019s thinking at present. The Fed\u2019s labour market \u201ctick-box\u201d has effectively already been ticked (and arguably has for several months) and the key now lies with the activity data, which has improved slightly after a weak first quarter. Thus, we feel that the answer to the June/July/September debate now lies with chair Yellen (who speaks next week) and we currently think that July is the most likely timing for the next hike. Both sets of US manufacturing figures may have come in better than expected but still show signs of weakness, said Connor Campbell at Spreadex: Both the Markit and ISM PMIs surpassed expectations (at 50.7 and 51.3 respectively), though the performance from the former still points to a slowdown month-on-month while the latter is hardly a world-beating number, being lower than the Eurozone\u2019s own stagnant growth. It is hard to tell whether the Dow\u2019s negative start to the session stemmed from a) the general malaise that engulfed Europe this morning, b) the better than forecast PMIs giving a bit of extra heft to the Fed hawks or c) the fact that the manufacturing figures are still worryingly weak. Regardless the Dow Jones plunged 90 points after the open before settling at a 60-ish point loss, leaving the index at its lowest price in around a week. And there\u2019s more for the US Federal Reserve to consider ahead of this month\u2019s meeting, when a rate rise has still not been ruled out. US construction spending fell 1.8% in April, the largest monthly decline since January 2011. March\u2019s figure was revised up from a 0.5% rise to a 1.5% increase. Analysts had been expecting the April figure to show a rise of 0.6%. This piece of negative data in what has been a mixed batch of reports recently could see economists cutting their second quarter GDP forecasts. However there is a more positive sign from the ISM manufacturing survey. The manufacturing activity index came in at 51.3 in May, well ahead of expectations of a figure of 51.3, and ahead of April\u2019s 50.8. But the new orders index dipped from 55.8 in April to 55.7, while the employment index was flat at 49.2 after expectations of a rise to 49.7. The manufacturing PMI provides another sign of a slowing US economy, says Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. He said: The survey data indicate that factory output fell in May at its fastest rate since 2009, suggesting that manufacturing is acting as a severe drag on the economy in the second quarter. Payroll numbers are under pressure as factories worry about slower order book growth, in part linked to falling export demand but also as a result of growing uncertainty surrounding the presidential election. For those looking for a rebound in the economy after the lacklustre start to the year, the deteriorating trend in manufacturing is not going to provide any comfort. US manufacturing growth slowed slightly in May from the previous month, according to the latest Markit index. The final manufacturing PMI came in at 50.7, better than the preliminary estimate of 50.5, but down on the 50.8 recorded in April. Markit said this was the lowest level since September 2009. As forecast, US markets have started the trading day in negative territory. Falling oil prices and weak Chinese and European manufacturing data have combined to unsettle investors, who are already nervous at the prospect of another US interest rate rise. There is also caution ahead of Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, and the US non-farm payroll numbers a day later. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 120 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdq both opened around 0.4% lower. The FTSE 100 has fallen 1.1% or 69 points, while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.8% and France\u2019s Cac nearly 1%. More US data is due shortly, with the Markit manufacturing PMI followed by the ISM manufacturing survey. Wall Street is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead, and selloff when trading begins shortly. Over in Greece it\u2019s been an eventful day in parliament where MPs have voted overwhelmingly to rescind a law that would have allowed them to have holdings in offshore companies. In a roll call vote deputies dropped a law that many - ironically - had failed to see when endorsing a 7,500-page multi-bill of creditor-mandated reforms ten days ago. The clause, revealed by a Sunday\u2019s proto Thema newspaper, had caused prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist led coalition extraordinary embarrassment. Tsipras was voted into power saying his Syriza party would abolish measures deemed to promote tax evasion. In a double whammy for the government, uproar over the clause has coincided with a tsunami of indirect taxes on luxury goods that comes into force today. Brazilians have woken up to the news that they face an even deeper recession than expected. In today\u2019s economic outlook, the OECD has predicted that Brazil\u2019s GDP will shrink by 4.3% in 2016, as joblessness spikes. Back in February the OECD expected a 4.0% contraction this year, before the recent impeachment of Dilma Roussef gripped the country. The OECD says: \u201cThe deep recession is set to continue in 2016 and in 2017 against the backdrop of high political uncertainty and ongoing corruption revelations that are undermining consumer and business confidence, leading to a continuous contraction in domestic demand. \u201cAs the economy shrinks, unemployment is set to rise further.\u201d With inflation also worryingly high, and its Petrobras oil giant mired in its money-laundering scandal, the outlook for Brazil does looks very challenging. Attendees at the OECD\u2019s Forum in Paris haven\u2019t lost their enthusiasm for free trade: In other news....the London Stock Exchange Group has just revealed that more than a thousands jobs could be lost through its merger with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse. In a prospectus to investors, the LSEG explains that 1,250 positions will be eliminated across the combined group once the \u20ac20bn deal is approved (assuming nothing derails it). Most of the jobs will lost through \u201ctechnology enabled efficiencies\u201d, or by restructuring various back-office and HQ operations. However, it is sugaring the pill by predicting that 200 new roles could be created as a result of \u201cproposed growth initiatives\u201d. Here are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 today: Building supply chain Wolseley is leading the selloff after it reported slowing revenue growth in the UK and Europe -- another sign that the world economy is weakening. And housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Development are out of favour, after Nationwide building society reported that house price growth has slowed. European stock markets are heading deeper into the red, as the OECD\u2019s Brexit warning continue to haunt investors. The FTSE 100 is now down 67 points, of over 1%, at 6163. Banks and mining stocks are among the fallers, reflecting worries about global economic growth. The weak factory figures from China overnight also hurting confidence, as is the news that eurozone factory growth has hit a three-month low. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, explains: \u201cEquities are nursing losses this morning as yesterday\u2019s breakdowns from comfortable consolidation/uptrends yesterday gather pace. This comes after a revival of geopolitical risk (Brexit poll) and a raft of mixed data from across the globe (run of poor US manufacturing; China and Eurozone PMIs failing to inspire; UK Consumers delaying borrowing). Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s news story about the OECD\u2019s latest warning about Brexit, and its new economic forecasts. Brexit uncertainty has also hurt some UK factories, according to a new survey. One in three manufacturers polled by Markit said June\u2019s referendum has had a detrimental, or very detrimental, effect on their business, while half reported no impact. There\u2019s a silver lining, though, almost one percent said Brexit uncertainty had been strongly beneficial. Maybe they manufacture campaign posters, or possibly ear plugs.... Markit also found that Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector basically stagnated last month. It\u2019s UK factory PMI came in at 50.1, just over the \u2018break-even\u2019 point between expansion and contraction. The prime minister has also tweeted about the OECD\u2019s report: Cameron D. failed to mention that the economy has already suffered from Brexit fears, according to the OECD (see earlier entry) The opposition Labour party have swiftly seized on the news that the OECD has slashed its UK growth forecasts, from 2.1% to 1.7% this year. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says: \u201cToday\u2019s OECD report once again shows the absolute failure of the Chancellor\u2019s economic policy. Not only has productivity slumped, but the OECD also highlight the risk of further bubbles in the housing market whilst housebuilding continues at too low a level. Further proof that George Osborne\u2019s recovery is built on sand. \u201cWith the OECD forecasting a dramatic shock to the whole economy from a Tory Brexit, it\u2019s clear we can\u2019t risk failed Tory economic policy any more. We need a serious commitment from this government to invest in infrastructure and housing, backed up by a real industrial strategy to place the economy on a sound foundation and build the high-tech, high-wage economy of the future.\u201d If the OECD are right, then George Osborne could struggle to hit its economic targets. Back in March, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicted the UK would grow by 2% this year. Lower growth will probably translate to weaker tax receipts, making it harder to cut the deficit. Pro-Brexit campaigners often argue that it\u2019s impossible to say exactly how the UK economy would perform outside of the EU. After all, the government can\u2019t get its annual forecasts right, so how can we accurately project growth over a longer horizon? The OECD acknowledges this, with three different scenarios for Brexit. However, they all show that the economy would suffer: The pound has just weakened to a two-week low against the US dollar, at $1.4439, after another opinion poll hit the wires: You can see the full report from the OECD here. Amid the flurry of figures from the OECD, this one stands out. After Brexit, UK GDP would be 3% lower by 2020, while the European Union\u2019s economy would be 1% smaller, according to the Paris-based thinktank. The Financial Times have created a handy graph to show the likely impact if the Leave side are victorious on June 23. The OECD is adamant that this month\u2019s EU referendum has already hurt the British economy. In its report on the UK (online here), it says: Growth has slowed, and is projected to be 1\u00be per cent in 2016. Uncertainty about the outcome of the end-June 2016 referendum, which could lead to an exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit), has undermined growth. This projection assumes that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union, in which case growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2016 and then stabilise in 2017..... However: The outcome of the referendum is a major risk for the economy. A vote for Brexit would heighten uncertainty, raise the cost of finance and hamper investment. The OECD also points out the Britain\u2019s trade deficit is running at record highs: It adds that productivity has been \u201cexceptionally weak since 2007, and reviving it is essential to sustain growth and living standards.\u201d More here: Another chart showing how the OECD fears the impact of Britain leaving the EU: This chart highlights how pessimistic the OECD is about growth in advanced economies: Brexit fears are also driving up the cost of insuring against a plunge in the value of the pound. Sterling volatility has jumped to the highest level in more than seven years after a Guardian poll showed the Brexit camp is in the lead ahead of this month\u2019s EU referendum. One-month implied sterling volatility - the price of insuring against swings in the pound against the dollar - rose to 19.6% from 17% a day earlier, as Brexit fears mounted. It was the highest level since the depths of the financial crisis February 2009, a month before the Bank of England made the unprecedented moved of cutting interest rates to an all-time low of 0.5%. Sterling volatility is considered a sign of market anxiety, and Wednesday\u2019s surge followed a Guardian poll that showed voters are 52%-48% split in favour of leaving the European Union. Will Straw, executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, says voters should take the OECD\u2019s Brexit warning seriously: The OECD is presenting its new Economic Outlook report in Paris right now: The youngest and oldest in society will suffer most if the world economy does not pick up pace, fears the OECD. Catherine Mann explains that governments will find it harder and harder to meet \u201cfundamental promises\u201d, such as jobs opportunity and pensions. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take action to boost productivity and potential growth, both younger and older generations will be worse off. The consequences of policy inaction will be low career prospects for today\u2019s youth, who have suffered so much already from the crisis, and lower retirement income for future pensioners.\u201d The OECD is urging governments across the globe to boost their spending, to spur growth. Their chief economist Catherine Mann says there is an \u201curgent\u201d need to use fiscal firepower to boost demand. She warns: \u201cThe longer the global economy remains in the low-growth trap, the more difficult it will be to break the negative feedback loops.\u201d In a gloomy update, the OECD has also lowered its growth forecast for the 34 countries who make up its \u2018club\u2019 to 1.8% this year and 2.1% in 2017. That\u2019s down from 2.2% and 2.3% six months ago. It has cut its US growth forecast to 1.8% this year, instead of the 2% it forecast in February. It also forecasts another year of recession in Russia. However, it has raised its forecast for eurozone growth this year to 1.6%, from 1.4%. Breaking: The OECD has slashed its forecast for UK growth this year to just 1.7%. That\u2019s down from an estimate of 2.1% three months ago, and much weaker than the 2.3% growth recorded in 2015. And the Paris-based body is also warning that Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union would have a serious impact on the global economy. Indeed, it claims that Brexit is as big a threat to the global economy as a hard landing in China. From Paris, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: Catherine Mann, chief economist at the OECD said the uncertainty caused by the referendum came at a time when the global economy was caught in a low-growth trap. \u201cSpillovers could be significant to other countries\u201d, Mann said as she predicted that the world economy would grow by 3% in 2016 and by 3.3% in 2017 - forecasts that have remained unchanged since its last health check three months ago. \u201cWe have done a lot of work on what a hard landing in China would mean. It is in the same ball park as Brexit.\u201d More to follow.... Breaking: Growth across Europe\u2019s manufacturing base has slowed to its slowest rate since February, leaving factories in near-stagnation. The eurozone factory PMI, produced by data firm Markit, has dropped to 51.5 for May, down from 51.7 in April, closer to the 50-point mark that shows no growth at all. Markit reports that the French and Greek factory sectors shrank last month, while growth slowed in Spain, Italy and Ireland. Worryingly, firms across the eurozone reported that new order growth slowed last month, forcing them to slash prices (again) to stimulate demand. New export order growth hit a 16-month low, and job creation slowed too. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears that the eurozone recovery is faltering: \u201cManufacturing in the euro area remained stuck in a state of near-stagnation in May, failing to break out of the slow growth phase that has plagued producers since February. \u201cThe disappointing performance of manufacturing adds to suspicions that the pace of eurozone economic growth in the second quarter has cooled after a surprisingly brisk start to the year based on the latest estimate of GDP. \u201cNew orders grew at the slowest rate for over a year as demand showed signs of waning both within the euro area and further afield. Not surprisingly, companies remain reluctant to build capacity and take on extra workers, lacking signs of any imminent upturn in demand. Switzerland\u2019s economy has grown much less strongly than expected, reinforcing the OECD\u2019s concerns about growth. The Swiss economy grew 0.1 per cent in the first three months of 2016, missing expectations of 0.3% expansion. Switzerland\u2019s financial services and hotel and catering industry contracted, while the manufacturing, construction and the healthcare sectors grew. New factory data from Ireland suggest that its economy may have been hit as Brexit uncertainty drifts over the Irish Sea. The Irish manufacturing PMI fell to 51.5 in May from 52.6 in April. That\u2019s the weakest reading in 27 months, suggesting that factory growth slowed last month. Irish firms reported that new export orders fell, while output and new business grew at a slower rate. Investec, which compiles the PMI, argues that Britain\u2019s upcoming EU referendum is partly to blame. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland, says: We expect that at least some of the weakness relates to that event [the EU vote] and other international uncertainties. With momentum appearing to be building behind the \u2018Remain\u2019 campaign, sterling has recently begun to strengthen against the single currency, which augurs well for the near-term outlook for many Irish exporters. However, a poll published by the Guardian on Tuesday showed a pick-up in support for the Leave campaign, which sent the pound sliding against the euro. That makes it harder for eurozone manufacturers to sell goods into the UK market, which is the destination for roughly one-seventh of Irish merchandise exports. Angel Gurria\u2019s fears over the global economy may have hurt sentiment in the City. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has fallen by 40 points, or 0.6%, to a one-week low of 6,195 points. The other main European indices are also in the red. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains why investors are jittery this month: China set the tone this Wednesday, the country\u2019s continually limp manufacturing PMIs (the government-released figure remained at 50.1 while the Caixin reading slumped to a 3 month low of 49.2) an unwanted reminder of the global weaknesses circling the market like vultures. Along that theme the OECD also chimed in with a worldwide warning this morning, Angel Gurria stating that \u2018conditions are very difficult\u2019 due to sluggish global growth. So not exactly the best backdrop to begin the month against, especially with June\u2019s investor-concerning Fed meeting and UK EU referendum rapidly approaching. Angel Gurr\u00eda adds that the OECD is also concerned that Britain could vote to leave the EU in this month\u2019s referendum. It is a threat to the global economy, he tells Bloomberg TV, but particularly to the people of the UK. The OECD has calculated that Brexit is effectively a tax, of between \u00a32,000 and \u00a35,000 per year. A month\u2019s pay, for which you get nothing in return, he argues. Angel Gurr\u00eda also warns that more must be done to fight inequality, calling it the defining issue of our time. The global economy is struggling, due to weak trade and problems in emerging markets. That\u2019s according to the head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Angel Gurr\u00eda, Secretary-General of the OECD, gave the warning hours before the OECD is due to release its new economic outlook. He told Bloomberg TV that global economic conditions are very difficult. And that means that the world economy faces \u201ca rather mediocre, a rather dismal outlook.\u201d Gurr\u00eda pinned the blame on problems with the engines of growth, which are dangerously misfiring. He explained: Trade is growing at 2% to 3%, it should be growing at 7%. Only five times in the last 50 years has trade been growing below the rate of growth of the GDP of the world. On those 5 occasions, there been a very serious deceleration, even a recession. I\u201dm not saying there will be a recession this time. I\u2019m just saying conditions are very difficult. Gurr\u00eda says that the world economy is only expected to grow by 3% in 2016 - matching 2015\u2019s less-than-stellar performance. He also predicted that there will only be a small improvement in 2017. Three months ago, the OECD expected 3.3% growth in 2017; so Gurr\u00eda may be hinting at a fresh downgrade today. The OECD issues its new forecasts at 9.30am UK time (10.30am in Paris). Our economics editor Larry Elliott is in Paris for the OECD forum, so we\u2019ll have more details through the day.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new month, which means we get a new healthcheck on the world\u2019s factory sectors. PMIs reports from Asia, Europe and America will show whether manufacturing output rose or fell in May, and thus highlight whether fears of an economic slowdown are justified. We\u2019ve already heard from China. The official Chinese May manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) has come in at 50.1, only fractionally above stagnation. That suggests its factory sector is stabilising, but not delivering much growth. We\u2019ll hear from eurozone countries, including German and France, between 8am and 9am BST. Other highlights include the UK at 9.30am, followed by the US at 3pm. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that French factories struggled in May. In Europe, while France has continued to underachieve in its manufacturing sector, with the recent fuel blockades unlikely to help matters in the coming weeks, a reading of 48.3 is expected here, we have seen the latest German, Spain and Italian numbers hold above the 50 levels quite comfortably, though they have been slowing on a month on month basis. Spain and Italy are expected to show readings of 52.6, 53.5, both down on April, while German activity has started to improve with a reading of 52.5 expected, up from 51.8. Also coming up today... The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is holding a forum in Paris. Economists will also be digesting new growth figures from Australia, which beat expectations: And in the City, cars-to-bikes group Halfords and building supplies group Wolseley are reporting financial results, while building society Nationwide is publishing monthly house price data. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events though the day....",

Overall though, the index remains only tentatively within growth territory (ie above 50), but crucially, this is a much better position than where it was around the turn of the year.</p> <p>For the Federal Open Market Committee though, the ISM numbers are not essential in timing the next rate hike. Attention is now heavily centred on Friday\u2019s labour report. In advance of this, some emphasis is likely to be put on the employment components of this, and to a greater extent the non-manufacturing ISM, although we\u2019d note that neither are tightly correlated with non-farm payrolls. In any case, the employment component of the manufacturing ISM remained flat this time around.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"801e355c676e667c5f3d90323a93db6ebaf6bbb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/801e355c676e667c5f3d90323a93db6ebaf6bbb4/0_0_488_461/488.jpg\" alt=\"US jobs comparisons\" width=\"488\" height=\"461\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US jobs comparisons</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Macrobond, ING</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>We think that the risk of an above consensus non-farm payrolls (NFP) reading (currently at 160,000) is higher than a sub-consensus one. Although we tend to agree that job creation may be slowing as the economy reaches a point close to full employment, we feel that the month-on-month volatility in the headline NFP means that something at or above what we consider to be the underlying trend (around 185,000) is reasonably likely. Never-the-less, we feel that this element of the labour report is not critical to the FOMC\u2019s thinking at present. The Fed\u2019s labour market \u201ctick-box\u201d has effectively already been ticked (and arguably has for several months) and the key now lies with the activity data, which has improved slightly after a weak first quarter. Thus, we feel that the answer to the June/July/September debate now lies with chair Yellen (who speaks next week) and we currently think that July is the most likely timing for the next hike. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-574ef0bfe4b0467e825fbac1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-01T14:29:19.365Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Both sets of US manufacturing figures may have come in better than expected but still show signs of weakness, said Connor Campbell at Spreadex:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Both the Markit and ISM PMIs surpassed expectations (at 50.7 and 51.3 respectively), though the performance from the former still points to a slowdown month-on-month while the latter is hardly a world-beating number, being lower than the Eurozone\u2019s own stagnant growth.</p> <p>It is hard to tell whether the Dow\u2019s negative start to the session stemmed from a) the general malaise that engulfed Europe this morning, b) the better than forecast PMIs giving a bit of extra heft to the Fed hawks or c) the fact that the manufacturing figures are still worryingly weak.</p> <p>Regardless the Dow Jones plunged 90 points after the open before settling at a 60-ish point loss, leaving the index at its lowest price in around a week.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-574eecece4b098522011d895\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-01T14:14:49.552Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And there\u2019s more for the US Federal Reserve to consider ahead of this month\u2019s meeting, when a rate rise has still not been ruled out.</p> <p>US construction spending fell 1.8% in April, the largest monthly decline since January 2011.

      "bodyText": "The planned merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse, which is set to create a \u00a321bn pan-European trading giant, is likely to lead to 1,250 job cuts. The prospectus issued to shareholders of both companies said the cuts would be necessary to achieve annual savings of \u20ac450m (\u00a3350m) by 2019 \u2013 a fifth of the combined operating costs. At the same time, more than 550 new jobs could be created in growth areas and through international expansion. A spokesman for the LSE said the job losses would be spread between Frankfurt, London and other international locations over the next three years and would mostly affect technology roles. The aim, he said, was to achieve this through natural wastage, as people retire or leave. The LSE, which owns Milan-based Borsa Italiana, employs more than 3,500 people in the UK, North America, Italy, France and Sri Lanka, while its Frankfurt counterpart has more than 5,200 staff globally. The two companies\u2019 trading and post-trading platforms will be merged, but LCH.Clearnet and Eurex Clearing will remain separate clearing houses. LSE shareholders are to own 45.8% of the new holding company, while Deutsche B\u00f6rse investors will own 54.2%. The two companies said the deal, agreed in March, would create the world\u2019s biggest exchange group by income, and lead to growth opportunities in China, the rest of Asia and North America. The merger is expected to result in extra annual revenues of \u20ac250m within five years. Benefits will come from developing trading and clearing products and combining the index and information services businesses, including the FTSE Russell and Stoxx indices. The enlarged company, which will be incorporated and resident in the UK for tax purposes, will be run by Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s boss, Carsten Kengeter, who is to become chief executive. The LSE\u2019s chair, Donald Brydon, will be chair of the merged group. The LSE\u2019s chief executive, Xavier Rolet, is to leave. The all-share merger is expected to be completed early next year, once it is approved by shareholders and 40 regulators around the world. LSE investors will be asked to back the deal at a meeting on 4 July. Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders have until 12 July to tender their shares, swapping them for stock in the new company. Kengeter talked of a \u201ctruly transformational transaction\u201d that would benefit customers, shareholders and employees. He told analysts and investors that it was the \u201cright transaction at the right time for both companies\u201d, with a \u201cvery good fit\u201d between the two businesses. The prospectus stated: \u201cThe outcome of the United Kingdom referendum on membership of the European Union is not a condition of the merger.\u201d The deal marks the third time Deutsche B\u00f6rse and LSE have tried to merge, after previous attempts at a tie-up failed in 2000 and 2005. If it falls through, Deutsche B\u00f6rse could be vulnerable to a takeover from outside Europe, for example by the Chicago-based CME Group, Kengeter told journalists in Frankfurt. He noted that ICE, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, which walked away from a possible takeover offer for the LSE in early May, could \u201cstep back on to the stage in November\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "In its increasingly desperate bid to revive its fortunes, Marks &amp; Spencer has introduced some radical ideas in recent times \u2013 there was the pre-chopped avocado, then the celebrity designers. Now, it\u2019s getting rid of the music in its stores. In a few weeks\u2019 time, the tills will no longer be alive with the sound of muzak \u2013 good news if you view piped tunes as noise pollution of the worst kind, but the silence may give some of M&amp;S\u2019s sadder stores a graveyard air. It was, says a spokesperson, \u201cthe result of extensive research and feedback from our customers and colleagues\u201d. But silence may not prove golden. Professor Adrian North, head of the school of psychology at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, and an expert on the psychology of music, says he disagrees with the move. \u201cThe research shows that music can have a double-digit impact on sales,\u201d he says, \u201cso turning off that source of revenue is a poor decision.\u201d Music in shops, he says, \u201ccan influence the speed at which customers shop, the amount they browse, the amount they spend, the amount they are prepared to spend, the products they choose, the parts of the premises they visit and the amount of time they think they have spent on the premises\u201d. Different types of music have different effects, too. \u201cWant customers to spend more money? Play classical music. Want them to shop more slowly and browse more? Play slow music. Want to get customers to go upstairs? Play music they like on the stairwell.\u201d Behavioural scientist Patrick Fagan agrees. \u201cThere are three main effects,\u201d he says of music in stores. \u201cOne is a volume and tempo effect \u2013 slow music can make people stay longer in the store. Music can put people in a better mood, which makes them spend more. Third, there is the priming effect \u2013 music can put certain ideas in people\u2019s heads. If you play Christmas music, people will buy more Christmas products. There is a study that shows if you play classical music, rather than Top 40 music, people spend more money on wine.\u201d Of course, not everyone likes the presence of music in stores. One study, commissioned by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (now called Action on Hearing Loss), found that 86% of people with hearing difficulties found piped music annoying and frustrating, and one-third of people in general hated background music. \u201cA great deal of our work involves switching music off,\u201d says Julian Treasure, chairman of the Sound Agency, which designs sound for retailers, workplaces and brands. \u201cRetailers don\u2019t think about why they have music. There are a number of issues. It can be very powerful in the right place, where it is played appropriately. Music is made to be listened to, so you immediately have an issue where you\u2019re playing it in the background like wallpaper. Music doesn\u2019t want to behave like that.\u201d In fashion stores, loud music can be helpful \u2013 it is exciting, vibrant and repels anyone over the age of 23. But playing music in a store like M&amp;S, which is designed to have a broad customer base, is problematic. You wouldn\u2019t want to play death metal in M&amp;S, he says, \u201cso you end up with bland, middle-of-the-road pop and lounge music. It\u2019s very generic, very mindless.\u201d Music, particularly chart music, also carries strong associations, and a song may have negative associations for as many people as positive ones. Furthermore, says Treasure, endless music is fatiguing if it\u2019s deployed mindlessly. He recalls doing an audit of one busy high street several years ago; the only store that wasn\u2019t playing music was M&amp;S (it only introduced it in 2006). \u201cSuddenly, there was a bit of peace. You felt your whole body slow down and you thought, thank goodness.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "London housebuilder Telford Homes has sold almost a quarter of its homes to institutional investors for rent, as demand for \u201cbuilt for rent\u201d developments rises. The company sold The Pavilions in north London, with 156 homes, to housing association L&amp;Q for \u00a367m in February. Last week, it sold another development for rent \u2013 150 homes in Carmen Street in east London \u2013 to fund manager M&amp;G Real Estate for \u00a363m. The housebuilder said: \u201cOver the last 12 months it has become clear that there is now effective institutional demand for high quality, well located developments to be \u2018built for rent\u2019.\u201d It added: \u201cThe sales to L&amp;Q and M&amp;G are just the start of the potential for PRS [private rented sector] to become a permanent and more significant part of the group\u2019s sales mix.\u201d There is growing appetite among City institutions to invest in big rental schemes, which offer steady income. Demand for rented accommodation continues to rise, especially in London, as many people cannot afford to buy their own home. Telford has joined developers such as Berkeley Homes and institutional investors in building blocks of rental homes, shaking up the private rental market, which has traditionally been dominated by individual buy-to-let landlords. Insurer Legal &amp; General teamed up with a Dutch pension fund manager in January to construct 3,000 apartments for rent across the UK. Telford remains heavily reliant on overseas investors, which accounted for 41% of its sales in the year to 31 March. The company sold 68 of 105 homes in the Liberty Building in east London, two thirds of which went to Chinese buyers, and the rest to UK investors, at an average price of \u00a3900 per square foot. The Aim-listed housebuilder reported a 28% rise in pretax profits to \u00a332.2m for 2015, with revenues climbing 42% to \u00a3245.6m. It raised its full-year dividend to 14.2p a share, from 11.1p. Telford stressed that it was not affected by the decline in demand for high-end properties, and pointed to the \u201chousing crisis in London and a clear imbalance between the supply of homes and the needs of a growing population\u201d.",

Last week, it sold another development for rent \u2013 150 homes in Carmen Street in east London \u2013 to fund manager M&amp;G Real Estate for \u00a363m. </p> <p>The housebuilder said: \u201cOver the last 12 months it has become clear that there is now effective institutional demand for high quality, well located developments to be \u2018built for rent\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>It added: \u201cThe sales to L&amp;Q and M&amp;G are just the start of the potential for PRS [private rented sector] to become a permanent and more significant part of the group\u2019s sales mix.\u201d</p> <p>There is growing appetite among City institutions to invest in big rental schemes, which offer steady income. Demand for rented accommodation continues to rise, especially in London, as many people cannot afford to buy their own home.</p> <p>Telford has joined developers such as Berkeley Homes and institutional investors in building blocks of rental homes, shaking up the private rental market, which has traditionally been dominated by individual buy-to-let landlords. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/27/legal-general-to-build-and-rent-out-3000-new-uk-homes \">Insurer Legal &amp; General teamed up with a Dutch pension fund manager</a> in January to construct 3,000 apartments for rent across the UK.</p> <p>Telford remains heavily reliant on overseas investors, which accounted for 41% of its sales in the year to 31 March. The company sold 68 of 105 homes in the Liberty Building in east London, two thirds of which went to Chinese buyers, and the rest to UK investors, at an average price of \u00a3900 per square foot. </p> <p>The Aim-listed housebuilder reported a 28% rise in pretax profits to \u00a332.2m for 2015, with revenues climbing 42% to \u00a3245.6m. It raised its full-year dividend to 14.2p a share, from 11.1p.</p> <p>Telford stressed that it was not affected by the decline in demand for high-end properties, and pointed to the \u201chousing crisis in London and a clear imbalance between the supply of homes and the needs of a growing population\u201d. </p>",

Big luxury brands such as Burberry and Hugo Boss have also been hit by the economic slowdown in China and emerging markets, while terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have deterred overseas tourists from visiting Europe. Hugo Boss is cutting its prices in Asia in response to waning demand for luxury goods. Armani said revenues grew 4.5% in 2015, down sharply from 16% the year before. Revenues totalled \u20ac2.65bn (\u00a32.05bn). Prada, Italy\u2019s biggest fashion house, had sales of \u20ac3.55bn. The Milan-based group, whose products include accessories, cosmetics and furniture, and the more affordable Armani Exchange range, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation edged up 1% to \u20ac513m last year, from \u20ac507m in 2014. Despite the slowdown, the firm said its cash reserves of \u20ac640m allowed it to step up investments in its brands to \u201cfurther strengthen its competitive market position\u201d. The company\u2019s president, Giorgio Armani, founded the company that bears his name in Milan in 1975, and has toyed with the idea of a stock market flotation in the past two decades. The 81-year-old designer is still actively involved in the business and has not revealed any succession plans. /He said: \u201cThese results are the outcome of an attentive diversification policy for the group\u2019s lines, paired with the coordination of distribution channels and enhancement of the role that our trade partners play.\u201d Burberry is cutting jobs as well as its product range after a 10% fall in profit, which was partly caused by a sharp slowdown in China, the British brand\u2019s biggest market.

      "bodyText": "Chrysalis Music co-founder Chris Wright, who signed artists from Blondie and Billy Idol to Spandau Ballet but famously passed on \u201cone-hit wonder\u201d David Bowie, is to be reunited with the legendary label almost three decades after selling up to EMI. Wright, who sold the record company to EMI, 26 years ago, is to return as chairman following its acquisition from Warner Music by music business Blue Raincoat. Warner Music acquired Chrysalis following Universal\u2019s \u00a31.2bn acquisition of EMI in 2012, after regulators forced UMG to sell off a number of subsidiary labels to satisfy competition concerns. Blue Raincoat, co-founded by ex-Chrysalis chief Jeremy Lascelles and Sade producer Robin Millar, has acquired Chrysalis Music for an undisclosed sum. Wright, who co-founded Chrysalis in 1968 with Terry Ellis in a student basement flat, will return as non-executive chairman. \u201cFor me this is an historic and emotional day as Chrysalis is back in the hands of myself and my partners at Blue Raincoat,\u201d said Wright. \u201cWe\u2019ll run it as an independent [label], revitalising the catalogue for the digital age. We believe it can become a new home for many established artists to sit alongside the incredible acts we already have.\u201d Artists already on the Chrysalis Music roster include The Specials, Debbie Harry, Sinead O\u2019Connor, Ten Years After and Ultravox. Wright officially severed all ties with Chrysalis in 2010 when he sold the music publishing arm \u2013 which included Blur\u2019s Damon Albarn, Thom Yorke of Radiohead and Bowie, whom he passed on signing as a recording artist \u2013 for \u00a3107m to BMG UK. In 1971, Wright said he turned down signing Bowie as a recording artist because he seemed a one-hit wonder \u201ca pop artist, not an act with any longevity.\u201d \u201cHe was in our office in Oxford Street all the time, often pleading with us for money to go and make demos,\u201d recounted Wright in media interviews three years ago. \u201cOur receptionist would ring around and we would all pretend to be out.\u201d He also passed on signing Dire Straits, who went on to sell more than 120 million albums, because while he thought they were \u201cvery good\u201d he also found them \u201cvery boring\u201d. And Chysalis bowed out of the bidding war for the Spice Girls, after tabling \u00a3250,000, because executives felt that only one of the band could sing and none seemed to be songwriters. Wright, now 71, made \u00a329m from the sale of the publishing business in 2010, and said at the time that he was moving into \u201csemi-retirement\u201d. Lascelles, whose resume includes working with artists including Phil Collins and Culture Club, said that it was something of a moment getting Wright back on board. \u201cFor him to be reunited with a company that he started nearly 50 years ago is pretty special,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a wonderful moment. Chrysalis Records is for the first time in many years back in the hands of an independent.\u201d After selling the record label to EMI, Wright later set up a radio operation, which included the fast-growing Heart and Galaxy stations, and diversified into television \u2013 making Midsomer Murders and covering Formula 1. However, the City did not care for the mini-media conglomerate he created and the television arm was sold. The radio stations were offloaded to the Tabor family, which now own the UK\u2019s biggest commercial radio group with networks such as Capital, for \u00a3170m in 2007.",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has completed the sale of its long products business to Greybull Capital, in a deal that will preserve 4,400 UK jobs and revive the British Steel name. Tata started talks with Greybull about the sale in December, three months before the Indian conglomerate decided to sell its entire UK business. Greybull, an investment firm, has paid a nominal \u00a31 for the business, which makes products such as railway tracks and steel used in construction. The sale includes the steelworks in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, and sites in Teesside, Workington and York. The business also employs about 400 people in France. Workers accepted a temporary 3% pay cut and changes to terms and conditions in April as part of the deal to salvage the business, which will be renamed British Steel. The brand of the former state-owned industry disappeared in 1999 with the creation of Corus, which Tata bought in 2007. The new logo was unveiled at the Scunthorpe plant on Wednesday. Greybull said the long products business had returned to operating profit in the past two months as the result of a turnaround plan that included making higher-value products. The firm, founded in 2008 by the French-born brothers Nathaniel and Marc Meyohas, said it had \u00a3400m ready to invest in the business. British Steel\u2019s commercial director, Peter Hogg, said jobs at the firm were now secure. \u201cWe have no plans to make any job reductions. The future of the business is based on that strong turnaround plan.\u201d Greybull declined to say whether it had bid for Tata\u2019s other UK steel assets, which employ about 11,000 people and include the blast furnaces at Port Talbot in south Wales. Marc Meyohas said: \u201cOur entire focus has been on getting this deal to where it is and launching British Steel. Being investors in the steel industry you would expect any active shareholder to look at what is going on in the broader market. Tata\u2019s other assets that may be for sale \u2026 we are going to be approached and we are going to be looking at that.\u201d Bidders submitted proposals to buy the business last week. The UK government has offered to provide loans and guarantees to a buyer and has urged Tata to allow time for a deal to be done. Tata is also considering keeping the business in light of the government\u2019s support package. Meyohas said Greybull\u2019s dealings with Tata were tough commercial negotiations but that Tata had behaved in a responsible fashion. Bimlendra Jha, chief executive of Tata Steel UK, said: \u201cAs a responsible seller, Tata Steel is delighted to have secured a buyer for this business and we hope that under Greybull Capital ownership, the business will continue the momentum of the improvement programme that has been initiated in the last 12 months.\u201d Hogg said the long products business would be profitable in the current financial year after withdrawing from plate production, its worst performing business, saving money by closing a coke oven and making about 400 small changes. \u201cIt\u2019s been about making the whole business more cost-competitive, more focused and more agile. It\u2019s a big business but it can have a smaller business feel when it\u2019s not part of a larger organisation,\u201d he said. Hogg said he had lobbied the government to help the steel industry with lower energy prices and business rates, more incentives for research and development and greater use of British steel in infrastructure, from big projects to smaller ones such as a new school or hospital. Paul McBean, the chairman of the multi-union committee at the Scunthorpe works, said: \u201cGetting to this point has taken months of work and commitment from our workforce and I thank them for their support and dedication to the steel industry. I am delighted we are relaunching our fantastic business as British Steel. It marks a new start, and a new chapter, for our business.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A wind of change is howling through the world\u2019s economic institutions. Last week it was the International Monetary Fund saying that austerity could do more harm than good and that neoliberalism was not all it was cracked up to be. This week it is the turn of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to challenge the orthodoxy. The OECD says governments around the world should consider banding together to spend more on public works, something it deems necessary because lasting recovery from the deep recession of 2008-09 remains elusive. There is, of course, a word to describe action by the state to boost demand when private-sector activity is weak, and that word is Keynesianism. It was not a word that was used much in the three decades when neoliberalism reigned triumphant. But times change and after five years in which its forecasts have proved persistently overoptimistic, the OECD is becoming increasingly fretful. It is concerned that weak growth will feed on itself. It is worried that central banks are being asked to do too much with low interest and quantitative easing. It fears that any one of a number of risks \u2013 a hard landing in China, a financial crisis in emerging markets or, most pressingly, Brexit, could lead to activity stalling altogether. It wants something done to break the cycle of low productivity, low wage growth and low investment. What the OECD wants is for the one-legged stool of hyperactive monetary policy to be replaced by a three-legged stool in which central banks get some support from fiscal policy and from structural reform. In an analysis that would have been given the wholehearted support of Keynes, the thinktank says extra spending on infrastructure would pay off in terms of higher growth and lower debt. Governments, in other words, should stop obsessing about cutting their way back to financial health and consider growing their way out of the red instead. Analysis by the OECD shows that the impact in the first year of a 0.5% of GDP increase in public investment by all rich OECD economies would be to boost world growth by 0.4 points. In the US, there would be a 0.7-point improvement; in the EU and the UK a 0.6 point pick-up. The public debt stock in the US would fall by 0.7 points, with smaller decreases of 0.4 points and 0.3 points in the eurozone and the UK respectively. The OECD also notes that there is a significant dividend of about 0.2 percentage points of GDP for countries acting collectively rather than going it alone. In recent years, the OECD adds, the pace of structural reform has slowed and it is not hard to see why. High unemployment, stagnant productivity and nugatory increases in real wages have led voters to be resistant to change \u2013 and in many countries openly hostile to their governments. Stronger, more inclusive growth would make it easier to reform economies and make them more productive. Words, however, come cheap. Just as the IMF\u2019s new thinking about the failings of neoliberalism is not always shared by the officials that give policy advice to countries in economic difficulties, so there is no obvious rush by OECD members to club together for a joint public investment programme. As \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, the OECD\u2019s secretary general, put it: \u201cThey are talking about it but they are not doing it.\u201d Things may need to get worse before the penny drops. If the OECD\u2019s gloomy analysis is right, that moment may not be far off.",

Governments, in other words, should stop obsessing about cutting their way back to financial health and consider growing their way out of the red instead.</p> <p>Analysis by the OECD shows that the impact in the first year of a 0.5% of GDP increase in public investment by all rich OECD economies would be to boost world growth by 0.4 points. In the US, there would be a 0.7-point improvement; in the EU and the UK a 0.6 point pick-up. The public debt stock in the US would fall by 0.7 points, with smaller decreases of 0.4 points and 0.3 points in the eurozone and the UK respectively.</p> <p>The OECD also notes that there is a significant dividend of about 0.2 percentage points of GDP for countries acting collectively rather than going it alone.</p> <p>In recent years, the OECD adds, the pace of structural reform has slowed and it is not hard to see why. High unemployment, stagnant productivity and nugatory increases in real wages have led voters to be resistant to change \u2013 and in many countries openly hostile to their governments. Stronger, more inclusive growth would make it easier to reform economies and make them more productive.</p> <p>Words, however, come cheap. Just as the IMF\u2019s new thinking about the failings of neoliberalism is not always shared by the officials that give policy advice to countries in economic difficulties, so there is no obvious rush by OECD members to club together for a joint public investment programme. As \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, the OECD\u2019s secretary general, put it: \u201cThey are talking about it but they are not doing it.\u201d</p> <p>Things may need to get worse before the penny drops. If the OECD\u2019s gloomy analysis is right, that moment may not be far off.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Uncertainty over Britain\u2019s membership of the EU is hitting a third of businesses in the UK manufacturing sector, which barely scraped growth in May according to a closely watched survey. Foreign demand for goods from British factories fell for a fifth month as firms reported that customers were unwilling to commit to investment ahead of the 23 June referendum. Of the 427 businesses taking part in the Markit/CIPS survey, 27% said a potential Brexit was having a detrimental impact on business, while a further 8% said it was having a strongly detrimental impact. However, 50.8% said they expected it to have no significant effect. David Noble, chief executive at CIPS, said: \u201cIt is likely some manufacturers are maintaining a financial shield as a barrier against the uncertainties still affecting the sector, including those arising from the forthcoming EU referendum.\u201d The question on Brexit formed part of the monthly health check on the UK manufacturing sector, which showed activity at British factories grew by the smallest margin in May. The headline index measuring activity on the Markit/CIPS PMI made it just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, rising to 50.1 in May from 49.4 in April. It was slightly better than the 49.6 forecast, but Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said the survey showed manufacturing continued its \u201clacklustre start to 2016\u201d. He said the PMI suggested manufacturing output, which accounts for about 10% of the economy, was on course for a 0.8% fall in the second quarter, following a 0.4% decline in the first. \u201cThe sector will therefore remain a drag on broader economic growth, adding pressure on the service sector to sustain the upturn in gross domestic product,\u201d Dobson said. James Smith, economist at ING, said: \u201cWe expect growth in the second quarter to slow to around 0.25% quarter-on-quarter, lower than the 0.4% recorded in the first quarter. It would be the slowest rate of GDP growth since the end of 2012.\u201d Campaigners in favour of staying in the EU said the UK manufacturing sector will be badly hit if Britain votes to leave, partly because foreign companies will choose other countries over the UK to open new factories. The EU is Britain\u2019s biggest trading partner and the TUC said highly skilled jobs would be lost because so much was exported from British factories to the EU. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s absolutely clear is that jobs would go. And not just any old jobs: we\u2019d be losing high-pay, high-skill, high-productivity jobs. We\u2019d lose manufacturing jobs that pay \u00a3100 a week more than service sector equivalents. These are good jobs in the regions outside of London that need them most. \u201cOur manufacturing sector, still battered and bruised by the recession, would be hit hard. And inequalities between regions would get even wider. That\u2019s why leading firms such as Airbus UK, BMW Mini and Ford have come out so strongly against Brexit.\u201d The May manufacturing PMI showed domestic demand for goods drove an increase in new orders. Jobs were cut in the sector for a fifth straight month, although the pace of losses slowed in May.",

The car parts, bikes and accessories retailer said pre-tax profit before one-off items edged up to \u00a381.5m from \u00a381.1m in the year to April. Cycling sales fell 0.9% due to a sharp drop in the second quarter though business picked up later in the year. Motoring retail revenues and sales of MOTs and other car services rose 2.5%. Halfords\u2019 fortunes have become linked to the British cycling craze that followed medals for Wiggins and other riders at the 2012 London Olympics. Though motoring makes up about 70% of Halfords\u2019 business, cycling has accounted for much of the group\u2019s growth in recent years. A string of further cycling victories, including Tour de France wins for Wiggins and Chris Froome, and the tour coming to the UK in 2014 maintained momentum. But sales suffered last summer as bad weather deterred casual cyclists from taking to the road or upgrading their kit and competition between retailers drove margins down. The Rio event starts on 5 August and Wiggins will be taking part again along with Laura Trott. Halfords signed up Wiggins in November to help design a range of affordable children\u2019s bikes that go on sale before the Games, while Trott has worked on a women\u2019s range bearing her name. Jill McDonald, Halfords\u2019 chief executive, said: \u201cWhen big sporting events are on, cycling, for example, will probably come more to the forefront of people\u2019s minds. \u201cWe are expecting great things from Sir Bradley and Laura Trott so we hope cycling will be in the minds of the public.

She said after carrying out a review of the British cycling market she expected bike sales to rise 3-5% a year and for Halfords to increase its share of that market. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cToday\u2019s final results from Halfords are at the upper end of the previous \u00a378m-82m profit range but there\u2019s not a lot to shout about.\u201d Halfords\u2019 shares, down by a quarter since early August 2015, fell 5% to 417p.",

The pharmaceutical group\u2019s shares have climbed 105p or 2.4% to \u00a343.65 after a positive note from Credit Suisse, which repeated its outperform rating and \u00a350 price target. Last week investors in US group Baxalta approved a \u00a322bn takeover from Shire, with the deal now expected to complete by Friday. The bank\u2019s analysts said: We publish our updated Shire Baxalta model ahead of the expected deal closing on June 3. We see 5% earnings per share accretion over our stand-alone Shire numbers by 2020. This assumes $500m of operational cost savings, $400m of incremental sales (adding $170m of operating earnings) and a combined group tax rate of 16.5% by 2020... Shire Baxalta combination offers best in class earnings per share growth at an attractive valuation: Shire is well placed to use the ex-US infrastructure from Baxalta to accelerate the commercialisation of the group\u2019s rare disease drugs and is broadening the portfolio away from ADHD. Baxalta adds a number of new areas with attractive growth and high barriers to entry. The positive note from Credit Suisse follows a buy recommendation on Tuesday from Deutsche Bank, which sought to allay concerns about Baxalta\u2019s outlook: We believe investor focus on the threats to Baxalta\u2019s haemophilia franchise mean that the transformational nature of the acquisition has been largely ignored. While we are cognisant of risks on the horizon from potentially paradigm-changing therapies, we believe worst-case investor fears over threats to this franchise are misplaced. Importantly, we see upside to the shares even in bear cases where Baxalta\u2019s franchise sees considerable declines. With our base case forecasts suggesting Shire can deliver a 2016-20 earnings per share compound annual growth rate of more than15% in return for just 13 times 2017 estimated PE, we reinstate our rating at buy.",

The bank\u2019s analysts said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We publish our updated Shire Baxalta model ahead of the expected deal closing on June 3. We see 5% earnings per share accretion over our stand-alone Shire numbers by 2020. This assumes $500m of operational cost savings, $400m of incremental sales (adding $170m of operating earnings) and a combined group tax rate of 16.5% by 2020...</p> <p>Shire Baxalta combination offers best in class earnings per share growth at an attractive valuation: Shire is well placed to use the ex-US infrastructure from Baxalta to accelerate the commercialisation of the group\u2019s rare disease drugs and is broadening the portfolio away from ADHD. Baxalta adds a number of new areas with attractive growth and high barriers to entry.</p> </blockquote> <p>The positive note from Credit Suisse follows a buy recommendation on Tuesday from Deutsche Bank, which sought to allay concerns about Baxalta\u2019s outlook:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We believe investor focus on the threats to Baxalta\u2019s haemophilia franchise mean that the transformational nature of the acquisition has been largely ignored. While we are cognisant of risks on the horizon from potentially paradigm-changing therapies, we believe worst-case investor fears over threats to this franchise are misplaced. Importantly, we see upside to the shares even in bear cases where Baxalta\u2019s franchise sees considerable declines.</p> <p>With our base case forecasts suggesting Shire can deliver a 2016-20 earnings per share compound annual growth rate of more than15% in return for just 13 times 2017 estimated PE, we reinstate our rating at buy. </p> </blockquote>",

Sales at the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket dipped 1.2% in the 12 weeks to 22 May, the worst performance since June last year, taking its market share down to 16.2%, according to the latest figures from Kantar Worldpanel. Ed Garner, director at Kantar, said the drop at Sainsbury\u2019s was the result of a shift in promotional emphasis from multipack deals to straightforward price cuts. Sainsbury\u2019s also recently ditched its brand match promotion \u2013 in which it pledged to refund the price difference if branded goods cost more than at Asda. All the major supermarket chains saw sales fall over the three-month period, but Tesco took Sainsbury\u2019s crown as the best performer as its sales fell by 1%. Asda continued to be the worst performing grocer as it slumped to its lowest market share in 14 years \u2013 15.8% \u2013 as sales fell by 5.1%. The supermarket is struggling to hold on to its price-conscious shoppers who are being tempted away by discounters Aldi and Lidl. Lidl was the UK\u2019s fastest-growing grocer with sales up 14.2% as it sold 65% more of its premium Deluxe range of foods. Aldi\u2019s sales rose by 11.4% \u2013 the chain\u2019s slowest pace of growth since 2011 \u2013 but still much faster than the rest of the market. Garner said: \u201cThis is not just about low prices.\u201d He said shoppers were taking advantage of price cuts to trade up to more luxurious or better quality foods across the board. Aldi\u2019s sales of its premium Specially Selected range rose 15% while Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference and Morrisons\u2019 top Signature ranges both increased sales by about 4%. Prices across the market dropped by 1.5% \u2013 led by fresh produce. Vegetable prices dropped more than 3% and there was also deflation in pork, poultry, butter and eggs. The major chains have been forced to cut prices to combat rising competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. Gardener said 94% of shoppers who visited the two German chains also went to the big four supermarkets but they were increasingly shifting spending to the discounters and other alternatives. Waitrose and the Co-op are also benefiting \u2013 with sales up 2.1% and 3.3% respectively according to Kantar. \u201cCutting fresh food prices is an important weapon for the supermarkets in their battle with the discounters,\u201d said Mike Watkins UK head of retailer and business insight at market analysis firm Nielsen. Nielsen\u2019s figures revealed a 4.1% increase in the volume of fresh produce sold in the four weeks to 21 May as shoppers took advantage of price cuts to eat more healthily.",

      "bodyText": "Sterling volatility has jumped to the highest level in more than seven years after a Guardian poll showed the Brexit camp is in the lead, as the EU referendum campaign picks up pace. One-month implied sterling volatility \u2013 the price of insuring against swings in the pound against the dollar \u2013 rose to 19.6% from 17% a day earlier, as Brexit fears mounted before the 23 June referendum. It was the highest level since the depths of the financial crisis in February 2009, a month before the Bank of England made the unprecedented move of cutting interest rates to an all-time low of 0.5%. Sterling volatility is considered a sign of market anxiety, and Wednesday\u2019s surge followed a Guardian poll that showed voters are 52%-48% split in favour of leaving the EU. The pound tumbled to the lowest level against the dollar in more than two weeks, at $1.4412. Sakis Paraskevov, an analyst at IronFX, told Reuters: \u201cSterling remains sensitive to any new polls that place a leave vote ahead by a considerable margin. \u201cWe expect the volatility in cable [sterling/dollar exchange rate] to continue rising in the coming days, given that polls just a few days before the vote may have a bigger market impact than they did previously.\u201d Most economists believe that a vote to leave the EU would trigger a sharp fall in the pound, while a vote to remain would drive it higher. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned last month that the British economy could slide back into recession if the country votes for a future outside the EU. Uncertainty over Britain\u2019s membership of the EU is hitting a third of businesses in the UK manufacturing sector, which barely achieved any growth in May, according to a closely watched survey published on Wednesday. Foreign demand for goods from British factories fell for a fifth month as firms reported that customers were unwilling to commit to investment before the 23 June referendum. Of the 427 businesses taking part in the Markit/CIPS survey, 27% said a potential Brexit was having a detrimental impact on business, while a further 8% said it was having a strongly detrimental impact. However, 51% said it was having no significant effect. David Noble, the chief executive of CIPS, said: \u201cIt is likely some manufacturers are maintaining a financial shield as a barrier against the uncertainties still affecting the sector, including those arising from the forthcoming EU referendum.\u201d The question on Brexit formed part of the monthly health check on the UK manufacturing sector, which showed activity at British factories grew by the smallest margin in May. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index made it just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, rising to 50.1 in May from 49.4 in April.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s departure from the EU poses as big a threat to the global economy as a \u201chard landing\u201d in China, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has said. The Paris-based thinktank said Brexit would have significant costs not just for the UK and Europe, but for the rest of the world. Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the OECD, said the uncertainty caused by the referendum came at a time when the global economy was caught in a low-growth trap. \u201cSpillovers could be significant to other countries,\u201d Mann said, as she predicted that the world economy would grow by 3% in 2016 and by 3.3% in 2017 \u2013 forecasts that have remained unchanged since its last health check three months ago. \u201cWe have done a lot of work on what a hard landing in China would mean. It is in the same ball park as Brexit.\u201d Analysis by the OECD found that the UK economy would be just under 1.5 percentage points smaller in 2018 after Brexit than it would be if the country voted to stay in the EU on 23 June. But other countries would also face considerable knock-on consequences. The Irish economy \u2013 due to its close trade and financial links \u2013 would be about 1.25 points smaller, the eurozone economy 1 percentage point smaller and growth for the OECD \u2013 a group of 34 rich countries \u2013 would be reduced by just over half a point. Apart from Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg would be the two countries most affected by Brexit, the OECD said. Norway and Switzerland would also be heavily exposed. \u201cThe forthcoming UK referendum on EU membership has already raised uncertainty, and an exit would depress growth in Europe and elsewhere substantially.\u201d Angel Gurria, the OECD\u2019s secretary general, said the global economy continued to \u201climp along\u201d and had failed to break out of its low-growth pattern of the past five years. He said there was a cycle in which \u201cdiminished expectations become self-fulfilling\u201d. Gurria added that the theme of the OECD\u2019s annual ministerial meeting was to enhance productivity in order to boost inclusive growth. \u201cHigh and rising levels of inequality may be contributing to the producitivity slowdown,\u201d he said. Assuming that the UK votes to remain in the EU, the OECD expects growth to ease from 2.3% in 2015 to 1.7% this year, before recovering to 2% in 2017. The OECD has cut its 2016 growth forecast for the UK economy twice in the past six months, having reduced its estimate from 2.4% in November 2015 to 2.1% in February. It is now more pessimistic than the IMF or the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body that produces forecasts for the Treasury. The risk of Brexit had undermined growth, the thinktank said, adding: \u201cThe outcome of the referendum is a major risk for the economy. A vote for Brexit would heighten uncertainty, raise the cost of finance and hamper investment.\u201d Mann said breaking out of the low-growth trap required action on three fronts: the stimulus provided by central banks needed to be backed up by higher infrastructure spending and structural reform. \u201cThe prolonged period of low growth has precipitated a self-fulfilling low-growth trap,\u201d she said. \u201cBusiness has little incentive to invest given insufficient demand at home and in the global economy, continued uncertainties and a slowed pace of structural reform. Negative feedback loops are at work.\u201d",

Heading the fallers is building materials group Wolseley, down nearly 6% to \u00a338.09. The company has reported reasonable third quarter numbers but cautioned on the outlook. Revenues for the three months rose by 10.8% with trading profit of \u00a3230m up 12.2% and it said full year profts would be in line with analyst expectations, before restructuring costs. But it said: Recent revenue growth trends have been weaker...Demand in several of the group\u2019s markets remains subdued and we continue to experience the adverse impact of commodity deflation, particularly in the US. Like for like revenue growth since the end of the quarter has been 1%. Canaccord Genuity said: Third quarter numbers look good with trading profit of \u00a3230m ahead of our around \u00a3215m forecast and the group confirms that it is on track to deliver results in line with consensus expectations for the full year. However, the key focus will be on the outlook comments which state that like for like revenue growth in the weeks since the end of the quarter has been only 1%, which implies a significant slowdown in the US like for like growth performance. Consensus is likely to be broadly similar for this year but may be shaved a touch to reflect higher restructuring costs. The key issue is more the outlook for the next financial year and we would expect consensus to edge on the side of caution and edge numbers down. The shares have enjoyed a good bounce recently and given the current valuation and weaker trading in the US recently, they are likely to edge back until there is more visibility over the outlook into the next financial year. Liberum added: Wolseley has announced strong third quarter figures with like for like sales growth of 2.8% and margins improving from 5.9% to 6.3%. However, the strength of the third quarter will not feed into improving consensus expectations for the full year because management has given lacklustre guidance for the fourth quarter, citing a slow start with like for likes slipping to +1%, and management flagging that it expects more top line restructuring costs in the fourth quarter. We see the shares as close to fair value and believe that the market may be disappointed by the slow start to the final quarter. Stifel said: A soft update with group like-for-like growth of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2016 (3 months end April) and commentary that growth in the weeks since the end of the quarter has been just 1%. Commodity price deflation remains a headache, impacting group growth by 1.4% in the third quarter. The outlook for the full year is maintained at current exchange rates. We expect the shares to come under some pressure today. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 23.61 points at 6207.18, with news that Europe\u2019s manufacturing base slowed to its slowest rate since February, stagnation in China, and barely any growth in the UK. On top of that the OECD has cut its US and UK growth forecasts. Worries about a global slowdown have hit the mining sector, as normal. The strength of the dollar is also have its usual effect by pushing metal prices lower. Anglo American is down 23.6p at 576.5p while Antofagasta has fallen 16.1p to 412.9p. Halfords is another business to unveil a disappointing update. Its shares are down 22.5p at 416.1p as the bicycle and car parts group said 2017 were expected to be flat, before any adverse foreign exchange movements. Housebuilders have been hit by concerns over a possible Brexit after Tuesday\u2019s Guardian/ICM poll, with Taylor Wimpey down 5.1p at 200.3p and Persimmon 52p lower at \u00a320.50.",

    "webTitle": "Vitol: world's biggest energy trader emerges from the shadows", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u201cThe biggest company you\u2019ve never heard of\u201d is a label regularly bandied around but is well-deserved by the global trading firm with a name more suited to a household cleaning product: Vitol. You will not hear its name at this week\u2019s Opec meeting in Vienna or have heard it quoted on the subject of the significant rise in oil prices over the past four months, but a Saudi oil minister would know the name Vitol as they would Shell or BP. Its faceless office-block HQ near Victoria station, London, which it shares with other corporate clients, certainly gives little clue that Vitol (pronounced Veetol) can record larger annual revenues than big corporate firms such as Apple or Volkswagen. It sales last year topped $270bn (\u00a3186.2bn). But a Damien Hirst spin painting in the private company\u2019s foyer hints at the wealth-creating potential of the world\u2019s largest energy trader, where staff at one subsidiary are said to have drawn average salaries of \u00a3750,000 each in one recent year. Its chief executive Ian Taylor might be a guest at Chequers, on the board of the Royal Opera House and keen to be counted in favour of the remain campaign, but otherwise he is a man who stays out of the limelight. The compact, clean-cut and animated Mancunian \u2013 estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List to be worth \u00a3175m \u2013 has broken cover to lobby openly against EU plans to tighten regulation of commodity trading. He argues: \u201cThere is a slight risk that we are being put in the same category as financial derivatives, which will probably mean restrictions on the amount that we can hedge, which will in turn stop us moving so much oil, which in turn will in put the price of energy up in Europe.\u201d Despite past tax and sanctions scrapes, the 59-year-old is keen for Vitol to be seen as a social good rather than some kind of avaricious wheeler and dealer. \u201cI have got nobody doing spec[ulation]. Everyone thinks we spend our lives taking massive punts. But that is just not what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a physical distributor of energy from A to B in the right sizes in the right qualities. We spend a huge amount of time, rightly, on safety and product being on specification. We are very proud of the job we try and do.\u201d Taylor insists that the paper trading by Vitol is only a hedge against the physical trades being undertaken. In fact, he says, the price of oil is neither here nor there for Vitol, which makes much of its profit from the margins between buying and selling. The business also involves some serious hardware, as well as trading screens in its 40 offices worldwide. At any one time, Vitol has 200 ships on charter or under ownership to move some of the almost 270m tonnes of crude and products handled in a year. Vitol also has five oil refineries, 2,700 petrol service stations and even a power plant on Humberside. Oil may be the main commodity bought and sold but there is also coal, iron ore and carbon. Taylor boasts that Vitol was once the biggest mover and shaker in the world of carbon credits until \u2013 in his words \u2013 the business based round the Emissions Trading Scheme in Europe was \u201ckilled\u201d by politicians. Now that business is banking on a trading scheme in California picking up speed amid wider hopes that the UN climate change deal will finally spur new moves to resuscitate a market collapsed by low prices. Low prices are also a problem in the crude arena. Taylor is surprisingly bearish, believing that crude that was running along at $100 a barrel prior to 2014 is set for up to a decade at $40-$60. What of the future of the hydrocarbons that sit at the centre of Vitol\u2019s fortunes? Unsurprisingly, Taylor, who started his post-Oxbridge career with Shell in the late 1970s, does not buy into the \u201cend of the oil era\u201d narrative beloved by environmentalists. He said: \u201cWe still believe that on balance over the next 25 years that oil will be the major transportation fuel in the world and there will be growth \u2013 especially per capita, in places such as Africa and India. \u201cBut we see the power sector moving to gas and renewables, the growth in electric cars. Yes, they are likely to come in but will they make sufficient dents in our business so that it is no longer viable? I think, hopefully not.\u201d \u201cBut in some ways I am very encouraged we are seeing renewables and electric cars because it reduces the likelihood of a nasty spike in the price of oil, which is incredibly damaging to developing countries. \u201cYou don\u2019t want big spikes, so if oil demand starts to decline on a relative basis I am not sure that is a bad thing on a macro[economic] basis.\u201d But it is hard to imagine Vitol itself moving too far from its core competences. The company reinforced its image as a buccaneering business by sending its tankers into Libya at the height of the civil war. It is also credited with helping Kurdistan reduce its ties with Iraq by providing vessels to carry crude exports originating in the landlocked region, at a time when others were frightened of repercussions from Baghdad. Taylor has experience of the Middle East, having lived as a child in Iran at one stage when his father worked for ICI, but not all his experiences have ended well. Vitol was among the 2,200 companies found guilty in the US of providing illicit payments to government officials under the UN oil-for-food programme. Taylor, who joined Vitol in 1985, insists no bribes were ever paid and that the case was politically motivated. \u201cThe payments were surcharges demanded by the state oil company of Iraq [Somo] from all lifters, and were paid to the account of the national Iraqi oil company. They were neither bribes nor kickbacks.\u201d Vitol has also had scrapes with HM Revenue and Customs over a employee benefit scheme for senior staff it set up but later dismantled. Taylor insists this is a thing of the past and that all 200 UK employees are taxed completely normally: \u201cWe are all comfortable paying UK tax.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThe biggest company you\u2019ve never heard of\u201d is a label regularly bandied around but is well-deserved by the global trading firm with a name more suited to a household cleaning product: Vitol.</p> <p>You will not hear its name at this week\u2019s Opec meeting in Vienna or have heard it quoted on the subject of the significant rise in oil prices over the past four months, but a Saudi oil minister would know the name Vitol as they would Shell or BP.</p> <p>Its faceless office-block HQ near Victoria station, London, which it shares with other corporate clients, certainly gives little clue that Vitol (pronounced Veetol) can record larger annual revenues than big corporate firms such as Apple or Volkswagen. It sales last year topped $270bn (\u00a3186.2bn).</p> <p>But a Damien Hirst spin painting in the private company\u2019s foyer hints at the wealth-creating potential of the world\u2019s largest energy trader, where staff at one subsidiary are said to have drawn average salaries of \u00a3750,000 each in one recent year.</p> <p>Its chief executive Ian Taylor might be a guest at Chequers, on the board of the Royal Opera House and keen to be counted in favour of the remain campaign, but otherwise he is a man who stays out of the limelight.</p> <p>The compact, clean-cut and animated Mancunian \u2013 estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List to be worth \u00a3175m \u2013 has broken cover to lobby openly against EU plans to tighten regulation of commodity trading.</p> <p>He argues: \u201cThere is a slight risk that we are being put in the same category as financial derivatives, which will probably mean restrictions on the amount that we can hedge, which will in turn stop us moving so much oil, which in turn will in put the price of energy up in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Despite past tax and sanctions scrapes, the 59-year-old is keen for Vitol to be seen as a social good rather than some kind of avaricious wheeler and dealer. \u201cI have got nobody doing spec[ulation]. Everyone thinks we spend our lives taking massive punts. But that is just not what we do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a physical distributor of energy from A to B in the right sizes in the right qualities. We spend a huge amount of time, rightly, on safety and product being on specification. We are very proud of the job we try and do.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor insists that the paper trading by Vitol is only a hedge against the physical trades being undertaken. In fact, he says, the price of oil is neither here nor there for Vitol, which makes much of its profit from the margins between buying and selling.</p> <p>The business also involves some serious hardware, as well as trading screens in its 40 offices worldwide. At any one time, Vitol has 200 ships on charter or under ownership to move some of the almost 270m tonnes of crude and products handled in a year.</p> <p>Vitol also has five oil refineries, 2,700 petrol service stations and even a power plant on Humberside. Oil may be the main commodity bought and sold but there is also coal, iron ore and carbon.</p> <p>Taylor boasts that Vitol was once the biggest mover and shaker in the world of carbon credits until \u2013 in his words \u2013 the business based round the Emissions Trading Scheme in Europe was \u201ckilled\u201d by politicians. </p> <p>Now that business is banking on a trading scheme in California picking up speed amid wider hopes that the UN climate change deal will finally spur new moves to resuscitate a market collapsed by low prices.</p> <p>Low prices are also a problem in the crude arena. Taylor is surprisingly bearish, believing that crude that was running along at $100 a barrel prior to 2014 is set for up to a decade at $40-$60.</p> <p>What of the future of the hydrocarbons that sit at the centre of Vitol\u2019s fortunes? Unsurprisingly, Taylor, who started his post-Oxbridge career with Shell in the late 1970s, does not buy into the \u201cend of the oil era\u201d narrative beloved by environmentalists.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe still believe that on balance over the next 25 years that oil will be the major transportation fuel in the world and there will be growth \u2013 especially per capita, in places such as Africa and India. </p> <p>\u201cBut we see the power sector moving to gas and renewables, the growth in electric cars. Yes, they are likely to come in but will they make sufficient dents in our business so that it is no longer viable? I think, hopefully not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut in some ways I am very encouraged we are seeing renewables and electric cars because it reduces the likelihood of a nasty spike in the price of oil, which is incredibly damaging to developing countries. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"455354d005a3f89803622790f8daa1b8e13091ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/455354d005a3f89803622790f8daa1b8e13091ac/0_37_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Taylor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CEO Ian Taylor said he does not buy into the \u2018end of the oil era\u2019 narrative favoured by environmentalists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want big spikes, so if oil demand starts to decline on a relative basis I am not sure that is a bad thing on a macro[economic] basis.\u201d</p> <p>But it is hard to imagine Vitol itself moving too far from its core competences. The company reinforced its image as a buccaneering business by sending its tankers into Libya at the height of the civil war.</p> <p>It is also credited with helping Kurdistan reduce its ties with Iraq by providing vessels to carry crude exports originating in the landlocked region, at a time when others were frightened of repercussions from Baghdad.</p> <p>Taylor has experience of the Middle East, having lived as a child in Iran at one stage when his father worked for ICI, but not all his experiences have ended well.</p> <p>Vitol was among the 2,200 companies found guilty in the US of providing illicit payments to government officials under the UN oil-for-food programme. Taylor, who joined Vitol in 1985, insists no bribes were ever paid and that the case was politically motivated. </p> <p>\u201cThe payments were surcharges demanded by the state oil company of Iraq [Somo] from all lifters, and were paid to the account of the national Iraqi oil company. They were neither bribes nor kickbacks.\u201d</p> <p>Vitol has also had scrapes with HM Revenue and Customs over a employee benefit scheme for senior staff it set up but later dismantled. Taylor insists this is a thing of the past and that all 200 UK employees are taxed completely normally: \u201cWe are all comfortable paying UK tax.\u201d</p>",
