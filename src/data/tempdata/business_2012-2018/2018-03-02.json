      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our latest news story on the growing fears of a global trade war: Europe has warned Donald Trump to expect retaliatory strikes against American icons like Harley-Davidson, Levi\u2019s jeans and Kentucky bourbon, if he sparks a trade war by going ahead with punitive US tariffs on foreign steel. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, warned there would be consequences for the US if Trump\u2019s threat of a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium imports takes effect. \u201cIf the Americans impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, then we must treat American products the same way,\u201d Juncker told German television stations. \u201cWe must show that we can also take measures. This cannot be a unilateral transatlantic action by the Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we have to shoot back, but we must take action. \u201cWe will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson, on bourbon and on blue jeans \u2013 Levi\u2019s,\u201d he added. His warning came as the International Monetary Fund said that Donald Trump\u2019s plan would cause international damage \u2013 and also harm America\u2019s own economy. \u201cThe import restrictions announced by the US President are likely to cause damage not only outside the US, but also to the US economy itself, including to its manufacturing and construction sectors, which are major users of aluminium and steel,\u201d the IMF said. Other world leaders also threatened retaliation. Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said US tariffs would be \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d and China too expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over the plans. Meanwhile, the US president breezily asserted that \u201ctrade wars are good\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story: That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Ed Conway of Sky News says the criticism of president Trump\u2019s plans from the IMF is significant: Marketwatch points out that Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to impose new tariffs went down well with one audience -- the US steel and aluminum producers. The American Iron and Steel Institute said it was \u201cpleased\u201d with the tariffs announcement, while the Aluminum Association said \u201cwe appreciate\u201d the president\u2019s commitment to help the aluminum industry. Ding ding goes the Wall Street closing bell. As traders catch their breath after another busy week, the Dow Jones industrial average is down almost 71 points, or 0.3%, at 24,538. That\u2019s a recovery on its earlier losses, but also the fourth daily drop in a row. Big fallers on the Dow included McDonald\u2019s (-4.6%), Caterpillar (-2.3%) and Boeing (-1.1%). The S&amp;P 500, which contains more companies than the Dow, ended up 0.5%. Wall Street is staging a late recovery! In the last few minutes of trading, the Dow is bouncing back from its lows, and the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are now up for the day.... Here\u2019s a reminder that Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico will take the biggest hit from new steel tariffs: Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics suggests the new steel tariffs could scupper the hopes of the US rejoining the NAFTA trade bloc: Canada is mulling its own response to the threat of tariffs on its steel and aluminum sales to the US. As we reported earlier, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said such a move was \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d. A government source has now told Reuters that Ottawa is considering what sanctions it could impose in retaliation. Canada is taking nothing for granted, the source added -- another sign that a trade war could break out.... With 45 minutes to go, the Dow is down 222 points, or 0.9%, and heading for a weekly loss. The vice-president of the European Commission, Jyrki Katainen, has warned that Trump\u2019s new tariffs could trigger a global trade war. Katainen, who is also the former prime minister of Finland, points out that protectionism helped to create the Great Depression of the 1930s. Within Europe, Germany could take the biggest hit from Trump\u2019s new tariffs. That\u2019s because it\u2019s the biggest EU-based exporter of steel to the US: EU countries will also worry that steel will be redirected to them, instead of going to America. An influx of extra imports could hurt their domestic industry (although also deliver cheaper prices to consumers) Business Insider have crunched the latest trade figures to show that Canada would take the biggest hit from the tariffs announced on Thursday: Just in: The governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, has called on Donald Trump to reconsider his decision on steel and aluminum tariffs. He warns that US companies which use steel could be driven abroad, costing Americans their jobs. Here\u2019s our news story on Wilbur Ross\u2019s comments (complete with that tin of soup).... It\u2019s also emerged today that Carl Icahn, a former special adviser to Donald Trump, sold $31.3m of shares in a company heavily dependent on steel imports last week. That was good timing by Icahn - as shares in Manitowoc have fallen sharply since the tariffs were announced. More here: NBC are reporting that Donald Trump announced his plans for steel and aluminum tariffs without any internal review by government lawyers or his own staff. Officials are also claiming that the president was \u2018gunning for a fight\u2019 when he made the decision. It came during a tough week at the White House (including son-in-law Jared Kushner having his security clearance downgraded, and communications director Hope Hicks deciding to step down). NBC says: According to two officials, Trump\u2019s decision to launch a potential trade war was born out of anger at other simmering issues and the result of a broken internal process that has failed to deliver him consensus views that represent the best advice of his team. On Wednesday evening, the president became \u201cunglued,\u201d in the words of one official familiar with the president\u2019s state of mind. A quick market update: The Dow Jones is still wallowing in the red, and currently down 241 points or 1% at 24,367. That follows those hefty losses in Europe today. Caterpillar, the construction and machinery giant, has lost 2% while aeroplane maker Boeing is down 1.6%. They\u2019d both suffer from higher metals prices, and a slowdown in global growth. The broader S&amp;P 500 is slightly down, while the Nasdaq is flat. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund is pleading with Donald Trump not to trigger a trade war. As tensions with Europe rise, fast, the IMF is calling on all sides to work together, rather than descend into protectionism. It fears that these new tariffs would hurt the US economy, as well as other countries. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice says: \u201cThe import restrictions announced by the U.S. President are likely to cause damage not only outside the U.S., but also to the U.S. economy itself, including to its manufacturing and construction sectors, which are major users of aluminum and steel. We are concerned that the measures proposed by the U.S. will, de facto, expand the circumstances where countries use the national-security rationale to justify broad-based import restrictions. We encourage the U.S and its trading partners to work constructively together to reduce trade barriers and to resolve trade disagreements without resort to such emergency measures.\u201d Here\u2019s the full quote from Jean-Claude Juncker, threatening to hit back against America with new tariffs on sales into Europe: \u201cWe will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson, on bourbon and on blue jeans - Levi\u2019s. \u201cWe are here and they will get to know us. We would like a reasonable relationship to the United States, but we cannot simply put our head in the sand.\u201d The EC president was speaking on German TV (via Reuters). Boom!: Europe is threatening to hit back against America, with new tariffs on some famous US names. Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the European Commission, has told reporters that tariffs could be imposed on Harley-Davidson motor bikes, bourbon whiskey and Levi\u2019s jeans. That ratchets up the tensions between the two sides. EC spokewoman Mina Andreeva has tweeted the details: Duncan Robinson of the Economist says it could hit some consumers hard: Wilbur Ross has also confirmed that Trump\u2019s tariffs will be applied globally. That dashes hopes that UK and other European manufacturers might be exempt, and raises the chances of retaliatory action by the EU. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, the commerce secretary explained the president\u2019s thinking: \u201cOf the options that I presented, the president chose one -- which was put broad tariffs on all products from all countries. \u201cWe have to deal with a global problem on a global basis\u201d to stamp out \u201cthis recurring phenomenon\u201d of shipments going through other nations to evade tariffs. President Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, reckons people are over-reacting. He appeared on CNBC earlier this afternoon, to argue that consumers wouldn\u2019t notice any impact from higher steel and aluminium tariffs. In a surprising twist, Ross even produced a soup can to back up his case, saying: \u201cIn a can of Campbell\u2019s Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that\u2019s about six-tenths of 1 cent on the price on a can of Campbell\u2019s soup. I just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?\u201d Only one problem; a Campbell\u2019s spokesperson had earlier warned that new tariffs on imported tin plate steel would indeed push up prices.... More here Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said US tariffs on steel and aluminium would be \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d. He added that he had made this point directly to Trump, and said his officials would continue to engage with all levels of the US government in the coming days. The threat of a trade war in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminium has rattled stock markets, which had already reverted to their volatile ways of a couple of weeks ago. But Trump is not the only concern for European markets, of course. Investors were also nervous ahead of Sunday\u2019s Italian election and the vote in Germany on the same day by members of the SDP party about whether to join a coalition government. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 hit its lowest level since December 2016 as, with all the other worries, investors also had Theresa May\u2019s key Brexit speech to deal with. It is safe to say they were not exactly inspired by the prime minister\u2019s words. Dave Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: We have heard much of it before, and there wasn\u2019t much for traders to latch on to. Mrs May made it clear the UK would like a deal that is geared to its unique needs. The PM once again stated that \u2018no deal was better than a bad deal\u2019, which could prove to be costly. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 105.74 points or 1.47% lower at 7069.90 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.27% to 11,913.71 France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.39% at 5136.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.39% to 21,912.14 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.13% at 9531.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.16% to 813.09 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off its worst levels, down 150 points or 0.6%. The World Trade Organisation has said a trade war is in no one\u2019s interests. In a statement WTO director general Roberto Azevedo said: The WTO is clearly concerned at the announcement of US plans for tariffs on steel and aluminium. The potential for escalation is real, as we have seen from the initial response of others. A trade war is in no one\u2019s interests. The WTO will be watching the situation very closely. More on possible EU retaliation, courtesy Reuters: The market falls are continuing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 1.3%, the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.4% and Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.3%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The selling continues apace across markets this afternoon, with the phrase \u2018sea of red\u2019 getting an outing once more. It is indeed a \u2018risk-off\u2019 afternoon in the old-fashioned sense of the term, with gold being furiously bought as risk assets are dumped unceremoniously overboard. Tariffs do not go down well, it seems. European markets, with their heavy concentrations of industrial stocks, are suffering a double whammy of US tariff concerns and the return of their old foe, a stronger euro. In London the big news has been the speech from the Prime Minister. As ever, it has generated the usual variety of responses, but the aim of conciliatory approach from the UK runs through the text, emphasising the need for both to come together. Given it has been so heavily trailed there has been little market reaction, and the ball now lies in Brussels\u2019 court. While Friday harks back to the crisis days of market volatility, the weekend will resemble those of times past too, as markets wait for results from Germany and Italy. Both are important in their own way, and will help set the tone come Monday, although in the case of Italy maybe no government will be better than one committed to disrupting the established order? The Kremlin may be concerned about the proposed Trump tariffs but Russia\u2019s steel makers should be pretty much unaffected, Reuters is reporting: Russian metals and mining companies face relatively little harm from any introduction of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, analysts and company representatives said on Friday. Russia\u2019s top two steelmakers and its leading aluminium producer saw their share prices fall after President Donald Trump said he would impose hefty tariffs to protect U.S. producers... Russia shares Europe\u2019s concern about the decision, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday, adding that Moscow is \u201ccarefully analysing the situation which is forming in trade relations after this statement\u201d. Russian deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich said he expected some damage to Russia from the new duties, Interfax news agency reported, but he added that any harm would be more significant for the European Union and China. Analysts also said the long-term impact for Russian steel and aluminium producers would be muted. For Severstal, a leading steel producer, and Rusal, the small size of their U.S. sales makes it easy to redirect to other markets, analysts said. The roughly 300,000 tonnes of steel that Severstal exports to the United States can easily be channelled elsewhere, BCS Global Markets experts said. This was echoed by company representatives, who told Reuters the United States accounted for just 2 percent of Severstal\u2019s sales, though the company\u2019s shares were down 2 percent. \u201cAs for aluminium, it is a virtually zero issue as Rusal sells only around 10 percent to 15 percent of volumes there and will send the material elsewhere at virtually no cost,\u201d BCS wrote in a note. Rusal, controlled by businessman Oleg Deripaska, saw its share price fall 3.3 percent. The company did not reply to a request for comment. Russian steelmakers with sizeable exports to the United States would be protected from the impact of tariffs by their U.S. assets, analysts said. Steel producer Evraz, co-owned by Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, exports 0.4 million tonnes of steel slabs to the United States, but its North American assets sell 2.2 million tonnes on the U.S. market, VTB Capital analysts said. Domestic price rises would more than offset the new costs. More indications of a positive US economy, which in turn adds to the case for further interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve. US consumer confidence came in at a better than expected last month, according to the University of Michigan. Its consumer sentiment index rose from 95.7 in January to a final figure of 99.7, better than the expected 99,5 but just below the initial reading of 99.9. The rise came amid the stock market turmoil seen in February and before the latest trade war fears, but followed the Trump tax reforms. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumer sentiment remained quite favorable in February, at its second highest level since 2004. Consumers based their optimism on favorable assessments of jobs, wages, and higher after-tax pay. The highest proportion of households since 1998 reported that their finances had improved compared with a year ago and anticipated continued gains during the year ahead. Economic news heard by consumers continued to be dominated by the tax reform legislation and net job gains, which was untarnished by the consensus view that interest rates would increase and stock prices would remain volatile. Although rising interest rates was seen as a reason to temper their longer term outlook for the overall economy, only a modest moderation in the pace of economic growth was anticipated. Although consumers expected the unemployment rate to dip below 4% in 2018, only modest wage growth was anticipated, and inflation expectations have remained unchanged. Interest rates, even when pushed higher in the weeks and months ahead, will not cause postponement of discretionary purchases as long as income continues to rise near its present pace. Personal tax cuts are crucial to spur additional spending, but unlike prior cuts that had an immediate positive impact, this tax cut has not generated universal support across partisan lines. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.9% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018. A bit of historical context. The last time the US went big on protectionism it ended in the Great Depression. Here\u2019s a piece from my colleague Dominic Rushe from earlier in the year when Trump was also talking tough on trade : With no sign of recovery in stock markets Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: Will we really see the start of a trade war? The truth is, the world relies on the US in one way or the other. Retaliation could only hurt the retaliator. So these warnings may not be backed up by action. In fact, there is even the small possibility that Trump may do a U-turn. However, Trump does seem to enjoy global confrontation and with mid-term elections fast approaching, he may press ahead as he aims to protect domestic companies from what he feels unfair trade arrangements. So, as we head into the weekend, sentiment towards both the stock markets and the dollar are clearly negative. The dollar is doing slightly better against commodity currencies, which tend to be move up and down with risk appetite changes. However, against the euro and in particular, the yen, a safe haven currency, the greenback looks rather weak. An economist\u2019s view of the Trump tariffs: The prospect of a trade war prompted by Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports has unsurprisingly sent US markets sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 322 points or 1.2% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite just over 1%. More from Trump, policy by tweet: European Aluminium, a Brussels based association representing more than 600 plants in 30 European countries, has called on the European Commission and the EU to protect the industry in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariff plans. It said: \u201cWe regret President Trump\u2019s decision to impose a tariff on all aluminium imports independent of their country of origin. European aluminium exports to the US, in view of both their quantity and characteristics, do not pose any threat to US national security. \u201cMost importantly, this blanket tariff does not address the root cause of the main challenges faced by the aluminium industry today: the unsustainable and steady increase of aluminium overcapacities in China. \u201cThis global challenge can only be managed effectively through a global and long-term solution based on multilateral rules and common enforcement such as the creation of a Global Aluminium Forum within G20,\u201d commented Gerd G\u00f6tz, Director General of European Aluminium. These unprecedented measures threaten to destabilize global trade flows. As a result of the tariff, European Aluminium fears a disruption of the current trading relationship between the United States and Europe, which have strongly interlinked value chains and a significant number of multinationals operating in both territories. The association also expects that the measures will likely result in a redirection of aluminium products from third countries to Europe. Decisive actions must be taken to neutralise effects on European companies. \u201cThe European value chain is already under enormous pressure due to global overcapacities, the announced measures put thousands of jobs in over 600 plants, many of which are SME\u2019s, in countries such as Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Sweden and Central and East European countries at risk. We urge the European Commission and EU Member States to implement without further delay actions to protect our industrial interests, in line with international trade rules\u201d concludes G\u00f6tz. Speaking of possible European retaliation, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said there would be a co-ordinated European response if the move went ahead. He told reporters all options were on the table and there would be a \u201cstrong, unilateral and co-ordinated\u201d response from the EU. He added: These unilateral measures are not acceptable. They would have a major impact on the European economy and French companies like Vallourec and Arecelor. [Quotes courtesy Reuters] Long gone are the days when Donald Trump hailed the spectacular performance of the stock market: The American Chambers of Commerce in the EU is also not happy with the President\u2019s tariff proposals: US government plans to impose tariffs and limits on imports of steel and aluminium on the basis of national security, authorised under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, would fail to appropriately address legitimate concerns regarding global overcapacity. It also risks a deterioration in transatlantic economic and political relations that could threaten jobs, investment and security on both sides of the Atlantic. The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU (AmCham EU) shares the US government\u2019s concerns regarding global overcapacity of steel and aluminium, which can hurt domestic jobs in the EU and the US and encourage unfair trading practices. However, this decision would unfairly target European manufacturers and would not address Chinese excess capacity, the root cause of the issue. As referenced by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the decision could lead to retaliatory measures by the EU against US companies and also could contravene World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. American companies employ more than 4.7 million workers in Europe, with aggregate US investment totalling more than \u20ac2 trillion in 2017. Susan Danger, CEO, AmCham EU, said: \u201cAddressing global overcapacity of steel and aluminium requires coordinated action by the EU and the US. Unilateral US government actions would fail to address this issue and instead risk harming America\u2019s relationship with Europe, its staunchest ally.\u201d President Trump\u2019s planned tariffs may not actually take place, says Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics. But if they do, there is likely to be retaliation. He says: Steel and aluminium account for about 2% of world trade, so the direct impact on the global economy of the tariffs President Trump announced yesterday would be minimal. But the fact that they are being justified under a flimsy pretext of national security increases the risks of retaliation. Will these tariffs actually be implemented? Not necessarily: after all, we are talking about Trump! He said he will sign the executive order next week, but there will doubtless be opposition from Congressional Republicans, US corporations and US allies. This, and the dip in the stock market, may cause Trump to change his mind. And it is possible that when the order is written it will allow exceptions for allies, such as Canada and Germany, who (unlike China!) are big sources of US steel imports.... Will other governments retaliate? Probably. Canada has said it would \u201ctake measures to protect its domestic trade interests and workers\u201d; Brazil has said the same; and the EU has reportedly discussed possible targets for retaliation. Other governments may also move to protect their own steel industries, which would be legal under WTO terms. That said, we suspect that any retaliation, from these countries and China, would be targeted and proportionate in order to try to prevent the problem escalating. What is the biggest risk? The real worry is that this marks a turning point in US trade policy, away from bluster and brinkmanship towards actual protectionist measures. We have consistently warned that this would become more likely as the mid-term and presidential elections approach. If so, President Trump may discover that, contrary to his tweet this morning, there are rarely any winners from trade wars. An influential member of the European Parliament has warned that Europe must retaliate if the US imposes tariffs on steel and aluminium. Manfred Weber, chairman of the EPP Group of centre-right MEPs, suggested that Europe would need to throw its forces into any trade war, saying: \u201cThe US President is playing a very dangerous game. A trade dispute is to the detriment of everyone. But if Donald Trump increases tariffs on European goods for no reason, then Europe must react. Priority must be given to protecting jobs in Europe. The EU has to show its strength.\u201d The Wall Street Journal has generally taken a more positive view of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency than rival newspapers (to the anger of some staff). But not on this occasion. Today, the WSJ editorial board have roasted the president\u2019s move on tariffs, saying it will hurt the US economy and weaken his own efforts. It begins: Donald Trump made the biggest policy blunder of his Presidency Thursday by announcing that next week he\u2019ll impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum. This tax increase will punish American workers, invite retaliation that will harm U.S. exports, divide his political coalition at home, anger allies abroad, and undermine his tax and regulatory reforms. President Trump just sent another tweet, defending his tariffs (in the face of widespread criticism from home and abroad) If a trade war is really breaking out, then kitchen equipment maker Electrolux has just fired another shot - by threatening to pull investment in America. Reuters has the details: Sweden\u2019s Electrolux, Europe\u2019s largest home appliance maker, said on Friday it would put on hold a planned $250 million investment in the United States after President Donald Trump announced he would impose tariffs on imported aluminium and steel. \u201cWe are putting it on hold. We believe that tariffs could cause a pretty significant increase in the price of steel on the U.S. market,\u201d Electrolux spokesman Daniel Frykholm said. Economics professor Adam Posen has roundly blasted the idea of imposing fresh tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium into the US. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNBC the plan was \u201cjust straight up stupid,\u201d, adding: This is fundamentally incompetent, corrupt or misguided.\u201d Posen also took issue with President Trump\u2019s argument that he was protecting US jobs and industries, as: Steel is just a tiny input in the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 which is why it\u2019s so crazy. According to CNBC, there were roughly 140,000 Americans employed in steel mills in 2015, while 6.5 million Americans worked in industries that consumed steel. More here. The Mexican peso is sliding this morning, making it the worst-performing major currency against the US dollar. Trump\u2019s protectionist stance on trade wars and tariffs are undermining hopes that America could rejoin the NAFTA pact. The European Commission has warned it will impose countermeasures against America, if new tariffs are imposed on EU aluminium and steel. EC president Jean-Claude Juncker has vowed to \u2018react firmly\u2019 to president Trump\u2019s move, saying: \u201cInstead of providing a solution, this move can only aggravate matters. The EU has been a close security ally of the US for decades. We will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk. The EU will react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests. The Commission will bring forward in the next few days a proposal for WTO-compatible countermeasures against the US to rebalance the situation. Russia has also expressed concern over Donald Trump\u2019s plans. In a daily briefing with journalists, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow shares European capitals\u2019 concern with reports of the adoption of new steel and aluminium tariffs by the United States. \u201cThis situation deserves close attention,\u201d Peskov, who serves as a personal spokesman to Russian President Vladimir Putin, told journalists by phone. Peskov added: \u201cWe know that extreme concern has been expressed in many European capitals with these kinds of decisions. We share this concern and are carefully analysing the situation which is unfolding now in trade relations after this announcement.\u201d Stock markets are falling deeper into the red, following Donald Trump\u2019s declaration that America could easily win a trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 is now down 73 points, or 1%, at 7101. That\u2019s a new three-week low. Mining companies are suffering from the prospect of protectionism - as demand for iron ore, coal, copper, oil and nickel would all weaken. Germany\u2019s DAX is still lurching around a six-month low. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says investors around the globe are worried: A negative vibe lingered across financial markets on Friday, after Donald Trump\u2019s vow to impose severe tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium sparked fears of a global trade war. In a move that dealt a blow to global sentiment, Trump said on Thursday that the United States would set tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminium. This bombshell development is likely to fuel concerns of retaliatory actions from major US trade partners consequently weighing on risk appetite. Investors are clearly jittery by the threat of a potential global trade war and its possible effect on stock markets. Wall Street is also expected to suffer falls when it opens in three hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called down around 200 points, or 0.9%. That would add to yesterday\u2019s 420-point tumble. Newsflash: President Trump has tweeted that it will be easy for America to win a trade war: That\u2019s unlikely to calm nerves in the financial markets.... David Lowe, head of international trade at law firm Gowling WLG, predicts that president Trump could announce more protectionist policies in the weeks ahead. Lowe says: \u201cAll the figures suggest that the first year of any administration is the calm before the storm. The groundwork is done and the wind builds. Now Trump\u2019s first year is complete with the potential for the floodgates to open, it\u2019s safe to assume this may not be the only shock policy announcement.\u201d A recent report from Gowling found that the USA has the biggest protectionist stance across the world. Since 2009, it has made 1,085 more protectionist measures more than liberalising ones. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former head of Nato and ex-Danish prime minister, warns that tariffs will hurt a range of US businesses who use steel. He also fears that Europe could face pressure to become more protectionist too. Canada, Brazil and Russia will all be hit hard by new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into America, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. They say: The countries that will be hardest-hit by the tariff include some of the US\u2019s biggest trading partners. The commerce department reported that the biggest importers of steel in 2017 were (in descending order) Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Russia. China was 11th, supplying just 2% of the total. For aluminium, the biggest importers were Canada, Russia, China, the UAE and Bahrain. (China supplied 11% of the total.) The EIU also expect other countries to hit back: We expect other countries, notably China, to retaliate in kind. The tariffs are a particular snub to the Chinese government, which had sent its leading trade envoy, Liu He, to Washington to discuss the US-China relationship. Earlier this week, the EIU warned that a trade war would be a major threat to global stability. Yesterday\u2019s comments from Trump haven\u2019t changed that view... Bank of England Mark Carney is discussing cryptocurrencies now - there\u2019s a live feed here. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in a media interview that he was\u201cextremely concerned\u201d about Donald Trump\u2019s planned tariffs on steel and aluminum. \u201cA sweeping move against the rest of world by the US\u201d, Gabriel told the Funke group of newspapers, \u201cwould hit our exports and jobs amongst the hardest\u201d. Gabriel said: \u201cI hope that President Trump reconsiders his announcement. We need to do everything possible to avoid an international trade war.\u201d The president of the Federal Association of German Industry, Dieter Kempf, described America\u2019s \u201cpolicy of partition\u201d as a mistake, adding: \u201cUS president Donald Trump is risking a world-wide trade conflict and a spiral of protectionism that will end up also costing American jobs\u201d. President Trump\u2019s plan to slap tariffs on steel and aluminium imports has gone down badly with the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market think-tank. Kate Andrews of the IEA it will hurt Americans: Mark Carney has also warned that Bitcoin looks like a bubble, and could have a \u2018pretty brutal reckoning\u2019 Breaking: Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has suggested greater regulatory controls over cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. He has labelled them as \u201c inherently risky\u201d and that they are \u201cfailing\u201d to fulfil their most basic function as money. Carney say governments should \u201cregulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities, promote market integrity, and protect the safety and soundness of the financial system.\u201d He said Threadneedle Street was currently considering the risks posed to UK financial stability by bitcoin and other digital currencies, and that the Bank would report to the G20 in Argentina later this month. At present, cryptocurrencies \u201cdo not appear to pose material risks to financial stability\u201d, says Carney, but that they \u201ccould rise\u201d in future as more people begin to use them. Speaking in London because the snow stopped him from reaching Edinburgh to deliver a speech at the inaugural Scottish Economics Conference, he said cryptocurrencies were failing to meet the key tests of money set by the 18th Century Scottish economist Adam Smith - the father of modern capitalism. \u201cCryptocurrencies act as money at best, only for some people and to a limited extent, and even then only in parallel with the traditional currencies of the users. According to the governor, bitcoin has been too volatile to act as a store of value - failing a major test set of currencies - while he also said it was an inefficient means of exchange as no major high street retailers accept the digital currency. Roy Rickhuss, the head of the Community union, fears that jobs will be lost in the UK and the US if these tariffs are imposed. Conservative MP Simon Clarke is also very concerned about the impact on Britain\u2019s steel industry: Clarke, who represents Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, is also vice chairman of the of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Steel. Back to tariffs.... and British unions are very alarmed by the prospect of America imposing swingeing costs on steel and aluminium imports. Richard Warren, head of policy at UK Steel, fears that president Trump will impose \u2018blanket measures\u2019 on all steel imports, regardless of their origin. Warren says this would be an \u201cextremely blunt\u201d way of tackling the problem of overcapacity in the global steel industry. This requires a coordinated global approach. Whilst we all too well understand the frustrations of the US sector, measures such as these smack of short-termism, protectionism and would be rife with unintended consequences for global trade and for the users of steel in the US. \u201cAt a UK level, our sector exports some \u00a3360 million worth of high-value steel products into the US each year, almost 15% of our exports. These measures, would seriously undermine our ability to compete in this market. Equally there is significant apprehension about the indirect impacts of these measures in the form of steel trade diverted away from the US to other markets, such as the UK. In short, these measures would cause serious damage to the prospects of many steel producers here. UK Steel is urging Theresa May to push for \u201ca robust response from the EU\u201d, adding: \u201cIf next week\u2019s official announcement does reveal the worst, there is a strong message here for the UK Government as well. In its imagined post-Brexit role as the vanguard for global free trade, it must remember that not everyone is on the same page and not everyone is playing by the same rules. Whilst we have to resist any urge to mirror such protectionist moves, we must at the same time be clear-eyed and equip ourselves with tools to respond effectively and protect our interests when necessary.\u201d Newsflash: Activity across Britain\u2019s building sector picked up last month, but remains weak. Data firm Markit reports that commercial construction strengthened in February, but civil construction and housebuilding was weaker. Builders reported that new work decreased for the second month running, while total business activity increased only marginally. Markit says: Anecdotal evidence suggested that fragile business confidence and ongoing political uncertainty remained key factors holding back client demand. This pushed the monthly construction PMI, which measures activity, up to 51.4 from 50.2 (which was close to stagnation). In other news, the Weinstein Company has been saved from bankruptcy. The firm, co-founded by disgraced media mogul Harvey Weinstein, is being acquired by an investment team led by billionaire Ron Burkle and Maria Contreras-Sweet, the former head of President Obama\u2019s Small Business Administration. It had been expected to fold, after talks with Burkle and Contreras-Sweet\u2019s group had hit deadlock. Contreras-Sweet says the move will save 150 jobs, protect the small businesses who are owed money and create a victims\u2019 compensation fund for those who suffered from the sexual harassment scandal. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s main stock index, the Dax, has hit a six-month low. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has said he\u2019s \u2018very concerned\u2019 by Donald Trump\u2019s move, and called on the EU to respond decisively. Speaking to German media, Gabriel says he hopes Trump will reconsider the tariffs announced last night. China has expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over US plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, with the move likely to hurt US allies as well as Chinese producers. Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that the US will impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on imported aluminium next week sent stock markets around the world tumbling and could prompt other countries to take action. The Chinese side expresses grave concern,\u201d the ministry of commerce said. The statement did not mention any retaliatory steps but encouraged Washington to solve disputes through negotiation. Chinese officials have previously said they would take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to defend national interests. Australia\u2019s government is already scrambling to protect its manufacturers from the impact of new tariffs on steel and aluminium. It is \u201curgently lobbying the Trump administration for an exemption\u201d to the move, according to the AAP newswire. Here\u2019s more details: Federal Trade Minister Steve Ciobo labelled the decision, which comes a week after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull raised the issue with the president in Washington DC, \u201cdisappointing\u201d. \u201cThe imposition of a tariff like this will do nothing other than distort trade and ultimately, we believe, will lead to a loss of jobs,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney on Friday. The government is concerned retaliatory measures by other major economies could trigger a slowdown in the global economy. \u201cThat is in no one\u2019s interest,\u201d Mr Ciobo said. History shows that trade wars aren\u2019t good for stocks - and encourage nervous investors to pile into safe-haven government debt instead. European steelmakers are being hit this morning, with ArcelorMittal\u2019s shares down 2%. Across the markets, the industrials sector has lost 1% while basic materials is down 0.9%. Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index has hit its lowest level since 12 February, as worries of a trade war sweep through the City. The FTSE 100 shed 42 points, or over 0.5%, at the start of trading in London. Mining companies are among the fallers, as investors calculate that slapping tariffs on steel and aluminium could hit demand for commodities. Other European indices are also falling in early trading; Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 1% and France\u2019s CAC has shed 0.75% as traders worry about the implications of Trump\u2019s move. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The negative open follows a sharply lower close on Wall St that flowed into Asia overnight after President Trump sparked concerns of a protectionist trade war with China and the EU by announcing his intention to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminium. Several experts have warned that Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports could trigger retaliatory action, and even a full-blown trade war: Robert Carnell of ING \u201cThe world stands on the brink of a trade war as Donald Trump announces severe tariffs on steel and aluminium... this is how recessions start. \u201cTrade is just about the only thing economists are agreed on - more is better.\u201d Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada As had been foreshadowed yesterday, President Trump announced new tariffs on Steel (25%) and aluminium (10%) imports late yesterday. Many of the US\u2019s main trading partners have said they will respond with reciprocal action. Generally, restrictions on world trade would be less negative for relatively closed economies, like the US, and hence positive for USD. But the risk of a bilateral trade war with China makes the current situation different, given China\u2019s large holdings of USTs. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group Under the pretext of national security, Trump has announced tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. However, it still remains unclear whether this will be applied to imports from all countries or just some. Whilst one of Trump\u2019s aims is to encourage China to reform its practises, the reality is that Canada and Brazil are bigger exporters to the US than China. Whilst market eyes have been firmly on interest rate expectations and recent volatility, no one was preparing for a potential trade war. The broader market sold off as these tariffs are creating and uncertain environment trade wise and the market hates any interventionist policy from governments. Whilst US steelmakers and aluminium makers rallied hard following the announcement, the Dow closed 430 points lower, whilst the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq closed 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The markets are taking a hammering this morning after Donald Trump slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium. The US president announced plans to impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel, and 10% on aluminium \u201cfor \u201ca long period of time\u201d. In another example of his America First agenda, Trump told metal industry bosses that: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have protection for the first time in a long time.\u201d We don\u2019t have full details of the plan yet. But the broad-brush announcement has triggered fears of retaliatory action from other countries, notably China. A trade war could slow global trade, undermine globalisation, hurt economic growth and push up costs. Wall Street reacted swiftly last night, sending the Dow Jones down 420 points. Asia has been hit too, and European markets are dropping in early trading (more on that shortly). As my colleague Dominic Rushe reports: The Nikkei index in Japan fell 2.4%, Hong Kong and South Korea were down 1.6%, and the ASX200 in Sydney was off 1% in early afternoon trading. Asian steelmakers bore the brunt. South Korea\u2019s Posco fell 3% and Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel 4%. Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in Sydney said it was a \u201csharp reminder of the initial negative reaction to the election of Mr Trump ... An explanation may come, but the initial market interpretation of the move is rank populism. The lack of structure makes anticipating further measures and possible responses to retaliatory moves difficult to predict.\u201d Also coming up today We find out how Britain\u2019s building sector fared in February, when Markit releases its monthly construction PMI. Traders will be watching the pound closely, as Theresa May gives a big speech on Brexit. The PM is expected to urge both sides of the Brexit debate to reunite for the good of the country.... There may be some disappointed faces in Edinburgh. Bank of England governor Mark Carney had been due to address the inaugural Scottish Economics Conference in person - but due to the snow, he\u2019ll scrapped the trip and will speak by video link. We also discover how Canada\u2019s economy fared in the last three months of 2017. The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI for February 10am GMT: Mark Carney speaks to the Inaugural Scottish Economics Conference. 1.30pm GMT: Canadian GDP 1.30pm: Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech",

Its consumer sentiment index rose from 95.7 in January to a final figure of 99.7, better than the expected 99,5 but just below the initial reading of 99.9. The rise came amid the stock market turmoil seen in February and before the latest trade war fears, but followed the Trump tax reforms.</p> <p>The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumer sentiment remained quite favorable in February, at its second highest level since 2004. Consumers based their optimism on favorable assessments of jobs, wages, and higher after-tax pay. The highest proportion of households since 1998 reported that their finances had improved compared with a year ago and anticipated continued gains during the year ahead.</p> <p>Economic news heard by consumers continued to be dominated by the tax reform legislation and net job gains, which was untarnished by the consensus view that interest rates would increase and stock prices would remain volatile. Although rising interest rates was seen as a reason to temper their longer term outlook for the overall economy, only a modest moderation in the pace of economic growth was anticipated. </p> <p>Although consumers expected the unemployment rate to dip below 4% in 2018, only modest wage growth was anticipated, and inflation expectations have remained unchanged. Interest rates, even when pushed higher in the weeks and months ahead, will not cause postponement of discretionary purchases as long as income continues to rise near its present pace. Personal tax cuts are crucial to spur additional spending, but unlike prior cuts that had an immediate positive impact, this tax cut has not generated universal support across partisan lines. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.9% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c237e8f0e14ff65174806b10073301fd8f9cdaf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c237e8f0e14ff65174806b10073301fd8f9cdaf9/0_0_1126_737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"usconsum2march\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a9967b3e4b01f2a011d994e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dominic-rushe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-02T15:06:23.747Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A bit of historical context.

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWe regret President Trump\u2019s decision to impose a tariff on all aluminium imports independent of their country of origin. European aluminium exports to the US, in view of both their quantity and characteristics, do not pose any threat to US national security.</p> <p>\u201cMost importantly, this blanket tariff does not address the root cause of the main challenges faced by the aluminium industry today: the unsustainable and steady increase of aluminium overcapacities in China.</p> <p>\u201cThis global challenge can only be managed effectively through a global and long-term solution based on multilateral rules and common enforcement such as the creation of a Global Aluminium Forum within G20,\u201d commented Gerd G\u00f6tz, Director General of European Aluminium.</p> <p>These unprecedented measures threaten to destabilize global trade flows. As a result of the tariff, European Aluminium fears a disruption of the current trading relationship between the United States and Europe, which have strongly interlinked value chains and a significant number of multinationals operating in both territories. The association also expects that the measures will likely result in a redirection of aluminium products from third countries to Europe. Decisive actions must be taken to neutralise effects on European companies.</p> <p>\u201cThe European value chain is already under enormous pressure due to global overcapacities, the announced measures put thousands of jobs in over 600 plants, many of which are SME\u2019s, in countries such as Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Sweden and Central and East European countries at risk. We urge the European Commission and EU Member States to implement without further delay actions to protect our industrial interests, in line with international trade rules\u201d concludes G\u00f6tz.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a9957aee4b092021077b885\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-02T13:59:10.842Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking of possible European retaliation, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said there would be a co-ordinated European response if the move went ahead.</p> <p>He told reporters all options were on the table and there would be a \u201cstrong, unilateral and co-ordinated\u201d response from the EU.

      "bodyText": "The US commerce secretary has said Donald Trump\u2019s proposed trade tariffs are \u201cno big deal\u201d as they will only increase the cost of an average car by $175. In an interview with CNBC, Wilbur Ross also used a tin of Campbell\u2019s soup and a can of Budweiser to demonstrate how Trump\u2019s plan to introduce a 25% import tax on steel and a 10% import tax on aluminium would have minimal impact on consumers. Republican members of Congress have criticized Trump\u2019s tariffs, with the House speaker, Paul Ryan, saying the import taxes could have \u201cunintended consequences\u201d. Ross told CNBC that there is \u201cabout 1 ton of steel in a car\u201d, NBC\u2019s Carl Quintanilla reported. \u201cThe price of a ton of steel is $700 or so, so 25% on that would be one half of 1% price increase on the typical $35,000 car. So it\u2019s no big deal,\u201d Ross said. Using Ross\u2019s math, the increase would be $175. To further illustrate his point Ross used a can of soup, a can of Budweiser and a can of Coca-Cola. \u201cThis is a can of Campbell\u2019s soup,\u201d Ross said as he held up a can of Campbell\u2019s soup to the camera. The soup appeared to be Chicken Noodle flavor. \u201cIn the can of Campbell\u2019s soup there\u2019s about 2.6 cents, 2.6 pennies, worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 that\u2019s about six-tenths of one cent on the price of a can of Campbell\u2019s soup.\u201d Ross said he had purchased the can on Friday morning at a 7/11 store. He said it cost $1.99. \u201cSo who in the world is going to be too bothered by six-tenths of a cent?\u201d Ross asked. The commerce secretary then presented a can of Coca-Cola. He said it had three cents worth of aluminium in it. \u201cSo if that goes up by 10% that\u2019s three-tenths of a cent. I just paid $1.49 for this can of Coke. It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Ross said \u201call this hysteria is a lot to do about nothing\u201d. Trump announced the tariffs during a meeting with US industry officials on Thursday. The New York Times reported that Trump\u2019s plan came \u201cagainst the wishes\u201d of his trade advisers, including Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council.",

Icahn, a billionaire investor who was a major Trump supporter, started selling shares in the crane and lifting equipment supplier Manitowoc Company on 12 February, days before the commerce department first mooted plans to impose stiff tariffs on foreign steel imports. The news was first reported by Think Progress. On Thursday Trump said he would press ahead with the commerce department\u2019s plans to levy 25% tariffs on imports of steel and 10% on aluminium. According to a regulatory filing Icahn was able to sell his shares for $32 to $34. On Friday morning Manitowoc\u2019s shares had fallen 5.48% to $26.37. The fall was in line with drops seen by other companies dependent on cheap steel imports, including Boeing and Caterpillar. Trump has argued that the tariffs are necessary to protect US jobs. \u201cWe must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON\u2019T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON\u2019T HAVE A COUNTRY!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. The announcement has rattled stock markets around the world and stoked fears of a trade war with both the EU and China saying they are considering retaliation if the tariffs become law. Icahn, who has a fortune of $16.9bn according to Forbes, sold 1m shares in Manitowoc, according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The value of the shares he sold has since dropped by around $6m. The investor was a special adviser to Trump during the election but resigned his position amid concerns about potential conflicts of interest relating to his vast business holdings. Icahn was not immediately available for comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The 2 Sisters Food Group at the centre of a meat factory scandal was guilty of regulatory failures and poor hygiene at its poultry plants, according to a report by the Food Standards Agency. The FSA inspected sites operated by 2 Sisters, one of the UK\u2019s largest chicken suppliers, following a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation at the firm\u2019s West Bromwich plant last year, which raised questions over the firm\u2019s food standards and prompted it to suspend production there for five weeks. Ranjit Singh Boparan, the founder of the group, stood down as chief executive of the firm on Tuesday after 25 years, following the revelations which also led to major supermarkets suspending purchases from the firm. In a report published on Friday by MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs committee, the FSA said it had reviewed CCTV footage at the poultry plants between 2 July and 18 August last year to gather evidence. \u201cThis provided evidence of sporadic poor hygiene and bad practice, such as inadequate use of protective clothing, placing of knives on unhygienic surfaces or inadequate cleaning procedures but did not represent widespread systematic failures,\u201d the FSA concluded. \u201cOn some sites the tests for salmonella were completed using poultry cuts, instead of neck skins which was in breach of legislative requirements. \u201cThe report highlights several process weaknesses and regulatory failures found at 2SFG plants.\u201d Undercover filming by the Guardian and ITV showed workers altering slaughter dates on batches of chickens and reintroducing to the production line poultry which had been dropped on the floor. 2 Sisters had claimed there was an innocent explanation for changing the date labels. However, the FSA concluded: \u201cNo justification for this incident of label changes could be established.\u201d The FSA said there was also CCTV footage of cleaners placing meat that should be disposed of as by-products into a bin: \u201cThe use of the bin contents cannot be established from the CCTV.\u201d In response to the Guardian and ITV\u2019s allegation that freshly killed chicken was mixed on the production line with chicken killed at earlier dates, the FSA said: \u201cIt was possible for small amounts of meat from a previous production run to be used in another, whether or not the latter was from the same source and/or with the same kill date.\u201d The FSA said it was satisfied that the company had resolved the issues identified through \u201ccorrective actions\u201d. 2 Sisters has also agreed to install upgraded CCTV systems in all its processing plants, to improve staff training, introduce a mystery worker programme, and improve the group\u2019s corporate culture. However, Tory MP Neil Parish, chair of the EFRA committee, was critical of the FSA: \u201cThis report today focuses on the past issues at 2 Sisters, but we have recommended that the FSA makes a range of changes for the future. The FSA must gather and collate all the information that comes from the retailers\u2019 own inspections of the meat processing plants.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The high street crisis spread on Friday as Mothercare said it was in talks with its banks, and Sports Direct increased its stake in another struggling retailer, Debenhams. In the wake of Carpetright\u2019s profit warning on Thursday, and the collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin earlier this week, Mothercare became the latest retailer to reveal it was in financial straits as poor trading put it at risk of breaching the terms of its loans. Mark Newton-Jones, the Mothercare chief executive, said it was in talks to raise the funds needed to for a turnaround programme that involves the closure of almost half of its 152 UK stores as sales move online. \u201cReflecting the more challenging trading environment and our seasonal cashflows, we are working with our financing partners with respect to our financing needs for the 2019 financial year and beyond,\u201d said the company in a statement. \u201cWe forecast our borrowings to increase towards the limit of our facilities at various points from the start of the new financial year, and will therefore require waivers of certain financial covenants.\u201d The company added: \u201cWe are also exploring additional sources of financing to support and maintain the momentum of our transformation programme.\u201d Mothercare\u2019s shares have lost more than a third of their value this week and are now at an all time low of 21p. With its shares in freefall the company, which has an \u00a380m hole in its pension pot, is now worth just \u00a337m. It is shaping up to be one of the blackest weeks for the high street since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis with both Toys R Us and Maplin, two of the high street\u2019s best known retailers, entering administration on Wednesday, casting doubt over the future of 5,500 jobs and 300 stores. In January, Mothercare issued a profit warning in the wake of poor Christmas sales with Newton-Jones blaming a softening of demand with fewer visitors to its stores and website. On Friday the retailer said sales had been in line with expectations since its January warning with profits for the year expected to be at the bottom of the \u00a31m-5m range expected by the City. \u201cWe are working together with all our stakeholders, including colleagues, franchisees, financiers, suppliers and pensions trustees on this next phase of our transformation and their part in delivering these plans,\u201d said Newton-Jones. \u201cThe support already being shown gives us confidence that, despite the challenges, there remains a clear way forward for Mothercare to realise its ambition to be the leading global retailer for parents and young children.\u201d With retail shares coming under pressure this week Sports Direct put out a surprise statement urging Debenhams to stock its brands in more of its UK stores and to work together online and overseas. Sportswear tycoon Mike Ashley has been toying with Debenhams since 2015, but it is now the retailer\u2019s biggest shareholder after increasing Sports Direct\u2019s holding for a second time this week to 29.7%, just shy of the level that would trigger a bid for the company. Debenhams shares are worth 29p, down from 54p a year ago as the chief executive, Sergio Bucher, struggles to turn the business around. \u201cWe see huge value for both companies in a strategic partnership between Debenhams and Sports Direct,\u201d said Liam Rowley, the Sports Direct head of strategic investments. \u201cThere are obvious synergies that can be achieved through the integration of our respective web operations. We also see opportunities to work together internationally. \u201cImportantly, there is scope for greater collaboration in the UK in order to roll out an elevated offering to consumers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned that bitcoin faces a regulatory crackdown, warning that \u201cinherently risky\u201d cryptocurrencies are failing to fulfil their most basic function as money. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, used a speech in London on Friday to attack a situation of \u201canarchy\u201d in the trading of cryptocurrencies, with the market having grown rapidly on unregulated exchanges. He said the time had come to \u201cregulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities\u201d. His warning comes amid growing efforts around the world to bring bitcoin under the control of central banks and governments, amid fears of consumers losing money at the hands of market manipulation. There are also growing efforts to curb the risk of cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering, financing terrorism and drug dealing. Bitcoin hit almost $20,000 (\u00a314,500) in value in the run-up to Christmas, before crashing by more than half earlier this year, although it has since recovered to almost $11,000. \u201cAuthorities are rightly concerned that given their inefficiency and anonymity, one of the main reasons for their use is to shield illicit activities. This cannot be condoned. Anarchy may reign on the dark web, but in the UK it\u2019s just a song that your parents used to listen to,\u201d Carney said, in a speech which will be seen as a major intervention by a top global regulator. Threadneedle Street has been studying the risks posed to UK financial stability by bitcoin and other digital currencies, as well as the potential uses of the technology underlying them, for several years. The Bank will present a report to the G20 in Argentina later this month, with Carney hinting at greater controls and also revealing that the central bank had tested ways to use cryptocurrency technologies at the core of the British payments system. Backers of bitcoin have said the underlying technology has potential to revolutionise the financial system and make everyday payments easier and cheaper. Carney said the central bank would continue to study the use of distributed ledger technology which underlies cryptocurrencies. He said that, at present, bitcoin and other digital currencies \u201cdo not appear to pose material risks to financial stability\u201d but that could change in future as more people begin to use them. \u201cYou worry about people that get caught up every time you have exploitative behaviour,\u201d he said. The governor\u2019s comments follow repeated warnings from leading economists, finance industry bosses and other monetary authorities around the world. The European Union has warned it will regulate cryptocurrencies if its risks increase, while China has moved to shut down bitcoin exchanges and clamped down on initial coin offerings, where cryptocurrency tokens are sold to individuals.",

But something may be stirring. For almost the first time since Melrose launched its \u00a37bn reverse takeover bid, GKN\u2019s shares are trading consistently above the value of the offer. GKN closed on Thursday at 435p versus an offer, which is mostly in the form of Melrose shares, worth 413p. And that was before the FT\u2019s report on Thursday night that GKN is talking to US group Dana about a deal to sell or combine its automotive division. The gap isn\u2019t huge, but the position is more encouraging for GKN than a fortnight ago. Back then, it was too easy for Melrose to portray GKN\u2019s chief executive, Anne Stevens, as a semi-retired recruit hauled from the non-executive benches and who could make only vague promises about corporate self-improvement. GKN\u2019s big plan, called Project Boost, does still require investors to take a lot on trust. But there were clear long-term cashflow forecasts in the mix, a promise to return \u00a32.5bn to shareholders plus a firm commitment to demerge the two halves of the company \u2013 aerospace and automotive \u2013 by the middle of next year. A demerger in itself should add no value. In practice, the move would address the old complaint that the stock market awards the lower rating - in this case, an automotive one - to any engineering group that serves two markets. Life shouldn\u2019t work that way, but sometimes does. Project Boost won\u2019t convince everybody, but it prompted Jefferies\u2019 analyst, for example, to place a valuation range of 448p to 523p on GKN\u2019s stock. At the very least, it is probably safe to assume, even if Melrose were to walk away tomorrow, that GKN\u2019s shares wouldn\u2019t tumble all the way back to their pre-action level of 326p. A price around 370p or 380p might be more like it. Viewed that way, Melrose\u2019s current offer worth 413p looks outright mean. The real takeover premium is miserable. Yes, as the bidder keeps saying, one can view share-based takeover offers as a debate about which management team to prefer. On that score, Melrose\u2019s record of enriching investors still puts it ahead in City eyes. But takeovers are also about fundamental value. In this case, all that has really happened is that Melrose has spotted an undervalued business and is offering lowball terms to own it. The 57% share of the pie that would go to GKN shareholders is short by several slices. The business select committee will hear from both sets of management next Tuesday. Melrose\u2019s crew, presumably, will be quizzed about asset-stripping, debt, pensions and the rest of it. And, if they\u2019re being fair, MPs will also give Stevens a hard time over whether her demerger plan for GKN is any less dangerous to the long-term interests of UK manufacturing. In the absence of a wider public interest test on takeovers that Theresa May has failed to deliver, that encounter is important. MPs may be able to extract a few long-term promises from Melrose about investment in research and development in the UK that can be turned into binding commitments by the Takeover Panel. But there\u2019s also the here-and-now question of value. That one seems straightforward. GKN\u2019s defence is hopeful, but not wildly so. As things stand, Melrose isn\u2019t offering enough. Nothing like. Zero-based budgeters It was not a pretty year, says Sir Martin Sorrell. He wasn\u2019t talking about his pay packet - which will probably still count as beautiful by conventional standards - but about the advertising giant WPP\u2019s results for 2017. He\u2019s right. Everything from revenues to profits to margins went roughly flat. The intriguing part, however, was Sorrell\u2019s explanation. He said it had little to do with attempts by Google and Facebook to cut out agencies by luring advertisers directly to their doors. Instead, he blamed cost-cutting by big multinationals under siege from \u201czero-based budgeters, activist investors and private equity\u201d. The latter phenomenon is clearly genuine. Unilever, Nestle and Procter &amp; Gamble, in various ways, are under pressure from investors to boost profit margins. Trimming perceived fat from advertising budgets is an easy short-term win, even if Sorrell thinks it is self-defeating in the long-term. Yet he should surely be more cynical about the ambitions of Google and Facebook and their digital co-travellers, consultancies. A large chunk of his presentation was devoted to reasons for the technology giants not wanting to \u201cdisintermediate\u201d advertising agencies and see them instead as partners.

The firm entered administration on Wednesday after the search for a buyer failed. It is being wound down by the restructuring company Moorfields, which said the first round of store closures would begin in the coming days. Around 3,200 staff face redundancy following the collapse of the 100-store chain. It is not clear which brands remain in stock as some major suppliers, thought to include Lego, are understood to have taken their products back to avoid the heavy discounting. Toys R Us said on Friday it had stock of the brands on its website.

The problems cast doubt on the future of the loss-making UK chain, which was cut adrift several weeks ago. Toys R Us dates back to the 1950s in the US, but did not arrive in the UK until 1985. The retailer is known for megastores in out-of-town retail parks, but has been outflanked in recent years by Amazon and the toy store chain Smyths.

    "webTitle": "E.ON hikes bills for 1m customers on coldest spring day on record", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Around a million households face higher bills for gas and electricity after the big-six power firm E.ON quietly increased prices on the coldest spring day on record. Comparison sites and consumer groups described the move, expected to be the first of a series of price increases from energy providers, as devastating news for hard-pressed households. The average annual increase will be \u00a322, but one in four households on the firm\u2019s standard variable tariff (SVT) will have to pay an extra \u00a350 a year. The timing of E.ON\u2019s move, which the company said was designed to make their charges easier to understand, was branded a stealth hike for the way the changes have been introduced. They will take effect on 19 April. E.ON is not increasing the unit price of electricity and gas, but is removing \u00a330 worth of dual fuel and paperless discounts for customers on standard variable tariffs, meaning they will see a rise of 2.6%, taking a typical annual bill to \u00a31,153. The backdoor approach appeared designed to evade political flak, but a Whitehall source said the move was \u201canother example of the big six unfairly attacking customers on standard variable tariffs\u201d. E.ON insisted its changes would \u201cmake it simpler and easier for customers to understand our tariffs and compare them with other suppliers in the market\u201d. The price comparison site Comparethemarket.com said it was disappointed to see tariff simplification used as an excuse to raise prices. \u201cThere is little justification for removing discounts and certainly not in the name of making billing simpler,\u201d the site\u2019s head of energy, Peter Earl, said. E.ON also blamed unspecified rising costs. Analysts said earlier this week that another round of price increases from the big six was on the way, primarily because of rising wholesale electricity and gas prices. One smaller supplier, Bulb, increased its prices this week by \u00a324 a year for its 300,000 customers, citing wholesale costs. The E.ON increase was not announced to the press or to the public via social media, but was revealed late on Thursday by the price comparison site Energyhelpline. Mark Todd, the site\u2019s co-founder, said: \u201cAlong with the current icy blizzards that are pushing up all our bills already, these price rises are doubly bad news for millions of E.ON customers.\u201d The consumer group Which? urged people on poor-value tariffs to switch supplier, saving themselves as much as \u00a3305 a year. The exact changes by E.ON will vary by region, but dual-fuel customers on the SVT who pay by cheque and cash will be hit hardest. They will face a \u00a320 increase in their standing charge, a further \u00a320 increase because the dual-fuel discount is being removed and a \u00a310 increase with the removal of the paperless discount. The move came after the government put legislation before parliament this week to cap energy bills for 11m households by the end of the year. Ministers hope the policy will get royal assent before the summer recess, enabling the cap to come in next winter. The business secretary, Greg Clark, has told energy suppliers not to obstruct the cap, but E.ON is not expected to be alone in raising prices before its imposition. Data from Ofgem this week showed the costs facing energy suppliers had risen 7.9% between August 2017 and February this year, \u201cdriven primarily by increases in wholesale gas and electricity costs\u201d. Freezing temperatures this week have seen unusually high demand for gas, which will boost energy firms\u2019 revenue after relatively low demand last year because of mild weather. National Grid has withdrawn the gas deficit warning it issued on Thursday, after a spike in wholesale prices secured more supplies. Demand, however, is still high, with a forecast of 403.4m cubic metres on Friday, compared with around 300m usually.",

      "body": "<p>Around a million households face higher bills for gas and electricity after the big-six power firm E.ON quietly increased prices on the coldest spring day on record.</p> <p>Comparison sites and consumer groups described the move, expected to be the first of a series of price increases from energy providers, as devastating news for hard-pressed households. The average annual increase will be \u00a322, but one in four households on the firm\u2019s standard variable tariff (SVT) will have to pay an extra \u00a350 a year.</p> <p>The timing of E.ON\u2019s move, which the company said was designed to make their charges easier to understand, was branded a stealth hike for the way the changes have been introduced. They will take effect on 19 April.</p> <p>E.ON is not increasing the unit price of electricity and gas, but is removing \u00a330 worth of dual fuel and paperless discounts for customers on standard variable tariffs, meaning they will see a rise of 2.6%, taking a typical annual bill to \u00a31,153.</p> <p>The backdoor approach appeared designed to evade political flak, but a Whitehall source said the move was \u201canother example of the big six unfairly attacking customers on standard variable tariffs\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2018-03-02T18:08:59/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Energy prices\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2018-03-02T18:08:59/embed.html\">Energy prices</a> </figure>  <p>E.ON insisted its changes would \u201cmake it simpler and easier for customers to understand our tariffs and compare them with other suppliers in the market\u201d. </p> <p>The price comparison site Comparethemarket.com said it was disappointed to see tariff simplification used as an excuse to raise prices. \u201cThere is little justification for removing discounts and certainly not in the name of making billing simpler,\u201d the site\u2019s head of energy, Peter Earl, said.</p> <p>E.ON also blamed unspecified rising costs. Analysts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/27/get-ready-for-a-new-round-of-energy-price-rises-industry-analysts\">said earlier this week</a> that another round of price increases from the big six was on the way, primarily because of rising wholesale electricity and gas prices.</p> <p>One smaller supplier, Bulb, increased its prices this week by \u00a324 a year for its 300,000 customers, citing wholesale costs.</p> <p>The E.ON increase was not announced to the press or to the public via social media, but was revealed late on Thursday by the price comparison site Energyhelpline.</p> <p>Mark Todd, the site\u2019s co-founder, said: \u201cAlong with the current icy blizzards that are pushing up all our bills already, these price rises are doubly bad news for millions of E.ON customers.\u201d</p> <p>The consumer group Which? urged people on poor-value tariffs to switch supplier, saving themselves as much as \u00a3305 a year.</p> <p>The exact changes by E.ON will vary by region, but dual-fuel customers on the SVT who pay by cheque and cash will be hit hardest. They will face a \u00a320 increase in their standing charge, a further \u00a320 increase because the dual-fuel discount is being removed and a \u00a310 increase with the removal of the paperless discount.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The move came after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/26/plans-to-cap-domestic-energy-bills-weak-and-confused-say-mps\">put legislation before parliament this week</a> to cap energy bills for 11m households by the end of the year.

      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government admits it has no idea if Australia will be exempt from US president Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, despite claiming last year that it would escape the levies. Ministers have warned that the tariffs could spark a trade war and lead to global recession, and say Australian officials are scrambling to learn the details of the plan. World stock markets tumbled on Friday after Trump announced he would next week impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on imported aluminium, in an attempt to shield local manufacturers from global competition. Steve Ciobo, the Australian minister for trade, held a press conference on Friday to voice his concerns, warning the tariffs could lead to a breakdown in trade relations. \u201cAs you would all be aware, we have been pursuing this issue amid rumours about a possible imposition of action like this for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly last week, the prime minister and I had the opportunity to raise this matter directly with the president and other senior members of the Trump administration to indicate that Australia\u2019s view is that there should be an exemption for Australian steel and aluminium products. \u201cThe imposition of a tariff like this will do nothing other than distort trade and ultimately we believe will lead to a loss of jobs. \u201cBlueScope Steel, which has operations on the west coast of the United States, employs 3,000 people in California and Washington state, and their activities would be affected. \u201cAt this point in time, we don\u2019t have clarity from the administration on whether an exemption will be in place for Australia. \u201cIt will be a unilateral imposition of tariffs across the board. I put the call through to the US commerce secretary and have requested ... to speak as soon as possible to go through the detail of this announcement. He also warned that Trumps\u2019s tariffs could lead to retaliatory action from other countries, and that could lead to recession. \u201cIf we see a breakout of action and reaction from major economies, the only thing that will arise from that will be a slowdown in economic growth and, over time, if that got bad enough, we could see a recession,\u201d he said. He said the US and Australia had a \u201cvery strong bond\u201d and he hoped the two countries could come to an agreement. In July last year, the Turnbull government claimed that it had secured an exemption from such tariffs. At the time, it said the exemption would protect Australia\u2019s US$130m steel exports to the US and its $62.5m aluminium exports to the US. It would also protect the interests of BlueScope, the sole exporter of Australian steel. But on Friday, Ciobo downplayed the importance of the US market for Australian exporters. \u201cWe should not lose sight of the fact that our steel and aluminium exports only account for a very small percentage of the US import market,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of Australia\u2019s steel exports, they account for about 0.8%, aluminium for about 1.5%. They are very modest.\u201d",

Details of a plan drawn up by accountancy firm EY, but rejected by directors, emerged as MPs conducting an inquiry into Carillion\u2019s failure released evidence they said proved \u201cpervasive institutional failings\u201d at the company. They published extracts from a presentation made by EY to the board in August 2017 as part of an exercise called \u201cProject Ray\u201d, which they said cast doubt on directors\u2019 claims of a sudden descent caused by several external factors. The presentation highlighted longstanding company-wide failings including a shortage of expertise and transparency, inefficient corporate structures and a lack of \u201ccommercial acumen\u201d. After presenting its findings, EY monitored Carillion\u2019s cashflow on a month-by-month basis, warning in October that the company was in danger of insolvency by March 2018. The accounting firm produced two scenarios, one of which was an unplanned insolvency that would see just \u00a349.6m recovered from the business, including \u00a312.6m for pensioners. It also offered a second option that could have raised \u00a3364m by breaking up the company and selling profitable assets prior to liquidation, securing \u00a3218m for a retirement scheme now estimated to be nearly \u00a31bn in deficit. MPs on the work and pensions committee and business committee said the board \u201cdismissed a break-up as not practical, instead choosing to believe they could successfully restructure [the business].\u201d A spokesperson for the company\u2019s former executives said: \u201cThe recommendation of the company\u2019s advisers was to start to progress a debt for equity transaction with financial stakeholders and this was supported by the board.\u201d Documents released by the committee detailed EY\u2019s many concerns about Carillion\u2019s corporate culture after completing Project Ray. The accountants flagged up a \u201clack of professionalisation and expertise\u201d, as well as the \u201cconsistent use of quantity of people to compensate for limitations in quality or skill set (particularly commercial acumen).\u201d There were also too many layers of management, according to EY, while short-term benefit was prioritised over sustainable performance amid a \u201cculture of non-compliance\u201d. Work and pensions committee chair Frank Field said the papers \u201creveal a wholly deficient corporate culture, studded with low-quality management\u201d. \u201cThey reveal also pervasive institutional failings of the kind that don\u2019t appear overnight; long-term failings that management must have been well aware of,\u201d he added. Minutes of an August 2017 board meeting show that Carillion directors admitted the possibility that the longevity of some of its staff had led to \u201cwilful blindness\u201d about the firm\u2019s shortcomings. Business committee chair Rachel Reeves said directors \u201ceither took their eye off the ball or they failed to see the warning signs that investors, Carillion staff and [...] EY flagged to them. \u201cDirectors didn\u2019t just drop the ball once, they made a habit of it, giving every indication that it was the long-term failings in the management and corporate governance at Carillion which finally sank the company.\u201d Separately, former Carillion chair Philip Green has stepped down from his role as chair of Sentebale, Prince Harry\u2019s charity dedicated to supporting children in southern Africa affected by HIV.",

      "bodyText": "The voice of Australia\u2019s coal lobby is under renewed threat as the country\u2019s second biggest miner, Rio Tinto, faces a shareholder revolt over its membership of lobby groups including the Minerals Council of Australia and the role it plays in Australia\u2019s climate and energy debate. Global investors worth $84bn have joined together to file a shareholder motion calling on Rio Tinto to rethink its membership of the MCA, NSW Minerals Council (NSWMC) and the Queensland Resources Council (QRC). It demands Rio Tinto reveal all membership fees paid since 2012, review the consistency of the MCA\u2019s lobbying positions with those held by Rio Tinto, and disclose what it would take for Rio to quit its membership of the MCA. The action was coordinated by the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), which is fresh from successfully forcing the country\u2019s biggest miner, BHP, to agree to similar demands. If the campaign successfully forces both companies to leave the MCA, it would remove about a third of the MCA\u2019s revenue from membership fees. As such, even the threat of leaving could force the MCA to shift its lobbying positions. When ACCR coordinated a similar motion filed at BHP\u2019s annual general meeting, despite it not winning a vote, BHP agreed to conduct a review of industry associations. That review announced plans to leave the World Coal Association, and declared BHP would quit the MCA if it did not change the way it lobbied for coal. The resolution filed today was submitted by the Australian Local Government Super, the Church of England Pensions Board and the Seventh Swedish National Pension Fund (AP7). Together they have $84bn worth of assets under management, and collectively are thought to hold more than $100m worth of Rio Tinto shares. The resolution is unlikely to gain a majority of votes at the two AGMs held in the UK and Australia (Rio is listed in London and Sydney), but even a significant minority of votes would send a strong signal and could secure a win for ACCR, as it did with BHP. Despite BHP already agreeing to many of the demands before the AGM voted on the resolution, and the board recommending shareholders vote against it, about 10% of shareholders voted in favour. Brynn O\u2019Brien, the executive director of ACCR, said that was significant, and anything above 5% was taken very seriously by a board. O\u2019Brien expected more shareholders to support the Rio Tinto motion because it was backed by large institutional investments, unlike the BHP motion, and hoped the board would recommend that shareholders support the motion. \u201cWe think this is really in the company\u2019s interest, so the board should support it and recommend that shareolders vote for it,\u201d she said. Such a move would not be unprecedented for Rio Tinto. In 2016, the company was faced with a shareholder motion calling for greater transparency on how it deals with climate risk, and the board supported it, recommending shareholders vote in favour. Bill Hartnett, head of sustainability at Local Government Super, one of the co-filers of the motion, said high energy prices in Australia were a result of the prolonged climate and energy debate here, and that was harming the value of their investment in Rio Tinto. \u201cWe estimate that these high electricity prices are adding tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to Rio Tinto\u2019s overall costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shareholder value in supporting industry groups with contrary energy and climate positions is not clear to LGS, particularly as Rio has exited the thermal coal business in Australia.\u201d Adam Matthews, head of engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, said Rio\u2019s support of the Paris climate agreement demanded that it not support lobbying that is counter to the agreement\u2019s aims. \u201cFor Rio Tinto to be part of the solution to climate change requires consistency in all the company\u2019s activities and from the organisations it supports to lobby on its behalf,\u201d Matthews said. The wording of the resolution is similar to that filed with BHP, and laments climate and energy policy, when it exists in Australia, being \u201cshort-lived policy subject to relentless scrutiny and adversarial campaigning by industry bodies\u201d. It also outlines the way the MCA and other pro-coal lobby groups supported by Rio Tinto have campaigned for the destruction of Australia\u2019s carbon tax and mining tax, and pushed for government funding for coal power stations. O\u2019Brien said the shareholder motion is part of a growing and unstoppable movement from investors around the world. \u201cThe drumbeat of opposition to coal lobbyists like the Minerals Council of Australia is only growing louder. The interest by European funds in this resolution reflects the fact that Australia\u2019s inaction on climate and energy has impacts beyond our borders,\u201d she said. Dylan Tanner is executive director of InfluenceMap, a UK-based NGO that tracks how corporations influence climate policy around the world. He said his group has seen a rise in interest from investors to improve the role companies in their portfolios play in climate and energy debates. \u201cWe have detected a genuine uptick in concern recently and I personally feel 2018 will be the year shareholders get tough on companies who maintain links to egregious lobbyists holding back critical policy progress on a key existential threat to our common future,\u201d he said. The shareholder revolt has come on the same day as the corporate regulator began legal proceedings in the federal court against Rio, its former chief executive Tom Albanese, and its former chief financial officer Guy Elliott. The proceedings relate to statements in Rio Tinto\u2019s annual report for 2011, which the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) alleges were misleading or deceptive. In December 2010, Rio announced a takeover offer for Riversdale Mining Limited which was completed in August 2011 at a total cost of over US$4bn. Following the acquisition, Rio delisted Riversdale and renamed it Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique. Asic alleges that Rio Tinto engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by misrepresenting the reserves and resources of Riversdale in its 2011 annual report. On 17 January 2013, Rio Tinto announced it expected to recognise a non-cash impairment charge of approximately US$14bn (post-tax) in its 2012 full-year results, including roughly US$3bn relating to Riversdale. It was also announced that Albanese, an American, had stepped down from his role as CEO.",
