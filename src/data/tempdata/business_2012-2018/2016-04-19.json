The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will announce a levy to raise $120m over four years for Asic, the same amount of money that was cut by the former prime minister Tony Abbott in the 2014 budget. \u201cThis will strengthen it [Asic] further,\u201d the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told Sky News on Wednesday. \u201cThe cost will be borne by the banks.\u201d The new measures will help give Asic a \u201csharper edge to tackle wrongdoing\u201d, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told 5AA Radio. But those pushing for a royal commission say the money does not go far enough. \u201c[The money is] effectively returning some of the resources that they stripped away,\u201d the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, told ABC Radio. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to do the job.\u201d Morrison is also expected to announce a new commissioner, who will be tasked with investigating banking misconduct, and a strengthening of the role of financial services ombudsman. Earlier this month Labor announced it would hold a royal commission into banking impropriety if it wins the upcoming federal election. Opinion polls released this week show that the proposal has broad support in the community. Turnbull insists the government\u2019s new measures for Asic are \u201cnot a response to anything that has happened recently\u201d. \u201cThis is an issue we\u2019ve been addressing methodically,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus has been on getting action here.\u201d The prime minister on Tuesday faced unrest from his backbench over the need for stronger action against the banks. The Nationals senator John Williams, who has long called for a royal commission into banking behaviour, said the new measures are \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d. \u201cThe banks ... want to clean up their act as well. I think these are good measures that Scott Morrison will put in place,\u201d he told ABC Radio. He acknowledged that Asic had \u201clifted its game\u201d but did not rule out pushing for a royal commission in if banking scandals continue. \u201cIt may well be on the agenda in the years to come,\u201d Williams said. Labor will continue to push for a broad-ranging inquiry. \u201cThe truth of the matter is nothing less than a royal commission will be satisfactory,\u201d the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, told Channel Nine. \u201cThe banks don\u2019t want a royal commission and Mr Turnbull doesn\u2019t want a royal commission but there are tens and thousands of customers who have been ripped of. \u201cWe hoped things would get better but they haven\u2019t so I do believe that a royal commission with its wide-spread powers will get to the bottom of it.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Housebuilding in Britain grew at the slowest rate in almost three years during the first quarter of 2016, with the latest industry survey showing planning delays and EU referendum uncertainty weighing on the sector. Private housebuilding \u201cslowed considerably\u201d during the first three months of the year, despite the government\u2019s promise to support new infrastructure and building programmes, and its pledge to deliver 200,000 new homes by 2020, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said. A Rics survey of the construction sector found that workloads among housebuilders increased at the weakest rate since the second quarter of 2013. It revealed a slowdown across all parts of the construction industry and showed that confidence about the outlook for the sector over the next 12 months had fallen. Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at Rics, said: \u201cOur survey tells us that planning delays are one of the biggest barriers to growth in the construction sector. We have recommended that councils work together to create a team of emergency planners who can parachute into boroughs that are experiencing significant delays, therefore reducing a major growth barrier. \u201cThat said, we cannot discount the climate of uncertainty caused by the forthcoming EU referendum. We know that a range of sectors have been affected by these issues as investors look to delay any decisions until a final outcome has been determined, and construction is no exception.\u201d Rubinsohn suggested that a slowing construction industry seemed at odds with George Osborne\u2019s \u201cwe are the builders\u201d pledge at the 2015 Conservative party conference. \u201cOne might well ask why growth in private housing workloads is softening at a time when policy is firmly focused on the creation of new starter homes. We have long held the view that starter homes cannot be the only solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an issue around the availability of land on which new houses can be built and we would like to see more being done to free up private brownfield sites.\u201d A breakdown of the Rics survey showed that only 36% more of those working in the private housebuilding sector saw workloads rise than fall over the first quarter of 2016. It was the weakest figure since the second quarter of 2013 and compared with 50% in the first quarter of 2015. On a more positive note for the construction industry, respondents expected head counts to rise by an average of 2% over the next 12 months, following employment growth of 4% in 2015. The UK construction sector was badly affected by the financial crisis and output is still not back to its pre-recession level. Construction output grew by 0.3% in the last quarter of 2015 and economists are expecting a small positive contribution to UK GDP in the first quarter of this year. The Office for National Statistics will publish an estimate of first quarter growth on 27 April. Economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research expect the data to show that overall growth halved from 0.6% to 0.3% between the last quarter of 2015 and the first three months of 2016. This would be the weakest UK growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2012.",

    "webTitle": "Panama Papers: US launches criminal inquiry into tax avoidance claims", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the widespread international tax avoidance schemes exposed by the Panama Papers leak, published by the Guardian and other journalistic partners. Preet Bharara, the US attorney for Manhattan, said he had \u201copened a criminal investigation regarding matters to which the Panama Papers are relevant\u201d. Bharara has written to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which coordinated the unprecedented leak of 11.5m files from offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca, to ask for further information to assist with his criminal investigation. The inquiry comes after Barack Obama described the revelations from the leaks \u2013 which have caused political tumult across the world \u2013 \u201cimportant stuff\u201d and global tax avoidance as a \u201chuge problem\u201d. \u201cThere is no doubt that the problem of global tax avoidance generally is a huge problem,\u201d Obama told reporters in an unscheduled appearance in the White House briefing room earlier this month. \u201cThe problem is that a lot of this stuff is legal, not illegal. \u201cA lot of these loopholes come at the expense of middle-class families, because that lost revenue has to be made up somewhere.\u201d The US president said the leak from Panama illustrated the scale of tax avoidance involving Fortune 500 companies and running into trillions of dollars worldwide. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t make it legal to engage in transactions just to avoid taxes,\u201d he added, praising instead \u201cthe basic principle of making sure everyone pays their fair share\u201d. The US attorney general\u2019s office was unable to provide any further details about the criminal investigation because it is ongoing. Bharara, who as US attorney general for the southern district of New York has led several crusades against criminal wrongdoing in the financial sector, is already investigating several of the more than 200 US citizens named in the papers. Among them is Wall Street financier Benjamin Wey, who has been charged with securities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy and money laundering for using family members to help him amass ownership of large blocks of stock in companies through so-called \u201creverse merger\u201d transactions between Chinese companies and US shell companies. He made tens of millions of dollars of illegal profit by manipulating the companies\u2019 stock prices, according to the indictment. The Panama Papers leak shows that Mossack Fonseca helped set up the offshore companies used in the stock manipulation. \u201cBen Wey fashioned himself a master of industry, but as alleged, he was merely a master of manipulation,\u201d Bharara said when he announced the indictment against Wey in September. Wey, the chief executive of New York Global Group, denies the charge. The release of the Panama Papers has sparked public outrage across the world, including the resignations of the the prime minister of Iceland and Spain\u2019s industry minister following revelations about their offshore tax arrangements. David Cameron, the British prime minister, has also been forced to defend his family\u2019s tax arrangements after disclosures about an offshore fund established by his late father. He also has taken the unprecedented step of publicly releasing details from his tax returns. The offices of Mossack Fonseca in Panama were raided by police officers last week on the orders of the country\u2019s attorney general in an attempt to \u201cestablish the use of the firm for illicit activities\u201d. Mossack Fonseca is the world\u2019s fourth biggest offshore law firm. It specialises in incorporating companies in offshore jurisdictions such as the British Virgin Islands. The leaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have warned that the industrial scale of international tax avoidance revealed by the Panama Papers represents a \u201cgreat concern\u201d for the global economy and is having a \u201ctremendously negative effect on our mission to end poverty\u201d. Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, said last week that the revelations that many of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful people are avoiding paying millions in taxes by hiding money from the taxman in offshore havens is a \u201cgreat, great concern\u201d and \u201cvery, very damaging\u201d to the bank\u2019s \u201cmission to end extreme poverty\u201d. \u201cWhen taxes are evaded, when state assets are taken and put into these havens, all of these things can have a tremendous negative effect on our mission to end poverty and boost prosperity,\u201d he said. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, said the world\u2019s financial regulators had long been \u201calarmed\u201d about Panama\u2019s lax approach to taxation and corruption but failed to take action. In her strongest comments yet addressing the scandal exposed by the Panama Papers, Lagarde said: \u201cIn the case of Panama there had been alert and alarm raised, but there had not been the level of implementation that was expected.\u201d She said the leak showed that \u201cthe [international tax] rules appear to be skewed towards\u201d the global rich. \u201cClearly what has resulted from the review of these Panama Papers indicates that however important [international tax rules to prevent] base erosion and profit shifting \u2026 it is unfinished business,\u201d she said in an opening address to the meeting.",

He made tens of millions of dollars of illegal profit by manipulating the companies\u2019 stock prices, according to the indictment.</p> <p>The Panama Papers leak shows that Mossack Fonseca helped set up the offshore companies used in the stock manipulation.</p> <p>\u201cBen Wey fashioned himself a master of industry, but as alleged, he was merely a master of manipulation,\u201d Bharara said when <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/benjamin-wey-founder-and-president-new-york-global-group-arrested-and-charged-manhattan\">he announced the indictment against Wey in September</a>. Wey, the chief executive of New York Global Group, denies the charge. </p> <p>The release of the Panama Papers has sparked public outrage across the world, including the resignations of the the prime minister of Iceland and Spain\u2019s industry minister following revelations about their offshore tax arrangements. </p> <p>David Cameron, the British prime minister, has also been forced to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/05/david-cameron-left-dangerously-exposed-by-panama-papers-fallout\">defend his family\u2019s tax arrangements</a> after disclosures about an offshore fund established by his late father. He also has taken the unprecedented step of publicly releasing details from his tax returns. </p> <p>The offices of Mossack Fonseca in Panama were raided by police officers last week on the orders of the country\u2019s attorney general in an attempt to \u201cestablish the use of the firm for illicit activities\u201d. </p> <p>Mossack Fonseca is the world\u2019s fourth biggest offshore law firm. It specialises in incorporating companies in offshore jurisdictions such as the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>The leaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have warned that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/08/fallout-from-panama-papers-revelations-so-far-country-by-country\">industrial scale of international tax avoidance</a> revealed by the Panama Papers represents a \u201cgreat concern\u201d for the global economy and is having a \u201ctremendously negative effect on our mission to end poverty\u201d.</p> <p>Jim Yong Kim, the president of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/worldbank\">World Bank</a>, said last week that the revelations that many of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful people are avoiding paying millions in taxes by hiding money from the taxman in offshore havens is a \u201cgreat, great concern\u201d and \u201cvery, very damaging\u201d to the bank\u2019s \u201cmission to end extreme poverty\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen taxes are evaded, when state assets are taken and put into these havens, all of these things can have a tremendous negative effect on our mission to end poverty and boost prosperity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, said the world\u2019s financial regulators had long been \u201calarmed\u201d about Panama\u2019s lax approach to taxation and corruption but failed to take action.<br></p> <p>In her strongest comments yet addressing the scandal exposed by the Panama Papers, Lagarde said: \u201cIn the case of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/panama\">Panama</a> there had been alert and alarm raised, but there had not been the level of implementation that was expected.\u201d</p> <p>She said the leak showed that \u201cthe [international tax] rules appear to be skewed towards\u201d the global rich. \u201cClearly what has resulted from the review of these Panama Papers indicates that however important [international tax rules to prevent] base erosion and profit shifting \u2026 it is unfinished business,\u201d she said in an opening address to the meeting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The last time MPs became interested in boardroom pay at public companies, the result was more than 12 months of intense debate that culminated in shareholders being given a binding vote from 2014. But, in practice, the supposedly binding ropes were tied only loosely. The votes happen only every three years \u2013 rather than annually as the then business secretary, Vince Cable, had originally proposed \u2013 and the binding element applies only to the setting of pay polices. Votes on the actual implementation of the policies continue to be advisory. That is why BP, for example, doesn\u2019t have to give a damn about last week\u2019s 59% rebellion against its pay report. The vote was of the advisory variety and boss Bob Dudley can keep his \u00a314m if he wishes. If, in practice, BP\u2019s remuneration chairwoman, Dame Ann Dowling, has to be thrown overboard to pacify the revolting shareholders, the oil company will have little difficulty in finding an equally tame replacement. But BP \u2013 and public companies in general \u2013 can\u2019t be surprised if MPs feel this is hardly true to the Cable philosophy that shareholders would be better police officers on pay if they were armed with extra powers. Rather, the BP case shows that the balance of power has barely shifted: brazen boards can still baffle their shareholders with complex pay structures and then pay perverse sums. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, was right to say last week that if the will of shareholders is ignored \u201cit will only be a matter of time before the government introduces tougher regulations on executive pay\u201d. As it happens, the energy committee decided on Tuesday not to summon BP directors to explain their thinking. But it was probably the wrong committee for the job anyway. There is nothing to stop a different set of MPs \u2013 the business bunch, for example \u2013 from investigating, especially if the BP revolt is mirrored elsewhere. That would be a welcome development. Cable\u2019s reforms were meant to settle the matter for a generation and quell public anger. Two years later, the same old problems have returned, and now the numbers are even bigger. Government\u2019s blurred nuclear vision remains despite Amber light Terrific news, it doesn\u2019t matter if EDF and the French government decide they can\u2019t afford to build Hinkley Point C, the enormous \u00a318bn nuclear project set for Somerset. We can cope even if construction starts and is then delayed, which given EDF\u2019s record with its European pressurised reactors (one is four years behind schedule, the other nine years) is not an academic consideration. The source of this confidence is the energy secretary, Amber Rudd, writing to the energy select committee. \u201cWe have arrangements in place to ensure that any potential delay or cancellation to the project does not pose a risk to security of supply for the UK,\u201d she said. \u201cI am clear that keeping the lights on is non-negotiable.\u201d What\u2019s more, Rudd is right to be confident. Hinkley, even if everything proceeds to plan, won\u2019t produce a single megawatt of power until 2025, which leaves time to put alternative arrangements in place. It takes about two years to chuck up a gas-fired power station, for example, and off-shore wind could also play a role. The chief difficulty, as analysts such as investment bank Jefferies\u2019 Peter Atherton always point out, would come in meeting the UK\u2019s targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. If most of the non-Hinkley nuclear stations in the planning pipeline went ahead, there would be a small problem; if the entire new-nuclear programme ground to a halt, the challenge would be more severe. Rudd makes a similar same point. Yet her letter triggers a sinking feeling. The main conclusion to be drawn is that, in theory, UK still has time to escape the economic insanity of Hinkley and put in place an alternative plan to address the 2030 targets while also keeping the lights on. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but it could be done. Instead, the government is obsessed with paying a sky-high price to an overstretched company that can\u2019t get its new technology to work. Commons veto on FCA pick is great but was no Osborne compromise A small but noteworthy advance for parliamentary democracy: from now on, the Commons can veto the chancellor\u2019s pick for the job of chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, has been lobbying for this change ever since Martin Wheatley\u2019s messy exit from the FCA last year. Wheatley was told by George Osborne that his contract would not be renewed, provoking fierce accusations of political meddling with an important City regulator. Andrew Bailey was eventually switched from Bank of England to fill the hole. The FCA job will now come with a renewable five-year contract and the Treasury committee will be able to force a vote in Commons on an appointment. As Tyrie says, parliament \u201cwill now be better placed to safeguard the FCA from interference \u2013 or the perception of interference \u2013 by the Treasury or Treasury ministers\u201d. Good. Only a cynic would suggest that Osborne agreed to this restraint because he\u2019ll never have to appoint another chief executive of the FCA.",

      "bodyText": "The revelations (Watchdog steps in after allegations Boots is milking NHS, 18 April) following the Guardian investigation into Boots are symptomatic of the dynamic between the NHS and private business, some of which could arguably be regarded as exploitation. In our case we have identified a conflict of interest around the private laboratories appointed to manage NHS microbiology contracts and the latter\u2019s urgent need to make significant cost savings in all areas of clinical medicine and patient experience. On approaching one of the largest of these private laboratory groups to promote improved urine specimen collection and dramatically reduce retesting, we were told that this \u201cwould knock about \u00a3500,000 off our bottom line\u201d. Our entreaty that right-first-time analysis, diagnosis and treatment would benefit patients as well as the NHS on a number of levels was dismissed in favour of shareholder interests. Those in the NHS responsible for setting up volume-based compensation to private companies have singularly failed to protect their employer from what could arguably be viewed as exploitation. There are some NHS laboratories whose budgets also rely on the volume processing of specimens, without any reward or incentive for reduction in retesting. This is a more serious issue than many will acknowledge given there are around 65m urine tests delivered to the NHS annually. Our own FOI research points to a national average potential retest rate of about 20% with some trusts showing 50% and in one case over 70%. That\u2019s an awful lot of patients who cannot be accurately diagnosed at first test, which might also suggest a reason behind the wide prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Giovanna Forte Founding director, Forte Medical, London \u2022 As a doctor and an NHS patient, I am disgusted by the corporate behaviour of Boots. This is obviously harmful to its staff and to public health and finances. On a personal note, I was recently asked to return to my local branch for a medicine use review (MUR) which I neither needed nor wanted. Being unaware that this waste of my time and that of the pharmacist was a rip-off designed to extort \u00a328 (for three minutes of unnecessary and somewhat embarrassed advice), I complied. I regret colluding inadvertently with this. Two years ago it was revealed that (as a result of takeover by the US giant Walgreens) Boots had arranged its tax affairs via Switzerland to ensure it cheated the UK exchequer out of more than \u00a31bn. This resulted in protests outside Boots branches by UK Uncut. In view of the Guardian\u2019s revelations, it is time to repeat those actions on a larger scale with an emphasis on solidarity with the staff. It is also time for the General Pharmaceutical Council and the health select committee to find out what incentives are imposed on Boots\u2019 local and regional managers to drive them and their staff to undertake unnecessary MURs to extract profits from the rest of us. Dr Frank Arnold Brighton \u2022 This story reflects the modern nature of commerce, with the government encouraging the involvement of big business \u201cfor economies\u201d of scale and then seeing vast tax revenue taken offshore. The pharmaceutical wholesale market is dominated by two players, is based outside the UK and could be classified ascalled \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. It is interesting to see the Department of Health in its latest stance against community pharmacy, wanting to close 3,000 pharmacies. This would affect the smaller independent pharmacies in order to save \u00a3170m but does little to address the loss of billions of tax revenue. Gursaran Singh Matharu Mapex Pharmacy Consultancy \u2022 Less obvious profiteering by Boots is instruction of their pharmacists on private prescriptions. I wrote one for a week\u2019s amoxicillin, knowing it to be cheaper than the NHS cost of \u00a38.40, and went to collect it for a patient. I was astonished to be told that all such items now cost the NHS price or higher. I went to Sainsbury\u2019s pharmacy and found it for \u00a34.45, which included the \u00a32-plus dispensing fee. JK Cruickshank Professor of cardiovascular medicine and diabetes; Hon consultant physician, St Thomas\u2019 &amp; Guy\u2019s hospitals, King\u2019s College and King\u2019s Health Partners, London \u2022 I can testify to the truth of the allegations against Boots regarding the abuse of medicine use reviews. A few months ago I was subjected to one without being asked if I wanted it. Indeed, it was conducted in the manner of a test of mental capacity (I am of an age to receive free prescriptions) and was continued against my will, it being alleged that I was on the wrong medication. The frustration of the pharmacist when I refused to sign a document whose use and nature were unknown to me, and have remained so until I read your report, was very ill-concealed, and complaints both to Boots and to my local medical practice produced no satisfactory explanation. Dear old \u201cBoots the chemist\u201d is no more; the corporate machine that has taken it over is ripe for a full investigation. Simon Nicholls London \u2022 The culture at Boots illustrates why the private sector, with its first duty to shareholders, has no place in the NHS.

In our case we have identified a conflict of interest around the private laboratories appointed to manage NHS microbiology contracts and the latter\u2019s urgent need to make significant cost savings in all areas of clinical medicine and patient experience.</p> <p>On approaching one of the largest of these private laboratory groups to promote improved urine specimen collection and dramatically reduce retesting, we were told that this \u201cwould knock about \u00a3500,000 off our bottom line\u201d. Our entreaty that right-first-time analysis, diagnosis and treatment would benefit patients as well as the NHS on a number of levels was dismissed in favour of shareholder interests.</p> <p>Those in the NHS responsible for setting up volume-based compensation to private companies have singularly failed to protect their employer from what could arguably be viewed as exploitation. There are some NHS laboratories whose budgets also rely on the volume processing of specimens, without any reward or incentive for reduction in retesting.</p> <p>This is a more serious issue than many will acknowledge given there are around 65m urine tests delivered to the NHS annually. Our own FOI research points to a national average potential retest rate of about 20% with some trusts showing 50% and in one case over 70%. That\u2019s an awful lot of patients who cannot be accurately diagnosed at first test, which might also suggest a reason behind the wide prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics.<br><strong>Giovanna Forte</strong><br><em>Founding director, Forte Medical, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a doctor and an NHS patient, I am disgusted by the corporate behaviour of Boots. This is obviously harmful to its staff and to public health and finances.</p> <p>On a personal note, I&#xa0;was recently asked to return to my local branch for a medicine use review (MUR) which I neither needed nor wanted. Being unaware that this waste of my time and that of the pharmacist was a rip-off designed to extort \u00a328 (for three minutes of unnecessary and somewhat embarrassed advice), I complied. I regret colluding inadvertently with this.</p> <p>Two years ago it was revealed that (as a result of takeover by the US giant Walgreens) Boots had arranged its tax affairs via Switzerland <a href=\"http://www.medact.org/medact-blog/tax-abuse-public-heath-risk-time-pay-boots/\" title=\"\">to ensure it cheated the UK exchequer out of more than \u00a31bn</a>. This resulted in protests outside Boots branches by UK Uncut. In view of the Guardian\u2019s revelations, it is time to repeat those actions on a larger scale with an emphasis on solidarity with the staff.</p> <p>It is also time for the General Pharmaceutical Council and the health select committee to find out what incentives are imposed on Boots\u2019 local and regional managers to drive them and their staff to undertake unnecessary MURs to extract profits from the rest of us.<br><strong>Dr Frank Arnold</strong><br><em>Brighton</em></p> <p>\u2022 This story reflects the modern nature of commerce, with the government encouraging the involvement of big business \u201cfor economies\u201d of scale and then seeing vast tax revenue taken offshore. The pharmaceutical wholesale market is dominated by two players, is based outside the UK and could be classified ascalled \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d.</p> <p>It is interesting to see the Department of Health in its latest stance against community pharmacy, wanting to close 3,000 pharmacies. This would affect the smaller independent pharmacies in order to save \u00a3170m but does little to address the loss of billions of tax revenue.<br><strong>Gursaran Singh Matharu</strong><br><em>Mapex Pharmacy Consultancy</em></p> <p>\u2022 Less obvious profiteering by Boots is instruction of their pharmacists on private prescriptions. I wrote one for a week\u2019s amoxicillin, knowing it to be cheaper than the NHS cost of \u00a38.40, and went to collect it for a patient. I was astonished to be told that all such items now cost the NHS price or higher. I went to Sainsbury\u2019s pharmacy and found it for \u00a34.45, which included the \u00a32-plus dispensing fee.<br><strong>JK Cruickshank</strong><br><em>Professor of cardiovascular medicine and diabetes; Hon consultant physician, St Thomas\u2019 &amp; Guy\u2019s hospitals, King\u2019s College and King\u2019s Health Partners, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I can testify to the truth of the allegations against Boots regarding the abuse of medicine use reviews. A few months ago I was subjected to one without being asked if I wanted it. Indeed, it was conducted in the manner of a test of mental capacity (I am of an age to receive free prescriptions) and was continued against my will, it being alleged that I was on the wrong medication. The frustration of the pharmacist when I refused to sign a document whose use and nature were unknown to me, and have remained so until I read your report, was very ill-concealed, and complaints both to Boots and to my local medical practice produced no satisfactory explanation. Dear old \u201cBoots the chemist\u201d is no more; the corporate machine that has taken it over is ripe for a full investigation.<br><strong>Simon Nicholls</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The culture at Boots illustrates why the&#xa0;private sector, with its first duty to shareholders, has no place in the NHS.<br><strong>Karen Fletcher</strong><br><em>Sheffield </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Peter Nelson, 56, recently signed on for the first time. A machinist at an engineering firm in Redcar, he was one of thousands who lost their jobs after the collapse of the town\u2019s steel industry. Clutching a list of vacancies outside the fourth jobs fair arranged to help those made redundant back into work, Nelson explains that he has applied for 100 jobs since losing his job three months ago. Struggling to contain his emotions, he says: \u201cI am very scared at the moment. My house will probably go up for sale.\u201d It\u2019s more than six months since Redcar\u2019s blast furnace went cold, drawing the curtain on a century of steelmaking in the town. The experience of the town since will make grim reading for the thousands of steelworkers in Port Talbot whose jobs are on the line. Despite a spirited local campaign to save the Redcar plant when owners SSI UK went into liquidation, and pleas to the government to step in and secure its short-term viability until a buyer could be found, at least 3,000 workers from the plant and the supply chain suddenly lost their jobs. As the head of the taskforce established to deal with the fallout put it, \u201csteel runs through the veins\u201d of people on Teesside, and the loss of identity is profound. And the seismic economic shock caused in the area, where similarly well-paid jobs are in short supply and the buoyancy of local businesses often relied on the steelworks, is only just beginning to be fully understood. The Redcar constituency experienced the second highest increase in unemployment in England last year \u2013 up 16.2%. Figures from the SSI taskforce say 1,384 workers have so far moved off benefits into full-time work or training \u2013 but no data yet exists on the split between the two. Nearly 700 are still claiming benefits, not including those who may have signed off and made a new claim since. Over 400 have made no claim at all. \u201cWe already had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country,\u201d said Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar. \u201cIt\u2019s not London, Manchester or Leeds or somewhere you can just absorb these jobs. This is a foundation industry, and the major employer in the region, and you can\u2019t just recreate and replace those jobs overnight, or suddenly expect people tobecome entrepreneurs.\u201d Former steelworkers have been turning up at foodbanks. The SSI fund, set up from \u00a350m of government money to administer training and support services, has made grants of more than \u00a3300,000 to help the most cash-strapped keep up to date with rent or mortgage payments, and even pay for food and heating. The SSI fund is also creating jobs and retraining ex-steelworkers. Schemes which subsidise employers taking on former steelworkers or assist firms in the supply chain have created or safeguarded 796 jobs, many in the area\u2019s chemicals industry, and in manufacturing and engineering. Retraining course places at local colleges have been granted in areas as diverse as health and safety, industrial robotics, offshore survival and various driving roles. Funding has also been doubled to help redundant steelworkers set up their own businesses. Seventy-one have so far been approved, with more likely to follow. Dan Wilcox, 53, was awarded \u00a310,000 to help establish an LGV driving instruction business, which now employs four other ex-steelworkers. He also teaches LGV classroom-based courses, which attracts scores of his ex-workmates. \u201cSome of these guys who had been in there for years, who had never done anything but be a steelworker, it was devastating for them. \u201cTheir chins are on the floor, they don\u2019t know where to turn, and it gives me immense pride and satisfaction when I see the lads who have already gone out now being retrained by us going back into work and bringing an income in.\u201d But tales of fruitless job searches and pared-down salaries are more commonplace. Mike Gilbert, 52, worked at the steelworks for 31 years. He has recently been employed as a trainee bus driver after months of searching for a job. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to sell our house. We just couldn\u2019t afford the mortgage,\u201d he said. His new salary is less than half the \u00a32,200 a month he earned at SSI. But it is typical of many of the jobs many steelworkers are now taking. Taking such big cuts in income is difficult, as Paul Warren, from the Community trade union, who sits on the SSI taskforce, explains. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many qualifications you needed to be a production steelworker but it was the job that you did. We were probably a bit unique in the area. A bit like the coalminers were in their day. Gritty, dirty, grimy, you got paid for what you did rather than what you know.\u201d He says whereas production operators would earn between \u00a330,000 and \u00a333,000 at the steelworks, similar labouring jobs elsewhere only offer \u00a316,000-22,000. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardship and what we have to adjust to. Some people are finding it difficult, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d Many others have been forced to move away to find work \u2013 some to London, Wales or even abroad. Jamie, 26, who spoke tothe Guardian during the closure process, is still out of work, despite applying for 50 jobs a week. He recently had an interview for a job in the nuclear industry in Peterborough, one of about 15 callbacks he has had, with only one in the north-east. As his family\u2019s main earner previously, with a disabled brother and a mother who has reduced her hours at work for health reasons, he too is feeling the financial pinch. \u201cThe mortgage is now in arrears, I\u2019ve probably got enough to pay my car this month and that\u2019s about it to be honest,\u201d he said. Amanda Skelton, the chief executive of Redcar and Cleveland borough council and chair of the SSI taskforce, says it is important to look forward. \u201cBut what we\u2019re trying to do at the taskforce is to focus on the future and to encourage people not to lose hope. We have got to strengthen and diversify our economy. We\u2019ve got to use this opportunity of having government support at the moment to make that happen so that we are more sustainable in the future.\u201d In addition to the funding for the SSI taskforce, the government appointed Lord Heseltine to chair an inward investment programme for Teesside, and a mayoral development corporation \u2013 the first of its kind outside London \u2013 will act as a vehicle to devolve regeneration and business support powers to the region and regenerate the steelworks site. Turley wants to find a future for the site, situated on prime industrial land next to a deepwater port, which she claims is costing \u00a3200,000 a month to maintain. \u201cIt\u2019s just tragic really to see the blast furnace standing over the town as a sort of sorry symbol of loss and decline and the sooner we can move to do something on that site to bring jobs and investment and hope the better. \u201cThe priority for me is it creates good, skilled, secure jobs, it\u2019s an industry for the future and it builds on our existing strengths, skills and heritage.\u201d",

My house will probably go up for sale.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s more than six months since Redcar\u2019s blast furnace went cold, drawing the curtain on a century of steelmaking in the town. The experience of the town since will make grim reading for the thousands of steelworkers in Port Talbot whose jobs are on the line.<br></p> <p>Despite a spirited local campaign to save the Redcar plant when owners <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/02/redcar-steel-plant-goes-into-liquidation\">SSI UK went into liquidation</a>, and pleas to the government to step in and secure its short-term viability until a buyer could be found, at least 3,000 workers from the plant and the supply chain suddenly lost their jobs. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/13/uk-steel-industry-tata-government-cost-communities\">The government must save UK steel \u2013 or pay the price for years to come | Deborah Orr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the head of the taskforce established to deal with the fallout put it, \u201csteel runs through the veins\u201d of people on Teesside, and the loss of identity is profound. And the seismic economic shock caused in the area, where similarly well-paid jobs are in short supply and the buoyancy of local businesses often relied on the steelworks, is only just beginning to be fully understood. <br></p> <p>The Redcar constituency experienced the <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7534/CBP-7534.pdf\">second highest increase in unemployment</a> in England last year \u2013 up 16.2%. Figures from the SSI taskforce say 1,384 workers have so far moved off benefits into full-time work or training \u2013 but no data yet exists on the split between the two. Nearly 700 are still claiming benefits, not including those who may have signed off and made a new claim since. Over 400 have made no claim at all. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe already had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country,\u201d said Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar. \u201cIt\u2019s not London, Manchester or Leeds or somewhere you can just absorb these jobs. This is a foundation industry, and the major employer in the region, and you can\u2019t just recreate and replace those jobs overnight, or suddenly expect people tobecome entrepreneurs.\u201d </p> <p>Former steelworkers have been turning up at foodbanks. The SSI fund, set up from \u00a350m of government money to administer training and support services, has made grants of more than \u00a3300,000 to help the most cash-strapped keep up to date with rent or mortgage payments, and even pay for food and heating. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cebf8df9e2c8ce628f49ad0df531f390260b6df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cebf8df9e2c8ce628f49ad0df531f390260b6df/0_156_3478_2087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man cleans the runners on the blast furnace at the SSI steel plant at Redcar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man cleans the runners on the blast furnace at the SSI steel plant at Redcar in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The SSI fund is also creating jobs and retraining ex-steelworkers. Schemes which subsidise employers taking on former steelworkers or assist firms in the supply chain have created or safeguarded 796 jobs, many in the area\u2019s chemicals industry, and in manufacturing and engineering. Retraining course places at local colleges have been granted in areas as diverse as health and safety, industrial robotics, offshore survival and various driving roles.</p> <p>Funding has also been doubled to help redundant steelworkers set up their own businesses. Seventy-one have so far been approved, with more likely to follow. </p> <p>Dan Wilcox, 53, was awarded \u00a310,000 to help establish an LGV driving instruction business, which now employs four other ex-steelworkers. He also teaches LGV classroom-based courses, which attracts scores of his ex-workmates. \u201cSome of these guys who had been in there for years, who had never done anything but be a steelworker, it was devastating for them. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s just tragic really to see the blast furnace standing over the town as a sort of sorry symbol of loss</p> <footer> <cite>Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTheir chins are on the floor, they don\u2019t know where to turn, and it gives me immense pride and satisfaction when I see the lads who have already gone out now being retrained by us going back into work and bringing an income in.\u201d</p> <p>But tales of fruitless job searches and pared-down salaries are more commonplace. Mike Gilbert, 52, worked at the steelworks for 31 years. He has recently been employed as a trainee bus driver after months of searching for a job. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to sell our house. We just couldn\u2019t afford the mortgage,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His new salary is less than half the \u00a32,200 a month he earned at SSI. But it is typical of many of the jobs many steelworkers are now taking. Taking such big cuts in income is difficult, as Paul Warren, from the Community trade union, who sits on the SSI taskforce, explains. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many qualifications you needed to be a production steelworker but it was the job that you did. </p> <p>We were probably a bit unique in the area. A bit like the coalminers were in their day. Gritty, dirty, grimy, you got paid for what you did rather than what you know.\u201d He says whereas production operators would earn between \u00a330,000 and \u00a333,000 at the steelworks, similar labouring jobs elsewhere only offer \u00a316,000-22,000. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardship and what we have to adjust to. Some people are finding it difficult, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d</p> <p>Many others have been forced to move away to find work \u2013 some to London, Wales or even abroad. Jamie, 26, who spoke tothe Guardian during the closure process, is still out of work, despite applying for 50 jobs a week. He recently had an interview for a job in the nuclear industry in Peterborough, one of about 15 callbacks he has had, with only one in the north-east.</p> <p>As his family\u2019s main earner previously, with a disabled brother and a mother who has reduced her hours at work for health reasons, he too is feeling the financial pinch. \u201cThe mortgage is now in arrears, I\u2019ve probably got enough to pay my car this month and that\u2019s about it to be honest,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Amanda Skelton, the chief executive of Redcar and Cleveland borough council and chair of the SSI taskforce, says it is important to look forward. \u201cBut what we\u2019re trying to do at the taskforce is to focus on the future and to encourage people not to lose hope. We have got to strengthen and diversify our economy. We\u2019ve got to use this opportunity of having government support at the moment to make that happen so that we are more sustainable in the future.\u201d </p> <p>In addition to the funding for the SSI taskforce, the government appointed Lord Heseltine to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/heseltine-appointed-to-lead-tees-valley-investment-programme\">chair an inward investment programme</a> for Teesside, and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/19/heseltine-regenerate-redcar-steelworks-site-jobs\">mayoral development corporation</a> \u2013 the first of its kind outside London \u2013 will act as a vehicle to devolve regeneration and business support powers to the region and regenerate the steelworks site. </p> <p>Turley wants to find a future for the site, situated on prime industrial land next to a deepwater port, which she claims is costing \u00a3200,000 a month to maintain. \u201cIt\u2019s just tragic really to see the blast furnace standing over the town as a sort of sorry symbol of loss and decline and the sooner we can move to do something on that site to bring jobs and investment and hope the better.</p> <p>\u201cThe priority for me is it creates good, skilled, secure jobs, it\u2019s an industry for the future and it builds on our existing strengths, skills and heritage.\u201d</p>",

Sales at the sandwich chain rose 13.9% to \u00a3676.2m in the year to December, with receipts at branches open a year or more up 7.5%. Profits before interest, tax and other items increased 14.5% to \u00a384.3m. Sales of vegetarian options grew by double-digits and Pret highlighted that it sold 17,000 each week of a new beetroot, squash and feta salad, outstripping chicken and salmon options. Avocados, in favour with health-conscious foodies, were the chain\u2019s fastest-growing ingredient. Sales of Pret lines containing avocado rose by more than a quarter \u2013 26% \u2013 with customers consuming 5m of them in salads and sandwiches last year. Clive Schlee, Pret\u2019s chief executive, said the chain was particularly well-placed to take advantage of the fruit\u2019s popularity as it made all its products in or very near its branches every morning, instead of in large remote factories. \u201cOthers can\u2019t use them as well as we can because they go brown,\u201d he said. The 30-year-old company was founded by the entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe, who went on to create the Itsu restaurant chain and Metcalfe\u2019s Skinny popcorn. It will convert a branch in Soho, London, into a vegetarian-only outlet for six weeks and branches will sell two vegetarian special options each month over the summer. Schlee said the plans for the no-meat outlet had spurred Pret\u2019s chefs to come up with dozens more ideas, some of which could then be brought into the main chain. He said thousands of customers had told the company they were trying to eat less meat and almost 10,000 customers voted on social media on options for improving the chain\u2019s vegetarian range. \u201cPeople are thinking carefully about what lands in their stomach when they are eating and they are looking at vegetarian food,\u201d he said. \u201cMy theory is that we would all eat more vegetarian food if it was more readily available, more colourful and a better texture. For so long it has been the poor cousin and we are trying to bring it up to the rest of the family.\u201d Sales at Pret\u2019s US operation, launched in 2001, rose 13.8% at established stores \u2013 the chain\u2019s fastest growing market. New products and larger stores to suit American tastes helped sales in the country, where Pret has 65 branches. The privately owned chain, which started as a single shop in Victoria in London, opened 36 new branches worldwide last year, taking the total to 399, and made more additions this year such as a shop in Dubai international airport. Schlee said sales had also been helped by good customer service, fostered by taking care of staff. \u201cOne of our core values is happy teams mean happy customers,\u201d said Schlee. He added that Pret had raised wages to maintain the business\u2019s differential above the \u201cnational living wage\u201d for over-25s introduced by the government this month. Staff earn \u00a37.50 an hour in London and can earn a \u00a31 an hour bonus if they meet customer service criteria checked by mystery shoppers. Workers who put in a full day\u2019s shift also get two free meals. Schlee said the package was helping Pret stand out from rivals such as Caffe Nero and Eat, both of which have recently been criticised for cutting back on staff benefits. \u201cWe are now finding it easier to recruit people,\u201d he said. Pret expects to open 10 more US stores this year, including a second outlet at Penn station. The chain\u2019s newly opened first store at the busy New York hub has the highest sales a square foot of any Pret in the world. The group also opened sites at Paris-Gare de Lyon as well as Nice airport. Up to six more outlets are to open in France and three more in Hong Kong. The majority of Pret\u2019s 303 UK stores are in London. The company expects to open about 30 stores in the UK this year, up from 23 last year, 12 of which were outside London. There are also plans to begin serving evening food, including alcohol, at two or three more outlets next month after trials at one central London store last year. Pret figures at a glance 5m Number of avocados used by the chain last year. 26% Rise in sales of products containing avocado. 1m Number of free coffees given away to customers last year. 73,000 The number of chicken caesar &amp; bacon baguettes \u2013Pret\u2019s most popular sandwich \u2013 sold a week in the UK. 1.5m Number of coffees its sells in a week worldwide. 401 Number of shops it has now.",

      "bodyText": "As oil prices continued to climb, as the strike in Kuwait outweighed concerns that the weekend meeting of producers failed to agree a cap on output, stock markets moved sharply higher once more. Commodity companies were among the leading risers, and positive results from the likes of L\u2019Oreal also helped sentiment. Silver soared as Chinese buyers moved in, dragging gold along with it. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: Gold\u2019s rally this year is finally feeding through to silver, which jumped to a 10-month high today. It\u2019s partly a correction in the usual gold-silver trading ratio, as silver has been lagging gold a bit this year and investors feel it needs to catch up. This could be a trend that continues. Longer term silver ought to outperform gold through better fundamentals as it has more industrial uses. The FTSE 100 hit a new fourth month high, reaching its best level since early December, while the MSCI All World index hit a similar peak. French and German markets remained strong, despite some less convincing gains on Wall Street. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 51.83 points or 0.82% at 6405.35 Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 2.27% to 10,349.59 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.32% higher at 4566.48 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.49% to 18,447.98 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.01% better at 8971.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.78% to 578.85 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 23 points or 0.13% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 2.54% at $44 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. To sum up, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned in a Lords committee that leaving the EU could lead to lower economic growth. He defended the Bank commenting on the referendum, saying it was its duty to weigh up the implications of Britain\u2019s membership, but that did not mean it was getting involved in politics. He said UK interest rates could get closer to zero, but said he had no appetite for negative rates. He played down fears of a new round of complex financial instruments similar to those which caused the crash, but said the bank continued to monitor the risks. [And not everything on the original topics for discussion appeared to come up.....] And with that the session ends. Q: How will you pursue climate change agenda [after Paris agreement]? The most important aspect for the Bank is we are regulator of insurance, re-insurance sector. Climate change is one of most important things they have to manage, and they do it well. As regulator, we have to make sure they are on top of it. The bigger risk for financial system is the transition of regulatory environment to move to low carbon environment, and whether it is smooth or abrupt. We will not tell banks to have larger capital requirements if you lend to a larger carbon emitter, we will not put price on carbon. But if there is a prospect of meeting Paris agreement, there will be an adjustment for businesses. The basis point is there needs to be a market in transitions, appropriate disclosure by companies what there strategy is and what their carbon footprint is. Whatever your view, we are agnostic, but you can\u2019t express those views across broader financial world because you don\u2019t have the information Q: How high could interest rates go without doing damage? We do surveys on this. The good news is indebtedness is down. It would have an impact, it\u2019s been a long time since interest rates have moved up. But the position has undoubtedly improved. And when banks are making mortgage decisions, they have affordability tests, including if interest rates go up. Q: Any forward guidance on when we\u2019ll hit 2%? No. [laughs] Q: On the housing market, lenders are edging up to higher loan to value lending, are you still concerned about housing market. The indebtedness of British households has gone down but it still high. It is one of the major risks we watch at MPC, and we watch higher loan to value. Q: what is the risk of house prices coming down in London. We don\u2019t look at housing prices, we look at indebtedness, says Carney. At the higher end [of the London housing market] there has been a move, in terms of negative interest [in property], which could feed through to prices. But I [repeat] there is a degree of uncertainty ahead of EU vote. On productivity Carney says a lack of confidence in future growth is an increasing drag on productivity and investment in the UK and other major countries. Q: Are economic statistics fit for purpose? I commend Charlie Beans review of ONS. It addresses a number of everyday issues where ONS could improve. We work closely with ONS. The most interesting thing of the review is where it draws attention to the undermeasurement of the digital economy. 30 basis points of growth could be missed because of mismeasurement. One of the components of the report is to give ONS greater access to the data we have, subject to confidentiality. Q: So is the CPI an accurate reflection of inflation? We had concerns of move to CPIH, housing move, because we had concerns about rental market. We have to continue to update the inflation basket, he says, but we do have confidence CPI is representative of inflation facing British households. Q: Hasn\u2019t QE caused some of these problems? Is there a danger you will move bubbles elsewhere? This economy has needed monetary stimulus for some time, since the crisis, says Carney. The degree of stimulus has often been less than it appeared; relative to where interest rates needed to go, stimulus has been modest. [With low interest rates] this is an environment where risk can build, in housing market, in infrastructure. We have to act to take out risk where we can. On buy to let, we decided not to take additional action. Tax changes have been considerable, and we want to see how that plays out. These risks build up, we have to be nimble about them. Q: Before the crash banks were issuing very complex instruments. Are you concerned there are trillions of dollars worth of very similar instruments backed by corporate loans in last few years? Instruments which were most problematic were securitisations of securitisations, Carney says. Single securitisation is a reasonable financial instrument But any time something in finance grows rapidly, we should look at it. That\u2019s why we are looking at buy to let because its growing rapidly. Are you confident its not a repeat [of previous problems]? More likely to relate to underlying creditworthiness of issuing entities. Q: Your predecessor said regulation has become too complex. It has become enormous, what is your view. UK is one of most advanced economies in world, a highly complex economy. This isn\u2019t a simple world of barter and agrarian economies, and we shouldn\u2019t go back to that. Banks need to perform functions [which are complex]. The question with regulation whether we blend it with simpler cross checks and take out complexity where we can and with judgement [rather than box ticking]. Part of this process of addressing too complex to fail, is about making sure the institution itself is resolvable - ringfencing is one example. Q: So does regulation make common sense? The common sense elements are the decisive elements. There are some unhelpful and complex regulations, but we have to strip them out. Question: What challenges to financial stability do you see from integration of euro area? What is your assessment of negative interest rates? What do you think of helicopter money? There is a risk is that the process of deepening integration [could] restrict our ability to do our job and deliver financial stability. Crucial to recognise this is a multi-currency union, there must be different degrees of integration, national authorities must have flexibility. We think we could move base rate closer to zero but have not said we have an appetite for negative interest rates. I am not a believer in concept of helicopter money. In effect a central bank cancels debt that is purchased [from government], it puts a hole in its bank sheet. Government never has to recapitalise bank. We create a fundamental problem with reserves on which we have to pay interest, which is not a problem when rates are low, but becomes one when take away stimulus. We do not have an asset on the other side, you end up with a compounded ponzi scheme. Q: are you saying London would be less dominant financial centre if we left the EU. Depends on the negotiations, says Carney, but it is less likely London would remain as a pre-eminent financial centre [if UK left]. City of London unlikely to be enhanced [by Brexit]. Q: Do you agree with Chancellor that Brexit would lead to higher mortgages? Did he consult with Bank? Chancellor did not consult, he is not a member of the MPC, says Carney. There are scenarios where we could have lower GDP and higher inflation, which has implications in terms of higher bank rate, he says. A second factor is bank funding costs, which are passed on to consumers. Risk premium could increase after vote, he says, which would increase funding costs. So two factors which could have an effect and point in the direction of higher mortgage rates. Question: you said Chinese slowdown was greater risk to economy than EU referendum. Still agree? Yes, in medium term the issues are considerable, it depends how they are handled by Chinese authorities. Question: having a complicated financial system is inviting problems, but there is no real attempt to reduce complexity, is there? There are a series of reforms that have sought to reduce complexity, including ringfencing banking, says Carney. With Lehman and Bear Stearns it was not clear how they were linked, Carney indicates. Settling trades through central counterparties helps [with clarity]. On migration, Carney says that older workers staying longer in the workforce has swamped the effect of higher migration to the the UK. Net migration was likely to become more important as the effect of the increase in older workers is exhausted. The effects of migration on wage levels are not material for the Bank of England. More Carney on the uncertainties around the referendum: We will comment on these risks when we have a policy meeting and they come up, but we will not comment through the purdah period of the EU referendum campaign. A reminder: more on Carney\u2019s EU comments in the politics live blog: Carney says there is no intention for the Bank to provide a commentary on that or any other EU analysis. Lord Hollick asks his view on Monday\u2019s Treasury assessment. Carney says it is an analysis of a specific event rather than a Bank economic forecast. The Bank did not take part and it is up to the Treasury to discuss the analysis. But it is a sound analysis, the broad approach makes sense. Carney: Whatever the outcome of the Referendum, the MPC would use its tools to achieve its inflation remit, and, more broadly, the Bank\u2019s policy committees will work in concert, as One Bank, to promote monetary and financial stability. On the EU referendum, Carney says the Bank has not made and will not make any overall assessment of the economics of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. But he added: At the same time, the Bank must assess the implications of the UK\u2019s EU membership for our ability to achieve our core objectives of maintaining monetary and financial stability. The Bank has a duty to report our evidence-based judgments to Parliament and to the public. That is the fundamental standard of an open and transparent central bank. Assessing and reporting major risks does not mean becoming involved in politics; rather it would be political to suppress important judgments which relate directly to the Bank\u2019s remits and which influence our policy actions. These policy actions include developing, and if necessary implementing, contingency plans. As with the Scottish Referendum, we will communicate as much as is prudent about those plans in advance of any risk materialising and as comprehensively as possible once risks have dissipated. The Bank published a detailed, comprehensive report last year which reviewed the how EU membership affects the Bank of England\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives. And he added that there are risks: Some elements of these risks may be beginning to manifest. Since November, the trade-weighted value of sterling has fallen 10%, with more than half of that occurring since the MPC\u2019s last forecast in February. The cost of buying protection against a marked depreciation of sterling has risen notably, with sterling risk reversals falling to their lowest level in over a decade. He added: A vote to leave the EU might result in an extended period of uncertainty about the economic outlook, including about the prospects for export growth. This uncertainty would be likely to push down on demand in the short run. Carney is talking about the housing market, and says growth in mortgage lending is driven solely by the buy to let market. He said: Buy-to-let mortgages increased by 11.5% last year and now account for 17% of the stock of total secured lending, twice the proportion of a decade ago. The PRA has just reviewed the plans of the 31 top lenders in the industry, representing over 90% of total buy-to-let lending. The Review revealed that some banks were applying weaker standards and highlighted the risk that more might do so to meet aggressive growth plans. In response, the PRA has clarified its expectations for buy-to-let underwriting standards and introduced new guidelines for minimum stressed interest rates to be used when lenders test affordability. Given the combination of this prudent reinforcement of underwriting standards and major tax changes now coming into force, the FPC has decided to take no further action at this stage but will continue to monitor potential threats to financial stability from buy-to-let. The session is underway. My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be following Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s comments on Brexit at the Lords committee in the politics live blog: Carney\u2019s appearance before the Lords can be seen live here. Mark Carney is up before the House of Lords economic affairs committee this afternoon in its annual meeting with the Bank of England governor. Here\u2019s a quick look at what is expected to be on the agenda: US markets have made a mixed start in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 31 points or 0.18% following the positive lead from Europe and Asia. But Nasdaq has dipped 21 points or 0.47%. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs, which has just reported a drop in revenues and earnings, is up nearly 1%. Gold and silver continue to gain ground, mainly driven by a weak dollar and Chinese buying. Gold is up 2% to a one week high of $1255 an ounce while silver - the main beneficiary of Chinese demand - has jumped 5% to a ten month high of $17.07 an ounce. US housing has been one of the stronger areas of the economy, so a downturn in March raises some questions, says Rob Carnell of ING: With talk of recession in the US economy beginning to gain traction again ahead of what will probably be a very weak first quarter GDP release next week (just after the April Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee meeting), we are looking for evidence on either side of the argument to help us update our forecasts and confirm or deny the recession argument. We feel the evidence for recession is quite circumstantial, with both weak and strong patches within the US economy. But one of those stronger patches has been the US home building sector, and this has taken a big dent in March. Housing starts fell by 8.8% month on month in March, with permits falling 7.7% month on month. Both single family and multifamily home starts were down sharply, though thanks to strong growth in January and February, this will merely dampen the boost to first quarter GDP growth from residential construction, not overturn it. But with permits providing a forward indication for weak second quarter residential construction, our conviction that what we are seeing is just one of the usual soft-patches in US data, not anything more alarming, is coming under pressure. We have been consistently below the recently cut consensus forecasts for US GDP growth (2.0% for 2016) and remain so even now (ING forcast 1.9%for 2016). But the likelihood of a really weak first quarter 2016 GDP forecast means that we will almost inevitably have to trim our figures further. Something closer to 1.5% for the full-year would be more consistent with the sorts of numbers published for first quarter GDP by the NowCasters, even assuming a recovery to the 2-2.5% range for the rest of the year. Argentina is about to make a triumphant return to the bond markets, 15 years after defaulting on its debts. After being swamped with interest, Buenos Aires has bumped up its new sale of three, five, 10 and 30-year bonds. It initially planned to raise $15bn, but is now going to sell $16.5bn of debt after receiving $65bn of bids from investors hungry for returns. It\u2019s a victory for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has worked hard to reach a deal with the country\u2019s lenders - such as vulture funds who bought Argentinian debt after its defaulted. Cutting a deal with such predatory investors can\u2019t be pleasant, but it does allow Argentina to borrow from the markets again. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investment, argues it\u2019s an important development: \u201cThe success of the issue is seen as an endorsement of new president Macri, as it is a huge step forwards with regards to improving Argentina\u2019s financial credibility.\u201d Oh dear. The number of new US house-building projects fell by almost 9% in March, new data shows. Residential housing starts decreased 8.8% to an annual rate of 1.09 million, the lowest since October, according to the Commerce Department. And the number of permits to build a new house also fell, by almost 8%, suggesting America\u2019s construction sector suffered falling demand last month. Traders are selling the US dollar as a result, on the grounds that an early US interest rate rise is less likely. The last three months certainly weren\u2019t a vintage quarter for Goldman Sachs: Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, says the last three months have been pretty tough. He told shareholders that profits fell over 50% because: \u201cThe operating environment this quarter presented a broad range of challenges, resulting in headwinds across virtually every one of our businesses. \u201cLooking ahead, we will continue to focus on delivering superior service to our clients and managing our business efficiently, which remain essential to generating shareholder value over the long term.\u201d Those \u201cchallenges\u201d includes a drop-off in deal-making (bad for investment bankers), and less demand for share trading from clients due to recent economic uncertainty. This is the fourth consecutive quarterly fall in Goldman\u2019s profits, as its bond traders and investment bankers suffer from tough market conditions. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Goldman Sachs\u2019 big fall in revenues and profits in the last quarter. https://twitter.com/MattCampbel/status/722390203634159616 Here come Goldman Sachs\u2019 financial results for the last quarter! Goldman has post a big drop in revenues, down from $10.6bn last year to $6.34bn. That\u2019s weaker than the $6.73bn which analysts had expected. And earnings have more than halved during the quarter, at $2.68 per share compared to $5.94 per share in January-March 2015. That beats expectations of $2.45 per share. Goldmand\u2019s income from investment banking income fell by almost a quarter, to $1.46bn. Equities trading suffered a similar decline, to $1.78bn. And CEO Lloyd Blankfein is blunt about market conditions, given market volatility and the lack of big merger deals. Blankfein says Goldman faced a \u201cbroad range of challenges\u201d, with headwinds in almost every one of its business areas. Global stock markets have hit their highest level since last December. The rally in Europe and Asia today, and on Wall Street last night, has pushed MSCI\u2019s All-Country World Stocks index to a four-month high. It\u2019s gained around 12% since early February, when investors were panicking about the slowdown in China and the stability of some European banks. Quite a turnaround, and vindication for those commentators who argued that shareholders should sit tight. The European Commission is gearing up to hit Google with fresh anti-competitive charges, over its Android mobile phone operating system, it appears. The word in Brussels is that European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could unveil formal antitrust charges on Wednesday. She\u2019s likely to accuse Google of abusing Android\u2019s dominance to give its own apps an unfair advantage against rivals. The case could echo the clashes with Microsoft more than a decade ago, when Brussels took issue with the software giant\u2019s domination of the desktop PC business. The German stock market is roaring ahead today, jumping by 220 point or 2.2%. Traders in Frankfurt were spurred into action by this morning\u2019s ZEW index, showing a leap in German economic confidence. German manufacturers are leading the rally, such as skincarer maker Beiersdorf (+3.8%), chipmaker Infineon Technologies (+3.3%), and chemicals firm BASF (+2.6%). And Europe\u2019s rally is likely to feed through to New York in a few hours time, potentially pushing the Dow Jones index to a new nine-month high. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the morning: Doha what? After Monday\u2019s rather tentative trading following the lack of oil action over the weekend the markets have leapt into life this Tuesday, hitting a bevy of fresh highs in the process. The main thrust of the morning\u2019s growth came from the Eurozone, the catalyst for this surge being the day\u2019s ZEW economic sentiment figures. With the German number coming in at 11.2 (against 8.2 expected and 4.3 last month) and the region-wide data at 21.5 (vastly higher than the 13.9 forecast and the 10.6 seen last month) confidence is picking up, despite the very real threat of a Brexit AND a worsening assessment of the German economy. This was the green light the DAX needed to roar in to life, jumping by over 200 points to 10350, within a 150 leap away from a fresh 2016 peak. Greece\u2019s government is resuming talks with its lenders this afternoon over its economic reforms, as the Greek debt crisis threatens to heat up. It\u2019s the first meeting since the International Monetary Fund pushed for Greece\u2019s bailout to be rewritten, to remove unachievable fiscal targets. Greece hasn\u2019t yet convinced its creditors that it has done enough to quality for debt relief, as they wrangle over bad debt rules and pension reforms. The creditors are understood to be pushing for Greece to sign up to extra austerity, in case the bailout programme goes off course. The Wall Street Journal explains: The package would be triggered only if Greece falls short of targets over the next three years. But the proposals, which come on top of a list of austerity measures already being negotiated, would have to be passed into law now\u2014posing a stiff test for the governing coalition of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, which has a majority of only three seats in parliament. Economic expectations in German has smashed forecasts, despite worries about Britain\u2019s EU referendum. The ZEW Institute\u2019s German economic sentiment index has surged to 11.2 this month, up from just 4.3 in March. Analysts had expected economic expectations (or Konjunkturerwartungen) to rise to 8. ZEW says recent \u201csurprisingly positive economic news\u201d from China has given investors more confidence about future prospects [Chinese exports surged in February, while the economy grew by a decent 6.7% in the last quarter]. However, German investors are less optimistic about their domestic economy. ZEW says: The assessment of the economic situation in Germany worsened. The index has fallen by 3.0 points and now stands at 47.7 points. And ZEW\u2019s Professor Dr. Sascha Steffen remains cautious, especially with Britain\u2019s Brexit referendum looming. The bottom line, however, the continuing weak growth in China and other key emerging markets remain a burden on the German export industry. The concern about a possible withdrawal from the EU Britain is likely to affect burdensome.\u201d Niels Christensen, foreign exchange strategist at Nordea, says the recovery in oil has sent confidence gushing through the markets: He says (via Reuters) \u201cIt is quite amazing how oil prices have recovered from Monday\u2019s lows. That is shoring up risk appetite and pushing up commodity-linked currencies. \u201cAs long as oil remains above $43 a barrel we think commodity currencies will remain supported.\u201d Brent is currently trading at $43.24 per barrel.... That \u2018party on, dudes\u2019 feeling has driven European stock markets to three-month highs. Consumer goods firms are leading the way after France\u2019s L\u2019Oreal posted solid sales and profit figures this morning. Miners are also up, reflecting the weaker US dollar, while banks are benefitting from more optimism about emerging market economies. This has sent the Stoxx 600 index, the broad measure of European shares, to its highest level since January. And the FTSE 100 is still at its highest level since December, as the City shows some sunny optimism. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains why: \u201cEquity markets are handsomely positive this morning, still benefiting from the oil price rebound as supply disruption from a Kuwaiti strike helps offsets the (misplaced) weekend disappointment from Doha. A weak US dollar following dovish Fed commentary is also keeping commodities and their miners bid while a Dow Jones back at 9-month highs 18,000 and a decent US earnings season so far is maintaining risk appetite. Equities continue to extend their gains from 2016 lows taking headwinds in the stride and preferring to focus on the positives. The workers\u2019 strike that has halved Kuwait\u2019s oil output looks terribly civilised, judging by these photos from Sunday: The oil workers are protesting against cuts to pay and benefits, which Kuwait is enforcing after the slump in oil revenues played havoc with its budget. The Kuwaiti government has urged workers to return to duty, and threatened legal action against the \u201cinstigators\u201d of the walkout. But analysts predict that a compromise will be found. Consultancy group Eurasia says: \u201cSensitive to union pressure, the government is likely to compromise on most of striking oil workers\u2019 pay demands. In the coming days oil production is likely to partially recover from its initial drop as non-striking staff is redistributed and inventories drawn upon. Two of Europe\u2019s better known lager brands are changing hands, as part of the latest mega-deal in the brewing industry. Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev is selling Peroni and Grolsch to Japan\u2019s Asahi (the firm behind Super Dry beer), to help smooth its takeover of SAB Miller. London craft brewer Meantime is also being sold to Asahi, less than a year after SAB snapped up the fast-growing company... More here: Sterling crisis, what sterling crisis? The pound has gained almost half a cent this morning to $1.4319, a one-week high. This follows a new opinion poll, giving the Remain campaign a nine point lead in June\u2019s in-out EU referendum. It\u2019s a telephone poll too, which are seen as more accurate (or possibly \u2018less inaccurate\u2019 would be safer) The FTSE 100 has just hit its highest level of the year, up 42 points at 6395. Precious metal prices are rising this morning too. Gold has gained 1% to $1,246 per ounce, while silver has jumped by 3% to a 10-month high. Again, that\u2019s partly due to the weakening US dollar. It has lost ground against most commodity-linked currencies today, reflecting the recovery in the oil price. European stock markets are rising at the start of trading, following Asia\u2019s lead. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 23 points, or 0.4%, to 6377 points. Mining stocks are packing the list of top risers, with Anglo American up 4% and Fresnillo and Glencore both gaining 3%. That\u2019s partly because the US dollar is weaker this morning, which pushes up commodity prices. Investors are also welcoming today\u2019s recovery in the oil price, as Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale explains: Brent crude at $40 per baarrel has done a good job of rejecting the notion that without production cuts it\u2019s going to hell in a hand basket. Unless we can un-invent the technology gains of the last few years we won\u2019t see dramatic upside and if the upshot is that oil prices settle into a range and better still, the correlation between non oil-producing countries currencies and the price of oil falls away, then that\u2019s even better. In the meantime, the oil market\u2019s willingness to get back to business as usual has been greeted by a loud cry of \u2018Party On, Dudes\u2019 in equity markets. An \u2018excellent\u2019 film reference from Kit... Yesterday\u2019s oil price slide has been completely wiped out: The recovery in the oil price has helped to drive stock markets higher in Asia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the way with a 3.7% rally, helped by the yen weakening against the US dollar (good news for Japanese exporters). That wipes out yesterday\u2019s selloff, when investors sold heavily following the huge earthquakes that killed at least 42 people and shuttered factories. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/500 index gained 1%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng finished 0.8% higher, and there were small gains in Shanghai too. This pushed the MSCI index of Asian markets to its highest level since last November. Asian investors were also cheered by the sight of the US stock market rallying last night. Hiroki Allen, of Superfund Securities Japan says: \u201cThe effects of the Dow reaching a nine-month high created a buying trend that helped lift the Nikkei today.\u201d The oil price is rallying this morning as world markets put the debacle of Sunday\u2019s Opec meeting behind them. Brent crude has risen to $43.23, up 0.75%, adding to last night\u2019s late rally. US crude oil is up almost 1%, back over $40. The rally appears to be driven by industrial action in Kuwait, where oil workers have been on strike since Sunday in a protest against public sector reforms which will cut their earnings. The walkout has slashed Kuwait\u2019s output by 60%, or 1.7 million barrels per day -- effectively eliminating the surplus crude in world markets. This has taken traders\u2019 minds off the deadlock between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which scuppered attempts to freeze output last weekend. Ironically, Kuwait\u2019s oil workers have done what the oil ministers and governors of Opec failed to achieve. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we get a new healthcheck on economic confidence in Europe\u2019s largest economy, and hear from the UK\u2019s top central banker. Germany ZEW index, released at 10am BST, is expected to show that economic sentiment among German investors and analysts rose this month, following the recent recovery in the markets. That will help set the scene for the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, will give his own view of the general economic outlook this afternoon. He\u2019s testifying to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee from 3.30pm. On the agenda: China\u2019s econony, the risks posed by Britain\u2019s EU referendum, and the revelations in the Panama Papers. On the corporate front, we\u2019ll get results from Goldman Sachs at 12.30pm BST. The Wall Street titan is tipped to post lower revenues and profits, as IB Times explains: The bank, which recently agreed to pay out over $5 billion to settle allegations related to the sale of subprime mortgage to investors between 2005 and 2007, is also forecast to report a 36.6 percent year-on-year drop in revenue, to $6.73 billion in the first three months of 2016 from $10.6 billion. Goldman\u2019s pretax profit is also expected to take a hit and is likely to drop to $1.87 billion from $3.93 billion in the first quarter of 2015. We also get some new US construction data at 1.30pm. That\u2019ll show how many new housing permits were granted last month, and how many actually started being built. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

downturn in March raises some questions, says Rob Carnell of ING:</p> <blockquote> <p>With talk of recession in the US economy beginning to gain traction again ahead of what will probably be a very weak first quarter GDP release next week (just after the April Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee meeting), we are looking for evidence on either side of the argument to help us update our forecasts and confirm or deny the recession argument.</p> <p>We feel the evidence for recession is quite circumstantial, with both weak and strong patches within the US economy. But one of those stronger patches has been the US home building sector, and this has taken a big dent in March. </p> <p>Housing starts fell by 8.8% month on month in March, with permits falling 7.7% month on month. Both single family and multifamily home starts were down sharply, though thanks to strong growth in January and February, this will merely dampen the boost to first quarter GDP growth from residential construction, not overturn it.</p> <p>But with permits providing a forward indication for weak second quarter residential construction, our conviction that what we are seeing is just one of the usual soft-patches in US data, not anything more alarming, is coming under pressure.</p> <p>We have been consistently below the recently cut consensus forecasts for US GDP growth (2.0% for 2016) and remain so even now (ING forcast 1.9%for 2016). But the likelihood of a really weak first quarter 2016 GDP forecast means that we will almost inevitably have to trim our figures further. Something closer to 1.5% for the full-year would be more consistent with the sorts of numbers published for first quarter GDP by the NowCasters, even assuming a recovery to the 2-2.5% range for the rest of the year. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5716299de4b057c2bbe00b2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T13:07:43.877Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"48de6419de9c55feb4f546d1e3d873da494252b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48de6419de9c55feb4f546d1e3d873da494252b2/0_0_2000_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Argentina flag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Argentina is about to make a triumphant return to the bond markets, 15 years after defaulting on its debts.</strong></p> <p>After being swamped with interest, Buenos Aires has bumped up its new sale of three, five, 10 and 30-year bonds. </p> <p>It initially planned to raise $15bn, but is now going to sell<strong> $16.5bn</strong> of debt after receiving $65bn of bids from investors hungry for returns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BTabrum/status/722406306565472256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That Argentine deal &#39;capped at $15bn&#39; is in fact going to be $16.5bn</p>&mdash; Burnett Tabrum (@BTabrum) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BTabrum/status/722406306565472256\">April 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a victory for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has worked hard to reach a deal with the country\u2019s lenders - such as vulture funds who bought Argentinian debt after its defaulted.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/argentina-reaches-deal-debt-vulture-funds-mediator-155544401.html?ref=gs\">Cutting a deal with such predatory investors can\u2019t be pleasant</a>, but it does allow Argentina to borrow from the markets again. </p> <p><strong>Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investment, argues it\u2019s an important development:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe success of the issue is seen as an endorsement of new president Macri, as it is a huge step forwards with regards to improving Argentina\u2019s financial credibility.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57162559e4b0585020da6e19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T12:43:31.406Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oh dear.

This was the green light the DAX needed to roar in to life, jumping by over 200 points to 10350, within a 150 leap away from a fresh 2016 peak. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5715fefae4b0d449d341ebb7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-19T09:55:01.606Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek bailout talks resume today</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greece\u2019s government is resuming talks with its lenders this afternoon over its economic reforms, as the Greek debt crisis threatens to heat up.</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s the first meeting since the International Monetary Fund pushed for Greece\u2019s bailout to be rewritten, to remove unachievable fiscal targets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/status/722360790641205248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Scheduled meetings of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> gov&#39;t w/ mission chiefs on Tue:<br>3pm - Education<br>4pm - Energy<br>5pm - (Privatisation) Fund<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/economy?src=hash\">#economy</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ec?src=hash\">#ec</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ecb?src=hash\">#ecb</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/esm?src=hash\">#esm</a></p>&mdash; Manos Giakoumis (@ManosGiakoumis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/status/722360790641205248\">April 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HelenaSmithGDN/status/722360887873507328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/greek?src=hash\">#greek</a> finance ministry says negotiations with country&#39;s creditor quartet will resume at 3PM 2day with gov officials meeting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IMF?src=hash\">#IMF</a> at 5 PM</p>&mdash; Helena Smith (@HelenaSmithGDN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenaSmithGDN/status/722360887873507328\">April 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Greece hasn\u2019t yet convinced its creditors that it has done enough to quality for debt relief, as they wrangle over bad debt rules and pension reforms.</p> <p>The creditors are understood to be pushing for Greece to sign up to extra austerity, in case the bailout programme goes off course.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-creditors-push-for-more-austerity-1460993528\">The Wall Street Journal explains</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The package would be triggered only if Greece falls short of targets over the next three years.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Who is Sir Martin Sorrell?</strong></h2> <p>The 71-year-old is one of the best-connected people in the business world. His career took off at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi where he spent nine years during the advertising firm\u2019s heyday in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was the brains behind many of its acquisitions. In 1985, he went solo by borrowing \u00a3250,000, using his Saatchi shares as security, to buy into Wire &amp; Plastic Products, a maker of shopping baskets. </p> <p>He used the small public company, later renamed WPP, as a vehicle to buy up advertising firms, stunning the business world in 1986 by launching a $566m (\u00a3394m) hostile takeover of J Walter Thompson in the US. Buying JWT, 13 times WPP\u2019s size and one of the oldest ad agencies in the US, put his company on the map. Sorrell has continued to make several acquisitions a year to maintain WPP as the world\u2019s biggest advertising company. WPP, which still makes plastic baskets, has 190,000 employees in 112 countries with annual revenue of \u00a312bn.</p> <p>Sorrell is the quintessential \u201cDavos man\u201d, named after the Swiss resort where the financial elite gather every January. But, after riding roughshod over the gentlemanly world of advertising to build WPP, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/04/wpp-sir-martin-sorrell-profile\">still sees himself as an outsider </a>and defends his pay as aggressively as he makes his deals. In 2010, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/04/wpp-sir-martin-sorrell-profile\">he told the Observer</a>: \u201cWell, a psychologist could say I have a Napoleonic complex because of my size. I am exactly the same size as Napoleon, as I have pointed out, and people have criticised me for saying it. Five foot six and a half, which, you know, French metrics, it is five foot four and a half, their feet are 13 inches or something.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98371d20889ccab2f52b2b1a22d05bf5b661986f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98371d20889ccab2f52b2b1a22d05bf5b661986f/139_217_4316_2591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s military hats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s military hats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How is he being paid \u00a370m?</h2> <p>The precise figure will be known next week when WPP publishes its annual report. But, a <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/wpp-plc--wpp-/rns/leap-2011-15/201603151759302096S/\">stock market announcement</a> last month detailing share awards, allows pretty good estimates to be made. It showed that Sorrell received 3,982,605 shares \u2013 worth \u00a362.78m \u2013 from a bonus scheme which dated back to 2011. Next week\u2019s annual report will include that sum alongside a \u00a31.1m salary \u2013 and, if last year\u2019s annual report is anything to go by, \u00a3463,000 of pension contributions, a short-term bonus (\u00a33.5m a year ago) and compensation for dividend payments from shares locked up in bonus schemes (\u00a31.2m a year ago).</p> <h2>How does a bonus scheme get to be worth \u00a363m?</h2> <p>The shares he has received were awarded to him in 2011 under a five-year bonus plan known as Leap \u2013 leadership equity acquisition plan. Those shares \u2013 worth \u00a326.5m in 2011 \u2013 were released to him after the company\u2019s performance against 15 competitors was measured between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2015, when WPP\u2019s total shareholder return (TSR) \u2013 which measures share price movements and dividends \u2013 was 135%. He sold about half to pay his taxes. Other WPP high flyers are part of the Leap.</p> <h2>So the pay is a one-off?</h2> <p>Well, no. Sorrell has received more than \u00a3200m from WPP in cash and shares in 15 years as a result of a number of share schemes, most notably Leap. The first <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jun/04/executivesalaries.executivepay\">big pay deal was for 2004</a> when he received \u00a350m.</p> <h2>So what exactly is this Leap that generates so much cash?</h2> <p>The Leap was first introduced in 1999. Under the scheme, participants buy shares and lock them up during the five-year performance period. There has been more than one scheme. Apart from the original Leap there was a \u201crenewed\u201d Leap and then Leap III.</p> <p>However, Leap is now being phased out. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/13/wpp-shareholders-vote-against-sorrell-pay\">After a shareholder revolt in 2012</a>, the company replaced it with a new scheme, called the executive performance share plan, in 2013. The new scheme is also based on a five-year period and is linked not just to TSR but also to other measures of performance \u2013 such as earnings per share and return on equity. </p> <p>Even so, there is still one last remaining Leap, from 2012, which will pay out in 2017.</p> <h2>So is Sorrell the highest paid FTSE 100 boss ever?</h2> <p> No. In 2010, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/07/reckitt-benckiser-bart-becht-pay\">Bart Becht, then the chief executive of Cillit Bang-to-Clearasil business group Reckitt Beckiser, received \u00a390m</a> from awards of cheap and free shares.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>So was that biggest pay deal of all time?</h2> <p>No again. The amounts paid to Sorrell, Becht and other leaders of stockmarket-quoted companies are often dwarfed by the sums earned by owners of private companies such as Sir Philip Green, the TopShop tycoon, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/oct/21/executivesalaries.executivepay\">who paid himself a \u00a31.2bn dividend in 2005</a>. That was the biggest payday in UK corporate history. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01688c524f53b4ca0034d2afd4ff578507182217\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01688c524f53b4ca0034d2afd4ff578507182217/1130_32_1440_865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The frow factorSir Philip Green pictured with Cara Delevingne, left, and Jourdan Dunn during London fashion week last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The frow factor. Sir Philip Green pictured with Cara Delevingne, left, and Jourdan Dunn during London fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images for Topshop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The finger often points at bankers, although the biggest pay deals are handed out to bankers outside the boardroom so are not disclosed publicly. Glimpses emerge from time to time. In 2011, Barclays <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/07/barclays-hands-five-bankers-110m\">revealed that two of its most senior investment bankers </a>\u2013 Jerry Del Missier and Rich Ricci \u2013 had been handed \u00a340m each after share deals awarded over the previous five years paid out. </p> <p> Bankers also accumulate wealth: Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, has been valued <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/03/jp-morgan-jamie-dimon-billionaire-bloomberg\">at more than $1bn </a>by the Bloomberg billionaires index. </p> <p>Hedge fund managers can expect more. Multiples more. John Paulson, who runs his eponymous hedge fund, received $3.7bn in 2007 after betting against subprime mortgages.</p> <h2>How does Sorrell justify it?</h2> <p>Sorrell rolls out the usual answers \u2013 his pay is set by an independent compensation committee which links rewards to targets.  </p> <p>He also employs what is called the L\u2019Oreal defence \u2013 \u201cbecause I\u2019m worth it\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/18/sir-martin-sorrell-im-worth-every-penny-im-paid\">He told a conference earlier this week</a>: \u201cWPP [was] capitalised at \u00a31m [at its start in 1985]. Today it is capitalised at \u00a321bn. I\u2019m not a Johnny-come-lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big pay day]. If it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years \u2026 I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.\u201d</p> <p>He also insists that he is a business owner, rather than a manager who has risen to the top, who put his own money on the line and turned WPP from a basket maker to a giant FTSE 100 company.

      "bodyText": "Who is Sir Martin Sorrell? The 71-year-old is one of the best-connected people in the business world. His career took off at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi where he spent nine years during the advertising firm\u2019s heyday in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was the brains behind many of its acquisitions. In 1985, he went solo by borrowing \u00a3250,000, using his Saatchi shares as security, to buy into Wire &amp; Plastic Products, a maker of shopping baskets. He used the small public company, later renamed WPP, as a vehicle to buy up advertising firms, stunning the business world in 1986 by launching a $566m (\u00a3394m) hostile takeover of J Walter Thompson in the US. Buying JWT, 13 times WPP\u2019s size and one of the oldest ad agencies in the US, put his company on the map. Sorrell has continued to make several acquisitions a year to maintain WPP as the world\u2019s biggest advertising company. WPP, which still makes plastic baskets, has 190,000 employees in 112 countries with annual revenue of \u00a312bn. Sorrell is the quintessential \u201cDavos man\u201d, named after the Swiss resort where the financial elite gather every January. But, after riding roughshod over the gentlemanly world of advertising to build WPP, he still sees himself as an outsider and defends his pay as aggressively as he makes his deals. In 2010, he told the Observer: \u201cWell, a psychologist could say I have a Napoleonic complex because of my size. I am exactly the same size as Napoleon, as I have pointed out, and people have criticised me for saying it. Five foot six and a half, which, you know, French metrics, it is five foot four and a half, their feet are 13 inches or something.\u201d How is he being paid \u00a370m? The precise figure will be known next week when WPP publishes its annual report. But, a stock market announcement last month detailing share awards, allows pretty good estimates to be made. It showed that Sorrell received 3,982,605 shares \u2013 worth \u00a362.78m \u2013 from a bonus scheme which dated back to 2011. Next week\u2019s annual report will include that sum alongside a \u00a31.1m salary \u2013 and, if last year\u2019s annual report is anything to go by, \u00a3463,000 of pension contributions, a short-term bonus (\u00a33.5m a year ago) and compensation for dividend payments from shares locked up in bonus schemes (\u00a31.2m a year ago). How does a bonus scheme get to be worth \u00a363m? The shares he has received were awarded to him in 2011 under a five-year bonus plan known as Leap \u2013 leadership equity acquisition plan. Those shares \u2013 worth \u00a326.5m in 2011 \u2013 were released to him after the company\u2019s performance against 15 competitors was measured between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2015, when WPP\u2019s total shareholder return (TSR) \u2013 which measures share price movements and dividends \u2013 was 135%. He sold about half to pay his taxes. Other WPP high flyers are part of the Leap. So the pay is a one-off? Well, no. Sorrell has received more than \u00a3200m from WPP in cash and shares in 15 years as a result of a number of share schemes, most notably Leap. The first big pay deal was for 2004 when he received \u00a350m. So what exactly is this Leap that generates so much cash? The Leap was first introduced in 1999. Under the scheme, participants buy shares and lock them up during the five-year performance period. There has been more than one scheme. Apart from the original Leap there was a \u201crenewed\u201d Leap and then Leap III. However, Leap is now being phased out. After a shareholder revolt in 2012, the company replaced it with a new scheme, called the executive performance share plan, in 2013. The new scheme is also based on a five-year period and is linked not just to TSR but also to other measures of performance \u2013 such as earnings per share and return on equity. Even so, there is still one last remaining Leap, from 2012, which will pay out in 2017. So is Sorrell the highest paid FTSE 100 boss ever? No. In 2010, Bart Becht, then the chief executive of Cillit Bang-to-Clearasil business group Reckitt Beckiser, received \u00a390m from awards of cheap and free shares. So was that biggest pay deal of all time? No again. The amounts paid to Sorrell, Becht and other leaders of stockmarket-quoted companies are often dwarfed by the sums earned by owners of private companies such as Sir Philip Green, the TopShop tycoon, who paid himself a \u00a31.2bn dividend in 2005. That was the biggest payday in UK corporate history. The finger often points at bankers, although the biggest pay deals are handed out to bankers outside the boardroom so are not disclosed publicly. Glimpses emerge from time to time. In 2011, Barclays revealed that two of its most senior investment bankers \u2013 Jerry Del Missier and Rich Ricci \u2013 had been handed \u00a340m each after share deals awarded over the previous five years paid out. Bankers also accumulate wealth: Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, has been valued at more than $1bn by the Bloomberg billionaires index. Hedge fund managers can expect more. Multiples more. John Paulson, who runs his eponymous hedge fund, received $3.7bn in 2007 after betting against subprime mortgages. How does Sorrell justify it? Sorrell rolls out the usual answers \u2013 his pay is set by an independent compensation committee which links rewards to targets. He also employs what is called the L\u2019Oreal defence \u2013 \u201cbecause I\u2019m worth it\u201d. He told a conference earlier this week: \u201cWPP [was] capitalised at \u00a31m [at its start in 1985]. Today it is capitalised at \u00a321bn. I\u2019m not a Johnny-come-lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big pay day]. If it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years \u2026 I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.\u201d He also insists that he is a business owner, rather than a manager who has risen to the top, who put his own money on the line and turned WPP from a basket maker to a giant FTSE 100 company. However, his stake is only 1.6% of WPP, which is tiny compared with a typical owner-manager. Sorrell has countered \u201cI am an owner, not the owner. I don\u2019t treat it as my own personal fiefdom or empire, but my ownership concentrates my mind. Every time that share price moves 10p one way or the other, it means millions to me.\u201d Other shareholders, he says, benefit from his commitment, drive and knowledge. How do others view his pay packet? In last year\u2019s annual report, Sir John Hood, who chairs WPP\u2019s compensation committee and agrees Sorrell\u2019s pay deals, said: \u201cThe value of Sir Martin\u2019s award, while large by any standard, equates to approximately one-third of 1% of the increase in value for share owners.\u201d Other businessmen agree. John Timpson, who owns the Timpson shoe repair chain, has described Sorrell as the business world\u2019s equivalent of Lionel Messi, Simon Cowell or Elton John and reckons the WPP boss is underpaid in comparison. \u201cIt is not as if his windfall had come from secretly manipulating the Libor rate or getting a bung for fixing a Fifa vote. He played to the rules and should be paid accordingly,\u201d Timpson wrote in the Telegraph (partial paywall). Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, does not doubt Sorrell\u2019s credentials as a businessman, but said it created problems for appointing his successor. \u201cSometimes [sums] are just too big \u2013 this is an example of just too big.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Primark reveals first fall in half-year sales in 12 years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Primark has revealed its first fall in half-year underlying sales in 12 years amid a tough UK market and a rash of store openings in Germany and the Netherlands. Unseasonably warm weather in the UK and across northern Europe leading up to Christmas hit sales at the once rapidly growing chain\u2019s established stores \u2013 although the company said the fall was less than 1%. Opening of stores in Germany and the Netherlands took sales away from group\u2019s older outlets in those countries. Sales in France and Spain were strong and the company also opened its first outlet in Italy. George Weston, chief executive of Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods, said clothing sales in the UK continued to be difficult in recent weeks but it was unclear whether shoppers had been put off by a chilly spring, or there was a wider issue for clothing retailers. \u201cWe need some warm weather and then we will know if there is a real problem on the high street,\u201d he said. \u201cEaster being early doesn\u2019t help as it is often a trigger for people switching to summer buying. People are spending their money on other things than clothing at the moment but that might be because they don\u2019t want spring/summer yet. It could be that when spring and summer arrive they will switch back.\u201d His comments come after more than \u00a33bn was wiped off the stock market value of Next, now the country\u2019s biggest clothing retailer, last month when its chief executive, Simon Wolfson, said that trading conditions were the toughest since the financial crisis. Weston said it was too early to tell if Wolfson was right but that Primark had been able to increase profits even in the face of poor sales in the UK, its biggest market. \u201cThat\u2019s a consequence of good stock management and then you try to provide the best fashion at the best price. If there is greater market change going on you can\u2019t do much about it but have to be the best fashion business going,\u201d he said. Jamie Merriman, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said that, despite the fall in underlying sales, Primark had managed to keep a tighter rein on profit margins than expected. The company offset the devaluation of the euro against the dollar, which Primark uses to buy most of its garments overseas, by managing stocks tightly and buying cleverly so that it was able to clear products without having to discount as much as the previous year, he explained. Despite the sales fall at Primark, Associated British Foods revealed a better than expected 4% rise in underlying pretax profit to \u00a3466m in the six months to 27 February. This was despite sales falling by 2% to \u00a36.1bn. Profits were helped by ABF\u2019s sugar business, which moved back into the black with a profit of \u00a36m, compared with a loss of \u00a33m a year before, as revenue rose 3% to \u00a3843m. That recovery, as well as a strong performance by its ingredients business, which sells bakery and other foodstuffs to manufacturers and food outlets, and at its grocery division, which owns brands including Twinings and Kingsmill, helped offset a decline in profits at Primark. The retail business\u2019s operating profit, which represents more than half of ABF\u2019s profits, fell 1% to \u00a3313m as it was hit by exchange rate headwinds as well as investment in opening stores in the US. Total sales rose 5% to \u00a32.7bn. ABF said that early trading at its two Primark outlets in the US \u2013 in Boston and Philadelphia \u2013 had been \u201cencouraging with very positive feedback\u201d. It added that it expected to have nine stores in the country by the end of 2016 including one in New Jersey. The company reiterated its expectations of a \u201cmarginal decline\u201d in earnings per share for the financial year, which ends in August.",

      "body": "<p>Primark has revealed its first fall in half-year underlying sales in 12 years amid a tough UK market and a rash of store openings in Germany and the Netherlands.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/14/primark-blames-freak-december-weather-for-flat-sales-figures\">Unseasonably warm weather in the UK and across northern Europe leading up to Christmas</a> hit sales at the once rapidly growing chain\u2019s established stores \u2013 although the company said the fall was less than 1%. Opening of stores in Germany and the Netherlands took sales away from group\u2019s older outlets in those countries. Sales in France and Spain were strong and the company also opened its first outlet in Italy.</p> <p>George Weston, chief executive of Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods, said clothing sales in the UK continued to be difficult in recent weeks but it was unclear whether shoppers had been put off by a chilly spring, or there was a wider issue for clothing retailers.</p> <p>\u201cWe need some warm weather and then we will know if there is a real problem on the high street,\u201d he said. \u201cEaster being early doesn\u2019t help as it is often a trigger for people switching to summer buying. People are spending their money on other things than clothing at the moment but that might be because they don\u2019t want spring/summer yet. It could be that when spring and summer arrive they will switch back.\u201d</p> <p>His comments come after more than \u00a33bn was wiped off the stock market value of Next, now the country\u2019s biggest clothing retailer, last month when its chief executive, Simon Wolfson, said that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/24/next-warns-of-toughest-trading-since-financial-crisis-and-cuts-sales-forecast\">trading conditions were the toughest since the financial crisis</a>.</p> <p>Weston said it was too early to tell if Wolfson was right but that Primark had been able to increase profits even in the face of poor sales in the UK, its biggest market. \u201cThat\u2019s a consequence of good stock management and then you try to provide the best fashion at the best price. If there is greater market change going on you can\u2019t do much about it but have to be the best fashion business going,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jamie Merriman, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said that, despite the fall in underlying sales, Primark had managed to keep a tighter rein on profit margins than expected. The company offset the devaluation of the euro against the dollar, which Primark uses to buy most of its garments overseas, by managing stocks tightly and buying cleverly so that it was able to clear products without having to discount as much as the previous year, he explained.</p> <p>Despite the sales fall at Primark, Associated British Foods revealed a better than expected 4% rise in underlying pretax profit to \u00a3466m in the six months to 27 February. This was despite sales falling by 2% to \u00a36.1bn.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Profits were helped by ABF\u2019s sugar business, which moved back into the black with a profit of \u00a36m, compared with a loss of \u00a33m a year before, as revenue rose 3% to \u00a3843m.</p> <p>That recovery, as well as a strong performance by its ingredients business, which sells bakery and other foodstuffs to manufacturers and food outlets, and at its grocery division, which owns brands including Twinings and Kingsmill, helped offset a decline in profits at Primark. </p> <p>The retail business\u2019s operating profit, which represents more than half of ABF\u2019s profits, fell 1% to \u00a3313m as it was hit by exchange rate headwinds as well as investment in opening stores in the US. Total sales rose 5% to \u00a32.7bn.</p> <p>ABF said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/10/primark-irish-retailer-opens-flagship-store-boston\">early trading at its two Primark outlets in the US</a> \u2013 in Boston and Philadelphia \u2013 had been \u201cencouraging with very positive feedback\u201d. It added that it expected to have nine stores in the country by the end of 2016 including one in New Jersey.</p> <p>The company reiterated its expectations of a \u201cmarginal decline\u201d in earnings per share for the financial year, which ends in August. </p>",

Budweiser and Stella Artois-owner AB InBev said the deal, which mainly concerns businesses in the UK, Italy and the Netherlands, was conditional on its \u00a371bn takeover of SABMiller going ahead. The sale of the three brands appears designed to stave off any competition worries that might have seen European regulators raise concerns about the combined firm\u2019s share of the market. The takeover \u2013 dubbed Megabrew in some corners of the financial world \u2013 will create a global drinks titan responsible for the sale of one in three beers worldwide. And the scale of the combined business has seen the prospective partners move to offload businesses in key markets, in a bid to pre-empt intervention from competition regulators. SAB has already agreed to sell its 58% stake in MillerCoors to joint venture partner MolsonCoors for $12bn (\u00a38.3bn) , while it is also selling its 49% stake in the Chinese firm behind Snow lager, the world\u2019s best-selling beer. The latest pre-emptive sale includes the Meantime brand that SABMiller took over last year as it sought to buy in to the growing popularity of small breweries. The Camden Town Brewery, bought by ABInBev for the same reason, will now be the combined firm\u2019s sole \u201ccraft beer\u201d offering in the UK. Both Meantime and Camden Town Brewery have attracted criticism for abandoning their small brewer ethos by accepting takeovers from vast multinational corporations. AB InBev employs 155,000 people, compared with 70,000 at SABMiller. Their combined revenues add up to $73bn, which is higher than companies such as Google or PepsiCo. The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, pending clearance from regulators and shareholders. AB InBev will pay \u00a344 a share for SABMiller, up from its initial offer of \u00a338 made privately in September. The takeover will allow Belgium\u2019s AB InBev to tap into SABMiller\u2019s strength in fast-growing African and Asian markets. The combined firm, due to be listed in Belgium, is expected to make cost savings of $1.4bn, some of which will come from reducing staff numbers.",

      "bodyText": "With oil holding steady despite the weekend\u2019s failure by oil producers to agree an output freeze, leading shares are moving higher again, with Primark owner Associated British Foods one of the big gainers following its latest figures. The company reported a 3% rise in half year profits to a better than expected \u00a3486m, but the figures were sweetened by a revival in the sugar business, which recorded a small improvement after several years of decline. The business benefited from cost cutting which the company said was necessary with sugar prices low and the withdrawal of EU quotas expected next year. ABF said movements in exchange rates had held back profits, but sterling\u2019s recent weakness would benefit the business in the second half if the trend continued. Indeed profits at Primark fell at actual exchange rates, and trading was also tough around Christmas due to the unseasonably warm weather. Like for like sales in the first half were down 1%, but it said the early trading at its US stores had been encouraging. But the company warned of uncertainties over the EU referendum and the proposed sugar tax on soft drinks unveiled in the budget. In a buy note Liberum said|: ABF offers investors compelling exposure to secular growth trends in retail. Primark\u2019s brand of fast fashion at affordable prices coupled with a buzzy and trendy shopping experience resonates with a wide spread of consumers. ABF\u2019s deliberate and considered expansion into Continental Europe demonstrates that the concept is portable. We expect similar results in the US as the group dips its toe into the market with 8 stores in the Northeast. We estimate that Primark can double sales and profits over the next 5 years boosted by the occasional store parcel. The shakeout in EU sugar should lead to industry consolidation, lower beet prices and cost savings boosting Sugar profits mid-term. ABF\u2019s shares have added 73p to \u00a334.20, but other clothing retailers have slipped back on the comments about Primark\u2019s first half trading. Marks and Spencer is down 4.1p at 438.4p while Next has fallen 25p to \u00a354.05. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 38.02 points to 6391.54, as Brent crude added 0.8% to $43.26. A strike in Kuwait is outweighing worries about the inability of Opec and other producers to take action to stem the supply glut. Despite this, commodity companies are mixed. Royal Dutch Shell B shares have slipped 12.5p to 1792.5p while Rio Tinto is down 6.5p to \u00a322.62 after its production update. But Anglo American has added 15.4p to 709p. But Vodafone has added 4.4p to 232.75p after Goldman Sachs raised its target price from 246p to 260p late on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "On 10 November, 2003, Gerry Florent, and Ralph Abercia, plus his son, Ralph Jr, left the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, and drove to the Stirling Club, a high-end private venue just off the Strip. They were to attend separate meetings with Sir Richard Benson, but had met each other that morning, when they were collectively coached on the etiquette expected of them: speak only when spoken to, stand when he comes in. They were happy to comply. This was a man who had bailed out the Queen, after all. Both Florent and the Abercias wanted the same thing from Sir Richard: money, of which he had plenty. Sir Richard, who was portly, balding and elderly, explained to them that he owned a company named Sherwin &amp; Noble, which was worth billions and was prepared to finance their business projects. At their meetings, the prospective investors received a glossy spiral-bound summary of S&amp;N\u2019s balance sheet, which showed it to be a financial firm of significant size. Florent wanted $55m to buy land on which to build a hotel in Florida; the Abercias needed $105m for an \u201caquarium/entertainment complex\u201d in Houston. In return for the money, all Sir Richard asked was that they pay advance fees (two payments of $412,250 each from Florent, and two payments of $787,500 each from the Abercias) to signal their commitment to the projects. If S&amp;N decided not to go ahead with the loans, the fees would be repaid. The investors left Las Vegas, instructed their lawyers to wire the first tranche of the fees over, and settled down to wait for their money. They waited. And they waited. When they rang or faxed the S&amp;N office in London, they were reassured that there was nothing to be concerned about. But, over the next few months, Florent and his business associates became suspicious. They held off wiring the second half of the fee, and brought in a private investigator, who discovered that S&amp;N, far from being worth billions, was an empty shell company. The glossy booklet detailing its assets had been copied from the banking company HBOS, with the names changed. Thus, the fraud fell apart. The Abercias, who had wired the whole fee asked of them, were devastated. \u201cThat was a lot of money,\u201d Ralph Sr told a local journalist. \u201cWe\u2019re still paying the damgum thing back.\u201d The whole saga had been scripted by a conman named Lal Bhatia. Sir Richard Benson was an actor. He had never rescued Buckingham Palace from foreclosure. The billions and the knighthood were fictitious. S&amp;N had no assets, beyond a registered presence at a house in London \u2013 29 Harley Street. * * * Eight years later, on the other side of the world, representatives of a Dutch shipping company named Allseas met the businessman Marek Rejniak to finalise an investment proposal. Allseas had \u20ac100m in cash, but it needed more if it was to build a vessel to dismantle oil rigs. The company was looking for ways to increase its capital. Rejniak claimed his team could double any investment in 30 days, and provide \u20ac1.2 billion within three years. At the meeting, which took place on 16 October 2011 in Malta, Rejniak claimed to have links to the US Federal Reserve, the Vatican and the Spanish House of Aragon, which gave him access to lucrative forms of secret trading in financial instruments known as medium term notes. The actual buying and selling would be done in London by someone named Luis Nobre, described by Rejniak as an \u201cA1 trader\u201d. (His companies were called The LARN Holdings and ERBON Wealth Management, their names being derived respectively from Nobre\u2019s initials, and from his surname spelt backwards.) The next day, Allseas transferred the whole \u20ac100m to Rejniak\u2019s Maltese company, and Rejniak sent the money to LARN\u2019s account in London. Once it was in London, Nobre began to spend it. Nobre is Portuguese. His long, dark hair has a few strands of silver threaded through it, and his beard is carefully groomed. At his trial for fraud at Southwark crown court, which ended in February with him being jailed for 14 years, he wore beautifully cut pinstripe suits, his tie always matching his pocket square. (The police have not yet tracked down his fellow fraudster Rejniak.) Before Nobre\u2019s arrest, he had lived in a suite at Marylebone\u2019s five-star Landmark Hotel, where he left \u00a3100-plus tips. The money he defrauded ran through his investment companies, which were \u2013 just like S&amp;N \u2013 registered at 29 Harley Street. * * * No 29 Harley Street does not look like a centre of intricate intercontinental fraud. It is a handsome stone-fronted terraced house, a couple of minutes\u2019 walk from the shops and the tourists of Oxford Street. It is five storeys high, with a bay window on the ground floor, an intricate steel balcony at first-floor level, and a stone balustrade just under the roof. Its front door is dark wood, with brass fittings. Until his death in 1991, this was the home and place of business of Professor Ronald Raven, an internationally renowned surgeon, philanthropist, soldier, pianist, amateur theologian and connoisseur of porcelain. During his lifetime, 29 Harley Street was a trove of beautiful objects: paintings, furniture, clocks, ornaments that he had collected during almost half a century in residence. Photographs taken towards the end of his life show him to have been grey-haired and distinguished, the very epitome of the successful medical practitioner on a street that has long been synonymous with high-class healthcare. Over the decades, doctors like him have imbued Harley Street with an aura of authority; an aura that surrounds any venture based here. There are dozens of properties on Harley Street still used by doctors, but No 29 is not one of them. Instead, it is home to a company named Formations House, which, since it was founded in 2001, has made a business out of conjuring corporate vehicles from the West End air. The house is currently home to 2,159 companies, for which it operates as a large, ornate and prestigiously located postbox and answerphone. There is nothing illegal in this but some have used this address for improper purposes. In its promotional literature, Formations House makes much of its location, stating for example, that: \u201call your postal [sic] will be received in Central London at a prestigious Harley Street business address\u201d. Company formation agents create the vast majority of the 585,000 new companies formed each year in the UK, and a Harley Street address helps this one stand out from the crowd. Companies are both easy and cheap to establish in Britain \u2013 and the process is almost entirely unmonitored. Nobre and Bhatia are far from the only criminals to have realised that they are pretty much the perfect weapon for fraud. * * * It is an article of faith in modern politics that creating companies should be as easy as possible. They are the building blocks of capitalism, helping investors to form joint ventures, while limiting their exposure to losses if the ventures go wrong. Since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, the UK government has gradually made creating companies easier, and the number of them on the corporate register has grown accordingly. In 1978, 744,000 companies were registered in the UK. By 1989, there were a million. By 2001, there were two million. This was in an era when applications still had to be filed on paper. \u201cBefore the digital age this was often a costly and laborious task,\u201d lamented the World Bank\u2019s 2015 Doing Business report, which included a case study of Britain\u2019s deregulation of the sector. \u201cIt involved visits to Companies House, long lines and the higher costs associated with postal mail. Company founders often had to hire solicitors to handle paperwork.\u201d In 2001, the government did away with all that, and Companies House \u2013 the institution that registers British corporations, after which the name of Formations House is presumably modelled \u2013 introduced online applications. A boom began, and there are now 3.5m companies registered in the UK. Dozens of company formation agents popped up to take advantage of this new system \u2013 among them Nadeem Khan and his wife Danielle Ardern, the founders of Formations House. In the most basic sense, company formation agents simply create companies for people who do not want to do it for themselves. The sector has expanded, however, in all sorts of directions: most notably by creating \u201cshelf\u201d companies. Shelf companies are ready-made and available for purchase. Their advantage to the purchaser is that they give a reassuring impression of longevity to what is essentially a brand-new operation, since they have documents extending back years. By law, all British companies must have two things: a director, who runs the company, and a shareholder, who owns it. They can also (but do not have to) have a secretary who, in a legitimate operation, takes on much of a director\u2019s work. To create shelf companies, company formation agents need directors and secretaries. And this is when things start to get complicated, because they use other companies to do jobs designed for humans. As soon as companies were involved in owning other companies, as well as being their directors and secretaries, it became extremely difficult to discover who really controlled them (ie who was the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d, the person who received any benefit from the company). In February 2004, for example, Formations House created three companies: Corporate Nominees, Legal Nominees, and Professional Nominees. The second company owns the other two, while itself being owned by the first company. The third company is secretary for the other two, while its own secretary is the first company. The second company is director of the other two, while its own director is the first company. These three companies then became directors, secretaries and shareholders of other structures, in an increasingly baffling multidimensional web of crisscrossing lines of control. If you looked for the companies\u2019 real owners, the most you could eventually discover was that the original three all owned, controlled and managed each other. To solve problems like this, in 2008 parliament decided that companies must have at least one real person as a director. In response, company formation agents signed up people who, for a fee, would declare themselves directors of newly created companies. Edwina Coales, a serial director of companies registered at 29 Harley Street, is or has been an officer at 1,560 of the companies listed on the Companies House website. And that\u2019s only the start of it. Formations House does not just create companies in Britain, but also in Gambia, Hong Kong, the Seychelles, the British Virgin Islands, Ireland, the US state of Delaware, Panama, Gibraltar, Jersey, the Isle of Man, Belize and Mauritius. Its website boasts of having formed more than 450,000 corporate entities: that is more companies than there are in Jersey, Guernsey and the Cayman Islands put together. It has 25,000 shelf companies available for purchase right now, with nominee directors, secretaries and shareholders available too. Yet, its office is not in a tax haven in the Caribbean or the English Channel. It is right in the heart of central London, half an hour\u2019s walk from the Houses of Parliament, churning out companies for whoever wants them. Media outlets in Britain, the US, Norway, Italy, Ukraine and Romania have all made allegations of fraud against certain companies registered at 29 Harley Street. * * * Khan and Ardern (nee Coales) were born in November 1960 and February 1959, respectively. Not much is known about either of them, although Khan told police in a 2012 interview that he blogged under the name \u201cSam Soloman\u201d. The Formations House website is available in French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish and Arabic, and welcomes clients from all over the world. When Formations House created Sherwin &amp; Noble (it was initially called Q&amp;Q, then renamed, presumably to make it sound posh enough for \u201cSir Richard Benson\u201d), Khan was its shareholder and secretary, his wife Ardern was its director, and \u201cSam Soloman\u201d was the person to be contacted if Companies House had any queries. As the years went by, Khan and Ardern began to distance themselves from the companies they formed. When Formations House created companies for Nobre \u2013 The LARN Holdings Ltd, and ERBON Wealth Management Ltd \u2013 in 2011, the secretary was Nominee Secretary Ltd, a Harley Street shell owned by Corporate Nominees Ltd, and thus by the triangle of interlocking companies at the heart of Formations House. Nominee Secretary Ltd\u2019s director was the serial nominee Edwina Coales, born 16 April 1935. It is not known how Coales\u2019 relationship with Formations House began, but it is perhaps relevant that she was born 23 years before Ardern and that her surname is the same as Ardern\u2019s maiden name. Formations House has abided by the letter of British law, but successfully created structures that are all but impossible to penetrate for anyone trying to discover who really owns them. \u201cIf organised crime depends on financial secrecy, untraceable shell companies are the most important means of providing it,\u201d wrote the authors of a 2012 study of company formation agents, Global Shell Games. \u201cShell companies that cannot be traced back to their real owners are widely held to be one of the most common means of laundering money, giving and receiving bribes, busting sanctions, evading taxes, and financing terrorism.\u201d In the book, the authors tracked to what extent company formation agents in different countries requested their clients identify themselves before selling them shelf companies. In Britain, almost half of agents were happy to sell a company without checking the identity of the person buying it. If the agent does not record the beneficial owner of a company, then there is no way law enforcement officers can discover that information. And that is a problem, because the qualities that so endear companies to legitimate businessmen are just as attractive to organised criminals. Fraudsters like to obscure their identity and avoid liability as much as, if not rather more than, the next man. It is simply easier to commit fraud if you can do it anonymously, unobtrusively, and behind the protective cover of a prestigious London address. \u201cThe question for me is this: as a police officer, what would I like?\u201d asked Commander Chris Greany of the City of London police, the force that leads efforts by UK police to fight fraud. \u201cWell, I\u2019d like everything to be locked down tight, of course I would, but that isn\u2019t the real world in which we all live. Society wants convenience, doesn\u2019t it? And the price of convenience today is there might be fraud on the back of it.\u201d Formations House is probably no better or worse than any of its competitors, of which there are around 300 listed in the Yellow Pages, it is just more visible. Its address is so unlikely that few journalists can resist mentioning the Harley Street connection when a company such as Sherwin &amp; Noble, The LARN Holdings or ERBON Wealth Management gets caught up in a fraud prosecution. And that has left a paper trail over the years, showing quite how many people have been ripped off by companies created in Professor\u2019s Raven old home. * * * VAT fraud may lack the glamour of some of the scams laid bare by the Panama Papers, but few financial crimes are more prevalent or more damaging. Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) estimates that the UK misses out on \u00a3500m to \u00a31bn every year, from VAT being claimed back illegally. Across the whole of the EU, the \u201cVAT gap\u201d \u2013 the amount missing through non-compliance or non-collection \u2013 was estimated in 2013 at \u20ac193bn. That would be enough to pay off Ireland\u2019s entire national debt, with a few billion left over to help the Greeks. In the most common scam, shelf companies move shipments of high-value goods (typically, mobile phones) in and out of EU states and pick up VAT repayments each time. The first company imports the goods, and sells them on via a chain of companies, which charge VAT on every sale. The final company then exports the goods, and claims back from the Treasury the VAT it has paid, while the first company disappears without passing on the VAT it has charged. The fraudster has thus earned free money, without having to do anything but register a series of sales. To commit the crime, all they require are several shelf companies, with their own bank accounts and VAT numbers, so they can do business with each other. You can buy such companies from a number of outlets, including Formations House. On its website Formations House does not give a price for this product, but competitors provide similar vehicles for as little as \u00a359.99). It is a near-perfect crime, almost impossible to uncover as long as the fraudster does not get greedy. We know about the most famous scam to have involved 29 Harley Street precisely because the criminals did not follow that advice. Aoife Madden, an actress and the niece of a member of the Northern Irish assembly, and an Iraqi investor, Bashar Al-Issa, along with three associates, used one corporate vehicle, Evolved Pictures Limited (registered at 29 Harley Street), to invoice another for services supposedly related to the production of a film. They then tried to claim back \u00a31.5m in VAT and almost as much again in film tax relief, a tax break designed to encourage film-making. Their crime was to claim it without actually making a film, and to charge VAT without passing it on to the Treasury. \u201cFalsely claiming VAT that is not due is illegal, so we are pleased that instead of this film flop going straight to DVD, these small-screen z-listers could go straight to jail,\u201d said John Pointing, HMRC\u2019s assistant director of criminal investigation, following their conviction in 2013. The five did indeed go to jail, but they remained curiously naive fraudsters. While awaiting trial, they set to making a film \u2013 called, improbably, Landscape of Lies \u2013 in the forlorn hope that its existence would erase the crime they had committed by not making one in the first place. The film was shot on the cheap. Its Middle Eastern scenes had clearly been filmed somewhere in the Home Counties, and its star was ex-GMTV weather girl turned Loose Women presenter Andrea McLean. Madden and Al-Issa neglected to tell the cast or the director they hired \u2013 an ex-bouncer named Paul Knight \u2013 that they were awaiting trial, however. When the case started, he was left without payment. So he looked for compensation at their company\u2019s registered office. \u201cAfter about three months of trying, I thought well, I\u2019m just going to turn up on the doorstep, mate,\u201d Knight told me. The prospect of Knight turning up on anyone\u2019s doorstep is a daunting one \u2013 he is a big bloke, but that didn\u2019t do him any good in this case. \u201cLo and behold, you realise that the swanky Harley Street address was just a building with a few letter boxes. It kind of put the final cherry on the cake,\u201d he said. He had discovered one of the great features of a corporate structure, which is how totally it can distance the owner from anyone trying to track them down. Knight never got his money, though Landscape of Lies gained a certain notoriety and indeed won an award at the Las Vegas film festival. (The festival rescinded the Silver Ace, however, after realising it had given a prize to a feature used as an unsuccessful alibi.) If it was difficult for a Brit to discover that a registered address at 29 Harley Street was meaningless, it was even harder for a Ukrainian. In the early years of Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s presidency, investigative journalists in Kiev could see that a piece of state-owned land in a forest outside the capital had been illegally privatised, but they did not know who by. The lakeside property, which was near the village of Sukholuchya, was transformed in the years after Yanukovych was elected in 2010 into a luxury residence, complete with a shooting range, chapel, yacht harbour, outdoor barbecue area, and more. The owner was clearly rich and influential, but any attempt to definitively track down his identity came up against Astute Partners Limited, registered at 29 Harley Street, legal owner of the Ukrainian company that owned the land. Astute Partners was owned by Blythe (Europe), another Harley Street company, which was in turn owned by P&amp;A Corporate Services Trust, registered at the Liechtenstein offices of an Austrian lawyer named Reinhard Proksch. Why would a wealthy Ukrainian want to own property via central London? According to Borys Danevych, a Ukrainian lawyer who has himself struggled to identify the owners of shell companies while investigating corporate structures, a key reason 29 Harley Street was chosen as a base was that it looked prestigious, but in reality was just a front. Astute Partners had to declare its shareholder, but that shareholder was a trust in Liechtenstein, which does not reveal company ownership, so the declaration was meaningless. Ukrainian court proceedings last year showed that the actual owner of the property was Yanukovych, who was overthrown in 2014. Proksch denies any wrongdoing, or any connection between Astute Partners and Yanukovych, and in 2014 insisted the companies belonged to \u201cUK/US and UAE based clients and foreign investors\u201d. The Ukrainian judge was not convinced, however, and the court took the land back into state ownership. Proksch failed to reply to my calls and emails requesting comment. * * * On a recent Friday afternoon, I decided to incorporate myself. I registered for a profile on the Companies House website, entered the information it asked for, chose a name for my company, and paid for it \u2013 all in just nine minutes. Some 36 hours later, on the Sunday morning, the email came through that my incorporation was successful. Oliver Bullough was now sole shareholder and director of Crooked Crook Crook Limited (under which name I receive a surprising number of letters. Just the other day, I was offered corporate car hire). Crooked Crook Crook is free to conduct business, its liabilities limited by legal guarantee, and no one at Companies House asked for any proof that the information I provided was accurate. It cost me \u00a315. The lack of checks is not wholly surprising. There were 200 new companies registered last year for every one of Companies House\u2019s 3,000 employees, on top of the millions of regulatory filings that existing companies make. There is clearly no way such a small number of people can process this mound of paperwork, which is why the accuracy of the registry relies on the honesty of the people providing it with information. If registering a birth or death was this easy, the opportunities for mischief would be endless. You could create as many \u201cpersons\u201d as you liked, then use them to claim benefits, vote, register businesses, or apply for a passport, then kill them off if they got into trouble. The rights of companies are more limited, but the opportunities for fraud are almost as broad. From 2010 to 2013, cold callers harassed thousands of British households with claims that land near the Brazilian seaside town of Fortaleza would rocket in price thanks to the then-forthcoming World Cup. The cold callers seemed plausible, and 600 people put up a total of \u00a319m. But, in 2013, the Insolvency Service stepped in, forcibly winding up a group of related companies involved in the scam, among them Pantheon Limited, and Pantheon Realty Consultancy Limited, both registered at 29 Harley Street. The only culprits the authorities could find were Ismael Rajabi and Ahmed Mohammadi, both from Afghanistan, whose names appeared on the companies\u2019 registration documents. They are real people, but Companies House had, of course, not checked if they actually were the owners of the companies, which they were not. The real shareholders vanished, taking the investors\u2019 money with them, and all the law could do was disqualify Rajabi and Mohammadi from being directors for 11 years. Some of the defrauded investors asked Chris Corney, a solicitor from Carter Lemon Camerons in London, to look into launching a civil action to recover their money. He advised them against it, since bringing a case would have cost them more than it could have recovered. \u201cLondon is such a free-for-all. We think of it as an orderly, well-regulated, law-bound economy, and you realise that actually it\u2019s incredibly laissez-faire. You\u2019ve got to run an awfully long way before the authorities will engage with you,\u201d he said. Yet Companies House\u2019s \u201cpolicy team\u201d insisted that this wide-open system was key to keeping Britain in business: \u201cThe aim of UK government is to not impose burdens of unnecessary regulation on companies, and risk discouraging people from setting up and running a business, the vast majority of whom are honest.\u201d So, if it is this easy to create a company, why employ an agent to do it? Simply, company formation agents do more than create companies, they also answer the phone, receive post, and do other administrative tasks. The Las Vegas fraud would have been impossible without the semblance of legitimacy these services provided, for example, and the proceeds contributed to the torrent of dirty money that pours into London each year. Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to cleanse Britain of this ill-gotten cash. His government has made it possible for anyone to search Companies House for free on the internet, and, from June, new companies will have to publish their beneficial owners \u2013 the people who really control them. That information provided will not be checked any more thoroughly than it is now, however, which leaves law enforcement agencies as overstretched as ever. * * * So, are the company formation agents who offer these services breaking the law? Nigel Kirby, deputy director of the National Crime Agency\u2019s Economic Crime Command, told me his team was investigating several agents, though he declined to specify which ones, and hoped to hand evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service this year. He said prosecutions could be brought under several sections of 2015\u2019s Serious Crime Act. Among the new law\u2019s provisions is one that obliges professionals to cease a business relationship if they are unable to discover the true identity of their client. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do so, you\u2019re liable to two years, and an unlimited fine,\u201d Kirby said. If his team does investigate Formations House, however, it may come up against the same difficulties that I did in finding anyone to talk to. Company filings record that Edwina Coales, the serial Formations House nominee who is still director of 49 companies, lives in a flat on Crawford Street in central London. However, when I visited the flat, the man who answered the door told me Coales had died \u201caround two years ago\u201d. Danielle Ardern, meanwhile, has no registered address except her office at 29 Harley Street, where I failed to find her when I showed up recently. The door buzzed open into a grand, marble-floored hall leading into the depths of the house. A staircase rose up to the left, and pictures of Egyptian antiquities hung on the walls. A young man emerged from a corridor to ask my business, and then ushered me into a conference room, where I waited until a young woman, with long dark hair and a slight European accent, came to ask what I wanted. I explained that I was interested in what happened in the building, and she looked concerned. \u201cWe would normally require information in writing, you understand,\u201d she said. \u201cMost publications can be not very positive, so we are careful.\u201d She wrote down her email address in my notebook, told me her name was Charlotte, and showed me out. I emailed her a list of questions about her place of work, but she did not reply to them, or return the phone messages I left for her. And that left just Nadeem Khan, the enabler of fraud on a grand scale. We know slightly more about him, thanks to the prosecution of Nobre, the Portuguese conman. After Nobre was arrested on 3 December 2011, the money he had obtained from Allseas was frozen. But Nobre continued to live in expensive hotels in Mayfair and St James\u2019s, with the funds coming from his Wembley-based lawyer Buddika Kadurugamuwa. (In February, she was convicted on one count of transferring criminal property, but avoided jail.) Although the police informed Nadeem Khan by fax in December that Nobre was under arrest, Khan continued to deal with him, and only filed a suspicious activity report on 6 January 2012, the day he was visited by a police officer. According to the prosecution, Khan did rather more than just sell companies to Nobre. \u201cHis actions \u2026 were key in allowing Nobre to launder more of the stolen Allseas money,\u201d the barrister\u2019s opening note stated. Prosecutors said Nobre had paid Khan \u00a3160,000 before the funds were frozen, nominally to buy four shelf companies. In reality, Khan used that money to finance pre-paid credit cards funded via a Cypriot bank and thus gave it back to Nobre by an obscure route, allowing the fraudster to keep spending Allseas\u2019 money even while on police bail. Nobre appears to have thought that filing a suspicious activity report protected him from any criminal liability. \u201cWe assumed that it was [approved], we had the all-clear to deal with him, so we continued to deal with him,\u201d Khan told police, according to comments quoted by the prosecuting barrister. Khan assumed wrong, and was charged alongside Nobre and Kadurugamuwa. He died last year, shortly before the trial began, so the jury had no chance to decide the merits of the crown\u2019s case against him. However, considering the sheer volume of frauds that have been publicly linked back to his office on Harley Street, it is hard not to wonder whether he played a similar role in other crimes too. He presumably would have charged handsomely for these backdoor services, as he did for the London phone numbers, the fax forwarding, the accountancy, and all the other legitimate services his company provided for his clients. If he did, where is the money? And, perhaps more importantly, who now owns this business in the heart of London that some have used for fraud? Formations House Ltd is owned by Nominee Director Ltd, which is owned by another Harley Street company \u2013 our old friend Legal Nominees Ltd. Professional Nominees Ltd is still the secretary for Legal Nominees, and Corporate Nominees Ltd is still a director. The other director, required by law to be a person, is a 37-year-old Pakistani man, who plays the same role in 1,033 other companies. But the business structure has changed since this triangle of companies was created in 2004 to guard the inner sanctum of Formations House. Perhaps it was not quite impenetrable enough. Since at least 2014, 200,000 shares in each of Legal Nominees Ltd, Corporate Nominees Ltd, and Professional Nominees Ltd have been owned by Sigma Tech Enterprises, which is registered at a service address in Hong Kong. There, however, is no company with that name on the Hong Kong corporate register. The Formations House website says that any disputes over the company\u2019s privacy policy will be decided under Seychelles law, so the whole 29 Harley Street operation may ultimately be owned on an Indian Ocean archipelago, although we cannot be sure, since the Seychelles does not open its corporate register. Public discussion about offshore tends to focus on the Seychelles, the British Virgin Islands or Panama: sunny places for shady people; remote countries full of dodgy money. But if 29 Harley Street tells us anything, it is that offshore isn\u2019t a place, it\u2019s an idea. Formations House is about as offshore as a place can be, and our government appears powerless to bring it back onshore again.

      "body": "<p>On 10 November, 2003, Gerry Florent, and Ralph Abercia, plus his son, Ralph Jr, left the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, and drove to the Stirling Club, a high-end private venue just off the Strip. They were to attend separate meetings with Sir Richard Benson, but had met each other that morning, when they were collectively coached on the etiquette expected of them: speak only when spoken to, stand when he comes in. They were happy to comply. This was a man who had bailed out the Queen, after all.</p> <p>Both Florent and the Abercias wanted the same thing from Sir Richard: money, of which he had plenty. Sir Richard, who was portly, balding and elderly, explained to them that he owned a company named Sherwin &amp; Noble, which was worth billions and was prepared to finance their business projects. At their meetings, the prospective investors received a glossy spiral-bound summary of S&amp;N\u2019s balance sheet, which showed it to be a financial firm of significant size.</p> <p>Florent wanted $55m to buy land on which to build a hotel in Florida; the Abercias needed $105m for an \u201caquarium/entertainment complex\u201d in Houston. In return for the money, all Sir Richard asked was that they pay advance fees (two payments of $412,250 each from Florent, and two payments of $787,500 each from the Abercias) to signal their commitment to the projects. If S&amp;N decided not to go ahead with the loans, the fees would be repaid.</p> <p>The investors left Las Vegas, instructed their lawyers to wire the first tranche of the fees over, and settled down to wait for their money. They waited. And they waited. When they rang or faxed the S&amp;N office in London, they were reassured that there was nothing to be concerned about. But, over the next few months, Florent and his business associates became suspicious. They held off wiring the second half of the fee, and brought in a private investigator, who discovered that S&amp;N, far from being worth billions, was an empty shell company. The glossy booklet detailing its assets had been copied from the banking company HBOS, with the names changed.</p> <p>Thus, the fraud fell apart. The Abercias, who had wired the whole fee asked of them, were devastated. \u201cThat was a lot of money,\u201d Ralph Sr told a local journalist. \u201cWe\u2019re still paying the damgum thing back.\u201d</p> <p>The whole saga had been scripted by a conman named Lal Bhatia. Sir Richard Benson was an actor. He had never rescued Buckingham Palace from foreclosure. The billions and the knighthood were fictitious. S&amp;N had no assets, beyond a registered presence at a house in London \u2013 29 Harley Street.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Eight years later, on the other side of the world, representatives of a Dutch shipping company named Allseas met the businessman Marek Rejniak to finalise an investment proposal. Allseas had \u20ac100m in cash, but it needed more if it was to build a vessel to dismantle oil rigs. The company was looking for ways to increase its capital. Rejniak claimed his team could double any investment in 30 days, and provide \u20ac1.2 billion within three years.</p> <p>At the meeting, which took place on 16 October 2011 in Malta, Rejniak claimed to have links to the US Federal Reserve, the Vatican and the Spanish House of Aragon, which gave him access to lucrative forms of secret trading in financial instruments known as medium term notes. The actual buying and selling would be done in London by someone named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/24/case-opens-against-city-trader-luis-nobre-73m-fraud\">Luis Nobre</a>, described by Rejniak as an \u201cA1 trader\u201d. (His companies were called The LARN Holdings and ERBON Wealth Management, their names being derived respectively from Nobre\u2019s initials, and from his surname spelt backwards.)</p> <p>The next day, Allseas transferred the whole \u20ac100m to Rejniak\u2019s Maltese company, and Rejniak sent the money to LARN\u2019s account in London. Once it was in London, Nobre began to spend it.</p> <p>Nobre is Portuguese. His long, dark hair has a few strands of silver threaded through it, and his beard is carefully groomed. At his trial for fraud at Southwark crown court, which ended in February with him being jailed for 14 years, he wore beautifully cut pinstripe suits, his tie always matching his pocket square. (The police have not yet tracked down his fellow fraudster Rejniak.) Before Nobre\u2019s arrest, he had lived in a suite at Marylebone\u2019s five-star Landmark Hotel, where he left \u00a3100-plus tips. The money he defrauded ran through his investment companies, which were \u2013 just like S&amp;N \u2013 registered at 29 Harley Street.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>No 29 Harley Street does not look like a centre of intricate intercontinental fraud. It is a handsome stone-fronted terraced house, a couple of minutes\u2019 walk from the shops and the tourists of Oxford Street. It is five storeys high, with a bay window on the ground floor, an intricate steel balcony at first-floor level, and a stone balustrade just under the roof. Its front door is dark wood, with brass fittings.</p> <p>Until his death in 1991, this was the home and place of business of Professor Ronald Raven, an internationally renowned surgeon, philanthropist, soldier, pianist, amateur theologian and connoisseur of porcelain. During his lifetime, 29 Harley Street was a trove of beautiful objects: paintings, furniture, clocks, ornaments that he had collected during almost half a century in residence.</p> <p>Photographs taken towards the end of his life show him to have been grey-haired and distinguished, the very epitome of the successful medical practitioner on a street that has long been synonymous with high-class healthcare. Over the decades, doctors like him have imbued Harley Street with an aura of authority; an aura that surrounds any venture based here.</p> <p>There are dozens of properties on Harley Street still used by doctors, but No 29 is not one of them. Instead, it is home to a company named Formations House, which, since it was founded in 2001, has made a business out of conjuring corporate vehicles from the West End air. The house is currently home to 2,159 companies, for which it operates as a large, ornate and prestigiously located postbox and answerphone. There is nothing illegal in this but some have used this address for improper purposes.</p> <p>In its promotional literature, Formations House makes much of its location, stating for example, that: \u201call your postal [sic] will be received in Central London at a prestigious Harley Street business address\u201d. Company formation agents create the vast majority of the 585,000 new companies formed each year in the UK, and a Harley Street address helps this one stand out from the crowd. Companies are both easy and cheap to establish in Britain \u2013 and the process is almost entirely unmonitored. Nobre and Bhatia are far from the only criminals to have realised that they are pretty much the perfect weapon for fraud.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It is an article of faith in modern politics that creating companies should be as easy as possible. They are the building blocks of capitalism, helping investors to form joint ventures, while limiting their exposure to losses if the ventures go wrong. Since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, the UK government has gradually made creating companies easier, and the number of them on the corporate register has grown accordingly. In 1978, 744,000 companies were registered in the UK. By 1989, there were a million. By 2001, there were two million.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Formations House has made a business out of conjuring corporate vehicles from the West End air</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This was in an era when applications still had to be filed on paper.<strong> </strong>\u201cBefore the digital age this was often a costly and laborious task,\u201d lamented the World Bank\u2019s 2015 Doing Business report, which included a case study of Britain\u2019s deregulation of the sector. \u201cIt involved visits to Companies House, long lines and the higher costs associated with postal mail. Company founders often had to hire solicitors to handle paperwork.\u201d</p> <p>In 2001, the government did away with all that, and Companies House \u2013 the institution that registers British corporations, after which the name of Formations House is presumably modelled \u2013 introduced online applications. A boom began, and there are now 3.5m companies registered in the UK.</p> <p>Dozens of company formation agents popped up to take advantage of this new system \u2013 among them Nadeem Khan and his wife Danielle Ardern, the founders of Formations House.</p> <p>In the most basic sense, company formation agents simply create companies for people who do not want to do it for themselves. The sector has expanded, however, in all sorts of directions: most notably by creating \u201cshelf\u201d companies. Shelf companies are ready-made and available for purchase. Their advantage to the purchaser is that they give a reassuring impression of longevity to what is essentially a brand-new operation, since they have documents extending back years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/08/fall-of-jersey-how-tax-haven-goes-bust\">The fall of Jersey: how a tax haven goes bust | Oliver Bullough</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By law, all British companies must have two things: a director, who runs the company, and a shareholder, who owns it. They can also (but do not have to) have a secretary who, in a legitimate operation, takes on much of a director\u2019s work. To create shelf companies, company formation agents need directors and secretaries. And this is when things start to get complicated, because they use other companies to do jobs designed for humans.</p> <p>As soon as companies were involved in owning other companies, as well as being their directors and secretaries, it became extremely difficult to discover who really controlled them (ie who was the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d, the person who received any benefit from the company). In February 2004, for example, Formations House created three companies: Corporate Nominees, Legal Nominees, and Professional Nominees. The second company owns the other two, while itself being owned by the first company. The third company is secretary for the other two, while its own secretary is the first company. The second company is director of the other two, while its own director is the first company. These three companies then became directors, secretaries and shareholders of other structures, in an increasingly baffling multidimensional web of crisscrossing lines of control. If you looked for the companies\u2019 real owners, the most you could eventually discover was that the original three all owned, controlled and managed each other.</p> <p>To solve problems like this, in 2008 parliament decided that companies must have at least one real person as a director. In response, company formation agents signed up people who, for a fee, would declare themselves directors of newly created companies. Edwina Coales, a serial director of companies registered at 29 Harley Street, is or has been an officer at 1,560 of the companies listed on the Companies House website.</p> <p>And that\u2019s only the start of it. Formations House does not just create companies in Britain, but also in Gambia, Hong Kong, the Seychelles, the British Virgin Islands, Ireland, the US state of Delaware, Panama, Gibraltar, Jersey, the Isle of Man, Belize and Mauritius. Its website boasts of having formed more than 450,000 corporate entities: that is more companies than there are in Jersey, Guernsey and the Cayman Islands put together. It has 25,000 shelf companies available for purchase right now, with nominee directors, secretaries and shareholders available too. Yet, its office is not in a tax haven in the Caribbean or the English Channel. It is right in the heart of central London, half an hour\u2019s walk from the Houses of Parliament, churning out companies for whoever wants them. Media outlets in Britain, the US, Norway, Italy, Ukraine and Romania have all made allegations of fraud against certain companies registered at 29 Harley Street.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Khan and Ardern (nee Coales) were born in November 1960 and February 1959, respectively. Not much is known about either of them, although Khan told police in a 2012 interview that he blogged under the name \u201cSam Soloman\u201d.</p> <p> The Formations House website is available in French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish and Arabic, and welcomes clients from all over the world. When Formations House created Sherwin &amp; Noble (it was initially called Q&amp;Q, then renamed, presumably to make it sound posh enough for \u201cSir Richard Benson\u201d), Khan was its shareholder and secretary, his wife Ardern was its director, and \u201cSam Soloman\u201d was the person to be contacted if Companies House had any queries.</p> <p>As the years went by, Khan and Ardern began to distance themselves from the companies they formed. When Formations House created companies for Nobre \u2013 The LARN Holdings Ltd, and ERBON Wealth Management Ltd \u2013 in 2011, the secretary was Nominee Secretary Ltd, a Harley Street shell owned by Corporate Nominees Ltd, and thus by the triangle of interlocking companies at the heart of Formations House. Nominee Secretary Ltd\u2019s director was the serial nominee Edwina Coales, born 16 April 1935. It is not known how Coales\u2019 relationship with Formations House began, but it is perhaps relevant that she was born 23 years before Ardern and that her surname is the same as Ardern\u2019s maiden name.</p> <p>Formations House has abided by the letter of British law, but successfully created structures that are all but impossible to penetrate for anyone trying to discover who really owns them.</p> <p>\u201cIf organised crime depends on financial secrecy, untraceable shell companies are the most important means of providing it,\u201d wrote the authors of a 2012 study of company formation agents, Global Shell Games. \u201cShell companies that cannot be traced back to their real owners are widely held to be one of the most common means of laundering money, giving and receiving bribes, busting sanctions, evading taxes, and financing terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>In the book, the authors tracked to what extent company formation agents in different countries requested their clients identify themselves before selling them shelf companies. In Britain, almost half of agents were happy to sell a company without checking the identity of the person buying it. If the agent does not record the beneficial owner of a company, then there is no way law enforcement officers can discover that information. And that is a problem, because the qualities that so endear companies to legitimate businessmen are just as attractive to organised criminals. Fraudsters like to obscure their identity and avoid liability as much as, if not rather more than, the next man. It is simply easier to commit fraud if you can do it anonymously, unobtrusively, and behind the protective cover of a prestigious London address.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Formations House has abided by British law, but created structures that are all but impossible to penetrate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe question for me is this: as a police officer, what would I like?\u201d asked Commander Chris Greany of the City of London police, the force that leads efforts by UK police to fight fraud. \u201cWell, I\u2019d like everything to be locked down tight, of course I would, but that isn\u2019t the real world in which we all live. Society wants convenience, doesn\u2019t it? And the price of convenience today is there might be fraud on the back of it.\u201d</p> <p>Formations House is probably no better or worse than any of its competitors, of which there are around 300 listed in the Yellow Pages, it is just more visible. Its address is so unlikely that few journalists can resist mentioning the Harley Street connection when a company such as Sherwin &amp; Noble, The LARN Holdings or ERBON Wealth Management gets caught up in a fraud prosecution. And that has left a paper trail over the years, showing quite how many people have been ripped off by companies created in Professor\u2019s Raven old home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ac3fee7b05f5856e1f902f33033c80389c014a11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac3fee7b05f5856e1f902f33033c80389c014a11/0_386_3745_4976/753.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Michael Kirkham\" width=\"753\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Michael Kirkham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>VAT fraud may lack the glamour of some of the scams laid bare by the Panama Papers, but few financial crimes are more prevalent or more damaging. Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) estimates that the UK misses out on \u00a3500m to \u00a31bn every year, from VAT being claimed back illegally. Across the whole of the EU, the \u201cVAT gap\u201d \u2013 the amount missing through non-compliance or non-collection \u2013 was estimated in 2013 at \u20ac193bn. That would be enough to pay off Ireland\u2019s entire national debt, with a few billion left over to help the Greeks.</p> <p>In the most common scam, shelf companies move shipments of high-value goods (typically, mobile phones) in and out of EU states and pick up VAT repayments each time. The first company imports the goods, and sells them on via a chain of companies, which charge VAT on every sale. The final company then exports the goods, and claims back from the Treasury the VAT it has paid, while the first company disappears without passing on the VAT it has charged. The fraudster has thus earned free money, without having to do anything but register a series of sales. To commit the crime, all they require are several shelf companies, with their own bank accounts and VAT numbers, so they can do business with each other. You can buy such companies from a number of outlets, including Formations House. On its website Formations House does not give a price for this product, but competitors provide similar vehicles for as little as \u00a359.99). It is a near-perfect crime, almost impossible to uncover as long as the fraudster does not get greedy.</p> <p>We know about the most famous scam to have involved 29 Harley Street precisely because the criminals did not follow that advice. Aoife Madden, an actress and the niece of a member of the Northern Irish assembly, and an Iraqi investor, Bashar Al-Issa, along with three associates, used one corporate vehicle, Evolved Pictures Limited (registered at 29 Harley Street), to invoice another for services supposedly related to the production of a film. They then tried to claim back \u00a31.5m in VAT and almost as much again in film tax relief, a tax break designed to encourage film-making.<strong> </strong>Their crime was to claim it without actually making a film, and to charge VAT without passing it on to the Treasury.</p> <p>\u201cFalsely claiming VAT that is not due is illegal, so we are pleased that instead of this film flop going straight to DVD, these small-screen z-listers could go straight to jail,\u201d said John Pointing, HMRC\u2019s assistant director of criminal investigation, following their conviction in 2013.</p> <p>The five did indeed go to jail, but they remained curiously naive fraudsters. While awaiting trial, they set to making a film \u2013 called, improbably, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrAWBjiAiF0\">Landscape of Lies</a> \u2013 in the forlorn hope that its existence would erase the crime they had committed by not making one in the first place. The film was shot on the cheap. Its Middle Eastern scenes had clearly been filmed somewhere in the Home Counties, and its star was ex-GMTV weather girl turned Loose Women presenter Andrea McLean. Madden and Al-Issa neglected to tell the cast or the director they hired \u2013 an ex-bouncer named Paul Knight \u2013 that they were awaiting trial, however. When the case started, he was left without payment. So he looked for compensation at their company\u2019s registered office.</p> <p>\u201cAfter about three months of trying, I thought well, I\u2019m just going to turn up on the doorstep, mate,\u201d Knight told me. The prospect of Knight turning up on anyone\u2019s doorstep is a daunting one \u2013 he is a big bloke, but that didn\u2019t do him any good in this case. \u201cLo and behold, you realise that the swanky Harley Street address was just a building with a few letter boxes. It kind of put the final cherry on the cake,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He had discovered one of the great features of a corporate structure, which is how totally it can distance the owner from anyone trying to track them down. Knight never got his money, though Landscape of Lies gained a certain notoriety and indeed won an award at the Las Vegas film festival. (The festival rescinded the Silver Ace, however, after realising it had given a prize to a feature used as an unsuccessful alibi.)</p> <p>If it was difficult for a Brit to discover that a registered address at 29 Harley Street was meaningless, it was even harder for a Ukrainian. In the early years of Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s presidency, investigative journalists in Kiev could see that a piece of state-owned land in a forest outside the capital had been illegally privatised, but they did not know who by. The lakeside property, which was near the village of Sukholuchya, was transformed in the years after Yanukovych was elected in 2010 into a luxury residence, complete with a shooting range, chapel, yacht harbour, outdoor barbecue area, and more.</p> <p>The owner was clearly rich and influential, but any attempt to definitively track down his identity came up against Astute Partners Limited, registered at 29 Harley Street, legal owner of the Ukrainian company that owned the land. Astute Partners was owned by Blythe (Europe), another Harley Street company, which was in turn owned by P&amp;A Corporate Services Trust, registered at the Liechtenstein offices of an Austrian lawyer named Reinhard Proksch.</p> <p>Why would a wealthy Ukrainian want to own property via central London? According to Borys Danevych, a Ukrainian lawyer who has himself struggled to identify the owners of shell companies while investigating corporate structures, a key reason 29 Harley Street was chosen as a base was that it looked prestigious, but in reality was just a front. Astute Partners had to declare its shareholder, but that shareholder was a trust in Liechtenstein, which does not reveal company ownership, so the declaration was meaningless.</p> <p>Ukrainian court proceedings last year showed that the actual owner of the property was Yanukovych, who was overthrown in 2014. Proksch denies any wrongdoing, or any connection between Astute Partners and Yanukovych, and in 2014 insisted the companies belonged to \u201cUK/US and UAE based clients and foreign investors\u201d. The Ukrainian judge was not convinced, however, and the court took the land back into state ownership. Proksch failed to reply to my calls and emails requesting comment.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On a recent Friday afternoon,<strong> </strong>I decided to incorporate myself. I registered for a profile on the Companies House website, entered the information it asked for, chose a name for my company, and paid for it \u2013 all in just nine minutes. Some 36 hours later, on the Sunday morning, the email came through that my incorporation was successful. Oliver Bullough was now sole shareholder and director of Crooked Crook Crook Limited (under which name I receive a surprising number of letters. Just the other day, I was offered corporate car hire). Crooked Crook Crook is free to conduct business, its liabilities limited by legal guarantee, and no one at Companies House asked for any proof that the information I provided was accurate. It cost me \u00a315.</p> <p>The lack of checks is not wholly surprising. There were 200 new companies registered last year for every one of Companies House\u2019s 3,000 employees, on top of the millions of regulatory filings that existing companies make. There is clearly no way such a small number of people can process this mound of paperwork, which is why the accuracy of the registry relies on the honesty of the people providing it with information.</p> <p>If registering a birth or death was this easy, the opportunities for mischief would be endless. You could create as many \u201cpersons\u201d as you liked, then use them to claim benefits, vote, register businesses, or apply for a passport, then kill them off if they got into trouble. The rights of companies are more limited, but the opportunities for fraud are almost as broad.</p> <p>From 2010 to 2013, cold callers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/mar/11/pantheon-realty-land-brazil\">harassed thousands of British households</a> with claims that land near the Brazilian seaside town of Fortaleza would rocket in price thanks to the then-forthcoming World Cup. The cold callers seemed plausible, and 600 people put up a total of \u00a319m. But, in 2013, the Insolvency Service stepped in, forcibly winding up a group of related companies involved in the scam, among them Pantheon Limited, and Pantheon Realty Consultancy Limited, both registered at 29 Harley Street.</p> <p>The only culprits the authorities could find were Ismael Rajabi and Ahmed Mohammadi, both from Afghanistan, whose names appeared on the companies\u2019 registration documents. They are real people, but Companies House had, of course, not checked if they actually were the owners of the companies, which they were not. The real shareholders vanished, taking the investors\u2019 money with them, and all the law could do was disqualify Rajabi and Mohammadi from being directors for 11 years.</p> <p>Some of the defrauded investors asked Chris Corney, a solicitor from Carter Lemon Camerons in London, to look into launching a civil action to recover their money. He advised them against it, since bringing a case would have cost them more than it could have recovered. \u201cLondon is such a free-for-all. We think of it as an orderly, well-regulated, law-bound economy, and you realise that actually it\u2019s incredibly laissez-faire. You\u2019ve got to run an awfully long way before the authorities will engage with you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yet Companies House\u2019s \u201cpolicy team\u201d insisted that this wide-open system was key to keeping Britain in business: \u201cThe aim of UK government is to not impose burdens of unnecessary regulation on companies, and risk discouraging people from setting up and running a business, the vast majority of whom are honest.\u201d</p> <p>So, if it is this easy to create a company, why employ an agent to do it? Simply, company formation agents do more than create companies, they also answer the phone, receive post, and do other administrative tasks. The Las Vegas fraud would have been impossible without the semblance of legitimacy these services provided, for example, and the proceeds contributed to the torrent of dirty money that pours into London each year.</p> <p>Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to cleanse Britain of this ill-gotten cash. His government has made it possible for anyone to search Companies House for free on the internet, and,<strong> </strong>from June, new companies will have to publish their beneficial owners \u2013 the people who really control them. That information provided will not be checked any more thoroughly than it is now, however, which leaves law enforcement agencies as overstretched as ever.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>So, are the company formation agents<strong> </strong>who offer these services breaking the law? Nigel Kirby, deputy director of the National Crime Agency\u2019s Economic Crime Command, told me his team was investigating several agents, though he declined to specify which ones, and hoped to hand evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service this year. He said prosecutions could be brought under several sections of 2015\u2019s Serious Crime Act. Among the new law\u2019s provisions is one that obliges professionals to cease a business relationship if they are unable to discover the true identity of their client. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do so, you\u2019re liable to two years, and an unlimited fine,\u201d Kirby said.</p> <p>If his team does investigate Formations House, however, it may come up against the same difficulties that I did in finding anyone to talk to. Company filings record that Edwina Coales, the serial Formations House nominee who is still director of 49 companies, lives in a flat on Crawford Street in central London. However, when I visited the flat, the man who answered the door told me Coales had died \u201caround two years ago\u201d. Danielle Ardern, meanwhile, has no registered address except her office at 29 Harley Street, where I failed to find her when I showed up recently.</p> <p>The door buzzed open into a grand, marble-floored hall leading into the depths of the house. A staircase rose up to the left, and pictures of Egyptian antiquities hung on the walls. A young man emerged from a corridor to ask my business, and then ushered me into a conference room, where I waited until a young woman, with long dark hair and a slight European accent,<strong> </strong>came to ask what I wanted. I explained that I was interested in what happened in the building, and she looked concerned. \u201cWe would normally require information in writing, you understand,\u201d she said. \u201cMost publications can be not very positive, so we are careful.\u201d She wrote down her email address in my notebook, told me her name was Charlotte, and showed me out. I emailed her a list of questions about her place of work, but she did not reply to them, or return the phone messages I left for her.</p> <p>And that left just Nadeem Khan, the enabler of fraud on a grand scale. We know slightly more about him, thanks to the prosecution of Nobre, the Portuguese conman. After Nobre was arrested on 3 December 2011, the money he had obtained from Allseas was frozen. But Nobre continued to live in expensive hotels in Mayfair and St James\u2019s, with the funds coming from his Wembley-based lawyer Buddika Kadurugamuwa. (In February, she was convicted on one count of transferring criminal property, but avoided jail.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/a-world-of-hidden-wealth-why-we-are-shining-a-light-offshore\">A world of hidden wealth: why we are shining a light offshore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the police informed Nadeem Khan by fax in December that Nobre was under arrest, Khan continued to deal with him, and only filed a suspicious activity report on 6 January 2012, the day he was visited by a police officer. According to the prosecution, Khan did rather more than just sell companies to Nobre. \u201cHis actions \u2026 were key in allowing Nobre to launder more of the stolen Allseas money,\u201d the barrister\u2019s opening note stated.</p> <p>Prosecutors said Nobre had paid Khan \u00a3160,000 before the funds were frozen, nominally to buy four shelf companies. In reality, Khan used that money to finance pre-paid credit cards funded via a Cypriot bank and thus gave it back to Nobre by an obscure route, allowing the fraudster to keep spending Allseas\u2019 money even while on police bail. Nobre appears to have thought that filing a suspicious activity report protected him from any criminal liability. \u201cWe assumed that it was [approved], we had the all-clear to deal with him, so we continued to deal with him,\u201d Khan told police,<strong> </strong>according to comments quoted by the prosecuting barrister.</p> <p>Khan assumed wrong, and was charged alongside Nobre and Kadurugamuwa. He died last year, shortly before the trial began, so the jury had no chance to decide the merits of the crown\u2019s case against him. However, considering the sheer volume of frauds that have been publicly linked back to his office on Harley Street, it is hard not to wonder whether he played a similar role in other crimes too. He presumably would have charged handsomely for these backdoor services, as he did for the London phone numbers, the fax forwarding, the accountancy, and all the other legitimate services his company provided for his clients. If he did, where is the money? And, perhaps more importantly, who now owns this business in the heart of London that some have used for fraud?</p> <p>Formations House Ltd is owned by Nominee Director Ltd, which is owned by another Harley Street company \u2013 our old friend Legal Nominees Ltd. Professional Nominees Ltd is still the secretary for Legal Nominees, and Corporate Nominees Ltd is still a director. The other director, required by law to be a person, is a 37-year-old Pakistani man, who plays the same role in 1,033 other companies. But the business structure has changed since this triangle of companies was created in 2004 to guard the inner sanctum of Formations House. Perhaps it was not quite impenetrable enough.</p> <p>Since at least 2014, 200,000 shares in each of Legal Nominees Ltd, Corporate Nominees Ltd, and Professional Nominees Ltd have been owned by Sigma Tech Enterprises, which is registered at a service address in Hong Kong. There, however, is no company with that name on the Hong Kong corporate register. The Formations House website says that any disputes over the company\u2019s privacy policy will be decided under Seychelles law, so the whole 29 Harley Street operation may ultimately be owned on an Indian Ocean archipelago, although we cannot be sure, since the Seychelles does not open its corporate register.</p> <p>Public discussion about offshore tends to focus on the Seychelles, the British Virgin Islands or Panama: sunny places for shady people; remote countries full of dodgy money. But if 29 Harley Street tells us anything, it is that offshore isn\u2019t a place, it\u2019s an idea. Formations House is about as offshore as a place can be, and our government appears powerless to bring it back onshore again.</p> <p><em>Main illustration: Michael Kirkham</em></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 April 2016.
