      "bodyText": "The scale of multimillion-pound pay deals still being handed out to top bankers was underlinedwhen Barclays bank revealed its boss Bob Diamond received \u00a317m in pay, shares and perks in 2011 while senior bankers at bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group also took home lucrative rewards. Most of the focus was on Barclays after the bank also paid \u00a35.7m to cover Diamond's tax bill and he was awarded more in shares which will pay out, according to performance, in coming years. His pay deal is likely to infuriate shareholders and pay campaigners and comes after Barclays was forced into an embarrassing row with HM Revenue &amp; Customers over two tax avoidance schemes that could have saved Barclays up to \u00a3300m. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said that the bonus \"epitomises how banks have failed the wider economy and got away with it\" while advocates for a fresh tax on banks, the Robin Hood Tax campaign, stepped up calls for a tax on financial transactions. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: \"The only tax Barclays pays seems to be for Bob on his bonus.\" Diamond's payout was revealed in the bank's annual report and accounts which shows that 238 of the bank's senior staff were paid an average of \u00a31.2m. The Barclays disclosures were quickly followed by Lloyds and RBS, which reported payouts of \u00a3820,000 for its 386 so-called \"code staff\". The complexities of executive pay mean that Diamond's \u00a317m total is reached by adding a \u00a32.7m share bonus (80% of his maximum) on top of his \u00a31.35m salary. He also received perks worth \u00a3474,000 \u2013 to cover items such as personal financial advice and chauffeurs. Another \u00a33.7m was released from a share scheme dating back to 2006 \u2013 which was deferred after the banking crisis \u2013 \u00a31m from a 2008 scheme and \u00a37.8m from a separate executive share award scheme. The American-born chief executive, who also has British citizenship, was awarded \u00a32.25m in shares under a long-term incentive plan linked to the bank's performance in three years' timealthough he could receive up to \u00a36.75m. There is also another award of \u00a32.35m which could pay out in May. The bank, which stressed Diamond was a 50% taxpayer, paid \u00a35.7m in tax he faced as a result of his relocation to the UK from the US to become chief executive on 1 January last year. Barclays, along with RBS and Lloyds, also provided details of pay deals outside the boardroom to comply with rules requiring disclosure of pay details of the eight highest paid individuals. Barclays said the highest paid executive was an unnamed individual handed \u00a35.2m \u2013 before an award of \u00a31.5m shares under a long-term incentive plan to take the total to \u00a36.7m. While RBS did not identify its eight highest paid individuals either, stock exchange disclosures show the head of the US business Ellen Alemany taking home \u00a33.6m plus \u00a3138,000 released from prior years and another \u00a3991,000 awarded in long-term incentive plans. John Hourican, the head of the investment bank, was paid \u00a33.2m plus \u00a3302,000 and another \u00a3939,000 included from prior years. In April he will receive another \u00a34.1m payout from an award of 15.9m shares, taking his total to \u00a38m. Hourican waived any long-term bonus award for 2011 as a result of the payout which was \"unusual in size\". Despite the row that caused chief executive Stephen Hester to waive a near \u00a31m share award this year, some \u00a3604,000 of shares from prior years were released to him on top of a \u00a31.2m salary. He also received a \u00a31.6m from previous years. Stock exchange disclosures by Lloyds revealed chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio was handed shares worth \u00a33.2m. His total pay will be published next week when the full annual report is released. Lloyds' top eight highest-paid bankers shared \u00a315m while nine of the top management team were awarded combined share awards of \u00a33.7m for 2011 and some \u00a314m though long-term incentive plans. Unions said they were concerned about the credibility of the industry. Unite's national officer for the financial services, David Fleming said the union would be \"seeking meetings at the highest level to determine just what the banks are going to do to earn the credibility they have lost in the communities they are meant to serve and support\".",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece has jumped the final hurdle in its marathon effort to prevent an immediate and chaotic debt default after it won sufficient support from its private-sector creditors to clinch a new bailout package. After months of wrangling, Athens said it could meet a deadline to roll over \u20ac14bn (\u00a311.7bn) of private sector loans due to be refinanced next week. A visibly relieved finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said 85.8% of bondholders had agreed to take heavy losses on their investments and a further 10% would have to comply once special clauses were triggered to enforce the agreement. Market traders hope the bond swap deal will at least briefly quell fears that the Greek crisis will send more shockwaves across Europe and beyond and further harm the global economy. French president Nicolas Sarkozy declared the Greek problem was settled and a \"page in the financial crisis is turning\". However, there were plenty of sceptics, including German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who said that Greece had a history of missing growth and austerity targets. Bond markets marked down the value of the new 30-year bonds issued as part of the deal. Sch\u00e4uble said: \"Greece has got a clear opportunity to recover. But the precondition is that Greece uses this opportunity. It would be a big mistake to give the impression that the crisis has been resolved. \" For bondholders, the deal means taking losses of up to 74% on their holdings, but European policymakers have insisted it is a relatively small price to pay for containing the eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Greece is now expected to enforce \"collective action clauses\" on any holders who have not accepted the deal. The deal will mean Greece slashes its debt burden and qualifies for fresh bailout money as part of the \u20ac130bn package from the IMF, European Union and European Central Bank. Venizelos thanked creditors for helping to return \"Greece to a path of sustainable growth\". Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, which negotiated on behalf of banks and investors holding Greek government bonds worth \u20ac206bn, said: \"The debt exchange represents the largest ever sovereign debt restructuring.\" Analysts gave the deal a cautious welcome but said deep problems remained. \"This is far from the end of the euro debt crisis,\" said Michala Marcussen, global head of economics at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. She said further challenges included decisions over the firepower of Europe's bailout funds \u2013 the European financial stability facility and the future European stability mechanism. Michael Hewson, senior analyst at CMC Markets, noted that a small part of the bonds in question, governed by foreign law, not Greek rules, still had to be dealt with. \"Questions still remain about the status of some foreign-law bonds, the deadline for which has been extended to 23 March, but it would appear that Greece is less broke than it was a few days ago.\" Under the deal, private creditors swap old Greek bonds for new ones with a much lower face value, lower interest rates and longer maturities, slicing \u20ac100bn off the Greek national debt. In 10 years, Greece's debt-to-GDP level is scheduled to match that of Portugal, but interest rates on the \"grey market\" have already reached 15-21%, far above Portuguese levels of 11-14%. Bond traders also moved against Portugal and Spain following concerns they will breach deficit targets for 2012. Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has signalled his willingness to battle with Brussels over fines on Madrid for missing the targets. Rajoy, who has attempted to tackle runaway spending by regional governments, said Spain's deficit would be 5.8% of total economic output in 2012, higher than its agreed target of 4.4%. Portugal is on schedule to meet deficit targets set by Brussels, but at the cost of a deeper recession, analysts said. Its economy shrank 2.8% in the last quarter of 2011 on an annualised basis as austerity measures adopted in return for a \u20ac78bn EU bailout took their toll. The economy is expected to contract by 3.3% this year. Last May, Portugal became the third country in the 17-country eurozone, after Greece and Ireland, to need a financial rescue. Despite the recession, which has pushed unemployment up to 14.8%, and numerous strikes and protests, the right wing administration of prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho says it will stick with the austerity programme.",

      "bodyText": "It could have been a disaster. Had Greece's private-sector creditors convincingly rejected the idea of exchanging their old bonds for much lower value new bonds the skies would have fallen in. Financial markets would have crashed, credit lines would have dried up, banks would have gone broke, the world economy would have headed back into recession. Some of these things may still occur, but not right yet. Greece has won itself and the rest of the eurozone a breathing space by sweet-talking and strong-arming a majority of banks, pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds to take big losses on their investments rather than risk losing the lot. This, then, was a triumph for Greece but only in the way that Dunkirk was for Britain. And as Churchill said in 1940, wars are not won by evacuations. Greece will now get its second bailout, and the \u20ac130bn (\u00a3108bn) coming its way from the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union will keep the wolf from the door for the next year or so. Even so, this is clearly not the end of the story. Firstly, Greece \u2013 whatever the government in Athens or officials in Brussels might say \u2013 has defaulted. It will have to use collective action clauses (CACs) to impose the debt deal on investors holding out for better terms. Secondly, the use of CACs will likely likely trigger payouts on credit default swaps, the insurance policies investors take out to protect themselves against default. A few months ago the prospect of payouts on credit default swaps would have prompted a forest-fire type reaction through financial markets, but the Greek default has been in the offing for months and there is unlikely to be any immediate knock-on effect. That said, now that the markets have seen that default can happen inside the eurozone as well as in the emerging world, they are likely to look for other possible countries that might want to welch on their debts. Contagion is the third big issue, with Portugal the obvious candidate to be the next Greece with its combustible mix of recession, high unemployment, punitive debt-servicing costs and a discontented population. Spain, where the economic news has been dire in recent weeks, also looks vulnerable. As Louise Cooper of BCA Partners noted , the price of the new Greek bonds on the grey market suggested that the country's private-sector creditors will see the value of their holdings drop by 80-90%, which is a pretty strong incentive to dump the sovereign debt of any other country seen as likely to default. Fourthly, the losses swallowed by the banks and the pension funds have an economic cost, especially in Greece. At a stroke, financial institutions have seen the value of their assets dramatically reduced at a time when banks are under pressure to increase the amount of capital they hold. An under-capitalised banking system is the exact opposite of what Greece requires if it is to have any hope of pulling out of its deep recession. This leads on to a fifth point, namely that even after the debt write-down, Greece's debts will remain cripplingly high. The brutal austerity programme that it has, reluctantly, accepted in order to secure financial help from Europe and the IMF, will lead to lower growth and higher debt levels. Even in the best case, Greece's debt is projected to come down to an unsustainable 120% of GDP and in reality it is likely to be higher than that. Finally, therefore, it may not be long before the understandable euphoria wears off. The issues of whether Greece will need further debt relief or will be forced to leave the single currency will resurface, if not perhaps for a while yet.",

      "bodyText": "Hopes that the US labour market has turned a corner have been fuelled by news that the world's largest economy added more jobs than expected last month. In a boost to president Barack Obama's pledge to keep cutting unemployment a priority, the US enjoyed th longest stretch of solid jobs growth in almost a year. Government data showed 227,000 non-farm jobs were added last month, ahead of the 210,000 rise forecast by economists. Gains in the two preceding months were also revised higher by a total 61,000 jobs, according to the closely watched non-farm payrolls report. Jobs growth has now held above 200,000 for three months running, the longest such stretch since early last year. Economists said the report gave clues to more strengthening ahead in the labour market, with a surge in temporary hiring and an encouraging slowdown in public sector job cuts. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist, at Capital Economics said the latest numbers added to evidence the US labour market had turned a corner. \"Overall, another very strong payroll report and there's every chance that March will bring more of the same,\" he said. The unemployment rate, however, remained at 8.3% as expected as more people came back into the labour market after not previously seeking work. The dollar strengthened and Wall Street opened slightly higher after the jobs report, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 23 points, or 0.2%, to 12,931 in early trading. Marcus Bullus, trading director of MB Capital, said the data would be welcomed by traders. \"After a week packed with good news, the markets will lap up these numbers like a draft of champagne,\" Bullus said.\"And with eurozone unemployment at record levels, the US has just added more clear blue water between it and the strugglers across the Atlantic.\"",

Market players are hopeful that the move will at least briefly quell fears that the Greek crisis will send more shockwaves across Europe and beyond and further harm the global economy.</p> <p>Here is a round-up of policymakers' and analysts' reactions:</p> <p><strong>Olli Rehn</strong>, the <strong>European Union's economic and monetary affairs commissioner</strong>, <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/12/174\" title=\"\">welcomed the take-up of the bond deal</a>.</p> <p>\"That contribution by the private sector is an indispensable element to ensure future sustainability of the Greek public debt and, thus, a decisive contribution to financial stability in the euro area as a whole.</p> <p>\"In doing so, investors recognise that Europe has committed an important amount of funds to this voluntary debt exchange and to the Greek programme to move forward. Indeed Greece's international partners have made an unprecedented effort of solidarity to support Greece in its efforts to restore sustainability of its public finances, reform the economy and public administration, and thereby to return to growth and jobs.</p> <p>\"I now expect the Greek authorities to maintain their strong commitment to the economic adjustment programme and to rigorously and timely implement the policy package. This second programme is the cornerstone of our efforts to boost sustainable growth and jobs in Greece; it is a unique opportunity not to miss. Furthermore, the success of this programme is a cornerstone of our comprehensive response to the current crisis.\"</p> <p>The <strong>French finance minister</strong>, <strong>Fran\u00e7ois Baroin</strong>, described the deal as a success.</p> <p>He told RTL radio: \"It's something that allows us to stay on a voluntary basis that avoids the risk of default.\"</p> <p>The <strong>German government spokesman Steffen Seibert</strong> said the chancellor, Angela Merkel, saw the result as \"encouraging\". He added: \"The high take-up rate among private creditors opens the way to the largest debt restructuring of a country in history.\"</p> <p>The <strong>Greek finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos</strong>, thanked creditors for helping return \"Greece to a path of sustainable growth\".</p> <p>\"On behalf of the republic, I wish to express my appreciation to all of our creditors who have supported our ambitious programme of reform and adjustment and who have shared the sacrifices of the Greek people in this historic endeavour.</p> <p>\"With the support of our official sector and private creditors, Greece will continue implementing the measures needed to achieve the fiscal adjustments and structural reforms to which it has committed, and that will return Greece to a path of sustainable growth.\"</p> <p><strong>Martin K\u00f6hring</strong>, an economist at the <strong>Economist Intelligence Unit</strong>, said the \"successful\" bond swap meant that Greece would not face a disorderly default when it needs to refinance around \u20ac14.4bn (\u00a312bn) of bonds on 20 March.</p> <p>\"The carefully scripted sequence of events that Greece and its eurozone leaders have foreseen to prevent a chaotic default and keep the country within the eurozone for the time being has worked so far.</p> <p>\"However, a successful debt swap and subsequent approval of the \u20ac130bn bailout do not suddenly solve the Greek debt crisis. They only buy the eurozone some more time to prevent major contagion to other vulnerable euro area countries such as Portugal, Spain and Italy.</p> <p>\"For Greece, the problem of lack of growth amid the deep fiscal austerity measures will continue as the eurozone rescue package continues to focus primarily on ways to guarantee prompt debt repayment rather than a medium-term growth strategy for Greece.\"</p> <p><strong>Elisabeth Afseth</strong> and <strong>Brian Barry</strong>, fixed income analysts at <strong>Investec</strong>, said it looked as if most investors agreed the deal was probably the best they were likely to get.</p> <p>\"The result of the exchange is as good as could be hoped for and the prospect of a disorderly default at the end of the month has receded significantly. It is not the end of Greece's problems though.</p> <p>\"The next 'event' is likely to be the election expected in April or May where the political commitment to the second support package will be scrutinised by Greece's European partners. And for the foreseeable future each quarterly troika review will be awaited with bated breath as the conditionality of the loans require not only considerable effort from Greece but also a bit of good luck.\"</p> <p><strong>Athanasios Vamvakidis</strong>, a foreign exchange strategist at <strong>Bank of America</strong>, warned that risks remained for the single currency.</p> <p>\"The May elections are a key risk in Greece. Recent polls suggest that the continued recession is turning the Greek public against the adjustment programme. The polls so far this year give an average of 41% to parties against the programme, compared with 37% to parties that support the programme \u2013 the rest includes undecided voters and small parties.</p> <p>\"We believe that even if these polls turn out to be wrong, uncertainty as the elections approach could fuel further Greek-driven market volatility in Europe. If the elections lead to a government against the programme, or no government at all, the shock could even have systemic implications for the eurozone.\"</p> <p><strong>Louise Cooper</strong>, a markets analyst at <strong>BGC Partners</strong>, described the deal as \"just one small step along a very long and difficult road which is still likely to end in a car crash.\"</p> <p>\"The new 30-year Greek bonds that investors will exchange old bonds into are already being quoted in the 'grey, when issued' market.

The take-up of this deal which is widely seen as 'the least bad option' means that Athens can force the majority of remaining dissenters to take the deal by enforcing retroactive collective action clauses.</p> <p>\"The overall aim is to cut Greek government from 160% (of GDP) to just over 120% by 2020. Whether this aim is achieved or not, only time will tell. However, 120% of GDP is still a level of debt that may be described as unsustainable and with Greece in its fifth year of recession and facing extreme austerity for the foreseeable future, it is very difficult to see how Athens can steer a course back to prosperity from here.</p> <p>\"Sadly, most commentators recognise that Greece is probably past saving within the euro. In order to survive, Athens needs to be cut free of its economic shackles, devalue its currency and gradually trade its way out of a hole.</p> <p>\"However, political leaders elsewhere in the eurozone who are facing domestic elections this year or perhaps head a weak coalition government are motivated more by short-term political wellbeing rather than the economic wellbeing of the EU as a whole.\"</p> <p><strong>Raoul Ruparel</strong>, the head of economic research at the EU reform thinktank <strong>Open Europe</strong>, warned that the deal could prove to be a \"pyrrhic victory\".</p> <p>\"With the use of CACs [collective action clauses] Greece has entered a coercive restructuring or default \u2013 something which Greece and the eurozone have spent two years trying to avoid.

At best, we expect a short relief rally in the euro, since uncertainty remains high and the market has already priced in much of the positive aspects.\"</p> <p><strong>Michael Hewson</strong>, a senior market analyst at <strong>CMC Markets UK</strong>, flagged up challenges ahead.</p> <p>\"Questions still remain about the status of some foreign law bonds the deadline of which has been extended to 23 March, but it would appear that a disorderly default has been avoided for the time being and that Greece is now less broke than it was a few days ago.\"</p> <p><strong>Mark Schofield</strong> at <strong>Citi</strong> says new Greek bonds are likely to remain under pressure.</p> <p>\"We continue to think that, while the PSI (private-sector involvement deal) has been a welcome success in terms of averting more near-term volatility and stress, Greece still faces significant hurdles in reaching the current debt to GDP target of 120% (and that is still 120%!).</p> <p>\"This leads us to believe that, while domestic Greek holders of the bonds may well retain them, international holders, particularly those measured against government bond benchmarks that do not include Greece, will be keen to sell them before they take any more pain.\"</p>",

At best, we expect a short relief rally in the euro, since uncertainty remains high and the market has already priced in much of the positive aspects.\" Michael Hewson, a senior market analyst at CMC Markets UK, flagged up challenges ahead. \"Questions still remain about the status of some foreign law bonds the deadline of which has been extended to 23 March, but it would appear that a disorderly default has been avoided for the time being and that Greece is now less broke than it was a few days ago.\" Mark Schofield at Citi says new Greek bonds are likely to remain under pressure. \"We continue to think that, while the PSI (private-sector involvement deal) has been a welcome success in terms of averting more near-term volatility and stress, Greece still faces significant hurdles in reaching the current debt to GDP target of 120% (and that is still 120%!). \"This leads us to believe that, while domestic Greek holders of the bonds may well retain them, international holders, particularly those measured against government bond benchmarks that do not include Greece, will be keen to sell them before they take any more pain.\"",
