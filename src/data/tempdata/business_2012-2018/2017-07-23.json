      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has rejected the suggestion that inequality is getting worse and attacked Bill Shorten for giving up on economic growth. Bill Shorten is set to announce a Labor policy to crack down on trusts and other forms of tax minimisation, declaring inequality would be Labor\u2019s defining mission in government. The treasurer warned sectors that use trusts including small business, charities and farmers, Labor was \u201ccoming after you\u201d, and rejected Shorten\u2019s central premise that inequality was increasing. \u201cThe latest census showed on the global measure of inequality, which is the Gini coefficient, that is the accepted global measure of income inequality around the world and that figure shows it hasn\u2019t got worse, it has actually got better,\u201d Morrison said. Asked whether Australians would feel they were doing better given low wage growth, Morrison said his objective was to grow the economy \u201cso they do better and their wages increase\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the way you address their problems, you don\u2019t address their problems by just jacking up taxes across the board,\u201d he told ABC. Bill Shorten hit back at Morrison, saying addressing inequality is a strategy for economic growth. He said the casualisation of the workforce, the penalty rate decision, increasing energy prices and flat wages growth were frustrating Australians. \u201cTackling inequality is a growth strategy,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cAustralians are worried that they\u2019re going to hand on a worse standard of living to the next generation than the one they inherited. Professor Peter Whiteford of the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University tweeted: Earlier this year, the OECD economic survey of Australia in April found \u201cinclusiveness has been eroded\u201d. \u201cThe Gini coefficient has been drifting up and households in upper-income brackets have benefited disproportionally from Australia\u2019s long period of economic growth,\u201d the report said. \u201cReal incomes for the top quintile of households grew by more than 40% between 2004 and 2014, while those for the lowest quintile only grew by about 25%. \u201cStrong growth has pulled the incomes of households with wage earners further ahead of households reliant on transfers or pensions, which dominate the lower end of the income distribution.\u201d Morrison acknowledged that while Australia had a long period of economic growth, many Australians had not felt that growth. Morrison said Shorten\u2019s speech showed that Labor had given up on economic growth, that Australians could not get wage increases. \u201cFor Bill Shorten now it\u2019s all about how he carves it up, not how he grows the economy,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cHe is playing heavily into this idea of envy and he\u2019s saying quite bluntly to Australians that he doesn\u2019t have any plans to grow the economy and he just wants to have a discussion about how it is divvied up.\u201d He said the Coalition view in contrast was to grow the Australian economy and cited 240,000 new jobs created in the 2016-17. Morrison quoted Shorten\u2019s statements in 2011 in government, when he said trusts were a legitimate feature of the tax system and were not a form of tax avoidance.",

The business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, will announce the funding, including a \u00a345m competition to make batteries more accessible and affordable, in a speech on Monday that should spell out further the government\u2019s plans to increase productivity and growth. The \u00a3246m, to be spent over four years on research and innovation in battery technology, is likely to have particular benefits in the automotive sector and renewable energy. The search for an industrial strategy was launched in January by Theresa May, designed to help Britain\u2019s economy after Brexit, garnering more than 1,900 responses from businesses and other organisations in a three-month consultation. A white paper is due later in the year, but Clark is expected to say of the strategy: \u201cFor all our citizens to be able to look forward with confidence to a prosperous future, we need to plan to improve our ability to earn that prosperity. To enjoy a high and rising standard of living we must plan to be more productive than in the past.\u201d He will also say: \u201cEconomists have pointed to what they have called a productivity puzzle in Britain. That we appear to generate less value for our efforts than, say, people in Germany or France. In other words, we have to work longer to get the same rewards. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we want \u2013 or need \u2013 people to work longer hours. It\u2019s that we need to ensure that we find and seize opportunities to work more productively \u2013 as a country, as cities and regions, as businesses and as individuals. If we can do so, we can increase the earning power of our country and our people.\u201d Investing in science and research was the first of 10 \u201cpillars\u201d of the outlined industrial strategy. Clark will add that the strategy could \u201cbring together concerted effort on areas of opportunity that have previously been in different sectors, or which require joining forces between entrepreneurs, scientists and researchers, industries, and local and national government.\u201d Professor Philip Nelson, chief executive of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said: \u201cBatteries will form a cornerstone of a low carbon economy, whether in cars, aircraft, consumer electronics, district or grid storage. To deliver the UK\u2019s low-carbon economy we must consolidate and grow our capabilities in novel battery technology.\u201d Richard Parry-Jones, formerly of the UK Automotive Council, will chair a board overseeing the investment. Clark will also confirm another \u00a325m to be allocated to research and development of connected autonomous vehicles, this time on schemes for off-road, driverless vehicles destined for construction, farming and mining.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asda is considering a move for the discount chain B&amp;M, in what would be the latest attempt by a major supermarket to diversify in the face of growing competition from cheaper rivals. A takeover of the budget retailer would be expected to cost more than \u00a34bn. Asda, the third-biggest supermarket chain in Britain, has seen sales dwindle in the past three years and could use the 500 B&amp;M stores as a further outlet for products such as its George clothing range. Walmart-owned Asda refused to deny or confirm reports that it was in the early stages of assessing a bid for B&amp;M, which opened its first store in 1978 but has rapidly expanded in Britain\u2019s years of austerity. It has stores on high streets and out of town across Britain, selling fast-moving consumer goods and non-grocery products, including some DIY and garden goods. A takeover by Asda would follow similar moves by other big supermarkets menaced by the rise of German competitors, Aldi and Lidl. Sainsbury\u2019s is closing in on the local supermarkets owned by Nisa, negotiating a deal that is expected to be in the region of \u00a3130m, a year after Sainsbury\u2019s bought Argos for \u00a31.4bn. Tesco has attempted to snap up Booker, the cash-and-carry that supplies Budgens and Londis convenience stores, for \u00a33.7bn, although concerns from the Competition and Markets Authority mean any deal is unlikely to be concluded before December. Asda has been hit hardest by cheaper competition, having positioned itself as the budget choice among the big four. Last year the struggling supermarket replaced its then chief executive, Andy Clarke, in an attempt to halt a succession of sliding sales figures. But the appointment of Sean Clarke, brought in from running Walmart\u2019s Chinese businesses, has failed so far to halt the trend, with Asda recently reporting a 11th successive quarter of decline. In its attempt to cut costs, it was recently named the worst of the major chains by the industry watchdog for its treatment of suppliers and in warning importers that they would have to wait longer for payment. Unlike Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda only operates large outlets, and has been unable to tap into the rise of convenience stores. Meanwhile, the likes of Poundland have started selling clothing, competing with Asda\u2019s George range. The B&amp;M deal could allow Asda to counter this latest incursion into its territory and compete with other leading grocers in local stores. B&amp;M was bought by the Arora brothers, the sons of a cash-and-carry owner from Manchester, in 2004 and has almost doubled in size in the past five years. Former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy joined the board in 2013 and a listing on the London stock exchange followed in 2014. It claims to have enjoyed its rapid growth on the basis of word-of-mouth, with virtually no advertising spend. Its revenues grew 18% in the first quarter of 2017. B&amp;M also owns 95 stores in Germany under the Jawoll brand. Last month, the Arora brothers cashed in nearly \u00a3230m worth of shares in the business, cutting their stake from about 21% to 15% and taking their total proceeds since B&amp;M floated to nearly \u00a31bn. The two, who live next door to each other and take holidays together, are estimated to be worth almost \u00a32bn in total. According to the Sunday Times, Asda has commissioned external research on B&amp;M with a view to a potential bid, suggesting that Walmart is now prepared to reinvest to prop up the ailing chain rather than offload it. As Asda spokeswoman said the firm would not comment on market speculation. B&amp;M also refused to comment, but is understood to have had no knowledge of potential interest from Asda.",

      "bodyText": "For Spreadsheet Phil, the numbers look bad. Growth is weakening. Higher inflation means debt interest payments are rising. The recent election showed a nation heartily sick of austerity. There are pressures for higher public-sector pay. The one big initiative announced by Philip Hammond in his year or so as chancellor was to move the annual budget from the spring to the autumn. Preparatory work for the first of those will begin in earnest over the summer, and nothing so far has suggested that Hammond will be in a generous mood. Quite the contrary, in fact. The chancellor\u2019s thinking is clear enough. Ten years ago, when the financial crisis broke, the UK was running an annual budget deficit \u2013 the shortfall between what the state raises in revenue and what it spends \u2013 of around 2.5% of gross domestic product. As a result of the subsequent deep recession, the deficit ballooned to a peacetime record of 10% of GDP. Since then, tax increases, spending curbs and modest growth have combined to narrow the deficit, but nowhere near as fast as envisaged. Hammond is worried about the economic implications of Brexit but he also knows that Britain faces challenges from a growing, elderly population. The demographic time bomb is ticking loudly: hence last week\u2019s announcement to raise the pension age for those born in the 1970s, and the disastrous decision to include plans for a \u201cdementia\u201d tax in the Conservative party manifesto. Had the Conservatives won a healthy overall majority in last month\u2019s election, Spreadsheet Phil would be out of a job. As it is, his position has strengthened as the authority of the prime minister has weakened. Theresa May would like a generous autumn budget but, as far as the chancellor is concerned, she can \u2013 to coin a phrase \u2013 go whistle for it. The first budget of a parliament tends to be a sombre affair, because governments like to get the bad news out of the way early. If taxes are to be raised and spending cut, the thinking is better to do it early than when an election is looming. Despite the government\u2019s need for the support of the Democratic Unionist party to stay in office, this pattern is likely to persist. Hammond\u2019s argument goes like this. There has been an easing of the government\u2019s stance towards the deficit since he took over as chancellor, with the date for running a budget surplus put back by five years to fund some extra spending on public infrastructure and a slightly less draconian approach to welfare cuts. Both the deficit and the national debt are higher than he would like. The Brexit process mean these are uncertain times for the economy. Abandoning the path of fiscal rectitude would risk losing the confidence of international investors, who would respond to higher spending and higher borrowing by taking their money out of Britain. Higher interest rates would be necessary to prevent capital flight, and this would nullify the effect of the fiscal boost. All that Britain would have to show for it would be a bigger debt tab that would be picked up by future generations. Critics of austerity say the government has got it wrong from the start. The order of priorities should have been \u201cgrowth first, deficit reduction second\u201d, and not the other way round. Fiscal policy \u2013 tax and spending \u2013 is a more powerful weapon when interest rates are at rock-bottom levels and should have been used more aggressively. Cutting back on public investment was a mistake that has only partly been rectified. All this is true, but slightly beside the point, since the chances of the government admitting that austerity has been a failure are precisely zero. That would mean telling voters that all the sacrifices since 2010 had been in vain, which would be a hard sell. On the other hand, voters seem to want more police to fight crime, more money for the emergency services after their heroics this summer, extra investment in the NHS and no cuts in funding for schools. If Hammond is to find money for higher public spending without increasing borrowing, he will either have to ditch government plans to reduce personal and corporate taxes or find new sources of revenue. One option would be for the government to embrace the idea of a financial transaction tax, AKA the Robin Hood tax. This idea, fleshed out in detail last week by Prof Avinash Persaud at an event in London, ticks all the right boxes. Persaud\u2019s starting point is that Britain already has a financial transaction tax, and has had one for more than 300 years. It is called stamp duty, which is levied on the purchase of shares issued by British companies, and raises just over \u00a33bn a year, half of it from citizens of other countries. Some trading activities are exempt from stamp duty and Persaud believes these exemptions should be restricted. He also proposes that the tax should be broadened to cover transactions in corporate bonds and cash flows arising from equity and derivative transactions. He estimates that this would raise \u00a34.7bn a year. One argument against a financial transaction tax is that it would lead to fewer transactions and so would not raise any money. Persaud said he accepted that the tax would change behaviour (indeed, that is part of the reason for having one), but that he had already made allowances for the reduction in activity in his calculations. If there was no change in behaviour, the tax would raise \u00a313bn a year. Nor does he accept that a tougher stamp duty regime would lead to a relocation of business. Liability for the tax would depend on where the financial instruments were issued and who owned them. A US investor, for example, would pay the tax on shares issued in the UK, but not on securities traded in the UK but not issued there. Likewise, a British investor would pay the tax on securities wherever they were issued and traded. Persaud, himself a former banker, thinks big finance is a bit of a racket. If a company wants to raise money in the City, the charges amount to 2% of the trade \u2013 a rate unchanged in more than 100 years. Put another way, all the efficiency gains since the late 19th century have been captured by those who run the industry rather than shared with the customers. It is hard to think of any other sector where this is true. The Treasury has always been opposed to a financial transaction tax, in large part due to its institutional capture by the City. Official attitudes would change, though, with a Labour government. Why? Because Persaud\u2019s presentation was organised by the Labour party and he was introduced by the shadow chancellor. While Spreadsheet Phil is looking for a magic money tree, John McDonnell has already found one.",

      "bodyText": "Isn\u2019t transparency on pay wonderful? You might struggle to find many BBC managers who would agree with the sentiment after the corporation\u2019s tricky week for harmonious staff relations. The publication of the salaries of those earning more than \u00a3150,000 a year provoked anger, recrimination and reasonable accusations of gender bias. The BBC\u2019s experience will also have sent shudders through many boardrooms in the corporate world. Unlike the BBC, none will have to give details of everyone earning more than \u00a3150,000; that requirement was an odd, and probably politically motivated, condition of the BBC\u2019s charter renewal. But about 9,000 large employers will have to file data on their gender pay gap by April next year. The figures will be in the public domain on an official website, hence the worry that upsets and rows at the BBC will be repeated among millions of workers, albeit with less publicity. Wariness \u2013 and outright scepticism \u2013 about the government\u2019s initiative could be seen in a survey of employers published by consultancy Mercer. Fewer than half the organisations thought the reporting requirement will make a difference. One in 10 disagreed with the whole principle \u2013 \u201cunlikely to provide an accurate view, and results could have a negative impact on firms which are genuinely being proactive in this area\u201d, said one respondent. Companies also seem to be dragging their feet. Only about a third had compiled the data by the end of May, but far fewer had made their submissions. Up to a point, one can sympathise with some of the worries. Equal pay, which is the legal requirement to pay men and women equally for doing the same job, can be unhelpfully confused with gender pay, which is the mathematical calculation of what men and women in the same organisation earn on average. It is also true, as many companies complain, that the government is able to hide behind the reporting requirement to disguise its own inaction. An effort to promote Icelandic or Swedish-style shared parental leave would probably do more to address gender pay imbalances than the creation of a data-heavy official website. Do such worries mean the reporting requirement is a waste of time? The answer is surely no. A blast of transparency in this area offers the best hope of improvement. As with Lord Davies\u2019 efforts to get women into boardrooms, it is only when the problem is described in detail that those in positions of power are obliged to respond. In 2011, a report by the former trade minister highlighted the lack of women in top jobs and recommended that FTSE 100 companies should double the proportion of women in boardrooms to 25% by 2015. The target was exceeded, even if more recent evidence suggests progress has stalled \u2013 but Davies definitely provoked debate and scrutiny. On gender pay, there ought to be a simple remedy against misinterpretation: companies can explain themselves. The same Mercer survey showed that 70% intend to publish a \u201cnarrative\u201d alongside their figures. That\u2019s good news \u2013 as long as the commentaries don\u2019t become an extended bleat about how the figures have been skewed by the disproportionate number of men in senior positions. The important thing is to describe policies to redress the imbalance in the top ranks. TSB, which revealed a 31% gender pay gap last week, did a decent job on that score \u2013 for example, by launching a campaign to attract \u201creturning\u201d women to financial services. Male-dominated IT companies, who seem to be most alarmed by gender pay reporting, should take note. Don\u2019t fret about sending offputting signals to female applicants; take the opportunity to lay out your principles and ambitions. As with the BBC, one suspects the initial shock of putting data into the public domain will fade. The first experience is daunting. The second year should be more comfortable, provided there is progress to report. So, yes, transparency \u2013 even when it is imperfect \u2013 is indeed very welcome. Sunlight is still a good disinfectant. Recent history tells us not to worry about inflation The United States economy has been expanding for eight years but wage inflation and the core measure for the cost of living have been surprisingly weak for four straight months. Britain\u2019s inflation rate was expected to remain unchanged at 2.9% in June but instead fell to 2.6%. In the eurozone, growth is robust but inflationary pressure is weak. To be sure, inflation in the developed world is higher than it was a couple of years ago, when the collapse in oil prices meant central banks were fretting about the risk of deflation. But the real story is of the long-term decline in inflation, which has peaked at a lower level in every business cycle since the 1970s. Britain is a case in point. After the first oil shock, inflation rose to a postwar high of 26% in 1975. After the second oil shock, the peak was 21%. The late 1980s boom and the first Gulf war saw inflation hit 11% in 1990, while the long boom that followed Black Wednesday never saw inflation rise above 5%. Even if there is a bit more to come from the depreciation of sterling since the EU referendum, the next peak will not be much higher than 3%. Modern industrial capitalism tends to produce low inflation because it is a system based on competition, which keeps price increases in check. And since the 1970s competition has intensified. The arrival of China, India and Russia into the global economy has increased the supply of goods, while companies have access to a much bigger pool of labour. Trade unions have been sapped of their strength. State monopolies have been broken up. The upshot of all this is that economies can run with much lower levels of unemployment than they could in the past. That is why the Bank of England is not going to raise rates next month and why the US Federal Reserve is likely to put off another increase in American borrowing costs until the end of the year. Central banks are right to be cautious. Deflation will be a feature of the next downturn. Applaud MPs who take direct action MPs last week turned up at the offices of controversial ticket resale site Viagogo, fed up with the company\u2019s reluctance to engage in a parliamentary investigation into ticket touting. Conservative MP Nigel Adams and Labour\u2019s Sharon Hodgson were sent packing \u2013 but even so they demonstrated their persistence in tackling the subject of secondary ticket sales. MPs have shown their willingness to take direct action in the past. Six MPs turned up at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse after reports by the Guardian led to concerns about working practices there. Those MPs were let in \u2013 and then accused the company of secretly recording their visit. Clearly, MPs love a publicity stunt. But actions like these should serve to remind businesses that MPs do not give up easily when their public is on their side. For this, they deserve congratulations.",

We have results from Barclays, which is the first time the bank has had to face the City since the unveiling of a date for its criminal trial \u2013 of ex-chief John Varley and three former colleagues \u2013 on charges concerning the way the bank raised billions of pounds from Qatar in 2008. Anyway, block January 2019 out of your diary. The newish Barclays boss, Jes Staley, will have been primed by his lawyers to duck this week\u2019s questions on that, so instead the City might take its first chance to grill him on his attempts to unmask an anonymous whistleblower, when Staley took a literal interpretation of Barclays\u2019 old marketing slogan: \u201cIt\u2019s our business to know your business.\u201d Which brings us to rival Lloyds Banking Group, which also has results this week and is currently in trouble over its response to the long-running scandal in corporate banking at its HBOS Reading arm (two former employees convicted). There, the bank took the opposite approach to Staley and ignored inconvenient accusations from its customers for years. Which just goes to show, these bankers are damned when they do and damned when they don\u2019t. Changing channels It is a week of channel-hopping for the City\u2019s media fans, with a packed schedule from the broadcasters. First up, on Wednesday, we have interim numbers from ITV \u2013 which is in a state of flux having just confirmed the appointment of Carolyn McCall as its first female chief executive. McCall, formerly of this parish, will join on 8 January from easyJet, where she has been chief executive for seven years. She will replace Adam Crozier, who left the company last month. On the following day come full-year numbers from Sky, which is playing a key role in a corporate drama of its own with culture secretary Karen Bradley deciding whether to ask the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate Rupert Murdoch\u2019s bid to take over the group. Then comes BT, which has ambitions of playing in the broadcast space, although it has yet to establish enough of a reputation to compete with its two rivals for airing fictional drama. Except when it comes to some of its accounting, of course. BT is still reeling from January\u2019s news that financial mismanagement in Italy had been worse than thought, increasing the bill from \u00a3145m to \u00a3530m. Summer results rush Apart from the banks and the media companies, there is a lot more to keep the City busy this week. Among the major firms reporting results are: the pharmaceuticals giants GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca; British American Tobacco and booze group Diageo from a related sector made up of other legalised drug pedlars; plus International Airlines Group, Reckitt Benckiser, Royal Dutch Shell and Anglo American from assorted other lines. This all looks like an outrageous imposition on the financiers of the Square Mile, particularly those of a certain age who were brought up on the City axiom \u201cSell in May and go away\u201d \u2013 a licence to bunk off work during the summer (only dressed up as investment advice) and instead attend client meetings at Lord\u2019s, Henley, Wimbledon and Ascot. Anyway, the City used to have permission to return to work after St Leger day, which, for those of you with jobs that don\u2019t involve getting kaylied at sporting events, is typically held on the second Saturday in September. Then came a change in the listing rules. In the old days companies with June year or half-year ends could wait until September to report. No longer.

Among the major firms reporting results are: the pharmaceuticals giants GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca; British American Tobacco and booze group Diageo from a related sector made up of other legalised drug pedlars; plus International Airlines Group, Reckitt Benckiser, Royal Dutch Shell and Anglo American from assorted other lines.</p> <p>This all looks like an outrageous imposition on the financiers of the Square Mile, particularly those of a certain age who were brought up on the City axiom \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/10780036/Does-it-really-pay-to-sell-in-May-and-came-back-on-St.-Leger-Day.html\" title=\"\">Sell in May and go away\u201d </a>\u2013 a licence to bunk off work during the summer (only dressed up as investment advice) and instead attend client meetings at Lord\u2019s, Henley, Wimbledon and Ascot.</p> <p>Anyway, the City used to have permission to return to work after St&#xa0;Leger day, which, for those of you with jobs that don\u2019t involve getting kaylied at sporting events, is typically held on the second Saturday in September. Then came a change in the listing rules. In the old days companies with June year or half-year ends could wait until September to report. No longer. Like many things in life, this barbarism is being blamed on the Americans.</p>",
