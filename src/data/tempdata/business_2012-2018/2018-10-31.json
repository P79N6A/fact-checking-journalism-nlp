      "bodyText": "A former senior executive at Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire has described the tycoon as a \u201cbully\u201d, in the wake of claims about his behaviour towards staff. Jane Shepherdson, the former brand director at Topshop, alleged that Green\u2019s behaviour in the workplace was \u201cworse than most\u201d and that bullying still took place in the company. \u201cThere\u2019s no question he was a bully, everyone knows he was a bully,\u201d Shepherdson said. The Guardian reported last week that several employees of Green who alleged the tycoon had sexually harassed or bullied them were given enormous seven-figure secret payouts to settle their claims. Green, who controls Arcadia Group, the owner of Topshop, has denied that he had sexually harassed and racially abused staff. He made the denial after the Labour politician Peter Hain used parliamentary privilege to reveal that Green was the businessman behind a high court injunction preventing the Daily Telegraph from reporting details of non-disclosure agreements with employees. Shepherdson, regarded as one of the most powerful executives in the fashion industry, was credited with driving large profits at Topshop. Speaking at a conference organised by the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday, Shepherdson said: \u201cHe was a dealer, he wasn\u2019t a great retailer in any sense, and knew very little about fashion. There was an awful lot of bullying and I think there still is. I think it\u2019s become acceptable in the fashion industry in a way it shouldn\u2019t be. But I think his behaviour was worse than most.\u201d Shepherdson, who became brand director of Topshop in 1999 and left in 2006, said she had to be very aggressive in her role at the cornerstone retail brand in Green\u2019s empire. Adding that Green would try to bully her, she said: \u201cHe would get very angry and shout a lot. And then I would get very angry and shout a lot. Every time I did that he would back down, bearing in mind I was in a very good position. It was really exhausting doing it. It takes its toll on you. You have to continue to be very aggressive.\u201d A spokesperson for Green and Arcadia declined to comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Be gone, October! Wall Street has closed for the day, and the month, with a two-day rally. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 had both gained around 1% as the closing bell rang. The Nasdaq jumped by 2%, driven by the revival in FAANG stocks. Slightly worryingly, the rally did soften in the last few minutes (like a chocolate in the warm hand of a trick-or-treater). And the monthly losses are still alarming. The S&amp;P fell almost 7% in October, its worst month since 2011. The Dow shed 5%, its roughest month since January 2016. The Nasdaq had a real month to forget, down over 9% in its worst month since November 2008. Here\u2019s an up-sum of today\u2019s trading in London, from Fiona Cincotta of City Index: The FTSE rallied for a third straight session on Wednesday despite a stronger pound, jumping 115 points after a dismal October. October is traditionally a difficult month for equities but the FTSE shedding 4.8% is a significantly larger drop than what we would normally expect. How the beginning of November pans out will be interesting. Of the geopolitical issues which have be weighing on the market, namely Brexit, the Italian standoff with Brussels over spending, the US \u2013 Sino trade war or the slowing global, none have been resolved and we also have the US mid-term elections thrown into the mix. Gains were broad based on the FTSE with Standard Chartered a notable riser following impressive results with profits surging 37% on last year. Standard Chartered reported a pre-tax profit of $1.06 billion, up from $774 million a year before and 9% ahead of estimates. By focusing on what is does best \u2013 Asia \u2013 the bank has managed to sharpen its competitive edge. Costs have been a concern in previous years, but the bank has shown its capabilities at reigning these in. Next fell following lacklustre results. The bellwether dropped close to 3% after results underwhelmed. The retailer confirmed that in store sales fell further in the third quarter, whilst overall sales grew by 2% thanks to a strong performance in online sales. Back in New York, tech shares are still on a tear - pushing the Nasdaq up by almost 3% today. By my maths, that still leaves the Nasdaq down 8% for the month. Good news: October is over, at least for traders in Europe. Better news: European stock markets have all ended today\u2019s session higher, clawing back some of this month\u2019s losses. Here\u2019s the closing prices: UK\u2019s FTSE 100: UP 92 points or 1.3% at 7,128 Germany\u2019s DAX: UP 160 points or 1.4% at 11,447 France\u2019s CAC: UP 51 points of 2.3% at 5,093 That still means European stocks have lost around 5% of their value this month. Could the worst be over? Possibly, but it\u2019s worth noting that nothing has really changed. All the factors blamed for the sell-off - from US interest rate policy to the Italian budget row - are in place. On the other hand, maybe there\u2019s relief that the earnings season hasn\u2019t been worse. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has a good take: Earnings are not universally strong and outlooks have betrayed some murkiness. But, on the whole, we have more companies beating earnings estimates than missing, and more than the average. Fundamentals are still strong but there are questions about earnings growth from here. So, if the US-China trade war pushes prices up (inflationary), and US wage growth picks up (also inflationary), does the Federal Reserve keep hiking? Or does it hold off, to protect asset prices? Wilson says: The stock market is telling the Fed to stop raising rates. Janet Yellen has come out to urge the Fed to keep to its course, but the signs are the equity market is highly susceptible to a more aggressive course of hiking. The Fed has been here before \u2013 the question is do we get 1998 Greenspan Fed that listens to the equity market, or 2007/08 Bernanke Fed? October was a horrid month despite the gains of the last two days. We could see seasonal factors support further gains into the year-end but the primary trend could remain bearish.\u201d The Dow is holding onto its gains, now up 286 points (+1.15%) at 25,160 points. Wall Street traders are doing their best to end October on a positive note. Today\u2019s decent results from GM, and strong ADP jobs figures, seem to be helping. October\u2019s volatility probably won\u2019t spook the Federal Reserve out of raising US interest rates again in December. Capital Economics expect Fed chair Jay Powell will pave the way for a pre-Christmas hike, arguing: Although the Fed is unlikely to make any policy changes at next week\u2019s meeting, we expect the statement to reiterate the FOMC\u2019s plan to continue gradually raising interest rates, with the next move coming in December. With the latest data showing that activity has continued to expand at a rapid pace, hopes that the recent plunge in the stock market will prompt a \u2018Powell put\u2019 are likely to prove misplaced. The US dollar is also surging today, making gains against emerging market currencies such as the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira. Last night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg hailed the company\u2019s \u2018Stories\u2019 product as a key future source of growth, and admitted Facebook has reached saturation point in \u201cdeveloped countries\u201d. Facebook missed analyst forecasts for revenue growth (despite pulling in 33% more than a year ago), but smashed forecasts for earnings. Wall Street is giving Facebook the thumbs-up today, with Royal Bank of Canada providing a list of five reasons to be bullish: Facebook stills owns two of the largest media assets in the world (Facebook and Instagram) and the two largest messaging assets in the world (Messenger &amp; WhatsApp); Our checks and management commentary suggest no material change in Marketer views of the attractiveness of Facebook platforms; Monetization of core Facebook and Instagram assets still has material upside potential and Messenger and WhatsApp are beginning early stages of monetization; Facebook\u2019s aggressive investments are improving platform security and creating future revenue streams; Even under pressure, Facebook\u2019s producing impressive growth.\u201d Richard Dickie Hodges, Manager of Nomura Global Dynamic Bond fund, blames US interest rate rise fears for October\u2019s market slump. Getting firmly into the Halloween spirit, he writes: \u2018The Federal Reserve remains the biggest, scariest vampire in the markets today. As it sucks the life-blood of investment markets with interest rate rises, the so-called \u201crisk-free rate\u201d becomes more attractive, the cost of funding risk rises and all risky assets must adjust to offer higher returns. In other words, they must sell off. \u2018But our Nosferatu is a complex villain \u2013 it cares deeply for its victim. As rates climb, it forces volatility into the stock markets, especially emerging markets with US dollar funding requirements that fear the higher greenback. It is this volatility that may cause the Fed to slow or pause the blood-letting in 2019.\u2019 Halloween is a time for fangs, so it\u2019s appropriate that the FAANG stocks are rallying in New York. With Facebook now up 6.8%, Netflix also up 6.8%, Amazon up 4% and Alphabet up over 3.1%, technology stocks are in demand. But this treat comes after a very tricky October, which saw tech stocks slump by around 10% during the month. Microsoft is leading the Dow\u2019s rally, up 3%, followed by credit card firm VISA (+2.7%), industrial equipment firm Caterpillar (+2.4%) and Apple (+2.1%). There\u2019s a Happy Halloween spirit on the New York stock exchange, as the final trading day of a brutal October kicks off. The Dow Jones industrial average has leapt by 251 points, or 1%, to 25,125. That\u2019s on top of Tuesday\u2019s 400-point leap, and might cheer spirits on Wall Street. But it won\u2019t fix October\u2019s bad losses on its own. The Nasdaq index has surged by 1.6%, as technology stocks rally. Facebook shares have jumped by 5%, as investors show they like last night\u2019s results from the social network giant. General Motors have surged by 6%, after beating profit and revenue estimates today. European markets are still sharply higher, as traders prepare for Wall Street to open.... Global stock markets is up 0.6% already today, thanks to gains in Asia and Europe. The MSCI All Country World Index has risen to 481.03 points, up from 478 last night. But October has still been a pretty horrific month for stocks. The ACWI ended September at 524 points, meaning it has lost over 8% this month. In points terms, this looks like the biggest destruction of value since the financial crisis of 2008. In percentage terms, it looks like the worst month since May 2012 (when the ACWI fell from 328 points to 297, down 9.4%). The US president reckons shares are going up again today... Boom! The FTSE 100 just nudged a new three-week high after a strong morning\u2019s trading. Britain\u2019s blue-chip index is now up 113 points, or almost 1.67%, at 7153 points, as traders try to shake off their October blues. Mining groups such as Antofagasta and Glencore are among the top risers, along with equipment rental firm Ashtead and banking group Standard Chartered (after its strong results this morning). Retailers are struggling, though, after Next reported slower growth this morning. Remember: The FTSE 100 started the month over 7,500 points, so it\u2019s still down 5% this month alone. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says traders are hoping for peace in the global trade wars: The unspooked celebrations continued on Wednesday, the markets wringing all they can from Donald Trump commenting on Tuesday that a \u2018great deal\u2019 with China is on its way, undoing some of the renewed trade war fears that had hit on Monday night. With basically every major sector in the green \u2013 spare a thought for Next, languishing at the bottom of the index following its latest high street woes \u2013 the FTSE could jump more than 100 points as the day progressed. That lifted it above 7150 for the first time in 3 weeks, the index scraping off the top layer of October\u2019s losses while coming nowhere close to mounting a full on recovery. Another reason for optimism: Canada\u2019s economy expanded by 0.1% in August, a better performance than expected. Newsflash: American companies took on staff at a healthy pace this month. US firms created 227,000 new jobs this month, beating expectations of 189,000 fresh hires. Services companies led the way, expanding their payrolls by 189,000 to the total while construction and manufacturing firms both hired 17,000 new workers. That suggests the US economy remains robust, and could mean this Friday\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll (employment report) is strong too. It\u2019s a little early for 2019 market predictions, but we\u2019ll make an exception for this one: It\u2019s a Happy Halloween for carmaker General Motors, which has just smashed Wall Street expectations. GM has also raised expectations for the months ahead, which should cheer US investors. Reuters has the details: General Motors on Wednesday posted far stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and said its full-year earnings forecast would come in at the high end of its forecast due to strong demand in North America. The Detroit automaker reported third-quarter net income of $2.53 billion, or $1.75 a share, compared with a loss last year of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 a share. Last year\u2019s quarter included a charge related to Europe. Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.87 a share in the third quarter, easily beating the $1.25 analysts polled by Refinitiv estimates had expected. Revenue in the quarter rose 6.4 percent to $35.8 billion, above the $34.85 billion analysts had expected. A quick catch-up on the markets: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100: Up 105 points or 1.5% at 7141, a 3-week high Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600: Up 5 points or 1.6% at 361, a nine-day high Japan\u2019s Nikkei: Closed 463 points higher at 21,920, up 2.16% China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index: Closed 35 points higher at 2,602, up 1.35% The latest inflation data has given eurozone policymakers a Halloween headache. Consumer prices across the single-currency bloc rose by 2.2% this month, the fastest rate since 2014, up from 2.1% in September Core inflation, which measures underlying price pressures, jumped to 1.1% from 0.9% a month ago. That suggests the European Central Bank is right to rein in its stimulus plans, and halt bond-buying at the end of 2018. However, we learned yesterday that the eurozone economy slowed sharply over the summer -- which might mean more stimulus is needed. Separately, unemployment rate across the eurozone was unchanged last month at 8.1%. That\u2019s the joint-lowest rate in a decade, but also much higher than America (3.7%) and the UK (4%). It\u2019s a grim day for UK butchers chain Crawshaw Group. The supplier of sausages, chops, joints and pies is falling into administration. This puts 600 jobs at risk across 54 stores, which could close unless a buyer can be found. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The Yorkshire-based company, which was founded in 1954, has been talking to investors over the past month but has failed to raise the funds it needed. It expects to appoint administrators later on Wednesday who will then try to find buyers for the business and its assets. Crawshaw has 42 high street stores and 12 factory outlet stores across the Midlands and the north of England. Full marks to the Bond Vigilante\u2019s team at M&amp;G, who have produced some spooktacular charts today. The first shows the remorseless march of US student debt, which has tripled over the last decade. Laura Frost, fixed interest investment specialist at M&amp;G, says this debt burden can undermine the wider economy. \u201cUS Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell recently warned about the ever-increasing amount of US student debt outstanding: \u201cYou do stand to see longer-term negative effects on people who can\u2019t pay off their student loans. It hurts their credit rating, it impacts the entire half of their economic life.\u201d Student debt also impacts the overall economy: as graduates seek to repay their loans, they are forced to make concessions to their financial consumption, leading to an ever-growing drag on the economy. They buy fewer goods and services and are delayed in joining the housing ladder, with many choosing (or having) to rent instead. On top of this, student debt sees the highest 90+ day delinquency rate of all US consumer credit.\u201d Readers of a nervous disposition should take a deep breath, before looking at the next chart -- the interest rate on longterm US bonds. After falling steadily for decades, it\u2019s started going up! Frost explains why it matters: \u201cThe long-end of the US Treasury market has often been described as a giant anaconda: it draws little attention as it sleeps most of the time, but the minute it wakes up, everybody around shakes. US 30-year bonds don\u2019t bite, but their moves can be as poisonous as they basically determine millions of mortgage rates, as well as the price that governments and companies around the world pay for debt. The 30-year Treasury yield has remained within the support and resistance level shown for over 30 years, rallying 6% over the period and giving investors a long bull run. Does the recent breach through this level mean that the anaconda is beginning to stir?\u201d Finally, a picture that might scare Donald Trump - it shows how US central bankers have struggled to maintain full employment, without triggering a recession. Frost explains: \u201cWith US unemployment at rock-bottom levels and the stock market at near record highs, the Fed has begun hiking rates in an attempt to engineer a soft landing: it wants to slow the economy enough to avoid an overheating, but not so much that it causes a recession. How many times over the past 70 years has the Fed successfully managed to do this and return unemployment (green line) back up to its natural level (blue line) without a recession ensuing (vertical bars)? You\u2019ll be scared after counting\u2026\u201d The slump in Red October has dragged many global stock markets into negative territory for this year. Here\u2019s a selection of the best and worst performers in 2018: Bovespa Stock Index (Brazil) +9.7% NASDAQ 100 +6.5% (US) Dow Jones Industrial Average (US) +0.6% S&amp;P 500 +0.3% (US) Nikkei 225 (Japan) -3.7% CAC 40 (Paris) -4.5% FTSE 100 (UK) -7.3% DAX Xetra (Germany) -11.4% Hang Seng (Hong Kong) -16.5% SSE Composite (China) -22.3% But there\u2019s still time for a turnaround. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: The markets are racing ahead following a very good session last night in the US where the S&amp;P, Nasdaq and Dow Jones all posted gains in excess of 1.5%. \u201cIt\u2019s now the turn of European and Asian stocks to join the rally with the FTSE 100 shooting up 1.5% in early trading on Wednesday and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index jumping 2.2%. \u201cThe latest rally means the S&amp;P, NASDAQ and Dow Jones are all back in positive territory for the year. The only other major index to share this status is Brazil\u2019s Bovespa index, up 9.7% so far this year. \u201cThe upturn in the market is positive for investors, although the main UK indices still have some way to go before they get back into the black. The FTSE 100 is currently down 7.3% year-to-date, and the FTSE 250 down 8.7%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says markets may be turning the corner, after a rough October: Asia markets managed to close out the month of October and post their second consecutive day of gains in what has been a pretty poor month for equity markets in general. This rebound could well be down to some end of month position adjusting, however there have been some indications in the past few days that we might be starting to see a bit of a short term base, with most of the bad news already priced in to some extent. American\u2019s can\u2019t get enough of Halloween, so Wall Street is eager to join today\u2019s rally. Here\u2019s the pre-market calls from CMC Markets: Dow Jones is expected to open 136 points higher at 25,010 S&amp;P500 is expected to open 18 points higher at 2,700 The FTSE 100 is continuing to push higher. It\u2019s now up 115 points, or 1.6% to 7150. Nearly every sector is up, led by manufacturers, energy firms, tech stocks and banks: Here are the top risers on the Footsie this morning However, this still leaves the FTSE 100 nursing a 5% loss for October (it started the month at 7,510). Despite today\u2019s Halloween rally, global markets are still on track for their worst month since the financial crisis. Figures calculated earlier this week showed that $8 trillion had been wiped off global stocks in October. Trade wars, the slowdown in China, tensions in the eurozone and Brexit have all encouraged investors to ditch risky stocks. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Smart money is running for the hill and this was the message which October brought for the global equity market. Global stocks lost over $8 trillion in October, a headline which suits the best on the Halloween day. Investors are refusing to be spooked on Halloween, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEX: With October containing as much red as the goriest of slasher flicks, the markets oddly chose to rebound on what would have been an entirely calendar-appropriate day to continue the month\u2019s trading horrors. Building on Tuesday\u2019s gains, the FTSE shot up 1.3% after the bell, allowing the index to cross 7100 for the first time in 3 weeks. It benefited from the market-wide shift in sentiment, which itself came despite further evidence that the trade war is hurting the Chinese economy, as the country suffered a slide in manufacturing activity. Overnight, China got the shivers, as manufacturing activity fell and the yuan was fixed at a new 10-year low to the dollar. Today\u2019s rally is welcome, but it\u2019s not enough to wipe out this month\u2019s losses. October has been particularly bad for US investors, with the main indices falling sharply. CNBC has crunched the numbers, and explains: After Tuesday\u2019s comeback, the Dow is down 5.9 percent this month, still its worst performance since August 2015. The S&amp;P 500 is off by 7.9 percent in October, on track for its worst month since May 2010. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 closed in correction territory, down 10.2 percent from its record. \u201cObviously we\u2019re in a correction phase of the stock market and I think investors have to realize that,\u201d said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. \u201cThe monetary environment has changed. As you can see, even with a 10 percent change in the stock markets, interest rates have barely moved lower.\u201d European stocks are all jumping - fortunately not with fright. Weeeee! The FTSE 100 is flying faster than a rocket. The blue-chip index has gained 88 points, or 1.2%, to 7124, clawing back some of this month\u2019s losses. Bank Standard Chartered is leading the charge, up 4% after reporting that profits rose from $557m to $752m in the last quarter. Retailer Next is struggling, though, down almost 5%. Next reported that full priced shares are up 2% year-on-year, but retail sales (at its high street stores) have plunged by 8.0% in the last quarter. Online sales growth has slowed, to just +12.7% compared to +14.8% in the year to date. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Halloween - a dark time of ritual, dressing-up, and trick-or-treating. But any children touring the City of London must make a special effort to scare investors; they\u2019re well used to shocks and scares this month. October has been a torrid month for equities. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has shed 6% over the last 30 days, even hitting a 22-month low last week, as global markets took a collective chilly bath. If you really want to make a investor quiver, wave a chart showing how world markets have lose almost 8.5% this month, wiping out trillions of dollars of value. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says there is fear on the trading floors: October has well and truly lived up to its chilling reputation, with stock markets around the globe suffering one of their worst months in recent memory. It\u2019s been a wild ride for investors and there is no guarantee it\u2019s over yet. Markets may have recovered their early losses and some indices may even be in the green for the week but volatility has not eased and that\u2019s a concern. But after a month of gory red, things might be turning. Wall Street rallied last night, with the Dow gaining more than 400 points. Stocks have strengthened in Asia too, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining 2% and China up nearly 1.5%. Thea main European markets are also up in early trading. There are still reasons to hide under the bedsheets, though. Yesterday, we learned that eurozone growth has halved. Later today we get fresh unemployment and inflation figures for the eurozone. David Madden of CMC Markets says this data could set the mood for the day, and beyond: The stand-off between the Italian government and the EU continues. Italy\u2019s economy grew 0.8% in the third-quarter on an annual basis, which was below the forecast of 0.9%. Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s joint deputy prime minister claimed the underwhelming update is a reason the government needs to increase spending, and in turn increase the budget deficit. The Italian situation could spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis, and given that the country has the third-largest government bond market in the world, the fallout could be enormous. Dealers will be keeping an eye out for the eurozone CPI and unemployment reports which are due out at 10am (UK time). The CPI rate is tipped to be 2.2%, and the jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 8.1%.

Janet Yellen has come out to urge the Fed to keep to its course, but the signs are the equity market is highly susceptible to a more aggressive course of hiking. The Fed has been here before \u2013 the question is do we get 1998 Greenspan Fed that listens to the equity market, or 2007/08 Bernanke Fed?

It hurts their credit rating, it impacts the entire half of their economic life.\u201d Student debt also impacts the overall economy: as graduates seek to repay their loans, they are forced to make concessions to their financial consumption, leading to an ever-growing drag on the economy.

On top of this, student debt sees the highest 90+ day delinquency rate of all US consumer credit.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Readers of a nervous disposition should take a deep breath, before looking at the next chart -- the interest rate on longterm US bonds.</strong> After falling steadily for decades, it\u2019s started going up! </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ddc125ec39bd3a70e71a8793612c7a4859a582c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ddc125ec39bd3a70e71a8793612c7a4859a582c/0_0_702_527/500.jpg\" alt=\"US 30-year Treasury bonds\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Frost explains why it matters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe long-end of the US Treasury market has often been described as a giant anaconda: it draws little attention as it sleeps most of the time, but the minute it wakes up, everybody around shakes.

The company will reduce annual investment from \u00a34.5bn to \u00a34bn this year and next, while reducing the stock of finished cars it holds and its working capital by \u00a3500m. It will also cut \u00a31bn in costs. The firm has implemented a freeze on recruitment and all non-essential travel, as it battles against falling demand. Unions were briefed on the plans before the announcement. However, JLR said no decisions on employment levels have been made. Des Quinn, national officer at the Unite union, said: \u201cUnite will be pressing JLR for further detail on its plans in addition to commitments on future models to be made here in the UK to ensure the carmaker remains a powerhouse of UK manufacturing and source for decent, well-paid jobs.\u201d JLR announced 1,000 job losses at its Solihull factory in April after British sales of its Range Rover and Discovery models shrank because of \u201cheadwinds\u201d from Brexit and uncertainty over government action on diesel vehicles. The company, which is owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata, also said in September that about 2,000 staff will move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in the West Midlands. JLR is facing a \u201cperfect storm\u201d from Brexit, new diesel legislation and a weaker Chinese market, according to the automotive expert David Bailey, a professor of industry at the Aston Business School in Birmingham. \u201cI fear we\u2019ll see another tranche of job cuts in the new year,\u201d he said, with Solihull particularly vulnerable to a fall in Chinese demand. JLR endured a painful 43.8% year-on-year sales fall in China in the quarter, which it blamed on slowing growth and caution amid the trade war with the US. Chinese sales accounted for just under one in every six vehicles sold by JLR in the period. The company has also suffered from competition in China, where rival carmakers are undercutting its relationships with dealers. A spokesperson confirmed that \u201ccompetitor incentive activity\u201d had an effect on sales in China. JLR has underperformed against its peers in the broader market in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Chinese car sales fell by 11.6% year-on-year in September, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The car sector in China is among the hardest hit by the impact of tariffs imposed as part of the trade war triggered by the US president, Donald Trump. However, JLR said it expects import duty cuts for European cars introduced in July to benefit it over the medium term. Global sales for the quarter fell by 13.2% year on year, to 129,887 vehicles, JLR said on Wednesday. The \u00a390m loss compares with a profit of more than \u00a3380m in the same quarter last year. Global revenues fell by 10.9% year on year to \u00a35.6bn, as sales declined across all of its main markets, including an 11.9% drop in Europe. Ralf Speth, JLR\u2019s chief executive, said the group had experienced \u201cmore challenging market conditions\u201d. In Europe, JLR faces \u201ccontinued uncertainty\u201d, he added, with increased regulatory scrutiny on diesel vehicles, the change to a new emissions-testing regime and the UK\u2019s impending departure from the EU. Speth has previously been an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s approach to Brexit negotiations. At a conference in September, he told Theresa May that a no-deal Brexit would trigger \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of job losses in the car industry. Speth also warned in July that a hard Brexit would affect JLR\u2019s plans for \u00a380bn in future investment. However, JLR is still on track to deliver its new Land Rover Defenderin 2020, a spokesperson said, after the last version of the model rolled off its Solihull production line in 2016.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s an intriguing idea the Financial Conduct Authority probably won\u2019t adopt: get the entire population of the UK to renew, or switch, its car and home insurance policies on the same day every year. Absurdly impractical? Almost certainly, but the proposal has been included for consideration in the FCA\u2019s study of how to shake up the general insurance market and one can understand why. As the regulator rightly says, there are \u201ca number of areas of potential consumer harm\u201d. One is insurers\u2019 common practice of whacking up renewal quotes in the hope that bored or unwary punters will tick the box without noticing they\u2019re being gouged. In the regulatory jargon, this is \u201cinertia pricing\u201d. The current remedy for policyholders is to get on the phone and protest, which usually produces a lower quote. The FCA would not be alone in thinking the carry-on is farcical. Its formal worry is that vulnerable customers, or even those who fondly imagine an insurer would reward loyalty as a matter of course, are losing out. Thus the radical idea of holding a mass annual purchase of insurance to promote greater transparency and competition. The FCA says it\u2019s how Hungary arranged its car insurance market until 2014. Companies could only change their prices in one week of the year and did so with a marketing blitz that concentrated minds. Hungarian regulators report that insurance prices went up after the statutory campaigning period was abandoned. One strongly suspects the FCA won\u2019t dare to be so radical. Even its discussion document worries that the most inert consumers, not to mention those who are on holiday or ill, wouldn\u2019t be reached anyway. That\u2019s before insurers pitch their inevitable grumbles about administrative burdens and the need to manage risks via flexible pricing. It\u2019s more likely the regulator will opt for a relative price cap or various \u201cnudge\u201d strategies, or do nothing. Yet there\u2019s a germ of a good idea in the mass-renewal approach. Insurers have punished loyalty for too long. A one-day or one-week window is clearly a non-starter, but an intense auction for business sounds an excellent way to deliver lower premiums and clearer pricing. The FCA should be imaginative and see if the model can be adapted. Retail property has a long way to fall Sales in the shops down heavily, online sales up strongly. Next\u2019s trading trends are not new, but the contrast is remarkable. Its stores recorded an 8% decline in sales for the third quarter while the online operation was 12.7% higher. For Next itself, it\u2019s not a serious worry because its online business is already large. The latest numbers produced an overall 2% improvement in full-price sales, which is respectable in today\u2019s climate for clothing retailers. More to the point, the traditional shops remain profitable and Next regards them as complimentary to the online offer. Many customers prefer to return an online order to a shop, for example. But the trends will continue to look horrible from the point of view of retail landlords. Every tenant with any flexibility is copying Next\u2019s approach of being brutal when leases come up for renegotiation. \u201cWe must ensure that we take maximum advantage of the many lease expiries we will experience over the next few years,\u201d said Next\u2019s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, in the previous update. For the latest batch of 33 renewals, Next\u2019s rental costs fell 28%. The country\u2019s second largest clothing retailer will have more negotiating clout than most, but the statistic shows how power now lies with tenants. Retail-heavy property companies, attempting to whistle cheerfully, tend to argue that the long list of retail failures this year has only chipped a percentage point or two off their rent rolls. But it\u2019s the solvent retailers that are their bigger long-term worry. The adjustment in the property market has a long way to run. Help to buy \u2013 the great executive pay subsidy Greg Fitzgerald, the boss of Bovis Homes, put it eloquently a few weeks ago. If help to buy, the government\u2019s support scheme for homebuyers, were to be extended, ministers would insist on new rules \u201cto stop you bastard chief executives earning all this money from government subsidies\u201d. In other words, surely even dozy ministers wouldn\u2019t risk creating another Jeff Fairburn, the man from Persimmon who was lost for words recently when asked to explain his \u00a375m bonus. But, no, help to buy was extended in Monday\u2019s budget to 2023, but the government did not request, let alone impose, a cap on executive bonuses. The personal prizes for housebuilders probably won\u2019t be as lucrative in help to buy\u2019s final years, but you know who to blame if they are.",

      "bodyText": "Jewel-encrusted bottles of champagne costing \u00a3115,000 have gone on sale in Harrods, at the highest prices ever charged outside of a fine wine auction. The three bottles of Piper Heidsieck prestige cuv\u00e9e \u2018Le Secret\u2019 Rare are adorned with a ruby, sapphire or emerald embedded at \u201cthe heart of interwoven bands of gold set with 510 [tiny] diamonds\u201d. R\u00e9gis Camus, the cellar master of the champagne house, said the bottles were so expensive because they originate from a \u201csecret\u201d batch of exceptional 1997 vintage chardonnay and pinot noir champagne. The \u201cMarie-Antoinette inspired\u201d gems and gold bottle produced by the French jeweller Mellerio dits Meller help lift the price. The winemaker said: \u201c[R\u00e9gis Camus] saw something unique in the wines of [1997] and rather than declaring a vintage, he chose to blend a small quantity of this cuv\u00e9e behind closed doors, secretly ageing it only in magnums in his private cellar. Now, 20 years later, the results are truly extraordinary.\u201d Camus said the wine \u201cturned out to be a masterful stroke of intricate finesse\u201d. He said it has \u201ca rare depth and complexity, with a lively citrus attack and a serene minerality\u201d. The champagne house said the wine has such \u201csophisticated finesse\u201d that they decided to approach Mellerio to create special bottles. \u201cMarie Antoinette is a natural link between our maisons,\u201d Laure-Isabelle Mellerio, the creative director of the 400-year-old jewellers and a direct descendant of its founding family, said. \u201cThe refined world of rare champagne instantly guided my hand.\u201d Once drunk, the buyer of the bottle will be taken to Maison Mellerio in Paris, where \u201cjewellers will transform the bottle\u2019s beautiful adornment into a brooch, bracelet or pendant, depending on the owner\u2019s wishes\u201d. Ten of the jewellery bottles are on sale across the world. For those with slightly less expensive tastes, 50 unadorned bottles are available for \u00a31,150.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest inflation figures released on Wednesday by the bureau of statistics revealed that petrol prices have risen faster in the past year than they have for a decade and yet at the same time overall inflation remains historically low. At such a time, the government might be tempted to pursue a short-term policy to reduce petrol prices, but ideas such as that from Liberal MP Craig Kelly to cut the fuel excise should be rejected outright. The September consumer price index growth figures showed inflation growing at just 1.9% \u2013 once again below the RBA\u2019s 2% bottom target. What the past few years have really shown us is the RBA does not have a 2%-3% target range \u2013 it has a 3% ceiling. Since March 2016, the RBA\u2019s underlying inflation measure, the \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d, has been below 2%, and yet the bank has not altered the cash rate since August of that year: And these latest figures will do nothing to see the cash rate change. Upon the release, the value of the Australian dollar fell marginally as the figures didn\u2019t suggest to anyone that the RBA would be about to increase interest rates to curb inflation. And given the bank\u2019s clear lack of concern about inflation below 2% that means we are a long way from any moves. The market is not pricing in any change in the cash rate out to March of 2020 \u2013 at which point it would be 43 months in a row with the same rate. The biggest driver of inflation came from the tradable sector \u2013 those items whose price is mostly determined on the world market. In the past quarter the annual growth of tradable items jumped from 0.3% to 1.4%, while the growth of non-tradable items fell from 3% to 2.2%: And a big reason for this is petrol prices, which have now risen by 20% over the past year \u2013 the biggest annual growth for a decade. And as petrol prices are always a hot-button political issue, and because an election is near and the current government is looking down the barrel of a rather sizeable election loss, naturally some of the less competent types among its ranks are screaming for something to be done. Liberal party backbencher (and it should be said long-time climate change sceptic) Kelly suggested on Tuesday the government should reduce the fuel excise by 25% or about 10 cent a litre. This would cost the budget around $3.5bn a year and would also cost the Liberal party any economic credibility. Firstly, it must be acknowledged that petrol prices have been rising fast, but we should also remember that just two years ago they were falling equally so: So why are they rising so quickly, while two years ago they were doing the reverse? It has nothing to do with the government re-introducing the indexation of the fuel excise (one of the few sensible measures Joe Hockey did in the 2014-15 horror budget, even if he completely stuffed up the selling of it) \u2013 it is all about the world oil price and the value of our dollar: Consider that since January the average crude oil price has risen by 14% from US$66/bbl to US$75/bbl, but in Australian dollars it has risen by 27%. Why has it gone up by more? Because in that time the value of our currency has fallen from US$0.81 to US$0.71. And with the current low inflation figures it has fallen even more \u2013 because ironically one of the things keeping the value of our dollar down is our low overall inflation growth which in turns means the RBA is unlikely to raise interest rates: When the value of our currency goes down it makes buying things from overseas more expensive. And yet the relationship between the price of oil and out petrol prices still holds \u2013 the price is a bit higher than you would expect, but not greatly: Indeed one way to look at it is that in September 2007 the cost of crude oil in Australian dollars was $85/bbl while the index of automotive fuel in the CPI figures was coincidentally also 85. Now the price of crude oil is $104.35 while the fuel index figure is 105.8: Yes, the petrol price could have gone down by more than it did, but over time the price of petrol is about where you would expect it to be. And while petrol prices are currently growing much faster than overall CPI, it is worth noting that over the past decade petrol prices in all capital cities have risen by vastly less than inflation: So reducing the fuel excise won\u2019t actually do anything to keep prices from rising or falling, all it will do is have them slightly lower than they would have been, but at great cost to the budget \u2013 at a time when the Parliamentary Budget Office is sounding an alarm that our tax base is shrinking. In July the PBO noted that because of better fuel efficient cars coupled with Howard and Costello freezing the indexation in 2001 the amount of fuel excise raised each year has fallen rapidly: Craig Kelly\u2019s proposal would only further erode the tax base at a time when we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in transport, which can be done by taxing fuel. Kelly\u2019s policy would thus undermine the budget bottom line and hurt efforts to combat climate change \u2013 so not just dumb, but dumb repeated. What about breaking up the retail petrol companies as suggested by Barnaby Joyce when he argued the divestiture powers to be put in place for the electricity sector should be extended to the fuel sector? The problem \u2013 apart from again it doing nothing to affect the relationship between the world price and the power pump price \u2013 is that while our retail petrol sector is concentrated, the Grattan Institute recently found that it was less so than in the past: The top five retailers control just over 80% of the market compared to 94% back in 2005. Little wonder Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims told the Financial Review that the issue was not retailers gouging customers but \u201cthe bigger problem is overseas oil prices and the exchange rate.\u201d Right now petrol prices are rising fast, but a knee-jerk reaction to them would be a terrible policy. And while things such as cutting the fuel excise may just seem like cheap politics, the cost to our tax revenue would be rather expensive \u2013 and would means further cuts to services down the line. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The BBC and Sky have called on the European commission to take formal action against Saudi Arabia over a pirate TV and streaming service that provides UK viewers with illegal access to content including Premier League football, The Bodyguard and Game of Thrones. BeoutQ, which started as a geo-blocked website available only in Saudi Arabia, has rapidly developed into a sophisticated international piracy operation. Set-top boxes are available internationally, including the UK, which also illegally allow streaming access to thousands of premium TV channels. The illegal service has had a surge in popularity after making global headlines for pirate broadcasting the entire World Cup. BeoutQ also provides access to other illegal streaming apps and its feed is now being pirated by other operations. The rapid growth of BeoutQ has prompted Sky, which operates in seven countries in Europe, and the BBC to support the calls for the European commission to take action against the service. The broadcasters have sent letters to Anna Malmstr\u00f6m, the European commissioner fortrade, outlining their concerns and backing a formal EU protest, or d\u00e9marche, to the Saudi government about BeoutQ. Sky\u2019s letter highlighted \u201cthreats posed to European broadcasters and rights owners by a relatively new, but rapidly growing, source of audiovisual piracy, namely the BeoutQ service\u201d. It added: \u201c[Sky] understands that [the directorate general of trade] is planning imminently to launch a d\u00e9marche towards the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia authorities regarding the issue. The purpose of this letter is to confirm Sky\u2019s full support for that d\u00e9marche.\u201d The BBC\u2019s letter, which also backs EU action, highlights the damage that making its content and channels available via the pirate service will do to its finances. \u201cThe availability of the BBC channels and content via BeoutQ\u2019s pirate activity will adversely impact BBC Studios\u2019 ability to license these channels to partners throughout Europe and also the ability of our European partners to sell subscriptions to their television services,\u201d the letter says. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cThe BBC group is committed to combating piracy of its channels and content worldwide and actively work with our media partners in fighting against piracy operating in the terrain which our partners hold exclusive licences.\u201d The BeoutQ service is transmitted internationally on 10 channels by the Saudi-headquartered satellite firm Arabsat, which counts the Saudi state as its largest shareholder, and also offers streaming. It was set up last year, initially pirating the feed of Qatar\u2019s BeIN Media Group, the owner of beIN Sports and The English Patient film studio Miramax. BeIN Media, which has 55 million pay-TV customers worldwide, has spent billions on the rights content including Premier League, Champions League, World Cup, NBA and NFL. The pirate service was launched when Saudi Arabia mounted an economic boycott of Qatar. This has led to widespread accusations, denied by Saudi Arabia, that it is a media weapon in its wider political dispute designed to weaken Qatar\u2019s economy. The UK broadcasters are the latest to turn up the pressure on Saudi Arabia to take action against the service. This month, BeIN Media launched a $1bn lawsuit against Saudi Arabia, and the Premier League and Fifa have appointed legal counsel in the kingdom to try to prevent the theft of its intellectual property rights. The Saudi Ministry of Media did not respond to a request for a comment.",

      "bodyText": "New Zealand has topped the World Bank\u2019s ranking of the best countries to start and run a business in 2018, ahead of Singapore, Denmark and Hong Kong. The World Bank said New Zealand had retained its position in its Doing Business report ahead of 190 other countries, despite not implementing any reforms in the last year. The UK slipped to ninth place while Norway climbed to seventh in a year when the World Bank said governments pressed ahead with a record number of reforms to business regulations and tax rules to support private businesses. Georgia, the former Soviet satellite state, retained its position at number six in the rankings, despite persistent criticism from aid agencies that the World Bank was rewarding a country with high levels of inequality, showing that a business-friendly environment is not in and of itself a means of alleviating poverty. Macedonia, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and Mauritius are also among the business-friendly countries in the World Bank\u2019s top 20 that rank among the highest in Oxfam\u2019s list of unequal nations. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development criticised Mauritius last year for acting as a tax haven and leaching tax revenues from mainland African nations. Singapore, often held up as a model for post-Brexit Britain, recently topped Oxfam\u2019s list of unequal nations. The World Bank Group\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, said the private sector played an important role in \u201ccreating sustainable economic growth and ending poverty around the world\u201d. \u201cFair, efficient, and transparent rules, which Doing Business promotes, are the bedrock of a vibrant economy and entrepreneurship environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical for governments to accelerate efforts to create the conditions for private enterprise to thrive and communities to prosper.\u201d The report emphasises the efforts by developing countries to implement electronic tax payments, speedy procedures for setting up a business and the low cost and ease of settling disputes. It said a broad cross-section of economies in sub-Saharan Africa carried out 107 reforms in the last year, setting a record for a third consecutive year. The region is expected to experience the highest population growth of any region in the world over the next 30 years, raising concerns that the most populous nations will struggle to feed and employ tens of millions of young workers. Rwanda, which recently spent \u00a330m in a sponsorship deal with Arsenal football club, carried out the most reforms in the region in past year, with seven, and moved up to 29th in the World Bank ranking. \u201cThe latest improvements in Rwanda, which has carried out the most reforms since the inception of Doing Business 16 years ago, included making starting a business less costly by replacing electronic billing machines with free software for [VAT] invoices. Rwanda also improved arbitration in land disputes, an area in which it is second only to New Zealand, strengthened insolvency laws to give creditors greater control and improved access to electricity, the World Bank said. Rwanda was among this year\u2019s top 10 improvers with Afghanistan, Djibouti, China, Azerbaijan, India, Togo, Kenya, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Turkey. Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank\u2019s senior director for development economics and acting chief economist, said: \u201cThe diversity among the top improvers shows that economies of all sizes and income levels, and even those in conflict can advance the business climate for domestic small and medium enterprises. \u201cDoing Business provides a road map that different governments can use to increase business confidence, innovation, and growth and reduce corruption.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "AA agency worker has contract terminated after breaking leg", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An administration worker for the Automobile Association who broke a leg while on his way to work has had his contract terminated. There was no accident cover for Alex Wright, whose contract for the vehicle breakdown recovery company via the Guidant Global agency was ended with immediate effect less than a week after he found himself in hospital and more than two months before his assignment was due to end on 31 December. The worker, who is one of hundreds of agency staff understood to be based in the AA\u2019s Oldbury office in the West Midlands, faces at least a month out of work and trying to survive on benefits while the leg is in a cast, with no sick pay or redundancy pay to fall back on. Guidant said it was reviewing Wright\u2019s case with the AA but could not confirm any details until that process was complete. It added: \u201cGuidant Global is committed to treating all of our workers in a fair and transparent manner.\u201d A spokesperson for the AA said Wright\u2019s case was being dealt with directly by the agency. It added: \u201cWe have a very small number of temporary workers and they are covered by the terms and conditions of their agency. However, we are committed to the fair treatment of all of our workers.\u201d Wright\u2019s case has emerged amid growing concerns about the rise in \u201cprecarious\u201d working, including the self-employed and agency workers. About 3.3 million UK workers are employed through outsourced companies. The TUC says they are vulnerable because they cannot challenge their parent employer when things go wrong. The union body also says that growth in self-employment to 15% of the workforce has been fuelled by an increase in sham forms of employment, where those who would once have counted as part of a company\u2019s payroll are treated as self-employed to reduce tax liability and deny workers their rights. Wright said his contract suggested he could receive sick pay after four days but he never got to claim it as his contract was ended. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about this for a while \u2013 what would happen if I got flu or was put on jury service \u2013 and finally it has happened,\u201d said Wright, a 31-year-old politics graduate who had worked at the AA\u2019s Oldbury office, near West Bromwich, since February in an above minimum-wage administration role. He was so concerned about his job that he emailed the AA to tell them what happened from the pavement where he fell. Once he got to hospital, he discovered he would be unable to go into the office for some weeks because he had broken a leg rather than just spraining an ankle. He said: \u201cI was immediately concerned about my job \u2013 before I thought about my health to be honest. \u201cI feel really insecure. It just takes a little fall and your job\u2019s gone.\u201d Tanya de Grunwald, of the employment campaigning blog Graduate Fog, which first highlighted Wright\u2019s story, said: \u201cAlex\u2019s case highlights the ruthlessness of the so-called gig economy, and how vulnerable today\u2019s precarious workers really are when something unexpected happens. The truth is that temps, freelancers and agency staff are only ever one slip \u2013 quite literally \u2013 away from having no income at all.\u201d",

William Sitwell made the comments in an email to a freelance journalist and immediately apologised, but on Wednesday the supermarket said he would be stepping down with immediate effect. Selene Nelson, who is a vegan, had pitched Sitwell a \u201cplant-based meal series\u201d looking at meat-free dishes. In comments first reported by BuzzFeed News, Sitwell replied: \u201cHi Selene. Thanks for this. How about a series on killing vegans, one by one. Ways to trap them? How to interrogate them properly? Expose their hypocrisy? Force-feed them meat? Make them eat steak and drink red wine?\u201d In a follow-up email, he added: \u201cI like the idea of a column called The Honest Vegan; a millennial\u2019s diary of earnest endeavour and bacon sandwiches ... \u201d Sitwell, who has also been a judge on Masterchef, swiftly apologised when the comments were made public this week, but it was not enough to save his job. The decision was made in conjunction with John Brown Media, the independent production agency that produces Waitrose Food magazine, one of the UK\u2019s highest-circulation publications. The supermarket has made a big push into vegan food this year and announced a new range of vegan products for its stores earlier this month, including vegan Christmas meals. In addition to his work for Waitrose, Sitwell is a commentator on food issues, hosts food podcasts and edits cookbooks. The heir presumptive to a baronetcy and a relation of the writers Edith, Osbert and Sacheverell Sitwell, the Old Etonian also hosts supper clubs at his family\u2019s 17th-century manor house in Northamptonshire. Sitwell used a post on Instagram to pay tribute to the rest of the magazine team and said he was especially proud of publishing a special edition of vegetarian recipes last year, for which the publication \u201crefused advertising from those proffering meat-based products\u201d. He said he had enjoyed working on Waitrose Food for the last two decades and reiterated his \u201capology to any food and life-loving vegan who was genuinely offended by remarks written by me as an ill-judged joke in a private email and now widely reported\u201d. A Waitrose spokesman said: \u201cIn the light of William\u2019s recent email remarks, we\u2019ve told John Brown Media that we believe this is the right and proper move. We will be working with them to appoint a new editor for the magazine. We have had a relationship with William for almost 20 years and are grateful for his contribution to our business over that time.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2018 to make clear that William Sitwell is a relation, not a descendant, of the writers Edith, Osbert and Sacheverell Sitwell.",

      "bodyText": "Up to 800 retail jobs are at risk as butchery chain Crawshaw Group collapses into administration and Mothercare cuts head office job amid tough times on the UK high street. Up to 54 stores employing 600 people could close if a buyer for Crawshaw Group cannot be found. The Yorkshire-based company, which was founded in 1954, expected to appoint administrators on Wednesday who will try to find buyers for the business and its assets. Crawshaw has 42 high street shops and 12 factory outlets across the Midlands and north of England. It has been talking to investors for the past month but has failed to raise the funds it needed to survive in its current form. Ranjit Singh Boparan, the entrepreneur known as the \u201cchicken king\u201d, is the biggest shareholder with a 29.7% stake in the business and is an adviser to the board. His 2 Sisters Food Group also supplies Crawshaw. The butchery chain\u2019s problems come as Mothercare consults about redundancy with 200 people at its head office as it cuts costs and adapts after winning approval from creditors to close up to 60 of its 137 stores. About a third of those stores have already closed with the rest expected to do so in the new year. All the head office staff are involved in business-wide operations such as buying and marketing, The company said 50 roles were being created and it is hoped some of those involved in the consultation will be able to move post. A spokesperson for the company said the move was part of its effort to create a sustainable, global brand with an \u201cefficient and effective central business services from our head office\u201d. It said the UK retail chain would operate in a similar way to its international franchise businesses with \u201cautonomy to focus its offer on an in-depth specialist knowledge of its domestic market\u201d. Like other high street retailers, Crawshaw and Mothercare have been hit by rising rents, higher business rates and fragile consumer confidence in the run-up to Brexit. Crawshaw has also faced increased competition from Aldi and Lidl, which are putting pressure on the big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 to cut prices. Mothercare is also under pressure from the supermarkets as well as online specialists including Amazon and high street retailers from Next to Primark. This week, statistics from the Insolvency Service, a government agency, showed the biggest rise in company insolvencies since the depths of the financial crisis. Analysts said the 19.3% year-on-year rise in the third quarter was linked to the struggles on the high street. Crawshaw follows Evans Cycles, House of Fraser, Toys R Us and Maplin into administration while a string of other well-known high street names have closed dozens of stores via an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement. Martin Lane, the managing editor of money.co.uk, said: \u201cWith the rise of competition from budget supermarkets offering cheap meat options it\u2019s hard for butchers to survive. \u201cIt is undoubtedly distressing news for employees of Crawshaw and their families especially because their fates are now being kept in limbo. Now is the time to check what redundancy rights you have and dig out any income or mortgage protection policies you hold just in case.\u201d Half-year results released a month ago showed Crawshaw\u2019s losses before tax widened to \u00a31.7m in the six months to 29 July, from \u00a31.2m, as like-for-like sales slumped 13% and customer numbers dropped 9.1%. In May, the firm appointed a new chief executive, Jim Viggars, and in July it appointed a new finance chief, Nick Taylor, to turn the business around. The new management team said the group had expanded too quickly, failed to deal with the decline in the high street stores\u2019 performance and mishandled staffing. Shares in the Aim-listed company have been suspended.",

      "bodyText": "Fastjet, the low-cost African airline, has warned that it will go bust unless it can raise more money or reach an agreement with key creditors in the coming days. It is the latest in a series of warnings from the airline, which was set up in 2012 with the backing of easyJet\u2019s founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. The company has been talking with shareholders and creditors for months and warned in late September it would need more funds by the end of October to continue operating. However, it said on Wednesday that it is able to keep operating into November due to \u201csome improvement in trading and cash generation\u201d, giving it more time to hammer out a deal with investors and lenders. Fastjet said: \u201cWhilst discussions to date with certain shareholders and creditors have been positive, discussions are ongoing and there can be no guarantee of a successful outcome. If the company is unable to carry out an equity fundraise and/or reach an agreement with its key creditors in the coming days, the group would be unable to continue trading as a going concern.\u201d As of 24 October, the group had cash of $3.4m (\u00a32.7m), of which $2.7m is locked up in Zimbabwe. Several European budget airlines have collapsed in recent weeks, including Cypriot carrier Cobalt and Denmark\u2019s Primera Air. The aviation industry is struggling with rising fuel costs, overcapacity and falling consumer demand. Fastjet launched in Tanzania and expanded into South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, Uganda, Malawi and Kenya, with the goal of becoming a pan-African budget carrier. But it has run up losses, struggling with the continent\u2019s banking infrastructure, overambitious plane orders and office costs. It has never carried more than 1m passengers a year. Haji-Ioannou, who owned the Fastjet brand until last year, fell out with the company\u2019s management two years ago and forced the firm to dismiss its chief executive, Ed Winter. Shares in the group slumped 25% to 1.75p.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The property developer behind the conversion of central London\u2019s Centre Point office skyscraper into multimillion-pound luxury apartments has given up trying to sell the flats after receiving too many \u201cdetached from reality\u201d lowball offers. Mike Hussey, chief executive of the developer Almacantar, said the company had decided to halt formal sales of the flats in the 1960s brutalist tower, now called Centre Point Residences, rather than slash prices. The company said concerns about Brexit and possible tax increases on overseas investors were encouraging potential buyers to make offers well below the asking price. The decision to halt sales means about half of the tower\u2019s 82 flats, which range from \u00a31.8m for a small one-bedroom apartment to \u00a355m for the two-storey five-bedroom penthouse, will now lie empty, adding to a glut of unsold ultra-luxury property across London. Hussey said there was still interest from buyers, but \u201coffers are now reflecting uncertainty on potential changes to stamp duty, taxation of overseas investors and other fiscal policy proposals\u201d. He added that because Almacantar had sold half of the apartments, cleared the debts run up by construction and leased the retail space at the bottom of the tower \u201cwe see no point in chasing a market that is increasingly detached from reality\u201d. Increasing numbers of luxury London flats are now proving hard to sell. All 10 of the \u00a330m-\u00a350m apartments towards the top of the Shard have been empty since the tower was completed six years ago after its owners, led by the Qatari royal family, failed to achieve high enough offers. More than half of the 1,900 ultra-luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, adding to fears that the capital would be left with dozens of \u201cposh ghost towers\u201d. The swanky \u00a31m-plus flats, complete with private gyms, swimming pools and cinema rooms, are lying empty as hundreds of thousands of would-be first-time buyers struggle to find an affordable home. It is not the first time that Centre Point has failed to find occupiers. When the tower was completed in 1966 it did not attract enough high-paying office tenants and remained vacant for a decade, leading to it to be nicknamed \u201cLondon\u2019s empty skyscraper\u201d. Homelessness campaigners staged an occupation of the tower in 1974 to highlight the problem and the tower then lent its name to homelessness charity CentrePoint. \u201cNow its happening all over again \u2013 Centre Point\u2019s redevelopers have taken fright at Brexit jitters and decided many of its luxury apartments must remain empty again,\u201d said Chris Bailey, campaign manager of charity Action on Empty Homes. He added: \u201cThere are over 20,000 long-term empty homes in London, while over 50% of the 79,880 families and 123,230 children in temporary accommodation in England are in London, costing London\u2019s councils hundreds of millions a year. London can\u2019t keep on funding this while land is gobbled up to build empty towers for an increasingly speculative global market which now appears to be faltering before the spectre of Brexit price dips.\u201d The drop in confidence among buyers appears to have caught Almacantar by surprise as the tower\u2019s development team were very confident that all of the flats would be snapped up in short order when they gave the Guardian a tour of the tower this summer. Kathrin Hersel, Centre Point\u2019s property director, said the duplex penthouse spanning the 32nd and 33rd floors would sell itself. \u201cThere are plenty of people in the world who could afford it,\u201d she said. That penthouse features five ensuite bathrooms and a wraparound terrace with a vista across all of London taking in St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and beyond to Surrey Hills on a good day. Almacantar had even sold one \u00a35m two-bedroom apartment to the parents of a Chinese student about to start studying at UCL. Hussey said Almacantar, which is part-owned by Italy\u2019s billionaire Agnelli family, might relaunch sales after a Brexit deal had been agreed. \u201cWhen buyers feel more confident about the wider macro situation, they will also feel more confident about paying these prices again,\u201d he told the trade magazine Estates Gazette. Hussey declined to speak to the Guardian. Almacantar has told its estate agents at Knight Frank and CBRE to stand down. Mark Collins, chairman of CBRE, said: \u201cCentre Point Residences is a beautifully executed project that we believe will have enduring appeal in the market.\u201d He added they would be ready to try selling again next year when there was \u201ca clear runway ahead\u201d. Henry Pryor, an independent luxury property buying agent, said rich overseas buyers were very concerned about the risk of overpaying for central London properties particularly if the economy suffered in the wake of a disorderly Brexit or if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister and introduced a wealth tax. He said: \u201cThe wealthy are far more worried about the risk of a Corbyn-led government than even the hardest of Brexits.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Chinese economy has revealed fresh signs of the pressure of a trade war with the US and a wider slowdown at home as manufacturing activity fell and the yuan was fixed at a new 10-year low to the dollar. China\u2019s manufacturing sector barely expanded in October as both domestic and external demand ebbed, according to a closely watched metric released on Wednesday. The official purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) fell to 50.2 in October, the lowest since July 2016 and down from 50.8 in September. A figure below 50 represents a contraction. New export orders, an indicator of future activity, contracted for a fifth straight month and at the fastest pace in at least a year. The figures suggest a further slowing in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and could prompt more policy support from Beijing on top of a raft of recent initiatives. The moves have included pumping tens of billions of dollars into the financial system and other measures to prop up local shares. Raymond Yeung, chief economist for China at ANZ, said he expected more measures, including cutting the amount of capital banks are required to hold in reserve in order to ease liquidity. \u201cAll the numbers from China\u2019s PMI release today confirm a broad-based decline in economic activity,\u201d said adding that conditions for the private sector was \u201cmuch worse\u201d than headline data suggested. \u201cThe government\u2019s priority is to avoid a financial blow-up.\u201d In a further sign of stresses in the economy, the central bank fixed the yuan lower at 6.9646 per US dollar compared with 6.9574 one day earlier. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) allows the yuan to move 2% either side of the fix and it drifted slightly lower in subsequent trading on Wednesday. The move will increase tensions with the Trump administration, which has come close to accusing China of currency manipulation after the yuan has fallen in value and made exports more competitive. The rate is creeping ever closer to the 7 yuan mark \u2013 a level regarded as unthinkable three years ago when Beijing succeeded in cementing the yuan\u2019s place as one of the world\u2019s reserve currencies. A falling yuan will make the country\u2019s exports cheaper and possibly offset the impact of US tariffs, but it will also accelerate capital flight and put downward pressure on asset prices in China such as property. However, in a sign that China may be ready to see its currency fall further, the China Daily said on Wednesday that allowing the exchange rate to float more freely could be a \u201cwise choice for China, against the backdrop of trade conflicts and economic downside risks. Capital Economics said this week that it \u201cdid not expect the PBOC to hold the line at 7.0 indefinitely\u201d. October is the first full month after the latest US tariffs went into effect. Washington and Beijing slapped additional tariffs on each other\u2019s goods on 24 September, and Donald Trump has threatened to hit China with more duties. China\u2019s economy grew at its weakest pace since the global financial crisis in the third quarter, as manufacturing output and infrastructure investment slowed. Analysts believe business conditions will get worse before getting better. Shares in Shanghai were up 1% on Wednesday in line with markets across Asia Pacific where the Bank of Japan kept rates steady, reinforcing views the central bank is in no rush to trim its massive stimulus.",
