      "bodyText": "The prospect of a UK interest rate cut next week was virtually confirmed on Tuesday after a key member of the Bank of England\u2019s policymaking committee warned the economy was in a worse state than he expected just a week ago. In a sudden U-turn from his previous stance, Dr Martin Weale, one of the more hawkish members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, suggested in an interview with the Financial Times (\u00a3) that he was likely to vote for further stimulus measures. On 18 July, Weale said in a speech there was not enough evidence that the economy was suffering from the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Weale\u2019s change of heart followed Friday\u2019s poor UK services and manufacturing PMI survey, showing firms suffering falling orders and demand in July. The survey suggested the UK economy was on course to shrink by 0.4% in the third quarter unless conditions improved, according to the report\u2019s compliers, Markit. Weale said that last Friday\u2019s PMIs were \u201ca lot worse than I had thought\u201d and showed \u201cexpectations have worsened sharply\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are the best short-term indicator we have at the moment. I certainly feel they are very material for the decision we\u2019ll be taking next week. \u201cI see things rather differently from what I would have done had we not had those numbers and the material point is that they were collected after 12 July, so after the initial shock of the referendum. \u201cWhat I said last week is that I would like more information as well as more reflection and I have had more information. Although you can\u2019t say there\u2019s a clear signal, if you spend all the time waiting for a clear signal, it never comes.\u201d Weale\u2019s comments sent the pound sharply down to a two-week low of $1.3060 although it later recovered some ground to trade at $1.3127, down 0.1% on the day. At this month\u2019s MPC meeting, only one member of the committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, voted to cut interest rates. In light of the slowdown in the economy, a majority of analysts polled by Reuters had already expected a rate cut and some believe the Bank could restart its \u00a3375bn quantitative easing or bond buying programme. Jeremy Cook of World First said: \u201cWe are maintaining our call for a Bank of England interest rate cut by 25 basis points and an increase in QE by somewhere between \u00a350bn and \u00a375bn.\u201d Meanwhile, the Federation of Small Business warned the Bank to consider the consequences of cutting rates after the Guardian revealed that high street bank NatWest - owned by Royal Bank of Scotland - had warned business customers it might impose negative rates and charge customers to accept deposits. Mike Cherry, the FSB\u2019s national chairman, said: \u201cThe warning from NatWest and RBS will be deeply concerning to small firms. FSB\u2019s latest research shows small business confidence is already at a four-year low. Firms are less optimistic, cutting headcount and curbing investment intentions. \u201cWhen the monetary policy committee meets next week to decide on interest rates, we would call on them to do everything possible to consider the implications of changing interest rates for smaller firms and the self-employed looking to maintain or grow their business.\u201d In his FT interview, Weale, who leaves the MPC after the August meeting, said monetary policy would not boost the economy immediately and may not prevent a recession. Wednesday sees the first estimate for second quarter UK GDP, with analysts expecting a growth to remain at 0.4%, the same as in the first three months of the year More signs of weakness in the economy came as mortgage approvals fell to 40,103 in June, down from 41,842 in May, according to the British Bankers Association. The BBA also reported that business lending fell by \u00a3526m in June, the first decline this year, indicating that businesses delayed big projects before June\u2019s Brexit vote.",

      "bodyText": "If you assumed SABMiller had already been consumed into Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s monopolistic megabrew mash-up, think again. It was only the cut-and-thrust of the bidding chapter that closed last November, when SAB\u2019s board capitulated and accepted a cash bid at \u00a344 a share, or \u00a371bn, from the Budweiser brigade. But regulators around the world still had to give a thumbs-up and the Chinese lot tends to dither. A big unrelated event has happened in the meantime. The UK has voted for Brexit and the pound has fallen 13% against the dollar. Sterling\u2019s plunge transforms the takeover arithmetic. The share prices of most big UK-listed companies that make large chunks of their earnings in dollars, as SABMiller does, have been boosted by the currency excitement. Diageo\u2019s shares are up 17.6% since June 23, for example. It is safe to assume an undisturbed SAB would have enjoyed a similar bounce. Note, too, that AB InBev\u2019s bid approach was timed opportunistically. The Brazilian business pounced when SAB\u2019s shares had fallen to \u00a330 amid worries about slower trading, especially in Africa. In the event, SAB has traded well. So maybe \u00a330 was the wrong benchmark to use to assess a takeover premium. Maybe \u00a333 would be closer to the mark. Add the post-Brexit currency whoosh and one might be seeing SAB\u2019s shares at \u00a338, or even close to \u00a340. Viewed that way, a bid of \u00a344 a share looks plain mean: the takeover top-up is miserable. Scenting rebellion in the ranks of SAB shareholders, AB InBev upped its offer to \u00a345 a share on Tuesday. But that barely moves the dial. Aberdeen Asset Management agrees and declared the new terms \u201cunacceptable\u201d. It also thinks the cash-and-shares alternative, designed to appeal to Altria and Bevco, who together own 40% of SAB, is unfair. That side-offer is worth \u00a351.14 to those willing to hold AB InBev shares for five years; most investors can\u2019t accept such lock-ups. This column argued last year that AB InBev would be getting SAB on the cheap, and that \u00a344 was \u00a32 short of being an honourable surrender by Jan du Plessis, SAB\u2019s chairman. That view has been reinforced by the unusual passage of events. Du Plessis now has a second chance to be a hero. AB InBev\u2019s revised terms give him and SAB\u2019s board the opportunity to withdraw their recommendation. They probably won\u2019t \u2013 but they definitely should. A bad deal last autumn looks even worse this summer. BT and Openreach\u2019s clunky legal separation Regulator Ofcom thinks BT should continue to own Openreach. That\u2019s easy to understand. But the network that controls most of the UK\u2019s broadband infrastructure should be \u201clegally separate\u201d. What does that even mean? According to Ofcom\u2019s eight-bar scale of degrees of separation, it is option 7. An independent Openreach board will be able to control spending but the budget will still be set by BT. Many of BT\u2019s rivals, such as Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk, wanted option 8 \u2013 a full breakup. BT, sensing discontent in Westminster, was prepared to offer a version of option 6 \u2013 a divisional board with independent members but still answerable to the parent. Ofcom, then, has landed in the middle. In one sense, that\u2019s sensible. It is surely correct that a full breakup of BT would be time-consuming and expensive. It is reasonable to try to grab some of the benefits of full separation, such as a bigger voice for customers, without the hassle of the full thing. Yet \u201clegal separation\u201d looks extremely awkward. Rivals suspect Ofcom is afraid to be bolder for fear of weakening the covenant on BT\u2019s huge pension fund. Why should the UK\u2019s digital future be dictated by the interests of BT pensioners? Fair point. Yet BT also has a reasonable grumble. Ownership looks a flimsy concept if the parent can\u2019t hire and fire the boss of Openreach at will. For practical purposes, BT should count its blessings and accept the new deal. It has avoided a breakup, which was the main argument. But legal separation remains to be proven. Ofcom pitches it as an opportunity for BT to make the structure work. Yes, but one suspects the regulator will also have to intervene regularly to oil a fundamentally clunky design.",

    "webTitle": "Executive pay: City report stops short of backing binding shareholder votes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A report by City grandees has set out a number of measures to help restore public confidence in executive pay, but stopped short of endorsing Theresa May\u2019s proposal for binding shareholder votes on senior management salaries. The report, which acknowledges executive pay is difficult to justify, did not set out how much directors should receive, either in absolute terms or compared with their wider workforce. It set out 10 recommendations, including the use of pay ratios, but refused to back the binding shareholder votes on executive pay suggested by the new prime minister. Drawn up by a committee that met under the auspices of the lobby group the Investment Association, the report also called for more flexibility in the way executive bonuses are structured away from the traditional long-term incentive plans (Ltips), which pay out over three or five years in shares. \u201cGrowing complexity has contributed to poor alignment between executives, shareholders and the company, sometimes leading to levels of remuneration which are difficult to justify,\u201d the report said. The chief executive of the insurer Legal &amp; General, Nigel Wilson, who chaired the committee behind the report, said: \u201cWe need to restore public confidence in executive pay.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have not commented specifically on the quantum of executive pay.\u201d Boardroom pay had trebled since 1998 during a period when the FTSE 100 had remained flat, said Wilson, and \u201cin the next 20 years we\u2019d like a much better outcome\u201d. The panel also included the chairman of Sainsbury\u2019s, David Tyler, and Edmund Truell, chairman of the strategic advisory board of Lancashire and London Pensions Partnership. Truell, when asked what \u201calignment\u201d between shareholders and executives meant, said: \u201cFor me this whole thing is about simplicity. I want my management teams to be incredibly wealthy because as a shareholder I\u2019ve made a lot of money.\u201d Complicated bonus schemes meant executives did not know how they were being paid and set up secret spreadsheets to work out what their bonuses could be, said Truell. He advocated the use of restricted shares, which pay out at a predetermined point in the future. Work on the report started last year and coincided with the appointment of May, who became prime minister in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union, and put the issue of executive pay back on the political agenda. During her leadership bid, she spoke of new votes for shareholders on executive pay and putting workers on boards. But the working group expressed caution about a binding vote on pay deals and suggested an \u201coption to inform the debate\u201d could be by having such a vote on companies that failed to receive 75% approval the previous year. An interim report in April \u2013 published just as the annual general meeting season was getting under way and as shareholders handed rebukes to boardrooms over pay at major companies such as BP \u2013 set out the views that more flexible pay deals were needed. Tyler, who said it would be difficult to set out three-year pay deals amid the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, said less use of Ltips would slow the drain of executive talent to private equity and family-run businesses. But, he said, it would not lead to higher pay but to lower average pay because executives did not know how to put a value on their complex long-term schemes. Tyler said firms were competing internationally for the best management and, at the same time, investors such as pension funds were the beneficiaries of good company performance. \u201cSometimes, if I may say, the media makes it out to be more simple than it really is,\u201d he said, claiming that a big pay packet is reported one year but a fall in pay the following year is ignored. At a launch event, the panel faced questions about whether more flexibility would lead to more fees for the pay consultants hired to design schemes, and how the foreign shareholders who held stakes in UK-listed companies would react to change. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, told the Guardian: \u201cIf they are going to be squeamish about [defining] quantum then the disconnect and screaming headlines will keep coming.\u201d A government spokesperson said the report would contribute to the debate. \u201cThe prime minister has said she wants to see stronger shareholder oversight of executive pay and greater transparency including better reporting of bonus targets and pay ratios. She has also called for a simplification of the way bonuses are paid so that incentives are better aligned with the long-term interests of the company and its shareholders,\u201d the spokesperson said.",

      "bodyText": "Ahead of some key central bank meetings this week, notably the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, investors managed to hold their nerve. So despite oil prices slipping back further, stock markets in Europe (mostly) ended in positive territory, lifted by positive news from the likes of BT and GKN. But banks remained in the doldrums ahead of Friday\u2019s European stress test results. Wall Street was marginally lower by the time Europe closed, as a spate of new data suggested a US rate rise could be on the cards again later in the year. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 added 13.90 points or 0.21% to 6724.03 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.49% to 10,247.76 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.15% at 4394.77 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.03% to 16,697.01 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.18% at 8560.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.22% to 566 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 32 points or 0.18%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In sum, the US data seems to point to a possible rate rise this year, which has not been lost on the stock market. Wall Street has now lost ground, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 80 points or 0.44%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: A batch of particularly strong US data points highlighted the frustrating position [Federal Reserve chair] Janet Yellen &amp; co find themselves in, where their domestic economy warrants another interest rate hike to normalise monetary policy. However, with global headwinds blowing more from the Atlantic and less from the Pacific, the Fed appears to have her hands tied for the time being. Despite markets largely disregarding the possibility of any actions from the Fed tomorrow, today\u2019s outperformance in data spanning manufacturing, consumer confidence and new home sales seemed to raise the likeliness of a 2016 hike, spurring weakness in US stocks. More on the rise in US new home sales. Reuters reports: New U.S. single-family home sales rose more than expected in June, reaching their highest level in nearly 8-1/2 years, the latest sign that the housing market was gathering momentum. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new home sales increased 3.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month, the highest level since February 2008. May\u2019s sales pace was revised up to 572,000 units from the previously reported 551,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.6 percent of the housing market, rising to a rate of 560,000 units last month. More US data, this time fairly reasonable, and giving the Federal Reserve something to think about. The July consumer confidence index came in at 97.3, better than the expected 95.9 and little changed from the revised 97.4 figure for June (down from an initial 98). And the Richmond Fed composite manufacturing index came in at +10 in July, compared to -10 in June. Back with the housing market, single family home sales rose 3.5% in June compared to no change in May. On the services data Markit said: July data suggested that growth in the U.S. service sector remained muted, with activity rising at the weakest pace in the current five-month sequence of expansion. A slower increase in new business was also recorded. On a more positive note, the rate of job creation picked up slightly and business sentiment improved markedly from June\u2019s record low. On the price front, slower increases were registered for both input costs and output prices during the month. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit said: The U.S. service sector remained stuck in a low gear at the start of the third quarter of 2016, with growth of activity remaining subdued amid a slower rise in new business. This is particularly disappointing given the decent numbers posted by the manufacturing sector last week. A bit more encouraging was the rebound in business confidence following June\u2019s survey low, suggesting that a return to stronger growth will be possible once the current soft patch comes to an end. Whether this will be before the presidential election or not remains to be seen, however. Growth in the US service sector is slowing, according to an initial estimate for July. Markit\u2019s services PMI index came in at 50.9, down from the 51.4 level seen in June and below forecasts of a figure of 52. But Markit\u2019s composite index - taking in both services and manufacturing - was up from 51.2 in June to 51.5, the highest since April. US markets are marginally higher in early trading as investors keep their powder dry ahead of a host of big name companies reporting later, including Apple and Twitter, as well as Wednesday\u2019s interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 11 points or 0.06%. Oil continues to come under pressure on persistent concerns about a supply glut at the same time as demand weakens along with the global economy. Brent crude is currently dow 0.36% at $44.56 a barrel, having earlier fallen as low as $44.14, a level not seen since the middle of May. Over to the US, and as the Federal Reserve meets to decide its latest move on interest rates, there is a spate of economic data coming out for them to consider. Markets are not expecting the US central bank to change rates, although there is a growing school of thought that it may raise borrowing costs before the end of the year if the economic picture seems to be heading in the right direction. Larry Hatheway, chief economist at asset management firm GAM, said: The Federal Reserve is unlikely to announce a change in its target Fed Funds rate at the conclusion of this week\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. A hallmark of the Yellen Fed, and its predecessors, is clear communication regarding policy decisions, avoiding surprises. Given the uncertainties the Fed had cited around \u2018Brexit\u2019 as well as the weakness of the May employment report, the Fed is widely believed to be \u2018on hold\u2019, a view it will almost certainly confirm this week. That said, the FOMC statement is also likely to recognise that the much discussed concerns for capital markets, the world economy and \u2013 by extension \u2013 the US economy stemming from the UK \u2018Leave\u2019 result have not, for the most part, manifested themselves. Without saying so directly, the Fed is likely to conclude that the primary economic consequences of \u2018Brexit\u2019 will be felt in the UK, with little impact on US economic conditions. So the latest data is likely to be scoured for signs of how the US economy is performing. First off the block is some housing data, which shows prices rising less than expected but still indicating a fairly strong marke.t The S&amp;P Case-Schiller index rose 5.2% in May year on year, below the 5.4% figure in the previous month and the 5.5% forecast by economists polled by Reuters. David M. Blitzer of the S&amp;P index committee said: Overall, housing is doing quite well...In addition to strong prices, sales of existing homes reached the highest monthly level since 2007 as construction of new homes showed continuing gains. Assuming Martin Weale is a bellwether, what might the Bank of England do next week to stimulate the economy? Jeremy Cook of World First predicts an interest rate cut, a new bout of quantitative easing (QE; buying bonds with new money), and new measures to encourage banks to lend. He says: We are maintaining our call for a Bank of England interest rate cut by 25bps and an increase in QE by somewhere between \u00a350bn and \u00a375bn. Within the announcement we are also looking for something similar to the ECB\u2019s TLTRO \u2013 Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operation \u2013 that allows banks to borrow at negative rates i.e. get paid for borrowing. This would be a subsidy to British banks that should insulate the financial system from the unwanted effects of negative deposit rates should the Bank see the need. This is the kind of financial policy engineering that may allow for a near term pick-up in inflation expectations and, maybe more importantly, a calming of fears around financial stability. But other economists are split over the chances of more quantitative easing, on top of the \u00a3375bn of bonds already held by the BoE. Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that the Bank doesn\u2019t have many conventional tools left.... We should have worn special hats today, as apparently it\u2019s Mario Draghi Day. No, the European Central Bank president hasn\u2019t been honoured with his own holiday (yet). Instead, it\u2019s the fourth anniversary of his pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. That surprise promise, made in London in 2012, paved the way towards various initiatives to fight the eurozone\u2019s slide into deflation. Draghi\u2019s pledge to buy unlimited quantities of bonds from struggling nations helped to drive down eurozone bond yields. And thanks to the splurge of quantitative easing, the ECB\u2019s balance sheet has swollen dramatically. However, but inflation remains worryingly low, growth is still quite weak and inflation too high. Maybe we\u2019ll have more to celebrate next year. In the meantime, check out the FT\u2019s collection of graphs to show how the last four years have developed. After a quiet morning in the City, BT is still the best-performing stock on the FTSE 100. Its shares have now jumped by almost 5%, showing investors\u2019 verdict on Ofcom\u2019s decision not to split the company. This table shows how significant Openreach is to BT\u2019s financial performance: Britain\u2019s banks have turned up their noses at the latest offer of cheap cash from the Bank of England. The BoE has allocated just \u00a375m of liquidity in its latest weekly auction since the Brexit vote. This gives banks a chance to swap assets for ready cash, in case they are facing a funding squeeze. Clearly they are not - \u00a375m is the lowest take-up since the EU crisis began, down from \u00a3250m last week. The Federation of Small Businesses is deeply alarmed about the prospect that firms could be charged negative interest rates by their banks. Mike Cherry, the FSB\u2019s national chairman, has urged the Bank of England to fully consider the consequences of cutting rates to fresh record low: Today\u2019s warning from Natwest and RBS will be deeply concerning to small firms. FSB\u2019s latest research shows small business confidence is already at a four year low. Firms are less optimistic, cutting headcount and curbing investment intentions. \u201cWhen the Monetary Policy Committee meets next week to decide on interest rates, we would call on them to do everything possible to consider the implications of changing interest rates for smaller firms and the self-employed looking to maintain or grow their business. \u201cIt is now vital that all finance providers holding deposits from small businesses do everything they can to update customers concerned about any changes to their Business Current Account (BCA) during this uncertain economic period. Martin Weale\u2019s new enthusiasm for a fresh stimulus package raises the prospect that UK interest rates are slashed to almost zero next week. A interest rate cut would present challenges for the banking sector, as rates are already just 0.5%. The Guardian revealed last night that NatWest is already warning business customers that it could impose negative interest rates \u2013 meaning they would be charged to leave money at the bank. Clive Lewis, head of enterprise at the ICAEW, says businesses need to prepare for negative interest rates. He fears that it could encourage firms to take money out of the bank, raising the risk of theft. Lewis says: \u201cIt is vital that all customers, but especially small business customers, check all communications from their bank and monitor their accounts. Banks are well within their rights to do this, but for small businesses where cash flow is tight, this could cause significant problems if they are not prepared. \u201cThe danger is that this could have a distorting effect by incentivising customers not to keep their money in the bank \u2013 either prompting unwarranted spending or causing them to store money in ways that are less safe\u201d Lending to UK business and housebuyers has fallen, highlighting nervousness created by the EU referendum. Mortgage approvals fell to 40,103 in June, down from 41,842 [corrected] in May, according to the British Bankers Association. That\u2019s the fewest mortgage approvals since March 2015, although more money was loaned than a year ago. The BBA also reports that business lending fell in June for the first time this year, indicating that businesses delayed big projects before June\u2019s Brexit vote. BBA chief economist Rebecca Harding says we can\u2019t read too much into this, though: \u201cOverall, business confidence was clearly fragile in anticipation of the outcome of the vote, but these results are not a verdict on the health of the economy post-Brexit,\u201d The pound has weakened against all other major currencies this morning, after Martin Weale threw his weight behind a new stimulus package for the UK economy. Sterling is still down half a cent against the US dollar at $1.309. It\u2019s down a similar amount against the euro too, at \u20ac1.192. Traders are calculating that Weale\u2019s change of heart is significant, as other policymakers may also be spurred into action by the latest economic data. UK hedge fund manager Man Group has warned that the EU referendum is casting a shadow over the City. Man posted a 3% drop in funds under management today. CEO Manny Roman says customers could be spooked by the Brexit vote: The outlook, particularly cross border post Brexit, remains uncertain and accordingly the risk appetite of our clients has the potential to impact flows. Oil giant BP has warned that economic conditions are tough, after missing City forecasts in the last quarter. BP made an underlying replacement cost profit of $720m in the second quarter of 2016, down from $1.3bn last year, as the low oil price continued to hit revenues. BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley sounded cautious, telling shareholders that: \u201cAs we look forward we expect the external environment to remain challenging,\u201d BP shares are down 1.7% this morning. Next week\u2019s Bank of England monetary policy committee meeting is Martin Weale\u2019s last chance to influence monetary policy, as he steps down later in August. He has a somewhat spotty record too \u2013 having voted to raise borrowing costs several times since the financial crisis due to (unwarranted?) worries over inflation. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale comments: He has attended 71 MPC meetings so far (if my maths is right) and has voted to leave rates unchanged 59 times and to hike 12 times. The MPC has never moved rates over that period but perhaps this time, he\u2019ll be a bellwether. Martin Weale\u2019s warning about the weakening UK economy shows that the Bank of England is close to launching a stimulus package, say analysts. Here\u2019s Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct: Although the Bank of England meet again to discuss rates next week, it had initially been thought that meaningful action would have to wait until we had a full quarter\u2019s worth of post-Brexit data on the table, but opinions here may now be shifting. Jeremy Cook of World First agrees: With Weale now expected to vote for a policy cut in what will be his last meeting as a member of the Monetary Policy Committee it is now almost a guarantee that the majority will plump for a stimulatory increase in monetary accommodation. The exact make-up of that policy still remains in doubt. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever is struck by Weale\u2019s sudden change of view: Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has also blasted Ofcom for not splitting BT up, given the steady criticism over the telco\u2019s broadband service. He argues that the regulator has proved to be toothless, even though today\u2019s ruling forces Openreach to work more closely with other service providers: \u201cIt provides a poor service to customers and has been starved of investment. Giving more powers and investment to Openreach is better than nothing but the crucial thing is it will leave millions of customers with poor quality broadband. That is unacceptable in the modern age when the government claims to be creating a digital economy. \u201cIf a watchdog yet again fails to bark, perhaps it is time to put it down.\u201d John Fingleton, the former head of Britain\u2019s Office for Fair Trading, reckons Ofcom have blundered by not completing separating BT\u2019s network arm from the retail side of the company. BT\u2019s bosses may be breathing a sigh of relief this morning after regulator Ofcom resisted pressure to formally split the company. Shares in BT have jumped by 3% after Ofcom recommended that Openreach, its broadband network provider, should become a legally separate company. Some BT critics had argued that Openreach should be completely split off, to prevent the company from failing to invest enough in the country\u2019s telecoms infrastructure. Those calls have not been heeded by the regulator, though, as my colleague Angela Monaghan explains: BT will not have to sell off its Openreach broadband division despite concerns that it has been starved of investment and provides a poor quality of service. The media regulator, Ofcom, has instead ordered BT to give more independence and investment powers to Openreach. Ofcom said Openreach should be run as a legally separate company within BT Group, with its own board and its own brand. \u201cThis model would provide Openreach with the greatest degree of independence from BT Group that is possible without incurring the costs and disruption \u2013 to industry and consumers \u2013 associated with separating the companies entirely,\u201d Ofcom said, announcing the decision. Shares in London are rising in early trading, partly thanks to the weakening pound: Martin Weale\u2019s decision to back fresh stimulus measures next week has caused a stir in the City. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada reckon that there\u2019s only one \u2018hawk\u2019 left on the committee: The Financial Times carries an interview with BoE MPC member Martin Weale that indicates he will now vote in favour of an immediate stimulus package at the August meeting. In a speech last week said he wanted to \u201cwait for firmer evidence before making any policy change\u201d but following the sharp fall in the recent \u2018flash\u2019 PMI surveys he now thinks that news will be very material for next week\u2019s decision. The business survey evidence has been a lot worse than he was expecting. Of the MPC members to have spoken on the record since the referendum, that now leaves just Kristin Forbes as a hawkish outlier. However, Weale is also getting some stick for this u-turn, given he was arguing against immediate stimulus measures last week. City traders are selling the pound with gusto, following Martin Weale\u2019s hint that he\u2019ll vote for a Bank of England stimulus programme next week. Sterling has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3092, which isn\u2019t great news for anyone heading to America on their holidays. That adds to Friday\u2019s selloff, when the pound dropped by 1.5 cents after Markit\u2019s PMI survey showed the economy shrinking at its fastest rate since 2009. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news this morning is that one of the Bank of England\u2019s most hawkish members has warned that the economy is worse than he expected. Martin Weale has been shaken into action by last week\u2019s grim purchasing managing index (PMI), which showed that manufacturing firms and service companies had suffered falling orders and demand in July. That report implies that the UK economy is probably shrinking this month. And it means Weale is likely to vote for a new stimulus package, which may include an interest rate cut, at next week\u2019s meeting. Weale told the FT that last Friday\u2019s PMIs were \u201ca lot worse than I had thought\u201d and showed \u201cexpectations have worsened sharply\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are the best short-term indicator we have at the moment. I certainly feel they are very material for the decision we\u2019ll be taking next week.\u201d Here\u2019s a reminder of just how sharply the PMI slumped into contraction territory: It\u2019s quite a change of stance from Weale- -- back on 18 July, he argued that we didn\u2019t have enough evidence that the economy was suffering from June\u2019s Brexit vote. Clearly a week is a long time in monetary policy.... Only one member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, Gertjan Vlieghe voted to cut interest rates at this month\u2019s meeting. But Weale won\u2019t be the only policymaker to have clocked the importance of the PMIs, so the next meeting on August 4 could be rather lively... Here\u2019s the FT\u2019s story: Also coming up today.... Telecoms regulator Ofcom is announcing plans to restructure BT Openreach, the telco\u2019s network arm. It will be split off into a \u2018distinct company\u2019, separate from the rest of the operation. But will it be enough to allay concerns over service levels and broadband speed? We\u2019ll be watching the BHS scandal again today too, after MPs yesterday released a damning report into the collapse of the retailer. Sir Philip Green, who came into particular criticism, is now threatening to sue MP Frank Field over comparison to Robert Maxwell. There\u2019s a flurry of company news this morning, with oil giant BP and fund manager Man Group reporting to the City: But the major corporate news won\u2019t come until late tonight, when Apple and Twitter reveal how well they performed in the last quarter. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main news through the day....",

So despite oil prices slipping back further, stock markets in Europe (mostly) ended in positive territory, lifted by positive news from the likes of BT and GKN. But banks remained in the doldrums ahead of Friday\u2019s European stress test results. Wall Street was marginally lower by the time Europe closed, as a spate of new data suggested a US rate rise could be on the cards again later in the year. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 added 13.90 points or 0.21% to 6724.03</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.49% to 10,247.76</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.15% at 4394.77</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.03% to 16,697.01</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.18% at 8560.2</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market added 0.22% to 566</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 32 points or 0.18%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

      "bodyText": "Profits at BP plunged 44% to $720m (\u00a3550m) in the second quarter of 2016, as the collapse of crude prices continues to affect the energy sector. Oil companies have rushed to cut costs and curtail investment after oil prices fell to a 12-year low in January, resulting in tens of thousands of job losses in the UK alone. BP boss Bob Dudley said: \u201cCompared with a year earlier, the underlying second-quarter result was impacted by lower oil and gas prices.\u201d Dudley said concern about over supply because of the rising number of rigs being drilled in the US was \u201coverdone\u201d. BP is working on the assumption that oil prices will be in the range of $50-$55 a barrel next year. Oil prices fell to a three-month low on Monday amid concerns of a global oversupply of crude and natural gas. On Tuesday Brent crude was trading at just above $44 \u2013 about 60% lower than two years ago. Dudley said it was \u201ca huge relief\u201d that the group was finally able to draw a line under the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. BP took a $5.2bn charge related to Deepwater in the second quarter, with the disaster costing the group a total of $61.6bn. The group has been slashing costs and axing thousands of jobs, cutting around 10% of its workforce to offset tough trading. BP is planning to invest about $17bn this year, compared with $27bn 2013. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, we\u2019re much more efficient,\u201d Dudley said, adding that the industry had overspent in the past. He said that much of the company\u2019s restructuring was complete. \u201c[The outlook for the business] feels more certain today than it has in the last six years. \u201cWe are delivering significant improvements to the business that will stick at any oil price. We are now well down the path of transforming our business to compete, whatever the future holds. We now see a much stronger outlook for BP and are focused on growth, both for this decade and beyond.\u201d Despite the chief executive\u2019s upbeat comments, BP was among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 in early trading on Tuesday, with shares down 2.4% as second-quarter profits were lower than analysts expected. Dudley said the North Sea was a \u201cparticularly challenging part of the industry, high cost and late life.\u201d BP has two major projects in the pipeline west of Shetland, which is expected to extend the company\u2019s commitment to the area to about 2050. \u201cThe sigh of relief emanating from BP HQ is almost palpable as the Gulf of Mexico spill is finally consigned to the history books,\u201d said Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management in London. \u201cThis is not to say that the challenges are over, not least of which is an underlying oil price still markedly short of the level which would provide comfort for the company.\u201d Bernard Looney, BP\u2019s new chief of exploration and production, told investors recently that the company planned to deliver new production of 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2020, which includes 500,000 barrels by the end of 2017. \u201cAs we look forward we expect the external environment to remain challenging, but we have a strong pipeline of new projects,\u201d said Dudley. In terms of production, gas now accounts for just over half of BP\u2019s business at 52%, and is expected to rise to about 60% by the end of the decade.",

      "bodyText": "Supermarkets endured their worst sales performance in at least two years in the month following the Brexit vote but analysts are blaming poor weather rather than fears about life outside the EU. Analysts at Kantar Worldpanel said the grocery market had declined by 1.1% in the four weeks to 17 July, which City analysts said was the worst month of trading for at least four years if periods affected by the timing of Easter were excluded. \u201cThe weather is having a big impact on the industry at the moment, adding further pressure on sales from deflation and responding to the growth of discounters,\u201d said Mike Watkins, UK head of retailer and business insight at analyst Nielsen. Nielsen\u2019s latest data \u2013 which is based on a slightly different methodology to Kantar \u2013 indicated the value of sales fell 2.4% in the four weeks to 16 July compared with the same period a year earlier. That represents the worst figure since the July 2014, if periods affected by the timing of Easter are excluded. But Richard Clarke, a retail analyst at City broker Bernstein, cautioned: \u201cDon\u2019t pin this all on Brexit. July 2015 saw 35-degree temperatures, whereas this year brought rain and wind with the good weather only coming more recently.\u201d Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said there had been no immediate impact from Brexit on the prices retailers were charging or the volume of goods people were buying. \u201cThe nation\u2019s average shopping basket is 1.4% cheaper than a year ago, exactly the same level of deflation as reported last month, and it remains to be seen if the Brexit vote will bring about any price rises this year,\u201d McKevitt said. Analysts expect the price of food and drink to rise in the autumn when UK harvests drop off and more goods have to be imported from abroad. The falling value of the pound, making food imports more expensive, will put pressure on retailers to increase prices despite heavy competition. McKevitt said that over the three months to 17 July, beer sales had been lifted during the early days of the Euro 2016 football tournament but then gone into rapid reversal after England\u2019s early exit. Beer and lager were also hindered by poor early summer weather, as were barbecue favourites such as sausages, which fell by 6.3%. The UK\u2019s four largest supermarket chains \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 continued to see sales fall and market share decline. Asda was the worst-performing chain with sales down 5.6%, taking its market share to 15.5%. Tesco put on the best performance of the majors with sales down 0.7% \u2013 its best performance since March last year \u2013 taking its share to 28.3%. The big four are suffering from increased competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as growth at upmarket chain Waitrose and the Co-op\u2019s small local stores. Lidl was the fastest-growing chain in the UK with sales up 12.5% in the three months to 17 July taking its market share to 4.5%, while Aldi\u2019s sales rose 11% taking its share to 6.2%. The mid-July heatwave is likely to have helped kickstart sales in recent weeks as families sparked up barbecues and enjoyed picnics in the sunshine. On Tuesday, Waitrose said it had seen a 7.2% rise in sales in the week to 23 July; its customers bought 74% more ice cream and 166% more children\u2019s lollies. Sales of Pimm\u2019s grew by 63% and sparkling wine by 93%. But sister chain John Lewis said sales fell by 4.3% in the week as Brits chose to make the most of the summer weather rather than shop for clothes and homewares.",

      "bodyText": "Even an all-day breakfast can\u2019t fix everything. McDonald\u2019s announced its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, reporting that its revenue dropped by 4% to $6.26bn as the burger giant\u2019s turnaround efforts stumbled both at home and abroad in the face of growing uncertainty among consumers. McDonald\u2019s announced the fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales across all of McDonald\u2019s business segments but investors were disappointed that growth appeared to be slowing. British-born chief executive Steve Easterbrook said global uncertainty had dampened consumers\u2019 appetites. The latest quarter included the run up to the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit, and an increasingly hostile election campaign in the US. \u201cThere is a broader level of uncertainty in consumer\u2019s minds at the moment both trying to gauge their financial security going forward whether through elections or through global events people are certainly mindful of an unsettled world,\u201d said Easterbrook. Uncertainly causes people to hold back on spending, he added. For the quarter ending on 30 June, same-store sales for US stores opened for at least 13 months were up by just 1.8%. Analysts expected growth of 3.4%. Global sales rose by 3.1%, below the 3.6% expected by the analysts. \u201cOur second-quarter performance, which marks our fourth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales across all business segments, provides a clear indication that customers are responding to the steps we\u2019re taking to deliver the menu and value options they want at the convenience of McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Easterbrook said on Tuesday. Easterbrook noted that the company was making \u201csteady progress\u201d in its transformation as it entered the 15th month of its turnaround plan, which was unveiled in May of last year. Parts of that plan, the All Day Breakfast and McPick 2, which allows customers to select two items from its McPick menu for $5, continued to contribute to sales growth, the company said. McDonald\u2019s has doubled down on its All Day Breakfast strategy. Come autumn, its All Day Breakfast menu will include three new breakfast items: biscuits, McMuffins and McGriddles. McDonald\u2019s is also refreshing its partnerships and promotions offers to engage customer, said Easterbrook. A good example of that, he said, is the company\u2019s partnership with mobile game phenomena Pok\u00e9mon Go in Japan. As part of the promotion, McDonald\u2019s 3,000 restaurants in Japan will be turned into Pok\u00e9mon gyms - where players can train their virtual pets. The fastfood company was the first corporate partner to sign up with Pok\u00e9mon Go. \u201cClearly, we are a preferred partner,\u201d said Easterbrook. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fun program, it\u2019s been great for the business.\u201d As part of its turnaround plan, McDonald\u2019s is also planning to relocate its global headquarters from suburban Chicago to the city\u2019s downtown area. The move was announced last month and is expected to be completed by spring 2018. McDonald\u2019s is also in the process of selling about 3,500 of its 36,000 restaurants. By 2018, about 90% of McDonald\u2019s restaurants should be franchised, Easterbrook announced last year. \u201cI will not shy away from the urgent need to reset this business,\u201d he said when he took over in January 2015. These efforts to restructure McDonald\u2019s do not come without costs. The second quarter\u2019s operating income included about $230m in charges related to company\u2019s relocation and refranchising plans. Some have raised concerns that in its effort to become a leaner and more profitable company, McDonald\u2019s might seek to eliminate some jobs and replace its workers with machines. The debate about whether robots could replace fast-food workers has become even more heated amid a years-long push by workers to increase the US minimum wage to $15 an hour. Speaking at this year\u2019s shareholder meeting in May, Easterbrook said that McDonald\u2019s \u201cwill always have an important human element\u201d and that any automation would just be another way for the company to focus on its customer service and \u201cbetter dining area experience. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as being a risk to job elimination,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt might change the nature of the jobs in our restaurants.\u201d On Tuesday, Easterbrook noted that the company continues to look to technology to make visiting McDonald\u2019s a \u201csmoother, more enjoyable and easier experience\u201d. Technology has been especially helpful in streamlining McDonald\u2019s drive-through operations, he said. \u201cOnce you get your accuracy right, then the whole drive through lane just operates far smoother,\u201d Easterbrook explained. To improve its drive-through operations, McDonald\u2019s has simplified its menu boards and even changed font size on the order receipts. The company will continue to let technology \u201cdo some of the heavy lifting\u201d in improving of its processes \u201cwhether it\u2019s voice recognition in the drive through speakers all the way to ordering ahead via the internet or the app\u201d. McDonald\u2019s shares were down 5% after the announcement.",

      "bodyText": "Parliament\u2019s damning report on \u201cKing\u201d Phil Greed\u2019s role in the BHS scandal has slipped too quickly back on to next day\u2019s inside pages, a controversy clearly too close for comfort for some media tycoons. King Phil himself has created a diversion by threatening to sue the Labour MP Frank Field for saying he has behaved \u201cworse than Robert Maxwell\u201d. Field doesn\u2019t seem too bothered. Clever Frank. But surely more attention needs to be paid to the role of Lord Grabiner QC, the non-executive chairman of Greed\u2019s Arcadia group from 2002 until last year\u2019s final meltdown, and a very grand legal grandee. As the joint select committee of MPs, doing an excellent job on this occasion, suggests, Lord Grabafee \u2013 Private Eye\u2019s respectful nickname \u2013 was paid \u00a3125,000 a year (only half what Boris Johnson called \u201cchicken feed\u201d for his weekly Telegraph jottings) to provide \u201ca veneer of establishment credibility\u201d to Arcadia while King Phil got on with the serious business of enriching himself from BHS. Like many such appointees \u2013 at Cadbury\u2019s, Northern Rock and RBS \u2013 Grabiner failed abysmally to protect either the firm, its staff and pensioners or its loyal customers, from circling predators. He was forced to admit that he only learned from the press that King Phil\u2019s \u00a31 choice of buyer for BHS, Dominic Chappell, was a very dodgy, inexperienced ex-bankrupt. His approval was an \u201cafter event ratification\u201d, which sounds a bit like a morning after pill. Awful stuff and, as we have to point out these days, all our own fault, not that of those interfering busybodies in Brussels. But my interest here is in that supposed \u201cveneer of establishment credibility\u201d. Like \u201celite\u201d it is a familiar clich\u00e9 in political discourse, but does establishment have any meaning in contemporary Britain in ways it still did on its last gasp 50 years ago? Even to ask the question is enough to provoke howls of outrage from Corbynites and Faragistes who, though quite well placed themselves, tell their supporters they must take back control from hidden forces of the establishment. The word was popularised in the 1950s by Henry Fairlie, a brilliant, rather louche columnist. Anthony Sampson, who had much more stamina, put it firmly between hard covers in his Anatomy of Britain series on the structures of power. In a gesture to more democratic and demotic times, Sampson called his last version Who Runs This Place? (2004) and concluded that nobody much did any more. The old interlocking circles of power, politics, the judiciary, the City, business, universities, even the TUC and the Church of England, where a lot of people from upper middle class backgrounds all knew each other, were much diminished in both cohesion and power. Globalisation, in both an economic and politico-military sense, had made Britain more of a team player, thanks to Nato, the UN, the G7 and G20, the IMF and World Bank, and, of course, the EU. Successive prime ministers had centralised power within the state \u2013 often because institutions were failing \u2013 but had also given lots of power away: to quangos, to the devolved parliaments, northern powerhouses and (of course again) to market forces. I think that\u2019s about right. Modern power in Britain is deployed in a chaotic rather than schematic way, often in response to public or media pressure, short term in design and impact, while major decisions \u2013 a new runway for the south-east or reform of the tax system \u2013 are shelved as too difficult. There isn\u2019t the will or cohesion, there aren\u2019t an agreed set of rules by which respectable and responsible people are supposed to behave, or at least to pretend to behave when in public. Where does Lord Grabafee fit into all this? I don\u2019t know him, he\u2019s reputably the second highest paid lawyer in Britain and a highly successful commercial lawyer. But he\u2019s certainly not establishment in the old sense. For one thing he\u2019s Jewish, a bit of a black mark to ancient regime types, and a London grammar school boy who went to the London School of Economics, not Oxbridge, to read law. Obviously very clever, he rose through the system as a government barrister (trade-related matters) and later a part-time judge. He must have caught Tony Blair\u2019s eye because he was made a Labour peer in 1999, though he resigned the peers\u2019 whip \u2013 not from the party \u2013 after deciding Jeremy Corbyn (\u201cI have nothing in common whatever with Mr Corbyn\u201d) was a no-hoper. No great loss, I hear Corbynites cry, though the two men\u2019s social backgrounds are probably quite similar. Grabiner has supported many good causes and is currently president of the University of Law, as well as the master of Clare College in Cambridge. He even briefly became a hero to Liverpool FC fans. It all sounds very establishment. But wait. Grabiner is also the lawyer who acted as the chairman of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s management and standards committee set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal in 2011, to protect the Australian/American tycoon\u2019s US interests from risk of potentially fatal, criminal prosecution there. It did so by handing over evidence of misconduct by its Sun and News of the World staff to the cops. Most reporters thus thrown to the wolves by their bosses got acquitted on public interest defence grounds, though some of their paid contacts and sources were jailed. It was not Fleet Street\u2019s finest hour, but it worked for Murdoch and \u2013 at a reported \u00a33,000 an hour \u2013 presumably for Grabiner, who popped up controversially again this summer in private equity chancer Guy Hands\u2019s doomed bid to sue Citigroup. Grabiner was not in court to see his client withdraw claims of fraud against the bank. Is this establishment conduct? Was it so when he advised Reignwood, the new Chinese owners of the elite Wentworth golf club in Surrey (for a fee) that they were legally entitled to cull the membership from 4,000 to 800 super-rich and ramp up members\u2019 fees? Grabiner had been a non-exec director under the previous owner and, when accused of betrayal, said his advice was purely professional. I\u2019m not sure if work like this is just fine or a bit shabby? We shouldn\u2019t be sentimental about the ancient regime. Read Trollope\u2019s novel The Way We Live Now to see what financial scandals those upright Victorians endured. But disgrace was disgrace in those days, guilt and shame were more severely and lastingly imposed - sometimes unfairly \u2013 and, I suspect, more keenly felt. Nowadays, when accountability and transparency are fairer and less class-biased than they were then, public figures and (dreadful word) celebrities can be caught doing awful things \u2013 jailed even \u2013 but soon bounce back on TV and in print. Close \u201cfriends\u201d of David Cameron, like Michael Gove or bicycling guru Steve Hilton, can divulge his private conversations for political advantage in the Brexit campaign. Nick Clegg\u2019s wife, Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez, who seems to have quite a high opinion of herself, can publish a book of coalition recipes and be snooty about Sam Cam\u2019s weakness for Hellman\u2019s mayo over homemade. David Laws\u2019s high-minded memoirs peddle gossip on everyone. And so it goes on. Margaret Thatcher can give a knighthood to Jimmy Savile against the advice of her cabinet secretary, and Tony Blair, keen to promote entrepreneurs instead of stuffy old boys, does the same for BHS\u2019s Phil Greed. Cameron later asks Greed to weed out public sector waste (ho ho). If this is an establishment at work, it isn\u2019t working very well. As the Chilcot report exposed among buck-passing officialdom, there is a shortage of coherence, cohesion, even of honour. So will Grabiner be sleeping well after this week\u2019s assault? My hunch is he\u2019ll be just fine, and that the most indignity he will suffer are quiet words of sympathy about those beastly MPs. King Phil may cough up for his pensioners (if he still has enough money) and even keep his soiled knighthood. But a \u201cveneer of establishment credibility\u201d ain\u2019t what it used to be.",

      "bodyText": "NatWest this week shocked the banking industry by changing the terms and conditions on its business accounts to pave the way to charge customers for holding their deposits, although it insists it has no immediate plans to do so. In an upside-down world where interest rates turn negative and you could end up paying a bank to lend them your money, what are the alternatives? 1. Under the mattress If you know for certain your bank is going to give you back less than you put into an account, then why leave it there? Why not stash it under the mattress? True, your \u00a31,000 will still be worth \u00a31,000 after a year. Unfortunately it\u2019s what lots of Greeks did when their financial system verged on total collapse. One couple in their 80s took \u20ac80,000 (\u00a366,000) out of the bank, stuck it under the mattress \u2013 and had it nicked within days. If you hold cash in your house, most insurance policies will pay you back just \u00a3500 if you suffer a fire or burglary. If you must hide it in the house, don\u2019t use the mattress. The internet is full of \u201c15 Secret Hiding Places That Will Fool Even the Smartest Burglar\u201d listicles; our favourite is a realistic-looking iceberg lettuce that doubles up as a lockable safe you keep in the back of your fridge. 2. In property It\u2019s almost every Brit\u2019s favourite investment. Trouble is, \u00a31,000 won\u2019t get you far. The typical deposit an investor now has to put down for a buy-to-let property is around \u00a355,000. What\u2019s more, stamp duty is higher on buy-to-lets, and from next April anyone with a BTL mortgage faces a raft of tax increases. If you have just \u00a31,000, the boring but sensible option in a world of zero interest rates is to use the money to pay down your mortgage. 3. Peer-to peer lending This is where you use the internet to link up with people who need to borrow, cutting out the banks and earning yourself a higher rate of interest. More than 150,000 people now have peer-to-peer accounts in the UK \u2013 the big players are Zopa, Ratesetter and Funding Circle \u2013 with around \u00a36bn lent out. Currently, rates on offer are between 3% and 7%, although these will fall if Bank of England base rate drops to zero or below. But in finance you don\u2019t get this sort of return without lots of risk; China, Sweden and the US have already seen peer-to-peer companies collapse, and in the UK if anything goes wrong you\u2019re in the cold. There is no safety net if the company goes bust, so you could lose every penny. 4. Gold After the Brexit vote, the price of gold rocketed, with bullion dealers reporting record demand from nervous investors seeking a safe haven. An ounce of gold jumped by $61 as the result emerged, hitting $1,324. The Royal Mint lets you buy gold in units of \u00a320 upwards, and will store it for you, too. Or buy an exchange-traded fund, which tracks the price of physical gold, at a charge of 0.4% a year. But in truth, gold has been a lousy long-term investment. Loads of small investors rushed in during the global financial crash, pushing the price up to $1,837 an ounce in 2011, so are now sitting on losses of around 25%. 5. Shares and funds Dividends from some of Britain\u2019s biggest companies currently look very attractive compared to the prospect of zero interest rates on savings accounts. Take Legal &amp; General, the insurer which has been around since 1836. Buy its shares today and, so long as the company maintains its dividend, the income from the shares will be worth 6.7% on your money. L&amp;G recently reported its profits, and is confident it will maintain its policy of increasing dividends every year. Some analysts rate it a \u201cscreaming buy\u201d. Alternatively, buy an equity income fund. These pool the shares of the big dividend-paying companies, and typically achieve a payout of around 3.5% to 4% a year. Minimum investments are usually \u00a3500 to \u00a31,000. Of course, the risks are high; BP used to be the biggest dividend payer in Britain until the Deepwater Horizon disaster wiped out much of its profits, while the big banks were the steady-eddies of every equity income fund. Yet for the last seven years RBS has not paid a penny in dividends, and there are few signs of that returning, especially when the bank may not be paying depositors a penny in interest. 6. Renewable energy and community finance schemes Sounds nice and green but too woolly and not likely to make much of a profit? Not at all \u2013 many renewable energy schemes are products designed by financiers to give steady long-term returns that, with a good wind, can give you 6% a year. Try platforms such as Abundance and Ethex to find schemes, with all the usual warnings that these are relatively high-risk. 7. Classic cars, wine, stamps, antiques and other collectables If you believe the hype, these have been sensational places to put your money. Your \u00a31,000 would stretch to a just one-third of a single bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1982 vintage. If you had bought it in 2000 and sold it in 2010 you would have made a profit of 1,137%, largely as the new filthy rich of China became obsessed with it. But since the credit crunch, wine has fallen out of favour; buyers who snapped up 2010 Lafite Rothschilds have lost around half of their money since then. Classic cars have had a better run, although since 2015 even the price of Ferraris has stalled. Better to buy an Austin Allegro; 642,340 were built from 1973 to 1982, but fewer than 300 are left on Britain\u2019s roads and can be picked up for around the \u00a31,000 mark.",

      "bodyText": "BT will not have to sell off its Openreach broadband division despite concerns that it has been starved of investment and provides a poor quality of service to millions of homes. The telecoms regulator, Ofcom, has instead ordered BT to give more independence and investment powers to Openreach, which owns the fibre and copper wires that run from the local telephone exchange to homes and businesses. Ofcom said Openreach should be run as a legally separate company within BT Group, with its own board, an independent chairman and its own brand. The regulator\u2019s chief executive, Sharon White, said the alternative choice of forcing BT to sell the division \u2013 as demanded by its rivals \u2013 would take too long. \u201cThis is a practical plan that can be implemented within months, unlike a sell-off of Openreach, which would take years,\u201d White said, pointing to issues such as land contracts and pensions. \u201cThis model should deliver \u2026 without years and years of legal wrangling. This is a structural change in incentives.\u201d She said the UK was lagging far behind other countries, with only 2% of the country receiving ultrafast broadband delivered via fibre-optic lines, similar to Germany. Korea, Spain, Lithuania and Portugal are at around 60%, and Japan at 70%. Steve Unger, Ofcom\u2019s director of strategy, said a full-blown separation would trigger \u201cvery significant costs\u201d related to BT\u2019s \u00a37bn pension deficit pension, to make arrangements for employees within Openreach. White added that making Openreach a legally separate company within BT would require it to act in the best interests of all broadband customers in the UK and not just BT customers. \u201cOpenreach has not done a good enough job on customer service.\u201d BT\u2019s rivals \u2013 Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk \u2013 argue that the company has dragged its heels on opening its network to their engineers, which stymies their ability to offer homes superfast broadband access. White said this would no longer be the case. \u201cThis could bring about significant change. It will mean you have faster, more reliable broadband. It will mean engineers turning up on time and getting the job done first time. And crucially for the UK it will mean more investment in fast fibre to the doorstep,\u201d she said. She defended the regulator\u2019s decision to let BT appoint Openreach\u2019s independent directors, saying they would not be affiliated to BT in any way and would be appointed and removed by BT in consultation with Ofcom. Openreach\u2019s chief executive will be appointed by its board. It will have its own strategy and set its own budget, but this will need to be signed off by BT. Ofcom said a full breakup remained an option. The regulator and BT have yet to reach agreement on the proposals, but White said they would be enforced. BT\u2019s rivals immediately criticised the proposals. TalkTalk, which is a customer of Openreach because it needs to use the BT network in order to offer broadband to customers, said Ofcom had been too cautious and that its proposals favoured BT. Dido Harding, the chief executive of TalkTalk, said a full split was needed, and believes that it will eventually happen. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to have something that is a sort of British fudge. We need a clear outcome. Britain has a second-rate infrastructure.\u201d She explained: \u201cLegal separation still means a highly complex web of regulation, and BT has proven itself expert at gaming this system. There is nothing to suggest they will not continue to do so in the new system. In taking one cautious step forward, I fear Ofcom may in practice have taken five steps back.\u201d Harding added that under the proposals Openreach would not be required to declare what dividends it paid back to BT, so it would not be clear how much profit was being handed to its owner \u201cto buy sports rights or other things\u201d. BT is a major player in football broadcasting thanks to its Premier League and Champions League rights deals, which are used as a marketing tool to lure broadband subscribers. Harding said the pension issue could be overcome, pointing to a report done by law firm Sacker &amp; Partners for Sky (pdf). She argued that Openreach would be a much more secure home for the pension fund than a company that buys football rights every few years. TalkTalk, Sky and Vodafone are launching a campaign on Wednesday to encourage consumers and businesses to write to Ofcom and \u201cmake their voices heard\u201d in the coming months, as the regulator consults on the plans with a deadline of 4 October. Sky was also critical of the proposal. The pay-TV operator\u2019s chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, said it \u201cfalls short of the full change that would have guaranteed the world-class broadband network customers expect and the UK will need. In particular, leaving Openreach\u2019s budget in the hands of BT Group raises significant questions as to whether this will really lead to the fibre investment Britain requires.\u201d Shares in BT rose more than 4% in early trading. The telecoms group welcomed the plans and said a full structural separation of Openreach would be a disproportionate move. \u201cOur proposals provide Ofcom with every benefit they\u2019re seeking but without any of the substantial and unavoidable costs associated with legal incorporation. We will continue to engage with them over the coming months.\u201d Gavin Patterson, BT\u2019s chief executive, said the group would invest \u00a36bn over the next three years in improving the UK\u2019s digital network. He said: \u201cIt is a sensible way forward. We accept that we can do better and we\u2019ve put forward a proposal that does that.\u201d As well as commercial rivals calling for action, a select committee of MPs last week said Ofcom should consider an Openreach breakup, unless BT spent more money on the service. Politicians and a former regulator joined BT\u2019s commercial rivals in criticising Ofcom for not going far enough with its plans. Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, accused Ofcom of being toothless by not forcing BT to sell Openreach. \u201cIt provides a poor service to customers and has been starved of investment. Giving more powers and investment to Openreach is better than nothing but the crucial thing is it will leave millions of customers with poor quality broadband. That is unacceptable in the modern age when the government claims to be creating a digital economy. If a watchdog yet again fails to bark, perhaps it is time to put it down.\u201d John Fingleton, a former head of the Office of Fair Trading, tweeted: \u201cIt is BT one, Ofcom nil. Conduct regulation has failed, and this is just more failure.\u201d BT has been accused of leaving millions of people with substandard broadband connections because of a failure to invest. Under the regulator\u2019s plans, Openreach would be obliged to consult formally with customers such as Sky and TalkTalk on large-scale investments. BT\u2019s CEO will not receive feedback on those discussions in order to ensure that Openreach makes impartial decisions on investment. Separately, Ofcom has begun discussions with the industry to force telecoms companies to provide automatic compensation to customers when their service falls short. The regulator has also published proposals to make it easier for mobile customers to switch network and to switch triple-play bundles (landline, broadband and pay-TV services).",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s infrastructure spending boom was already fizzling out before the Brexit vote, according to a survey of civil engineering firms that shows a slowdown in activity and order books leading up to the EU referendum. In the latest evidence that the referendum has hit business confidence and investment plans, there was also a drop in sentiment and hiring expectations among the companies that build and maintain infrastructure such as roads, railways and the energy supply. A poll by the Civil Engineering Contractors Association showed that six out of 10 subsectors reported falling workloads in the three months to the end of June, compared with the same period a year earlier. From the 101 companies surveyed, a net balance of 2% said workloads had risen in the latest quarter, a sharp decline from 20% in the previous quarter and the weakest result for three years. CECA\u2019s chief executive, Alasdair Reisner, said the recovery in infrastructure activity appeared to have been cut short. \u201cRight now we are supposed to be going hell for leather on infrastructure. There is a substantial programme of private and public investment that was supported by government ... We thought that from here on in, we were going to see speeding up of activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThese results spell real trouble for the UK economy and should act as a major warning sign to policymakers. We know that infrastructure investment is a driver of economic growth. Given the recent disappointing economic forecasts following the Brexit vote, our figures show that the market is slowing just as the country needs it to speed up.\u201d The downbeat poll results, 85% of which were collected after the referendum result was confirmed on 24 June, echo the cautious tone among manufacturers in a survey by the CBI published on Monday, which showed that optimism had slumped to its lowest level since the depths of the global recession. The first official estimates of how the economy fared in the run-up to the referendum are released on Wednesday. Figures for second quarter GDP from the Office for National Statistics are expected to show that growth held steady at a relatively muted 0.4%, according to a poll of economists by Reuters. For his sector, Reisner said, the biggest threat from a drop in confidence was to privately funded infrastructure projects. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be the public sector works where the challenge is. The issue will be the private sector taking another view and asking if the market is there or not, and wondering what will happen to the wider economy,\u201d he said. CECA, whose 300 members account for about three-quarters of UK civil engineering activity, said there had been a slowdown in orders. The net balance of surveyed firms reporting an improvement in order books fell to 9% in the second quarter, down from 13% in the first quarter, and the lowest reading since the end of 2013. Reisner said a slowdown in infrastructure spending and activity would impact the economy in several ways. There was a potential blow to hopes of rebalancing growth in the UK if building projects in the north of England were affected, he said. There were also ramifications for the UK\u2019s overall economic growth and for jobs. Construction hit hardest in last downturn He said the lesson of the last recession, which hit the construction industry harder than any other sector of the UK economy, was that continuing to spend on infrastructure could safeguard jobs. \u201cUnless the government kicks on to get spades in the ground, we will be looking at a dramatic slowdown in growth, which is bad news for the 200,000 people who work in our sector, and bad news for the economy as a whole,\u201d Reisner said. CECA does not expect any near-term drop in employment, given that most civil engineering firms would likely want to hold on to experienced workers amid a continuing skills shortage. Employment expectations for the next 12 months were the weakest for more than three years.",

There is a substantial programme of private and public investment that was supported by government ... We thought that from here on in, we were going to see speeding up of activity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThese results spell real trouble for the UK economy and should act as a major warning sign to policymakers. We know that infrastructure investment is a driver of economic growth. Given the recent disappointing economic forecasts following the Brexit vote, our figures show that the market is slowing just as the country needs it to speed up.\u201d</p> <p>The downbeat poll results, 85% of which were collected after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\">referendum result</a> was confirmed on 24 June, echo the cautious tone among manufacturers in a survey by the CBI published on Monday, which showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/manufacturers-feeling-gloomy-about-future-after-brexit-vote\">optimism had slumped to its lowest level</a> since the depths of the global recession.</p> <p>The first official estimates of how the economy fared in the run-up to the referendum are released on Wednesday. Figures for second quarter GDP from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics\">Office for National Statistics</a> are expected to show that growth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/uk-current-account-deficit-deepens-brexit-fears\">held steady at a relatively muted 0.4%</a>, according to a poll of economists by Reuters.</p> <p>For his sector, Reisner said, the biggest threat from a drop in confidence was to privately funded infrastructure projects. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be the public sector works where the challenge is. The issue will be the private sector taking another view and asking if the market is there or not, and wondering what will happen to the wider economy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>CECA, whose 300 members account for about three-quarters of UK civil engineering activity, said there had been a slowdown in orders. The net balance of surveyed firms reporting an improvement in order books fell to 9% in the second quarter, down from 13% in the first quarter, and the lowest reading since the end of 2013.</p> <p>Reisner said a slowdown in infrastructure spending and activity would impact the economy in several ways. There was a potential blow to hopes of rebalancing growth in the UK if building projects in the north of England were affected, he said. There were also ramifications for the UK\u2019s overall economic growth and for jobs.<br></p> <h2>Construction hit hardest in last downturn</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05775ac618766af451b341eeb851f5239d34fffb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05775ac618766af451b341eeb851f5239d34fffb/0_0_788_441/500.jpg\" alt=\"Office for National Statistics construction outlook chart\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The construction industry suffered a sharper decline in output than other sectors in the recession of 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said the lesson of the last recession, which hit the construction industry harder than any other sector of the UK economy, was that continuing to spend on infrastructure could safeguard jobs. \u201cUnless the government kicks on to get spades in the ground, we will be looking at a dramatic slowdown in growth, which is bad news for the 200,000 people who work in our sector, and bad news for the economy as a whole,\u201d Reisner said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf68b23a96a5be2792484451fa2064a7731033b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf68b23a96a5be2792484451fa2064a7731033b7/21_0_633_380/500.jpg\" alt=\"CECA expected employment poll\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Employment expectations for the next 12 months are the weakest since the first quarter of 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: CECA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>CECA does not expect any near-term drop in employment, given that most civil engineering firms would likely want to hold on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/24/construction-industry-apprenticeships-skilled-workers-training\">experienced workers amid a continuing skills shortage</a>.

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s biggest banks are braced for the outcome of financial health checks that could expose the extent of the weaknesses of the world\u2019s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), and send shockwaves through the markets. However, the tests \u2013 due to be published on Friday \u2013 are being viewed by some analysts as a missed opportunity to gauge the full extent of the fragility of the banking system in Europe. Only 51 banks are being assessed, compared with 124 in 2014, and they will not be given a pass or fail mark as in the past. Of the 51 banks being tested by the EU-wide European Banking Authority, only MPS failed two years ago. \u201cWe think it is a missed opportunity that the EBA 2016 stress tests will not be used to do a fuller and deeper health check of the banking system in Europe. This is especially the case as in some countries the smaller banks are the least sound. A case could have been made to include more banks rather than less,\u201d said Tomas Kinmonth, an analyst at Dutch bank Abn Amro. The fate of the Italian banks is being closely watched. \u201cItaly could provide the watershed moment for European banks. If a banking crisis were to start in Italy, we believe it would spread throughout Europe with the more levered names in the sector bearing the brunt of the pressure,\u201d said analysts at Berenberg. Analysts at Credit Suisse said that unusually the stress tests did not have a pass or fail hurdle. \u201cThe idea, we argue, is to avoid negative market reactions if a number of banks were to \u2018fail\u2019,\u201d said the analysts. The market, though, will still be able to gauge which banks are weakest when the results are published at 9pm BST on Friday. Much of the focus is on MPS, Italy\u2019s third-largest lender, which has already been bailed out twice and is regarded as needing more capital. While new EU rules mean governments can no longer bail out their banks, if MPS performs weakly in the stress test, the Italian government may be allowed to invoke so-called article 32 to stop some bondholders from incurring losses, said Kinmonth. \u201cThis article could indirectly be a positive for the Italian government, as it attempts to help domestic banks. Additionally, it gives another angle to the stress test announcement. The interpretation of the law is still not fully confirmed, especially as there is no pass/fail result in this year\u2019s stress test. However, the European commission has said it would still prefer that before any taxpayer funds are used, creditors should face losses. Discussions will come to the fore once the results of the test are released,\u201d said Kinmonth. \u201cCounterintuitively, if MPS was to \u2018fail\u2019 the test, and article 32 could be applied, it would be a major boost to Italy\u2019s third largest bank,\u201d said Kinmonth. The EBA has said the 51 banks cover approximately 70% of the EU banking sector. No banks from Portugal, Cyprus or Greece are big enough to fall within the scope of the test. The UK\u2019s biggest lenders \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC \u2013 are being assessed. The outcome of the check on Deutsche Bank will also be closely watched. The EBA said that a pass or fail label was no longer necessary: \u201cThe objective of the crisis stress tests was to identify possible capital shortfalls and require immediate recapitalisation actions. As banks have now moved to a more steady-state setting, the aim of the 2016 exercise is rather to assess remaining vulnerabilities and understand the impact of hypothetical adverse market dynamics on banks.\u201d",

Mortgage borrowing also fell between May and June, in a sign that consumers were feeling less confident as the vote approached at the end of last month. Borrowing by British companies outside the financial sectors fell by \u00a3526m last month to \u00a3262.4m, according to the latest monthly survey of high street lending by the British Banking Authority. Net mortgage borrowing fell to \u00a31.4bn in June from \u00a31.7bn in May. The number of mortgages approved for house purchase \u2013 excluding remortgages \u2013 fell by about 1,700 to 40,103.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are edging higher after positive news from the likes of BT and GKN. But housebuilders, which have been falling sharply on fears that the Brexit vote will hit the UK economy (and thus the housing market) hard, are under pressure again. Part of the reason is that analysts at Deutsche Bank have slashed their price targets albeit they are still positive on the sector. They say: Reflecting Brexit uncertainty we have reduced our forecasts for the UK Housebuilders to reflect a possible moderate downside scenario (-10% in volumes and pricing), in a bid to prove that even with these assumptions the sector offers strong investment opportunities. Our new assumptions have driven around 50% reduction in our EBIT estimates, and a near 60% reduction in profit befor tax in 2017. However despite this we forecast the sector to achieve an average return on capital employed of 15%, well above the comparable near 10% cost of capital pre tax. Government policy remains pivotal. Since 2007 new house building has been a key policy for the UK government, identifying it as a driver of economic growth, with government targeting (and reiterating since Brexit) 1m new homes 2015-2020. This target has been reiterated by government since the Brexit vote. With this in mind we see government policy as the key upside risk in our sector. The key policy which could provide upside we believe is Help to Buy equity loan where we believe a temporary increase in the equity stake taken by government to 30% (still remaining short of the 40% in the London Help to Buy product) could provide meaningful support to volumes, as could a short term stamp duty holiday at the lower end of the house price scale. But Deutsche\u2019s price target cuts, along with new figures showing mortgage approvals in June at their lowest level since March 2015, have helped push Barratt Developments 7.4p lower to 411.6p, Taylor Wimpey down 2.5p at 146.6p, Berkeley Group down 33p to \u00a325.94 and Persimmon 19p lower to \u00a316.09. BP is the biggest faller, down 12.2p at 428.15p as the company missed second quarter profit expectations amid weak refining margins and the tumbling oil price. But BT is 19p better at 406.5p on relief that regulator Ofcom had not said the company should split off its Openreach network business as a separate company. Meanwhile GKN has climbed 7.8p to 297.7p as the engineer said it was confident of its 2016 results and planned to cut costs by \u00a330m to help lift next year\u2019s figures. In a buy note Sandy Morris at Jefferies said: Staying on course and delivering on guidance (before foreign exchange) strikes us as pretty good going given the number of ebbs and flows across each division, although it is precisely what GKN has done for at least the last three years. We believe 2016 will not \u2013 as GKN guided - be a vintage year in terms of organic growth, but the things that need to happen to position GKN for good organic growth from 2017 appear to be slotting into place. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently 16.33 points higher at 6726.46, ahead of a busy week of central bank news, with the US Federal Reserve starting a two day meeting and the Bank of Japan making its latest announcement on Friday. The weak pound is providing support following renewed expectations of a UK rate cut next month. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is bouncing higher in early trade although much of the support seems to be coming through from the pound taking another beating overnight, in the wake of news that Monetary Policy Committee members are becoming increasingly keen for fresh stimulus measures to be deployed.

      "body": "<p>Leading shares are edging higher after positive news from the likes of BT and GKN.</p> <p>But housebuilders, which have been falling sharply on fears that the Brexit vote will hit the UK economy (and thus the housing market) hard, are under pressure again. Part of the reason is that analysts at Deutsche Bank have slashed their price targets albeit they are still positive on the sector. They say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Reflecting Brexit uncertainty we have reduced our forecasts for the UK Housebuilders to reflect a possible moderate downside scenario (-10% in volumes and pricing), in a bid to prove that even with these assumptions the sector offers strong investment opportunities. Our new assumptions have driven around 50% reduction in our EBIT estimates, and a near 60% reduction in profit befor tax in 2017. However despite this we forecast the sector to achieve an average return on capital employed of 15%, well above the comparable near 10% cost of capital pre tax.</p> <p>Government policy remains pivotal. Since 2007 new house building has been a key policy for the UK government, identifying it as a driver of economic growth, with government targeting (and reiterating since Brexit) 1m new homes 2015-2020. This target has been reiterated by government since the Brexit vote. With this in mind we see government policy as the key upside risk in our sector. The key policy which could provide upside we believe is Help to Buy equity loan where we believe a temporary increase in the equity stake taken by government to 30% (still remaining short of the 40% in the London Help to Buy product) could provide meaningful support to volumes, as could a short term stamp duty holiday at the lower end of the house price scale. </p> </blockquote> <p>But Deutsche\u2019s price target cuts, along with new figures showing mortgage approvals in June at their lowest level since March 2015, have helped push <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> 7.4p lower to 411.6p, <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> down 2.5p at 146.6p,<strong> Berkeley Group</strong> down 33p to \u00a325.94 and<strong> Persimmon</strong> 19p lower to \u00a316.09.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> is the biggest faller, down 12.2p at 428.15p as <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/bp-profits-plummet-44-as-oil-prices-continue-to-fall\">the company missed second quarter profit expectations amid weak refining margins and the tumbling oil price</a></strong>.</p> <p>But <strong>BT</strong> is 19p better at 406.5p on <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/26/bt-avoids-openreach-breakup-ofcom-orders-more-investment\">relief that regulator Ofcom had not said the company should split off its Openreach network business as a separate company.</a></strong></p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>GKN </strong>has climbed 7.8p to 297.7p as the engineer said it was confident of its 2016 results and planned to cut costs by \u00a330m to help lift next year\u2019s figures. In a buy note Sandy Morris at Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Staying on course and delivering on guidance (before foreign exchange) strikes us as pretty good going given the number of ebbs and flows across each division, although it is precisely what GKN has done for at least the last three years. We believe 2016 will not \u2013 as GKN guided - be a vintage year in terms of organic growth, but the things that need to happen to position GKN for good organic growth from 2017 appear to be slotting into place.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>is currently 16.33 points higher at 6726.46, ahead of a busy week of central bank news, with the US Federal Reserve starting a two day meeting and the Bank of Japan making its latest announcement on Friday.</p> <p>The weak pound is providing support following renewed expectations of a UK rate cut next month. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>London\u2019s FTSE-100 is bouncing higher in early trade although much of the support seems to be coming through from the pound taking another beating overnight, in the wake of news that Monetary Policy Committee members are becoming increasingly keen for fresh stimulus measures to be deployed. Although the Bank of England meet again to discuss rates next week, it had initially been thought that meaningful action would have to wait until we had a full quarter\u2019s worth of post-Brexit data on the table, but opinions here may now be shifting.</p> </blockquote>",
