The Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations (PSI) released a report on its investigations on Monday, before a hearing on Tuesday. The PSI has been investigating a series of tax avoidance schemes by companies including Apple and Caterpillar. The PSI called on the Treasury Department to clamp down on the practices its investigation uncovered and for the Internal Revenue Service to audit Barclays and Deutsche Bank. The 93-page report released by senators Carl Levin and John McCain centers on the use of financial products known as basket options that were sold to hedge funds and used to help reduce taxes on short-term capital gains. \u201cOver the years, this subcommittee has focused significant time and attention on two important issues: tax avoidance by profitable companies and wealthy individuals, and reckless behavior that threatens the stability of the financial system,\u201d said Levin. \u201cThis investigation brings those two themes together. These banks and hedge funds used dubious structured financial products in a giant game of \u2018let\u2019s pretend', costing the Treasury billions and bypassing safeguards that protect the economy from excessive bank lending for stock speculation.\" McCain said: \u201cAmericans are tired of large financial institutions playing by a different set of rules when it comes to paying taxes.

The subcommittee focused on options involving two of the largest basket option users, Renaissance Technology Corp and George Weiss Associates. Barclays managing director Marty Malloy, Satish Ramakrishna, the managing director at Deutsche Bank Securities, and Peter Brown, the co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies, are among the witnesses scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the Senate panel. According to the report, the banks and hedge funds used the option structure to open proprietary trading accounts in the names of the banks and \u201ccreate the fiction that the banks owned the account assets, when in fact the hedge funds exercised total control over the assets, executed all the trades, and reaped all the trading profits.\u201d The hedge funds often exercised the options shortly after the one-year mark and claimed the trading profits were eligible for the lower income tax rate that applies to long-term capital gains on assets held for at least a year.

    "webTitle": "Tesco board ousts CEO Philip Clarke after latest profit warning", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco boss Philip Clarke was brutally ousted on Monday after failing to halt a dramatic slide in sales and profits, and replaced by a little-known executive from Unilever with no retail experience. Announcing Clarke's departure alongside a fresh profit warning, the company said Dave Lewis, who presides over brands such as Dove and Lynx as head of Unilever's personal care business, would take over as chief executive in the autumn. The loss of office came out of the blue for Clarke, who was preparing to celebrate his 40th year at the company with a party in central London . This has now been cancelled. Clarke said it was an \"emotional\" time but that he had \"nothing to regret\" during his three year reign. \"[The date] is not one of my choosing,\" he told the BBC. Clarke, who joined the supermarket as a schoolboy shelf-stacker in 1974, is paying the price for failing to halt a slide in sales and profits during three years in charge. In that time he has spent more than \u00a31bn revamping its UK stores and product ranges, yet failed to stem the tide of shopper defections to rivals. In the statement, Tesco warned that sales and trading profits for the first half of the year \"were below expectations\" despite a raft of store makeovers and price cuts. When Clarke took over in March 2011 Tesco's UK market share was 30.7%, but today that has shrunk to 28.9%, according to research firm Kantar Worldpanel. During the same period, discounter Aldi has more than doubled in size to command a 4.7% share, while Lidl has increased its stake from 2.5% to 3.6%. The market positions of Sainsbury's and Asda \u2013 Tesco's main rivals \u2013 have remained largely stable. Despite his failure to turn the business round, Clarke could walk away with close to \u00a310m in cash and shares, according to proxy voting service Manifest. He has also amassed a \u00a311.5m pension pot over his long career, and will continue to be paid his \u00a31.1m salary for a year. Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent insisted Clarke's departure was not linked to the retailer's deteriorating financial performance. \"The board's job is to look forward,\" he said. \"Philip Clarke has been hugely successful in what he's done over the last three years. He's started the job of realigning the business.\" Broadbent said the board was moved to act as structural change in the retail sector \u2013 which has seen big stores fall out of fashion \u2013 accelerated. \"In these circumstances [we thought] the company might be better equipped with somebody with a fresh eye and the perspective to think more laterally and take a more decisive view of the business.\" Patrick Cescau, Tesco's senior independent director, is understood to have been a key figure in bringing about change, having been a conduit for investors' frustrations with the retailer's deteriorating performance. Paras Anand, head of European equities at Fidelity Worldwide Investment and a Tesco shareholder, said Lewis's appointment, coupled with the recent hiring of Alan Stewart from Marks &amp; Spencer as finance director, meant \"shareholders now have the change they have been pushing for\". On Monday parallels were being drawn with the succession problems encountered at Manchester United, where Sir Alex Ferguson's success was followed by David Moyes's disastrous reign, with management theory suggesting outsiders are better at leading turnarounds. Unfortunately for Clarke, he is the Moyes to Sir Terry Leahy's Ferguson. \"The decision to appoint a chief executive from outside reflects that it can sometimes be hard for insiders, especially those who have been present when a business is doing well, to be adequately attuned to when problems emerge,\" added Anand. Broadbent, whose leadership of the retailer has also been privately criticised by investors, declined to comment on the nature of the recruitment process or whether headhunters had been used. The company is thought to have been speaking to Lewis for some time. \"Dave Lewis is a man who understands brands and one of the things people are always telling me is that nobody knows what Tesco stands for,\" said Broadbent. Lewis, 49, has spent almost three decades at Unilever, and in his current role oversees a portfolio of shampoo and deodorant brands that includes supermarket favourites such as TRESemm\u00e9 and Radox. He will officially take over the reins at the start of October, with Clarke due to stay on until the end of January. Lewis will earn a salary of \u00a31.25m, plus undisclosed Tesco shares and benefits which are likely to push his pay far higher. He will also receive \u00a3525,000 in lieu of his Unilever bonus. \"I think Dave Lewis is a great hire for Tesco,\" said former Tesco board director Andy Higginson. \"He's very seasoned and a successful manager. He's got great values and will be very strong on sorting the strategy out.\" The new appointment was well received by the City, with Tesco the second biggest riser on the FTSE100, despite the profits warning, and shares closed up 1.28% at 288.6p. Shares in Tesco's rivals Morrisons and Sainsbury's lost ground though as investors took fright over the Tesco warning of a \"weak\" grocery market. In the wake of the profit alert analysts at Shore Capital pencilled in a 5-10% reduction in their profit forecast for Tesco's current financial year. The departure of Clarke marks the end of the Leahy era. Leahy ran the business for 14 years and following his retirement the key architects of Tesco's success during the nineties and noughties, including Tim Mason, former UK boss Richard Brasher, Higginson and David Potts have left. The changes mean that Tesco will go into the crucial Christmas trading period with two new people in charge. Current finance chief, Laurie McIlwee, is due to leave in October although the grocer is yet to confirm the start date for Stewart who has been lured from M&amp;S with a \u00a31.7m golden hello. Clarke, who reportedly had a tough management style, was a divisive leader and one Tesco insider argued his fate was sealed when he lost the confidence of its store managers. \"There will be no tears being shed for him at Tesco,\" said the insider.",

Current finance chief, Laurie McIlwee, is due to leave in October although the grocer is yet to confirm the start date for Stewart who has been lured from M&amp;S with a \u00a31.7m golden hello.</p> <p>Clarke, who reportedly had a tough management style, was a divisive leader and one Tesco insider argued his fate was sealed when he lost the confidence of its store managers. \"There will be no tears being shed for him at Tesco,\" said the insider.</p>",

The move comes after around 15 authorities around the world said they were investigating allegations of collusion and price manipulation in the largely unregulated currency market \u2013 which the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has suggested could prove to be a bigger scandal than the manipulation of Libor, which has cost investment banks billions of pounds in fines imposed by regulators. In a statement on Monday, the UK's anti-corruption agency confirmed: \"The director of the Serious Fraud Office has today opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraudulent conduct in the foreign exchange market.\" The allegations, which have yet to be proved, are thought to centre around traders from rival banks using internet chat rooms to collude in the fixing of benchmark prices, which are used as reference rates for trillions of dollars of investment and trade globally. Attention has focused on the benchmark price established at 4pm \u2013 ironically called the \"fix\" or the \"fixing\" \u2013 which is the price many clients request is used when they conduct foreign exchange trades, chiefly because it is considered to be transparent.

Although this shows a decline from the earlier peak, it shows investors are hoping a change at the top can revitalise the flagging business. By contrast rival supermarkets have slipped back, with Morrisons down 2.4% and J Sainsbury 1.9% lower as they brace for a price war and stronger competition from Tesco. But Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, pointed out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors can be quite keen on change when they think the man at the top has it wrong. This explains why Tesco is motoring higher today, while Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s languish near the bottom.

      "bodyText": "The market has given its verdict on Philip Clarke's proposed departure from Tesco by marking the supermarket group's shares up 3.65p or 1.2% to 288.65p, writes Nick Fletcher. Although this shows a decline from the earlier peak, it shows investors are hoping a change at the top can revitalise the flagging business. By contrast rival supermarkets have slipped back, with Morrisons down 2.4% and J Sainsbury 1.9% lower as they brace for a price war and stronger competition from Tesco. But Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, pointed out: Investors can be quite keen on change when they think the man at the top has it wrong. This explains why Tesco is motoring higher today, while Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s languish near the bottom. However, you can\u2019t change bosses every day, and the new man is going to have only a short honeymoon period before he is expected to deliver. Overall though the continuing repercussions over the shooting down of Malaysian jet MH17 over Ukraine, the prospect of tougher sanctions against Russia and the violence in Gaza have all combined to send global markets lower. The final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 21.01 points or 0.31% lower at 6728.44 \u2022 Germany's Dax has dropped 1.01% to 9623.67 \u2022 France's Cac closed down 0.67% at 4306.12 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB fell 1.48% to 20,431.20 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended down 0.43% at 10,482.0 Over in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 90 points or 0.53% lower. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. And here's the full Reuters story on the SFO criminal investigation into alleged currency market manipulation: Britain's anti-fraud agency said on Monday it has launched a criminal investigation into alleged rigging of the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market.\"The Director of the Serious Fraud Office has today opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraudulent conduct in the foreign exchange market,\" the agency said in a statement. Around 15 authorities around the world are investigating allegations of collusion and price manipulation in the largely unregulated foreign exchange market. It is alleged that traders used online chatrooms to collude in the fixing of benchmark prices, which are used as reference rates for trillions of dollars of investment and trade globally. Breaking news from Reuters: 21-Jul-2014 14:58 - UK SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE SAYS HAS OPENED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED CURRENCY MARKET MANIPULATION 21-Jul-2014 14:59 - SFO SAYS CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO \"ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUDULENT CONDUCT IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET\" The International Monetary Fund has just given Germany a glowing review in its yearly economic health check (my colleague Julia Kollewe reports): Describing Europe's largest economy as \"an anchor of regional stability,\" the IMF said: \"A recovery is under way, led by domestic demand and underpinned by healthy corporate and household balance sheets, a strong labor market, a much improved fiscal position, and accommodative financial conditions. As growth returned in mid-2013, the unemployment rate reached a post-unification low, while the labor force continues to expand on the back of strong immigration and increasing participation.\" The current account surplus reached a new high last year. Credit growth, however, has been lacklustre, the IMF noted, reflecting low demand despite an upturn in the housing market. The Washington-based organisation is predicting 1.9% growth this year and 1.7% next (compared with just 0.5% last year). It cautioned that Germany's medium-term growth prospects remain subdued against a weak international backdrop, lingering uncertainty about future energy costs and looming demographic changes. Inflation, which has been on a downward trend reflecting falling import prices and contained wage pressures (with core inflation stable around 1.2%), is expected to pick up and remain above that in the rest of the eurozone. Reassuring for Germany, after the Bundesbank warned this morning that the economy may have stagnated in Q2.... The other big news today is that Germany's central bank has predicted that its economy has probably stalled in the last quarter. The Bundesbank said this morning that industrial output and construction weakened in April-June, which means its GDP may not have expanded at all. And that means the wider eurozone probably hasn't achieved substantial growth, having only expanded by 0.2% in January-March. More here. Shares in Tesco have jumped this morning after chief executive Phil Clarke's troubled three-year stint running Britain's largest supermarket chain came to an ignominious end. \u2022 Tesco's shares are leading the FTSE 100 risers this afternoon, up 2% at 290p, as analysts show optimism that his successor, Dave Lewis of Unilever, can revive the company's fortunes. \u2022 Clarke has told the BBC that he feels an \"\"enormous sense of relief\" at the news. But the announcement means a party to celebrate his 40 years at Tesco has been cancelled. \u2022 Clarke's shock departure (he steps aside in October) was announced to the City this morning, alongside another warning from Tesco that sales and profits have not hit expectations in June and July. \u2022 Clarke has paid the price for failing to improve Tesco's UK stores fast enough, or to give the company a clear identity. As City firm Bernstein explained: If you want cheap food, there is a better alternative next door (Asda, Aldi, Lidl), if you want great quality the same applies (Sainsbury, M&amp;S, Waitrose). Tesco responded by trying to be 'bit better at everything' but that doesn't change the local trade-off consumers face. \u2022 Lewis could now take \"aggressive action\" against discount supermarkets, analysts suggest. Veteran commentator Nick Bubb reckons Lewis -- who has enjoyed a successful career at Unilever -- has the skills to win a price war. But Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, has warned that such turnaround plans can end in tears. The majority of radical turnarounds actually end up making matters worse, not better. \u2022 Corporate governance firm Manifest has calculated that Clarke could receive almost \u00a39m in pay and bonuses when he leaves. And here's our full coverage of the Tesco shake-up News story: Tesco boss Philip Clarke quits after another profit warning Analysis: Philip Clarke fiddled while Tesco burned Profile: \"Drastic Dave' Lewis to take control of Tesco Dave Lewis's in-tray: The five problems facing Tesco's new CEO Tesco CEO Philip Clarke quits: what the analysts say What are the biggest problems facing Dave Lewis? Well, there's the discount super-markets, undercutting Tesco on price. It still has too many big out-of-town megastores, when shoppers are defecting to smaller outlets. Its TV adverts aren't a patch on the old ones. Those of a certain age have happy memories of Dudley Moore chasing a chicken around France, and Prunella Scales playing everyone's favourite daft mother. ....the brand is confused (is Tesco about value, or quality?), and the Clubcard loyalty scheme has been usurped by rivals. Tesco should issue Lewis with an extra-large in-tray. More here: Five problems for Tesco's new boss to deal with Dave Lewis is being billed as a turnaround specialist, but pulling off a major rescue plan is harder than investors care to believe. So warns Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, \u201cClarke has been a dead man working for months. This was mainly because the investor community continually bayed for blood. He had been a steady hand on the rudder. But vocal investors wanted radical transformation instead. The problem is such radical plans sound exciting when announced on a conference call with analysts, but are much more difficult to put into practice. The result is that the majority of radical turnarounds actually end up making matters worse, not better. Spicer also reaches for a sporting comparison to explain why Liverpool fan Phil Clarke struggled to replace Sir Terry Leahy: \u201cClarke suffered the same fate as David Moyes. Taking over from a legendary leader is very difficult. The new person in the job is bound to disappoint. This is because stakeholders often have unreasonably high expectations which incoming candidates often fail to live up to. They struggle to get out of the shadow of their heroic predecessor and end up being kicked out the door quickly. Phil Clarke's big blunder was not to move faster to end Tesco's overseas expansions and get to grips ASAP with its ailing UK operation. So argues our Business Editor Julia Finch, who writes: How wrong Clarke was when he boasted of inheriting a \"golden legacy\" from Leahy back in 2011. The fact is the UK stores had been woefully underinvested. They had become unpleasant places to shop, with long queues at the tills. The entire Tesco shopping experience had become so poor that within a year of taking over Clarke was forced to come up with a \u00a31bn programme to fix the core UK estate \u2013 hiring more shop staff and improving ranges, quality and stores. Clarke said he needed to put \"the love\" back into the shops. It is a job still far from done. Here's her full analysis: Philip Clarke fiddled while Tesco burned My colleague Jennifer Rankin has swiftly pulled together a profile of Tesco's new boss - here's a flavour: Dave Lewis, a veteran of the consumer goods giant Unilever, is the first outsider to take charge of Tesco since founder Jack Cohen began selling groceries on an east London stall in 1919. The appointment of a marketing man with no top-level experience of working in a supermarket shows the depth of shareholders' alarm over the grocer's sinking market share. Dave Lewis joined Unilever in 1987 as a graduate trainee fresh from Trent Polytechnic and had an early success with the UK launch of Dove soap in 1992. He rapidly moved up the ranks, with stints in Latin America, Indonesia and central Europe, along the way completing an elite management course at Harvard University. In 2005, he returned to Britain to take charge of Unilever's toiletries division in the UK, eventually being promoted to run the UK and Ireland business, where he was in charge of brands such as Knorr stock cubes, Pot Noodle and Cornetto ice-cream This brought him to the attention of the Conservative party which, then in opposition, appointed Lewis to chair a business taskforce on obesity..... More here: New Tesco CEO Dave Lewis - profile We're collecting all the best reaction to the shake-up at Tesco here: Tesco CEO Philip Clarke quits: what the analysts say This chart shows how Tesco has lost market share in recent years, with discount chain Aldi growing at a similar rate (note the double y-axis) Via Naomi Kerbel of Sky News. Dave Lewis will also be well-rewarded for taking charge of Tesco. He'll receive a basic salary of \u00a31.25m, but Tesco has also promised his cash bonus of \u00a3525,000, and also various deferred share awards from Unilever. These share awards are meant to ensure top management are committed to a company's long-term success. But often, other firms are quite prepared to match them when necessary. Paddy Power reports that one of its punters has won \u00a3700, betting that Dave Lewis would replace Phil Clarke. How much money will Phil Clarke walk away with from Tesco? Manifest, the corporate governance firm, has crunched the numbers, and reckons the outgoing CEO is entitled to salary, share schemes and bonuses worth \u00a39.6m (or almost \u00a37m if he doesn't receive a cash bonus this year) Here's the details, which highlight the various ways CEO's are \"incentivised', and how they can still be well rewarded even if things end badly. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP): Clarke holds 1,852,211 unvested shares in the Company's LTIP, based on yesterday's share price of \u00a32.85, these awards have the potential value of \u00a35,278,801. OPTIONS: He also holds a total of 1,904,558 vested but unexercised share options, these options have exercise prices (varying between \u00a33.1275 and \u00a34.7375) which are currently higher than the current share price of the Company. These will lapse 12 month's after Clarke's departure if unexercised. DEFERRED BONUS SHARES: 398,961, which have a value of \u00a31,137,039. BASIC SALARY: \u00a31,145,000, although in the Annual Report the Company state that salaries were to be reviewed in July, so his salary may be higher, CEO salaries are rising on a range of 3%, on average. Clarke is entitled to 12-month salary in lieu of notice. TOTAL REMUNERATION: Based on the above the total amount Clarke will receive on leaving the Company is \u00a36,988,340, assuming a share price of \u00a32.85. CASH BONUS: Clarke took no bonus last year, however based on a departure at the end of January, as stated in the RNA, a total pro rated bonus could be \u00a32,623,958. TOTAL PACKAGE: We estimate the total figure to be \u00a39,612,298 \u2013 excluding pension and the underwater options. Those options could, however, be back in the money if Dave Lewis\u2019s appointment pulls the share price back up again. UPDATE: It feels unlikely that Clarke will pick up a cash bonus this year, given Tesco's warning on sales and profits this morning..... Here's our timeline of Tesco's triumphs and travails since 1974, when Phil Clarke started stacking shelves at his local store as a schoolboy: Tesco timeline \u2013 the highs and lows of the UK's biggest retailer It's official - a Tesco spokeswoman has confirmed that the party scheduled for tomorrow to celebrate Phil Clarke's 40 years at the supermarket has been cancelled (via PA). Analysts at City firm Bernstein are very concerned that Tesco has hit its shareholders with another profits warning today (admitting that sales and profits are below forecasts in June and July). They say: This is confirmation that their current turnaround strategy ('Be a bit better at Everything') is not working. Bernstein also flags up that Tesco, once so powerful, has been squeezed on all sides: If you want cheap food, there is a better alternative next door (Asda, Aldi, Lidl), if you want great quality the same applies (SBRY, M&amp;S, Waitrose). Tesco responded by trying to be 'bit better at everything' but that doesn't change the local trade-off consumers face. My colleague Sarah Butler suggests that Dave Lewis may bring some of Unilever's green credentials to Tesco: The party hats and streamers have been put away, alas: Phil Clarke had resisted launching a full-blown price war against the likes of Aldi and Lidl; will Dave Lewis have a different view? Keith Bowman, equity enalyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says Lewis could challenge the discount rivals: The march of the discounters Aldi and Lidl continues, whilst Tesco\u2019s prior advantage in the form of its overseas operations is not what it once was. The question now will be whether the new Chief Executive will have the courage to take early aggressive action, potentially going toe to toe with the discounters and impacting earnings, at least in the short term. Caroline Hyde, Bloomberg's European business correspondent, says Dave Lewis \"knows Tesco intimately\" - having negotiated with the company for many years as a senior Unilever executive (as explained earlier). There's sympathy for Philip Clarke from Neil Saunders, managing director of Conlumino (retail research agency and consultancy): Analysts at Shore Capital have raised their rating on Tesco's shares, via Reuters: 21-Jul-2014 08:45 - TESCO: SHORE RAISES TO HOLD FROM SELL RATING Veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb says that Phil Clarke's departure is \"a shock\", especially as it was accompanied by another profit warning. Bubb makes the important point that Clarke received a \"very poor\" legacy from his predecessor, Sir Terry Leahy -- but this latest profit warning must be the last straw. As Bubb puts it: We\u2019ve always thought that Phil Clarke was a street-fighter, and his inheritance from the once highly regarded Terry Leahy was very poor (with the core UK business milked dry to finance the foolish escapade in the US), but he was always going to find it hard to survive another profit warning. Bubb adds that Lewis will bring vital experience of winning tough price wars: Dave Lewis knows nothing about retailing, but maybe that doesn\u2019t matter, because as a leading supplier he certainly knows how to win price wars and perhaps that is the big issue now facing Tesco in the UK. That may explain why supermarket chain Morrisons is leading the FTSE 100 fallers -- it has been pushing price cuts hard in a bid to revive its own fortunes. There's a short profile of Dave Lewis on Unilever's site too (from where I cropped this rather blurry photo). It explains that Lewis posted growth of 30% when he was running Unilever's South East Asian operations, despite \"political unrest and hyperinflation\". What do we know about Dave Lewis, the man charged with steering Britain's largest supermarket to a brighter future? Well, he joined Unilever in 1987, after studying at Trent Polytechnic in 1987, and appears to have spent his whole working life there - mainly in marketing and customer management roles. Career highlights include launching Dove, the soap brand, in the UK in 1992. He's also worked in Europe, South America and Asia -- including as managing director at Unilever Indonesia's personal care business, and as marketing director of River Plate. Lewis is currently president of \"Personal Care for Skin, Deodorants, Oral &amp; Hair\" at Unilever. In May, he told Unilever staff that their Personal Care vision was based on the idea that \"all people are beautiful; rather than made beautiful.\" Shares in Tesco jumped as much as 3% in volatile early trading, as the London stock market opens. City investors appear to be hoping that Dave Lewis can turn Tesco's around, rather than fretting about this morning's warning that sales and profits are below expectations. And shares in two rivals, J Sainsbury and Morrisons, are falling - both down around 1.5%. Reading between the lines, it appears that Tesco's board decided that Philip Clarke had to go, and he didn't argue. Sir Richard Broadbent told the City that: \"Having guided Tesco through a substantial re-positioning in challenging markets, Philip Clarke agreed with the Board that this is the appropriate moment to hand over to a new leader with fresh perspectives and a new profile. Broadbent added that Clarke had contributed a lot to Tesco over some 40 years. Philip has done a huge amount to set a clear direction and re-position Tesco to meet the rapid changes taking place in the retail market. He has achieved a great deal across all areas of the business in the face of considerable pressures. The Board are deeply grateful to Philip for his contribution to Tesco, over the last four decades, as well as more recently as Chief Executive. His has been an outstanding achievement. Philip Clarke's departure comes less than a month after a bruising annual general meeting. Tesco shareholders had criticised the company's poor performance after seeing sales slump 3.8% in the last three months. Chairman Richard Broadbent had pleaded for patience, insisting that Clarke's turnaround plan would work.... but it now appears that shareholders have had enough: Josh Raymond, analyst at City Index, highlights the reasons why Clarke had to go: Very decent quotes from Philip Clarke this morning -- offering full-throated support to his successor. Clarke says: \"Having taken the business through the huge challenges of the last few years, I think this is the right moment to hand over responsibility and I am delighted that Dave Lewis has agreed to join us. Dave has worked with Tesco directly or indirectly over many years and is well-known within the business. I will do everything in my power to support him in taking the company forward through the next stage of its journey.\" Breaking news: Tesco, Britain's largest supermarket, has announced that chief executive Philip Clarke is leaving the company -- and hit shareholders with another profit warning. Clarke, who has faced growing criticism for Tesco's recent underperformance, is to step down on the first of October. He's been succeeded by Dave Lewis, president of Personal Care at Unilever. Clarke has been battling for months to turn Tesco around -- but today's statement shows that the company is still struggling. Tesco admitted: Current trading conditions are more challenging than we anticipated at the time of our first quarter interim management statement on 4th June. The overall market is weaker and, combined with the increasing investments we are making to improve the customer offer and to build long term loyalty, this means that sales and trading profit in the first half of the year are somewhat below expectation. Clarke has clearly been under pressure for some time --- last month, the company reported its worst sales in decades. But the news of his departure is still a major shock today. Details and reaction to follow -- including a profile of Lewis. Can he succeed where Philip Clarke struggled?.....

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/21/tesco-boss-philip-clarke-quits-profits-warning\" title=\"\">Tesco's new boss Dave Lewis</a> will have a bulging inbox. Here are five major problems he needs to gets to grips with:</p> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The recession upset the status quo in the UK grocery industry as it made German discounters Aldi and Lidl, with their rock-bottom prices, a socially acceptable place to shop. Yet Tesco has been slowfooted in its response to this new threat, with the \u00a3200m price cuts initiative announced earlier this year deemed too little too late. In February Philip Clarke formally abandoned Tesco's industry-leading profit margin target but at the same time he has proved reluctant to get out the big bazooka and blast rivals out of the water on price. Clarke's reticence has cost him millions of shopping trips and new boss Lewis, with no ties to the uber-profitable Leahy regime, could reset the profitability of the whole grocery industry by going to war on price. As the industry adage goes: anyone can start a price war but \u2013 at nearly twice the size of its nearest rival \u2013 only Tesco can win.</p> <h2>Big stores</h2> <p>The scale of Tesco's big store problem was underlined last week when it started renting out car park spaces to the car hire firm Avis. Clarke was quick to acknowledge that big stores were increasingly becoming \"white elephants\" as shoppers turned to the internet and convenience stores for smaller top-up shops. At its AGM last month Clarke said wistfully that if Tesco was just an internet and convenience store retailer, \"we would be shooting the lights out\". But it's not. It has 247 Extras and for the last year has been subletting space to other retailers as well as adding bells and whistles such as Giraffe restaurants, Harris + Hoole coffee shops, soft play centres and even gyms in a bid to attract shoppers. The ongoing major refurbishment programme has not moved the dial on sales and Lewis may have to implement more radical surgery.</p> <h2>Marketing</h2> <p>From Dudley Moore hunting for free-range chickens in rural France to Prunella Scales's busybody shopper Dotty Turnbull, Tesco's marketeers used to be able to put their finger on the nation's pulse. But more recent campaigns have been badly executed \u2013 see 2011's Big Price Drop or Big Price Flop as it came to be known \u2013 or baffling, as in the case of last year's ads featuring viking warrior Borg picking out online orders. Some analysts point to the departure of Tim Mason \u2013 the former marketing director and deputy chief executive who left in 2012 \u2013 who decamped to the US to run the ill-fated Fresh &amp; Easy chain as the reason for this weakness. He was credited with knowing what made Tesco's UK shoppers tick and without him the grocer seems to have lost its ability to judge the nation's mood.</p> <h2>Brand</h2> <p>\"When we get it right, we've been loved and respected by consumers,\" said Clarke earlier this year. Tesco's success during the nineties and noughties was built on being an \"everyman\" with its 20-year-old slogan \"Every little Helps\" supposed to describe all the big and little things it did right for shoppers, from fixing wonky trolleys to lowering food prices. But there was also a growing perception that Tesco did lots of things wrong on the road to becoming the country's biggest retailer. It was accused of squeezing suppliers and its rapacious expansion was seen to come at a cost for independents and communities leading to the sobriquet Tescopoly. And it is only now as the tide goes out on big stores that aggressive growth has come back to bite.</p> <p>Being an \"everyman\" is no longer good enough in a market increasingly polarised by price. Of the big four supermarket chains Asda, with its \"everyday low prices\", and Sainsbury's promise of \"value and values\" ploughed a firm course during the recession while Tesco and its smaller rival Morrisons were hammered by shoppers for not being the best at either price or quality. What Tesco stands for these days is hard to pinpoint and an existential crisis Lewis will need to have an answer for.</p> <h2>Loyalty</h2> <p>Clubcard used to be Tesco's not-so-secret weapon. In a time before \"big data\" was a buzz word, Dunnhumby, the Tesco-backed researcher, was able to turn the reams of sales data whirring through its tills into an invaluable look inside shoppers' heads.

      "bodyText": "Tesco's new boss Dave Lewis will have a bulging inbox. Here are five major problems he needs to gets to grips with: Price The recession upset the status quo in the UK grocery industry as it made German discounters Aldi and Lidl, with their rock-bottom prices, a socially acceptable place to shop. Yet Tesco has been slowfooted in its response to this new threat, with the \u00a3200m price cuts initiative announced earlier this year deemed too little too late. In February Philip Clarke formally abandoned Tesco's industry-leading profit margin target but at the same time he has proved reluctant to get out the big bazooka and blast rivals out of the water on price. Clarke's reticence has cost him millions of shopping trips and new boss Lewis, with no ties to the uber-profitable Leahy regime, could reset the profitability of the whole grocery industry by going to war on price. As the industry adage goes: anyone can start a price war but \u2013 at nearly twice the size of its nearest rival \u2013 only Tesco can win. Big stores The scale of Tesco's big store problem was underlined last week when it started renting out car park spaces to the car hire firm Avis. Clarke was quick to acknowledge that big stores were increasingly becoming \"white elephants\" as shoppers turned to the internet and convenience stores for smaller top-up shops. At its AGM last month Clarke said wistfully that if Tesco was just an internet and convenience store retailer, \"we would be shooting the lights out\". But it's not. It has 247 Extras and for the last year has been subletting space to other retailers as well as adding bells and whistles such as Giraffe restaurants, Harris + Hoole coffee shops, soft play centres and even gyms in a bid to attract shoppers. The ongoing major refurbishment programme has not moved the dial on sales and Lewis may have to implement more radical surgery. Marketing From Dudley Moore hunting for free-range chickens in rural France to Prunella Scales's busybody shopper Dotty Turnbull, Tesco's marketeers used to be able to put their finger on the nation's pulse. But more recent campaigns have been badly executed \u2013 see 2011's Big Price Drop or Big Price Flop as it came to be known \u2013 or baffling, as in the case of last year's ads featuring viking warrior Borg picking out online orders. Some analysts point to the departure of Tim Mason \u2013 the former marketing director and deputy chief executive who left in 2012 \u2013 who decamped to the US to run the ill-fated Fresh &amp; Easy chain as the reason for this weakness. He was credited with knowing what made Tesco's UK shoppers tick and without him the grocer seems to have lost its ability to judge the nation's mood. Brand \"When we get it right, we've been loved and respected by consumers,\" said Clarke earlier this year. Tesco's success during the nineties and noughties was built on being an \"everyman\" with its 20-year-old slogan \"Every little Helps\" supposed to describe all the big and little things it did right for shoppers, from fixing wonky trolleys to lowering food prices. But there was also a growing perception that Tesco did lots of things wrong on the road to becoming the country's biggest retailer. It was accused of squeezing suppliers and its rapacious expansion was seen to come at a cost for independents and communities leading to the sobriquet Tescopoly. And it is only now as the tide goes out on big stores that aggressive growth has come back to bite. Being an \"everyman\" is no longer good enough in a market increasingly polarised by price. Of the big four supermarket chains Asda, with its \"everyday low prices\", and Sainsbury's promise of \"value and values\" ploughed a firm course during the recession while Tesco and its smaller rival Morrisons were hammered by shoppers for not being the best at either price or quality. What Tesco stands for these days is hard to pinpoint and an existential crisis Lewis will need to have an answer for. Loyalty Clubcard used to be Tesco's not-so-secret weapon. In a time before \"big data\" was a buzz word, Dunnhumby, the Tesco-backed researcher, was able to turn the reams of sales data whirring through its tills into an invaluable look inside shoppers' heads. But Clubcard has lost \u2013 or has been allowed to lose \u2013 its potency. The value of the scheme to shoppers started to get confused when Tesco started offering \"double\" points and over time it has been drowned out by \"price promises\", the forest of paper vouchers spewed out by supermarket checkouts as well as the march of rival Nectar. Not long after he took the helm Clarke promised to put Dunnhumby back at the heart of Tesco but there has been little sign that he has made good on that promise.",

He has achieved a great deal across all areas of the business in the face of considerable pressures.\" Clarke, who just six weeks ago said he had no plans to leave Tesco, said on Monday: \"Having taken the business through the huge challenges of the last few years, I think this is the right moment to hand over responsibility and I am delighted that Dave Lewis has agreed to join us.\" The departure of Clarke means that Tesco will go into the crucial Christmas trading period with two new people at the top. The chief financial officer, Laurie McIlwee, is due to leave the supermarket in October, having announced his departure in April, following rumours of differences with Clarke. The supermarket has lured Alan Stewart of Marks &amp; Spencer, with a \u00a31.7m golden hello, to replace McIlwee. Lewis, 49, has spent almost three decades at Unilever, where he has been UK chairman and president for the Americas. He is currently global president of personal care. Keith Bowman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said the appointment of an outsider provided some hope, but added that the task of the new chief executive was sizeable. \"The march of the discounters Aldi and Lidl continues, whilst Tesco's prior advantage in the form of its overseas operations is not what it once was. The question now will be whether the new chief executive will have the courage to take early aggressive action.\" Shares in Tesco's rivals Morrisons and Sainsbury's fell on Monday, as investors took fright over the Tesco warning of a \"weak\" grocery market.",

      "bodyText": "The prices demanded by sellers putting their homes on the market have fallen for the first time this year, in the latest sign that some of the heat is coming out of the UK housing market. The average asking price fell by 0.8%, or \u00a32,116, to \u00a3270,159 in July, according to the property website Rightmove. It was the first monthly drop since December and compared with a 0.3% rise in July 2013. Miles Shipside, director at Rightmove, said the fall could partly be explained by a normal summer lull, but that stricter mortgage rules and heightened expectations of an interest rate rise sooner rather than later may also have played a part. He said: \"A price fall in July is not unexpected as prospective buyers turn their attention to the summer holidays, not to mention the added distraction of an engaging World Cup. \"Buyer confidence may also have taken a knock with suggestions that mortgages are becoming harder to get and repayments may get more costly sooner than originally anticipated, should the rumours of an interest rate rise before the next election come true.\" The fall in asking prices was widespread across England and Wales, and included the south-east and Greater London, which are the most expensive regions. The only areas to record a rise in July were the north -west, the west Midlands and East Anglia. Lower asking prices in July pulled the annual rate of growth down to 6.5% from 7.7%. It was the latest sign that frenetic activity in the housing market might be easing off. Mortgage approvals fell for a fourth month in May, according to Bank of England data, and earlier this month, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said there was a heightened sense of caution in the market. Despite July's fall, Rightmove is now expecting average asking prices to rise by 8% in 2014 overall, which is at the top end of its earlier forecast for an increase of 6-8%. It said a combination of lack of supply in the most popular areas in and around London, a strengthening market in northern cities such as Manchester, Leeds, York and Liverpool, and a proliferation of cash-rich third-time buyers, would underpin asking prices for the remainder of the year. The average time it took to sell a property fell to 65 days in the second quarter of the year, from 75 days a year earlier.Shipside said that while figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals have slowed since late 2013, they were higher in the year to date compared with the same period last year. \"Market conditions still compare favourably with this time last year, with growth in both the economy and employment, plus a comparative thaw in mortgage availability. The 'year to move' window looks likely to be open for a while longer yet, though we expect market activity will slow down in the run-up to the election in May next year.\" One of the key drivers of rising house prices over recent months has been a lack of properties coming onto the market. Rightmove said that although supply was 10% higher in 2014 so far than the same period in 2013, Britain was still suffering from a structural deficit in housing stock, with demand outstripping supply in the more popular areas. Demand in the first half was up 27%, to an average of 3.7m enquiries per month.",

The abolition of the carbon tax and the inability of the government to end the mining tax will see a larger deficit than was expected. But as a recent report showed, it won\u2019t hinder Australia\u2019s position as a great place for mining companies to invest. There was a pretty high level of stupidity flying around parliament last week. We had the carbon tax being abolished but the compensation that accompanied it being retained; and we had the government wanting to remove the mining resources rent tax (MRRT) but also get rid of the compensation. This meant that the government was often using an argument for one that contradicted the other. For example Liberal MP Sarah Henderson opened her speech on the carbon tax repeal bill arguing that \u201cwe are concerned about the cost that this tax is causing to our economy. We are concerned about the way in which the previous Labor government drove up the debt and the deficit\u201d. This was a rather curious opening attack given the carbon tax raises over $7bn a year. Even if the revenue were to drop once Australia shifted to the European carbon price, it still created a big hole given the government is keeping many compensation measures. In total the cost to the budget was estimated in the legislation to be $7.55bn over the forward estimates. The day after the carbon tax was abolished however, Eric Abetz told the Senate that \u201cit would be nice to live in a world of magic pudding where we did not have to raise any taxes but could expend a lot of money and spread largesse to the Australian population\u201d. Largesse brought in to compensate for the carbon price I guess is not one of the ingredients in the magic pudding recipe. In the same vein, the prime minister, Tony Abbott, told ABC\u2019s AM: \u201cWe said that we would abolish the mining tax but we would also abolish the spending that the tax was supposed to fund. You can\u2019t get rid of the tax responsibly without also getting rid of the spending.\u201d Well quite. One of the problems with the mining tax was that the spending measures the ALP linked with the tax, such as the schoolkids bonus, the low-income superannuation contribution and the income support bonus, cost more than the tax raised. So the ALP introduced a tax that raised less revenue than the amount spent on associated expenditure, and the LNP abolished a tax that raised more revenue than the amount spent on associated expenditure. Australian politics in a nutshell. With the mining tax remaining in place, the rhetoric that it kills mining investment and jobs will continue. NSW Mining for example has already suggested that \u201cthe MRRT has failed to raise any significant revenue for Australian taxpayers and threatens mining investment in NSW\u201d. They are right, the MRRT has failed to raise significant revenue \u2013 a mere $170m in the last financial year, compared to the expected $3.5bn that was predicted when it was introduced. But it\u2019s an odd argument that a tax which isn\u2019t raising any tax \u2013 and thus not costing the industry greatly \u2013 is also apparently greatly hurting the industry. The reality is the MRRT has not cruelled mining investment in Australia. Last month, mining investment consultant, Behre Dolbear released its annual ranking of countries for mining investment. The report oddly got scant coverage in the media \u2013 only Bernard Keane in Crikey gave it any real coverage. The report found that Australia had slipped in the rankings of best place in the world to invest from first to second, being taken over by Canada: The reason for our fall however was not because of any penalty due to the MRRT or the carbon tax but because Canada, which had been ranked second for the past four years, was given improved rankings in certain areas. The report marks countries against seven criteria: economic system, political system, social issues, permitting delays, currency stability, corruption and tax regime. Australia ranked in the top three in all categories, and is ranked highest (or equal highest) for our economic system, social issues, currency stability, corruption and tax regime. Yes our tax regime, which at the time of this report included both the MRRT and carbon tax, was rated as the best in the world. The report noted of taxation that in recent times countries have been exploring ways to increase revenue from mineral production. It suggests \u201cthe inspiration for these efforts may have been bolstered by Australia\u2019s actions over the past year to increase taxes, both directly and indirectly on mining operations\u201d. And yet the report actually boosted our ranking on tax regime up three points from 5 to 8, putting us equal best with Canada. Back in 2011 Behre Dolbear did downgrade our tax regime score because the \u201cdebate about a minerals resources rent tax ... raised uncertainty about its tax policies\u201d. Given there is no longer any uncertainty about how the MRRT works (and possibly how little impact it has had), Australia\u2019s ranking on tax is now higher than it was in 2010. The reason Canada improved was because of a jump in its score on \u201csocial issues\u201d and \u201cpermitting delays\u201d. The main factor for this was Behre Dolbear\u2019s displeasure of \u201cthe \u201cNimby\u201d (Not In My Backyard) syndrome, where personal prosperity outweighs public\u2019s necessity for minerals\u201d. Whereas it suggests Canada\u2019s situation has improved, the campaigns against coal seam gas in NSW and Queensland (such as the \u201clock the gate\u201d campaign) saw Behre Dolbear fail to improve our ranking on such issues \u2013 though given we scored nine for social issues and eight for permitting delays, there\u2019s not much higher we can go. Indeed the CEO of Behre Dolbear, Karr McCurdy, wrote in Forbes that \u201cthe average time to bring a US mine through permitting and into production remains at over seven to 10 years \u2014 significantly longer than resource-rich fellow industrial democracies Canada and Australia\u201d. Given how linked investment is to the price of the minerals being mined, Australian mining investment has actually held up well since the MRRT (and carbon tax) came into effect: So while the events of last week may hurt the budget, let us not hear any palaver about how keeping the mining tax is killing investment.",
