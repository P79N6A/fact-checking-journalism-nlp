      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned that the task of regulating the City after Brexit will put a strain on its ability to police the financial sector. Deputy governor Sam Woods also said the Bank\u2019s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, faced \u201ca material risk to its objectives\u201d \u2013 which include promoting financial stability \u2013 as it deals with the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. Woods warned of a \u201cmaterial extra burden\u201d on the PRA if it had to regulate more financial firms as they made plans to cope with Brexit. \u201cIt is incumbent on us to manage this burden but we may have to make some difficult prioritisation decisions in order to accommodate it,\u201d said Woods, chief executive of the PRA. In a letter to Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP and new head of the Treasury select committee, Woods also described handling the fallout from Brexit as a top priority for the PRA. Backing calls from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for a transitional exit deal, Woods added: \u201cSome form of implementation period is desirable in order to give UK and EU firms more time to make the necessary changes to adjust to the UK\u2019s new relationship with the EU in an orderly way.\u201d He also outlined the risks contained in the Bank\u2019s half-yearly assessment of financial stability, in which it warned that business conducted in the City could fragment across other financial centres, pushing up the costs to the EU and the UK. It also warned of the risk to the UK economy from potential disruption to trade and the need for banks to be braced for higher bad debt charges if loans turned sour owing to Brexit-related economic turbulence. Morgan wrote to Woods last month to ask for details of the City\u2019s readiness for a hard Brexit. In his reply, Woods said the PRA was scrutinising the plans of 401 City firms to ensure each one was ready for Brexit and also to establish iwhether there were \u201cbroader financial stability risks, which could arise from the collective execution of the contingency plans\u201d. Woods did not provide details of the individual plans the Bank had demanded by 14 July. However, firms have begun to reveal how they intend to cope with the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. For instance, RBS is preparing to expand in Amsterdam; Barclays and Bank of America are moving staff to Dublin; while Morgan Stanley has picked Frankfurt. The PRA said it was necessary to ask firms how they would cope with a hard Brexit \u2013 or no exit agreement with the EU \u2013 to reduce the risk of \u201cunexpected breaks\u201d in provision of financial services such as loans to firms and consumers. Woods told Morgan the Bank would \u201ccontinue to develop and refine its assessment of the potential stability risks associated with the withdrawal\u201d from the EU. He also said the information received from firms showed some faced significant issues in amending contracts to cope with Brexit. Firms restructuring after Brexit could be more difficult to regulate, he added, because they would have operations in the UK and the EU. As she published his letter, Morgan said: \u201cThe UK leaving the European Union is a complex task. The potential extra burden on the PRA\u2019s resources, and the risk that may pose to its objectives, is an issue I\u2019m sure the committee will want to monitor.\u201d The Bank may end up regulating more firms if there is no deal on passporting, the system through which some insurance companies and banks based in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway are able to operate in the UK without Bank of England authorisation. In the banking sector, for instance, about 7o firms operate this way, so they may need to gain authorisation from the PRA if they want to keep doing business in the UK. The PRA is funded by the firms it regulates and has asked for \u00a35.4m more to meet its annual requirement, which stands at \u00a3267m for the current financial year. It has warned it may need to ask for more if the biggest risks around Brexit crystallise.",

      "bodyText": "One of the world\u2019s largest automotive firms has hailed a technological breakthrough for the petrol engine, in an engineering twist for an industry racing to embrace the electric car. Japanese car manufacturer Mazda claims to have designed a vehicle that will largely eliminate the need for spark plugs in petrol engines, increasing fuel efficiency by as much as 30%. The development also increases the existential threat facing diesel engines because its fuel economy could match diesel\u2019s performance without high emissions of nitrogen oxides or sooty particulates. Mazda said it would sell cars from 2019 with a newly developed petrol compression ignition engine, a technology that automotive manufacturers, including deep-pocketed rivals such as Daimler AG and General Motors, have been chasing for decades. The engine ignites petrol through compression, removing the need for spark plugs and increasing fuel efficiency. The announcement places traditional engines at the centre of Mazda\u2019s manufacturing strategy, days after the company \u2013 which sells 1.5m cars a year \u2013 said it will work with larger rival Toyota to develop electric vehicles. \u201cWe think it is an imperative and fundamental job for us to pursue the ideal internal combustion engine,\u201d said Mazda\u2019s head of research and development, Kiyoshi Fujiwara. \u201cElectrification is necessary but ... the internal combustion engine should come first.\u201d But Mazda said its Skyactiv-X engine would have spark plugs that would be used in certain situations such as at low temperatures. \u201cIt\u2019s a major breakthrough,\u201d said Ryoji Miyashita, chairman of automotive engineering company AEMSS. Buthe questioned whether the engine would be smooth and responsive. \u201cIs it jerky? If so, that would pose a big question when it comes to commercialising this technology. Hopefully Mazda has an answer to that question.\u201d Mazda previously said it would work with Toyota to develop electric vehicles and build a $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn) US assembly plant. It added it would introduce electric vehicles and electric technology in its cars from 2019, focusing on markets that restrict the sale of certain vehicles to limit air pollution or that provide clean sources of electricity. In addition, Mazda said it aimed to make autonomous-driving technology standard in all of its models by 2025, a move that many in the industry see linked hand-in-hand with fully battery-powered electric cars. The industry is still steering in the direction of electric vehicles. In the UK, the government has announced it would ban the sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 amid fears that rising levels of nitrogen oxide pose a major risk to public health, putting an end date on the life expectancy of traditional combustion-engine powered vehicles. Volvo recently announced all its new cars would be built with electric or hybrid engines from 2019, while Silicon Valley-based electric car company Tesla recently started delivering its more mass-market aimed car, the $35,000 Model 3, which can travel up to 310 miles between charges with an extended range battery.",

    "webTitle": "Murdoch\u2019s Sky takeover bid delayed as Ofcom is asked for further input", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s proposed takeover of Sky has met with further delays after the government asked the media regulator to conduct further analysis of the mogul and his company\u2019s adherence to broadcasting standards. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport made the intervention after the government and Ofcom faced calls to deepen their investigation into the Murdoch family\u2019s suitability to buy Sky because of allegations that Fox News had colluded with the White House on a story that contained fabricated quotes. The US corporation 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James, wants to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own in an \u00a311.7bn deal. On Tuesday the DCMS said it had received submissions that raise \u201cnew evidence and/or comment\u201d about Ofcom\u2019s assessment of the takeover and was \u201cseeking further clarification\u201d from the regulator. The department has asked Ofcom to respond by 25 August, meaning that the government is almost certain not to announce a final decision on whether to refer the deal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) until parliament returns from summer recess in September. The Murdochs have already expressed concerns about delays to the regulatory process and tried to speed it up by not submitting an improved offer to allay the concerns of the government. An improved offer would have required further behind-the-scenes negotiation. Shares in Sky fell by almost 5p to 963.54p after the DCMS announcement and are now close to their lowest levels since the Murdochs\u2019 takeover bid emerged last December. It is understood that Ofcom has been asked for its comments on a range of broadcasting standards issues, and not that one particular piece of evidence has transformed the government\u2019s view of the deal. The submissions to the DCMS included the threat of legal action from a group of high-profile MPs including the former Labour leader and longtime Murdoch critic Ed Miliband, and Avaaz, the campaign group, if the government did not ask the CMA for a full investigation into the deal on the grounds of broadcasting standards. The MPs and Avaaz have criticised Ofcom for advising the government not to launch a broadcasting standards investigation despite a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News and the phone hacking scandal at the News of the World. On Monday the MPs published a new letter they had sent to Bradley which said that the allegations that Fox News had colluded with the White House on a story that turned out to be false \u2013 which the company denies \u2013 suggested a \u201cbrazen disregard for the ethics of journalism\u201d and showed that new compliance procedures at the company had \u201cfailed dismally\u201d. The MPs said there were grounds to launch a judicial review against Ofcom because the regulator had used an incorrectly high legal threshold when judging whether the deal should face a detailed investigation into broadcasting standards. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, has already said that she was minded to refer the deal to the CMA on the grounds of media plurality, pointing to concerns raised by Ofcom in a report about the proposed takeover. Bradley said last month she had received \u201ctens of thousands of representations\u201d since she announced her initial views at the end of June. But the question of broadcasting standards remains open after her intervention; it had been thought that Bradley would not make a reference on these grounds. A separate report by Ofcom cleared the Murdochs as \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners of Sky and this is not thought to be under scrutiny in the government\u2019s latest intervention because it is a matter for the regulator. In its statement on Tuesday, the DCMS said: \u201cAfter assessing the large number of representations made in relation to the secretary of state\u2019s referral decision, a number of these raise new evidence and/or comment on the Ofcom assessment. Any referral decision by the secretary of state must be taken on the basis of a valid assessment of all the relevant evidence. For this reason the DCMS has asked Ofcom to advise on a number of points arising from these representations.\u201d An Ofcom spokesperson said the regulator had received the DCMS request and would respond before 25 August. Alaphia Zoyab, a senior campaigner at Avaaz, said: \u201cOfcom took a \u2018see no evil, hear no evil\u2019 approach to investigating the Murdochs and their fake news factory Fox News. Under pressure from Avaaz and others, Secretary Bradley is beginning to see just how flawed that approach was. She should push for a deeper probe, and she knows that if she doesn\u2019t, a legal challenge is possible.\u201d",

An improved offer would have required further behind-the-scenes negotiation. Shares in Sky fell by almost 5p to 963.54p after the DCMS announcement and are now close to their lowest levels since the Murdochs\u2019 takeover bid emerged last December.<br></p> <p>It is understood that Ofcom has been asked for its comments on a range of broadcasting standards issues, and not that one particular piece of evidence has transformed the government\u2019s view of the deal.</p> <p>The submissions to the DCMS included the threat of legal action from a group of high-profile MPs including the former Labour leader and longtime Murdoch critic Ed Miliband, and Avaaz, the campaign group, if the government did not ask the CMA for a full investigation into the deal on the grounds of broadcasting standards. The MPs and Avaaz have criticised Ofcom for advising the government not to launch a broadcasting standards investigation despite a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News and the phone hacking scandal at the News of the World.</p> <p>On Monday the MPs published a new letter they had sent to Bradley which said that the allegations that Fox News had colluded with the White House on a story that turned out to be false \u2013 which the company denies \u2013 suggested a \u201cbrazen disregard for the ethics of journalism\u201d and showed that new compliance procedures at the company had \u201cfailed dismally\u201d.</p> <p>The MPs said there were grounds to launch a judicial review against Ofcom because the regulator had used an incorrectly high legal threshold when judging whether the deal should face a detailed investigation into broadcasting standards.</p> <p>Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, has already said that she was minded to refer the deal to the CMA on the grounds of media plurality, pointing to concerns raised by Ofcom in a report about the proposed takeover. Bradley said last month she had received \u201ctens of thousands of representations\u201d since she announced her initial views at the end of June.</p> <p>But the question of broadcasting standards remains open after her intervention; it had been thought that Bradley would not make a reference on these grounds.</p> <p>A separate report by Ofcom cleared the Murdochs as \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners of Sky and this is not thought to be under scrutiny in the government\u2019s latest intervention because it is a matter for the regulator. </p> <p>In its statement on Tuesday, the DCMS said: \u201cAfter assessing the large number of representations made in relation to the secretary of state\u2019s referral decision, a number of these raise new evidence and/or comment on the Ofcom assessment.

      "bodyText": "\u201cChildhood\u201d in \u201cCrisis\u201d, edited by Phil Scraton (Letters, 7 August) and published in 1996, has long been considered the definitive reference book on child poverty and the demonisation of young people by academics and youth and community practitioners alike. However, when first released it could not have been predicted that those warnings about austerity measures and social exclusion would prove prescient in terms of young people\u2019s current status in the UK, including their mental health issues and harm-related behaviours (Bed found for suicidal girl after judge\u2019s fury, 5 August). As a former youth service manager, school governor and manager of a community-based social inclusion project, I have directly observed the impact of those draconian cuts over the past few years, and the decimation of most youth services and young people\u2019s drop-in support provision can be directly linked to the provision of funding for Cameron\u2019s flagship National Citizen Service, leaving thousands of vulnerable young people without year-round support. This government\u2019s drive to privatise public services has enabled profit-driven providers to get rich at the expense of young people in deprived communities. Who could have predicted that, by 2016, so many young people would be dependent on food banks and without hope for their own futures? Highly qualified and experienced staff have been replaced by unqualified staff, often on zero-hours contracts, with the subsequent decline in both quality and quantity of provision. Many young people are now marginalised and isolated within their own communities; increased risk from harm and exploitation of our young people has not happened overnight, and it can be shown to be directly linked to poorly thought through austerity measures. Perhaps Professor Scraton could now predict the post-Brexit outcomes for our young people as EU grants aimed at promoting social inclusion and meaningful employment are withdrawn? Norma Hornby Warrington, Cheshire \u2022 Rather predictably, following James Munby\u2019s \u201cblood on our hands\u201d outburst, the NHS \u201cidentified a bed\u201d for the suicidal 17-year-old, leaving him to claim, probably correctly, that NHS England would not have acted \u201cas effectively or speedily\u201d without his \u201coutspoken warnings\u201d (Judge\u2019s plea as suicidal teenager is found refuge, 8 August). With new crises being highlighted almost daily, the latest being the closure of maternity wards, and pregnant women being \u201cpushed from pillar to post\u201d, Munby\u2019s example should be followed (Maternity wards closed 400 times as shortage of beds and staff grows, 8 August). At a time when the \u201causterity chickens\u201d are coming home to roost, and Labour protests are not always getting the media attention they deserve, he cannot be the only dignitary to be appalled by the current situation. Is it not incumbent upon all judges, archbishops, lords, and even some \u201ccelebrities\u201d, to make their voices heard? If the \u201cbrand\u201d is indeed to be \u201creinvented\u201d, royals also could be doing more than \u201cchampioning mental-health charities\u201d (The royals, a brand reinvented by the millennial generation, 5 August). It is not only our MPs who should be feeling embarrassed by the huge inequality and unfairness that has been allowed to pervade society in the fifth-richest country in the world. Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022 Professor Marmot finds it difficult to link the increases in mortality to changes in government policy (North-south divide\u2019s toll on young adults, 8 August). It might be easier to link those increases to governments\u2019 negligence. They have allowed the single adult jobseeker\u2019s allowance to rot on the vine, from 1979 when it was 21% of average earnings, to 2008 when it had fallen to 10.5% of average earnings. Increases were frozen at 1% in 2011; since 2013, during the rollout of universal credit, it has remained unchanged at \u00a373.10 a week, or \u00a357.90 a week for the under-25s. Then it can be stopped for several months by a zero-hours contract or a benefit sanction. Since 2013 it has had to pay rent and council tax. It is governmental negligence when the poorest young citizens do not have enough money to heat a home or buy a healthy balanced diet. Universities report time and time again that cold homes increase rates of respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, excess winter deaths and mental illness. Inadequate diets increase the risk of malnutrition, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Debt with insufficient income impacts on health indirectly through increased stress, depression and anxiety, and suboptimal coping behaviours \u2013 such as increased rates of smoking and drinking. After the crash in 2008, the Queen asked: \u201cWhy did no one see it coming?\u201d Ten years later, she might well ask the same question about the rise of early deaths among young people. Rev Paul Nicolson Taxpayers Against Poverty \u2022 I hope David Gauke will respond positively to the letter from Laura Pidcock MP and her parliamentary colleagues (7 August). But I hope he will go further, as it\u2019s not enough to pause the rollout of universal credit without also addressing the causes of the six- to seven- week wait for the first UC payment. First, he should abolish the seven-day waiting period before entitlement starts. Even Lord Freud, one of UC\u2019s architects, now accepts it should be dropped. Second, he should look again at the decision to move from a fortnightly to a monthly benefit. This ideologically motivated change was designed to alter behaviour on the grounds that it would prepare claimants better for paid work. Yet the government\u2019s own figures show that many low-paid workers are paid more frequently than that. Not only do monthly payments create the initial problems highlighted in the MPs\u2019 letter, they also create unnecessary difficulties for those \u2013 typically mothers \u2013 who just about get by when budgeting weekly or fortnightly. The seven-day waiting period and monthly benefits policies create avoidable hardship, thereby undermining confidence in UC. A new broom at the Department for Work and Pensions should use the opportunity to think again. Ruth Lister Labour, House of Lords \u2022 Polly Toynbee is right, Sure Start centres provided support and hope for families living in dire poverty and the deprivation that brings to their children (The end of child poverty? Not with the Tories in power, 8 August). I cannot understand how our society allows the ruling class to turn back the clock on those in poverty to the dark days of the TV series Poldark. There are those who can sit cosily watching this programme on Sunday evenings, thinking it historical. Yet there are many Warleggans in the Tory party sitting in parliament right now.

      "bodyText": "The popularity of Ed Sheeran and his latest album, Divide, helped drive a 58% increase in streaming revenue for Warner Music, putting it on track to make more than $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) from digital services including Spotify and Apple Music this year. The world\u2019s third largest record company made $360m from streaming in the three months to the end of June, up 58.6% on the same period a year ago, crediting top-selling artists including Sheeran, Dua Lipa, Bruno Mars, Gorillaz and Clean Bandit. A spokesman said Divide, which smashed streaming records on Spotify when it launched in March, had a \u201cbig bang\u201d effect on sales in the third quarter of its financial year. The company also pointed to Mars\u2019s third album, 24K Magic, which has continued to sell strongly since being released in November, as well as Linkin Park\u2019s final album before the death of their lead singer, Chester Bennington, last month. The boost in streaming revenue was marked even compared with Warner Music\u2019s previous quarter (up 20%), and has put it on track to crack the $1bn annual streaming revenue mark for the first time. Warner Music is on target to make more than $1.3bn from streaming revenues, compared with just over $900m in its last financial year, to the end of September 2016. After a decade of plummeting revenues due to online piracy, the decline in CD sales and a lack of viable streaming services, the music industry\u2019s fortunes are looking up. \u201cAs we see it, the industry is still in the early stages of its recovery. In 2016, the recorded music industry was only half as big as it was in the year 2000,\u201d said Steve Cooper, the chief executive of Warner Music, in a call with investors. \u201cI often get asked whether or not these trends can continue. We at Warner are confident they will. There remains an enormous amount of untapped potential for subscription streaming to achieve global scale.\u201d He added that Warner Music is still in talks on a new licensing deal with Spotify, the last of the majors to do so following Universal Music and Sony. These deals gave Spotify a small reduction on how much it pays in royalties, but allow the labels more flexibility on making albums available only to Spotify users paying for its premium service. \u201cWe only agree to terms that are \u2018net positive\u2019 for our recording artists and songwriters,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cAt the same time, we want to stimulate a healthy and competitive ecosystem. We must work with digital services to create greater differentiation between subscription and ad-supported models.\u201d Warner Music reported that revenues across its recorded and music publishing operations rose 13% year-on-year to $917m for the three months to the end of June, its biggest third quarter in 14 years. Digital revenues across the business grew 30% to $496m, accounting for more than half of the record company\u2019s total income in the quarter. In May, Warner Music renewed its licensing contract with YouTube in tough talks Cooper referred to in an internal memo at the time as not being a \u201cfree market\u201d negotiation. The music industry has accused YouTube, owned by Alphabet, of a \u201cvalue grab\u201d, paying a fraction of the royalties of subscription audio streaming services such as Spotify. YouTube has said that last year it paid more than $1bn globally to the music industry from advertising that runs around videos. Last month, Sheeran\u2019s new album, and his headline Glastonbury spot, were credited with helping increase total UK music sales by 11% in the first half of the year. At one point Sheeran\u2019s album overwhelmed the official charts with all 16 songs making the Top 20 singles list.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Netflix has grand ambitions for Millarworld, the Scottish comic book company it acquired this week. The aim is to repeat Disney\u2019s success with Marvel, where the creator of the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy has become a launchpad for multibillion-dollar film franchises. Here are four ways in which Netflix can make a global success of Millarworld properties, a job made tougher as the deal does not include founder Mark Millar\u2019s best-known properties: Kick-Ass and Kingsman. 1. Create a superhero universe The latest trend in Hollywood is to create a \u201cuniverse\u201d from a group of characters. Disney has the Avengers ensemble, which includes characters such as Captain America, Thor and Iron Man \u2013 who also have their own standalone films. This is not about flogging a concept through a series of sequels but building up a series of characters that can flit across multiple films (and probably TV series in the case of Netflix). Warner Brothers is tapping into this approach by expanding its DC Comics heroes \u2013 Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman \u2013 into a universe under the Justice League banner. Universal is developing its so-called \u201cdark universe\u201d of monster films ranging from The Mummy, the Invisible Man, and Dracula to vampire hunter Van Helsing. Millarworld has so far developed 18 character franchises. Three of these \u2013 Wanted, Kick-Ass and Kingsman \u2013 have so far made the successful jump to the big screen grossing about $1bn (\u00a3770m) at the box office. However, Kingsman and Kick-Ass are licensed to other producers. Netflix releases films in cinemas but its main business is streaming content to subscribers so it referred to TV series and kids\u2019 shows as well as films. Netflix is banking on Millarworld introducing viewers to a new universe of hitherto unknown worlds \u2013 with franchises including Jupiter\u2019s Legacy about a dysfunctional superhero family, a gifted petrol station worker called Huck and Duke McQueen, \u201ca space age hero who may be a little past his prime\u201d \u2013 that will become household names. Like Disney\u2019s Avengers, Millar says the \u201cvast tapestry of characters and superteams\u201d all tie together, which Netflix will convert into a range of TV and film projects for its more than 100m global subscribers. \u201cSome of the Millarworld comics have been made into some big films. There is some latent awareness of its properties,\u201d said Richard Broughton, analyst at media consultancy Ampere. \u201cBut there is a large range of untapped comics yet to translate to TV or big screen. Netflix has a lot of work to do to raise awareness of this alternative intellectual property that are not household names in a way Marvel or DC Comics characters are.\u201d 2. Ensure Millarworld\u2019s output has international appeal Disney had the luxury of building the Marvel hit factory selectively from a world of 5,000 characters, many of whom were not seen worthy of development when the company was acquired for $4bn in 2009. Millarworld is a smaller canvas. Millarworld\u2019s creations are not well known cinematically on the global stage and it is superbrands such as Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and the Avengers that have driven more than $12bn in box office takings alone for Disney. Well-established brand characters are still no guarantee of success. Ryan Reynold\u2019s Green Lantern, made by Warner Bros, and The Fantastic Four, made by 20th Century Fox, both flopped. Even Millar\u2019s biggest hit has struggled to make it to maintain its momentum.Matthew Vaughan, director of the hit adaptation of Kick-Ass, said that the sequel \u201clost a few fans\u201d. 3. Talent retention and character development Mark Millar operates Millarworld as something of a collective of creators but the name above the door is his \u2013 he and his wife, Lucy, jointly own the Glasgow-based company. Netflix chiefs have heaped praise on Millar calling him \u201cas close as you can get to a modern-day Stan Lee\u201d, the Marvel executive and legendary creator of some of the biggest superheroes in print and film including Spiderman, Iron Man, X-Men, Hulk and Thor. Millar has proven he has the Marvel midas touch, after an eight-year stint at the business. While there, he developed the comic books and story arcs that inspired the Avengers film, Captain America: Civil War and the recent Wolverine movie, Logan. Netflix have a guarantee that Millar and his team will continue to develop new stories and character franchises under the Netflix label, even if they won\u2019t relocate to the US anytime soon. The 47-year old, from the town of Coatbridge in north Lanarkshire, said in a recent interview that he visits the US once a year and conducts the rest of his transatlantic business by phone or Skype. 4. Bring in cutting-edge talent to help Millar Disney has proven very canny at identifying creative talent that can give its creations new leases of life. It had scouted Lin-Manuel Miranda, the composer and actor behind Hamilton, before he reached global fame with his musical about the founder of America\u2019s financial system. Miranda has co-written songs for the Disney film Moana and will co-star in the studio\u2019s sequel to Mary Poppins. Disney was also astute in handing over the Avengers universe to writer-director Joss Whedon. If Millar is willing, Netflix can pull off a similar feat with Millarworld given the streaming firm\u2019s willingness to offer artists greater creative leeway, as shown by the success of Stranger Things and its appeal to highly-rated directors like David Mich\u00f4d (War Machine) and Cary Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation).",

Chinese imports and exports both grew slower than expected, at 11% and 7.2% respectively in July. Economists say it could be a sign that domestic demand is dipping. Germany also missed forecasts, with a 4.5% tumble in imports and a 2,8% drop in exports. However, this may be a blip after a good run of German data this year. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, has a good take: A notable slowdown from China is an indicator that something is amiss. For China, this is particularly concerning as it is engaging on a serious path towards emerging as the next global power house.... [On Germany]....As economists had expected exports to dip by 0.3% and imports to rise by 0.2%, the below par performance will once again ignite criticism that Germany is destabilising the global economy (and contributing to the EU\u2019s woes) by running such a large trade surplus. The data have investors little to get excited about, with the FTSE 100 now down 9 points and other markets similarly subdued. But MSCI\u2019s gauge of global markets has hit a new record high, thanks to the long rally in US stocks. The pound remains vulnerably to Brexit concerns, sliding to a new 10-month low against the euro. I\u2019ll be back if there are any major developments.... Over in Athens the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is mulling a full-scale government reshuffle over the summer, reports our correspondent Helena Smith Before departing on what close aides are describing as a \u201cshort one-week\u201d holiday this weekend, Tsipras is weighing up pushing ahead with a major cabinet reshuffle in the coming days. The makeover, well-placed sources say, depends almost entirely on the role the British-trained Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, will play in the next government. The Oxford-educated economist is liked by his interlocutors not least officials representing the international bodies keeping debt-stricken Greece afloat but is believed to want to want to move on after overseeing some of the most difficult bailout talks to date. The reshuffle is aimed squarely at boosting the leftist-led coalition\u2019s flagging popularity ahead of the new economic year which traditionally starts when the prime minister opens the International Trade Fair in Thessaloniki in early September. Encouragingly for Tsipras, yields (or interest rates) on Greek two and ten-year bonds have dropped precipitously since negotiations were wrapped up. Investors are now looking to the autumn to see what decisions are made regarding mid-term debt relief that would make the country\u2019s economic recovery sustainable. The global economy is still on a steady growth path, according to the latest heathcheck from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD has rounded up the latest economic data (Composite leading indicators, or CLIs), and concluded that there is \u201cstable growth momentum\u201d across the 35 advanced countries that make up the OECD area as a whole. However, it has also spotted thatBritain\u2019s economy is slowing (having only grown by 0.5% this year). The OECD says: The CLIs continue to point to stable growth momentum in Japan, Canada and the euro area as a whole. Stable growth momentum is now also expected in theUnited States and Italy,while in the United Kingdom the CLI confirms the tentative signs of easing growth flagged in last month\u2019s assessment. Prospects of growth gaining momentum remain unchanged for Germany and France, as well as for China and Brazil. Amongst other major emerging economies, the CLIs continue to anticipate stable growth momentumin India while in Russia tentative signs of easing growth remain. Sterling has slipped to its lowest level against the euro last October. The pound dipped by 0.14% to \u20ac1.1032 in quiet trading, meaning one euro is now worth 90.63p. The euro has strengthened steadily in recent months, helped by signs that the eurozone economy is enjoying a good year. The pound, though, remains dogged by Brexit worries - and fears that Britain and Brussels will fall out over the size of the UK\u2019s \u2018exit bill\u2019. Overnight, Sir Simon Fraser, a former head of the Foreign Office, has claimed that the UK has been \u201ca bit absent\u201d in the early negotiations. London insiders deny that they\u2019re slacking; we\u2019ll find out the truth soon, when the UK releases its position papers on a series of vital issues, including the Irish border and access to the single market. Here\u2019s a neat chart showing the slowdown in Chinese trade growth last month. Joshua Mahony of IG adds: The morning has been all about trade data, with the two powerhouses of Asia and Europe going head to head, to equally disappointing effect. On the face of it, both German and Chinese trade improved, with their balance of trade improving further. However, this comes as a result of a disproportionately larger fall in imports than the drop in exports. Certainly a fall in imports and exports across two of the biggest industrial nations in the world is not a particularly bullish sign, yet according to yesterday\u2019s latest World Trade Outlook Indicator, the WTO suggests that global merchandise trade growth will continue to strengthen in the Q3. Investors seem to be taking today\u2019s Chinese trade figures in their stride.... Newsflash: World stock markets have hit their highest ever levels, following last night\u2019s rally on Wall Street. The MSCI All-Country World Stocks Index has nudged up to 480.76 points, Reuters reports, helped by Dow Jones\u2019s run of nine record highs in a row (and counting...) Bookmaker Paddy Power is having another rough morning. Shares have fallen 5% to their lowest level in two years, after the company revealed it might take a year to get its new CEO in place. Paddy Power announced yesterday that chief executive Breon Corcoran was stepping down, to be replaced by Peter Jackson, CEO of the UK arm of globalpayments business WorldPay Group. There\u2019s just one problem, Jackson has his hands full handling WorldPay\u2019s takeover by US rival Vantiv, so it\u2019s not clear when he can jump ship. Corcoran told Reuters that: \u201cThey recognise we both have 12 months notice periods and they\u2019re in the middle of the deal. Peter\u2019s coming here, we all hope it will be sooner but equally it will be within six to 12 months.\u201d The prospect of a 12-month hiatus hasn\u2019t pleased the City, especially as Corcoran says the company faces a \u201cdynamic and highly competitive market\u201d following its merger with Betfair. Lee Wild, Interactive Investor\u2019s Head of Equity Strategy, says Jackson has a fight on his hands, especially as the government is reviewing the whole gambling sector. \u201cPicking Peter Jackson as CEO is a brave move when you\u2019re losing someone of Breon Corcoran\u2019s pedigree. He\u2019s only held the hot seat at FTSE 100-listed Worldpay\u2019s UK division since March, and Paddy Power Betfair needs strong leadership now more than ever. With wider industry issues at play here, the market is yet to be convinced it\u2019s the right move. The company has struggled, losing up to a third of its value since the Irish bookmaker merged with the online gambling site 18 months ago..... Revenue growth of 9% and 21% increase in underlying profit was largely in line with expectations, but there are wider problems for Paddy Power Betfair and the sector. Translation: It\u2019s quiet out there in the markets.... European stock markets are subdued this morning, as this morning\u2019s trade figures fail to cheer traders. In London the FTSE 100 dipped by 3 points or 0.04%. Yesterday Britain\u2019s blue-chip index hit a seven-week high, but this morning is is being pulled down by mining stocks (following the Chinese import and export slowdown). It\u2019s a double-dose of disappointing trade data. Germany has reported that exports shrank by 2.8% during June. That\u2019s the biggest monthly drop since August 2015, and ends a five-month run of growth. In another blow, German imports shrank by 4.5% during the month - the biggest drop since January 2009 when the world economy was sliding into recession. Economists had expected exports to dip by 0.3%, and imports to rise by 0.2%. This has driven Germany\u2019s trade surplus up to \u20ac21.1bn, from \u20ac20.3b in May, a 10-month high. That may intensify criticism that Germany is destabilising the global economy by running such a large trade surplus. The slowdown in Chinese trade growth last month has not pleased the City. Capital Economics fear that China\u2019s economy could be cooling: \u201cDespite an uptick at the end of the second quarter, trade growth now appears to be on a downward trend. In particular, the sharp decline in import growth since the start of the year suggests that domestic demand is softening,\u201d Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the figures may show the global economy losing some momentum: This morning\u2019s Chinese trade data for July has got Q3 off to a slow start with imports only rising 11% a sharp fall from June\u2019s 17.2%, which raises some concerns that domestic demand may be softening. Exports were also a bit of a worry as they only rose 7.2%, below expectations of 11% and a fall from June\u2019s 11.3%. This would appear to suggest that while global demand is still positive it may well not be as strong as initially thought, which might be a concern further down the line if it suggests a start of a trend. David Scutt of Business Insider points out that imports of key commodities slowed in July: Crude oil imports stood at 34.66 million tonnes, down from 36.11 million tonnes a month earlier, while imports of iron ore slipped to 85.74 million tonnes from 94.7 million tonnes in June. Coal imports also dipped to 19.46 million tonnes, a four-month low. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors won\u2019t be happy to see Chinese export growth slowing: The numbers have painted a dull picture to start the third quarter of this year. It is important that global demand improves because that would imply that the world economy is healthy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The global economy is in the spotlight today, as investors digest new trade figures from China and Germany. And China has disappointed the markets, by reporting that imports and exports both missed expectations in July. Chinese exports only grew by 7.2% per year last month (in US dollar terms), down from 11.5% in June, and below expectations of an 10.9% rise. That\u2019s the weakest growth since February, when Chinese industry was disrupted by the Lunar New Year festivities. Imports have also underwhelmed, rising by 11%. That sounds like a good performance, until you note that it\u2019s down from 17.2% in June, and the weakest growth since December. Economists had expected growth of around 16.6%. This drove the Chinese trade surplus up to $46.74bn, the highest since January. This may show that global demand is cooling; just at the moment when central bankers in several advanced economies are pondering whether to tighten monetary policy and unwind their stimulus packages. The figures are just as discouraging if you price them in yuan, rather than US dollars, as economist Daniel Lacalle tweets: Otherwise, the day looks a little quiet with not much in the diary. There could be excitement on Wall Street, though, where the Dow has hit nine record highs in a row. Can it manage a 10th? There\u2019s not much hope of drama in Europe\u2019s markets, though; the main indices are all expected to dip a little. I guess the August lull may have arrived.....",

      "bodyText": "Paddy Power Betfair has said the lack of a major football tournament and unfavourable sports results were to blame for a slowdown in growth in the first half of the year. Shares in the betting group fell sharply for a second day, after the bookmaker surprised investors on Monday with the revelation that Breon Corcoran had resigned as chief executive. The company was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday, down 5%, after it revealed revenue growth over the first six months had fallen to 9% from 18% in the same period a year earlier. First-half revenue of \u00a3827m included a \u00a340m boost from the weakness of the pound since the Brexit vote, which flattered overseas sales. The slowdown in growth reflected a weak second quarter, with revenues down 2%, was partly due to a tough comparable period, with the bookmaker cashing in last year from Euro 2016. The company said it also lost out as customers backed winning favourites in April and May in the Premier League and Champions League football, and at events such as the Grand National and the US Masters. In the first quarter, revenue rose by 23% as the company benefited from more favourable sports results, particularly at Cheltenham Festival. Underlying earnings in the first half overall increased by 21% to \u00a3220m. Corcoran said the company was investing to improve its position in a \u201chighly competitive market\u201d, spending more on promotional offers and slashing odds for customers. \u201cOur customers and shareholders are already seeing benefits from efficiencies and investments. In the first half alone, customers enjoyed approximately \u00a330m of extra value through better odds, more generous offers and new loyalty benefits,\u201d he said. Paddy Power Betfair said on Monday that Corcoran would be replaced by Peter Jackson, a non-executive director at the gambling firm and chief executive of the UK business of Worldpay, which handles 40% of all card payments at tills in Britain. The company said Jackson\u2019s start date would be confirmed \u201cin due course\u201d. \u201cBreon [Corcoran] will continue to lead the group in the meantime, completing the integration of the Paddy Power and Betfair businesses, and ensuring the delivery of an orderly transition,\u201d the company said. Corcoran was instrumental in the \u00a35bn merger of Paddy Power and Betfair in 2015, which created one of the world\u2019s largest online gambling businesses.",
