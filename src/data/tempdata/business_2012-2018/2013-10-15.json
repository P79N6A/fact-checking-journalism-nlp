      "bodyText": "The fast-food industry's business model of low wages and low employee benefits is costing American taxpayers billions of dollars a year in public assistance programmes, according to two reports published on Tuesday. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Illinois found that 52% of US fast food workers earn so little they are forced to rely on at least one type of public assistance programme. They described as \"staggering\" the extent to which such public programmes effectively subsidise the fast-food industry's reliance on low-paid workers. Compared to the average American worker, \"non-managerial\" fast food employees like cooks, servers and cashiers are twice as likely to need public assistance, the researchers found. Overall, according to the study, an average of $7bn of taxpayer money was spent on assistance for fast-food workers each year between 2007 and 2011. A companion report, by the National Employment Law Project, said that an estimated $3.8bn is spent each year on workers at America's 10 largest fast-food companies, and that McDonald's alone accounts for $1.2bn of that. Jack Temple, a public policy analyst at NELP, said the fast-food industry model of low wages, non-existent benefits and limited working hours for front-line workers costs more than it appears to, because taxpayers are picking up the big chains' slack. \"It doesn't matter whether you work or shop at McDonald's or not, the low-wage business model is expensive for everybody,\" Temple said. \"Companies \u2026 are basically pushing off part of their costs on the taxpayers.\" Ken Jacobs, the chairman of the UC Berkeley Labor Center and author of one of the reports, said he and his colleagues found that only 13% of fast-food workers \u2013 who earn an overall median wage of $8.69 an hour \u2013 receive benefits like health insurance from their employers. The need for public assistance programmes is \"the rule rather than the exception\", Jacobs said, even for those working more than 40 hours per week. The estimated total cost of $7bn annually is likely to be low, researchers said, because they only looked at four types of public assistance: food stamps; healthcare; the Earned Income Tax Credit and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the program typically best known as \"welfare.\" They did not include subsidised housing, school lunches, home heating assistance or state programs in their analysis. \"The high participation rate of families of core fast-food workers in public programs can be attributed to three major factors: the industry's low wages, low work hours and low benefits,\" the Berkeley report said. The studies come in the wake of strikes and walkouts organized by fast-food employees in 60 US towns and cities in the summer, part of a small but growing movement among service and retail workers to call for higher wages and the ability to unionize without harassment by employers. Earlier this year, a report by House Democrats estimated that the cost of Walmart workers' reliance on public assistance \u2013 including food stamps, healthcare and other programmes \u2013 is $900,000 per year at just one of the company's 4,000 stores. A spokesman for McDonald's said: \"Our history is full of examples of individuals who worked their first job with McDonald's and went on to successful careers both within and outside of McDonald's. \"As with most small businesses, wages are based on local wage laws and are competitive to similar jobs in that market.

    "webTitle": "Angela Ahrendts leaves Burberry for new job at Apple", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Angela Ahrendts, the chief executive who led British brand Burberry's transformation into a sexy modern fashion label, is swapping trenchcoats for a rather different range of macs. Ahrendts, who was the highest-paid chief executive in the FTSE 100 last year with a pay package of almost \u00a317m, has been poached by Apple, the world's most valuable company. She is expected to double her income when she becomes the boss of the iPad maker's global retail division next summer. Half a billion pounds was wiped off Burberry's stockmarket value as her departure, and the appointment of Burberry's designer Christopher Bailey as her replacement, was announced. Yorkshire-born Bailey and Ahrendts, a US fashion executive from Indiana, have worked closely together since her arrival in 2006, with the designer contributing ideas to many aspects of the business. The Royal College of Art graduate is credited with the social media strategy under which Burberry became the first big fashion house to stream catwalk shows live on the internet, but it is almost unknown for a design specialist to lead a company of Burberry's size. Ahrendts is moving to a demanding job as Apple's status as the world's most profitable computer and smartphone maker is under pressure from rivals such as Samsung. But earlier this week Apple was named the world's most valuable brand, toppling Coca-Cola, and the stores she will oversee have higher sales per square foot than any other retailer in the world. The last person to run Apple's retail empire was also hired from the UK. Former Dixons boss John Browett, was lured to the group's head office in Cupertino, California and handed a \"golden hello\" reported to be worth $56m (\u00a335m). However, Browett never collected the full cash pile as he was fired after less than six months in the role in October last year. Ahrendts will be well cushioned from any such risk in her new job by a stockpile of cash and shares gathered at Burberry. She currently owns shares worth \u00a36.2m and will receive another tranche worth \u00a37.34m next month. Meanwhile, Ahrendts is working beyond her six-month notice period, which would end in April, enabling her to collect a bonus worth up to double her \u00a31.1m salary as well as shares worth \u00a36m due to be handed over in June. Including her basic pay that will take her total pay-out over the next six months to nearly \u00a316m. Ahrendts said: \"I'm proud of everything we've built, and the management team we have in place around the world and infrastructure we have put in place will provide a rock solid foundation for all [Bailey's] innovation.\" Bailey said: \"We've done a lot of dreaming and made those dreams into solid strategies and built an incredible operational and management team to be able to meet those strategies.\" Burberry shares slumped nearly 8% as investors worried that Bailey would struggle to run a \u00a37bn company as well as heading the design operation. There were suggestions that Bailey had been handed the top job to stop him following Ahrendts out of the door. Burberry insisted Bailey's appointment was the result of a long-term succession plan, but analysts and investors were sceptical. Rahul Sharma, a luxury goods analyst at Neev Capital said Burberry had little choice but to choose Bailey as Ahrendts most likely successor after former finance director Stacey Cartwright left earlier this year. \"I think Angela's move was a surprise to them. I would question whether they had any plan in place,\" she said. While Ahrendts said Bailey, the Royal College of Art graduate who has been Burberry's creative visionary for 12 years, would be backed by \"the industry's most powerful management team,\" all the leading players are new. Finance director Carol Fairweather only stepped into the role in July this year while chief operating officer John Smith joined in March. While the company reported strong sales figures on Tuesday, it is still struggling to absorb the fragrance and beauty business it brought in house this spring and next year must tackle the handover of its key Japanese business from a long-term franchise partner. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive of Apple, said he was thrilled that Ahrendts would be joining his team. \"She has shown herself to be an extraordinary leader throughout her career and has a proven track record,\" he said. Cook is banking on Ahrendts' experience building a global network of stores to build Apple's position as a global luxury brand, particularly in China where Burberry has grown rapidly while the tech company has struggled. Apple's store portfolio remains relatively small and in some areas is straining to cope with the demands of millions of new iPad and iPhone owners.Cook is clearly keen to build Apple's style credentials. Ahrendts joins Paul Deneve, the former chief executive officer of Yves St Laurent, who was recently hired by the iPhone maker to work on special projects. The departure of Ahrendts will deplete the already-slim ranks of female chief executives at the UK's biggest companies. Her return to the US means there will be just two women running FTSE 100 businesses \u2013 Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of Easyjet.",

The Royal College of Art graduate is credited with the social media strategy under which Burberry became the first big fashion house to stream catwalk shows live on the internet, but it is almost unknown for a design specialist to lead a company of Burberry's size.</p> <p>Ahrendts is moving to a demanding job as Apple's status as the world's most profitable computer and smartphone maker is under pressure from rivals such as Samsung. But earlier this week Apple was named the world's most valuable brand, toppling Coca-Cola, and the stores she will oversee have higher sales per square foot than any other retailer in the world.</p> <p>The last person to run Apple's retail empire was also hired from the UK. Former Dixons boss John Browett, was lured to the group's head office in Cupertino, California and handed a \"golden hello\" reported to be worth $56m (\u00a335m). However, Browett never collected the full cash pile as he was fired after less than six months in the role in October last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-420105261\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381857371581/Burberry-share-price-001.jpg\" alt=\"Burberry share price\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burberry\u2019s share price before and after Angela Ahrendts resigned. Photograph: theguardian.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ahrendts will be well cushioned from any such risk in her new job by a stockpile of cash and shares gathered at Burberry. She currently owns shares worth \u00a36.2m and will receive another tranche worth \u00a37.34m next month. Meanwhile, Ahrendts is working beyond her six-month notice period, which would end in April, enabling her to collect a bonus worth up to double her \u00a31.1m salary as well as shares worth \u00a36m due to be handed over in June. Including her basic pay that will take her total pay-out over the next six months to nearly \u00a316m.</p> <p>Ahrendts said: \"I'm proud of everything we've built, and the management team we have in place around the world and infrastructure we have put in place will provide a rock solid foundation for all [Bailey's] innovation.\"</p> <p>Bailey said: \"We've done a lot of dreaming and made those dreams into solid strategies and built an incredible operational and management team to be able to meet those strategies.\"</p> <p>Burberry shares slumped nearly 8% as investors worried that Bailey would struggle to run a \u00a37bn company as well as heading the design operation. There were suggestions that Bailey had been handed the top job to stop him following Ahrendts out of the door.</p> <p>Burberry insisted Bailey's appointment was the result of a long-term succession plan, but analysts and investors were sceptical. Rahul Sharma, a luxury goods analyst at Neev Capital said Burberry had little choice but to choose Bailey as Ahrendts most likely successor after former finance director Stacey Cartwright left earlier this year. \"I think Angela's move was a surprise to them. I would question whether they had any plan in place,\" she said.</p> <p>While Ahrendts said Bailey, the Royal College of Art graduate who has been Burberry's creative visionary for 12 years, would be backed by \"the industry's most powerful management team,\" all the leading players are new. Finance director Carol Fairweather only stepped into the role in July this year while chief operating officer John Smith joined in March. While the company reported strong sales figures on Tuesday, it is still struggling to absorb the fragrance and beauty business it brought in house this spring and next year must tackle the handover of its key Japanese business from a long-term franchise partner.</p> <p>Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive of Apple, said he was thrilled that Ahrendts would be joining his team. \"She has shown herself to be an extraordinary leader throughout her career and has a proven track record,\" he said.</p> <p>Cook is banking on Ahrendts' experience building a global network of stores to build Apple's position as a global luxury brand, particularly in China where Burberry has grown rapidly while the tech company has struggled. Apple's store portfolio remains relatively small and in some areas is straining to cope with the demands of millions of new iPad and iPhone owners.Cook is clearly keen to build Apple's style credentials. Ahrendts joins Paul Deneve, the former chief executive officer of Yves St Laurent, who was recently hired by the iPhone maker to work on special projects.</p> <p>The departure of Ahrendts will deplete the already-slim ranks of female chief executives at the UK's biggest companies. Her return to the US means there will be just two women running FTSE 100 businesses \u2013 Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of Easyjet.</p>",

Sants began the high-profile job of running the bank's compliance operations at the beginning of the year after quitting the Financial Services Authority in 2012, before it was disbanded. If he had stayed at the coalition's new-look regulatory bodies, he would have become a deputy governor of the Bank of England and head of the new Prudential Regulation Authority.

Sants, who began his career in banking, found himself at the centre of the financial storm in 2007 after he was promoted to chief executive of the FSA in July, just as the financial crisis struck. The intense workload during the crisis is thought to have taken its toll as Sants took control of Barclay's fast-growing compliance department of 1,300 staff and began to overhaul its culture. Antony Jenkins, the chief executive charged with turning round the reputation of Barclays in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal, has made Sants part of his inner management team, giving him a seat on the executive committee which runs the bank day to day. A Barclays spokesman said: \"Rather than carry on working and risk more serious consequences to his health, he is following medical advice and will be taking a leave of absence until the end of the year.\" Sants is the latest senior City figure to go absent on the recommendation of doctors.

      "bodyText": "PS: one last line from Dublin, from Henry McDonald: There was some pre-Hallowe'en ghoulish reaction to one aspect of the budget cuts from Fianna Fail, the main opposition party in Ireland. The party's finance spokesman Michael McGrath warned that \"even the dead aren't safe from this Government.\" McGrath was referring to the measure in the budget which removes the \u20ac850 burial grant for some pensioners. Amid the confusion in Washington, European stock markets ended higher. Traders still think there's going to be a deal - despite the disfunctionality in Congress. The FTSE 100 finished 41 points higher at 6,549, up 0.64%, led by mining giant Rio Tinto (with Burberry bringing up the rear, down 7.6% following CEO Angela Ahrendts' exit to join Apple). Elsewhere on the stock market, Royal Mail shares finished 14p higher at 489p, a 48% jump on the float price. The German Dax closed at a new record high, up 0.9%, while the French CAC closed at its highest level since 2008. And that's a good time to stop. Live coverage of the Irish budget starts here There's analysis of Michael Noonan's statement here (from Henry)...and an explanation of how pensioners and the young unemployed will be hit hard. There's a list of key points here. Stay tuned to our US liveblog for developments in Washington. Could there be a deal by morning?..... We'll find out by tomorrow. Until then, thanks, and goodnight. GW Twists and turns in Washington this afternoon, with House Republicans proposing their own solution to the debt ceiling/budget deadlock, only to see it slapped down as a \"partisan attempt to appease\" the Tea Party by the White House. In the last few minutes, Senate majority leaders Harry Reid just declared that the House's proposal won't get through the Senate. Clearly a deal isn't agreed -- we'll be tracking it all through the day (and night?) here: House Republicans challenge bipartisan Senate deal to avert default \u2013 live Henry also points out that finance minister Michael Noonan hasn't bowed to pressure from Germany over Ireland's corporation tax rate: In defiance of criticism from the German SPD, Noonan told the Dail there would be no change in Ireland's relatively low corporation tax rate. \"The tax rate is settled policy. We are 100% committed to the 12.5% corporation tax rate. This will not change,\" he said. The SPD in coalition talks with Angela Merkel has demanded the next German government led by her must ask the EU to review the Republic's corporation tax rate. The Social Democrats have argued that the low rate puts Ireland at an advantage over other EU states in terms of attracting foreign direct investment. There was one significant change, though. As I flagged up at 2.55pm, Noonan did promise to stop companies registered in Ireland from being 'stateless' for tax purposes. Dublin correspondent Henry McDonald flags up that this year's budget is a blow to Irish pensioners: One in ten of all pensioners over 70 will lose their full medical card entitling them to free health care. A subsidy of \u20ac114 per year to pay pensioners' telephone bills will also be scrapped while a death grant to pay for funerals - worth \u20ac850 - will be abolished. The move on pensioners could be a major political gamble given that they are one sector of the population guaranteed to get out and vote in elections. The Finance Minister also risked alienating pensioners, who make up a large proportion of savers, over his decision to increase tax on interest gained from savings - the so called DIRT tax rate \u2013 which is to be raised to 41%. Those unemployed under the age of 25 would also bear the brunt of the cuts with jobseeker's allowance being slashed from the current \u20ac144 per week to \u20ac100. The age of eligibility for the full social payment of \u20ac188 (still one of the most generous in the whole of the EU) will be raised to the age of 26. Some reaction to the changes in Irish budget from Twitter: On RTE, Brendan Keenan of the Irish Independent explained that increasing the duty on beer (10c), cigarettes (10c) and wine (50c); and the \u20ac150m/year bank levy, will provide a decent chunk of the revenue increases for 2014. On the savings side, it includes a \u20ac700m cut in the cost of paying public sector workers, Keenan flagged up, following layoffs since the crisis began. The cut to maternity pay is also proving unpopular. The Irish Independent has rounded up all the key tax and spending changes in today's Budget, along with measures that weren't touched: SOCIAL WELFARE Bereavement grant of \u20ac850 to families of dead people scrapped OAP telephone allowance of \u20ac9.50 a month scrapped Reduced dole payment for unemployed people under 26 Maternity benefit higher rate to be cut from \u20ac262 to 230 a week Phasing out of mortgage interest supplement for new applicants Technical changes to the invalidity pension Clawback from insurance companies on compensation payments Rent Supplement minimum contribution to be increased Child benefit for third and subsequent child down \u20ac10, as announced Mortgage Interest Relief to be phased out RTE subsidy for OAP TV licences to be reduced by \u20ac5m from \u20ac59m to \u20ac54m Normal dole payment safe Pension safe Free Travel safe Half rate carers allowance safe Respite Care grant safe HEALTH 35,000 over 70s to go from medical card to GP only card Income thresholds on medical cards for over 70s also to be tightened GP only medical card for all children under 5 Prescription charges to go up by \u20ac1 Cuts to hospital services DUTY CHANGES Wine to go up by 50c Pint, spirits and cigarettes to go up by 10c Cigarette sellers charge to go up 10 fold No excise duty on petrol and diesel expected EDUCATION Ending double payments in training schemes, where participants get two benefits College registration fees to go up by \u20ac250, as announced Pupil-Teacher-Ratio safe Private schools subsidy safe As rumoured, Brendan Howlin has announced that the Irish government will offer free GP care for all under 5s in Ireland. In another bright spot, Howlin also promised 1,250 new teachers. But these were rare spots as the minister for public affairs and reform outlined wider spending cuts to keep Ireland on track to exit its bailout. This included cuts to the unemployment benefit, and for those on maternity leave. Economist Megan Greene isn't convinced that Ireland can hit 2% GDP growth in 2014, as Michael Noonan predicted: Full details of the Irish budget are online here. Our Irish correspondent, Henry McDonald, sums up the key points from the Irish Budget. Michael Noonan has imposed ten cents extra on the price of a packet of cigarettes and the same figure of excise duty on pints of beer and cider. He has also decided to add an extra 50 cents on a bottle of wine. Noonan justified the hikes in alcohol duty with a mind to complaints from Ireland's pub, cafe and restaraunt owners by pointing out that he has frozen the 9% VAT rate in the overall hospitality sector. He stressed there would be no increase in direct taxation and no rise in the Universal Social Charge imposed during the fiscal crisis. Tax on interest gained from savings - the so called DIRT tax rate - would be increased to 41%, Noonan said. To signal the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition is prepared to impose some pain on the hated banking sector bailed out with billions of euro, Noonan said the banks would pay an annual levy of \u20ac150 to the exchequer per annum up to 2016. There was good news for Ireland's tourist sector and businesses experiencing growth this year such as Dublin Airport. The Finance Minister said the \u20ac3 euro tax on every flight would end in April \u201cin the hope that airlines will open more routes into the country\u201d. In a statement of defiance in the face of criticism from the German SPD, the Irish Finance Minister told the Dail there would be no change in Ireland's relatively low corporation tax rate. \"The tax rate is settled policy. We are 100% committed to the 12.5% corporation tax rate. This will not change,\" he assured the parliament. The SPD in coalition talks with Angela Merkel in Berlin has demanded the next future German government led by her must ask the EU to review the Republic's corporation tax rate. The Social Democrats have argued that the low rate puts Ireland at an advantage over other EU states in terms of attracting foreign direct investment. Expect a battle between Dublin and Berlin ahead if the SPD gets its way and corporation tax is on the EU agenda. \"The recovery is underway but there are still risks,\" Noonnan announced to the Dail in his final contribution. \"We are well along the recovery path. Back in Dublin, Labour's Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin, is explaining the expenditure changes in the 2014 Irish budget. It will include \u20ac1.6bn of spending cuts, he says (out of the \u20ac2.5bn total of austerity measures) He defends the deep cutbacks and tax rises of the last few years, saying there was no choice. And he also points out that the Irish budget has come under strain since the crisis began, citing the 200,000 increase in those seeking jobseekers benefits. Breaking away from Dublin... over in Washington, there are signs that Republicans in the House of Representatives are rebelling against plans for a breakthrough deal on the debt ceiling and a new budget . My US colleagues are liveblogging it here: House Republicans challenge bipartisan Senate deal to avert default \u2013 live We are well along the path to recovery, Noonan concludes, and this budget will help us finish the job. Noonan returns to the predicted primary surplus for 2014, saying it will help give the financial markets confidence in lending to Ireland. If a state cannot borrow at affordable rates, it cannot pay for public services, says Noonan. That's one of the key messages from the financial crisis. No tax increase on fuel or heating oil though. The Irish government is also imposing a levy on its banking sector, to raise \u20ac150m per year between 2014 and 2016. Noonan has raised alcohol and tobacco duties, putting 10 cents on a packet of 20 cigarettes, 10 cents on a pint of beer, and 50 cents on a bottle of wine. On growth, the Irish government expects growth of just 0.2% this year, rising to 2% in 2014. Onto the fiscal targets. Noonan said that the Irish deficit would be 7.3% this year, falling to 4.8% in 2014, and 2.9% in 2015. We have beaten our deficit targets to date, and a 4.8% deficit next year will also beat our targets, the finance minister explains. On Corporation Tax, Michael Noonan says the Irish government is committed to its 12.5% corporation tax. He acknowledged the international concern that multinationals are using Ireland to lower their tax bills, and said he would bring in changes to the finance mill to stop Irish companies being 'stateless'. Ireland want to be part of the solution to this global tax challenges, not part of the problem, Noonan said. but.... I want Ireland to play fair, and play to win Noonan also said the government will take steps to increase the housing stock in Ireland, to prevent a new housing bubble emerging. Michael Noonan wins approving noises by announcing he will extend the 9% special relief VAT rate for the hospitality sector -- the subject of a campaign. He is also cutting the air travel tax to zero - adding that he hopes Irish airlines will take advantage of this. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: There is a security cordon with two separate crush barriers manned by Gardai including officers on horseback leading up the Dail this afternoon. Wedged up against the barrier nearer to the parliament is only small eclectic banding of anti-austerity demonstrators ranging from Sinn Fein to a small band of far left groups. Molesworth Street which includes the main Irish passport office is eerily quiet ahead of the budget which is now being delivered. Is it just a coincidence that in the same street the European Commission office on Dublin also has a brand new silver crush barrier around the front of its headquarters? Noonan says his budget will include 25 'pro-jobs' measures. Noonan says some people would like to see more austerity this year, but says this is not acceptable -- quoting WB Yeats: Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart. The Irish government will achieve a deficit of 4.8% in 2014, and a small primary surplus (discounting the cost of servicing Ireland's debts). Noonan confirms that the budget will include \u20ac2.5bn of tax rises and spending cuts. Noonan adds that the Irish economy is now on the road to recovery -- saying 300 new jobs are now being created. Finance minister Michael Noonan is starting to deliver the Irish budget now, blaming reckless polities from the previous government for causing the 'disaster' in Ireland. Here's the scene in the Irish parliament. Nearly time for Ireland's government to announce its budget for 2014. You can watch it live on RTE's website Heads-up: one of the City's best fund managers is stepping down next year to launch a new fund management firm. Neil Woodford, UK head of equities at Invesco Perpetual and one of the premier managers in the Square Mile, will leave in April. He said: I leave the company on good terms and remain fully committed to my fund management responsibilities at Invesco Perpetual until my departure. Walmart's chief executive, Mike Duke, says America's shoppers are also fretting about the US shutdown. fastfT has the quote from Duke, who was speaking at Walmart's annual meeting with USA analysts: It should come as no surprise that the government shutdown is on the mind of our US customers. as you would expect that we're following this situation very closely. Here's our take on the latest City investigation, into whether foreign exchange rates may have been secretly manipulated: Former Royal Bank of Scotland trader linked to currency market fixing Annalisa Piazza of Newedge Strategy says today's drop on the Empire State Factory index shows that US firms are worrying about the federal government shutdown. She writes: Concerns about the current fiscal negotiations and shutdown of the federal government offices (and possible effects on the real economy) clearly explain the decline in sentiment over the month. That said, the survey remains consistent with the idea of moderate growth in the district, without signs of robust acceleration in activity in the near term.... All in all, a decline in confidence is perfectly justified by the current uncertain fiscal scenario. Risks (albeit low) of a default of the US debt are partially incorporated in the current sentiment survey and we expect a technical correction to materialise once a final (or temporary) deal is found in Washington DC. Here's a rarity -- some economic data out of America. And it doesn't look too impressive. The New York Fed's Empire State Factory index, which monitors manufacturing conditions in the area, dropped to just +1.5 from +6.3 in September. That's means conditions improved, but at the lowest rate since May this year. Analysts expected a rise to +7. The drop was partly caused by deteriorating employment conditions (the employment sub-index slipped from 7.5 to 3.6). However, the new-orders measure picked up. \"Hard to tell what this index is telling us,\" says Bloomberg 's economics editor Michael McKee as the news flashed up. He quickly homed in on a line that firms aren't seeking new credit because they can't see the demand. Not a great sign, with the US shutdown now eating into economic activity. Short-term US debt is rising in value in early New York trading, pushing down the interest rate on America's bonds. 15-Oct-2013 13:16 - U.S. TREASURY BILL RATES FALL ON SIGNS OF POSSIBLE U.S. FISCAL DEAL 15-Oct-2013 13:19 - INTEREST RATES ON U.S. T-BILL ISSUES DUE IN OCTOBER TO NOVEMBER FALL LOWEST IN A WEEK The yield on one-month US Treasury bills is down around 5 basis points at 0.2%. They mature around the time that America could default if it cannot reach a debt ceiling deal. RTE's Tony Connelly has full details of Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble's comments on the Irish banking sector: Seeing some reports from the Euro press pack that Germany's finance minister has dampened hopes that Irish banks could be retroactively recapitalised through Europe's new Stability Mechanism. The back story here is that Dublin 'took one for the t\u20acam' by nationalising its toxic bank assets in 2009, at a time when there was no eurozone mechanism to provide bailout funds. That protected other eurozone banks from losses, so many feel that Ireland should be allowed to access the ESM. Germany isn't making it easy.... On his way into the last Cabinet meeting before today's budget, Irish finance minister Michael Noonan said the adjustments to the country's finances will take the Republic out of its \"disastrous phase\" that followed the boom that went bust. Noonan said: We want to position the country to exit the bailout so we can put this phase of Irish history behind us and build the economy and build the country going forward for everybody\u2019s future. He added that the government's key aim - again with the accent on working families (the \"coping classes\") - was to \u201cleave people with the bulk of their take home pay\u201d. (via Henry McDonald in Dublin). Today's budget comes three days after prime minister Enda Kenny declared that Ireland's \" economic emergency\" will end in December (more here: Enda Kenny confirms December date for Ireland's bailout exit). Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Merrion Stockbrokers, commented (via Reuters): Growth momentum is picking up, with a possible carry over into 2014 Markets will probably see it as a final step towards exiting the bail-out. Greek government debt has also strengthened in value this morning, pushing down the yield on its 10-year bills to just 8.45% this morning, down from 8.68% last night. That's close to the highest level since Greece restructured its debts in February 2012. The price of Greek bonds maturing in 2030 has hit a post-default high. This comes after Greece finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, and the ECB's Jorg Asmussen disagreed over the size of Greece's funding shortfall, and whether it needs to implement more austerity in 2014. The Wall Street Journal published the full details last night. Here's a flavour: \"First and foremost, [it] is important that they [Greece] will close the significant fiscal gap that is there for next year,\" Mr. Asmussen told reporters on his way into a meeting of euro-zone finance minister. Mr. Stournaras, however, flatly rejected the claim that there is a \"significant fiscal gap\" in the country's 2014 budget. \"In our opinion, there is no fiscal gap,\" he told reporters, adding that Mr. Asmussen didn't repeat this claim inside the meeting. It's been a good morning in Europe's stock markets, thanks to optimism that the US Congress can agree a debt ceiling increase and a budget for 2014 in time to avoid a disastrous default (see my opening posts for the backstory). Germany's DAX index is at a new lifetime high, while the French CAC has hit levels not seen since 2008. The FTSE 100 is at its highest so far this month. Only Italy, where the government is locked in discussions over its own 2014 budget, failed to rally. The relief came after Senate leaders declared last night they'd made real progress towards a deal. Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, said investors were keen to get into equities before a US deal is announced. This morning's strong German ZEW confidence reading was also cheering the City. Morris also pointed out that an index of small US firms hit a record high yesterday: Either markets have absolute faith that politicians in the US will ultimately do the right thing, or have simply become numb to big macro shocks in the last few years, but to see the US Russell small cap index posting fresh all time high\u2019s as a deadline dubbed \u201cfinancial apocalypse\u201d sits so close seems dangerous to say the least. Here's the latest prices in Europe: FTSE 100: up 60 points at 6568, + 1% German DAX: up 67 points at 8791, +0.77% French CAC: up 26 points at4249, +0.6% Italian FTSE MIB: flat Spanish IBEX: up 46 points at 9743, + 0.5% A US debt ceiling deal will, as the cliche has it, kick the can down the road. The question is, how far. Sebastien Galy of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale comments: Kick it like Beckham..... The eternal question is whether it is his left foot or the right one. The outlines of the senate debt ceiling deal suggest such a kick down the road with the main work left to a committee (tax code..). I leave you the judge of which foot they used. Given the success of such committees, it is a delaying tactic suggesting a series of hard fought battles lie ahead for the incumbent administration. The UK government has denied that this morning's increase in UK house prices to a record high (according to the ONS) means its new Help to Buy scheme is a mistake. A HM Treasury spokesperson said: We\u2019re encouraged to see signs that house prices are recovering from a low base alongside the wider economy. However, the government understands that the housing and mortgage markets are yet to return to their long run levels, leaving too many people \u2013 especially first-time buyers \u2013 struggling to afford historically high level of deposits. That\u2019s why the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee is a vital tool to give young people the same opportunity to get a foot on the property ladder as previous generations. Should also flag up an interesting blogpost on FT Alphaville by Dan McCrum this morning, showing how London (and UK) house prices are some way below their pre-crisis peak once you adjust for inflation: Wait what, the enormous unnoticed collapse in London property prices It's an important day in Ireland, where the government is preparing to announce its budget for 2014. The broad message is expected to be another year of spending cuts and fiscal squeeze, but there could be a few measures to help the public Ministers are already arguing that today's budget will help those trying to cope with Ireland's long austerity drive. From Dublin, Henry McDonald sets the scene: Rising star in the main party of government, Fine Gael, Brian Hayes sets the tone for today's budget by portraying it as a range of measures to help the \"coping classes\" of Ireland. The Junior Minister's choice of phrase echoes Ed Miliband's reference to the \"Squeezed middle\", the middle classes and the working poor, who have continued to work and pay their taxes in the midst of the economic crash, the age of austerity and the cost of living crisis. But there will be as much as George Osborne as Ed Balls or Miliband in today's budget delivered this afternoon in the Dail by two ministers: Fine Gael's Finance Minister Michael Noonon and Labour's Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin. In an appeal to the \"coping classes\" especially those with small children the government will announce its well flagged up plan to give free GP care to all under 5s in Ireland. This measure is seen as a major concession to the Labour Party in the Coalition and will be trumpeted as one designed to help young, working families AKA the \"coping classes\" AKA \"the squeezed middle.\" Noonan will reveal a range of cuts totalling \u20ac2.5bn including a hefty reduction in unemployment benefit to the jobless under the age of 25. Their jobseeker's will be slashed from the current \u20ac144 per week to \u20ac100. And the age of eligibility for the full social payment of \u20ac188 (still one of the most generous in the whole of the EU) per week will be raised to the age of 26. Prescription charges for medicines will be raised from \u20ac1.50 to \u20ac2.50. Citizens digging deep to pay for a range of medications in the Republic will be looking enviously across the border to Northern Ireland where their counterparts pay nothing for prescriptions. In what could be a political gamble given that they are the one section of the Irish population inclined to get out and vote, the Fine Gael-Labour coalition have put pressure for the first time in years on Ireland's pensioners. This interest group, normally immune from budget cuts, will experience some cost cutting measures. One in ten of all pensioners over 70 will lose their full medical card entitling them to free health care. A subsidy of \u20ac114 per year to pay pensioners' telephone bills will also be scrapped while a death grant to pay for funerals - worth \u20ac850 until today - will be abolished. Irish pensioners however will remain among the most well off OAP's anywhere in the EU because they will continue to enjoy free travel (north and south of the border), a free TV license and subsidies to their gas and electricity bills. Overall there is expected to be around \u20ac900 million raised in new taxes to reach today's budget target of savings. Henry adds that the debate on the budget, which begins with Michael Noonan's speech to the Dail around 2.30pm, is likely to last until the early evening. From China, chancellor George Osborne tweets that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited will soon become the first Chinese mainland bank to sell a renminbi bond in the City. The news comes as Osborne continues to lead a ministerial delegation to China. Overnight, the two countries also announced plans to allow Chinese banks to open branches in London, an agreement to allow sterling to be traded directly against the renminbi, and a \u00a38.2bn quote for UK banks to invest in Chinese securities. More here. The gold price has hit a new three month low today, shedding $18 from its early-morning high to $1,257 per ounce. That could be people moving out of gold and into shares (Europe's markets are still up), and also reflects the US dollar rising against most currencies this morning (so you should need fewer dollars to buy a lump of gold). Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, summed up the markets: Equities looking perky, US dollar gaining lost ground versus other currencies, gold reversing previous session gains... and bonds falling out of favour on risk-on mood currently sweeping price-action. US lawmakers are finally making headway on a deal to avert financial destruction before Thursday\u2019s D-day deadline, propping up market sentiment in overnight trade across US and Asian share markets, pulling up Europe this morning. Gold's been volatile for a while, driven in part by speculation on when the Federal Reserve will ease its stimulus programme. If the progress in Washington does lead to a deal, that might help to put Fed 'tapering' back on the agenda (or put another way, it's hard to see the Fed ending its money printing if the US is flirting with default). Around half the trades in Royal Mail so far today are small investors selling their allocation of 227 shares, according to IG's David Jones. He also sees signs that traders are taking the opportunity to 'short' Royal Mail -- betting that it will drop in the coming days. Economic confidence in Germany has hit its highest level since April 2010, as Europe's powerhouse remained calm in the face of US budget and debt ceiling deadlock. The monthly ZEW index jumped to 52.8, much better than forecasts of 49.6. ZEW, the German think tank, said 'good early indicators' in the domestic and eurozone economy were had driven sentiment. Without the problems in the US, the reading could have been even higher, it added. Here's more news flashes from Reuters: 15-Oct-2013 10:11 - ZEW ECONOMIST - RECESSION IN EURO ZONE IS BOTTOMING OUT 15-Oct-2013 10:12 - ZEW ECONOMIST - EURO ZONE CRISIS IS OVER, FOR THE MOMENT In other UK economic news, house prices in the UK have hit a new record high. The ONS's monthly house price index increased to 185.8, beating the previous peak set in January 2008. That means the average price of a house or flat in the UK is now \u00a3247,000 - with London and the South East leading the way. Sky's Ed Conway tweets the key points: While Capital Economic's Matthew Pointon urges caution: Rising education costs also helped keep UK inflation at 2.7% in September. The ONS reports that they rose by 21.4% compared with a year ago, the highest annual rise in education prices since records began in 1997. Here's James Knightley of ING's take: Fuel was the main dampening influence with the YoY rate for this component dropping to -1.6%. However, food price inflation rose in YoY terms while air fares also made a big upwards contribution and education costs, which were up 21.4%YoY, saw the fastest annual rise since records began. This graph shows how CPI inflation has been volatile over the last decade, and hasn't hit the Bank of England's 2% target in close to four years. The pound rose on the news that UK inflation was higher than forecast - gaining a quarter of a cent to above $1.60. And Britain's borrowing costs have also increased. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year gilts up 0.05 percentage points to 2.802%, the highest since September 25th, as the price of the bond falls. Traders may be anticipating that higher inflation will force the Bank of England to raise interest rates earlier than planned, and that there's even less chance of another quantitative easing (bond-buying) programme. Just in - UK inflation was unchanged last month, defying expectations that the rising cost of living would ease. The Consumer Prices index came in at 2.7% on an annual basis in September. Economists had predicted that CPI would ease to 2.6%. Price rose by 0.4% on a month-on-month basis, the Office for National Statistics said. The ONS reported that the largest upward contribution came from air fares, though this was offset by a downward contribution from petrol and diesel prices. The Retail Prices Index edged down from 3.3% to 3.2%. The ONS also reported that Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices are 4.3% higher than a year ago, while alcoholic beverages were up 5.4%. More to follow.... Looking at Royal Mail again, a lot of the trades passing through the City this morning are for exactly 227 shares: That's members of the public selling the shares they received last week, banking a profit of over \u00a3300. Here's our news story on the surprise news this morning that Angela Ahrendts is leaving Burberry for a new senior role at Apple: Burberry chief Angela Ahrendts leaves for new job at Apple In the eurozone, European Council president Herman Van Rompuy has reportedly declared that the existential threat to the euro is \"behind us\". Van Rompuy also told an audience in Cyprus that the EU will continue to stand by Cyprus as it implements its bailout programme (which has already helped push it into a steep recession). He's been holding a press conference with president Nicos Anastasiades, from where his staff have tweeted a picture: This morning's rally has pushed Germany's DAX to a record high, in fact, while France's CAC is at a five-year high. All Europe's major stock indices are higher this morning, on hopes that the progress made in Washington last night will translate into a debt ceiling and budget deal. Here's a snapshot, with the FTSE 100 gaining 0.6% , German's DAX up nearly 0.5% and the French, Spanish and Italian markets rising a more modest 0.2-0.3%. Monex Capital reckons that Wall Street may open flat, while traders watch for a real breakthrough on Capitol Hill: Market sentiment appears to be turning once again with traders becoming increasingly optimistic that a solution will be found to the impasse in Washington before the money essentially runs out on Thursday. Asian equities have been given some support off the back of this especially through the latter part of the session and US futures are now pointing towards a relatively flat start at the open, although it's obviously worth bearing in mind that some lawmakers may want to string this out until quite literally the eleventh hour. More reaction to the City losing Angela Ahrendts to Apple, on a morning in which Burberry also reported a 17% jump in underlying retail revenues. Retail analyst Nick Bubb: A year ago, Burberry caused some consternation by warning that an unexpected slump in Chinese tourist footfall had hit its Retail sales last autumn, so today\u2019s pre-close trading update was expected to strike a more cheerful tone and it is, with Retail sales up by 17%, but the big surprise is the news that the CEO, Angela Ahrendts, is off to join Apple and Christopher Bailey is taking over! Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers: Whatever the ramifications may be, it seems that the she leaves the company in good shape. Total revenues for the period were up 14%, with retail sales also rising on the back of a strong contribution from the Asian Pacific area. Revenues were also robust in Europe and the Middle East, whilst the Americas also enjoyed high single digit growth. Indeed, the company\u2019s geographical diversification continues to underpin its performance, whilst the careful investment strategy is reaping rewards. Less positively, the recent comments of the departing CEO on the longer term prospects for China were unsettling, whilst of course the change at the helm will provide some caution in regards to continuity. In addition, the company\u2019s very existence is one at the mercy of fashion, and there are no signs that the fierceness of competition is about to subside. On Royal Mail, MPs are reportedly planning to haul the government's advisors in to justify floating Royal Mail at a valuation of \u00a33.3bn. Sky's Mark Kleinman has the story: A panel of MPs is poised to extend a probe into the privatisation of Royal Mail by summoning the City bankers who advised ministers on the sell-off to give evidence. Sky News has learnt that some members of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee (BIS) want to interview executives from the syndicate of banks responsible for pricing the initial public offering (IPO) at 330p-per-share. This morning's share price rise values Royal Mail at \u00a34.85bn.... It's the first morning of full trading in Royal Mail shares, and they're climbing. Shares in Royal Mail have risen another 10p to 485p, which is a gain of 2% today -- or 47% on the 330p at which Britain's postal service was floated last week. Members of the public are looking at a \u00a3300 profit if they sell now. City commentator David Buik points out that 500 big investors were left with nothing in last week's hugely over-subscribed IPO, so may be keen to buy shares this morning, even though a strike ballot is looming. Burberry shares have opened 5.5% lower following the news that CEO Angela Ahrendts is leaving to join Apple. Europe's stock markets are up in early trading, with the FTSE 100 gaining 42 points (or 0.6%). Burberry haven't traded yet, though..... Other European markets are also higher. Round-up to follow.... Big news in the City this morning -- Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts is stepping down from the fashion chain, for a new job at Apple. Ahrendts, who has been hailed for driving's Burberry success in the eight years as chief executive, will take up a new role as Apple's Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores. Apple's Tim Cook sounds delighted: She shares our values and our focus on innovation, and she places the same strong emphasis as we do on the customer experience. She has shown herself to be an extraordinary leader throughout her career and has a proven track record. It certainly looks like a great hire for Apple. It means the City is losing one of its more successful bosses, and also cuts the number of female CEOs in the FTSE 100 to just two. Burberry are promoting chief creative offices Christopher Bailey to replace Ahrendts. Sir John Peace, Chairman of Burberry, said he has no doubt Bailey will \"keep Burberry on the forefront creatively, digitally and financially\". No pressure.... Here's the Apple statement..... and here's the Burberry one. Senate majority leader Harry Reid fuelled hopes of a deal last night when he told reporters that he and minority leader Mitch McConnell had made \"tremendous progress\" towards a deal. My US colleague Ed Pilkington rounded up the state of play in Washington last night: Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority and minority leaders, held two lengthy meetings on Monday in an attempt to nail down terms of a possible compromise. The urgency of the talks was matched by the scale of the crisis facing them: unless an agreement is reached on raising America\u2019s borrowing limit by midnight on Thursday, the US will begin to default on its payments, with possible global economic ramifications. Obama postponed a 3pm White House gathering of congressional leaders to give McConnell and Reid extra time to fine-tune a package. \"My hope is that a spirit of co-operation will move us forward over the next few hours,\" the president said earlier in the day, adding the ominous note that \"if we don't start making some real progress in the House and the Senate, and if Republicans aren't willing to set aside some of their partisan concerns in order to do what's right for the country, we stand a good chance of defaulting.\" More here: Senate leaders close in on debt ceiling deal after lengthy talks on Capitol Hill Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. European stock markets are expected to rise this morning, on hopes that American politicians can finally agree a deal to raise the US debt ceiling and pass a new budget for 2014. Last night, Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate were racing to agree a compromise that would extend the US debt limit beyond the $16.7trn limit which it could hit on Thursday. Talks at the White House were postponed until today, to allow Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority and minority leaders, more time to carve a plan. Although there's no guarantee of a deal, the sense of renewed urgency is likely to push shares higher in Europe. Here's IG's early calls: Ahead of the European open we are calling the FTSE at 6540 +33, DAX 8762 +39, CAC 4242 +20, IBEX 9753 +43 and MIB 19006 +89 Asian markets have already welcomed the signs of progress, with the South Korean market up 1.2% and the Australian market gaining 1%. But the deadlock of the last fortnight (this is day 15 of the federal government shutdown) has also left many analysts speculating about the long-term damage caused to America's dominant place in the financial markets. I'll round up the latest comments shortly. The agenda Also coming up today -- the Irish government will announce its own budget for 2014, the seventh 'austerity budget' in a row. That comes at 4.30pm BST. EU finance ministers are gathering for an ECOFIN meeting in Luxembourg, following yesterday's eurogroup gathering. We also get the latest UK inflation data at 9.30am, and the ZEW survey of German investor confidence. And in the City, Royal Mail shares will begin trading fully on the stock market, after two days of conditional trading in which they rocketed almost 44%, from the 330p float price to 475p last night.",

This measure is seen as a major concession to the Labour Party in the Coalition and will be trumpeted as one designed to help young, working families AKA the \"coping classes\" AKA \"the squeezed middle.\"</p> <p>Noonan will reveal a range of cuts totalling \u20ac2.5bn including a hefty reduction in unemployment benefit to the jobless under the age of 25. Their jobseeker's will be slashed from the current \u20ac144 per week to \u20ac100. And the age of eligibility for the full social payment of \u20ac188 (still one of the most generous in the whole of the EU) per week will be raised to the age of 26.&#xa0;</p> <p>Prescription charges for medicines will be raised from \u20ac1.50 to \u20ac2.50. Citizens digging deep to pay for a range of medications in the Republic will be looking enviously across the border to Northern Ireland where their counterparts pay nothing for prescriptions.&#xa0;</p> <p>In what could be a political gamble given that they are the one section of the Irish population inclined to get out and vote, the Fine Gael-Labour coalition have put pressure for the first time in years on Ireland's pensioners. This interest group, normally immune from budget cuts, will experience some cost cutting measures. One in ten of all pensioners over 70 will lose their full medical card entitling them to free health care. A subsidy of \u20ac114 per year to pay pensioners' telephone bills will also be scrapped while a death grant to pay for funerals - worth \u20ac850 until today - will be abolished.&#xa0;</p> <p>Irish pensioners however will remain among the most well off OAP's anywhere in the EU because they will continue to enjoy free travel (north and south of the border), a free TV license and subsidies to their gas and electricity bills.&#xa0;</p> <p>Overall there is expected to be around \u20ac900 million raised in new taxes to reach today's budget target of savings.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Henry adds that the debate on the budget, which begins with Michael Noonan's speech to the Dail around 2.30pm, is likely to last until the early evening.&#xa0;</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T10:37:24.809Z\">at 11.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-525d11b5e4b0885bd26bee58\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T10:09:39.495Z\">11.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>From China, chancellor George Osborne</strong> tweets that the&#xa0;Industrial and Commercial Bank of China&#xa0;Limited will soon become the first Chinese mainland bank to sell a renminbi bond in&#xa0;the City.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/statuses/390053529001664512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ICBC will issue an RMB bond in London next month.

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail boss Moya Greene has called for \"protections\" from strikes as more than 100,000 postal workers prepare to announce plans for industrial action that could take place as soon as 23 October. In an interview to mark Royal Mail's first official day as a public company, Greene said: \"We need to start thinking about what sort of protections do we need as a company from our people, from what has been probably too quick an approach to resort to industrial action. \"I just think we need to look at alternative ways to resolve disputes,\" she told ITV News. Greene's comments come as the Communication Workers Union (CWU) prepares to announce the result of a strike ballot on Wednesday. The CWU, which represents more than 115,000 of Royal Mail's 150,000 employees, said it was \"confident\" that its members will vote on Wednesday for industrial action. It is understood that the union has already made tentative plans for days of disruption in the run-up to Christmas. Dave Ward, the CWU's deputy general secretary, said: \"The Royal Mail share price has soared further today, bringing more proof that the company was undervalued by the government's City mates. \"The taxpayer has lost over \u00a31bn already in this bungled fire sale of a cherished national institution. Postal workers cannot trade their shares for three years and they are far more concerned about their jobs than the share price. We're confident our members will return a yes vote in tomorrow's ballot result for strike action, strengthening our position to secure a deal on protecting jobs, services and terms and conditions in the company.\" Royal Mail's shares have soared by 44% since the government privatised the 500-year-old company on Friday. The share price spike means the 690,000 people who managed to buy a stake in the company have made paper profits of more than \u00a3300. It also means the government could have collected at least more than \u00a3800m more for the taxpayer if it had sold the shares at 450p rather than 330p. The shares are currently changing hands at 481p. Adrian Bailey, the Labour chair of the business department select committee, said the share price surge \"vindicated\" concerns the committee raised when it questioned the business secretary, Vince Cable, last week. \"At the meeting last week it's fair to say that members of the committee had one view and the secretary of state had another,\" Bailey said. \"The share price movements have vindicated the concerns of the committee members.

Investors will be able to apply for licences to buy Chinese stocks and bonds \u2013 rather than having to go via Hong Kong \u2013 with an initial quota of 80bn yuan (\u00a38.2bn), under the extension of the Renminbi Qualified Financial Institutional Investor scheme. Chinese banks will also be able to apply to open wholesale branches in Britain, rather than using tightly regulated subsidiaries \u2013 encouraging them to expand their activity in the UK. \"Today we agreed the next big step in making London \u2013 already the global centre for finance \u2013 a major global centre for trading and investing the Chinese currency too,\" the chancellor told reporters at a briefing in Beijing on Tuesday after talks with the Chinese vice-premier Ma Kai. \"More trade and more investment means more business and more jobs for Britain.\" Osborne's five-day trade mission marks a thaw in bilateral relations after China called off high-level visits over David Cameron's meeting with the Dalai Lama last year. The UK and China have also agreed to allow direct trading between sterling and the yuan, rather than via the dollar. The pound will become the fourth currency to trade directly with the yuan, following the US and Australian dollars and the yen, though it is unclear when trading will begin. China is seeking to internationalise its currency, but is treading cautiously due to fears over volatility. The UK is already a global hub for trading other currencies. Britain accounts for 62% of yuan trading outside China and Hong Kong. Daily trade in London has risen to around $5bn (\u00a33.1bn) since it began last year. Osborne later announced on Twitter that the ICBC bank would issue a yuan bond in London next month. Chinese banks have been pushing hard for the right to open branches and several warned the Treasury last year that they were moving much of their business to Luxembourg because of the restrictions imposed by their subsidiary status. The new arrangements will allow them to deal with companies and financial institutions, but not individual customers. Branch status allows them to draw on the capital of their main operations; the hope is that they will be able to invest more in the UK. Creating new branches is cheaper and more efficient for the banks. Regulators are concerned that branches face looser controls; but should they need rescuing, their home governments must take responsibility, while Britain covers subsidiaries. Banks from the US and several European countries have branches in the UK. The two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding on civil nuclear co-operation, paving the way for a Chinese state-owned nuclear power company to join EDF Energy in building a new plant at Hinkley Point. \"Chinese investment in our infrastructure is welcome,\" said Osborne. \"Like all investments they have to be done in an open and transparent way, but we have seen investment already in London's water supply and Heathrow airport and we have found China to be very straightforward partners in investment. Equally, there is a huge amount of British investment in China.\" Other announcements by the chancellor include Chinese investment in Manchester's Airport City development and visa changes to encourage wealthy Chinese people to visit the UK. Mark Henderson, chairman of the London Luxury Quarter, said the new procedures could give an enormous boost to the fortunes of British retailers. Chinese tourists spent \u00a3262m across Mayfair, Piccadilly and St James's in 2012, a 32% increase year-on-year. But at present Britain gets only 200,000 of the two million Chinese who visit Europe annually.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Inflation higher than expected with energy price rise on way", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation was higher than expected last month, keeping household budgets under pressure even before the next round of energy bill increases come in this winter. Official statistics show the consumer price measure of inflation put prices in September at 2.7% higher than a year ago. That was unchanged from August and defied economists' expectations that inflation would edge down to 2.6% in a Reuters poll. The Office for National Statistics said the main upward pressure on prices came from air fares falling by less than a year ago, offset somewhat by falling petrol and diesel prices. But overall inflation remained above the Bank of England's target of 2% for a 46th straight month. The broader measure of inflation, the retail price index (RPI), slowed to 3.2% from 3.3%, as expected. The September inflation figure will be used to calculate next year's increase in business rates and retailers said the increase would mean an additional \u00a3242m in payments for high street businesses that were already struggling, putting 19,670 full time jobs at risk due to potential shop closures. The stronger-than-expected CPI inflation rate sent the pound higher and gilt prices lower as traders raised their bets on interest rate rises in the future and on the Bank holding off on any further bond-buying stimulus to the economy. Some economists said continuing price pressures increased the likelihood of the Bank raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5% sooner than its forward guidance scheme would suggest. James Knightley at ING Financial Markets said: \"The main risk is utility bills, which could rise sharply in coming months and keep inflation remaining well above the 2% central target. With house prices continuing to rise \u2026 and tomorrow's labour report set to show ongoing job gains, we continue to look for an early 2015 rate hike.\" While households brace for the lastest utility bill rises, there were some suggestions in the official data that price pressures will ease further out. The ONS also published producer price data that showed inflation in prices charged at the factory gate slowed to 1.2% last month, undershooting the forecast for 1.3%. Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said: \"The rate of growth of manufacturers' selling prices has eased markedly in recent months, down from 2.1% in July, and this easing in so-called industry pipeline price pressures suggests that consumer price inflation may also cool in coming months. \"However, against this is the worrying price of oil and energy. With Brent crude trading at an average of $111 (\u00a369) per barrel in October, oil is trading at a price that is historically consistent with inflation running higher than 2-3%. Add to this the widely reported anticipated increases in domestic utility bills, there is a significant risk that we can see inflation remaining stickier than the Bank is currently expecting.\" Adding to a series of house price indicators that suggest the property market is hotting up, at least in some areas, the ONS said house prices rose 3.8% in the year to August. That was the fastest rise for almost three years and is likely to be seized on by critics of George Osborne's Help to Buy housing loans scheme, who fear it could create a bubble. The Treasury sought to highlight the longer-term trend in inflation. A spokesman said: \"Inflation has fallen and is nearly half of its peak of 5.2%. The economy is turning a corner, but risks to the recovery remain high.\"",

The broader measure of inflation, the retail price index (RPI), slowed to 3.2% from 3.3%, as expected.</p> <p>The September inflation figure will be used to calculate next year's increase in business rates and retailers said the increase would mean an additional \u00a3242m in payments for high street businesses that were already struggling, putting 19,670 full time jobs at risk due to potential shop closures.</p> <p>The stronger-than-expected CPI inflation rate sent the pound higher and gilt prices lower as traders raised their bets on interest rate rises in the future and on the Bank holding off on any further bond-buying stimulus to the economy. Some economists said continuing price pressures increased the likelihood of the Bank raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5% sooner than its forward guidance scheme would suggest.</p> <p>James Knightley at ING Financial Markets said: \"The main risk is utility bills, which could rise sharply in coming months and keep inflation remaining well above the 2% central target. With house prices continuing to rise&#xa0;\u2026 and tomorrow's labour report set to show ongoing job gains, we continue to look for an early 2015 rate hike.\"</p> <p>While households brace for the lastest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill\" title=\"\">utility bill rises</a>, there were some suggestions in the official data that price pressures will ease further out. The ONS also published producer price data that showed inflation in prices charged at the factory gate slowed to 1.2% last month, undershooting the forecast for 1.3%.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, an economist at Markit, said: \"The rate of growth of manufacturers' selling prices has eased markedly in recent months, down from 2.1% in July, and this easing in so-called industry pipeline price pressures suggests that consumer price inflation may also cool in coming months.</p> <p>\"However, against this is the worrying price of oil and energy. With Brent crude trading at an average of $111 (\u00a369) per barrel in October, oil is trading at a price that is historically consistent with inflation running higher than 2-3%. Add to this the widely reported anticipated increases in domestic utility bills, there is a significant risk that we can see inflation remaining stickier than the Bank is currently expecting.\"</p> <p>Adding to a series of house price indicators that suggest the property market is hotting up, at least in some areas, the ONS said house prices rose 3.8% in the year to August. That was the fastest rise for almost three years and is likely to be seized on by critics of George Osborne's Help to Buy housing loans scheme, who fear it could create a bubble.</p> <p>The Treasury sought to highlight the longer-term trend in inflation.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Inflation has fallen and is nearly half of its peak of 5.2%. The economy is turning a corner, but risks to the recovery remain high.\"</p>",
