Nine hotels are being built or restored around the city centre. Their arrival correlates with the huge upturn in holidaymakers visiting the Greek capital since a low point in late 2008, when Athens erupted into riots after the police killing of a teenage boy. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle, what\u2019s been happening in Athens,\u201d Greece\u2019s tourism chief, Andreas Andreadis, told the Observer. \u201cThe tourist industry in Greece grew two to three times faster than in Spain, Portugal, Italy or France last year. This year we expect around 4.5 million visitors in Athens alone.\u201d For an economy stuck in depression-era recession, dependent on emergency bails and seemingly locked in a perpetual fiscal vice, tourism is vital. A record 23.5 million holidaymakers visited Greece in 2015 \u2013 generating \u20ac14.2bn in direct receipts, or 24% of gross domestic product. In 2010, at the start of the country\u2019s debt crisis \u2013 which has seen it struggle to avert default and remain in the euro \u2013 revenues from tourism were \u20ac10bn, or 15% of GDP. The Greek Tourism Confederation, Sete, is predicting another bumper season for an industry that has long been the single biggest contributor to the economy and job market. Arrivals could reach 25 million (27.5 million including cruise ship passengers), which is more than twice the country\u2019s population. Economic recovery will depend on the sector to a great degree. Andreadis said: \u201cIf we get 1.5 million more visitors it will produce an additional \u20ac800m in direct receipts. Such a positive kick that would come in the third and fourth quarters.\u201d Much of the upsurge is linked to Greece\u2019s safety record. Tourists are staying away from resort in Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey and elsewhere in the wake of high-profile attacks. Countries whose economies are also dependent on holidaymakers have suffered incalculable damage following a severe drop in arrivals. Travel advice from governments and fears of fresh violence are simply keeping tourists away. But other countries\u2019 loss could be Greece\u2019s gain. And it could not come at a better time: tourism provides one in five jobs in Greece, at a time when unemployment in the effectively bankrupt nation has hovered stubbornly around 25%. Youth unemployment stands at an astonishing 67%. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge but our hope is that we will see an improvement on record numbers again,\u201d said Yiannis Retsos, president of the Hellenic Federation of Hoteliers. \u201cTourism is all about positive psychology and Greece is a safe place in the south-east Mediterranean region.\u201d But while price wars have played a role in securing bookings this year, industry figures also worry about the leftist-led government\u2019s business plan and its appetite for raising tax rates. VAT has jumped from 6.5% to 13% on accommodation prices and from 13% to 24% on food and beverages. An extra surcharge announced by the government in a bid to appease the creditors keeping debt-stricken Greece afloat was postponed last week under pressure from tourism officials . \u201cTaxes by definition work against business,\u201d says Retsos. \u201cThis is a sector that outperforms all others, but I worry about competitiveness and the product we offer now being overtaxed. In a recession it is impossible for businesses to absorb the total percentage of increased taxes.\u201d Greece\u2019s role on the frontline of Europe\u2019s refugee crisis \u2013 more than 53,000 men, women and children are now stuck in limbo in several places around the country following the closure of borders to its north \u2013 could also have a negative impact. Sitting in Sete\u2019s air-conditioned offices in Athens, Andreadis says the image of desperate refugees camped on island quays \u2013 and most dramatically in the port of Piraeus just outside the city \u2013 will also be a drag on the sector if the situation is allowed to continue. But sounding a rare note of optimism, the tourism chief said the deal Greece made last week in its long-running, and often turbulent, talks with foreign lenders was also cause to be confident. The completion of the review \u2013 and the disbursement of a further \u20ac10.3bn in emergency funds \u2013 would, he predicted, see liquidity and stability quickly return to Greece\u2019s cash-starved real economy. \u201cClosing the agreement will see the market stabilise. It will end speculation of Grexit, which impacts tourism in terms of prepayment [for holidays],\u201d he added. \u201cCountries with unstable currencies are not tourists\u2019 first choice. The return of stability ends that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The string of terror attacks in Europe and further afield since last summer has sent reverberations through the travel industry, but Thomas Cook, arguably Britain\u2019s best known tour operator, has felt the effects more than most. Its chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, has warned the industry is suffering the worst disruption in his 30-year career. The company\u2019s shares lost almost a fifth of their value this month when it revealed falling bookings as passengers steered clear of trouble spots. That warning coincided with the disappearance of an EgyptAir flight on its way from Paris to Cairo, renewing concerns that consumers would be reluctant to travel. The plane was later found to have crashed into the sea, killing all 66 people on board, though the cause has not yet been established. Thomas Cook\u2019s previous trading update, in March, came on the same day terrorists attacked Brussels airport. It followed the murder of 130 people in Paris in November, the killing of 38 holidaymakers in Tunisia in June and the October bombing of a Russian plane flying from Egypt that killed 224 people. The first three months of this year have seen a series of attacks in Turkey, which 2.5 million Britons visit each year. Thomas Cook\u2019s second-biggest market is Turkey, but visitor numbers tumbled 28% in April \u2013 the biggest fall in 17 years. To add to the pressure on holiday companies, the UK economy has been slowing, consumer confidence is shaky and wage growth weak, while next month\u2019s referendum on EU membership has helped push down the value of the pound against the euro and the dollar. Ryanair and easyJet, Europe\u2019s biggest carriers, were forced to cut prices after the Paris attacks and both have said seats will be cheaper than last year over the holiday season. Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary spoke of a price war, characteristically declaring his company would be the inevitable winner because of its size and aggressive pricing. Yet despite all the doom-laden talk, total UK bookings for package holidays this summer are up 6% from a year ago, according to GfK, which compiles a weekly survey of agents and operators. Britons\u2019 commitment to their annual break survived the Great Recession and it appears to remain a top priority. Early bookings for winter and next summer are up 22% and 18% respectively. Acting on Foreign Office advice, tour operators are not flying to Tunisia or the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, which has been reduced to little more than a ghost town, helping send overall bookings to the country down by almost two thirds. The government advises people to be wary when travelling to Turkey, where bookings are down by a third. There has been a surge away from these perceived danger spots to the familiarity of the western Mediterranean, which Britons first started jetting to in the late 1960s. Bookings for Spain are up 27% this year, with Portugal up 30% and Italy up 12% over last year. Greece is coming out of the doldrums: business is up 4% following a huge rise last year. Thomas Cook has moved the bookings of 1.2 million customers who had arranged holidays in Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt to these countries and to long-haul destinations such as Mexico, the US and Cuba. There has been a corresponding effect on prices in Europe. Last month it cost about \u00a3170 less per person to book two weeks in Turkey compared with last year, but the equivalent trip to Portugal is \u00a394 more expensive and rising. David Hope, GfK\u2019s business group director, says: \u201cPrices are going up and up and up.\u201d But he says this is only healthy for tour operators if they can provide enough rooms to meet demand. \u201cIt\u2019s looking quite healthy at the moment but the concern is that if the likes of Spain and Portugal become booked up, will they have stock left that people want to buy?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is left will be lower-grade property they can get in Spain or hotels in Turkey \u2013 and do people want to go there?\u201d Thomas Cook\u2019s rival, Tui, which owns Thomson, has fared better because it is bigger in Spain and relies less on Turkey. It has also gone upmarket by operating its own boutique-style hotels \u2013 a model Thomas Cook is trying to copy. Wyn Ellis, an analyst at the City broker Numis, says: \u201cThat seems to be a more resilient part of the market, partly because it tends to book earlier. At the commodity end of the market, people will book a lot later because they think they can get bargains.\u201d The industry turmoil has also hit the budget airlines. Dame Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, said she was forced to slash prices following the Paris attacks in November. Both Ryanair and easyJet have reported demand returning to normal but prices are likely to stay low. Ryanair predicted its fares would be down 7% over the next 10 months. Robin Byde, an analyst at broker Cantor Fitzgerald, says: \u201cThe thing to remember with easyJet and Ryanair is that between them they have more than 20% of European short-haul traffic. They are price-makers as well as price-takers, so you have to take it with a pinch of salt when they talk about pressures driving down prices.\u201d The biggest influence on air fares is the cost of fuel, which has more than halved in the past two years. Because big airlines buy their fuel up to two years in advance, they have only recently felt the benefit of the falling oil price and have plenty of scope to cut fares. That is handy for them because smaller airlines, which can\u2019t buy fuel as far in advance, have cut prices and laid on extra flights to sell more seats. EasyJet and Ryanair both plan to increase capacity, and the result is that European short-haul capacity is up about 8% this year. \u201cEasyJet and Ryanair, as big operators in the market, are trying to squeeze out smaller operators so they offer discounts and attractive fares and hope that the competition fails,\u201d Byde says. The received wisdom in the industry is that travelling is now so much a part of everyday life that demand will always bounce back after shocks. McCall reiterated that comforting message when the airline announced its results. \u201cDemand always comes back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that with both the tragic events that have happened [last] year and we\u2019ve seen that in the past. If you are a consumer, it\u2019s a very, very good time to fly.\u201d",

Ryanair predicted its fares would be down 7% over the next 10 months.</p> <p>Robin Byde, an analyst at broker Cantor Fitzgerald, says: \u201cThe thing to remember with easyJet and Ryanair is that between them they have more than 20% of European short-haul traffic. They are price-makers as well as price-takers, so you have to take it with a pinch of salt when they talk about pressures driving down prices.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest influence on air fares is the cost of fuel, which has more than halved in the past two years. Because big airlines buy their fuel up to two years in advance, they have only recently felt the benefit of the falling oil price and have plenty of scope to cut fares.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e39beb94e711b659e9fb4d02d30ab189c2e2db53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e39beb94e711b659e9fb4d02d30ab189c2e2db53/0_170_3744_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Micha Theiner/City AM/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is handy for them because smaller airlines, which can\u2019t buy fuel as far in advance, have cut prices and laid on extra flights to sell more seats. EasyJet and Ryanair both plan to increase capacity, and the result is that European short-haul capacity is up about 8% this year.</p> <p>\u201cEasyJet and Ryanair, as big operators in the market, are trying to squeeze out smaller operators so they offer discounts and attractive fares and hope that the competition fails,\u201d Byde says.</p> <p>The received wisdom in the industry is that travelling is now so much a part of everyday life that demand will always bounce back after shocks. McCall reiterated that comforting message when the airline announced its results. \u201cDemand always comes back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that with both the tragic events that have happened [last] year and we\u2019ve seen that in the past. If you are a consumer, it\u2019s a very, very good time to fly.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a clear day, a Frenchman with a pair of binoculars could get a decent glimpse of the challenges facing Britain\u2019s railway network by peering across the Channel at Dover. Until last Christmas, a high-speed train would travel at half pace along the old line at the bottom of the cliffs, giving commuters a direct fast link to Folkestone and the capital via HS1\u2019s tracks. Then a combination of storm and tide so damaged the sea wall that passengers from Dover and beyond now have to transfer miserably on buses as engineers work to repair the damage. In this part of the south-east, more and more people are travelling by train, and paying a high price for it: a season ticket costs more than \u00a36,000 a year. But the capacity of the network is being sorely tested and, despite huge investment and the development of high-speed track as far as nearby Ashford \u2013 still rests on creaking infrastructure in many places. Network Rail chairman Peter Hendy, charged with reviewing in detail what its engineers can achieve for its \u00a338.5bn budget, said at a recent transport conference: \u201cWe\u2019re discovering that some of it is pretty badly built. Seen Dover?\u201d One man who has seen plenty of Dover of late is Steve Kilby, the Network Rail manager who must restore the line after cracks appeared in the sea wall. \u201cI got the call at 12.15pm on Christmas Eve. I was on annual leave \u2013 but that was the end of that.\u201d The cracks turned out to be the visible manifestation of deeper problems. The beach beneath it had shifted dramatically, exposing the sea wall\u2019s foundations to battering from the waves. The track was sitting not on solid ground but on a viaduct, buried in chalk, that was being eroded from above and below by the sea. The line was closed and the wall quickly shored up with 200 lorry-loads of rock armour \u2013 huge boulders on the beach. Commuters became frustrated by the subsequent apparent lack of action. Kilby admits that at first they had little idea of the best way to rebuild the route. Records of the construction of the sea wall in the 1920s were sparse, and there was nothing about the newly discovered mid 19th century viaduct. In the end, engineers decided the Victorians had built it for a reason. \u201cSo it came back to a viaduct,\u201d says Kilby. \u201cBut if I had a 250 metre-long bridge to do anywhere else in the UK, it would take a year to design and a year to build. We\u2019re committed to nine months.\u201d Concrete piles 30 metres deep are being cast in the ground, while 90,000 tonnes of rock is being brought on a barge from Norway to reshape this wave-battered stretch of shore, called Shakespeare beach, and build a solid new structure. But a changing climate means the future looks ever more unpredictable. \u201cAround the country, we\u2019ve been having these events that normally occur once in a 100 years, 250 years, even 1,000 years,\u201d says Kilby. In 2014, he worked at Botley in Hampshire, where a landslide blocked the line between London and the south coast, and 80 metres of embankment was washed away by torrential rain. Ageing infrastructure and the need for more capacity are the railway industry\u2019s two big challenges. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne says the best way to meet burgeoning demand is what he calls the \u201cdigital railway\u201d: bringing forward the replacement of signalling by decades so that more trains can run on the existing network. Carne told the transport select committee earlier this month that it would make the best of the tracks Britain already had: \u201cThe network will be more reliable and more resilient. It\u2019s going to cost a great deal of money \u2013 but less than the alternative.\u201d Carne says the current system is safe, but inefficient, with signalling one of the most fragile parts of the infrastructure. A detailed business case is being drawn up but the digital railway idea has influential supporters in the Department for Transport as discussions over the next five-year plan begin. Network Rail hopes that, with transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin tipped to be reshuffled out of the job after the EU referendum, a new minister will champion the project. It would have legacy potential, while avoiding the public antipathy generated by a third airport runway or HS2. But Carne is not without opponents: some in the industry say he has overstated the benefits of the digital railway while appearing to disparage its current operation. Roger Ford of industry magazine Modern Railways says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a digital railway since 1985. Mark Carne\u2019s ill-informed comments about us being in the dark ages are quite ridiculous.\u201d He added: \u201cThe capacity claims made for Carne\u2019s plan [up to 40% more trains] are extreme. It is being promoted as the universal panacea, an alternative to building new infrastructure. But if you build infrastructure, you\u2019re adding to the network, not just heating it up. Would you rather spend money on a fifth track into Waterloo \u2013 which will be there for ever \u2013 or squeeze a quart into a pint pot?\u201d Carne appeared to have taken note of such criticism when he appeared before the select committee: he was careful to state that the digital railway could only deliver certain improvements, and could not replace other work. Another expert, Jim Steer, director of rail research group Greengauge 21, said no one disputed that upgrading the UK\u2019s signalling to European Train Control System standards was a move in the right direction and could boost capacity. But he added: \u201cIf it was available everywhere, great, but it\u2019s ambitious in terms of budget. The previous plan was to time its adoption with when renewal [of signalling systems] fell due and you were going to have to spend money anyway. I\u2019m not sure it can be done by 2028, and where is the money going to come from?\u201d Although Network Rail\u2019s stock with the government has risen considerably since the early 2015, when cost overruns led to the cancellation of major projects, few expect to see large sums being made available in the near future, even if Carne insists it is money well spent. While the industry debates the technological future and ways to cram ever more passengers on to the network, the past may still come back to bite it. Steer warns: \u201cThese railways were built before people understood the basics of soil mechanics \u2013 and with climate change that has become a real issue.\u201d They know that too well in Dover, where commuters hope by Christmas to have once again their link to resilient, high-speed tracks \u2013 the modern railway that appears tantalisingly close but is for now out of reach.",

      "bodyText": "Monday is Memorial Day, the official start of summer and another celebration traditionally marked by sales and a shopping bonanza. But the sun isn\u2019t shining for US retailers. On the face of it, the economic superpower that is the American consumer should be having a party. Low interest rates and unemployment rates, low oil prices, a high stock market, healthy property prices \u2013 nothing it would seem, to put off doing what comes most naturally to them \u2013 shopping. Yet they\u2019re stubbornly refusing to do it \u2013 or at least refusing to do it in predictable ways \u2013 leaving consumer experts to wonder, as fashion bible Women\u2019s Wear Daily recently did, if the consumer psyche, \u201cbombarded by digital messages, stressed financially and overwrought emotionally\u201d, has \u201cfinally exploded\u201d. Certainly, there\u2019s conflicted evidence to suggest it has. Retail stocks for Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Gap have all fallen sharply this year, with some reporting their worst comparable sales results since the Great Recession. Last week jeweler Tiffany\u2019s reported its sharpest drop in quarterly sales since the global financial crisis pushed the world to the brink in 2008. It\u2019s an international trend. In the UK, analysts are reporting 10% declines in the number of shopper visits to high streets and shopping centres around the country over the past year. In part, the shopping slump can still be blamed on the financial crisis. Consumers\u2019 incomes have not kept pace with household spending, and they are less confident about long-term economic stability. According to a recent Pew Charitable Trust survey, American household incomes fell between 2010 and 2013. Adults in the survey questioned \u201cwhether the American Dream is within reach, and many doubt that their children will fare any better than they have\u201d. Earnings for those at the top of the economic food chain have soared. Analysis by the AFL-CIO union found that chief executive officers of the top 500 companies took home on $12.4m on average \u2013 or 355 times what an average worker makes. Yet statistics show the same psychological hurdles to spending exist across income strata. At the high end of the US property market in New York and Miami a glut of residential developments and weak demand is triggering warnings that current pricing is unsustainable and future developments or commercial-to-residential conversions are being abandoned. In the art market, record sales are being achieved but against a backdrop of reduced demand and lower volume of sales than even a year ago. Executives spoke of \u201ctrepidation\u201d and going into sales holding the hands of prospective buyers. \u201cNo one wants to be the last person at the party,\u201d said Christie\u2019s Brett Gorvy. Beneath the economics, something else has changed. A contract has been broken. Researchers say neither consumers nor brands are getting much of what they want: consumers don\u2019t want to put their money with brands that don\u2019t speak to their values, while brands aren\u2019t seeing any loyalty from consumers they are trying to cultivate. The apparent contradiction between a healthy economy and unpredictable consumer spending leads some market analysts to the conclusion that consumption as an activity was fundamentally altered by the 2008 recession. The abrupt downturn shocked consumers but also placed them firmly in the driving seat when it came to making consumer choices. When you couple this with the power that technology has afforded them to research, learn and compare about their potential purchases, it is little wonder that consumer behavior is changing, analysts say. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to start looking at the consumer in a completely different way,\u201d says Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at Golden State University. \u201cWe can\u2019t evaluate their confidence and willingness to spend in the ways we used to,\u201d says Yarrow. \u201cConsumers just don\u2019t react the way they did even five years ago. Technology has taken over and they feel more empowered.\u201d \u201cThe recession was the first step toward the complete shift in shopping,\u201d says Yarrow. \u201cConsumers are more wary and self-protective about finances, and they\u2019ve never dominated the market the way they do today. They\u2019re informed and wary, and determined to be in control.\u201d The unpredictability has caused chaos for retailers, which have seen their power over consumers begin to slip away. \u201cTechnology means they can shop however and whenever they want, or they can shop all over the world, and that\u2019s why we see retailers collapsing and relying completely on price reductions,\u201d Yarrow said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking retailers forever to realise that when people go shopping they want to see new things all the time. This is what technology has done to our brains. We want a lot more excitement and product turnover in our lives. If we don\u2019t see new product, we won\u2019t go there any more.\u201d It\u2019s a trend being observed across the consumer market. The same conscientiousness that exists in the middle market has taken hold at the top end where luxury retailers could once count on injudicious spending to pump up the books. Yarrow\u2019s research suggests even the one-percenters have adopted middle-class values. They feel guilty when they spend too much money, and quickly reject efforts to seduce them. \u201cIt\u2019s a demographic that\u2019s always been a little more entitled so patterns we\u2019re seeing in the middle of the market are more pronounced: if I don\u2019t get it how I want, when I want it, for the price I want it, I won\u2019t have it at all,\u201d she says. But there are other factors feeding into consumers\u2019 shattered psyches. For many consumers buying \u201cstuff\u201d just isn\u2019t what it used to be. People are looking toward more \u201cexperiential\u201d spending \u2013 holidays, concerts, plays \u2013 experiences that they can then share on social media. Laurent Vernhes, co-founder and CEO of Tablethotels, a consumer website that specialises in high-end travel, told the Guardian \u201cthe more jaded you are the more you will seek experiential travel and beyond what you know.\u201d And it\u2019s not just holidaymakers \u2013 business people, too, want experiences. Instead of heading to the mall on Monday, post-recession consumers are more likely to start planning their next vacation or trying to bag tickets for Hamilton. The hangover from hard times and a technological shift in power have reordered consumer priorities. Consumers\u2019 psyches may be shattered but they don\u2019t want them put back together. \u201cThis is a much more conscious consumer,\u201d Yarrow says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go back to pre-2008. They want the power, and they want control.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Monday is Memorial Day, the official start of summer and another celebration traditionally marked by sales and a shopping bonanza. But the sun isn\u2019t shining for US retailers.<br></p> <p>On the face of it, the economic superpower that is the American consumer should be having a party. Low interest rates and unemployment rates, low oil prices, a high stock market, healthy property prices \u2013 nothing it would seem, to put off doing what comes most naturally to them \u2013 shopping.<br></p> <p>Yet they\u2019re stubbornly refusing to do it \u2013 or at least refusing to do it in predictable ways \u2013 leaving consumer experts to wonder, as fashion bible Women\u2019s Wear Daily recently did, if the consumer psyche, \u201cbombarded by digital messages, stressed financially and overwrought emotionally\u201d, has <a href=\"http://wwd.com/business-news/forecasts-analysis/economy-consumer-anxiety-10424841/\">\u201cfinally exploded\u201d</a>.<br></p> <p>Certainly, there\u2019s conflicted evidence to suggest it has. Retail stocks for Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Gap have all fallen sharply this year, with some reporting their worst comparable sales results since the Great Recession. Last week jeweler Tiffany\u2019s reported its sharpest drop in quarterly sales since the global financial crisis pushed the world to the brink in 2008.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/uk-high-street-spending-shoppers-slowdown\">international trend</a>. In the UK, analysts are reporting 10% declines in the number of shopper visits to high streets and shopping centres around the country over the past year.</p> <p>In part, the shopping slump can still be blamed on the financial crisis. Consumers\u2019 incomes have not kept pace with household spending, and they are less confident about long-term economic stability. According to a recent Pew Charitable Trust <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2015/01/fsm_balance_sheet_report.pdf\">survey</a>, American household incomes fell between 2010 and 2013. Adults in the survey questioned \u201cwhether the American Dream is within reach, and many doubt that their children will fare any better than they have\u201d.<br></p> <p>Earnings for those at the top of the economic food chain have soared. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/17/ceo-pay-ratio-average-worker-afl-cio/\">Analysis</a> by the AFL-CIO union found that chief executive officers of the top 500 companies took home on $12.4m on average \u2013 or 355 times what an average worker makes.<br></p> <p>Yet statistics show the same psychological hurdles to spending exist across income strata. At the high end of the US property market in New York and Miami a glut of residential developments and weak demand is triggering warnings that current pricing is unsustainable and future developments or commercial-to-residential conversions are being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/real-estate-dirty-money-crackdown-property-market-panama-papers-new-york-london-miami\">abandoned.</a><br></p> <p>In the art market, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/11/christies-art-auction-jean-michel-basquiat\">record sales</a> are being achieved but against a backdrop of reduced demand and lower volume of sales than even a year ago.</p> <p>Executives spoke of \u201ctrepidation\u201d and going into sales holding the hands of prospective buyers. \u201cNo one wants to be the last person at the party,\u201d said Christie\u2019s Brett Gorvy.<br></p> <p>Beneath the economics, something else has changed. A contract has been broken. Researchers say neither consumers nor brands are getting much of what they want: consumers don\u2019t want to put their money with brands that don\u2019t speak to their values, while brands aren\u2019t seeing any loyalty from consumers they are trying to cultivate. The apparent contradiction between a healthy economy and unpredictable consumer spending leads some market analysts to the conclusion that consumption as an activity was fundamentally altered by the 2008 recession.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19de1733697d5c8136524838d99954dbc0e285cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19de1733697d5c8136524838d99954dbc0e285cf/0_0_5201_3121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The apparent contradiction between a healthy economy and unpredictable consumer spending leads some market analysts to the conclusion that consumption as an activity was fundamentally altered by the 2008 recession.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The apparent contradiction between a healthy economy and unpredictable consumer spending leads some market analysts to the conclusion that consumption as an activity was fundamentally altered by the 2008 recession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Sullivan/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The abrupt downturn shocked consumers but also placed them firmly in the driving seat when it came to making consumer choices. When you couple this with the power that technology has afforded them to research, learn and compare about their potential purchases, it is little wonder that consumer behavior is changing, analysts say.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had to start looking at the consumer in a completely different way,\u201d says Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at Golden State University. \u201cWe can\u2019t evaluate their confidence and willingness to spend in the ways we used to,\u201d says Yarrow. \u201cConsumers just don\u2019t react the way they did even five years ago. Technology has taken over and they feel more empowered.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Consumers just don\u2019t react the way they did even five years ago.

They\u2019re informed and wary, and determined to be in control.\u201d<br></p> <p>The unpredictability has caused chaos for retailers, which have seen their power over consumers begin to slip away. \u201cTechnology means they can shop however and whenever they want, or they can shop all over the world, and that\u2019s why we see retailers collapsing and relying completely on price reductions,\u201d Yarrow said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s taking retailers forever to realise that when people go shopping they want to see new things all the time. This is what technology has done to our brains. We want a lot more excitement and product turnover in our lives. If we don\u2019t see new product, we won\u2019t go there any more.\u201d<br></p> <p>It\u2019s a trend being observed across the consumer market. The same conscientiousness that exists in the middle market has taken hold at the top end where luxury retailers could once count on injudicious spending to pump up the books. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Yarrow\u2019s research suggests even the one-percenters have adopted middle-class values.
