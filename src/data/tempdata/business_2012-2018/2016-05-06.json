      "bodyText": "The number of oil rigs in use in the US has dropped for the seventh week in a row. The latest Baker Hughes survey showed the rig count fell by 5 to 415 last week, its lowest since October 2009. Brent crude is currently up 1.1% at $45.51, helped by the likely supply problems given the wild fires in Canada. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Worries about the Chinese economy have eased but political risks have increased over the past quarter, according to Oxford Economics: Back with BHS, and more on Dominic Chappell whose consortium owned the UK retailer before it collapsed last month. Simon Goodley reports: [Chappell] was forced out of a previous business venture after taking around \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3315,000) from the company for his personal use. The money, which appears to have been moved without the permission of other shareholders and has never been repaid, was transferred from a start-up company in Spain called Olivia Petroleum, which Chappell fronted and used to bolster his City credentials when he acquired BHS. It is understood that the funds were then diverted into other accounts, including one belonging to Chappell\u2019s wife, as well as being spent at a series of luxury restaurants, hotels and shopping trips, plus a chandlery business that fits out yachts. Chappell is a keen sailor. The allegation about Olivia Petroleum\u2019s finances will raise further questions about the due diligence conducted by the billionaire Sir Philip Green, who sold BHS to Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions for \u00a31 last year and is under mounting pressure to explain his actions. The Serious Fraud Office is also understood to be conducting preliminary inquiries into the activities of Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium leading up to the deal. The full story is here: After being in negative territory for much of the day and falling further after the disappointing US jobs figures, European markets came off their worst levels, inspired by a revival on Wall Street. The US market\u2019s initial falls were reversed as investors ignored yet another sign that the global economy was not in a particularly good place, and instead concentrated on the prospect that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates in the near future. So after a volatile day\u2019s trading the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 8.45 points or 0.14% higher at 6125.70, but its 1.85% fall since Monday marks the worst week since mid-February Germany\u2019s Dax has edged up 0.18% to 9869.95 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.42% lower at 4301.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.45% to 17,842.80 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.15% at 8702.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.69% to 605.61 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 20 points or 0.11%. Here\u2019s a chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing a breakdown of the US jobs: Markets are finding it difficult to untangle the details of the latest US data, says Marcus Bullus, trading director of MB Capital. He said: It has been a tale of two reports, as the markets have struggled to reconcile two conflicting indicators \u2013 slowing rates of job creation and stronger levels of wage growth. The bears have focused on the disappointing headline number, seeing in it a worrying sign of the US economy\u2019s susceptibility to global headwinds. Yet for the bulls, such concerns are cancelled out by the unexpectedly solid rate of wage rises. Increasing average earnings are often viewed as a reliable barometer of corporate confidence, and the initial rush into fixed income that the report triggered has eased, helping US equities end the week on a more positive note. With the prospect of the Fed hiking rates in June now firmly off the table, the markets are being reassured that the benign interest rate environment won\u2019t be changing any time soon. Oil has edged higher ahead of the latest weekly US rig count, with Brent crude 0.8% higher at $45.37. Here\u2019s our report on the US jobs numbers: More pictures from Greece: Away from the US jobs, and ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote in the Greek parliament on pension and tax reforms, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been defending the measures: Earlier came news that consumer confidence in Greece had fallen to a three and a half year low in April. Not exactly a surprise, given the renewed worries about the bailout programme and the contentious tax and pension reforms. The jobs data is lukewarm but not unduly concerning, according to analysts at the CEBR: While some will interpret it negatively, April\u2019s job report represents a lukewarm verdict on the US economy\u2019s current performance. The jobs creation numbers are significantly weaker than expected, but the results on pay growth suggest that the labour market has tightened somewhat. Clearly the pace of hiring has slowed, but this does not necessarily mean a marked cooling of growth in the US, as the details behind the headline number show a more nuanced picture. An economic downturn is typically followed by a long spell of rapid hiring as unemployment or spare capacity in the labour market disappears, a process that is now largely complete. The healthy gains recorded in weekly earnings attest to a market in which workers are beginning to have the upper hand. The participation rate, the unemployment rate, and the number of involuntary unemployed (which all measure spare capacity) have, following sustained improvements during the recovery, changed little since the year\u2019s beginning. In summary, the labour market appears to have stabilised for the time being.... Current indicators show that the services sector expanded in April thanks to a rise in new orders growth. Today\u2019s report demonstrates that the weakness largely pertains to sectors other than services: mining employment fell by 7,000; that in construction and manufacturing showed little change. The sectors making gains were professional and business services, healthcare and financial activities. While a broader sectoral mix would be welcome, this month\u2019s performance shows high-skill services expanding ahead of low-skill occupations such as retail, which made no gains. Consumer confidence, while sagging somewhat at present, should recover assuming wages continue to creep up. There is now little chance of an interest rate hike in June. As it would have been premature in any case, Cebr welcomes this. The US market has unsurprisingly got off to a downbeat start after the worse than expected non-farm payroll numbers. But more surprisingly, it is already off its worst levels, and this is helping to revive European markets. The data was well below forecast, adding to the recent reports from around the globe suggesting the world economy is slowing down. But at the same time it seems to have pushed out the expectations for the timing of the next US rate rise, which is providing some support for shares. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now virtually flat having initially fallen around 61 points. The FTSE 100 is now down just 14 points while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 31 points and France\u2019s Cac 48 points, all well off their lows. Barclays is now expecting just one more US rate rise this year, rather than two, in the wake of the weak jobs data. It is forecasting three rises in 2017. Here are a couple of charts showing the jobs data: More reaction to the worse than expected US jobs figures. We could be in for a tricky few months, said David Morrison of Spread.co: European equities and US stock index futures were already softer ahead of the release but fell further in the immediate aftermath - while the dollar also lost ground. Of course, it\u2019s worth remembering that we\u2019ll have another set of updates on payrolls, manufacturing and services, plus a GDP revision, before the Federal Open Markets Committee meets next month. So we could have a tricky few weeks ahead of us which will be even trickier if Fed members sound off about keeping an open mind on a June hike. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, believes a June hike is unlikely now: The labour market has been a shining beacon compared with other elements of the US economy for the past few months, but no longer. More than 200,000 jobs had been added in five of the previous six months, but today\u2019s figure has come in disappointingly low. An interest rate hike next month is now looking unlikely as the general economic waters are far from calm. Weak growth at home and overseas is a major concern, as is poor manufacturing output, so Janet Yellen and the Fed are expected to keep the interest rate pause button pressed for a little longer. James Smith, economist at ING, says the payrolls report is unlikely to change many minds on the Fed\u2019s rate setting committee about the appropriate timing of the next rise: Although clearly disappointing, this may be more consistent with a gradual slowdown in employment growth as the economy gradually erodes the remaining slack in the labour market. As an aggregate, the labour report was probably best described as a fairly neutral and crucially, is unlikely to change too many minds on the FOMC about the timing of the next rate hike. That said, if we were to start seeing a more rapid, sustained downtrend in employment growth over the next few months, this may provide evidence that weakness emanating from the business investment side of the economy, which tends to lead the economic cycle, is starting to filter through to the more lagging labour market \u2013 at the moment though, it is hard for either the Fed or ourselves to make any conclusions based on one month\u2019s data. Back in the UK, Thomas Cook has responded to the threat of a half-term walkout by its cabin crew over plans to reduce break times. A spokesperson said: We would like to reassure our customers that nothing matters more to us than safety. It\u2019s regrettable the union has chosen this path because the crew rest procedure, which includes monitoring all crew rest on all flights, was introduced with the agreement of the union. It also meets the regulations of industry experts the Civil Aviation Authority and does not compromise on safety. We have offered to meet union representatives and the message we hear directly from our crew is that they\u2019re looking forward to a great summer of flying customers on holiday. The 160,000 non-farm US jobs created in April was way below the average of 232,000 over the last 12 months. Professional and business services created 65,000 jobs in April, higher than the 12-month average. At the other end of the scale, jobs in the mining sector fell by 7,000. Not everyone was surprised by the non-farm payrolls number apparently: Attention will now turn to the Federal Reserve, casting doubt over the central bank\u2019s willingness to raise interests in the face of a softer jobs market. Details of the report from the US Labor Department showed a mixed picture for April. The headline figure of 160,000 was undoubtedly a shocker (202,000 expected), but other elements of the report were in line with expectations. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5%, as expected, and average earnings grew by 0.3%, also as expected. US markets are expected to open lower. Opening call before the US jobs report was published: The 160,000 non-farm jobs created in April was the smallest in seven months. Falls in European markets have accelerated since the jobs report was published: FTSE 100: -1% at 6,055.97 German DAX: -1.1% at 9,741.37 French CAC: -1.4% at 4,258.29 Spanish IBEX: -1.2% at 8,588.5 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.8% at 17,601.82 Breaking: US non-farm payrolls dropped sharply in April, to 160,000 from 208,000 in March. This is a large downside shock. Economists were expecting 202,000. The March figure was revised down from an initial estimate of 215,000 jobs. Reaction to follow. Almost time for US payrolls. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting the report to show that non-farm payrolls increased by 202,000 in April, lower than March\u2019s 215,00. Just under 10 minutes to go. Thomas Cook cabin crew are voting on possible strike action during the half-term holiday in May. The dispute centres on proposed changes to the length of breaks staff will be allowed to take. Cabin crew will be allowed one 20-minute break over a 12-hour shift, according to Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union. More than 1,000 cabin crew have begun voting in a ballot for industrial action. The union said staff were previously entitled to a 20-minute break every six hours and that the proposed changes would put passenger safety at risk. Read our full story here. Leicester City\u2019s incredible Premier League title win has already put the East Midlands city on the tourist map. Days after claiming the title for the first time in the club\u2019s history, visitors are planning to descend on the city in droves this weekend according to Trivago, the hotel search website. Searches for a hotel stay in Leicester for the coming weekend jumped 277% since the win (compared with the week before). The average stay required was one night. Leicester will receive the trophy after their final home game of the season against Everton on Saturday. A hotel room in the city on Saturday night will cost you an average \u00a3128, up 49% from the May monthly average of \u00a386. Room availability for this Saturday is just 4%. In a sign that heightened interest is not limited to this weekend alone, hotel searches for all future travel to Leicester increased by 195%. Trivago\u2019s Denise Bartlett: With much buzz surrounding Leicester\u2019s inconceivable Premier League victory, it is unsurprising to see a last-minute surge in hotel searches to the city. The average stay duration of one night suggests that fans have either managed to obtain last-minute tickets, or simply want to soak up the atmosphere and celebrate. The increase in travel interest for a hotel stay in the future, however, suggests that Leicester\u2019s tourism industry may be able to experience more long-term benefits from the media exposure.\u201d Tensions are already running high in Athens as Greeks take to the streets at the beginning of a three-day general strike. A strike was already planned for Sunday, to coincide with a parliamentary vote on tax and pension reforms, but unions called on Thursday for the strike to be extended to Friday and Saturday. The austerity measures are part of a package reforms that are being proposed in return for more bailout money from Greece\u2019s lenders. Workers from the Greek shipping industry, civil service, and public transport sector are among those taking part in the strike. Greece\u2019s largest labour union, the private sector GSEE, said the proposed reforms were the \u201clast nail in the coffin\u201d for workers and pensioners who have already suffered six years of austerity. A GSEE spokesperson said: They are trying to prove to the Eurogroup that they are good students but the y are destroying Greece\u2019s social security system. Christine Lagarde is losing patience with eurozone finance ministers. The head of the International Monetary Fund has written to all 19 of them urging them to immediately start talks on providing debt relief for Greece, or risk losing the support of the IMF for a Greek package. In the letter - seen by the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel - Lagarde writes: We believe that specific [economic reform] measures, debt restructuring, and financing must now be discussed contemporaneously. For us to support Greece with a new IMF arrangement, it is essential that the financing and debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners are based on fiscal targets that are realistic because they are supported by credible measures to reach them. Lagarde issued the warning as talks between Greece and its eurozone partners on a package of reforms appear to have stalled. Last month, finance ministers told Athens they wanted to see \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.4bn) of specific contingency reforms in place - as an insurance policy in the event that main reform measures did not go far enough to allow Greece to make its repayments - before releasing more funds. But no agreement has been reached on contingencies, and the IMF wants debt relief to be included in the talks immediately. European markets are still down ahead of the US payrolls... Some upbeat figures from Spain earlier. Industrial production rose 1.2% in March, rebounding from a 0.3% drop in February and the best performance since 2014. It was much better than expected - economists had forecast a smaller 0.3% increase. On an annual basis, industrial output increased 2.8% in March. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, says this morning\u2019s car figures show resilience but there are also signs that consumers are becoming concerned about the economic outlook: New car sales were pretty resilient in April, in contrast to the weakened performance seen in many other sectors of the economy. A modest dip in private sector car sales may well be the consequence of consumers becoming more wary about buying big ticket items due to increased concerns over the economic outlook and a recent dilution of purchasing power compared to the peak levels of 2015. Over the longer term, much will obviously depend on how earnings growth develops, given that employers have been using prolonged negligible inflation as a reason to award modest pay increases. Also important is whether the labour market can regain momentum after the EU referendum. The best-selling cars in the UK in April: New car sales rose again in April, up 2% compared with a year earlier. A total of 189,505 new cars were sold last month - the largest number for the month of April in 13 years according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The increase was driven by fleet and business sales, up 6.1% and 2.8% respectively. Sales to individuals however fell 2.5%. It followed a very strong March, when 518,000 new cars were registered, making it the second-biggest month on record. April\u2019s numbers take the total number of new cars sold in 2016 so far to 961,285, 4.4% ahead of this time last year. Mike Hawes, SMMT\u2019s chief executive, reiterated his point that greater-than-usual uncertainty lies ahead for the car market in the months ahead, as the UK goes to the polls on EU membership. After such a strong March, April\u2019s steadier performance was to be anticipated, and is in line with our expectations for the year. Consumer confidence remains high as buyers continue to capitalise on attractive finance deals, although this could be affected by political and economic uncertainty in the coming months. Sir Philip Green, the billionaire former owner of BHS, has called for the resignation of MP Frank Field as head of the parliamentary investigation into the retailer\u2019s demise. The entrepreneur has accused Field of being \u201cprejudiced\u201d against him. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 a year ago to a group of little-known investors. Last week the retail chain collapsed into administration putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving the company with a \u00a3571m pensions black hole. As chairman of the work and pensions committee, Field is leading the parliamentary inquiry (due to begin on Monday) into what went wrong at BHS. Field told the Financial Times on Thursday that Green should \u201cmake good\u201d the pension scheme by paying off the deficit, or lose his knighthood: I feel that Philip Green has a moral duty to make good the pension scheme and if he doesn\u2019t, while I can\u2019t speak for the committee as a whole, I personally would recommend he should lose his knighthood. Sir Philip is a master of bullying but he will find that parliament isn\u2019t for being bullied. Green described the comments as an \u201coutrageous outburst\u201d and called for Field to step down: Clearly he has made his decision as to what he feels the punishment should be without even hearing any evidence from anybody about BHS or the circumstances of the last 15 years. I think Mr Field needs to stand down from the inquiry immediately as he is clearly prejudiced. Read our full story on the row here. Investors are particularly nervous about the US payrolls report today following other worrying signals that the labour market is weakening in the world\u2019s largest economy. A study published on Thursday showed the number of US workers laid off last month jumped, hitting the highest level for an April in seven years. Meanwhile the US Labor Department said the number of Americans making new claims for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 to 274,000 last week - the largest increase since February last year. Economists had forecast a smaller number of around 260,000. Oil prices are also falling this morning. Brent crude oil is down 0.5% at $44.77 a barrel. The cautious sentiment has spread to Europe, with markets opening lower across the board this morning. The FTSE 100 is down 0.7% at 6,076. Germany\u2019s DAX is down 0.5%, the French CAC is down 0.7%. In Spain the IBEX is down 0.4%, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 0.2%. Shares in Asia have fallen, hitting one-month lows as fears over the US jobs recovery and the wider economy take their toll. Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management\u201d Recent global economic data and some corporate earnings from major Western firms have been lackluster, leading to risk-off trading in markets. Japan\u2019s Nikkei Index fell 0.25%. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.2%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was down 1.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news item on the agenda today is the US payrolls report for April, published at 13.30 UK time. Economists and investors are nervous about this one. The headline non-farm payrolls figure is expected to show 202,000 jobs were created in April, fewer than the 215,000 created in March. A softer US jobs market would only add to fears of a wider slowdown, and investors are fearful that the number today could be even lower, as Michael Hewson from CMC Markets explains: Expectations around today\u2019s number are for 200k new jobs to be added for April, down from 215k in March, which would be more in line with the better than expected ISM non-manufacturing report which came out on Wednesday. That saw a decent rise in the employment component, with the unemployment rate remaining steady at 5%, but there does appear to be an undercurrent of concern that suggests we could see a miss to the downside. European markets are on course to end the week down for a second week, as concerns persists over the state of the global economy. Markets are expected to open lower:",

The jobs creation numbers are significantly weaker than expected, but the results on pay growth suggest that the labour market has tightened somewhat. Clearly the pace of hiring has slowed, but this does not necessarily mean a marked cooling of growth in the US, as the details behind the headline number show a more nuanced picture.</p> <p>An economic downturn is typically followed by a long spell of rapid hiring as unemployment or spare capacity in the labour market disappears, a process that is now largely complete. The healthy gains recorded in weekly earnings attest to a market in which workers are beginning to have the upper hand. The participation rate, the unemployment rate, and the number of involuntary unemployed (which all measure spare capacity) have, following sustained improvements during the recovery, changed little since the year\u2019s beginning. In summary, the labour market appears to have stabilised for the time being....</p> <p>Current indicators show that the services sector expanded in April thanks to a rise in new orders growth. Today\u2019s report demonstrates that the weakness largely pertains to sectors other than services: mining employment fell by 7,000; that in construction and manufacturing showed little change. The sectors making gains were professional and business services, healthcare and financial activities. While a broader sectoral mix would be welcome, this month\u2019s performance shows high-skill services expanding ahead of low-skill occupations such as retail, which made no gains. Consumer confidence, while sagging somewhat at present, should recover assuming wages continue to creep up.</p> <p>There is now little chance of an interest rate hike in June. As it would have been premature in any case, Cebr welcomes this.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-572c9e74e4b00455bdea4057\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-06T13:44:45.836Z\">2.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens sharply lower but quickly recovers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US market has unsurprisingly got off to a downbeat start after the worse than expected non-farm payroll numbers.

      "bodyText": "They call it the \u201cexperience economy\u201d: a huge shift in consumer behaviour is said to be under way, from buying things to doing things. The demise of high street stalwarts BHS and Austin Reed, poor retail spending figures and a downturn in the number of people visiting high streets and shopping centres, are all being held up as evidence that Britons\u2019 priorities are changing. Earlier this year a senior Ikea executive warned that the appetite of western consumers to own ever more goods and chattels was probably waning. \u201cIn the west\u201d, he warned, \u201cwe have probably hit peak stuff.\u201d Now retailers ranging from fashion to food chains are making similar observations, because official data shows that households are spending less on clothes and food but more on holidays, cars, entertainment and eating out. Spending on gadgets that keep people connected to the internet is also on the rise. \u201cWe increasingly see a trend for consumers to spend more on experiences rather than on products,\u201d said Kevin Jenkins, the UK and Ireland managing director of payment card group Visa Europe. \u201cEating out, booking holidays and discovering new experiences are all driving spending growth at a time when the lower cost of living is creating higher disposable incomes.\u201d There are six areas where spending is growing and this is what they tell us about the changing way we shop: Cars The number of new cars registered in April hit its highest level for 13 years, continuing a rising trend, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The UK\u2019s rock-bottom borrowing costs are a key factor here. But there has also been a huge switch in the UK away from buying cars outright to leasing and buying on credit. It is estimated that four in five new cars are bought on credit \u2013 a trend powered by low interest rates. Recreation Rising employment, near-zero inflation and low interest rates have boosted household budgets. Food prices have fallen amid a supermarket price war, cheap oil has helped knock back petrol prices and the rise of discount retailers has cut the cost of clothes. All that leaves more money for non-essentials. Average household weekly spending on clothes and food has fallen since 2010 while spending on recreation and culture has risen, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The most recent increase in spending on this category was driven by extra spending on computers, garden plants and sports admissions. Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence at trend forecaster WGSN, says such patterns reflect changing priorities. \u201cPeople are interested in servicing a lifestyle rather than buying stuff.\u201d She predicts the trend will continue because younger people have a different attitude to owning things to their parents, partly because they are less likely to be home owners, wanting to feather their nest. They have also grown up with the idea of renting or subscribing to services like iTunes or Spotify. Just as spending on tablets has risen, so has spending on connecting devices to the internet. The ONS says spending on communication has been on the up since 2002, partly because of a rise in what we splash out on mobile phones \u2013 both on new handsets and contract payments. Holidays One sign that experiences are trumping things, is the rise in holiday travel. Official tourism figures show the number of trips taken for fun or to visit family and friends has increased sharply since 2010. As Sainsburys revealed a drop in profits this week, its chief executive, Mike Coupe, said shoppers had more money in their pockets but were spending it largely on holidays and new cars. Eating out Year-on-year spending growth by sector Spending on hotels, bars and restaurants has been growing several times faster than overall spending in the past year, according to Visa Europe. Its latest figures showed a year-on-year rise of 5.3% for spending on that category, while spending on clothes and shoes fell. Last week Next\u2019s chief executive, Lord Wolfson, said there was a shift in consumer spending away from clothing and towards other priorities such as eating out, housing and cars, but he reckoned \u2013 or maybe was hoping \u2013 the shift would not be permanent. Online shopping One experience that seems to have fallen out of fashion is the shopping trip. Once a very British pastime, family trips to the mall are being replaced by online shopping and trips to retail parks \u2013 but that face-to-face shopping is often just to pick up \u201cclick and collect\u201d items ordered online. This rise of online shopping, increasingly done on the go from mobile phones, has led to a sharp increase in demand for delivery services. The number of vans on Britain\u2019s roads has hit an all-time highand industry insiders suggest there are about 40,000 delivery drivers fronting a battle between retailers competing to offer the fastest and cheapest deliveries.",

Spending on gadgets that keep people connected to the internet is also on the rise.</p> <p>\u201cWe increasingly see a trend for consumers to spend more on experiences rather than on products,\u201d said Kevin Jenkins, the UK and Ireland managing director of payment card group Visa Europe.<br></p> <p>\u201cEating out, booking holidays and discovering new experiences are all driving spending growth at a time when the lower cost of living is creating higher disposable incomes.\u201d</p> <p>There are six areas where spending is growing and this is what they tell us about the changing way we shop:<br></p> <h2>Cars</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-06T10:52:37/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Car registrations\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-06T10:52:37/embed.html\">Car registrations</a> <figcaption>Car registrations.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/uk-car-registrations-highest-level-13-years\">number of new cars registered in April hit its highest level for 13 years</a>, continuing a rising trend, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. </p> <p>The UK\u2019s rock-bottom borrowing costs are a key factor here. But there has also been a huge switch in the UK away from buying cars outright to leasing and buying on credit. It is estimated that four in five new cars are bought on credit \u2013 a trend powered by low interest rates.</p> <h2>Recreation</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-06T10:15:32/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Spending on recreation and culture\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-06T10:15:32/embed.html\">Spending on recreation and culture</a> </figure>  <p>Rising employment, near-zero inflation and low interest rates have boosted household budgets. Food prices have fallen amid a supermarket price war, cheap oil has helped knock back petrol prices and the rise of discount retailers has cut the cost of clothes. All that leaves more money for non-essentials.</p> <p>Average household weekly spending on clothes and food has fallen since 2010 while spending on recreation and culture has risen, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The most recent increase in spending on this category was driven by extra spending on computers, garden plants and sports admissions.</p> <p>Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence at trend forecaster WGSN, says such patterns reflect changing priorities. \u201cPeople are interested in servicing a lifestyle rather than buying stuff.\u201d </p> <p>She predicts the trend will continue because younger people have a different attitude to owning things to their parents, partly because they are less likely to be home owners, wanting to feather their nest. They have also grown up with the idea of renting or subscribing to services like iTunes or Spotify.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-06T10:53:49/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Spending on communications\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-06T10:53:49/embed.html\">Spending on communications</a> </figure>  <p>Just as spending on tablets has risen, so has spending on connecting devices to the internet.

      "bodyText": "The government has been accused of burying bad news during an election period after publishing a report (pdf) saying an emergency scheme to keep the lights on could add \u00a338 a year to each household bill. The cash is going towards the cost of a \u201ccapacity market\u201d scheme, under which energy companies have been paid to keep their power stations on standby for times of peak demand. A new capacity market auction is planned by the government for next year, following two already held, and the impact assessment report suggests that the cost could be as much as \u00a33bn in 2018, or \u00a338 per household. The government has previously slashed subsidies for wind and solar projects on the grounds that they were driving up consumer bills, but it said the latest initiative would guarantee electricity needs for 2017-18, while protecting against price spikes by securing electricity in advance. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy and Climate Change said: \u201cOur top priority is ensuring that families and businesses have a secure, affordable, clean energy supply, which they can rely on now and into the future.\u201d DECC argues that the \u00a338 figure is a gross one that should be more than compensated for by the rise in overall power prices that would otherwise occur if the capacity market payments were not made. \u201cIf only the announced plant closures occur, we estimate the net impact on bills to be between \u00a310 and \u00a321, depending on the clearing price in the auction,\u201d the spokesperson said. But Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said the capacity market scheme was a \u201cmassive waste of money\u201d because previous payments ended up going to nuclear facilities and other plants that would have stayed open regardless. \u201cThe Tories are trying to bury this bad news. Every family\u2019s energy bill is to shoot up to pay for these gross new handouts to the big energy companies,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been so badly designed, it isn\u2019t getting new power stations built, but instead is just lining the pockets of the big six and investors in highly polluting diesel generators.\u201d Catherine Mitchell, a professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, said the scheme highlighted the shortsighted nature of energy policies. \u201cThe capacity market system inherently favours fossil fuel generation, damaging the environment while delaying the widespread rollout of a flexible grid based on renewables, demand management, storage, interconnection and more efficient practices, as the national infrastructure commission and Energy UK have recently recommended,\u201d she said. Independent energy consultants also expressed concern. David Oliver, a senior consultant at Inenco, said the impact of the latest proposals could not be easily predicted. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether these changes will ultimately help secure the much-needed investment in new generation to justify the additional cost to homes and businesses,\u201d he said. Energy companies have been closing coal, gas and other power stations because they say wholesale power prices are so low that it is not commercially viable to keep them open.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, whose consortium owned BHS before it collapsed last month, was forced out of a previous business venture after taking around \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3315,000) from the company for his personal use. The money, which appears to have been moved without the permission of other shareholders and has never been repaid, was transferred from a start-up company in Spain called Olivia Petroleum, which Chappell fronted and used to bolster his City credentials when he acquired BHS. It is understood that the funds were then diverted into other accounts, including one belonging to Chappell\u2019s wife, as well as being spent at a series of luxury restaurants, hotels and shopping trips, plus a chandlery business that fits out yachts. Chappell is a keen sailor. The allegation about Olivia Petroleum\u2019s finances will raise further questions about the due diligence conducted by the billionaire Sir Philip Green, who sold BHS to Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions for \u00a31 last year and is under mounting pressure to explain his actions. The Serious Fraud Office is also understood to be conducting preliminary inquiries into the activities of Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium leading up to the deal. Just 13 months after the sale, BHS collapsed into administration leaving 11,000 jobs at risk and the company pension fund in deficit to the tune of \u00a3571m. The Guardian revealed last month that more than \u00a325m was paid out from BHS to its owner, Retail Acquisitions, in the period between the department store\u2019s sale and it falling into administration. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. Between 2009 and 2012, Chappell fronted Olivia Petroleum, in which he held a 40% stake. The remainder of the company was owned by private investors, who are understood to have ousted him from the firm in 2012 by diluting Chappell\u2019s shareholding. Internal documents show that the move followed the discovery of the missing funds. Company sources present at the time have confirmed that the money was moved personally by Chappell, while the Guardian has seen contemporaneous internal Olivia paperwork that backs up the testimonies. One email, sent by a lawyer acting for Olivia Petroleum in November 2011, stated: \u201cThere is an awful amount of money spent in travel, restaurants, shopping and UK, which indicates that this could be considered as hidden salaries of payment in species to employees. Big liability here. The company is not trading and this is not in accordance with that.\u201d Another internal email, sent by a different source, said: \u201cIn our due diligence we discovered fraud and malfeasance in the Spanish company.\u201d Chappell told the Guardian that the notion that large amounts of money were taken from the company for his personal use was \u201ctotally untrue\u201d, before adding that the monies he received from Olivia Petroleum amounted to \u201cunder \u20ac200,000. That was my salary. That\u2019s what I drew from the company.\u201d He later changed his story and said he had not drawn a salary but had taken \u201ca directors\u2019 loan\u201d amounting to \u201c\u20ac212,000, I think\u201d. He also said: \u201cI still own a significant amount of it [Olivia Petroleum]\u201d, before saying he had sold his stake. Olivia Petroleum was set up to acquire and develop an oil storage facility called Istamelsa in Cadiz, on Spain\u2019s south-western coast, but the Guardian understands that the project was never completed. Istamelsa remains in administration as it has yet to settle outstanding tax affairs. Chappell describes himself as the chief executive of Olivia Petroleum SA between January 2009 and November 2012 on the professional networking website LinkedIn. When he acquired BHS, the Sunday Times quoted Chappell as saying he had made a \u201cbonanza\u201d from an oil storage facility in Cadiz, which he ploughed into BHS. Meanwhile, Chappell also gave his advisers the name of Olivia Petroleum when they asked for examples of his experience in turning struggling companies around, which was used to counter criticisms that he had no relevant experience. When Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions acquired BHS, numerous media outlets reported that Chappell\u2019s consortium included the \u201coil distribution firm Olivia Petroleum\u201d. The reports of Olivia\u2019s involvement in the consortium were erroneous, but they remained uncorrected. This week, Chappell told the Guardian that the money he put into BHS had been made through \u201cOlivia Investments, which is my company [and] is an oil and gas trading company in Gibraltar. It has got nothing to do with the installation of Istamelsa.\u201d On being pressed he said he had made money from a different oil storage facility in Cadiz, which he refused to name, as well as through a different Olivia Petroleum, the second one being based in Gibraltar. The fluid story of Olivia Petroleum will be doubly concerning for BHS\u2019s 11,000 staff, considering the press coverage already given to Chappell\u2019s historic businesses and connections. Chappell, who has twice been declared bankrupt, had previously been in business with Paul Sutton, who had separately been convicted of embezzlement in France in 2002 and was originally a key player on Chappell\u2019s bid for BHS. However, once Green was sent a dossier detailing Sutton\u2019s past, Sutton was forced to sign a statutory declaration promising he was not involved in the purchase. Chappell has said he first met Sutton in around 2006 when Sutton briefly tried to buy property from him. He told the Guardian in April last year: \u201cI\u2019m nothing to do with Paul Sutton. I\u2019m not associated with him.\u201d Before BHS\u2019s administration, Green had attempted to distance himself from any wreckage by stating: \u201cIf I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you\u2019re a great driver and you crash it into the first fucking mountain, is that my fault?\u201d",

The Serious Fraud Office is also <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/04/mps-examining-bhs-collapse-offer-cooperate-investigators\">understood to be conducting preliminary inquiries</a> into the activities of Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium leading up to the deal. </p> <p>Just 13 months after the sale, BHS collapsed into administration leaving 11,000 jobs at risk and the company pension fund in deficit to the tune of \u00a3571m. The Guardian revealed last month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-owner-retail-acquisitions-25m-administration\">more than \u00a325m was paid out from BHS to its owner, Retail Acquisitions</a>, in the period between the department store\u2019s sale and it falling into administration. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments.</p> <p>Between 2009 and 2012, Chappell fronted Olivia Petroleum, in which he held a 40% stake. The remainder of the company was owned by private investors, who are understood to have ousted him from the firm in 2012 by diluting Chappell\u2019s shareholding. Internal documents show that the move followed the discovery of the missing funds.</p> <p>Company sources present at the time have confirmed that the money was moved personally by Chappell, while the Guardian has seen contemporaneous internal Olivia paperwork that backs up the testimonies.</p> <p>One email, sent by a lawyer acting for Olivia Petroleum in November 2011, stated: \u201cThere is an awful amount of money spent in travel, restaurants, shopping and UK, which indicates that this could be considered as hidden salaries of payment in species to employees. Big liability here. The company is not trading and this is not in accordance with that.\u201d</p> <p>Another internal email, sent by a different source, said: \u201cIn our due diligence we discovered fraud and malfeasance in the Spanish company.\u201d</p> <p>Chappell told the Guardian that the notion that large amounts of money were taken from the company for his personal use was \u201ctotally untrue\u201d, before adding that the monies he received from Olivia Petroleum amounted to \u201cunder \u20ac200,000. That was my salary. That\u2019s what I drew from the company.\u201d He later changed his story and said he had not drawn a salary but had taken \u201ca directors\u2019 loan\u201d amounting to \u201c\u20ac212,000, I think\u201d.</p> <p>He also said: \u201cI still own a significant amount of it [Olivia Petroleum]\u201d, before saying he had sold his stake.</p> <p>Olivia Petroleum was set up to acquire and develop an oil storage facility called Istamelsa in Cadiz, on Spain\u2019s south-western coast, but the Guardian understands that the project was never completed. Istamelsa remains in administration as it has yet to settle outstanding tax affairs.</p> <p>Chappell describes himself as the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-chappell-14628167?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=n8lU&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A236558214%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1462366243147%2Ctas%3Adominic%20chappel\">chief executive of Olivia Petroleum SA between January 2009 and November 2012</a> on the professional networking website LinkedIn. When he acquired BHS, the Sunday Times quoted Chappell as saying he had made a \u201cbonanza\u201d from an oil storage facility in Cadiz, which he ploughed into BHS.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chappell also gave his advisers the name of Olivia Petroleum when they asked for examples of his experience in turning struggling companies around, which was used to counter criticisms that he had no relevant experience. When Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions acquired BHS, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/#q=%22Spanish+turnaround+and+oil+distribution+firm+Olivia+Petroleum%22&amp;gws_rd=cr\">numerous media outlets reported that Chappell\u2019s consortium included the \u201coil distribution firm Olivia Petroleum\u201d</a>. The reports of Olivia\u2019s involvement in the consortium were erroneous, but they remained uncorrected.</p> <p>This week, Chappell told the Guardian that the money he put into BHS had been made through \u201cOlivia Investments, which is my company [and] is an oil and gas trading company in Gibraltar. It has got nothing to do with the installation of Istamelsa.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>On being pressed he said he had made money from a different oil storage facility in Cadiz, which he refused to name, as well as through a different Olivia Petroleum, the second one being based in Gibraltar.</p> <p>The fluid story of Olivia Petroleum will be doubly concerning for BHS\u2019s 11,000 staff, considering the press coverage already given to Chappell\u2019s historic businesses and connections.</p> <p>Chappell, who has twice been declared bankrupt, had previously been in business with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/dominic-chappell-and-the-bhs-takeover-that-worried-retail-watchers\">Paul Sutton</a>, who had separately been convicted of embezzlement in France in 2002 and was originally a key player on Chappell\u2019s bid for BHS. However, once Green was sent a dossier detailing Sutton\u2019s past, Sutton was <a href=\"https://next.ft.com/content/c577f4c2-df95-11e4-a06a-00144feab7de\">forced to sign a statutory declaration promising he was not involved in the purchase</a>.</p> <p>Chappell has said he first met Sutton in around 2006 when Sutton briefly tried to buy property from him. He told the Guardian in April last year: \u201cI\u2019m nothing to do with Paul Sutton. I\u2019m not associated with him.\u201d</p> <p>Before BHS\u2019s administration, Green had attempted to distance himself from any wreckage by stating: \u201cIf I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you\u2019re a great driver and you crash it into the first fucking mountain, is that my fault?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons\u2019 chief executive, David Potts, has been handed a \u00a31m bonus after the supermarket chain bounced back to profitability and improved sales. The former Tesco executive, who took the helm at Morrisons in March last year, more than doubled his total earnings to \u00a32.25m with the \u00a31.09m bonus, half of which is paid in shares that do not vest for three years. It came on top of \u00a3747,000 in salary, a \u00a3200,000 relocation support package and \u00a326,000 of other benefits including a car allowance. He also got \u00a3187,000 in lieu of a pension. The pay package is slightly more than his predecessor Dalton Philips who earned \u00a32.1m in the year to March 2015 and a \u00a31.1m payoff when he was sacked after a slump in sales and profits. Potts was also granted \u00a32.6m in long-term share awards, equivalent to three times his salary, which he could collect in February 2018 if he meets cash flow, profits and sales targets. The pay deal potentially sets Morrisons up for another confrontation with shareholders at its annual shareholder meeting in June after more than a third of shareholders, an unusually high number, voted against the supermarket\u2019s remuneration report last year. Potts has not taken a pay rise for the coming year \u2013 with a basic salary of \u00a3850,000. He could earn up to double his salary again in annual bonus and up to 2.4 times his salary in long-term share awards subject to a three-year performance targets \u2013 a total package of more than \u00a34m. Trevor Strain, Morrisons\u2019 finance director, was given a \u00a350,000 rise in basic salary to \u00a3575,000. Directors\u2019 chunky renumeration packages were revealed after staff were given an average 20% rise in their basic rate of pay to \u00a38.20 an hour this year \u2013 a \u00a31 more than the government\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d, a new minimum wage for the over-25s. But some of that increase was offset by changes to benefits \u2013 including the end of extra pay for Sundays and paid breaks. Morrisons is battling to secure its place on the high street against rising competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl and heavy price cutting by rivals Tesco and Asda. Total sales for the year to 31 January fell 4.1% to \u00a316.1bn after the group closed a net total of 20 stores. The Bradford-based supermarket chain revealed a pre-tax profit of \u00a3217m after a \u00a3792m loss in the previous 12 months, when it was forced to close stores as sales slumped in the face of heavy competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. But underlying profits which strip out the impact of one-off writedowns, restructuring costs and profits from the sale of unwanted properties \u2013 decreased almost 27% to \u00a3302m, slightly lower than the \u00a3308m analysts had expected.",

      "bodyText": "The US economy showed further signs of a slowdown on Friday as the US Department of Labor announced just 160,000 new jobs had been created in April, 40,000 fewer than had been expected. The US unemployment rate remained steady at 5%. Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected the economy to add 202,000 jobs. February and March job gains were revised down, with the US economy now estimated to have added 19,000 jobs fewer than originally thought. Over the last 12 months, employment growth averaged 232,000 jobs per month. April\u2019s job gains were the lowest in seven months. The weaker-than-expected job growth could lead the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates in June. US labor participation also dropped to 62.8% in April, down from 63% in March. \u201cIn general this indicator has been on the rise, and hopefully this is just a one-month blip,\u201d said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cRising labor force participation is a sign that more people are getting off the sidelines and starting to look for work.\u201d The number of people who wanted to work full time but could only find part-time work dropped below six million. Additionally, among the major groups of workers, the unemployment rate for Hispanics increased to 6.1% in April. Friday\u2019s jobs report comes after a week of disappointing news. Last week, the US Department of Commerce reported that in the first quarter of 2016 the US economy grew at the slowest pace in two years. On Wednesday, figures from the payroll company ADP showed private sector employers added just 156,000 jobs in April. According to another report by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas \u2013 an outplacement consultant \u2013 released this week, US companies laid off 61,582 people between 1 and 30 April, a seven-year high. April\u2019s layoffs included jobs lost in the oil industry and more than 10,000 jobs cut by Intel, the California-based technology company. Mining employment continued to decline in April, dropping by about 7,000 jobs. Since reaching a peak in September 2014, employment in mining has decreased by 191,000. With continuous job losses in the manufacturing sector and election uncertainty intensifying, \u201cit would be surprising if the hiring trend didn\u2019t slow further in coming months\u201d, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. The 35% surge in layoffs from March to April is not necessarily a sign of a weakening economy, according to John Challenger, the chief executive officer of Challenger Gray &amp; Christmas. \u201cIt is not unusual to see heavy job cuts in a strong economy. Companies are constantly retooling, and sometimes the best time to do that is when the economy is strong,\u201d he said. Another report released on Thursday by the US Department of Labor found that jobless claims climbed to 274,000 in the last week of April \u2013 up 17,000 from the week before. The four-week average, however, \u201cwas a still-low 258,000\u201d, pointed out Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, an economic analysis company. Friday\u2019s disappointing report will be read as evidence of slowing following the weakness in GDP, \u201clessening the case for Fed tightening\u201d, according to O\u2019Sullivan. Before the jobs report was released, the St Louis Federal Reserve president, James Bullard, appeared bullish about the US job market. The US labor market is \u201cat or possibly well beyond reasonable conceptions of full employment\u201d, he said on Thursday. Full employment is when the labor market no longer shows signs of cyclical weakness and most people who are willing and looking for work are able to find a job. Bullard is a voting member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking committee. Last month, for the third time this year, the committee decided to hold off raising interest rates. US interest rates have remained unchanged in the 0.25% to 0.5% range since December, when the Fed raised rates from near zero for the first time in almost a decade. The global pressures that have kept the Fed from raising interest rates \u201cappear to be waning during the first half of 2016\u201d, Bullard said on Thursday, implying that the Fed might be open to raising rates in June. This now seems in doubt. Among the data that the Fed will consider before making its decision will be revised GDP figures, which are to be released at the end of May, and both the April and May job reports. There is, however, one more thing that could prevent the Fed from raising rates in June: the UK\u2019s vote on whether it will leave the European Union, which is due to take place about a week after Fed\u2019s June meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot better information by the middle of June about Brexit and what polls show and how the markets are reacting,\u201d the San Francisco Fed president, John Williams, told reporters on Thursday. Williams is not a voting member of the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee. \u201cClearly if there\u2019s an expectation that it actually will pass and the markets will react to that then we have to take that into consideration in terms of how it affects the US economy and the outlook.\u201d According to Gould, there is \u201cno incentive\u201d for an interest rate hike in the near future. One of the main reasons why she believes the Fed should hold off on raising interest rates is to allow US wages to grow. Average hourly earnings went up by eight cents in April. Over the past year, earnings rose by just 2.5%. \u201cMost observers believe that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates in June \u2013 given that wage growth is below any reasonable target, this is a prudent move,\u201d she said. \u201cWorking people and their families are keenly aware of the fact that strong wage growth continues to be the lagging indicator in this recovery.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook cabin crew are voting on possible strike action during the May half-term school holiday in a dispute over health and safety after changes to their rest breaks. Cabin crew will be allowed one 20-minute break over 12 hours, according to Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union, and more than 1,000 cabin crew have begun voting in a ballot for industrial action. Unite said there were mounting concerns that cabin crew were being pushed to the limit in an attempt to maximise profits, putting passenger safety at risk. It accused the travel company of a \u201crepeated refusal to agree to talks and reach a sensible negotiated solution\u201d. A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: \u201cWe would like to reassure our customers that nothing matters more to us than safety. It\u2019s regrettable the union has chosen this path because the crew rest procedure, which includes monitoring all crew rest on all flights, was introduced with the agreement of the union. It also meets the regulations of industry experts the Civil Aviation Authority and does not compromise on safety. \u201cWe have offered to meet union representatives and the message we hear directly from our crew is that they\u2019re looking forward to a great summer of flying customers on holiday.\u201d The ballot of staff who work on flights to popular tourist destinations from 10 airports across the UK closes on 25 May, and could lead to industrial action taking place during half term. Cabin crew typically work shifts of 10-15 hours and up to 60 hours a week. Shifts include pre-flight preparations, safety and security checks, boarding, inflight service of headsets, drinks, food, duty-free sales and other promotions. The union said staff were previously entitled to a 20-minute break every six hours. Thomas Cook has introduced an Airshoppen service. This additional inflight service allows passengers to order goods online before their flights and have them delivered to their seats. It involves cabin crew sorting and bagging orders before takeoff and collecting payment during the flight. The service could take up to two hours to deliver, Unite said. The union\u2019s national officer, Oliver Richardson, said: \u201cOur members are deeply concerned about the impact these changes to rest breaks are having on inflight safety. Fatigue is a major contributory factor to accidents and slower response times when there is an incident. \u201cThe primary purpose of cabin crew is the safety of passengers, but instead Thomas Cook seems intent on working them to the bone to extract as much money as possible out of passengers at the expense of safety.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, has called in two of Sir Philip Green\u2019s bitterest former rivals to assist the parliamentary investigation into the collapse of BHS. Sir David Norgrove, who as chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s pension fund was instrumental in scuppering Green\u2019s attempted bid for the retailer in 2004, has been appointed special adviser. Lord Myners, who also fought off Green\u2019s bid as chairman of M&amp;S between 2004 and 2006 when the former BHS owner attempted a \u00a310bn takeover of the high street stalwart, has been appointed to lead a panel of financial assessors for the committee. Myners has already filed 11 questions in the House of Lords calling on the government to investigate the demise of BHS. The appointments are likely to further ratchet up the dispute between Field and Green which kicked off on Thursday, when the MP suggested the former BHS owner should be stripped of his knighthood if he did not put up funds to pay off the ailing retailer\u2019s \u00a3571m pension fund deficit. He told the Financial Times: \u201cIf someone rats on the commitment he made to his workforce, we would want to reconsider whether honours are still appropriate.\u201d Green then called for Field\u2019s resignation, suggesting the MP was \u201cprejudiced\u201d against him. Green has agreed to appear before a special joint session of the work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee who are both investigating the demise of BHS. The retail chain, which Green sold for \u00a31 to a little-known group of investors a year ago, collapsed into administration last week putting 11,000 jobs at risk and the pensioners in the hands of the government\u2019s pension protection fund. Green said in a statement that he was horrified by Field\u2019s \u201coutrageous outburst\u201d. The tycoon added: \u201cClearly he has made his decision as to what he feels the punishment should be without even hearing any evidence from anybody about BHS or the circumstances of the last 15 years.\u201d His statement made clear that he had only agreed \u201cin principle\u201d to attend the hearing, which is expected to take place in mid-June. Both parliamentary inquiries will commence on Monday with a joint session looking at the BHS pension fund deficit, taking evidence from Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the Pension Protection Fund, and Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator. The committees will question whether pension regulation is adequate and the impact of covering its liability on the pension protection fund and all the other companies which subscribe to it.",

      "bodyText": "The number of new cars registered in April hit its highest level for 13 years, but the motor industry has warned that uncertainty over Brexit is acting as a drag on sales. Some 189,505 cars were registered during the month, up 2% on the same month last year and the highest number recorded for April since 2003, said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The rise means the UK car market is up 4.4% in the year to date compared to last year, largely thanks to a bumper March when more than 518,000 cars were registered, the second best performance on record. The ongoing increase, a trend the SMMT said was partly down to a plethora of car loan deals, puts the UK on course to beat the 2015 annual record of 2.63m car registrations. But the SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said while the steady rise was a sign of consumer confidence, uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future in the European Union was constraining demand. \u201cConsumer confidence remains high as buyers continue to capitalise on attractive finance deals, although this could be affected by political and economic uncertainty in the coming months,\u201d said Hawes. His view was backed up by separate car sales figures that showed sales grew more substantially in the rest of western Europe, with an 8% rise to 1.2m in April according to data from the industry analysts LMC Automotive. Sales in Spain and Italy rose 21.2% and 11.5% respectively, while Germany recorded an 8.4% rise. The UK\u2019s more modest rise was partly thanks to the increasing popularity of cars that run on alternative fuels, a category that grew by more than a quarter as buyers sought to reduce emissions and running costs. Petrol car registrations rose by 3.4%, while diesel vehicles saw a slight 0.6% decline in registrations. The strongest growth came in the fleet sector, which includes vehicles bought by firms such as taxi companies and delivery services, where new registrations rose by 6.1%. The rise, coupled with a 2.8% increase in the number of cars registered by other types of business, wiped out a 2.5% fall in cars registered by private individuals. The Ford Fiesta was the most popular car among Britons in April with 7,913 registrations, followed by the Volkswagen Golf on 5,645 and the Ford Focus with 5,562.",

      "bodyText": "The Motor insurer Hastings, run by the former Northern Rock boss Gary Hoffman, has posted strong growth in premiums and customer numbers at the start of this year. The firm, which has more than 2.1m customers, floated on the London stock exchange last October. Choppy market conditions forced it to cut its float price to \u00a31.1bn from \u00a31.4bn. Hoffman, who was parachuted in to run Northern Rock in 2008 after its government bailout and became chief executive of Hastings in 2012, said the strong first-quarter performance showed that \u201cwe continue to deliver on our promises\u201d. The shares rose 3.6% to 182.3p on Friday morning, compared with a float price of 170p. Gross written premiums climbed 29% to \u00a3171m in the three months to 31 March, while net revenues were up 22% to \u00a3133m. The number of customer policies rose 17% year-on-year, and Hastings now controls 6% of the market for UK private car insurance policies, up from 5.3% a year ago. Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, said this reflected the fact that \u201cthe barriers to entry are so low that a relative newcomer can gain such scale and market share so quickly \u2026 all OK until the next new entry comes along!\u201d Hastings employs 2,500 people, including more than 500 at its new Leicester site. It was founded by the flamboyant insurance tycoon Neil Utley, who was censured by the Lloyd\u2019s insurance market\u200e in 2013, and stepped down from the board at the time of the float. Flanagan added: \u201cAccording to the group it is well positioned to meet or beat the four targets it set itself at the IPO. Unfortunately the trading update was somewhat light on other important details as regards, for example, claims experience and investment returns. These are pretty crucial metrics to us, especially given the deteriorating claims experience across UK personal motor and the somewhat aggressive investment strategy that Hastings has embraced.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "No one here gets out alive, as rock legend Jim Morrison once sang. But sadly for many of the rock greats it has become almost a cliche that successful musicians and groups are more valued in the grave than in life. Few people understand that better than Jeffrey Jampol, an LA-based specialist whose JAM Inc manages the rock estates of Otis Redding, Kurt Cobain, the Doors, Rick James, Ramones and Muddy Waters among others, as well as advising the co-executors of Michael Jackson\u2019s estate. With the roll call of potential names Jampol could add to his stable increasing as the grim reaper goes about his harvest in rock\u2019nroll hall of fame, Jampol says the heirs to these estates face two key challenges: how to prevent the kind of legal chaos that has paralysed many legends\u2019 fortunes, like the mess that took over James Brown\u2019s estate following his death in 2006, and how to protect and manage that legacy once freed of warring heirs and factions. Jampol, who at one time helped manage New Order in the US, has become the go-to guy for this type of management. Getting it right can generate a fortune. Michael Jackson\u2019s estate is far wealthier now by virtue of the fact that the singer is not around to spend the proceeds or put a wrench in management\u2019s plans. The King of Pop has earned more than $1bn before taxes since his death, according to Forbes, enough to pay off his personal debts and then some. The same is true of the Ramones. The band\u2019s fortunes suffered from a long war of attrition between Joey, the singer, and Johnny, the guitarist, that was carried on by their heirs long after their deaths. Jampol helped to settle grievances so that the current Ramones show at the Queens Museum in New York could take place. \u201cThis is not the music business. This is the pop culture legacy business. I tell clients, if you think it\u2019s about the music, you\u2019ve already failed,\u201d Jampol told the Guardian. \u201cBy that logic, you\u2019d think the magic of James Dean was his acting. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d Merely re-issuing an artist\u2019s work is not enough. Even in the case of Prince, who died intestate (without a will), the mysterious vault said to contain hundreds of unreleased tracks might be no more than a curiosity to collectors that does little to connect Prince to a new generation of fans \u2013 the lifeblood of any legacy act as established fans are lost to natural attrition. It\u2019s not enough, to quote The Smiths\u2019 Paint a Vulgar Picture, to: \u201cRe-issue, re-package, re-package/ Re-evaluate the songs/ Double-pack with a photograph/ Extra track and a tacky badge.\u201d Families often push for this short-term tactic but it can quickly drain a legacy, leaving little behind, said Jampol. Simply putting out best of compilations can end up diminishing an estate\u2019s value. \u201cYou can go into the vault and make a bunch of albums but then it\u2019s done,\u201d he said. Listed foremost on Jam Inc\u2019s Hippocratic Oath of Rock: Do no harm. Too often, the stewards of great legacy artists, in music and other artistic media, chase perceived opportunities without considering their impact upon the legacy they\u2019re supposed to be looking after. Great performers\u2019 works and images are priceless in the eyes of their fans, and every care must be taken to keep that connection intact. What is needed, says Jampol, in a not uncommon moment of management-marketing speak, is to locate the \u201cartist\u2019s essence\u201d. \u201cFigure out what the magic is. There\u2019s something that connects James Dean or Jim Morrison or Kurt Cobain or the Ramones to a 12-year-old whether that\u2019s in 1957 or 2017. It could be a group of facets and then you have to find a way to be put that back into the pop culture in a way that\u2019s credible to a teenager,\u201d he said. It may sound like gauzy marketing speak \u2013 Jampol also lectures as an adjunct professor in music business at UCLA \u2013 still, he has a point. Punk is 40 years old, but \u201cquestioning authority, being an outsider, not caring about the social order are absolutely not dead\u201d. Janis Joplin is a case in point. Jampol says he went to the family ahead of the documentary Little Girl Blue and the successful touring musical Janis and told them he wanted to position her as an icon of hope. But the story he wanted to tell, of being a bi-sexual heroin user might run counter to how they want her story narrated. \u201cJanis wore her heart on her sleeve. She made no bones about wanting to be loved. She wasn\u2019t beautiful. She didn\u2019t come from privilege,\u201d he said. \u201cShe never compromised her vision to succeed. Yet she shattered the glass ceiling without ever compromising her values.\u201d The same was true of Jim Morrison. \u201cI have a simple job \u2013 to talk about everything. Janis\u2019s lovers. Jim Morrison\u2019s alcoholism. I don\u2019t have to manipulate the truth, I just have to reveal it. But you have to understand the context.\u201d Jampol learnt from Danny Sugerman (The Doors\u2019 one time manager) how to negotiate the complex interpersonal relationships of a band. That begs the question, why does the rock and roll dream often end so acrimoniously? \u201cArtists are very passionate about what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut neither bands nor musicians have a great way to process issues, and issues come up over 20 or 30 years. If you don\u2019t have a way to process that, and you add in a few zeros of wealth and a dusting of celebrity that everybody wants\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a prescription for chaos and management headaches long into the future. At the same time new sources of cash are reinvigorating dead artists\u2019 fortunes. Revenue streams now include musicals, museum shows and documentaries. The Jackson documentary This Is It took $261m at the US box office and as much as $400m worldwide. Soon, we could see legacy acts appearing as holograms; the Beatles\u2019 Vegas show brought in millions; Bob Marley\u2019s highly-dysfunctional family puts his name to dozens of products including boomboxes. Like Willie Nelson, the Marley clan has added marijuana to its range of products. It seems the rock legacy business is only getting larger. This week, the California promoter Goldenvoice announced a massive, pre-mortality rock\u2019n\u2019roll mega concert in October featuring Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Neil Young, The Who, Paul McCartney and Roger Waters. With tickets for the three-day festival pegged at a basic $1,599, the acts are expected to take home around $7m a piece. And now Jampol is about to get started on Otis Redding with a new biography and documentary. In September, there will be \u201can evening of respect\u201d at the Big O ranch outside Memphis where Redding\u2019s widow and sons still live. But clearly, there are still big jobs to be done. James Brown\u2019s estate remains tied up in litigation; Jimi Hendrix\u2019s estate is notorious for saying no to every request. Jampol says the one thing you cannot do, is try to imagine what the artists would have thought. It\u2019s not the issue and it\u2019s an impossible question to answer. Estates are not run for artist, or to imagine their wants, but to protect and advance their legacy, Jampol believes. But getting to that stage is seldom easy. With claims from alleged illegitimate children already surfacing, Prince estate could turn into a quagmire of litigation. Prince\u2019s only full sibling, Tyka Nelson, has requested management of his affairs be placed with a special administrator, Bremer Trust, until a representative is appointed - or a will is located. That could still happen. Six days after Michael Jackson died in 2009, his longtime lawyer John Branca filed a will, ending efforts by Jackson\u2019s mother to become his estate\u2019s executor. When a star dies, those left behind often think first of the cash they are losing. They need to think more about posterity, said Jampol. \u201cCan we make any money is the last question you want to ask. I like to animate and lift up the body. Once the artist is back in the cultural conversation, the revenue follows.\u201d",

Even in the case of Prince, who died intestate (without a will), the mysterious vault said to contain hundreds of unreleased tracks might be no more than a curiosity to collectors that does little to connect Prince to a new generation of fans \u2013 the lifeblood of any legacy act as established fans are lost to natural attrition. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3f9e75160118dd25138f80de9e0715c669eab21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3f9e75160118dd25138f80de9e0715c669eab21/0_0_3136_1883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince: died intestate with no clear plans for the future of his legacy and $300m fortune\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince: died intestate with no clear plans for the future of his legacy and $300m fortune</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not enough, to quote The Smiths\u2019 Paint a Vulgar Picture, to: \u201cRe-issue, re-package, re-package/ Re-evaluate the songs/ Double-pack with a photograph/ Extra track and a tacky badge.\u201d Families often push for this short-term tactic but it can quickly drain a legacy, leaving little behind, said Jampol. Simply putting out best of compilations can end up diminishing an estate\u2019s value. \u201cYou can go into the vault and make a bunch of albums but then it\u2019s done,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Listed foremost on Jam Inc\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://wemanagelegends.com/philosophy/\">Hippocratic Oath of Rock</a>: Do no harm. Too often, the stewards of great legacy artists, in music and other artistic media, chase perceived opportunities without considering their impact upon the legacy they\u2019re supposed to be looking after. Great performers\u2019 works and images are priceless in the eyes of their fans, and every care must be taken to keep that connection intact.</p> <p>What is needed, says Jampol, in a not uncommon moment of management-marketing speak, is to locate the \u201cartist\u2019s essence\u201d. \u201cFigure out what the magic is. There\u2019s something that connects James Dean or Jim Morrison or Kurt Cobain or the Ramones to a 12-year-old whether that\u2019s in 1957 or 2017. It could be a group of facets and then you have to find a way to be put that back into the pop culture in a way that\u2019s credible to a teenager,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It may sound like gauzy marketing speak \u2013 Jampol also lectures as an adjunct professor in music business at UCLA \u2013 still, he has a point. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/13/punk-1976-1978-british-library-40th-anniversary-sex-pistols-buzzcocks\">Punk is 40 </a>years old, but \u201cquestioning authority, being an outsider, not caring about the social order are absolutely not dead\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e93b3bdc55fe6a321006bb5c23e40e453ad1eeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e93b3bdc55fe6a321006bb5c23e40e453ad1eeb/0_39_4176_2506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sex Pistols: Punk may be 40 but questioning authority never gets old\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sex Pistols: Punk may be 40 but questioning authority never gets old</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorgen Angel/Redferns via</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Janis Joplin is a case in point. Jampol says he went to the family ahead of the documentary <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/01/janis-joplin-little-girl-blue\">Little Girl Blue</a> and the successful touring musical Janis and told them he wanted to position her as an icon of hope. But the story he wanted to tell, of being a bi-sexual heroin user might run counter to how they want her story narrated.</p> <p>\u201cJanis wore her heart on her sleeve. She made no bones about wanting to be loved. She wasn\u2019t beautiful. She didn\u2019t come from privilege,\u201d he said. \u201cShe never compromised her vision to succeed. Yet she shattered the glass ceiling without ever compromising her values.\u201d</p> <p>The same was true of Jim Morrison. \u201cI have a simple job \u2013 to talk about everything. Janis\u2019s lovers. Jim Morrison\u2019s alcoholism. I don\u2019t have to manipulate the truth, I just have to reveal it. But you have to understand the context.\u201d</p> <p>Jampol learnt from Danny Sugerman (The Doors\u2019 one time manager) how to negotiate the complex interpersonal relationships of a band. That begs the question, why does the rock and roll dream often end so acrimoniously? </p> <p>\u201cArtists are very passionate about what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut neither bands nor musicians have a great way to process issues, and issues come up over 20 or 30 years. If you don\u2019t have a way to process that, and you add in a few zeros of wealth and a dusting of celebrity that everybody wants\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a prescription for chaos and management headaches long into the future.</p> <p>At the same time new sources of cash are reinvigorating dead artists\u2019 fortunes. Revenue streams now include musicals, museum shows and documentaries. The Jackson documentary This Is It took $261m at the US box office and as much as $400m worldwide. Soon, we could see legacy acts appearing as holograms; the Beatles\u2019 Vegas show brought in millions; Bob Marley\u2019s highly-dysfunctional family puts his name to dozens of products including boomboxes. Like Willie Nelson, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/18/bob-marley-marijuana-herb\">Marley clan has added marijuana to its range of products</a>.</p> <p>It seems the rock legacy business is only getting larger. This week, the California promoter Goldenvoice announced a massive, pre-mortality rock\u2019n\u2019roll mega concert in October featuring Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Neil Young, The Who, Paul McCartney and Roger Waters. With tickets for the three-day festival pegged at a basic $1,599, the acts are expected to take home around $7m a piece. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43b3851c6a0e7708786f1d458af87a31ae385c76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43b3851c6a0e7708786f1d458af87a31ae385c76/178_315_2768_1661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Jampol Manager speakin at a Billboard MECCA Conference in Los Angeles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Jampol, speaking at a Billboard MECCA Conference in Los Angeles</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: M. Phillips/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And now Jampol is about to get started on Otis Redding with a new biography and documentary. In September, there will be \u201can evening of respect\u201d at the Big O ranch outside Memphis where Redding\u2019s widow and sons still live. </p> <p>But clearly, there are still big jobs to be done. James Brown\u2019s estate remains tied up in litigation; Jimi Hendrix\u2019s estate is notorious for saying no to every request. Jampol says the one thing you cannot do, is try to imagine what the artists would have thought. It\u2019s not the issue and it\u2019s an impossible question to answer. </p> <p>Estates are not run for artist, or to imagine their wants, but to protect and advance their legacy, Jampol believes. But getting to that stage is seldom easy.</p> <p>With claims from alleged illegitimate children already surfacing, Prince estate could turn into a quagmire of litigation. Prince\u2019s only full sibling, Tyka Nelson, has requested management of his affairs be placed with a special administrator, Bremer Trust, until a representative is appointed - or a will is located. That could still happen. Six days after Michael Jackson died in 2009, his longtime lawyer John Branca filed a will, ending efforts by Jackson\u2019s mother to become his estate\u2019s executor. </p> <p>When a star dies, those left behind often think first of the cash they are losing. They need to think more about posterity, said Jampol. \u201cCan we make any money is the last question you want to ask. I like to animate and lift up the body. Once the artist is back in the cultural conversation, the revenue follows.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "British Airways passengers will be able to stream films on transatlantic flights from next year after the airline\u2019s owners, IAG, announced a deal to install what it claims will be the fastest Wi-Fi in the air. While BA has lagged behind competitors in providing Wi-Fi on its flights, Willie Walsh, the IAG chief executive, said technological advances have vindicated the decision to wait. No decision has been taken on the cost to passengers but Walsh hinted it was likely to be free for basic browsing with charges for a faster service allowing downloads and video streaming. The technology would in theory allow Skype or Facetime conversations, though they are likely to be blocked to avoid annoying other passengers. The Wi-Fi will be provided by Gogo, a Chicago-based aircraft communications firm that has rolled out web access for US domestic flights, including Delta\u2019s 6,000-plane fleet, largely via ground-to-air networks. It said the average price for US flyers was typically around $13 (\u00a38) an hour for fast internet. The latest \u201c2ku\u201d technology employs satellites, with more compact and aerodynamic antennae on planes than previous versions, lowering the operating costs in terms of fuel burn for airlines. The terms of the deal were not disclosed but with BA looking to fit out 118 planes, as well as four from Aer Lingus and 15 from Iberia, IAG\u2019s investment in Wi-Fi with Gogo is thought to reach tens of millions of pounds per year. BA\u2019s British rival Virgin Atlantic and its US part-owners Delta are rolling out similar satellite Wi-Fi with Gogo, though the capacity of the modems on IAG\u2019s planes at 70Mbps would allow more passengers to have fast internet access, a Gogo spokesman said. AeroMexico already has the system in operation. Walsh said: \u201cWe believe this will be the fastest Wi-Fi in the air. You can have everyone on board using multiple devices and streaming. There\u2019s nothing more frustrating for a passenger than being told it\u2019s there and you\u2019re waiting there with your screen to upload or refresh. \u201cGiven the global scale we have we needed something to guarantee connectivity right across the network.\u201d IAG said 90% of its long-haul fleet will have fast Wi-Fi by 2019, many retrofitted, while new A350s on order will have the antenna built in. Walsh said: \u201cThe key concern we had was making sure that the technology was mature enough. If you start drilling holes in an aircraft you want to make sure it\u2019s going to be there permanently and going to work.\u201d He added that he had learned from personal experience in buying a Betamax video player decades ago, before it was supplanted by VHS. \u201cA few airlines, I wouldn\u2019t say they panicked, but to get in the game they got technology quickly which they are now having to change.\u201d Fast Wi-Fi could likely see the eventual end of wired-in seat-back entertainment on planes, Walsh said, with passengers preferring to stream as they would at home. But Skyping will likely be blocked. Making phonecalls has been possible, albeit costly, for years, Walsh said: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that the demand is very little.\u201d BA has had a limited Wi-Fi service on its New York A318 jets from London City airport, and passengers surveys showed the majority did not want voice conversations permitted.",
