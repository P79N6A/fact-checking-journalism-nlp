      "bodyText": "Michael Saunders, the most recent appointee to the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate setting committee, is to warn that the Bank\u2019s forecasts of weak growth next year are likely to be wrong and the economy could recover strongly from the dip after the Brexit vote. Speaking to business leaders in Manchester on Wednesday, the former investment banker will say the economy was more resilient than many economists believed, including officials at the bank, and may grow at an accelerated pace in 2017. But he is to hint that he is unlikely to vote for a rate rise in the next few months following his assessment of the labour market, which showed the bank\u2019s forecasts of strong wage rises in 2017 and 2018 were optimistic. He will say employers are in a position to use Britain\u2019s flexible employment laws to keep wages in check, even when unemployment fell well below the 5% level Threadneedle Street has agreed should trigger higher wage claims. \u201cMy policy vote will probably depend on which of these factors is dominating,\u201d he will say. Saunders voted to keep interest rates unchanged at a record low 0.25% last month, at his first monetary policy committee meeting since joining the Bank from the US banking group Citi, where he was the chief UK economist. Britain\u2019s economy will likely \u201cnot be too bad\u201d in the year ahead, barring a sharp rise in global or Brexit-related uncertainty, according to the text of his speech released on Tuesday. The comments echo those of fellow policymaker Kristin Forbes, who said recently that business surveys indicated the economy has fared better than feared after June\u2019s EU referendum. After its policy meeting in early September, the Bank said most officials expected to cut rates again this year if growth looked on track to slow broadly as forecast in August. Saunders will emphasise that the Bank has plenty of ammunition left in its arsenal if the economy fares worse \u2013 or better \u2013 than it expects in future. He is to say interest rates could start to rise as early as next year if the economy proves resilient, taking to task economists who believe lacklustre global trade growth, flexible labour markets and persistently low business investment will limit the scope for rate rises. Saunders will also say a reversal in the UK\u2019s fortunes, provoking a slump in GDP growth, could be countered with an expansion of the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme and a further cut in the base rate to zero. The Bank has substantial scope for further stimulus through asset purchases if required, he will say.",

      "bodyText": "Investors\u2019 first instinct, as they woke on Friday 24 June to news that the UK had voted for Brexit, was to sell shares. This didn\u2019t feel remotely odd at the time. Sterling was plunging, the prime minister would resign by mid-morning and shares, in theory, are meant to be the asset you don\u2019t want to own when there is a whiff of panic in the air. Tough luck if you sold your FTSE 100 tracker fund on Monday 27 June, the day the index closed a shade below 6000 points. You\u2019ve just missed a remarkable 1100-point run to 7074. The vote for Brexit created the best buying opportunity for years. Or, rather, it was a golden chance if you are a sterling investor. As everybody knows by now, the single biggest factor fuelling the Footsie\u2019s surge has been the weakness of the pound. Most of the gain reflects currency adjustments. The profits generated overseas by big UK-listed multinationals \u2013 BP, Shell, the crew of miners, the cigarette merchants, the pharmaceutical giants, HSBC, Unilever, etcetera \u2013 are worth more when converted back into sterling, the currency in which their shares are quoted. Calculated in terms of US dollars, the FTSE 100 has gone roughly sideways since the referendum. GlaxoSmithKline illustrates the point. If you bought on the day of the referendum at \u00a314.29, you\u2019re up 18.7% with the share price now at \u00a316.96. But if you are a US investor and bought the dollar-denominated American Depositary Receipts (each one represents two ordinary shares), it\u2019s as if nothing has happened. The price of a Glaxo ADR has ticked up from $42.56 on referendum day to $43.30 on Tuesday \u2013 a gain of about 2%. It all depends on where you\u2019re sitting. Thus the sight of the Footsie above 7000 is the secondary story. Sterling\u2019s slide to a 31-year low against the dollar is the main event, and the reason why chancellor Philip Hammond should stop saying, as he did again on Monday, that \u201cthe markets have calmed since the referendum vote.\u201d Shares have calmed but sterling hasn\u2019t. The currency still tends to slip on every indication from ministers that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d is on the cards. Those pundits suggesting the pound could fall to $1.20 against the dollar, versus Tuesday\u2019s $1.27, may be proved correct. Yet Hammond would be right to claim that even $1.20 would not represent a crisis. In trade-weighted terms, the pound currently sits at a six-and-a-half-year low, which feels roughly the right level. First, the vote for Brexit has plainly created all the uncertainties that caused the IMF to cut its growth forecast for the UK next year to 1.1%. Second, the UK also needs to get its current account deficit under control and a weaker currency offers the best hope on that front. An overshoot on the low side would not be the worst problem for the UK economy to have. That is true as long as a weaker pound doesn\u2019t cause eruptions elsewhere. But, as matters stand, there are no signs of distress in bond markets, or even worries that a weaker currency will deliver a nasty dose of inflation. There\u2019s still time, of course, and the risk rises the further the pound falls. But, right now, the UK can borrow for 10 years at a rate of 0.8%. That feels a very long way from crisis levels. \u00a340m payday for Jeremy and chums Currency winds have also played a role in the entertaining scrap for SVG Capital, the quoted firm that invests in private equity funds. To recap: US fund HarbourVest Partners made a \u00a31bn, or 650p-a-share, offer last month in what looked to be a smash-and-grab raid. HarbourVest declared its offer final, thereby ruling out improved terms, and invited quick acceptances. Not so fast, said SVG, which had another look at its assets (most of which are euro and dollar denominated) and came up with a value of 735p a share, rather than the 666p it had offered the last time it spoke. Everyone is allowed to believe their investments are improving in value but the trick in a bid situation is to find someone prepared to agree \u2013 and then to pay up. SVG has only half succeeded. Late in the day, it said on Tuesday that two other private equity investors, Pomona Capital and Pantheon Ventures, are willing to buy half the investment portfolio for \u00a3379m. That is still a discount to the book value for those assets, calculated at \u00a3401m, but, crucially, is a tighter discount than the one implied by the HarbourVest offer. HarbourVest can protest that it is willing to buy all the investments, rather than half, and that SVG\u2019s self-liquidation plan is riddled with uncertainties. Fair comment. But at least SVG\u2019s board has given its shareholders a choice: they can have 650p for a quick sale to an opportunist bidder or they can take their chances on seeing 700p-ish via an orderly, but still brisk, liquidation. Either outcome would represent a triumph for Jeremy Coller, whose Coller Capital outfit rescued SVG by injecting cash at 100p for a 20% stake in 2009. Coller Capital should make a sixfold-plus return from a punt taken in the depths of the financial crisis. And remember, in the fee-heavy private equity industry, the partners usually keep a fifth of the uplift for themselves. Call it a \u00a340m payday for Jeremy and chums for riding the recovery.",

    "webTitle": "Construction sector bounces back after post-referendum slump", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Housebuilding surged in September, smashing City expectations and lifting the construction industry out of an EU referendum-induced slump. The civil engineering sector also grew last month and helped push the Markit/Cips UK construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) to 52.3, up from 49.2 in August and the first increase in activity since March. The rise marked a sharp turnaround from a three-and-a-half-year low in June and a seven-year low in July induced by panicky property developers spooked by the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union. Only commercial building continued to slide as international investors remained wary of office and shop construction in London and south-east England, which has driven most of the sector\u2019s expansion over recent years. Tim Moore, a senior economist at financial data firm IHS Markit, said the better than expected news about the economy\u2019s resilience following the Brexit vote had helped the construction industry regain confidence. The announcement at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham of \u00a35bn of funding for housebuilding is likely to bolster that confident outlook. He said: \u201cResilient housing market conditions and a renewed upturn in civil engineering activity helped to drive an overall improvement in construction output volumes for the first time since the EU referendum. A number of survey respondents noted that Brexit-related anxiety has receded among clients, although it remained a factor behind the ongoing decline in commercial building work.\u201d He added that construction firms appeared to be optimistic about the next few months \u201cwith confidence linked to the fastest rise in new orders since March and a more upbeat economic news flow in general\u201d. However, Moore warned that the rebound still left the sector \u201con a much weaker growth trajectory than seen at the start of 2016, which contrasts with the export-led surge in manufacturing production during September\u201d. He said: \u201cNot only are UK construction companies feeling the impact of subdued investment spending relative to earlier this year, but the weak pound has contributed to a sharp acceleration in cost inflation. There were again widespread reports that domestic suppliers had acted quickly to pass on higher imported raw material costs, despite softer demand conditions in recent months.\u201d Earlier this week, the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, attacked \u201cnimbyism\u201d for restricting the number of new homes as he unveiled \u201cunprecedented\u201d plans to \u201copen up the market\u201d with what he described as the largest state-backed housing programme since the 1970s. He told the Tory conference that the Treasury would borrow \u00a32bn to support an \u201caccelerated construction\u201d scheme, which aims to get houses built on publicly-owned \u201cbrownfield\u201d land, and kickstart a \u00a33bn home building fund to provide loans to build more than 25,000 homes by 2020. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, was unimpressed by the promise of extra loans to the housing sector, saying the initiatives only reversed planned cuts by the Treasury. He said: \u201cPromises of new money to facilitate construction on public sector land from the chancellor and the pick-up in the construction PMI have fostered optimism that the sector\u2019s downturn is over. \u201cWe remained concerned, however, that the construction sector will suffer from a prolonged dearth of business investment and will continue to be constrained by skill shortages.\u201d",

A number of survey respondents noted that Brexit-related anxiety has receded among clients, although it remained a factor behind the ongoing decline in commercial building work.\u201d</p> <p>He added that construction firms appeared to be optimistic about the next few months \u201cwith confidence linked to the fastest rise in new orders since March and a more upbeat economic news flow in general\u201d. </p> <p>However, Moore warned that the rebound still left the sector \u201con a much weaker growth trajectory than seen at the start of 2016, which contrasts with the export-led surge in manufacturing production during September\u201d. </p> <p>He said: \u201cNot only are UK construction companies feeling the impact of subdued investment spending relative to earlier this year, but the weak pound has contributed to a sharp acceleration in cost inflation. There were again widespread reports that domestic suppliers had acted quickly to pass on higher imported raw material costs, despite softer demand conditions in recent months.\u201d </p> <p>Earlier this week, the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, attacked \u201cnimbyism\u201d for restricting the number of new homes as he unveiled \u201cunprecedented\u201d plans to \u201copen up the market\u201d with what he described as the largest state-backed housing programme since the 1970s. </p> <p>He told the Tory conference that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-to-set-out-his-stall-for-balanced-budget-at-tory-conference\">the Treasury would borrow \u00a32bn to support an \u201caccelerated construction\u201d scheme</a>, which aims to get houses built on publicly-owned \u201cbrownfield\u201d land, and kickstart a \u00a33bn home building fund to provide loans to build more than 25,000 homes by 2020.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, was unimpressed by the promise of extra loans to the housing sector, saying the initiatives only reversed planned cuts by the Treasury.</p> <p>He said: \u201cPromises of new money to facilitate construction on public sector land from the chancellor and the pick-up in the construction PMI have fostered optimism that the sector\u2019s downturn is over.</p> <p>\u201cWe remained concerned, however, that the construction sector will suffer from a prolonged dearth of business investment and will continue to be constrained by skill shortages.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The pound has fallen to a 31-year low amid signs that the UK government is leading the country into a hard exit from the European Union. At the same time, the FTSE 100 \u2013 Britain\u2019s most prestigious stock market index \u2013 is close to reaching an all time high. Why is Britain\u2019s currency suffering while shares in its biggest companies are soaring? Why has the pound fallen? Theresa May sent a strong signal on Sunday that curbs on immigration were more important than remaining inside the EU\u2019s single market. Investors take a dim view of the UK pulling out of the EU\u2019s tariff-free zone. They also don\u2019t like the notion of restrictions on immigration that deny employers vital staff. Both policies will reduce GDP growth, they believe. Investors began to sell the pound soon after the speech and the momentum increased following a warning from the chancellor of the exchequer on Monday that the next two years will be a difficult time for the economy. On Tuesday, May repeated her warning that a hard Brexit was likely, which provoked another round of selling. Why, at the same time, is the stock market rising? There are two key reasons. The first is that many FTSE 100 firms earn their revenues in dollars. Among them are the largest on the London exchange: oil majors BP and Shell; the mining companies BHP Billiton and Anglo American; and banks such as HSBC. As the value of dollars rises versus the pound, the profits of these companies increase. They become more valuable and the stock market goes up as a consequence. Second, share prices have been increasing all year in response to prevarication by the US central bank, which has struggled to raise interest rates despite signalling a willingness to do so. The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are already offering zero or negative interest rates. If the Federal Reserve cannot increase rates from the current 0.5%, then investors must put their money into shares in order to earn a return. Does it matter that the pound is falling? The pound was worth $1.55 last October. Now it is hovering around $1.27. A year ago the pound bought \u20ac1.34. Like the dollar, the euro is also stronger and a pound will buy a little less than \u20ac1.12. According to some economists the 20% drop against the dollar and even bigger slide against the euro is a good thing, boosting exports and deterring the consumption of increasingly expensive imports. This gives manufacturing sales a lift and helps the balance of payments, which is in a significant deficit currently. It is also hoped that holidaymakers will want to stay at home, spending their money in British resorts and not continental destinations. The alternative view is that the pound\u2019s value is a measure of the country\u2019s worth relative to other nations and the recent falls means the UK is probably not the fifth largest economy in the world anymore, but the sixth or seventh. Can the pound fall too far? A trap door might open under sterling should the Tory messaging around a hard Brexit be taken as a sure sign that Britain will be shut out of the single market altogether. The pound almost reached parity with the dollar in the mid 1980s, but only for a brief period. It would be considered by most economists to be a huge vote of no confidence in the economy if there was a repetition. Is the stock market too high? The MSCI index of global stock markets is around the same level as before the 2008 financial crash. This is a huge worry, especially when much of the money in stocks and shares in the UK, the US, Japan and Frankfurt is invested by default. In other words, it is invested by fund managers who cannot get a decent return on other assets, especially corporate and government bonds. Therefore, the rising value of global stock markets is not related to profits, which are flat or declining, but just the welter of cash pouring into the exchanges. If there is an economic shock of some kind, it could trigger a panic, and then markets would have a long way to fall.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK stock markets soared on Tuesday, helped by a slump in the pound as it fell to a new 31-year low against the dollar amid growing fears that Britain could leave the single market after Brexit. The FTSE 100 index of Britain\u2019s leading companies \u2013 which is dominated by companies that earn revenues in dollars \u2013 surged to 7,074.34, closing at its highest level since the record finish of 7,104 in April 2015. It came tantalisingly close to beating that landmark before a last-minute spate of profit taking. However, the FTSE 250 mid-cap index closed at a new peak, as investors shrugged off the gloom that surrounded markets at the start of the year and in the aftermath of the UK\u2019s EU referendum in June. The share gains came as the pound dropped to its worst level since June 1985, falling to $1.2721, down 0.9%. Against the euro, sterling hit a three-year low of \u20ac1.1365, down 0.8%. The latest falls in the currency followed Theresa May\u2019s announcement on Sunday that the government would trigger the process of leaving the European Union by the end of March 2017, as well as subsequent comments suggesting it would place a priority on restricting immigration into the UK, even at the expense of leaving the single market. The pound has also been hit by the Bank of England cutting interest rates in August and suggesting further reductions could come later in the year. May told the BBC that the UK\u2019s economy was strong and currencies \u201cof course go up and down\u201d. Many analysts believe the pound has further to fall. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at betting firm Spreadex, said: \u201cIt seems that it is going to be hard to provide a tourniquet for sterling\u2019s recent wounds given the solidity of the newly announced Brexit timeline ... and the firmness with which May stated her intention to chase border control even if it means relinquishing Britain\u2019s position in the single market.\u201d Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: \u201cA move down to $1.25, and even $1.20 is now a possibility ... The all-time low for the pound/dollar from March 1985 is $1.05. We don\u2019t expect to return to these lows; back in 1985 the pound only briefly dipped to $1.05 before recovering sharply.\u201d But the weakness in the pound helped lift the international companies and exporters which dominate the FTSE 100, making their goods cheaper for foreign buyers and boosting their profits. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at fund manager Aviva Investors, said the market was being driven by different factors to a year ago, when optimism over the health of the eurozone helped push shares upwards. He said: \u201cThe dynamics driving the index towards a record high are different from [2015], when we last witnessed the index go over 7,000. Then it was about falling oil prices and optimism on the eurozone recovery. This time, it materially revolves around currency ... Overseas earners benefit from the translation of these earnings back to sterling, leading to a succession of companies upgrading their earnings forecasts for currency alone.\u201d The index of Britain\u2019s 100 largest listed companies closed up 90.82 points or 1.3% to reach 7074.34, a revival of 28% since it hit a 2016 low of 5537 in February. At that point, investors were unnerved by signs of a global slowdown, a plunge in the oil price and worries about the effect of low interest rates on bank balance sheets. The FTSE is also 18% higher than the 5982 level it fell to in June following the Brexit vote. The more domestically focussed FTSE 250 jumped 0.87% to 18,342.07. Again the pound\u2019s weakness helped make company valuations more attractive to both overseas investors and possible predators seeking takeovers. The index was also lifted by signs that dire warnings of recession made before the Brexit vote looked misplaced, at least for the moment. UK construction bounced back in September, according to the latest Markit/Cips survey, with its purchasing managers\u2019 index rising to a better-than-expected 52.3 from 49.2 in August, the first increase since March. That followed news on Monday that UK manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace for more than two years in September, with stronger export orders on the back of the pound\u2019s continuing weakness. Investors were also lifted by news that the International Monetary Fund, which was one of those warning of a severe downturn if the UK voted to leave the European Union, was now predicting the UK would be the fastest growing of the G7 industrialised nations this year. The IMF is forecasting UK growth of 1.8% in 2016, up 0.1 percentage points from its previous prediction in July, albeit falling to 1.1% in 2017. Markets around the globe have also been supported by a revival in commodity prices, notably oil, which has stabilised following last week\u2019s outline of a deal by producers to tackle the supply glut by curbing output. And with low interest rates and bond yields, investors seeking a decent return on their money have been tempted into the stock market. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cLower interest rates have also given the stock market a leg up, because with cash and bonds yielding next to nothing, equities are the natural alternative for anyone looking for a decent level of income. \u201cNor will there be any shortage of income-seekers at the moment, as millions of baby boomers are reaching retirement age, while the recent pension freedoms conveniently allow them to park their retirement funds in the stock market rather than buying an annuity.\u201d However, analysts also pointed out that if the weakness of the pound is taken into account and is balanced against the FTSE\u2019s performance last year when the pound was stronger, the index has actually fallen around 2% so far this year.",

We don\u2019t expect to return to these lows; back in 1985 the pound only briefly dipped to $1.05 before recovering sharply.\u201d </p> <p>But the weakness in the pound helped lift the international companies and exporters which dominate the FTSE 100, making their goods cheaper for foreign buyers and boosting their profits.</p> <p>Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at fund manager Aviva Investors, said the market was being driven by different factors to a year ago, when optimism over the health of the eurozone helped push shares upwards. He said: \u201cThe dynamics driving the index towards a record high are different from [2015], when we last witnessed the index go over 7,000. Then it was about falling oil prices and optimism on the eurozone recovery. This time, it materially revolves around currency ... Overseas earners benefit from the translation of these earnings back to sterling, leading to a succession of companies upgrading their earnings forecasts for currency alone.\u201d</p> <p>The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/ftse-100-near-record-high-pound-31-year-low\">index of Britain\u2019s 100 largest listed companies closed up 90.82 points or 1.3% to reach 7074.34</a>, a revival of 28% since it hit a 2016 low of 5537 in February.

Again the pound\u2019s weakness helped make company valuations more attractive to both overseas investors and possible predators seeking takeovers.</p> <p>The index was also lifted by signs that dire warnings of recession made before the Brexit vote looked misplaced, at least for the moment. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/construction-sector-housebuilding-post-referendum-slump-brexit-vote\">UK construction bounced back in September</a></strong>, according to the latest Markit/Cips survey, with its purchasing managers\u2019 index rising to a better-than-expected 52.3 from 49.2 in August, the first increase since March. That followed news on Monday that <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/uk-stocks-rally-as-brexit-fears-fade\">UK manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace for more than two years in September</a></strong>, with stronger export orders on the back of the pound\u2019s continuing weakness.</p> <p>Investors were also lifted by news that the International Monetary Fund, which was one of those warning of a severe downturn if the UK voted to leave the European Union, was <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/britain-fastest-growing-g7-economy-imf-international-monetary-fund-brexit-vote\">now predicting the UK would be the fastest growing of the G7 industrialised nations this year.</a> </strong>The IMF is forecasting UK growth of 1.8% in 2016, up 0.1 percentage points from its previous prediction in July, albeit falling to 1.1% in 2017.</p> <p>Markets around the globe have also been supported by a revival in commodity prices, notably oil, which has stabilised following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/oil-prices-rise-6-opec-agrees-limit-crude-output\"><strong>last week\u2019s outline of a deal by producers to tackle the supply glut by curbing output</strong></a>.</p> <p>And with low interest rates and bond yields, investors seeking a decent return on their money have been tempted into the stock market. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cLower interest rates have also given the stock market a leg up, because with cash and bonds yielding next to nothing, equities are the natural alternative for anyone looking for a decent level of income.</p> <p>\u201cNor will there be any shortage of income-seekers at the moment, as millions of baby boomers are reaching retirement age, while the recent pension freedoms conveniently allow them to park their retirement funds in the stock market rather than buying an annuity.\u201d</p> <p>However, analysts also pointed out that if the weakness of the pound is taken into account and is balanced against the FTSE\u2019s performance last year when the pound was stronger, the index has actually fallen around 2% so far this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-04T16:52:34/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Pound v Dollar\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-04T16:52:34/embed.html\">Pound v Dollar</a> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "The value of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies came close to an all-time closing high on Tuesday as the stock market benefited from a plunge in the value of sterling. The FTSE 100 closed at 7,074.34, taking it closer to the 7,104 record reached in April 2015. Shortly before closing, the FTSE came within one point of the all-time intra-day high of 7,122 but the index fell away during the closing auction. The FTSE 250 index of more domestically focused medium-sized firms also received a boost, climbing 0.8% to an all-time closing high of 18,342. Analysts said the market had reacted strongly to concerns that Theresa May would support quitting the European Union with only a rudimentary trade deal that would cost the UK growth and jobs. A speech by the prime minister at the weekend and her comments on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday morning appeared to show that the government would leave the EU\u2019s tariff-free customs union after prioritising curbs on immigration. The likelihood of a so-called hard Brexit sent the pound plummeting to a fresh 31-year low, just above $1.27. Listed companies that earn the bulk of their revenues in dollars, including BP and Shell, mining companies Anglo American and BHP Billiton, as well as Europe\u2019s largest bank, HSBC, are expected to see annual profits increase after the currency shift, making their shares more attractive. Expectations that the UK will be a drag on global growth, limiting the scope for the US central bank to raise interest rates, has also encouraged investors to suspend plans to invest in government bonds in favour of stocks and shares, lifting London and other major exchanges. Kathleen Brooks, research director at the City Index spread-betting firm, said a recovery in sterling was unlikely over the next few months. \u201cThe latest news from the Conservative party conference is that Theresa May is playing hardball with the City and is failing to guarantee a special status post-Brexit for the UK\u2019s financial services sector. While politics is king, this is stymieing any chance of a pound recovery,\u201d she said. Brooks also said Philip Hammond\u2019s warning that Britain\u2019s economy was heading for a \u201crollercoaster\u201d ride over the coming years had compounded the sterling sell-off. She said the pound could fall to $1.25, or even $1.20. The all-time low from March 1985 is $1.05 to the pound. John Wraith, head of UK rates strategy at UBS, was equally pessimistic about a recovery of the pound, warning that it could suffer a fate similar to that during the financial crisis. \u201cWhen the global financial crisis entered its acute phase, sterling resumed its rapid decline, falling a further 20% by the end of 2008. Although different in its underlying causes, a similar pattern of decline, pause and fresh falls may be unfolding now,\u201d he said.",

Sterling traded as low as $1.2721, its weakest point since 1985, on growing expectations that the UK will leave the single market. Currency expert Kathleen Brooks, of FOREX.com and City Index, pinned the blame on events at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham. The Tory party conference is turning into a sell for the pound, as FX traders get spooked by May\u2019s apparent sanguine attitude to leaving the single market, preferring to focus on immigration and UK sovereignty rather than the economic fallout of Brexit. PM Theresa May has insisted that the economy is in good shape, with growth looking solid and unemployment low. While the pound weakened, Britain\u2019s stock market went on a tear today. The FTSE 100 jumped by 90 points, having come within a whisker of hitting its alltime intraday high. The smaller FTSE 250 index did hit a record high. Analysts said the weak pound had helped to drive share prices higher, as it will help exports and make overseas earnings more valuable. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says: Reports that UK Prime Minister Theresa May is not looking for any favourable treatment for the financial services sector has been cited as one reason behind the latest sterling decline. It wasn\u2019t all currency effect through \u2013 the FTSE 250, which does have its fair share of firms with foreign earnings, is more domestically focused. At the moment, UK investors are getting their cake and eating it. The threat of more rate cuts and money-printing from the Bank of England if the government chooses a \u201cHard Brexit\u201d has sent the British pound lower, but UK economic data continues to impress. The International Monetary Fund pulled a u-turn, admitting that Britain won\u2019t fall into recession next year. It expects the UK to be the best-performing G7 country this year, before slowing in 2017. Michael Saunders, a Bank of England policymaker, has predicted that Brexit won\u2019t be as bad as feared. And a new survey has shown that the construction sector returned to growth in September; the latest sign that British companies aren\u2019t being toppled by Brexit fears. There\u2019s loads more analyst comment and reaction if you scroll back through the blog. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow for more coverage, including a healthcheck on the UK services sector. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Prime minister Theresa May has insisted tonight that the economic fundamentals of the UK economy remain strong. During an interview with the BBC, May pointed to recent upbeat surveys - and the new forecasts issued by the IMF today. And asked about the pound hitting a 31-year low today, she said: Currencies of course go up and down. If you look at the fundamentals of the economy, it\u2019s strong. If you look at recent economic data, the forecasts coming out now for growth this year, it\u2019s all more positive than people had expected it to be. She also reiterated that she wants to get the \u201cright deal\u201d for the UK; one that lets British businesses both operate in and trade with the single market. Despite today\u2019s soaring shares, the weakness of the pound underlines that there are big worries about Brexit. James Andrews, head of investment management at stockbroking firm Redmayne-Bentley, warns that a selloff could be painful: \u201cThe heady heights we see in the UK equity markets currently reflect the lack of returns to be found in less risky assets, such as cash and bonds. The FTSE 100 is no longer a gauge of the UK economy, given it is full of large multi-national companies, but the more domestic-focussed FTSE 250 is also touching all-time highs. \u201cThe likely fallout of messy negotiations around the exit from the EU mean it is an uncomfortable view from the summit currently, and it\u2019s a long way down if the future turns out to be less than rosy.\u201d We do have a record to celebrate, though. The FTSE 250 index has closed at its highest ever level, up 0.9% or 158 points at 18342. That\u2019s significant, as this index contains more UK companies than the Footsie 100 -- including engineering firm Renishaw (+4% today) and security firm G4S (+3.3%). A groan ripples around City trading floors, as the FTSE 100 fails to hit a new record closing high. The blue-chip index closed up 90 points, or 1.3%, at 7074. That is a new 17-month closing high, but not the record. It was still a good day for shares, with some internationally focused firms like Rolls-Royce and Pearson leading the rally. But the temptation to take profits took the wind out of the markets\u2019 sails at the end. It was quite a dramatic day, as Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains: Today\u2019s incredible rise in the FTSE 100 has been one of the biggest risk on moves of the year, with investors seeing in Q4 with a bang. Fears over the economic implications of a Brexit have been brushed aside in favour of a focus on the benefits a weak pound and loose monetary policy would bring to stocks. As Phillip Hammond said, we are in for a roller coaster, yet on initial evidence, markets like the idea. The stock market has gone into its closing auction!.... And we\u2019re about to find out if the FTSE 100 has hit a new record closing high.... Michael Saunders, the newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, has fired a broadside at his colleagues for being too pessimistic over Brexit. In a speech just released (due to be given tomorrow), Saunders says that the EU will probably cause rather less damage than policymakers had feared. He cites Britain\u2019s \u201cconsiderable supply-side advantages\u201d, from its flexible labour market and openness to foreign investment, to the current \u201clow-ish\u201d tax rates and strong position in high-tech manufacturing and knowledge-intensive services. So Saunders (who was a top economist at Citigroup until he joined the BoE rate-setting this summer), reckons growth in 2017 will be stronger than expected. After a good lunch, Saunders will tell the Institute of Directors in Manchester tomorrow that: The process of EU exit may be lengthy and bumpy. It is certainly possible that anticipation of EU exit will have a greater near-term adverse effect on the economy than the MPC expect, especially if EU nationals currently working in the UK decide to leave or business investment weakens really markedly. But, unless Brexit-related uncertainties rise sharply and/or global conditions disappoint markedly, I suspect that the UK economy will be not too bad in the year ahead, with growth in 2017 more likely to be clearly above 1% rather than (as the consensus expects) below 1%. Hence, especially if productivity growth remains modest, there may be little or no rise in unemployment in the UK over the coming year, although the current degree of slack would remain unless growth is strong enough to cut unemployment further. You can see the speech here (lunch, alas, not included) The economic outlook - speech by Michael Saunders Some investors who bought shares after the Brexit vote will be cashing in their hard-earned gains winnings this afternoon. So says Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer at online dealing group TD Direct Investing. \u201cWith the FTSE peaking 7,100 this afternoon, our customers are predominantly selling today - demonstrating their savviness. Experienced investors have been buying up since Brexit and seemingly now enjoying the profits. The important thing for the markets is that it holds 7,000 overnight \u2013 this will be impacted by how the S&amp;P 500 behaves. She also urges small investors to be cautious... \u201cFrom a broader perspective, we hope that those less experienced investors aren\u2019t getting too excited by the excitement and piling in, for the first time, while it\u2019s high \u2013 this isn\u2019t the best investment strategy and they will lose their confidence yet again.\u201d Ben Chu, the economics editor of the Independent, has done a nice piece about the causes of the pound\u2019s weakness. He says: This week\u2019s renewed downward lurch has coincided with Theresa May saying she will trigger Article 50 before next March and making it clear that she will not compromise on curbing EU immigration to the UK, something that strongly implies Britain will be out of the single market by 2019. The fundamental reason for sterling\u2019s descent is that traders believe there will be lower demand for sterling assets as a result of Brexit \u2013 that we will ultimately do less trade with the rest of the world and that we will be poorer as a result. Argue the markets are wrong if you want to \u2013 but recognise what they are saying. Financial reporters are squinting at their terminals, desperate to see if the Footsie hits a record high today (we\u2019re easily amused, to be honest) Ooooh the FTSE 100 is pushing even higher as the clock ticks down to 4.30pm. It just hit 7121 points, a whisker away from the record intraday high of 7122 (set in April 2015). Oh, and I made a mistake before. The all-time record closing high is 7104. And that record is ON.... With one hour to go, the FTSE 100 index is just three points away from its record closing high, at 7009 points. Richard Stone, chief executive at The Share Centre, explains why the weak pound has pushed shares up: For companies in the FTSE100, some three quarters of their revenues are not earned in Sterling so are now worth more in Sterling terms. This makes their profits higher in Sterling and therefore their value in Sterling terms also increases. The IMF\u2019s new report hasn\u2019t helped the pound; it\u2019s still wallowing at the 31-year low of $1.275. Betway, the gambling firm, are offering odds on it falling further, and even hitting parity, before the end of the year. Lowest GBP/USD rate in 2016: $1.2 - 1.28: 4/9 $1.1 - 1.19: 3/1 $1 \u2013 1.09: 5/1 $ to be stronger than \u00a3 at any point in 2016: 50/1 This won\u2019t please Donald Trump. The IMF thinks the US Federal Reserve was right not to raise interest rates last month. Maurice Obstfeld has told reporters that there\u2019s no sign that the American economy needs to be reined in. He says: At the moment, inflation is below their target levels,wage pressures are moderate, and so there doesn\u2019t seem to be a great danger of overheating. Trump has accused the Fed of keeping rates too low, to help Hillary Clinton win the presidential election. Quite a lively press conference.... IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld has defended the Fund\u2019s bleak predictions about Brexit. Quizzed by journalists in Washington, Obstfeld says Britain is enjoying a \u201csoft landing\u201d. This, he claims, was: \u201cone of our scenarios, and the one we are happier to have seen than the alternative worst scenarios\u201d. Obstfeld says the weaker pound has provided some support to the economy, by helping exporters. He also credits the Bank of England with acting quickly to shore up confidence after the referendum result came in. If the IMF are right, Britain\u2019s economy is going to slow pretty sharply next year: Chancellor Philip Hammond has opined: Today\u2019s forecasts show that the IMF should be embarrassed about its hand-wringing before June\u2019s referendum, writes Larry Elliott from Washington. Everybody makes duff forecasts. Everybody gets it wrong from time to time. Only the inveterate fence sitters are spared having egg on their face. The International Monetary Fund certainly knows what it is like to make a mistake. In the run-up to the EU referendum, the IMF made a series of interventions warning voters of the dire consequences that would follow a vote to leave. At first, the IMF stuck to long-term forecasts, saying investment and trade would eventually be weaker if the UK divorced from the other 27 members of the EU. But as the referendum neared and the vote was on a knife-edge, the warnings became more lurid. The UK would immediately start sliding into recession. House prices would crumble. Shares would crash. So what do you do if your forecasts turn out to be a little wide of the mark? Either you put your hands up and admit you were wrong. Or you brazen it out. You say that it is too early to say. You say that eventually you will come right. No prizes for guessing which option the IMF has taken. Its half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) report says the UK will do fine in 2016 but is going to find the going a lot tougher in 2017. This is a perfectly respectable view, and one held by a host of academic, business and City economists. Had the IMF stuck to this sort of assessment throughout the referendum campaign, it would have saved itself embarrassment now. As it is, it will get some stick from those who thought the Washington-based fund had overstepped the mark in its support for the remain camp. The IMF singles out the UK\u2019s referendum as a key factor hurting global growth, saying: \u201cThere is a more subdued outlook for advanced economies following the June U.K. vote in favour of leaving the European Union (Brexit) and weaker-than-expected growth in the United States. These developments have put further downward pressure on global interest rates, as monetary policy is now expected to remain accommodative for longer. It also cites China\u2019s economic rebalancing, and a general slowdown in trade growth since 2012. It blames a \u201cwaning pace of trade liberalization and the recent uptick in protectionism\u201d. The full report is online here. Our news story about the IMF\u2019s latest forecasts is here: The IMF has left its overall global growth forecasts unchanged (compared to July), at 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2017. That\u2019s pretty lacklustre in historic terms. The IMF has also taken the scalpel to its forecast for US economic growth. It now expects the world\u2019s largest economy to only expand by 1.6% the year, down from 2.2% back in July. Newsflash! The IMF has announced that Britain will be the fastest growing major economy in 2016, despite the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. In its new report, the Fund predicts UK GDP will grow by 1.8% this year, ahead of the US, Germany, Japan and the other members of the G7. That\u2019s quite a pronouncement, given the Fund has led the chorus of warnings against a Brexit. It does also forecast a sharp slowdown in 2017 \u2013 but not a full-blown recession. From Washington, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The International Monetary has predicted that the UK will be the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial nations this year and accepted that its prediction of a post-Brexit financial crash has proved overly pessimistic. But while the Washington-based IMF said Britain would comfortably avoid recession with growth of 1.8% in 2016, it stuck to its view that the economy would eventually suffer from the shock referendum result and said expansion next year would be just 1.1% - lower than it expected in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. The Fund used its half-yearly world economic outlook to warn not just about the impact of the Brexit vote on the UK and the wider euro zone economies but about the weak growth and uneven division of the fruits of growth that caused 52% of those who voted on 23 June to end Britain\u2019s 43-year membership of the EU. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said: \u201cTaken as a whole, the world economy has moved sideways. Without determined policy action to support economic activity over the short and longer terms, sub-par growth at recent levels risks perpetuating itself\u2014through the negative economic and political forces it is unleashing. And here are the latest forecasts: Heads-up: In 15 minutes, the International Monetary Fund will release its latest assessment of the global economy. The World Economic Outlook will contain new forecasts, which will surely include the impact of the Brexit vote... Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway has created a nice chart of the pound\u2019s value over the centuries (click here to see a larger version). There\u2019s absolutely no love for the pound today. As US traders arrive at work in New York, sterling is still at a 31-year low against the US dollar at just $1.275, down 1 cent or 0.7%. This is a historically bad moment for the pound -- it\u2019s only been weaker in 1985. The unexpected good news that Britain\u2019s construction sector surged in September (details here) hasn\u2019t brought any relief. Investors are focusing on Brexit, and the prospect of a divorce between Britain and the EU by March 2019. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says sterling is suffering from a \u201chorrible combination\u201d of Brexit anxieties and a resurgent Dollar, prompting traders into waves of selling. It seems Theresa May\u2019s sanguine attitude to leaving the European Union while focusing on immigration may have sparked concerns of a potential hard Brexit consequently leaving the Sterling vulnerable to steep losses. Although investors were provided some clarity when March 2017 was the date set to invoking the article 50, the uncertainty over how the Brexit negotiations will take place in the period after continues to haunt investor attraction towards the pound. And there could be worse to come.... It should be kept in mind that the persistent Brexit fears have always had a firm grip on the Sterling with explosive levels of volatility expected in the coming months as anxiety mounts ahead of the article 50 invoke date. George Osborne hasn\u2019t had a lot to cheer about recently, what with being sacked by Theresa May and seeing the central pillar of his economic plan trashed by the new chancellor, Philip Hammond. But there\u2019s one piece of good news for the member for Tatton; his family firm is going to benefit from the slump in the pound. My colleague Simon Bowers has the details: Osborne &amp; Little, the luxury wallpaper chain owned by the family of former chancellor George Osborne, says it expects to benefit from the fall in the value of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. The company said there would be \u201climited impact\u201d in the short term from Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, but if sterling remained weak, it would bring a \u201cmaterial benefit\u201d to the business next year. In the company\u2019s latest accounts, they say that: \u201cIn the short term there will be limited impact resulting from the UK leaving the EU, but if exchange rates stay as they are, in particular, the exchange rate between sterling and the US dollar, then there will be a material benefit in the year ending 31 March 2018.\u201d What a stroke of luck.... Remember the wild hours of 24 June, after Britain voted to leave the European Union? Of course you do. How could anyone forget the prime minister resigning, the pound plunging, and the stock market taking an almighty bath when trading began? But, anyone who had the foresight to buy shares at that moment is sitting on some huge gains. The FTSE 100 is now 20% higher than its worst point on that Friday morning. Higher still and higher goes the FTSE 100. Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index is now above than its record close, 7103.98, recorded in April 2015. It\u2019s now up 126 points, or 1.8%, at 7110, with almost every shares up. But, at the risk of banging on... this is partly due to the slump in the pound (which makes internationally focused companies more valuable in sterling terms). Chuka Umunna MP, Chair of Vote Leave Watch, has seized on the slump in the pound to berate the leaders of the Brexit campaign. In a resounding blast, Umunna says: \u201cLeave campaigners promised that the economy would be unaffected by a vote to leave the EU. They dismissed every economic warning as \u2018scaremongering\u2019 or \u2018Project Fear\u2019. \u201cToday we see how hollow their assertions were. This collapse in the value of the pound means ordinary British workers will be worse off, as prices in the shops soar and the pound in everyone\u2019s pocket is worth less. \u201cThe Tory conference in Birmingham reveals three cabinet members responsible for Brexit \u2013 Davis, Fox and Johnson \u2013 blind to the damage Brexit is already doing to Britain. Instead of rushing to pull out of the Single Market, they should focus on limiting the damage to our economy and maintaining as many of the current benefits we enjoy as possible.\u201d Umunna is absolutely right that the weak pound is pushing up the cost of imports; both finished goods and raw materials. Some technology companies began hiking prices immediately after the referendum. Consumer goods group Unilever warned in August that prices will be pushed higher; it makes Dove Soap, icecream, biscuits and Flora. Even bacon from China could become more expensive too. But other companies say they hope to \u2018absorb\u2019 these costs, rather than pushing up prices. For example, baking firm Greggs said today it will do its \u201cabsolute utmost\u201d to avoid price rises. The uncertainty swirling around the Brexit issue has forced the Irish government to cut its growth forecasts. Reuters has the story: Ireland on Tuesday cut its gross domestic product forecast for 2017 on concerns about the fall-out from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and said risks were centered \u201cfirmly to the downside.\u201d The finance ministry cut its 2016 GDP forecast to 4.2 percent from 4.9 percent and for 2017 to 3.5% from 3.9% and said there was considerable uncertainty to the outlook for next year with the impact of Brexit still unfolding. \u201cWe have reduced next year\u2019s forecast by around half a percentage point to take into account the uncertainty associated with Brexit,\u201d John McCarthy, the finance ministry\u2019s chief economist, told a parliamentary committee. Around 40% of Ireland\u2019s food and drink exports are sold to the UK, in an example of the close trade links between the two countries. Dublin is particularly anxious about the prospect of the UK leaving the EU customs union without any new trade agreement. The future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is another obvious issue -- leading to calls today for a new agreement to prevent a \u2018hard border\u2019 being established. Time for some history: a market report from the last time the pound was worth just $1.27. Health worries about a senior US politician? An Argentinian debt crisis? Concern about the oil price? Plus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose.... Mining companies and internationally-focused firms have been the best performing companies on the London stock market this year, as this chart shows: It was sent over by Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. He reckons the market could still go higher. With cash and bonds yielding next to nothing, equities are the natural alternative for anyone looking for a decent level of income. Nor will there be any shortage of income-seekers at the moment, as millions of baby boomers are reaching retirement age, while the recent pension freedoms conveniently allow them to park their retirement funds in the stock market rather than buying an annuity. And on some measures, shares aren\u2019t actually too expensive today, he adds: If you compare share prices to company earnings, the valuation of the UK stock market is actually somewhere in the middle of its historic range, neither particularly cheap, nor dear, at current prices. This is in stark contrast to the former peak of the market in 1999, when the price-earnings ratio of the UK stock market stood at an eye-watering level. The City isn\u2019t going to get any special treatment in the Brexit negotiations, according to a new report that has alarmed some investors. Bloomberg is reporting that PM Theresa May wants to \u201cchange the relationship between the government and the City of London\u201d. According to three senior figures in May\u2019s administration, the government will refuse to prioritize the protection of the sector after the U.K. has left the European Union. Her team has also dismissed the key business demand for an interim deal with the EU to help ease the transition out of the bloc, one of the people said. All asked not to be named because the information is sensitive. Here\u2019s the full piece: Banks to Miss Out on Special Favors in May\u2019s Brexit Plans The City fears a hard Brexit because it could prevent firms in London from offering services across the European Union. Those \u2018passporting rights\u2019 are highly prized, but would be lost if Britain leaves the single market in 2019. This uncertainty is already making it harder for City firms to plan, or hire new staff. Tom Stevenson, director of personal investing for Fidelity International, suggests the London stock market could easily keep climbing, despite the clouds of Brexit uncertainty. \u201cAs the pound plunges to a three decade low, the FTSE 100 has broken through the 7000 barrier, reaching 7,076 this morning, close to its highest ever. The first time the FTSE surpassed this milestone was in March 2015 before rising to its all-time intra-day high of 7,122 in April 2015. Since then we have seen the markets fluctuate, hitting a low in February 2016 of 5,499, before bouncing back again \u2013 an increase of 28.6 per cent. \u201cThis is obviously good news for UK investors and no-one would complain about the market finally moving decisively on from its 1999 dot.com bubble peak. But it should be remembered that the main reason shares are rising today is the remarkable slide in the pound to its lowest level since 1985. It\u2019s good for UK exporters and overseas earners but for foreign stock market investors it takes the edge off the latest gains. \u201cCan the market go further from here? Despite coming close to a new high, the valuation of the UK market is not excessive and investors still look to shares for income, growth and stability. London\u2019s stock market is surging higher, sending the FTSE 100 index up by 100 points to a new 16-month high. Shares in consumer group Unilever, drinks company Diageo, and food group Compass have all hit record highs. And the Footsie is now hovering around 7084 points, only 38 points shy of its record high. Nearly ever share is up. We shouldn\u2019t forget the proviso that this is partly due to the weakness of the pound (which boosts the share prices of companies with international earnings, as explained earlier). But investors may also be showing some confidence in Britain\u2019s prospects; especially after this morning\u2019s strong data from the building sector. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at City firm IG, explains: There may be no shortage of commentators pointing out that the index is still down in dollar terms, but with the index at its highest level in over a year there is a distinct feel-good factor among UK investors. European markets are joining in the party, with Deutsche Bank shares resilient despite no developments on a potential reduction in the DoJ fine. The traditionally strong quarter for equities has got off to a remarkably good start, although the move has probably been helped by the lack of heavyweight data so far this month. Today\u2019s UK construction PMI continues the trend set by manufacturing yesterday, although with so much focus still on the UK\u2019s path to Brexit the relief for sterling has been minimal. If tomorrow\u2019s services number also comes in strongly the Bank of England is going to have a hard time justifying another cut in interest rates. The resurgence in Britain\u2019s construction sector hasn\u2019t done the pound much good. Sterling is still ploughing 31-year lows this morning, trading at $1.2771 against the US dollar and 87.4p against the euro. Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, says: \u201cThis is a clear signal that the fears for a hard Brexit are becoming bigger day by day and that also the limitation of the freedom of movement is taking the investors away from the pound.\u201d Here\u2019s some expert reaction to Britain\u2019s construction sector surging back to growth in September: Tim Moore, Senior Economist at IHS Markit: \u201cResilient housing market conditions and a renewed upturn in civil engineering activity helped to drive an overall improvement in construction output volumes for the first time since the EU referendum. \u201cA number of survey respondents noted that Brexit- related anxiety has receded among clients, although it remained a factor behind the ongoing decline in commercial building work. Mike Chappell, Global Corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking \u201cFar from being overwhelmingly downbeat, many construction firms, particularly those at the larger end of the market, have indicated that the EU referendum result has \u2013 so far at least \u2013 had little impact on business. \u201cThe industry has also been buoyed by the Government\u2019s decision to press ahead with Hinkley Point, one of the most significant infrastructure projects of recent decades. Even if not all in the sector will share in the spoils, the move suggests a commitment to infrastructure, underlined by encouraging comments from the chancellor at the Conservative Party conference. Other major projects, such as HS2 and the airport expansion in the South East, are also in the pipeline. \u201cOn the other side of the coin, the weakness of sterling continues to make raw materials more expensive for those without relevant hedging and the expectation of many is that inflation is set to become more of a headache during 2017.\u201d Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, said: \u201cConstruction is sitting in the eye of the storm. The sector has yet to feel the full brunt of Brexit as a healthy pipeline of work will carry companies through the next 12 to 18 months. Triggering Article 50 is likely to spark a significant change, and encouraging indicators could be false positives. \u201cThe Government has an opportunity in the Autumn Statement to strengthen the commitment to infrastructure spending. Projects like Hinckley Point, together with smaller scale developments to keep the economy moving, will be on the wish list of a sector that needs more prospects on its horizon.\u201d Some snap analysis: Boom! Britain\u2019s building sector had surged back to growth, new data shows. In the latest sign that the Brexit vote has not hurt the economy, the monthly construction PMI has leapt to 52.3 in September, up from 49.2 in August. That\u2019s much stronger than expected. It means activity in the sector increased last month, at the fastest rate since March (any reading over 50 = shows growth). Markit, which compiles the report, says that residential housebuilding drove the recovery. There was also a welcome pick-up in new orders, after four months of \u201csustained decline\u201d The PMI, or purchasing managers index, measures activity, new orders, and confidence in the sector. More to follow... The important point about today\u2019s selloff is that the pound has slumped below its lowest point after the EU referendum. That strongly suggests that traders have been unsettled by the prospect of Britain leaving the EU, and the single market, as early as March 2019. By falling through July\u2019s lows, the pound is now at levels only seen during the sterling crisis of 1985. Back then, the world was struggling to cope with a particularly strong US dollar, as America\u2019s central bank held interest rates high to tackle inflation (which encouraged traders to hold dollars). Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale also blames the Conservative Party for sending pound down to levels last seen in 1985. Confirmation that the UK Government plans to trigger article 50 by the end of Q1 2017 hit sterling harder than I expected yesterday, which is saying something. Some sort of a bounce is possible today but the noises from the Conservative party conference aren\u2019t helpful. There will be fiscal slippage as the Chancellor won\u2019t try to hit previous deficit reduction targets, but a significant easing is not on the cards. Nor is the government showing any signs of shifting a position where control on immigration is the hardest of lines in negotiations to leave the EU, and won\u2019t be sacrificed or watered down in order to keep access to the single market, particularly for financial services. There\u2019s nothing there to soften the outlook for sterling, at all. Ana Thaker, Market Economist at PhillipCapital UK, believes the pound could slump to $1.25, or worse, as exit talks with the European Union get underway. She says: There is great uncertainty regarding how the Brexit negotiations will take shape and this could see a renewed bout of volatility in the currency. The Bank of England could also seek to stabilise markets if volatility continues but it remains to be seen how far Sterling could drop with the $1.25 being the next target level; whilst it could dip lower than this, there is likely to have to be significant developments for the pair to reach the $1.20 level. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies has hit a new record high! That\u2019s significant, as the index is seen as more representative of the UK economy than the heavyweight FTSE 100. Hats off to Bloomberg for this chart, which shows how the London stock market rally is partly due to the drop in the pound since 23 June. The light blue line is the FTSE 100 - hitting a new 16-month high this morning. The purple line is the pound, plunging to 31-year lows. The white line is the FTSE 100 priced in dollars (and still below the pre-referendum levels) And the orange line is EU referendum day. The prospect of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 is hurting the pound, says Conner Campbell of SpreadEx: It seems that it is going to be hard to provide a tourniquet for sterling\u2019s recent wounds given the solidity of the newly announced Brexit timeline (with March set to go down in the history books as when Article 50 was triggered), and the firmness with which May stated her intention to chase border control even if it means relinquishing Britain\u2019s position in the single market. Today\u2019s selloff is reinforcing the pound\u2019s claim to be the worst-performing major currency of 2016. This chart shows how the pound has weakened sharply against all its major rivals: While the pound slides, shares are soaring in London. The FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip companies bounced excitedly over the 7,000 point mark at the start of trading, to a new-16-month high. It\u2019s up 52 points to 7040, up 0.85%, as money pours into shares. BUT.... before anyone gets excited, it\u2019s important to note that this is partly due to the pound\u2019s weakness. The Footsie is packed with internationally-focused firms, whose overseas earnings are worth more when the pound is lower. And if you price the FTSE in dollars, not pounds, it\u2019s certainly not at a 16-month high.... Bloomberg says \u201cBrexit angst\u201d is hurting the pound: The pound dropped to a three-decade low, as investor concern about Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union welled up after Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s announcement that she would begin the process of leaving the bloc in the first quarter of 2017. Sterling fell beyond its post-Brexit-vote low, and was down against 29 of its 31 major peers. During the first day of the Conservative Party\u2019s annual conference in Birmingham on Sunday, May promised to curb immigration and set a date for Britain to trigger Article 50, which starts a two-year withdrawal process. Newsflash: the pound has hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar. It has shed 0.5% in early trading in London, dropping to $1.2778. That\u2019s its lowest level since June 1985, and almost 15% weaker than before the EU referendum on 23 June. The pound has also ploughed to a new three-year low against the euro, at 87.51p. Sterling has been under pressure since UK government announced on Sunday it would trigger the process of leaving the European Union by the end of March 2017. City investors are also concerned that Britain appears to be on track to leave the EU single market, as it places a priority on restricting immigration into the UK. Currency expert Kathleen Brooks, of FOREX.com and City Index, pins the blame on events at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham. The Tory party conference is turning into a sell for the pound, as FX traders get spooked by May\u2019s apparent sanguine attitude to leaving the single market, preferring to focus on immigration and UK sovereignty rather than the economic fallout of Brexit. Phillip Hammond, the UK\u2019s new Chancellor, didn\u2019t help the pound either when he suggested that George Osborne\u2019s fiscal rules will be abandoned and government spending increased. This is designed to cushion some of the blow from the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union. However, it is likely to weigh on the UK\u2019s already large budget deficit, which is another blow to the pound at the start of the new quarter. More reaction to follow! Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The health of Britain\u2019s economy will probably dominate the agenda today, as the UK faces up to the prospect of exiting the EU by spring 2019. For starters, we get a new health check on Britain\u2019s construction sector, at 9.30am BST. Economists predict that activity in the building industry contracted a little in September, as the sector\u2019s recession continued. CMC Market\u2019s Michael Hewson says: The construction sector has been a significant underperformer in the last three to four months, posting sub 50 readings every month since June. Expectations are for a reading of 49.1, slightly down from 49.2 in August. Yesterday, though, we got some extremely decent manufacturing data - showing the biggest surge in two years. So a surprise can\u2019t be ruled out. The big news comes at 2pm BST, though, when the International Monetary Fund publishes its latest assessment of the global economy. This will be the first World Economic Outlook since the Brexit vote in June, so it will be fascinating to see the IMF\u2019s view today. Back in June, they warned that Britain would lurch into recession if it voted to leave the EU; obviously its early days, but the economy does seem to be coping OK so far. It\u2019s not all about the UK, though. Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank remains under pressure to agree a fine for mis-selling mortgage backed securities. Its shares will reopen at 8am, after a Monday holiday in Frankfurt... We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Everybody gets it wrong from time to time. Only the inveterate fence sitters are spared having egg on their face.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund certainly knows what it is like to make a mistake. In the run-up to the EU referendum, the IMF made a series of interventions warning voters of the dire consequences that would follow a vote to leave.</p> <p>At first, the IMF stuck to long-term forecasts, saying investment and trade would eventually be weaker if the UK divorced from the other 27 members of the EU. But as the referendum neared and the vote was on a knife-edge, the warnings became more lurid. The UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum\">would immediately start sliding into recession</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\">House prices would crumble. Shares would crash</a>.</p> <p>So what do you do if your forecasts turn out to be a little wide of the mark? Either you put your hands up and admit you were wrong. Or you brazen it out. You say that it is too early to say. You say that eventually you will come right.</p> <p>No prizes for guessing which option the IMF has taken. Its half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) report says the UK will do fine in 2016 but is going to find the going a lot tougher in 2017.</p> <p>This is a perfectly respectable view, and one held by a host of academic, business and City economists. Had the IMF stuck to this sort of assessment throughout the referendum campaign, it would have saved itself embarrassment now. As it is, it will get some stick from those who thought the Washington-based fund had overstepped the mark in its support for the remain camp.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/imf-peak-pessimism-brexit-eu-referendum-european-union-international-monetary-fund\">IMF left shamefaced after peak pessimism over Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f3ac35e4b0d3973ef5f809\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T13:21:24.999Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF singles out the UK\u2019s referendum as a key factor hurting global growth, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere is a more subdued outlook for advanced economies following the June U.K. vote in favour of leaving the European Union (Brexit) and weaker-than-expected growth in the United States.</p> <p>These developments have put further downward pressure on global interest rates, as monetary policy is now expected to remain accommodative for longer.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also cites China\u2019s economic rebalancing, and a general slowdown in trade growth since 2012.

The International Monetary Fund certainly knows what it is like to make a mistake. In the run-up to the EU referendum, the IMF made a series of interventions warning voters of the dire consequences that would follow a vote to leave. At first, the IMF stuck to long-term forecasts, saying investment and trade would eventually be weaker if the UK divorced from the other 27 members of the EU. But as the referendum neared and the vote was on a knife-edge, the warnings became more lurid. The UK would immediately start sliding into recession. House prices would crumble. Shares would crash. So what do you do if your forecasts turn out to be a little wide of the mark? Either you put your hands up and admit you were wrong. Or you brazen it out. You say that it is too early to say. You say that eventually you will come right. No prizes for guessing which option the IMF has taken. Its half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) report says the UK will do fine in 2016 but is going to find the going a lot tougher in 2017. This is a perfectly respectable view, and one held by a host of academic, business and City economists. Had the IMF stuck to this sort of assessment throughout the referendum campaign, it would have saved itself embarrassment now. As it is, it will get some stick from those who thought the Washington-based fund had overstepped the mark in its support for the remain camp. Sadly, the furore over the IMF\u2019s Brexit predictions may well overshadow the more interesting aspects of the WEO. It is true, for example, that the vote for Brexit was the result of almost a decade of flatlining average incomes since the financial crisis, which has bred hostility towards elites, globalisation and immigrants. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, rightly noted: \u201cSimilar tensions afflict the US political scene, where anti-immigrant and anti-trade rhetoric have been prominent from the start of the current presidential election round. Across the world, protectionist trade measures have been on the rise.\u201d All this is quite true. The IMF identifies \u201cpolitical discord and inward looking policies\u201d as one of the two big risks to its prediction that global growth will increase slightly from 3.1% to 3.4% next year; the others being stagnation in advanced economies. These two factors are, of course, interlinked. If western economies continue to struggle, protectionist pressures are going to rise. They will also make it more likely that the other risks identified by the IMF \u2013 a sharper slowdown in China and financial trouble in the emerging markets \u2013 will crystallise. The solution, the IMF says, is a three-pronged approach rather than the continued reliance on central banks, with their ultra-low interest rates and money creation schemes. Governments have to loosen fiscal policy (cut taxes and increase spending) where there is scope to do so, and reallocate spending towards growth-enhancing sectors where there is not. Finally, there have to be measures aimed at supporting those harmed by economic change, whether as the result of globalisation or technological overhaul, such as stronger welfare nets and more progressive income tax regimes. One explanation for the IMF\u2019s hyperbolic warnings about the immediate impact of the Brexit vote is that it thought the expected remain vote would mean they would never have to be justified. Now that it has, the IMF is terrified because it sees the UK referendum as symptomatic of something deeply dysfunctional about the global economy it has helped to shape in the past four decades.

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has predicted the UK will be the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial countries this year and accepted that its prediction of a post-Brexit-vote financial crash has proved to be overly pessimistic. But while the Washington-based IMF said Britain would have a \u201csoft landing\u201d in 2016 with growth of 1.8%, it stuck to its view that the economy would eventually suffer from the shock EU referendum result and said expansion next year would be just 1.1% \u2013 lower than it expected in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said the fund had been right to warn about the risks of Brexit but added: \u201cWe are looking at a soft landing for 2016. We are happy about the outcome.\u201d Looking further ahead, Obstfeld said the uncertainty about the divorce settlement between Britain and the EU would make businesses more cautious and warned that the fall in sterling \u2013 which hit a 31-year low on Tuesday \u2013 would hit living standards. The pound sank to $1.274, its lowest level since June 1985. However, the decline provided another boost to companies with sales in dollars and the FTSE-100 soared 90 points to 7074 - its highest close since April 2015\u2019s record high of 7104. The FTSE 100 index is now up nearly 28% since February and has climbed 12% since referendum day on 23 June. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said the UK economy had shown its resilience since the referendum but there was no room for complacency. \u201cThere are still challenges ahead, as the IMF note in their estimate for growth in 2017. That is why I stand ready to take action to support our economy through any period of turbulence and will continue to pursue the long-term goals of fiscal consolidation and improved productivity.\u201d The IMF used its half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) to warn not just about the impact of the referendum result on the UK and the wider eurozone economies, as well as the weak growth and uneven division of the fruits of growth that caused 52% of those who votedto end Britain\u2019s 43-year membership of the EU. Obstfeld said: \u201cTaken as a whole, the world economy has moved sideways. Without determined policy action to support economic activity over the short and longer terms, sub-par growth at recent levels risks perpetuating itself through the negative economic and political forces it is unleashing.\u201d He said slow growth and rising inequality was having a political impact: \u201cThe slow and incomplete recovery from crisis has been especially damaging in those countries where the distribution of income has continued to skew sharply toward the highest earners, leaving little room for those with lower incomes to advance. \u201cThe result in some richer countries has been a political movement that blames globalisation for all woes and seeks somehow to wall off the economy from global trends rather than engage cooperatively with foreign nations. Brexit is only one example of this tendency.\u201d The WEO predicted global growth of 3.1% this year, slightly lower than the 3.2% recorded in 2015. It expects a modest acceleration to 3.4% in 2017. Obstfeld said the Brexit vote left unclear the future shape of the UK\u2019s trade and financial relations with the other 27 EU member states, with a likely impact on investment and hiring across Europe. \u201cAlongside economic anxiety and other factors, the Brexit vote reflects a resentment of cross-border migration that has fuelled nationalist sentiment in Europe and called into question the way forward for EU integration,\u201d Obstfeld said. \u201cSimilar tensions afflict the US political scene, where anti-immigrant and anti-trade rhetoric have been prominent from the start of the current presidential election round. Across the world, protectionist trade measures have been on the rise.\u201d Apart from the sharp depreciation of the pound, the IMF said financial markets\u2019 reaction to Brexit vote had \u201cgenerally been contained\u201d, with shares up and the appetite for taking risk recovering after an initial plunge. The WEO noted that manufacturing in the UK had bounced back after falling steeply in July and spending in the shops had held up. But it cautioned that economic data since the referendum had been limited and said the fall in sterling would prompt inflation to rise from 0.7% this year to 2.5% in 2017. \u201cIn the United Kingdom, slower growth is expected since the referendum as uncertainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote weighs on firms\u2019 investment and hiring decisions and consumers\u2019 purchases of durable goods and housing. Growth is forecast at 1.8% in 2016 and 1.1% in 2017, based on the assumptions of smooth post-Brexit negotiations and a limited increase in economic barriers.\u201d The IMF cut its medium-term growth forecast for the UK from 2.1% to 1.9% as a result of what it assumes will be barriers to trade, migration and capital flow. The IMF also backed Hammond\u2019s hints of extra government spending for public investment in next month\u2019s autumn statement. Noting that the Bank of England\u2019s package of measures in August was aimed at boosting confidence and limiting the downside risks to the economy, the IMF said: \u201cAs greater clarity emerges on the macroeconomic impact of the Brexit vote, the need for further near-term discretionary fiscal policy easing and the appropriateness of the medium-term deficit target should be assessed, possibly in the context of the forthcoming November fiscal review.\u201d",

The company said there would be \u201climited impact\u201d in the short term from Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, but if sterling remained weak, it would bring a \u201cmaterial benefit\u201d to the business next year. The comments, made in the company\u2019s latest accounts, will make uncomfortable reading for Osborne, who delivered a series of dark predictions about the likely impact of Brexit on UK companies before the referendum in June. He said departure from the EU would be a \u201cmost extraordinary self-inflicted wound\u201d, would leave Britain \u201cpermanently poorer\u201d, and plunge the country into immediate recession, requiring emergency budget measures. The Osborne &amp; Little board said: \u201cIn the short term there will be limited impact resulting from the UK leaving the EU, but if exchange rates stay as they are, in particular, the exchange rate between sterling and the US dollar, then there will be a material benefit in the year ending 31 March 2018.\u201d This will be a welcome boost for the company, which reported sales of \u00a332.8m, down 4% for the year to March 2016. North America is the company\u2019s largest market, accounting for \u00a315.8m of sales. The company said sales in the US were down 9% in local currency during the year, but only 2% lower when converted into pound sterling. The further sharp weakening in the pound, which tumbled to a 31-year low against the dollar on Tuesday, is expected to provide a major boost. \u201cThe majority of the US \u2026 turnover is sourced by exports from the UK parent company,\u201d the accounts stated. They added that Osborne &amp; Little took measures to reduce exposure to currency fluctuations but this was only in the near term.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On a day when leading shares are surging ahead, mainly due to the pound tumbling to a new 31 year low and boosting exporters, AstraZeneca is heading in the other direction. Its shares are down 21p at \u00a350.20 after it said its heart drug Brilinta had failed to help patients with circulatory problems in their legs, showing no benefits over an older blood thinning treatment, Sanofi\u2019s Plavix. So AstraZeneca is less certain of a $3.5bn a year sales target for Brilinta by 2023. Ludovic Helfgott, head of the Brilinta business, told Reuters: We don\u2019t believe the goal of $3.5bn is attainable. I think it would be unrealistic to believe that. Liberum analysts said: This was a study designed to evaluate whether Brilinta offered benefit over Plavix in a new indication, peripheral artery disease, but the result was negative (no benefit over and above Plavix). No impact on existing indications. We had only around $200m in our numbers for this indication by 2021 anyway so the impact on earnings is small for us (less than 1%) although others may have been more optimistic. We also believe AstraZeneca was expecting contribution from this indication in order to get to the Brilinta peak sales target outlined at the time of the Pfizer bid and expect the stock to underperform today on this negative news. Meanwhile Cantor Fitzgerald said: The announcement that Brilinta has failed to meet primary end point in the EUCLID trial of benefit over Plavix (clopidogrel) in symptomatic peripheral artery disease is clearly a disappointment as the company looks to flesh out the Brilinta prescribing label post ACS [acute coronary syndrome]; striving to mimic the breadth of indications enjoyed by Plavix (clopidogrel). That being said we continue to forecast Brilinta sales in excess of $1bn this year and maintain our +$2bn sales target for 2018 reflecting its strong position ahead of Plavix in the more important ACS indication.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have broken through the 7000 barrier for the first time since May 2015 as a plunge in the pound to a new 31 year low boosts the exporter-heavy FTSE 100. Banking shares are also receiving some support from a revival in Deutsche Bank. After a market holiday in Germany on Monday, the bank\u2019s shares have reopened up 2.55% on hopes that it will not have to pay as much as the $14bn demanded by the US Department of Justice in fines related to mortgage mis-selling. So Standard Chartered is up 17.3p at 651.5p, Barclays is 2.1p better at 170.3p and Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 2.3p to 181.6p. But the biggest riser in the leading index is Pearson, up more than 6% to 811p as analysts at Morgan Stanley dismissed suggestions the education specialist could issue a profit warning: Down 25% from its highs and with an around 10% 2018 free cashflow yield versus a PE of 10 times the market is expecting another profits warning. We don\u2019t think Pearson will warn, meaning the shares could recover sharply on the third quarter results. In more detail the bank spelled out why it thinks Pearson shares are too cheap: (i) Pearson cut market expectations by \u00a335m-\u00a375m pre restructuring (and \u00a3355m-\u00a3395m post restructuring) in January. This covers a multitude of sins. (ii) Pearson\u2019s EBITA forecasts have a lot of flex allowing, for instance, an increase of \u00a3110m in incentive compensation in 2016 \u2013 18% of expected EBITA. (iii) Pearson strongly reiterated its 2016-18 guidance at the first half figures and has not rescinded it in subsequent public appearances, the most recent being September 21. (iv) There is better trading elsewhere at Pearson with good growth in the digital businesses and better than expected contract wins in Assessment. v) 2017 is an inevitable upswing year in US schools with a better environment in US Higher Education (enrolments close to flat) and US and UK assessment. (vi) With 66% of sales in the US and sub 10% in the UK, Pearson is a play on Brexit nervousness. (vii) We think Pearson won\u2019t warn at the third quarter (end October), the peak trading period. Given the underperformance, low rating and big dividend yield \u2013 almost 7% \u2013 we think the shares will bounce strongly on this. Testing equipment group Intertek has also received some broker support. Its shares have jumped 166p to \u00a337.08 after Jefferies raised its recommendation from underperform to buy on the basis of strong growth and possible acquisition activity: Our analysis of margin levers provides a strong case for profit growth faster than revenues, while strong free cashflow allows us to now formally model M&amp;A. We upgrade 2017 earnings per share by 10% of which 6% is underlying. Growth and margins in the main division - Products - look well supported by secular drivers. Double upgrade to buy. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 88.30 points at 7071.82, with UK construction data also giving some support by coming in stronger than expected. The pound\u2019s new slide comes after UK prime minister Theresa May set the clock ticking on Brexit negotiations, and suggested the focus would be on immigration controls rather than the single market. Financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: It seems that it is going to be hard to provide a tourniquet for sterling\u2019s recent wounds given the solidity of the newly announced Brexit timeline (with March set to go down in the history books as when Article 50 was triggered), and the firmness with which May stated her intention to chase border control even if it means relinquishing Britain\u2019s position in the single market. Domestic focussed stocks and defensive shares were under pressure, with Marks &amp; Spencer down 2.2p at 323.8p and National Grid 2.5p lower at 1099.5p. Among the mid-caps Henderson Group is down 5.3p at 265.4p after Monday\u2019s surge in the wake of its proposed merger with Janus Capital, but specialist lender Onesavings has added 15.3p to 284p after Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight with a price target lifted from 235p to 340p. Continuing merger hopes among the mid-caps have helped the FTSE 250 soar to a new peak, up 1.6% to 18,474.70. Ian Williams, economist at Peel Hunt, told Reuters: There\u2019s quite a big chunk of globally diverse companies in that group [the FTSE 250] as well, and an agreed takeover bid for one of its constituents has helped... For foreign investors who are looking at sterling-denominated assets, they are continuing to get a bit cheaper.",

Breakfast offers \u2013 including a popular \u00a32 bap and coffee meal deal \u2013 were among the fastest growing parts of Greggs\u2019 business, the chief executive said. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept the breakfast deal at \u00a32 for six years now. That\u2019s less than the price for just a coffee in a lot of other places,\u201d Roger Whiteside said. The high street chain, best known for its sausage roll and pasties, said its low calorie \u201cbalanced choice\u201d products, introduced two and a half years ago, were also doing well and represented more than 10% of sales. The group said the growth in sales, on a like-for-like basis, had slowed to 2.8% during the 13 weeks to 1 October, down from 4.9% in the same period last year. After including new stores, however, sales were up 5.6%, and Whiteside said the group was confident of meeting City expectations for full-year profits. Analysts forecast the group would unveil pre-tax profits of \u00a376m. Whiteside hopes the chain\u2019s new Mexican flavours, including chipotle pulled beef and fiery pulled chicken and available in stores from Tuesday, will prove a popular addition this winter. \u201cPulled anything seems to work, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. Asked if the group would ever abandon the sale of loaves of bread, Whiteside said: \u201cIt used to be what the business sold back in the 1930s, and bread still features [in stores in more residential areas] but it has been declining for seven decades. If the trend continues it will reach a point where it is no longer worth selling. Basically, people buy bread in supermarkets now.\u201d Greggs expects to make \u00a320m from the sale of its bakery in Twickenham, west London, which will close next month. Production will move to a new distribution centre in Enfield, north London. Greggs has opened 103 stores this year, many of them in the south of England, and closed 58. It trades from 1,743 shops, including 143 franchised outlets. Shares in the bakery chain were up 5p at 1051p in early trading on Tuesday.",

As Franklin D Roosevelt, the then president and architect of the New Deal, told the American people: \u201cWe are going to make a country in which no one is left out.\u201d More than 80 years later, that phrase echoes in the words of Theresa May, who set out her stall in June to shape a country that \u201cworks for everyone\u201d. Political rhetoric for a new economic imperative. To thrive outside the EU, the UK needs to come together. No one left behind. Research that Grant Thornton undertook with the Centre for Economics and Business Research shows the possible benefit of this: untapped business potential could generate an additional \u00a3479bn for the UK economy by 2025. We know that article 50 will be triggered by the end of March 2017, but the long-term commercial landscape that will make up post-Brexit Britain is still unclear. What is evident is that our society needs to be more cohesive, our economy more inclusive and our institutions more representative. We need to stimulate ideas and actions that can create a truly vibrant economy that realises the shared potential of businesses, cities, people and communities across the UK. Not just economic success, but an economy that has people and places at the heart of our thinking. For a British new deal to make a difference, it needs to blend policies that pursue economic regeneration with positive social action. It must give rise to a system where everyone can aspire to build a great life. A new deal for a new Britain. The Brexit vote was a stark reminder that millions of people across the country feel voiceless. The EU referendum result gave an indelible map of the areas in the UK that feel most disengaged. This is overlaid with economic reality: research from the Fabian Society found that those in areas of relatively higher public spending were more likely to vote remain. Bridging this great divide needs to be based on resolving regional funding inequalities, as well as pursuing a grand vision of the kind that Roosevelt gave to the American people: to build a great life. We need to turn each of our major cities into the cogs around which growth, innovation and inclusion can turn. This starts with developing effective policies, bred out of local knowledge and expertise. Eschewing politicians and civil servants hidden away in Westminster and Whitehall, often naive to the world beyond the metropolitan bubble. Outside the EU, the UK must claim a new place in the world \u2013 innovation Britain. But this will only be attained if diversity of thought can rise to the top. It is time to wholly reject the tunnel vision approach that stubbornly lingers in certain British policymaking and business circles. Economic and social policy have to be married together, not just to spur innovation, but face down the UK\u2019s complicated issues. Neither world can hope to go it alone. The responses to the societal and economic divisions that the Brexit vote laid bare cannot rest solely on the shoulders of government. Instead, it calls for collaboration, where the private, public and third sectors work together. That means pooling resources, expertise and ideas, refusing to work in silos, defining key challenges and opportunities together and co-creating a blueprint for positive change. That is why we have launched the Vibrant Economy Commission, a group of cross-sector leaders who will work with people and organisations across the UK to focus on the resolution of major issues, from health to housing, trust to trade and regulation to regional growth. Speaking at the Conservative party conference on Sunday, May said \u201cWe know that the referendum was not a vote to turn in on ourselves, to cut ourselves off from the world.\u201d The confidence and optimism displayed by the prime minister for the UK\u2019s future international role must be applied to domestic affairs. So, let\u2019s start at home and begin with those places that feel most detached from the rest of the country. Working in partnership to capitalise on the great things happening in the UK\u2019s cities and communities, we can develop a Britain that better serves its people. If we fail to act, disengagement will fester and the gap between the haves and have-nots will continue to widen. A collision of ideas and ambitious collaboration that brings us together must be the guiding lights for Britain. Our future must be shaped by vibrant businesses, policymakers and civil society. Government should not and cannot be allowed to forge it alone. It is an optimistic vision, but optimism is what we need. As we learned from the US, dreaming big makes for a bright future.

      "bodyText": "The release of the latest job vacancy figures were a mix of good and bad news. They highlight yet again how the fight to get work depends very much upon where you live, and that the fight for work is likely to continue to be easiest for those seeking to work part-time. In the August quarter, the number of job vacancies rose \u2013 up 2,200 to 175,300. This was the 12th consecutive quarter of the number increasing \u2013 one of the best runs ever seen since the ABS began collecting the data in May 1979. Only the 13 consecutive quarters of increasing job vacancies after the 1990 recession is longer. And while the total number of vacancies remains below the heights seen in 2011, it remains a very healthy number of jobs available for those looking for work: Of course, total job vacancies by itself can be a bit misleading. That\u2019s why economists look at the \u201cjob vacancy rate\u201d \u2013 the number of vacancies as a percentage of the labour force: At 1.38%, the vacancy rate is also quite healthy, if perhaps not as healthy as you would expect it to be given the number of vacancies. And this is where the bad news starts. Economists look at the vacancy rate because there is a pretty good relationship between it and the unemployment rate. As a general rule, the higher the vacancy rate, the lower the unemployment rate \u2013 this is because if more businesses are looking for workers, it is easier for unemployed to find work. It is a relationship that has held up quite well over the past 25 years in Australia. But right now given the relatively strong vacancy rate, you would expect the unemployment rate to be lower than it is \u2013 somewhere around 5.2%. In the past, with a vacancy rate of 1.38% or better, the unemployment rate has never been higher than 5.4%, yet right now it is 5.7%. That is a concern because it suggests that for some reason workers are finding it tougher to get work than in the past. This might be because the jobs are in places where the unemployed are not, or that the unemployed lack the skills required for the jobs that are available, or it might be that the type of work available is not enough to stop people looking for more work \u2013 ie because even though they have a part-time job they are still actively looking for work. One consequence of this is that currently there is slightly more unemployed per job vacancy than you would expect given the job vacancy rate: But even amid this there is still good news. The 4.1 unemployed per vacancy is the lowest since the end of 2012. That good news is tempered somewhat (as all good economic news must be) by the knowledge that job vacancies is a forward-looking indicator. A job vacancy this month often means a job for someone next month (or possibly later). So if job vacancies are growing then employment should also grow. The problem is, while the number of job vacancies is growing, it is doing so at a slower rate than before. This suggests that the current slowing in the growth of employment will likely continue: The breakdown of job vacancies in each state also shows the great differences in economic health across the nation. The growth of vacancies is strongest in New South Wales and Victoria, and weakest is in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland. In terms of fighting for work, the easiest state to be in is NSW, where there are just 3.4 unemployed for every job vacancy. This is just ahead of Victoria\u2019s 4.6: While South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia lag behind NSW and Victoria, the trajectories of the states are quite different. Where Western Australia and Queensland continue to suffer from the drop of mining investment, South Australia is seeing improved growth of vacancies and as a result looking for work in that state has become markedly easier. Two years ago there were over nine unemployed for each vacancy; now it is 6.55: As usual, the most number of job vacancies are in the administration and support industry, closely followed by retail trade. Four of the top five industries with the most number of vacancies also have the highest percentage of part-time workers: Given those industries over the past decade have become even more likely to employ workers part-time, it\u2019s little surprise that underemployment levels are at record heights. The jobs are there, but not so much the hours of work desired. The job vacancy figures are the classic glass half-full/half-empty. It\u2019s good that the number of vacancies continues to grow, but not good that the growth is slowing. It\u2019s good news if you are unemployed in NSW or Victoria; not so good if you live in WA or Queensland and are looking for work. And above all, while it\u2019s good there are jobs out there, it is less good if the work you want or need is full-time work.",
