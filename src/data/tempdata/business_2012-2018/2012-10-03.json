      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund's chief economist has warned that the global economy will take a decade to recover from the financial crisis as the latest snapshot of the UK economy suggested that growth in the third quarter will be at best anaemic. Olivier Blanchard said he feared the eurozone crisis, debt problems in Japan and the US, and a slowdown in China meant that the world economy would not be in good shape until at least 2018. \"It's not yet a lost decade,\" he said. \"But it will surely take at least a decade from the beginning of the crisis for the world economy to get back to decent shape. Blanchard made his comments on a Hungarian website Portfolio.hu ahead of the IMF meeting next week in Tokyo. Germany is expected to defend its handling of Europe's debt problems at the meeting, but Blanchard said there was more that Europe's largest economy could do to support Spain and other struggling eurozone nations. In particular, he urged Berlin to accept a rise in inflation and wages that would make it less competitive with its trading partners. He said there was no risk of hyperinflation in Europe. Higher inflation in Germany, though, would be beneficial: a somewhat higher inflation rate in Germany should simply be seen as a necessary and desirable relative price adjustment, he said. Blanchard's comments came as figures from Markit showed that the UK's important services sector grew in August but slipped back by September as the Olympics factor waned. According to industry figures from Markit the services activity index dropped from 53.7 to 52.2 and employment fell, adding to gloomy surveys of the construction and manufacturing sectors earlier in the week. Markit, which compiles a monthly index based on figures from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said it was now clear that the bounce back from the slump in the first half of the year was weaker than expected and could result in the UK economy growing by just 0.1% in the third quarter. Hopes that the Queen's diamond jubilee and the \u00a39bn spent on the Olympics would lift sales over the longer term have largely been dashed as growth slows and the outlook, though robust with a growing order book, remains subdued. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which began a two-day meeting on Wednesday, is on Thursday expected to keep interest rates at 0.5% and maintain the stock of bonds in its quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn. Most economists believe it is possible the lacklustre figures will persuade the MPC to add a further \u00a350bn at its November meeting when the first estimate of the third quarter figures is available.",

The South Koreans have changed shopping hours, removing \u00a3100m from group profits at a stroke. China is seeing \"weakening consumer demand\". Profits in continental Europe were down by a quarter in the first half as austerity bites. Fresh &amp; Easy in the US clocked up another thumping loss of \u00a374m, barely lower than a year ago. And in the middle of it all sits the enormous UK chain, being hosed with more staff, store revamps and money-off coupons at a cost this year of \u00a31bn. Is there any good news for shareholders within Tesco's first profits decline for 20 years? Doing his best to sound cheerful, chief executive Phil Clarke pointed to a nudge in the sales dial in the UK - on a like-for-like basis, excluding petrol and VAT, this improved by the grand total of 0.1% in the second quarter. OK, a positive figure of any size counts an improvement on the minus 1.5% seen in the first quarter. But, as ever with like-for-like readings, one must remember what they're being compared against. Last year's second quarter was a shocker for Tesco in the UK, so stabilisation against that number counts as a heavily qualified triumph. A clearer picture won't emerge for at least another six months, especially as it is impossible to tell how many punters are shopping at Tesco only because they're being bribed with money-off coupons. If Tesco is truly in revival mode, you'd expect to see some slowing in Sainsbury's steady progress. But Sainsbury's continues to trot along merrily, recording a 1.9% rise in quarterly like-for-like sales in a year in which (unlike Tesco) it expects to maintain its profit margins. In the meantime, Clarke seems determined to torture his shareholders with uncertainty over Fresh &amp; Easy. \"Must do better\" was the gist of his verdict this time, but he's been expressing similar sentiments for the past year. Constraining the supply of capital to Fresh &amp; Easy is a sensible short-term measure but, sooner or later, he'll have to decide whether to stay in the US or flee.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At her first big press conference in 1997, Pearson's new chief executive made a silly promise. Marjorie Scardino said the company's new goal was to achieve double-digit growth in earnings per share every year and to double the share price within five years. \"I think we can do it and I think our shareholders should demand that we do it,\" she declared. Briefly, in the dotcom madness that inflated the value of every media stock, the pledge was fufilled \u2013 indeed, surpassed. The share price actually tripled from Scardino's starting point. Then the reality dawned that FT.com was swallowing an awful lot of cash; worse, Scardino was perceived as having overpaid in her refashioning of the conglomerate. Everybody had understood the logic of shedding some of Pearson's bizarre collection of assets \u2013 such as Madame Tussauds, a half-share of Lazards in the UK and a bit of Channel 5 \u2013 but the march deeper into education in the US had come at a pretty price and delivered mundane initial returns. By 2002, the share price was lower than when she had started. Few would have bet on her surviving another decade at the helm. It took several more years for those education investments to come good and for a Scardino-led Pearson to be recognised as a financial success. Indeed, it's only in the past four years that the share price has really begun to motor. Scardino's final statistics (or statistics with three months to go) look like this: share price up 88% during her time and total shareholder return (share price plus dividends) of 217%. It's a long way short of the excitement imagined in 1997 but a lot has happened in that time. Pearson's TSR performance trumps the 137% for the FTSE 100 index in the same period and puts the miserable 59% for UK media stocks to shame. There's probably two morals there. First, chief executives should never promise a specific share price. Second, even when they do, they're worth keeping if the strategy and the culture is right, as they clearly are at Pearson. Scardino's more-remembered remark, of course, is the one about how the Finacial Times would only be sold \"over my dead body\". That was in 2002, and probably did have the desired effect of giving the hacks at the pink 'un a greater sense of security (at least when they realised Scardino had staying power). But she has also been clear over the years that owning the FT opened doors in places where the Pearson name would receive a shrug of non-recognition \u2013 the Chinese education ministry, for example. Arguably, though, that benefit is not as necessary as it was. When you're now \"the world's leading education company\", which is how Pearson styles itself, maybe you no longer have to use the FT name as a calling card. John Fallon, Scardino's successor, did not put his body on the line on Wednesday, preferring to describe the FT as a \"highly valued and very valuable part of Pearson\". If you were a rich and ambitious company or individual in search of a trophy asset \u2013 Bloomberg, say, or a member of the wealthy Qatari dynasty \u2013 you might want to test what Fallon means.",

However, downside risks to the sector remain. Employment on the index fell for the first time this year, while cost pressures from other inputs such as fuel, food and energy are also concerns for businesses operating in the services sector.</p> <p>The services sector seems to be recovering from the 0.1% contraction recorded in Q2.

With margins squeezed, backlogs of work down for a seventh month and unemployment rising for the last six months, concerns that the German economy would be dragged down by the collapse in demand across the rest of the eurozone appears to be justified.</p> <p>A slump in France shocked economists, who said the fall from 49.2 in August to 45 in September revealed a severe fall in sales and investment. Anything above 50 indicates growth, while a figure below 50 indicates contraction.</p> <p>Spain, meanwhile, saw a fall to 40.2 as companies came to terms with predictions of a recession lasting until at least the end of next year.</p> <p>Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics said the UK is struggling to grow against a background of austerity at home and contraction across the eurozone.</p> <p>\"On the face of it, the headline balance looks consistent with quarterly growth in services output of only 0.2%. The drop in the balance suggests that temporary factors \u2013 including a gain to sectors like hotels and restaurants from the Olympics \u2013 were behind August's unexpected rise,\" he said.</p> <p>\"A weighted average of the three main activity balances of the manufacturing, construction and services surveys is now consistent with flat GDP in the third quarter. Overall, then, it is looking like the rebound in the economy expected in the third quarter is struggling to get any oomph behind it.\"</p> <p>The government is keen to spur growth after a fall in tax revenues and increase in spending on welfare and unemployment benefits hit the public finances. By some estimates the Treasury could miss its deficit reduction targets by as much as \u00a330bn by next April without a turnaround in the economy's fortunes.</p> <p>It will be of great concern that a rise in employment over the last year appears to have come to an end with services companies saying they can continue to grow, albeit at low levels, with fewer staff.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the economy continued to move sideways after two years of virtually no growth.</p> <p>\"GDP is likely to have grown by perhaps 0.1% as modest growth of services activity was offset by a slight drop in construction sector output and a steeper decline in manufacturing.</p> <p>\"Official data are likely to show a stronger GDP rebound, reflecting a technical bounce-back from second quarter weakness arising from extra jubilee holidays, but the purchasing managers' index provides an insight into the underlying trend of the economy, and \u2013 like the British Chambers of Commerce survey \u2013 warns of near stagnation.\"</p> <p>He said the employment situation was also gloomy: \"With the mini-boom in the labour market having now come to an end, it seems inevitable that unemployment will start to rise again.</p> <p>\"Hopes are therefore pinned on the recent upturn in new orders being sufficiently strong and sustained to bring about improved growth of business activity and renewed hiring in coming months.

The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which begins a two-day meeting on Wednesday, is expected to keep interest rates at 0.5% and maintain the stock of bonds in its quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn. However, most economists believe it is possible the lacklustre figures will persuade the MPC to add another \u00a350bn at its November meeting when the first estimate of the third quarter figures are available. Markit said the situation in the UK, though weak, contrasted with steep falls in France and Spain, where the equivalent indexes tumbled. The German services sector also shrank with worrying signs that a contraction over recent months has begun to feed into investment intentions. With margins squeezed, backlogs of work down for a seventh month and unemployment rising for the last six months, concerns that the German economy would be dragged down by the collapse in demand across the rest of the eurozone appears to be justified. A slump in France shocked economists, who said the fall from 49.2 in August to 45 in September revealed a severe fall in sales and investment. Anything above 50 indicates growth, while a figure below 50 indicates contraction. Spain, meanwhile, saw a fall to 40.2 as companies came to terms with predictions of a recession lasting until at least the end of next year. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics said the UK is struggling to grow against a background of austerity at home and contraction across the eurozone. \"On the face of it, the headline balance looks consistent with quarterly growth in services output of only 0.2%. The drop in the balance suggests that temporary factors \u2013 including a gain to sectors like hotels and restaurants from the Olympics \u2013 were behind August's unexpected rise,\" he said. \"A weighted average of the three main activity balances of the manufacturing, construction and services surveys is now consistent with flat GDP in the third quarter. Overall, then, it is looking like the rebound in the economy expected in the third quarter is struggling to get any oomph behind it.\" The government is keen to spur growth after a fall in tax revenues and increase in spending on welfare and unemployment benefits hit the public finances. By some estimates the Treasury could miss its deficit reduction targets by as much as \u00a330bn by next April without a turnaround in the economy's fortunes. It will be of great concern that a rise in employment over the last year appears to have come to an end with services companies saying they can continue to grow, albeit at low levels, with fewer staff. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the economy continued to move sideways after two years of virtually no growth. \"GDP is likely to have grown by perhaps 0.1% as modest growth of services activity was offset by a slight drop in construction sector output and a steeper decline in manufacturing. \"Official data are likely to show a stronger GDP rebound, reflecting a technical bounce-back from second quarter weakness arising from extra jubilee holidays, but the purchasing managers' index provides an insight into the underlying trend of the economy, and \u2013 like the British Chambers of Commerce survey \u2013 warns of near stagnation.\" He said the employment situation was also gloomy: \"With the mini-boom in the labour market having now come to an end, it seems inevitable that unemployment will start to rise again. \"Hopes are therefore pinned on the recent upturn in new orders being sufficiently strong and sustained to bring about improved growth of business activity and renewed hiring in coming months. New orders across all sectors grew at the fastest rate since May, though it is too early to say if this simply reflects a revival after an Olympics-related lull, as indicated by many companies.\"",

It will cost them a fortune.\" Finding out what went wrong is not just a question of adjudicating winners and losers in the blame game. It's a question of analysing the west coast process with enough acuity to ensure that the forthcoming wave of franchise renewals does not fall victim to the same shambles. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, hopes to get the review of the process out of the way by the year end. He is taking a big risk if he thinks that will weed all the problems out of the system and prevent a repeat of the west coast fiasco.",

Independent reviews The transport secretary has ordered two independent reviews to be undertaken urgently: the first into what went wrong with the west coast competition and the lessons to be learned, and the second into the wider DfT rail franchise programme. Meanwhile, he has frozen all other outstanding franchise competitions \u2013 Great Western, Essex Thameside and Thameslink \u2013 pending the independent reviews, which the DfT hopes will ensure future competitions are robust. McLoughlin said: \"I have had to cancel the competition for the running of the west coast franchise because of deeply regrettable and completely unacceptable mistakes made by my department in the way it managed the process. \"A detailed examination by my officials into what happened has revealed these flaws and means it is no longer possible to award a new franchise on the basis of the competition that was held. \"I have ordered two independent reviews to look urgently and thoroughly into the matter so that we know what exactly happened and how we can make sure our rail franchise programme is fit for purpose.\" He added: \"West coast passengers can rest assured that while we seek urgently to resolve the future arrangements the trains that run now will continue to run, with the same drivers, the same staff and timetables as planned.

They show a lack of good process and a lack of proper quality assurance. \"I am determined to identify exactly what went wrong and why, and to put these things right so that we never find ourselves in this position again.\" The first independent review will be overseen by Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, and the former PricewaterhouseCoopers strategy chairman Ed Smith to work out what went wrong with the award of the franchise. It is expected to report by the end of October. The second review, to be undertaken by the Eurostar chairman, Richard Brown, will examine the wider rail franchising programme and look in detail at whether changes are needed to the way risk is assessed and to the bidding and evaluation processes, and at how to get the other franchise competitions back on track. The DfT said it found evidence of significant flaws as its officials were gathering evidence in preparation for legal proceedings. These flaws stem from the way the level of risk in the bids was evaluated. Mistakes were made in the way in which inflation and passenger numbers were taken into account, and how much money bidders were then asked to guarantee as a result. The department said it could not be confident that these flaws would not have changed the outcome of the competition or that any of the four bidders would not have chosen to submit different offers. The four bidding companies \u2013 First, Virgin, Keolis-SNCF and Abellio \u2013 will all be compensated, and have been assured a fresh competition will be started. The costs will be around \u00a340m \u2013 \u00a314m to Virgin alone. McLoughlin said he did not anticipate having to reimburse transport groups bidding in the other, currently frozen, franchise processes. Meanwhile, the political fallout will see not just the franchise but the government and the privatised rail system under scrutiny. 'Fiasco' The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, said it was a \"fiasco\" that had \"again exposed the shambolic incompetence of this Tory-led government\". She said: \"Only last week the transport secretary repeated his claim that the process was conducted properly and he would hand over the franchise to First on time, despite all the concerns that had been raised. The government's belated admission that it ran a flawed tendering process will come as a surprise to no one. \"The transport secretary must now reveal the full details of what went wrong and come clean on the full cost to taxpayers of this shambles.\" She added that Labour would support the transfer of the west coast service to DOR, the DfT's rail company, and called for the government to abandon the planned privatisation of the east coast line. Louise Ellman, the chair of the transport select committee, said it would be recalling the secretary of state to answer more questions after he assured MPs at a hearing last month of the fairness of the process. The leader of the RMT union, Bob Crow, said: \"The whole sorry and expensive shambles of rail privatisation has been dragged into the spotlight this morning and instead of re-running this expensive circus, the west coast route should be renationalised on a permanent basis.\" \u2022 This article was corrected on 3 October 2012 because the original said shares in FirstGroup were at \u00a319.07 in early trading on Wednesday, when it should have said 197p.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco profits fall for first time in almost 20 years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco has reported its first fall in profits in 20 years after it was forced to invest heavily to revive its struggling UK chain and cracks emerged in its sprawling international empire. Its chief executive, Philip Clarke, said it was \"far too early\" to say whether the \u00a31bn facelift announced for its UK supermarkets back in April was winning back shoppers: \"The signs are encouraging but the plan is a long course of treatment, not a single dose.\" The UK chain managed flat like-for-likes in the second quarter, ending an 18-month losing streak. The performance of the domestic chain is crucial to the group's success as it generates two-thirds of group profits, but on Wednesday alarm bells sounded after Tesco warned that its profits were also being squeezed in South Korea, its second biggest market, and that US chain Fresh &amp; Easy had failed to make any inroads into its losses. Overall group trading profit dropped 10.5% to \u00a31.6bn in the six months to 25 August; within Britain, profits were down more than 12.4% at \u00a31.1bn. \"The market was prepared for a decline in profits but this is a disappointing statement even in that context,\" said Seymour Pierce analyst Kate Calvert. She said the performance of Tesco Bank, which will launch current accounts next year, \"was the only positive\". New laws in Korea mean Tesco can no longer trade its Homeplus stores round the clock and must close two Sundays a month \u2013 a restriction that is expected to shave \u00a3100m off group profits this year. Problems also emerged in its previously reliable Central European division, where profits slumped by a fifth as the \"chill winds\" of the crisis in the eurozone reached consumers in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, who are cutting back spending on non-essential goods such as electricals and homewares. Speculation over the future of Fresh &amp; Easy also intensified after it announced a worse than expected loss of \u00a374m and slowed the rate of new store openings for a second time. Clarke insisted shareholders were more interested in the fate of the domestic operation: \"The real question from investors when I speak to them is about the UK. So many retailers who have gone global have given up their home market \u2026 I will not allow that to happen and I could feel that it was in danger.\" After a poor Christmas, Tesco stunned investors in January when the company issued its first profit warning in more than 20 years, with Clarke citing the need to invest heavily in the UK chain where it had taken \"a little bit too much away from the shopper\" during years of penny-pinching to boost profits. At the retailer's annual results in April, Clarke fleshed out plans for a \u00a31bn programme to refurbish 430 stores and hire the equivalent of 8,000 new store workers to improve customer service. More than half the stores have now been revamped and Clarke said he was \"encouraged\" by customers' initial responses to the changes being made. But he added: \"Our first target is to be performing in line with the [UK] industry in like-for-like terms.\" Clarke maintains that the UK grocery industry is at a crossroads, as the worlds of physical and online shopping collide. With that in mind he has cut the rate of new store space being opened this year by 40% and is trying to reinvent its largest \"Extra\" hypermarkets, which, with rows of flat-screen TVs and home furnishings, are increasingly obsolete as consumers either cut back spending or browse online. In some of the new-look stores it had added bigger food and clothing ranges, but Clarke said it would consider \"downsizing\" some of the Extras, a push that could see space sublet to other retailers. It has already opened a branch of fast food chain Nandos in its Extra store in Wembley, north London, although Clarke was quick to add: \"I'm not saying that was the answer.\" With the major grocers fighting for market share, Tesco had been accused by some analysts of buying customers with a campaign of money-off coupons. Clarke insisted the level of discounting was the same as a year ago, but they had used customer information gleaned from the Clubcard loyalty scheme to tailor offers to individual shoppers' buying habits. On Wednesday Sainsbury's reported like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, of 1.9% for its second quarter, though that figure was flattered by extensions to its supermarkets that have generated more selling space. Not so easy in the US Tesco's US start-up Fresh &amp; Easy should be given a \"deadline\" of another six months to prove itself after racking up a bigger than expected loss in the first six months of the year. The grocer has ploughed more than \u00a31bn into the five-year-old chain which is yet to turn a profit and on Wednesday dramatically scaled back expansion plans for this year to concentrate on making the 199 stores it already has profitable. At present less than 30% of Fresh &amp; Easy stores make a positive contribution and Tesco boss Philip Clarke indicated his dissatisfaction: \"We need more from Fresh &amp; Easy.\" But added that \"if we can find a way through\" the business potentially offered \"decades of value for shareholders\". Ahead of the first store openings in 2007 Tesco claimed to have spent thousands of hours researching US shopping habits, including hiring researchers to probe the fridge contents and lifestyles of 60 American families, checking the time they got up, what they ate for breakfast and when they shopped. However, the original store interiors and product ranges have since been completely rejigged and more changes are in prospect including the introduction of staffed checkouts after some customers were put off by self-service tills. Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan said that if the US chain was closed or sold Tesco's share price \"would rocket. \"This may not be the best long-term outcome, but if it is to remain part of the group, then we would expect to see very compelling evidence that this makes sense. We think that the deadline is the prelims in April.\"",

    "webTitle": "4G will arrive in UK by summer 2013 after mobile networks deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK will have nationwide 4G services running on multiple networks by the end of next summer \u2013 six months earlier than originally proposed \u2013 under a deal sealed in a meeting between the networks and culture secretary Maria Miller on Tuesday night. The agreement will shorten the headstart won by EE, the largest network company and parent of Orange and T-Mobile, which intends to launch the country's first 4G service later this month. So-called \"fourth generation\" mobile technology allows much faster internet connections for phones than today's 3G networks. With the iPhone 5 and high-end smartphones from Nokia and Samsung designed for some British 4G spectrum bands, operators are now racing to build the networks capable of running them at full speed \u2013 which will allow users to download movies in seconds and make high quality video calls. EE already owns enough spare spectrum to be able to launch this year, while its rivals O2, Vodafone and Three must wait for a government airwaves auction to acquire enough bandwidth for 4G. In an 11-page letter sent to Miller on Monday night, telecoms regulator Ofcom offered to bring forward both the auction date and the deadline for clearing the spectrum being sold from digital TV signals so they are free to carry mobile phone traffic. The heads of the UK networks agreed a peace treaty on Tuesday night after months of legal wrangling. \"Delivering 4G quickly is a key part of our economic growth strategy,\" said Miller. \" I am grateful to the mobile operators for their co-operation in bringing forward vital 4G services. The open and collaborative approach taken between the government and the mobile companies will have hugely beneficial results for UK business and investment. We anticipate that 4G services will boost the UK's economy by around \u00a32-3bn.\" O2's UK chief executive, Ronan Dunne, said that after intensive lobbyingthe auction would begin in January instead of February or March. It is expected to bring in up to \u00a34bn for the government's coffers. Dunne added that masts company Arqiva would be able to clear away digital TV signals in England, Wales and most areas of Scotland by May, with networks able to launch services by the end of the summer after around two months of testing. However, the harder to reach Highlands and Islands will have to wait longer for 4G, with services not expected until later in 2013. The UK's 4G auction has suffered from repeated delays after a combination of legal threats from phone companies and a mix-up over digital TV signals. UK digital channels launched on a different band to the rest of Europe and Arqiva is now rushing to harmonise them in line with the continent. Dozens of other nations including Germany, the US and even smaller economies like Estonia already have 4G, putting the UK in danger of losing its reputation as a pioneer in mobile technology. In a presentation which laid part of the blame for the slow progress at Ofcom's door, Dunne said: \"Everyone is pleased that we've made this progress, it's just a little bit frustrating that it's taken so long. Before our various interventions we didn't have a genuine level playing field and we risked a 4G digital divide.\" But the regulator denied that it was to blame. Ofcom's chief executive, Ed Richards, said: \"The actions we have taken with industry and government avoids the risk of significant delay and is tremendous news for consumers who might otherwise have waited a considerable period for the next generation of mobile broadband services. Ofcom's objective has always been to release the spectrum as early as possible and we remain focused on starting the auction by the end of the year.\" All operators have now agreed not to litigate either EE or the 4G auction. It is understood that the EE chief executive, Olaf Swantee, has promised not to hold up the work of Mitco, a jointly owned company charged with clearing the spectrum for mobile use over the coming months. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said he will spend the proceeds on building affordable homes and a stamp duty holiday if Labour is elected. Responding to Balls's plans, announced at his keynote Labour party conference speech on Monday, Dunne said: \"It would have been nice to have had an auction before somebody actually went and spent the proceeds.\"",

      "body": "<p>The UK will have nationwide 4G services running on multiple networks by the end of next summer \u2013 six months earlier than originally proposed \u2013 under a deal sealed in a meeting between the networks and culture secretary Maria Miller on Tuesday night.</p> <p>The agreement will shorten the headstart won by EE, the largest network company and parent of Orange and T-Mobile, which intends to launch the country's first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/22/4g-dream-investment-mobile-internet\" title=\"\">4G service</a> later this month.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/22/4g-mobile-internet-everything-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">So-called \"fourth generation\" mobile technology</a> allows much faster internet connections for phones than today's 3G networks. With the iPhone 5 and high-end smartphones from Nokia and Samsung designed for some British 4G spectrum bands, operators are now racing to build the networks capable of running them at full speed \u2013 which will allow users to download movies in seconds and make high quality video calls.</p> <p>EE already owns enough spare spectrum to be able to launch this year, while its rivals O2, Vodafone and Three must wait for a government airwaves auction to acquire enough bandwidth for 4G.</p> <p>In an 11-page letter sent to Miller on Monday night, telecoms regulator Ofcom offered to bring forward both the auction date and the deadline for clearing the spectrum being sold from digital TV signals so they are free to carry mobile phone traffic.</p> <p>The heads of the UK networks agreed a peace treaty on Tuesday night after months of legal wrangling.</p> <p>\"Delivering 4G quickly is a key part of our economic growth strategy,\" said Miller. \" I am grateful to the mobile operators for their co-operation in bringing forward vital 4G services. The open and collaborative approach taken between the government and the mobile companies will have hugely beneficial results for UK business and investment. We anticipate that 4G services will boost the UK's economy by around \u00a32-3bn.\"</p> <p>O2's UK chief executive, Ronan Dunne, said that after intensive lobbyingthe auction would begin in January instead of February or March. It is expected to bring in up to \u00a34bn for the government's coffers.</p> <p>Dunne added that masts company Arqiva would be able to clear away digital TV signals in England, Wales and most areas of Scotland by May, with networks able to launch services by the end of the summer after around two months of testing. However, the harder to reach Highlands and Islands will have to wait longer for 4G, with services not expected until later in 2013.</p> <p>The UK's 4G auction has suffered from repeated delays after a combination of legal threats from phone companies and a mix-up over digital TV signals. UK digital channels launched on a different band to the rest of Europe and Arqiva is now rushing to harmonise them in line with the continent.</p> <p>Dozens of other nations including Germany, the US and even smaller economies like Estonia already have 4G, putting the UK in danger of losing its reputation as a pioneer in mobile technology.</p> <p>In a presentation which laid part of the blame for the slow progress at Ofcom's door, Dunne said: \"Everyone is pleased that we've made this progress, it's just a little bit frustrating that it's taken so long. Before our various interventions we didn't have a genuine level playing field and we risked a 4G digital divide.\"</p> <p>But the regulator denied that it was to blame.</p> <p>Ofcom's chief executive, Ed Richards, said: \"The actions we have taken with industry and government avoids the risk of significant delay and is tremendous news for consumers who might otherwise have waited a considerable period for the next generation of mobile broadband services.
