      "bodyText": "The euro sank to a nine-year low against the dollar on Monday as the beleagured eurozone, dogged by fears of deflation and a Greek exit from the currency bloc, was throw into sharp contrast with a soaring US economy. In a busy day of trading the single currency dipped below $1.19 to a level not seen since December 2005, before recovering slightly. The fall followed reports in Germany that the conservative-led coalition in Berlin would take a hard line if a new Greek government demanded a cut in its debt mountain and sought relief from years of austerity. German ministers were reported as saying they were sanguine about a possible vote in Athens to leave the eurozone once these \u201cimpossible\u201d demands were rebuffed. Though the comments were later denied by a spokesman for Angela Merkel, they triggered a response from Brussels, which took a softer line on possible concessions to Greece while stating membership of the eurozone was \u201cirrevocable\u201d. Traders are weighing up the prospect that the anti-austerity Syriza party could win this month\u2019s Greek election, raising doubts about the country\u2019s commitment to the terms of its international bailout and its position within the euro bloc. Syriza\u2019s leader, Alexis Tsipras, has made a number of campaign promises in recent months, costing around \u00a39bn more than is allowed under a deal with Brussels and Greece\u2019s other main lender, the International Monetary Fund. The 19-member currency zone has also come under pressure following predictions that the European Central Bank is poised to print billions of euros as part of a full-blown quantitative easing programme. Designed to stimulate the region\u2019s moribund economy, QE is expected to make long-term interest rates lower, driving down the value of the euro. The ECB president, Mario Draghi, will come under pressure to begin QE within the next couple of months following data from Germany showing inflation fell in five of its largest regions last month. Analysts said the eurozone\u2019s largest economy could suffer a prolonged period of deflation, discouraging consumer spending and depressing wage rises. Funds have flowed out of the eurozone to the US to avoid the prospect of worsening instability and also to benefit from the booming US economy. Currency dealers have poured money into US assets, driving the dollar to a near decade-high against the euro. A statement by the US central bank overnight was expected to hint strongly that the economy\u2019s robust growth rate over recent quarters of 4% or more will bring forward the first interest rate rise since the 2008 crash. Sterling also benefited from the flight of eurozone funds to trade near to six-year highs against the euro reached last week. The pound climbed to more than \u20ac1.28. It had passed \u20ac1.29 on Friday to reach its highest level since October 2008 before being weighed down by disappointing UK manufacturing and mortgage approval data. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, joined the European Commission in taking a softer line with Athens, saying the Greeks were \u201cfree to decide their government\u201d in the election, and that \u201cas for Greece remaining in the eurozone it\u2019s up to Greece alone to decide\u201d. He said Greece and Spain had \u201cpaid a heavy price\u201d to keep the European currency, and that there had been a \u201cradical\u201d reaction from fringe parties. But he played down the danger of electing Syriza and the radical Podemos party in Spain, saying that they could not be compared to the risks from the extreme right. If the radicals were elected in either country, he added, they would have to stick to the commitments of previous governments, in particular regarding the management of debt. EU spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt said that if the Greek elections call for a need to reconsider the conditions of Athens\u2019 membership within the eurozone, \u201cwe will deal with that once the Greek voters have cast their verdict\u201d. At the same time, she insisted that a full exit by Greece was not on the cards as the euro rules say \u201cmembership is irrevocable\u201d. In Berlin government spokesman Steffen Seibert said: \u201cSince the beginning it has been the policy of the government to strengthen the eurozone including Greece. This has not changed.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Oil price dips below $53 as fears of global economic slowdown intensify", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares fell heavily on stock markets on Monday as a fresh plunge in the cost of crude to $53 a barrel intensified fears of a slowdown in the global economy. The price of a barrel of Brent North Sea oil fell by about 6% to its lowest level in five and a half years amid evidence that Russia and Iraq are continuing to increase production despite signs that demand for energy has softened in recent months. Economists believe cheaper crude will lead to stronger global growth, and there was an immediate boost to consumer spending in the UK when the supermarkets intensified their fuel price war. But there was a negative reaction on stock markets, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 index, which contains a number of big energy companies such as Shell and BP, closing down 130.64 points at 6417.16. Wall Street\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average fell 331 points to close at 17,501. Lower oil prices will lead to higher disposable incomes and cut business costs, but stock markets believe the slide in oil prices from a peak of $115 a barrel last summer reflects the slowdown in China, recession in Japan and looming deflation in the eurozone. As Brent crude lost more than $3 a barrel in London, falling through $53 before recovering to $53.24, New York light crude briefly dipped below $50 a barrel. Oil analysts blamed soft global demand and increased production from countries such as Russia and Iraq. \u201cThe easiest path for oil is down,\u201d said Carsten Fritsch, senior oil and commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. \u201cAlmost all market news and the fundamental backdrop are negative and it is difficult to see much upside at the moment.\u201c Lacklustre economic data from the United States on Friday increased concerns about the state of the global economy and the strength of oil demand. \u201cOil demand is unlikely to be robust this year when we look at the state of economies in China, Japan and Europe,\u201d said Yusuke Seta, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan. Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial, said: \u201cThe lower that oil prices go, the more it reinforces into the market\u2019s mind that perhaps this is more of a demand issue than a supply issue.\u201d He said that raised questions \u201cabout the robustness of this recovery\u201d. In the UK the prospect of motorists paying less than a pound a litre for petrol came closer on Tuesday when falling oil prices led to four supermarket chains announcing a 2p a litre cut in petrol and diesel. Asda said it would cut petrol and diesel by 2p and Tesco responded with immediate price reductions. Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s have also made 2p cuts, bringing prices at the pumps to a five-year low. The latest reductions mean Asda customers will pay no more than 105.7p a litre for petrol and 112.7p for diesel. It was Asda\u2019s 14th fuel cut since the end of September, with 21p a litre off petrol and 17p off diesel. For Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s, it was the seventh cut since the beginning of December. Andy Peake, Asda\u2019s director of petrol trading, said: \u201cAs fuel prices continue to drop, Asda is leading the way with our fourteenth price cut on fuel since September. No matter where customers live, they will benefit from the same fuel price with our national price cap of 105.7p a litre for unleaded and 112.7p for diesel.\u201d Motoring organisations welcomed the cuts. The RAC\u2019s fuel spokesman, Simon Williams, said: \u201cWith the average price of petrol already at levels not seen since January 2010 this latest cut will send the average price (112p) even lower, which is more great news for the motorist as millions head back to work following the festive holiday. \u201cWe think there is still more room to cut further, perhaps by as much as 5p to 6p by the end of January. \u201cThe cuts are bringing us ever closer to the \u00a31 per litre average for petrol which the RAC said last month could be a possibility for the start of the new year. Of course it would also be an extremely welcome move for motorists and businesses alike.\u201d The AA president, Edmund King, said: \u201cFurther drops in the pump price are extremely welcome. However, small rural towns are again being left behind by the price falls in the more competitive areas. This continues to feather the fall in the national average. \u201cWe would love to see \u00a31 per litre and we may possibly see it in many parts of the UK but it is unlikely that the average price will drop as quickly to the \u00a31 level, partly because 70% of the price is tax. There is still a price lottery out there so we advise drivers to shop around.\u201d",

Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s have also made 2p cuts, bringing prices at the pumps to a five-year low.</p> <p>The latest reductions mean Asda customers will pay no more than 105.7p a litre for petrol and 112.7p for diesel. It was Asda\u2019s 14th fuel cut since the end of September, with 21p a litre off petrol and 17p off diesel. For Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s, it was the seventh cut since the beginning of December.</p> <p>Andy Peake, Asda\u2019s director of petrol trading, said: \u201cAs fuel prices continue to drop, Asda is leading the way with our fourteenth price cut on fuel since September. No matter where customers live, they will benefit from the same fuel price with our national price cap of 105.7p a litre for unleaded and 112.7p for diesel.\u201d</p> <p>Motoring organisations welcomed the cuts. The RAC\u2019s fuel spokesman, Simon Williams, said: \u201cWith the average price of petrol already at levels not seen since January 2010 this latest cut will send the average price (112p) even lower, which is more great news for the motorist as millions head back to work following the festive holiday.</p> <p>\u201cWe think there is still more room to cut further, perhaps by as much as 5p to 6p by the end of January.</p> <p>\u201cThe cuts are bringing us ever closer to the \u00a31 per litre average for petrol which the RAC said last month could be a possibility for the start of the new year. Of course it would also be an extremely welcome move for motorists and businesses alike.\u201d</p> <p>The AA president, Edmund King, said: \u201cFurther drops in the pump price are extremely welcome. However, small rural towns are again being left behind by the price falls in the more competitive areas. This continues to feather the fall in the national average.</p> <p>\u201cWe would love to see \u00a31 per litre and we may possibly see it in many parts of the UK but it is unlikely that the average price will drop as quickly to the \u00a31 level, partly because 70% of the price is tax. There is still a price lottery out there so we advise drivers to shop around.\u201d</p>",

Some of the spending pledges Osborne identified are not actually official opposition policy. In other cases it is assumed that criticising what the government is doing automatically involves a spending commitment. Labour has, for example, attacked plans for cuts in local government spending in 2015-16, but it has not pledged to reverse them. Problem number two is that the Conservatives assume that all Labour\u2019s spending plans would be implemented from day one of a Miliband government. Ed Balls, however, has made it clear that he would stick to Osborne\u2019s spending totals for 2015-16. Labour frontbenchers will only have more money to spend if the economy performs better than expected, if there are tax increases or if savings can be found elsewhere. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies has pointed out, Labour has been the most cautious of the main parties when it comes to pre-election giveaways, and the shadow chancellor is unpopular with some in his party for this very reason. The fact that the IFS - the accepted arbiter of tax, spending and borrowing matters in the UK - has taken this line is the third reason not to take the Osborne dossier at face value. In the end, though, politics is as much about perception as it is about fact. Opinion polls suggest that voters are receptive to the argument that Labour left the economy and public finances in an awful mess in 2010.

      "bodyText": "Time for a mid-afternoon summary: Oil prices have continued to slide on Monday. Benchmark Brent crude is hovering above $54 a barrel and expected to fall further. The FTSE100 has extended its losses, down 1.35% to 6,457 points. Germany\u2019s DAX is down 1.43%, after data showed weaker-than-expected inflation in December, raising expectations that the European Central Bank will be forced to act to curb deflationary pressures in the eurozone. A spokesman for Angela Merkel has rebutted reports that Germany expects Greece to leave the eurozone. But a report that German officials are relaxed about a Grexit has opened up new rifts in Germany\u2019s political class. That\u2019s all from today\u2019s business blog. Thank you for following and commenting. Around 400,000 jobs will be created in 2015, pushing the unemployment rate down to its pre-recessionary levels, according to the labour market economist John Philpott. The economist has forecast that unemployment will fall to 1.7m, dropping back to the rate of 5.2%, not seen since before the recession. Average weekly earnings will grow by 2.5%, outstripping inflation for the whole of 2015. While this will be \u201cthe best [year] overall for the UK labour market since 2007\u201d, not all workers will notice a marked improvement in their lot. Philpott writes that the labour market divide will widen in 2015. Workers with particular technical skills or personal talents in high demand will begin to fare noticeably better in relative terms as will those working for organisations voluntarily prepared and able to offer low skilled workers the Living Wage. But in a labour market still oversupplied with people desperate for whatever work is on offer, employers unable or unwilling to improve working conditions will continue to have no difficulty in hiring staff into minimum wage jobs or on zero-hours contracts without any fringe benefits. This will serve to further widen what has become a clear structural \u2018workforce divide\u2019 within the UK\u2019s ultra-flexible and lightly regulated labour market. A Greek exit from the eurozone poses dangers to the rest of the currency union, writes Capital Economics. The economics consultancy, which won a \u00a3250,000 prize on the least disruptive way to break up the euro, chides investors for their sanguine view on recent developments in Greece. It would be complacent to conclude that Greece\u2019s travails present no dangers to the currency union. For a start, the last eurozone crisis also began as an isolated development in Greece, before spreading to other countries. In that sense, the lack of contagion so far provides limited comfort. Secondly, the fact that the latest Greek crisis has occurred despite a significant improvement in the country\u2019s economic performance and sharp drop in its budget deficit is arguably a warning to other supposedly healthier countries that they are not immune from renewed market fears. Other countries with very high debt ratios, such as Italy and Portugal, appear most vulnerable. And finally, it is far from clear that the policy advances made in recent years are adequate either to ensure a smooth Grexit or to deal with renewed difficulties in other countries. Not only is the ECB\u2019s bond-buying power unproven, but it is unlikely that the bailout funds are big enough to resolve serious problems in a country like Italy. In short, while much hangs on the January 25th election, there is a clear risk that growing uncertainty over Greece\u2019s future in the euro-zone will come to have broader negative economic and market effects in 2015. The latest Grexit rumours have created division within the Social Democratic party, the junior partner in Germany\u2019s grand coalition. Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent, reports: A heated row has broken out within the German government over how to deal with Greece in the event it votes a left-wing party into power.Following an election pledge by Alexis Tsipras, the head of the Syriza party, to cancel austerity measures and write off much of Greek debt in the event he wins, Germany\u2019s economics minister Sigmar Gabriel has warned Athens that Berlin can \u201cno longer be blackmailed\u201d.His admonition came after it was reported that Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble believe the Eurozone could weather a Greek exit and that such a scenario would be almost unavoidable were Syriza to win. But Gabriel\u2019s message to the Greek electorate has sparked misgivings within his Social Democratic Party (SPD), some of whose members have accused him and Merkel of adopting a highly risky approach. The German government has been accused of trying to influence the outcome of the Greek election with its warnings. But some experts have advised that the tactic could backfire if Greek voters decided to call the German government\u2019s bluff. A Grexit, experts warn, would be hugely expensive to Germany in particular, and could further destabilise an already shaky Euro. Gabriel told the Hannoverschen Allgemeinen Zeitung that the German government\u2019s goal was to see Greece stay in the Eurozone, but that it also expected Athens to fulfill its promises to the EU. Regardless of who forms the next government, we expect that they stick by the agreements made with the EU. The Eurozone is considerably more stable and robust than it was several years ago, which is why we can no longer be blackmailed. But the vice chair of the SPD\u2019s parliamentary group, Carsten Schneider, said Gabriel\u2019s position was \u201cunsupportable\u201d. Johannes Kahrs of the conservative wing of the SPD, tweeted: Merkel and Schauble are on their own regarding their U-Turn over Greece and Europe. That way will only be even more expensive for the tax payer. Simone Peter of the opposition Greens called the debate over a Grexit \u201chighly irresponsible\u201d. The fall in German inflation has raised expectations that the European Central Bank will start buying government bonds to support prices in the eurozone. Jennifer McKeown, senior economist at Capital Economics, said there is a good chance of further falls in inflation in the coming months. With weaker economies elsewhere in the euro-zone set to register even lower outturns, the euro-zone figure released this Wednesday is set to be negative for the first time since October 2009. Such a development would surely make the pressure for the ECB to implement quantitative easing at its January meeting irresistible. On Wednesday, we will get EU-wide data on prices. German inflation in a chart Energy and food have dragged down prices in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Consumer prices rose 0.1% in Germany in December, compared to the previous year. Prices for goods fell by 1.2%, including: Energy -6.6% Food -1.2% Prices for services rose 1.4% Source: Reuters German inflation fell to 0.1% in December, its lowest level in five years, according to figures just released by the Federal Statistics Office. The figure was below economists expectations of a 0.2% increase in prices. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said on Monday that \u201cGreece alone\u201d can decide on whether to stay in the euro, writes Anne Penketh, a Guardian correspondent in Paris. Hollande was asked about a German report over the weekend that Chancellor Angela Merkel would let Greece leave the single currency, during an interview on France-Inter radio. But he said that the Greeks were \u201cfree to decide their government\u201d in the forthcoming elections, and that \u201cas for Greece remaining in the eurozone it\u2019s up to Greece alone to decide.\u201d He noted that both Greece and Spain had \u201cpaid a heavy price\u201d to keep the European currency, and that there had been a \u201cradical\u201d reaction from fringe parties. But he played down the danger of electing the radical Syriza party in Greece and Podemos in Spain, saying that they could not be compared to the risks from the extreme-right. And if the radicals were elected in either country, he added, they would have to stick to the commitments of previous governments, in particular regarding the management of debt. He added that \u201cthe rules governing the euro,\u201d should be respected. Hollande used the turmoil in Greece to reaffirm that the EU now needed to ditch its unpopular German-led austerity policies. \u201cEurope can\u2019t be identified with austerity, now that the euro has been stabilised,\u201d he said. Asked about the divergence between Germany and France on austerity measures, he announced that he would meet Merkel and the President of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, next Sunday to discuss \u201cthe future of Europe and Franco-German relations\u201d. The eurozone is unlikely to stage a full recovery until the Greek problem is solved, according to a former senior policymaker at the European Central Bank. Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, an ex-member of the executive board of the ECB, warns that solving the Greek debt problem will be exceptionally difficult. In an article on the FT\u2019s exchange blog, he writes that Greece\u2019s creditors will be reluctant to reduce its debt burden. But politics also pose irreconcilable problems. The problem is that the Greek people have made it clear that they do not want to exit the euro, as they consider it their only anchor against domestic political inefficiency and instability. The populist parties have understood this, and now claim they will be able to circle the square while staying in the monetary union. The claim is unrealistic, but the people of Greece might be too exasperated to grasp that. It is generally too late when people realise that they cannot have back the cake they just ate. More here (metred paywall) A European Commission spokesperson in Brussels has said \u201cthe euro has proved its resilience\u201d. Twitter is a bit sceptical. The Grexit index is on the rise again. Joseph Weisenthal of Bloomberg has put together this nifty chart. Warnings of an apocalyptic future and a row over government debt. It can only mean one thing: an election campaign has started. Not that one. The Greek election on 25 January. Greece\u2019s two largest parties have been trading accusations, as campaigning got underway at the weekend. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said Greece would be forced out of the eurozone if left-wing anti-austerity party Syriza won the election. Speaking at his party congress on Saturday, Alexis Tsipras, leader of Syriza, vowed to end \u201cunreasonable and catastrophic\u201dausterity. He said a Syriza-led government would write down most of the nominal value of Greece\u2019s debt. That\u2019s what was done for Germany in 1953, it should be done for Greece in 2015. As Bloomberg reports, a wild card in the election is former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou who on 3 January announced the formation of a political party called the Democratic Socialists. Papandreou, a former leader of the Socialists (Pasok), was prime minister from October 2009 to November 2011.

Via the wires: German govt spokesman says there is no change in stance of the German govt towards Greece. German finance ministry spokesman, we expect Greece to stick to its commitments. German govt spokesman says Greece has long-term commitments, a new govt will not change that. The European Central Bank is coming under growing pressure to inject a dose of stimulus in the eurozone, amid mounting evidence of falling prices. German inflation is expected to have fallen in December, when data is published later today. Figures from five German states released this morning showed across-the-board declines in the annual inflation rate, largely because of falling energy prices. Reuters reports from Berlin: Prices in the big state of North Rhine-Westphalia inched up just 0.1% down sharply from a 0.7% rise in November. In Bavaria, prices rose 0.3% year-on-year, down from 0.8 %. In Hesse, annual inflation fell to zero from 0.5 % in the prior month, while in Baden-Wuerttemberg inflation slowed to 0.1 % from 0.5 % previously. A preliminary pan-German inflation figure for December is due to be released on Monday at 1300 GMT. Broader inflation data for the entire 19-nation euro zone is due on Wednesday. Last week ECB President Mario Draghi said the risks to price stability had increased and the bank had to be ready to act. European Central Bank boss hints at stimulus to fight deflation Slowing growth in the UK construction industry has heightened expectations that interest rates will remain unchanged for most of 2015. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS, says the prospects for construction look decent, although it is likely to expand at a slower rate in 2015 than the previous year. Following on from a weaker manufacturing survey, the softer December construction purchasing managers\u2019 survey will likely sustain strong belief that the Bank of England will not be raising interest rates before the latter months of 2015. There can be no doubt that the Bank of England will kick off 2015 by keeping interest rates unchanged at 0.50% at the conclusion of the January MPC meeting on Thursday This graph tells the 10-year story of the UK construction industry: a massive fall in 2009 and faltering return to growth. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, the co-organiser of the survey, said construction was on a weaker trajectory than that seen in recent months. The sector is still expanding with the index posting at a higher level than the longer-term average, and led primarily by residential development - but it has become a victim of its own success as it struggles to keep up with its own speed of recovery. With increases in new business, comes pressures on the availability of talented staff and a squeeze on the performance of supply chains. He said the election was making construction managers more cautious. Levels of positive outlook remain high with 52% of respondents expecting a rise in business activity in 2015, though this month\u2019s sudden drop in the strength of the civil engineering sub-sector and this year\u2019s General Election is adding a note of caution. I expect we will hear a lot more of this argument in the next four months... Growth in the UK construction industry slowed in December to a 17-month low, despite a sharp increase in home building, according to the latest monthly Markit/CIPS survey. According to Markit, 2014 was the best year for British house building since records began in 1997. But a decline in civil engineering projects meant that overall construction saw slowing growth. The headline figure was 57.6 in December, down from 59.4 in November on an index when anything over 50 counts as expansion. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit and author of the Markit/CIPS Construction PMI, said: UK construction output growth retreated further in December, but another strong expansion of house building activity ensured that the sector continued to perform impressively overall. Indeed, over the course of 2014, UK construction firms recorded the strongest calendar year of residential building since the survey began in 1997. A sharp recovery in house building, as well as resurgent demand for commercial development projects, continued to boost staff recruitment and sub-contractor pay rates across the construction sector in December. Breaking news: the British construction industry grew at its slowest rate since July 2013, although residential building remained robust. Around 1 million extra passengers flew Ryanair in December as the budget airline\u2019s attempts to be nicer to customers seems to be paying off. My colleague Sean Farrell reports: The number of customers flying with the Irish carrier jumped 20% to 6.02 million as seat occupancy rose to 88% from 81% a year earlier. Ryanair used to ground many of its aircraft during winter, but this year it has filled more seats while flying more planes. In the year to December, Ryanair\u2019s customer numbers rose 6% to 86.4 million customers. Ryanair\u2019s shares are up 0.3%, bucking the downward trend on the FTSE.

Most of the main bourses opened down on reports of a Greek exit from the eurozone, but have since recovered. France and Germany\u2019s main exchanges have edged into positive territory, after falling in early trading. FTSE100 -0.2% at 6,531 points Germany\u2019s DAX +0.2% at 9,785 points France\u2019s CAC +0.44% at 4,271 points Was down 0.7% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB -0.26% at 19,067 points Athens ATG index -0.9% at 826 points Was down 1.9% Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has said it is up to Greece to decide whether they wish to remain in the single currency. Speaking on French radio this morning he said: When it comes to Greece\u2019s membership of the eurozone, it is for Greece alone to decide. Arguably, the weakness of the French economy could be more decisive for the eurozone. Hollande said he hoped economic growth would be above 1% in 2015 and 2015 - higher than official forecasts. Adopting the masochism strategy, he also took responsibility for high unemployment and the weak state of the French economy. I am president of the Republic. I am not going to say [France\u2019s low growth] is the fault of the foreigner... the fault of the crisis. Source: RFI It is an unhappy start to the new year for the Russian currency. The Russian rouble has fallen by almost 5% against the dollar to 58.51 roubles in early trading after oil prices hit a five-year low. A barrel of Brent crude fell to $51.40 on Monday, its lowest since May 2009. Russia depends on oil revenues for more than half its state budget. An interesting business story on the Guardian\u2019s front page today: The entrepreneur and inventor Sir James Dyson has hit out at Teresa May\u2019s plans to expel international students once they have graduated. The home secretary wants the Conservatives to make a manifesto commitment to force students from outside the EU to leave the UK on completing their degrees. Sir James Dyson, best-known for his bagless vacuum cleaners, described the plan as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d. In an article in the Guardian he writes: Theresa May\u2019s latest ploy to swing voters concerned about immigration magnifies my worry: she wants to exile foreign students upon qualification from British universities. Train \u2019em up. Kick \u2019em out. It\u2019s a bit shortsighted, isn\u2019t it? A short-term vote winner that leads to long-term economic decline. Of course the government needs to be seen to be \u201cdoing something\u201d. But postgraduate research in particular leads to exportable, patentable technology. Binning foreign postgraduates is, I suppose, a quick fix. But quick fixes don\u2019t build long-term futures. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The euro has fallen to a nine-year low against the dollar this morning, following a report that German chancellor Angela Merkel is ready to see Greece leave the currency union. According to the report in the weekly magazine Der Spiegel, German officials believe a Greek exit is almost inevitable in the event that left-wing opposition party Syriza wins the Greek election on 25 January. The magazine quotes German government officials, who sound pretty relaxed about a Grexit. One source said: The danger of contagion is limited because Portugal and Ireland are considered rehabilitated. This line was echoed by Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy in Brussels. He told Bloomberg Many European officials believe a Greek exit would be manageable, and in contrast to 2010-2011, we wouldn\u2019t see the same cascading effect on countries like Spain or Ireland. But the German government has insisted it wants Greece to stay in the eurozone. Sigmar Gabriel, the German economy minister and leader of the Social Democrats, said there were no plans for Greece to leave the currency union. That is why we can\u2019t be blackmailed and why we expect the Greece government no matter who leads it, to abide by the agreements made with the EU. The euro fell to 1.18605 against the dollar on Monday, its lowest since March 2006, but later edged up to 1.1948 The expectation of monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank is also driving sentiment on currency markets, after ECB chief Mario Draghi dropped a heavy hint of more action in an interview last week. We are also expecting data on German inflation and UK construction PMI figures. All that and more to follow...",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair\u2019s shares hit a record high after the budget airline\u2019s customer charm offensive attracted 1 million extra passengers in December. The number of people flying with the Irish carrier jumped 20% to 6.02 million last month as seat occupancy rose to 88% from 81% a year earlier. Ryanair used to ground many of its aircraft during winter, but this year it has filled more seats while flying more planes. The strong trading figures sent Ryanair\u2019s shares up more than 3% to \u20ac10.14. The shares have risen 58% in the past year as the airline has recovered from last year\u2019s fall in profits. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, said booming business was the result of lower fares, earlier bookings and the company\u2019s \u201calways getting better\u201d initiative. Ryanair is trying to shed its notoriety for being \u201ccheap and nasty\u201d after losing out to rival easyJet\u2019s improvements in customer service. Ryanair has scrapped a lot of unpopular policies, allowing more carry-on baggage, allocating seating and cutting punitive charges. It has also improved its website and launched a service aimed at business customers. Jacobs said: \u201cWith our new routes, increased frequencies, improving customer experience and Business Plus service, Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than the lowest fares in every market we operate in.\u201d In the year to December, Ryanair\u2019s customer numbers rose 6% to 86.4 million customers. After issuing two profit warnings in the space of two months in 2013, chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary decided Ryanair had to stop \u201cunnecessarily pissing people off\u201d. The combative O\u2019Leary hired Jacobs to upgrade customer service and has kept a lower profile during the image revamp. Last month, Ryanair raised its forecast for profits after tax this year to between \u20ac810m and \u20ac830m (\u00a3636m-\u00a3655m), up from an earlier estimate of \u20ac750m-\u20ac770m. Last year\u2019s figure was \u20ac523m. In the first half of this year, it made \u20ac795m.",

In the latest attempt by policymakers to reduce the need for taxpayer bailouts, banks have been instructed to present their proposals to the Bank by Tuesday \u2013 expected to be submissions running to hundreds of pages of documents. Major banks face having to overhaul the way they run their operations in order to convince the Bank they can protect consumers if their businesses run into trouble. Many will likely be required to create a holding company as well as distinct ringfenced and non-ringfenced entities, each with its own board of directors. No more than one-third of the members of a ringfenced bank\u2019s board may be current employees or directors of another entity in the group \u2013 which may present challenges, given the new regime is being introduced to make bankers more responsible for their actions. Ringfencing the high street from investment banking was recommended by the independent Vickers commission, which was set up in the first year of the coalition government. While banks have a deadline of 1 January 2019 to comply with the rules, Threadneedle Street is demanding evidence that work is under way to protect consumers from the collapse of an investment bank. The requirements could force banks to significantly scale back their investment banking arms and embark on fresh reviews of their strategies. The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has already warned that this could lead to an increase in the costs for consumers, as banks try to pass on the expenses associated with both restructuring and the restrictions on moving resources around their operations. The lenders have known since the autumn that they need to submit their plans by Tuesday \u2013 a deadline that largely affects HSBC, Barclays, Santander\u2019s UK arm and the Co-operative Bank as well as the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. But any bank with deposits of \u00a325bn or more by 2019 could also be expected to submit plans. This has implications for: TSB, which is in the process of being spun out of Lloyds; Williams &amp; Glyn, which is being spun out of RBS; and Virgin Money, the recently floated banking business backed by Sir Richard Branson. Omar Ali, UK head of banking and capital markets at EY, said the timeline for the changes was ambitious given the scale of structural reform that could be forced upon the banks. \u201cThe discussions that take place in the first half of this year based on the initial plans will be critical to the future shape of the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cMany are likely to ask for waivers given the short timeframes for submitting their plans.\u201d When it published its thoughts on ringfenced banks in October, the Bank of England said the submitted plans \u201cwould ideally include provisional UK holding company and UK regulated entity balance sheets and profit and loss statements, enabling supervisors to assess the viability and sustainability of the entities and their level of going and gone-concern capitalisation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "John Lewis boss Andy Street has warned fellow retailers to rein in Black Friday promotions next year after heavy demand over the promotional weekend caused havoc on the high street in the run-up to Christmas and hit profitability. \u201cIt is not in the interests of retailers to continue to grow the pace of Black Friday at the expense of other weeks,\u201d Street said, as he urged fashion stores and other retailers to \u201cplay it down\u201d next year and leave the day focused on electrical goods. Street said John Lewis\u2019s \u201coverall picture\u201d on profitability in the five weeks to 27 December was similar to last year, as underlying sales rose 4.8%. Margins were affected by the concentration of electrical sales into the Black Friday weekend in late November but were helped by a late surge in clothing. Electrical goods were most affected by the American-inspired bargain day on 28 November. Sales proved remarkably volatile, up 6.8% overall during the five weeks to 27 December, but down 14.7% in the last fortnight, compared with a huge 41% rise during Black Friday week. In contrast, sales of fashion rose strongly in the last days before Christmas as Street said shoppers sought out knitwear, beauty and food gifts rather than tablet computers and phones in a last-minute rush. That pattern resulted in a 5.8% rise in fashion and beauty sales over the five weeks to 27 December, despite the impact of the warm autumn. \u201cLast year and 2012 were all about consumer technology, this year there was a more traditional spread of gifting,\u201d said Street. The late surge in fashion sales, which reflects a similar story at Next last week, is potentially good news for major retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams which are set to report their Christmas trading figures in the next 10 days. Analysts have been concerned that fashion chains will suffer, having been forced to offer discounts to clear stocks of coats and jumpers during a balmy autumn. Street said that he believed John Lewis had outpeformed rivals because of its investment in IT and delivery facilities, which meant it was able to meet online orders without any hitches during peak periods, including Black Friday. Sales in established stores fell by about 1% but Street said he would continue to open new outlets because a high street presence was important in supporting the growing online business. More than half of online orders, 56%, were collected in shops over Christmas. John Lewis is set to open three new stores this year, but Street said it would invest more than \u00a3100m in IT this year for the first time, up from an annual spend of just \u00a320m five years ago as it tries to keep up with changing consumer habits. \u201cIt is all very well making sales on Black Friday but you have got to be able to deliver and fulfil them. Operationally things went well for us and we see that as a key competitive battleground and we were well set up to cope [with peaks in demand]. It was clear that some people were not.\u201d Both Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams were among a group of retailers which struggled to cope with high demand on Black Friday. M&amp;S was forced to delay orders and cancel its next-day deliveries to stores as its new hi-tech distribution centre in Castle Donington proved unable to process as many items as expected.",
