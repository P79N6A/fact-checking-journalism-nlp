      "bodyText": "Holidaymakers complained to Thomas Cook about conditions at an all-inclusive hotel in Egypt before two Britons suddenly died there last week, but say they were assured nothing was wrong. Alison Cope from Birmingham said she raised multiple complaints including about being served raw meat and drinks from unwashed glasses prior to the deaths last Tuesday of John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel in Hurghada, which is on the Red Sea. Five people in Cope\u2019s party were among 13 guests who reported illnesses in the last week. Some suffered such uncontrollable diarrhoea that people defecated in the swimming pool on three separate occasions in the last fortnight, Cope told the Guardian. She said the hotel was unable to prevent other guests from jumping in unaware that the pools had yet to be disinfected. One member of her party suffered headaches, breathing difficulties and fluid on the lungs, which a British doctor has since said appear consistent with Legionnaire\u2019s disease, a lung condition that can be carried by contaminated water in air conditioning units. Thomas Cook and the German hotel company Steigenberger said they were carrying out urgent investigations into food and water supplies as well as air conditioning systems after several guests reported stomach and breathing problems. The Coopers\u2019 daughter, Kelly Ormerod, said on Sunday she believed \u201cthere was something in that room that\u2019s actually killed them\u201d and they may have inhaled something that poisoned them. When they went back to their room after dinner there was a funny smell that they covered up with perfume, Ormerod told the BBC. The next morning they didn\u2019t come down for breakfast and she found them \u201cextremely ill\u201d in their room. They had not been suffering from upset stomachs. Susan Cooper worked for Thomas Cook as a travel agent in Burnley. The Red Sea governorate said an initial examination suggested John Cooper suffered acute circulatory collapse and sudden cardiac arrest. His wife was later rushed to hospital after fainting and underwent resuscitation attempts for 30 minutes but died. An inspection of their hotel room found no toxic gas emissions or leaks, the prosecutor\u2019s office said, but investigators for Thomas Cook have so far been denied access to carry out their own tests in the room. The travel firm said there was no evidence of carbon monoxide poisoning from its tests in other parts of the hotel. Steigenberger said it had been told by the office of Egypt\u2019s attorney general that a committee of experts \u201cchecked all equipment and devices in the room and in specific the air conditioners and cooling devices\u201d and \u201creported that no trace of abnormal leaks, no poisoning or harmful gas leakage\u201d. More than half of the 301 Thomas Cook customers at the resort have been flown home but several remain ill. Cope said fish and chicken served in the restaurants was \u201ctotally undercooked\u201d, apparently because the hotel could not keep up with demand. \u201cI would get a drink of water and sometimes the water would taste chemical,\u201d she said. \u201cOther times you would be handed a glass which had been swilled rather than washed. When we asked what they were doing, they said that if they were really dirty they would put them in the dishwasher for 30 seconds. \u201cThere was a barbecue on the beach and another guest bit into the chicken and it was raw in the middle.\u201d Cope said that after members of her family fell ill a few days into their holiday she complained to the Thomas Cook hotel representative but says she was told: \u201cThere\u2019s no problem and no one else has a problem:\u201d She escalated her complaint and was met by a hotel manager and a more senior Thomas Cook representative and \u201cthey dismissed what I was saying\u201d. Thomas Cook confirmed Cope had complained but neither it nor Steigenberger would comment on her claims. \u201cWe are aware that a number of customers have come forward to say they have experienced illness,\u201d a Thomas Cook spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are very sorry for any customers whose holidays have been spoiled. \u201cWe take all illness very seriously and have taken the decision to expand our ongoing investigation into the sudden deaths of two of our customers at the Steigenberger earlier this week to include any other customer reports of illness at the hotel this summer.\u201d Steigenberger said the hotel was operated by a franchisee and that it had launched its own investigation into standards. The German company said it was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the deaths. \u201cWe are really looking carefully to check the facts,\u201d said Sven Hirschler, director of corporate communications.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest payday lender, Wonga, is teetering on the brink of collapse following a surge of customer compensation claims in recent weeks that could cause it to call in administrators. The short-term loan provider has reportedly lined up accountancy firm Grant Thornton to handle a potential administration of the company should its board believe it is unable to avoid falling into insolvency. The report from Sky News said Wonga could appoint Grant Thornton as soon as this week. The flood of claims facing the company relate to loans taken out before 2014, when Wonga was the poster child for outrage in the payday lending industry that resulted in rules capping the cost of borrowing. Campaigners claimed the firm and others in the industry fleeced consumers with high interest rates and targeted vulnerable customers with slick marketing. Wonga has shown signs of mounting difficulties in recent weeks. Earlier this month, it emerged the company received a \u00a310m emergency cash injection from shareholders to save it from going bust. At the time, a spokesman said the firm was facing \u201ca marked increase in claims related to legacy loans, driven principally by claims management company activity\u201d. Should the company fall into administration, it would signal a remarkable fall from its previous status as one of the fastest-growing financial companies in the UK. The company was once touted for a stock exchange listing that could have valued it at more than $1bn (\u00a3780m) but was recently reported to be worth just $30m. Sky News said the recent cash injection from investors had prompted a fresh wave of compensation demands from claims management companies, which have been raking through old loans taken out by consumers. The report also said executives at the company had been in talks with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) over its future in recent weeks. The FCA became responsible for overseeing the payday lending industry and placed a cap on the cost of credit in 2014, which observers say was responsible for pushing smaller payday firms out of the market. Wonga, which employs about 500 people, has reported losses in recent years following the introduction of the cap and several scrapes with the regulator, including a ruling forcing it to compensate customers for unfair debt collection practices. Wonga has been accused in the past by MPs of charging exorbitant interest on short-term loans that amounted to \u201clegal loan sharking\u201d, while was also criticised by the Archbishop of Canterbury for destroying lives. Campaigners say that while payday lenders have reformed since regulators intervened, many households across Britain remain vulnerable. A spokesman for Wonga said the board \u201ccontinues to assess all options regarding the future of the group and all of its entities.\u201d Grant Thornton did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for the FCA declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Keen angler Darren Bailey left school at 16 in the hope of making money doing something he loved. Thirty years on from taking a job in a fishing tackle shop in Norwich, he is chief executive of Angling Direct, a rapidly growing retail business that made its stock market debut a year ago. At a time of great uncertainty on Britain\u2019s high streets, with some of the best known names in retail struggling or going bust, Angling Direct is opening more shops. Its 23rd shop will open its doors to customers in Guildford on 1 September, soon to be followed by a 24th store in Peterborough. The company has identified another 20 other popular fishing locations for future stores. \u201cIt\u2019s a tactile product,\u201d Bailey explains. \u201cPeople like to see it, touch it, feel it. They might wait until a later date to buy it online but they still want to see the products in the shops.\u201d Combined online and store sales jumped 56% to \u00a321.9m in the six months to 31 July, despite extreme weather conditions with the Beast from the East and the prolonged heatwave, which might deter even the most dedicated anglers. The number of shoppers visiting stores did dip over the period, by about 2%, but like-for-like sales \u2013 stripping out sales at shops open for less than a year \u2013 rose 4.2% as the average customer spend increased. Angling Direct sells a vast assortment of more than 21,500 fishing tackle products, ranging from a \u00a31 bag of hooks to poles that will set you back nearly \u00a34,000. The company does not sell through Amazon and, as yet, has not suffered at the hands of the online retailer. Bailey says that while it is always wise to keep an eye on what Amazon is doing \u2013 it does sell some fishing tackle \u2013 he\u2019s not too concerned: \u201cCustomers want specialist service and advice, and you can\u2019t get that from Amazon.\u201d For a business that began with fishing tackle shops in Norfolk, Bailey now has ambitions beyond UK shores. Angling Direct already exports to more than 40 countries and launched a German website in June, with other European websites to follow later in the year. The company floated on the Alternative Investment Market in July last year, to fund the expansion that Bailey is now seeing through. Shares have risen from 64p to 107p over the period. The rapid growth in sales is thanks to that expansion and investment, both in stores and online, rather than an explosion of people taking up fishing as a hobby. \u201cFishing [as a pursuit] is pretty stable. We\u2019re winning on market share, though we are working very hard on bringing new anglers into the sport,\u201d he says. As for his own hobby, Bailey doesn\u2019t get out fishing as much as he would like to these days. He went fishing for the first time in 2018 last week, on the River Trent. The ideal weather for a spot of fishing and a further boost to sales? \u201cI\u2019m hoping for an Indian summer and a normal British winter,\u201d Bailey says.",

      "bodyText": "Before heading off for his summer break Mark Carney said the risks of a no-deal Brexit were uncomfortably high. Last week Philip Hammond warned the Treasury would take an \u00a380bn hit if negotiations between Britain and the EU failed completely. There is a risk to this latest manifestation of Project Fear. If the public really thinks that in eight months\u2019 time Britain is going to be plunged into the economic equivalent of a nuclear winter, the economy will take a serious hit. So far, though, people seem relatively relaxed and haven\u2019t spent the bank holiday weekend stripping supermarket shelves of baked beans and bottled water. While opinion polls show that voters think \u2013 rightly \u2013 that the government is making a pig\u2019s ear of the Brexit negotiations, the state of the economy suggests they are taking what Carney and Hammond say with a pinch of salt. Last week\u2019s survey of manufacturing and retail sales from the CBI were both solid, unemployment was last lower in early 1975, and the public finances smashed expectations last month with the biggest July surplus in almost two decades. If nothing else, the thought that he will have more money to play with in the autumn budget should cheer the chancellor up a bit. While not exactly booming, the UK grew faster than the eurozone in the second quarter and is doing a lot better than the Treasury predicted before the EU referendum. There has been no collapse in house prices, no 500,000 increase in unemployment, no two-year recession. The poor track record of the Treasury (and the Bank of England, for that matter) is one reason consumers and businesses do not appear to be hunkering down for a catastrophic recession next year. What\u2019s more, the scepticism about official forecasting is entirely justified. Neither the Bank nor the Treasury spotted the financial crisis coming and both wildly underestimated the damage it would cause. The economy is now about 15% smaller than it would have been had its pre-recession growth rate continued, something that took the Bank, the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility (the body that now does Hammond\u2019s economic forecasts) by surprise. So the Treasury\u2019s confident assertion that the economy could be 10% smaller by 2030 in the event of a no-deal Brexit needs to be treated with caution. No question, the warnings from Carney and Hammond have some impact. The governor and the chancellor are responsible for the economy and they make headline news. What they say matters. But their influence can be overstated, because most people are too busy getting on with their lives to worry about whether the Bank and the Treasury are radiating gloom and despondency. Interest in, and awareness of, political developments is much less than imagined. People tune in just before elections, make up their minds based \u2013 to a considerable extent \u2013 on how well they and their families are faring, vote, and then tune out again. When David Cameron won the 2015 election, voters thought that was it for another five years. Theresa May\u2019s mistake was to ask them to go to the polls only two years later and, even worse, to do so when living standards were falling as a result of the post-referendum fall in the value of the pound. There could hardly have been a worse time to call an election than in mid-term when real incomes were falling and the electorate was suffering from austerity fatigue. The summer of 2018 would not have been a perfect time to fight an election either but it would have been better than June 2017. Inflation has started to come down because the impact of sterling\u2019s fall has faded, and this has resulted in gently rising real incomes. Unemployment has continued to fall \u2013 it is now below 4% \u2013 and there are plenty of job vacancies. Most people who want a job can find one, even if it is not the sort of job they want, with the hours they want, at the pay rates they want. Taken together, rising incomes plus greater job security means people are less gloomy about their own finances than they are about the prospects for the economy as a whole. Understandably, perhaps, businesses have been more cautious about investment but just as there have been companies threatening to leave the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit there have been high-profile examples \u2013 such as Google and Apple \u2013 of companies announcing plans to expand in Britain. The assumption these multinational companies are making is that Britain is not going to crash out of the EU next March because eventually a deal will be done. Financial markets think the same, putting the chances of no deal at 10%. This is a reasonable assumption. The history of EU negotiations is that victory is snatched from the jaws of defeat with an agreement made at the very last minute. With the eurozone economy not in especially good health, there is no real appetite in any European capital for a no-deal outcome. Clearly, it makes sense to be prepared for all Brexit outcomes, but the public has yet to take seriously the more lurid warnings of apocalypse to come. Expert forecasting is discredited. Life is a bit better than it was a year ago. There is still an expectation that London and Brussels will orchestrate a political fix. For all these reasons, people don\u2019t really believe that at the end of March 2019 there will be no food in the shops, hospitals will be running short of medicines and that planes will be prevented from flying. A no-deal Brexit is seen as another millennium bug.",

    "webTitle": "Trump sees win with push to reform quarterly earnings reports", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Donald Trump may be roiling financial markets, threatening to widen a trade war or predicting \u201cthe market would crash\u201d if he is impeached, but one presidential endorsement has some American CEOs cheering. Last week, the president tweeted that he had asked the world\u2019s \u201ctop business leaders\u201d what would improve their lives. Their answer? Stop the current system of reporting earnings every three months and move to a six-month system. \u201cThat would allow greater flexibility &amp; save money,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cI have asked the SEC to study!\u201d American CEOs loved Trump\u2019s tax cuts. But since then they have increasingly been at odds with the White House on subjects ranging from immigration to trade. Reform of the earnings calendar might win Trump a few more fans back. Why the idea of changing the quarterly earning system should come up now isn\u2019t hard to grasp. In June, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase; Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway; and the Business Roundtable, an association of nearly 200 CEOs from major companies, penned a joint letter titled Short-Termism Is Harming the Economy. Reporting company results four times a year is just too much, they argued. In view of their \u201cresponsibility to leave behind a stronger, more prosperous society than the one [they] found\u201d the CEOs called on public companies to consider moving away from providing quarterly earnings per share guidance. \u201cIn our experience,\u201d they wrote, \u201cquarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.\u201d Quarterly earnings per share guidance had contributed to a shift away from long-term investments and \u201ccaused companies to hold back on technology spending, hiring and research and development to meet quarterly earnings forecasts\u201d. Moreover, Dimon and Buffett said, the pressure had contributed to the decline in the number of public companies in America over the past two decades. Their proposal, they said, built on a Commonsense Corporate Governance Principles manifesto US business leaders developed in 2016 and would advance business practices that \u201ccreate value for millions of Americans without sacrificing the transparency and accountability that investors deserve\u201d. The idea was then picked up by the outgoing PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi who, Trump later reported, had told him over dinner at his golf retreat in New Jersey: \u201cTwo-time-a-year reporting, not quarterly.\u201d The idea has some academic backing, too. Tensie Whelan, founding director of New York University\u2019s Stern\u2019s Center for Sustainable Business, recently wrote that the need to hit quarterly targets had led to \u201cunprecedented share buybacks which artificially boost stock prices, non-strategic cost-cutting, less investment in longer-term basic and applied research (versus product development), as well as an unhealthy pressure on labor costs\u201d. Quarterly reporting began in the US in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash when regulators wanted to give investors a more frequent opportunity to look under the hood of the publicly traded companies they were investing in. The US Chamber of Commerce thinks scaling back reporting frequency because what befitted a 1930s-era disclosure system \u201cno longer meets the needs of a 21st-century economy\u201d. Others, like the former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt, argue there should be a deal in which regulators offer to reduce frequency of reporting if investors get information about changes more quickly. He told the Wall Street Journal that the aim of reducing reporting costs is \u201csomething that investors should want as well\u201d. While flipping back to to a biannual system would bring the US in line with Europe, which scrapped rules requiring quarterly earnings reports after the global financial crisis as part of a drive to reduce the bureaucratic burden on businesses, others believe that cutting down the frequency of financial performance information doesn\u2019t solve the underlying problem of earnings manipulation. \u201cIf you bring it down to twice a year then you\u2019ll get manipulation twice a year instead,\u201d argues Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cIf the goal is to eliminate earnings manipulation, this isn\u2019t the way to do it.\u2019 Elson argues that quarterly reporting is like the speedometer in a car, useful to check once in awhile but not crucial to the overall journey. The only number with any significance for judging a business, he says, is the year-end number. Getting rid of quarterly reporting, he says, is \u201ca solution in search of a problem\u201d. If there is an issue, it\u2019s about how management communicates with analysts, he says. \u201cA management that plays with numbers ultimately gets discovered. If you have a bad quarter and can explain why, people give you the benefit of doubt \u2013 that\u2019s called communication.\u201d The best way to solve the issue of \u201cshort-termism\u201d identified by Dimon, Buffett and Business Roundtable is not to offer less information because that doesn\u2019t solve the issue of poor management. \u201cIt\u2019s not that what they are suggesting is terrible it\u2019s just not a solution to the problem they\u2019re responding to,\u201d Elson says. \u201cThe way to avoid mismanagement is for the board to insist that management runs the company not for a quarter but for long-term results.\u201d The proposal to maintain or scrap quarterly earnings reporting ultimately falls under the purview of the SEC. The commission chairman, Jay Clayton, said in a statement that Trump had \u201chighlighted a key consideration for American companies and, importantly, American investors and their families \u2013 encouraging long-term investment in our country\u201d. Whether or not that will prove to be the case remains to be seen.",

But since then they have increasingly been at odds with the White House on subjects ranging from immigration to trade. Reform of the earnings calendar might win Trump a few more fans back.</p> <p>Why the idea of changing the quarterly earning system should come up now isn\u2019t hard to grasp.</p> <p>In June, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase; Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway; and the Business Roundtable, an association of nearly 200 CEOs from major companies, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-termism-is-harming-the-economy-1528336801\">penned a joint letter</a> titled Short-Termism Is Harming the Economy.</p> <p>Reporting company results four times a year is just too much, they argued. In view of their \u201cresponsibility to leave behind a stronger, more prosperous society than the one [they] found\u201d the CEOs called on public companies to consider moving away from providing quarterly earnings per share guidance.</p> <p>\u201cIn our experience,\u201d they wrote, \u201cquarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.\u201d</p> <p>Quarterly earnings per share guidance had contributed to a shift away from long-term investments and \u201ccaused companies to hold back on technology spending, hiring and research and development to meet quarterly earnings forecasts\u201d.</p> <p>Moreover, Dimon and Buffett said, the pressure had contributed to the decline in the number of public companies in America over the past two decades.</p> <p>Their proposal, they said, built on a <a href=\"http://www.governanceprinciples.org/?mod=article_inline\">Commonsense Corporate Governance Principles</a> manifesto US business leaders developed in 2016 and would advance business practices that \u201ccreate value for millions of Americans without sacrificing the transparency and accountability that investors deserve\u201d.</p> <p>The idea was then picked up by the outgoing PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi who, Trump later reported, had told him over dinner at his golf retreat in New Jersey: \u201cTwo-time-a-year reporting, not quarterly.\u201d</p> <p>The idea has some academic backing, too. Tensie Whelan, founding director of New York University\u2019s Stern\u2019s Center for Sustainable Business,<a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/23/news/trump-quarterly-reporting/index.html\"> recently wrote</a> that the need to hit quarterly targets had led to \u201cunprecedented share buybacks which artificially boost stock prices, non-strategic cost-cutting, less investment in longer-term basic and applied research (versus product development), as well as an unhealthy pressure on labor costs\u201d.</p> <p>Quarterly reporting began in the US in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash when regulators wanted to give investors a more frequent opportunity to look under the hood of the publicly traded companies they were investing in.</p> <p>The US Chamber of Commerce thinks scaling back reporting frequency because what befitted a 1930s-era disclosure system \u201cno longer meets the needs of a 21st-century economy\u201d.</p> <p>Others, like the former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt, argue there should be a deal in which regulators offer to reduce frequency of reporting if investors get information about changes more quickly.</p> <p>He told the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-directs-sec-to-study-six-month-reporting-for-public-companies-1534507058\">Wall Street Journal</a> that the aim of reducing reporting costs is \u201csomething that investors should want as well\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top US stories every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4152\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Guardian Today - US edition\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of editors' picks and the biggest headlines each morning.\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you our picks of the most important headlines.\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the top US stories every morning </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While flipping back to to a biannual system would bring the US in line with Europe, which scrapped rules requiring quarterly earnings reports after the global financial crisis as part of a drive to reduce the bureaucratic burden on businesses, others believe that cutting down the frequency of financial performance information doesn\u2019t solve the underlying problem of earnings manipulation.</p> <p>\u201cIf you bring it down to twice a year then you\u2019ll get manipulation twice a year instead,\u201d argues Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cIf the goal is to eliminate earnings manipulation, this isn\u2019t the way to do it.\u2019</p> <p>Elson argues that quarterly reporting is like the speedometer in a car, useful to check once in awhile but not crucial to the overall journey.

More recently, however, the coalfields were so run down that, before the carbon tax was introduced in 2013, we were importing coal from Russia and South America for power stations not that far from Newcastle. The miners were very important in Labour party history. When, in the early postwar years, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was being formed, the possibility of our joining was peremptorily dismissed by Herbert Morrison, foreign secretary in the Attlee government, with the words \u201cthe Durham miners won\u2019t wear it\u201d. Coal and steel were integral to the production of instruments of war. It should never be forgotten, during these strange times when most foreigners one meets think this country has taken leave of its senses, that the ECSC, which evolved into the Common Market, was seen as a way of binding nations closely together, so that another war \u2013 Germany and France had been at it in 1870, 1914 and 1940 \u2013 would be unthinkable. These geopolitical considerations are seldom far from my mind. Since I regard Brexit as the biggest British economic folly I have ever had to cover, it is the economic damage that I concentrate on. But there is an obvious worry, if we do head for a \u201cno-deal\u201d exit, that there could be wider geopolitical ramifications, at a time when Trump and his friend Putin seem to be set on causing as much damage to the EU as they can. The prospect of the self-harm that is Brexit began as a futile attempt by David Cameron to settle divisions on Europe within the Tory party once and for all. Instead he exacerbated them, with the reductio ad absurdum that the leading Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, while moving his financial operations to Dublin, blithely tells us that it might take 50 years to reap the so-called \u201cbenefits\u201d of Brexit. It is a pity that Cameron did not study the way in which the former Labour MP George Cunningham (who died last month) designed his amendment to the Scotland bill of 1978. That was the bill for prime minister James Callaghan\u2019s proposal for Scottish devolution. The referendum the following year led to the defeat of the bill and then the collapse of the Callaghan government in a no-confidence motion. (It was this, and not, as often supposed, the 1978-79 \u201cwinter of discontent\u201d, that brought down Callaghan, although the reaction to the winter of discontent certainly figured prominently in the election that followed.) Cunningham\u2019s cunning amendment required a certain percentage \u2013 40% \u2013 of the entire electorate to approve of devolution. Thus, although 51.6% of those who voted favoured devolution, they constituted only 32.9% of the electorate. Scottish devolution was postponed for almost 20 years. It cannot be repeated often enough that when Theresa May says she has to honour the result of the referendum, she is proposing to honour the recorded views of a mere 37% of the electorate. Now, whenever I have asked some Labour MPs why, frankly, they have been so supine on this issue, when they regard Brexit as damagingly absurd, their answers have indicated that because they represented Leave constituencies, they were frightened of losing their seats (sometimes this would be put in the context of wanting to honour the views of their constituents, you understand). Well, the poll reported a fortnight ago in this newspaper indicated that in Labour\u2019s heartlands, \u201cmore than 100 Leave seats now back Remain\u201d. Moreover, another recent poll found that 79% of voters aged 18-24 support remaining in the EU. The welcome movement of opinion partly reflects disgust with the way this embarrassingly poor government is handling the issue. But, more importantly, perceptions of the damage that the mere prospect of Brexit is now inflicting appear to be strengthening. It is surely time for Labour to get its act together when parliament reassembles and help to save the nation from further humiliation. When pressed last week on the Today programme, the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, refused to be drawn into ruling out another referendum. He emphasised that he was keeping options open. The truth is that a no-deal Brexit is the worst option, but other forms of Brexit are damaging in their own way. The only sensible option is to remain in the EU that the predecessors of Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn fought so hard to join. And the legacy of the Durham miners?

      "bodyText": "Impeach me and the stock market gets it. There were unmistakable echoes of a mob boss in a gangster movie when Donald Trump insisted that any such action against him would bring an abrupt end to what is now the longest bull market in history. It is a sign of a backs-to-the-wall mentality at the White House that Trump felt the need to lash out in this way. Presidents usually go out of their way to avoid saying anything that might give Wall Street cause for concern. Not this one. The market would crash, Trump said. Everyone would be very poor. The warning shows just how crucial Trump thinks a rising stock market is to his political appeal. You might not like me much, he is suggesting, but look what\u2019s happened to your share portfolio since my election in November 2016. What\u2019s more, Trump is partly right. There is no doubt that a bitter impeachment battle \u2013 especially since it inevitably would be long drawn out \u2013 would rattle Wall Street. Financial markets hate uncertainty. It is also the case that Trump\u2019s agenda has helped to push up share prices. He has cut taxes on American corporations, which has boosted profits. He has also slashed regulation. Both are positive for markets. Trump campaigned as a man who would deliver for the little guy: he has governed in the interests of big business. But all bull markets come to an end sooner or later, and there are already signs that the second 18 months of Trump\u2019s presidency will be a choppier time for Wall Street than the first, impeachment or no impeachment. And if, as some believe, 2019 is a dire year for the stock market, Trump himself will have only himself to blame. First, his tax cuts were ill-timed. They have pumped up demand late in the business cycle, raising concerns at the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, that the economy is in danger of overheating. Trump\u2019s crude attempts to pressurise the Fed into slowing the pace of interest rate increases will not work. The next increase in borrowing costs will happen next month, and eventually tighter borrowing costs will slow the economy, affecting corporate earnings. The fact that the Fed has moved further and faster to normalise monetary policy has also led to a stronger dollar, and that affects the earnings that US companies make on their sales overseas. Trump seems to be setting up Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed, to be the fall guy if there is a market correction. Secondly, there is Trump\u2019s aggressive trade agenda, which is starting to affect the US economy in a number of ways. At the most basic level, tariffs push up the cost of imports, which add to business costs and so eat into corporate profit margins. Tariffs also hurt other countries, and the reduction in global growth has a knock-on effect on US exports. The companies in the S&amp;P 500 make 40% of their earnings outside America. Then there\u2019s the impact on business confidence. The psychological effects of protectionism were limited while US companies believed Trump\u2019s belligerence was all an act. But as the rhetoric has hardened and sabre-rattling has threatened to turn into a full-scale trade war, businesses have become more and more alarmed. The risk is that Trump may use trade as a diversionary tactic in order to deflect attention from the investigations into his dealings. Wall Street could continue to rise for a while. But by the start of next year the boost from tax cuts will be fading, interest rate increases will be starting to bite, the global economy will be slowing as a result of protectionism, and the midterm elections could result in a Congress much more hostile to Trump. The message to investors is clear: a big market correction is lurking out there. And it is not all that far away. Oil and gas can\u2019t fuel Scottish independence Higher oil prices have helped Scotland cut its deficit, giving Nicola Sturgeon, the country\u2019s first minister, something to cheer last week. The question of how much oil and gas revenues could power an independent Scotland was debated during the referendum campaign four years ago. On the face of it, the latest deficit numbers and North Sea\u2019s mini-revival of four years of production growth, have strengthened the hand of Scottish nationalists. The region\u2019s firms have leaner operating costs after the oil price slump, smaller independent players are buying up fields to eke out the last hydrocarbons and crude prices are up. But to focus on the short-term would be to miss the bigger picture. The North Sea\u2019s renaissance is coming to an end, with production expected to resume its trajectory of long-term decline next year. Oil and gas output is projected to fall nearly a fifth in five years, to 1.38 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. After 2023, production is expected to decline 5% a year. Those are the projections of a boosterish regulator, not Greenpeace. The reality could be worse. Declining production is not the only issue. Oil prices might look bullish due to the geopolitics of today, but there are bearish elements too \u2013 Opec is pumping more and the US will eventually clear bottlenecks in shale regions. Crude prices are impossible to predict. Then there is the cost of cleaning up old rigs, a burden that falls on taxpayers to a certain extent because of tax relief. The government could also increase its tax take from the sector, a prospect that prompted apocalyptic warnings from the industry regulator. There are many strong arguments for why an independent Scotland could succeed. North Sea oil and gas revenues are unlikely to among them. Even 007 has to work hard to keep Hollywood happy In Hollywood, creative risk is always balanced against the necessity of a decent box office return. Even a character as cavalier as James Bond would appreciate that. And that no doubt was one of the factors behind Danny Boyle\u2019s decision to quit as director of the 25th 007 film, although the producers cited \u201ccreative differences\u201d. The James Bond franchise is a dependable hit machine for Hollywood in an era when, thanks to the rise of Netflix and YouTube, just foisting a big film and a large marketing budget on the public is no guarantee of ticket sales. But figures for the last entry in the Bond series, Spectre, show that 007 has to work very hard to generate a decent return on a big-budget investment. Spectre cost $245m (\u00a3190m) and made $880m at the global box office. According to film website Deadline, the breakdown of revenue share from the film saw the Broccoli family \u2013 which owns the copyright to Bond on screen \u2013 take $50m, with about $10m for Ian Fleming\u2019s estate and a total pay deal of around $11m for actor Daniel Craig (of which around $7m was upfront anyway). This left a net profit of $98m for the film\u2019s distributors, Sony and MGM, who split the cost of the budget 50/50. On those numbers it is evident that Spectre, a big and brash blockbuster, needed a big box-office performance to leave its backers satisfied. As Deadline said: \u201cAnyone taking on the 007 property will be looking at working very hard for comparably small profits, when all the splits and payouts are factored in.\u201d The Broccolis and the new film\u2019s distributors need the next Bond to hit Spectre-style numbers. In that context, Boyle\u2019s reportedly radical pitch for the franchise \u2013 with more topical themes than usual and a Russian villain \u2013 was always in danger of being in the ejector seat.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45285585\">Impeach me and the stock market gets it.</a> There were unmistakable echoes of a mob boss in a gangster movie when Donald Trump insisted that any such action against him would bring an abrupt end to what is now the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/22/wall-street-record-longest-rally-history-bull-market\">longest bull market in history</a>.</p> <p>It is a sign of a backs-to-the-wall mentality at the White House that Trump felt the need to lash out in this way. Presidents usually go out of their way to avoid saying anything that might give Wall Street cause for concern. Not this one. The market would crash, Trump said. Everyone would be very poor.</p> <p>The warning shows just how crucial Trump thinks a rising stock market is to his political appeal. You might not like me much, he is suggesting, but look what\u2019s happened to your share portfolio since my election in November 2016.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, Trump is partly right. There is no doubt that a bitter impeachment battle \u2013 especially since it inevitably would be long drawn out \u2013 would rattle Wall Street. Financial markets hate uncertainty.</p> <p>It is also the case that Trump\u2019s agenda has helped to push up share prices. He has cut taxes on American corporations, which has boosted profits. He has also slashed regulation. Both are positive for markets. Trump campaigned as a man who would deliver for the little guy: he has governed in the interests of big business.</p> <p>But all bull markets come to an end sooner or later, and there are already signs that the second 18 months of Trump\u2019s presidency will be a choppier time for Wall Street than the first, impeachment or no impeachment. And if, as some believe, 2019 is a dire year for the stock market, Trump himself will have only himself to blame.</p> <p>First, his tax cuts were ill-timed. They have pumped up demand late in the business cycle, raising concerns at the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, that the economy is in danger of overheating. Trump\u2019s crude attempts to pressurise the Fed into slowing the pace of interest rate increases will not work. The next increase in borrowing costs will happen next month, and eventually tighter borrowing costs will slow the economy, affecting corporate earnings.</p> <p>The fact that the Fed has moved further and faster to normalise monetary policy has also led to a stronger dollar, and that affects the earnings that US companies make on their sales overseas. Trump seems to be setting up Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed, to be the fall guy if there is a market correction.</p> <p>Secondly, there is Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/us-china-escalate-trade-war-total-sum-levied-reaches-100bn\">aggressive trade agenda,</a> which is starting to affect the US economy in a number of ways. At the most basic level, tariffs push up the cost of imports, which add to business costs and so eat into corporate profit margins.</p> <p>Tariffs also hurt other countries, and the reduction in global growth has a knock-on effect on US exports. The companies in the S&amp;P 500 make 40% of their earnings outside America.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the impact on business confidence. The psychological effects of protectionism were limited while US companies believed Trump\u2019s belligerence was all an act. But as the rhetoric has hardened and sabre-rattling has threatened to turn into a full-scale trade war, businesses have become more and more alarmed. The risk is that Trump may use trade as a diversionary tactic in order to deflect attention from the investigations into his dealings.</p> <p>Wall Street could continue to rise for a while. But by the start of next year the boost from tax cuts will be fading, interest rate increases will be starting to bite, the global economy will be slowing as a result of protectionism, and the midterm elections could result in a Congress much more hostile to Trump. The message to investors is clear: a big market correction is lurking out there. And it is not all that far away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ed021437b74459e9fa716c0999f49d88392fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ed021437b74459e9fa716c0999f49d88392fcb/0_0_4108_2464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil Rigs in the Cromarty Firth awaiting decommissioning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil Rigs in the Cromarty Firth awaiting decommissioning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Oil and gas can\u2019t fuel Scottish independence</h2> <p>Higher oil prices have helped Scotland cut its deficit, giving Nicola Sturgeon, the country\u2019s first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/22/scotland-cuts-its-deficit-but-is-still-outspending-the-uk\">something to cheer last week</a>.</p> <p>The question of how much oil and gas revenues could power an independent Scotland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/21/questions-value-scotland-north-sea-oil-highlighted\">was debated during the referendum campaign four years ago</a>.

After 2023, production is expected to decline 5% a year. Those are <a href=\"https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/media/4647/projections-of-uk-oil-and-gas-production-and-expenditure-march-2018.pdf\">the projections of a boosterish regulator</a>, not Greenpeace. The reality could be worse.</p> <p>Declining production is not the only issue. Oil prices might look bullish due to the geopolitics of today, but there are bearish elements too \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/22/oil-output-set-to-rise-by-1m-barrels-a-day-in-opec-deal-saudi-energy-minister\">Opec is pumping more</a> and the US will eventually clear bottlenecks in shale regions. Crude prices are impossible to predict.</p> <p>Then there is the cost of cleaning up old rigs, a burden that falls on taxpayers to a certain extent because of tax relief. The government could also increase its tax take from the sector, a prospect that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7886149c-a52a-11e8-8ecf-a7ae1beff35b\">prompted apocalyptic warnings from the industry regulator</a>.</p> <p>There are many strong arguments for why an independent Scotland could succeed.

The DIY chain is approaching a crunch moment, with landlords set to vote this week on a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), designed to put the company on a sound financial footing. CVAs have emerged as the theme of 2018 for struggling high street retail and hospitality sectors. They are designed to give businesses financial breathing space by asking landlords to agree to rent cuts, usually accompanied by the closure of some loss-making stores. In this case, that\u2019s rather a lot of them. Around 70% of Homebase branches make a loss, according to a report in the Financial Times. Agreeing a CVA can dramatically reduce overheads for bricks-and-mortar chains paying rent on dozens or hundreds of properties around the country. Landlords considering whether to back such deals must weigh up whether they would rather help valued tenants survive to pay rent another day, albeit at reduced rates, or risk seeing them collapse altogether. It seems like a no-brainer. Some rent is better than no rent after all, particularly when an uncertain economic backdrop means finding new tenants could prove tricky. But the sheer volume of CVAs has become almost farcical, with applicants so far this year including House of Fraser, Carluccio\u2019s, Mothercare, Jamie\u2019s Italian, Prezzo, Byron, New Look and Carpetright. This has led to accusations from the property industry that retailers see CVAs as a cheap and easy way to force landlords to bail them out, when other remedies might be available. Amid building anger, Homebase needs to secure the support of 75% of its landlords for the CVA to go ahead. Even if Homebase gets the votes it needs, the burgeoning list of CVAs is a symptom of wider malaise on the high street that shows no sign of abating given industry trends. Traditional retailers are under threat from online competitors with low overheads, particularly Amazon. The globe-straddling retail colossus could now benefit from the conditions it has helped to create. Amazon is reportedly keen to snap up some of the sites vacated by Homebase which, unlike town-centre retailers, owns many of its properties. Amazon could use these handily situated venues as mini-warehouses to boost its ability to deliver within short timeframes. A spokesperson declined to comment on whether Amazon would bid on any of the properties but it has plenty of cash to do so, having halved its already meagre UK corporation tax contribution to just \u00a34.5m last year. One major area of expansion for Amazon is food delivery and supermarkets are reportedly nervous. How long before traditional supermarkets, like high street shops before them, fall victim to a ruthlessly efficient competitor with tiny overheads and a minuscule tax bill? The comic writer and producer Armando Iannuci once wrote a sketch that envisaged a future in which Tesco was so ubiquitous that it ran out of space in the UK and was forced to invade Denmark.

      "bodyText": "Directors who have dissolved companies to avoid paying workers or pensions could be disqualified or fined by authorities for the first time. The move is part of a government initiative to safeguard workers, pensions and small suppliers when a company goes bust. The Observer reported in January that the government was preparing to crack down on irresponsible company bosses in the wake of the collapse of Carillion. The construction and outsourcing giant went into liquidation with a deficit in its pension scheme of \u00a3900m. Other major company collapses that have forced the government to action include the demise in 2016 of the BHS chain formerly owned by Sir Philip Green which had a pensions deficit of more than \u00a3500m. Theresa May said then that while governments should not get involved in day-to-day management of businesses, the state should now act \u201cin favour of ordinary working people\u201d. The government has revealed details of how these measures \u2013 which will be set out in further detail in the autumn \u2013 will be implemented. Under the shake-up, bosses will face investigation if they try to escape paying a dissolved company\u2019s debts to their own staff and creditors. The Insolvency Service will then be able to fine directors, or even have them disqualified, if they fall short of standards. In addition, companies are to be given more time to rescue their businesses, either by restructuring or by seeking new investment. At the same time, shareholders will be given more powers to hold boardrooms to account. The government will also announce measures to improve the quality of directors\u2019 work by developing proposals to introduce better training to make them more aware of their legal duties, while the Investment Association will be given powers to ensure bosses cannot reward investors when firms are in financial distress. \u201cWe are upgrading our corporate governance to give new powers to authorities to investigate and hold responsible directors who attempt to shy away from their responsibilities,\u201d said business minister Kelly Tolhurst.",

The move is part of a government initiative to safeguard workers, pensions and small suppliers when a company goes bust.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> reported in January that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/20/theresa-may-i-will-fine-greedy-bosses\" title=\"\"> the government was preparing to crack down on irresponsible company bosses</a> in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/15/carillion-what-went-wrong-liquidation-staff\" title=\"\">the collapse of Carillion</a>. The construction and outsourcing giant went into liquidation with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/19/frank-field-demands-answers-over-reckless-running-of-carillion\" title=\"\">deficit in its pension scheme of \u00a3900m.</a></p> <p>Other major company collapses that have forced the government to action include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/sir-philip-green-clashes-with-tv-reporter\" title=\"\">the demise in 2016 of the BHS</a> chain formerly owned by Sir Philip Green which had a pensions deficit of more than \u00a3500m.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/20/theresa-may-i-will-fine-greedy-bosses\" title=\"\">Theresa May</a> said then that while governments should not get involved in day-to-day management of businesses, the state should now act \u201cin favour of ordinary working people\u201d.</p> <p>The government has revealed details of how these measures \u2013 which will be set out in further detail in the autumn \u2013 will be implemented. Under the shake-up, bosses will face investigation if they try to escape paying a dissolved company\u2019s debts to their own staff and creditors. The Insolvency Service will then be able to fine directors, or even have them disqualified, if they fall short of standards.</p> <p>In addition, companies are to be given more time to rescue their businesses, either by restructuring or by seeking new investment. At the same time, shareholders will be given more powers to hold boardrooms to account.</p> <p>The government will also announce measures to improve the quality of directors\u2019 work by developing proposals to introduce better training to make them more aware of their legal duties, while the Investment Association will be given powers to ensure bosses cannot reward investors when firms are in financial distress.</p> <p>\u201cWe are upgrading our corporate governance to give new powers to authorities to investigate and hold responsible directors who attempt to shy away from their responsibilities,\u201d said business minister Kelly Tolhurst.</p>",
