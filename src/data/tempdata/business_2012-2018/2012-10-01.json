      "bodyText": "The Bank of England leapt to the defence on Monday of its new scheme to encourage housebuying after figures revealed that a recovery in mortgage lending has gone into reverse. According to figures from Threadneedle Street, households repaid more debt than they borrowed in August, despite the launch of the Bank's Funding for Lending scheme as an \u00a380bn scheme to cut the cost of mortgage borrowing. The amount of new loans to households fell by \u00a3400m and the previous figure for July was reduced, the Bank of England said. But it denied the decline undermined the case for offering banks cheap credit through the Funding for Lending scheme. A spokesman said: \"Early indications suggest the FLS is having an impact, but it is unrealistic to expect to see that in lending figures for August.\" Lending figures and mortgage approvals have remained stubbornly low throughout 2012. The Bank of England said in the summer the rising cost of mortgage borrowing was hitting demand and deterring homebuyers from entering the property market. It warned that UK banks were pushing up mortgage rates after being viewed as vulnerable to the collapse of the eurozone, forcing foreign banks to increase the cost of loans to the UK banking sector. Funding for Lending provides UK banks with cheap funds linked to a commitment from lenders to pass on the benefits to homebuyers. Thirteen financial institutions, accounting for about 73% of UK lending, have signed up to the programme. Paul Fisher, head of financial markets at the Bank of England, said last month that it would take until at least the end of the year before the success of the scheme could be judged. The poor lending data added to renewed economic gloom from the manufacturing sector and figures showing a sharp drop in petrol consumption. While environmental groups are expected to welcome news that fuel consumption has dropped, it will alarm economic forecasters who expect a strong pickup in activity in the second half of the year. The AA said petrol sales tumbled in the last quarter at the fastest rate since the financial crash. It said the fall had gathered momentum after a steady decline during the first half of this year. Petrol sales between April and June declined by 497m litres compared to last year's second quarter. The statistics from the Department of Energy and Climate Change show that, overall, more than two billion fewer litres of petrol and diesel were sold on forecourts in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2008. UK manufacturing activity dropped again in September as financial data provider Markit said the UK had suffered from the crisis in the eurozone. Chief European economist Chris Williamson said: \"Overseas sales continue to be hit by the ongoing deterioration in global economic growth, with the eurozone \u2013 the UK's largest export market \u2013 at the epicentre of the weakness.\" The Markit PMI survey for September came in at 48.4, dropping further below 50, the mark that separates expansion from contraction. It fell short of analyst expectations of 49.3, and compares with August's reading of 49.6. UK manufacturers suffered a double blow of falling output and rising costs. Companies said the decrease in output was caused by a decline in new export business and subdued demand at home. Costs surged in September, driven by the rising price of chemicals, energy, food, metals, oil and plastics.",

On his first day in the office after his arrival from Roche, Soriot suspended this year's $4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) share buy-back programme with only half the cash spent. Removing a perceived short-term prop to the share price tends to go down badly, at least with investors who are focused on such things. But suspension looks the right decision for the company's long-term health. In broad terms, Soriot's task at AstraZeneca is clear: he has to use the abundant current cash flows to reinvent the business for the time when patent expiries of big-selling drugs bite. And that time starts now: first-half revenues were down 15%. So critical decisions have to be made on how much cash to allocate for internal research on new drugs (probably not much more than currently) and how much for development of drugs that arrive via in-licensing and partnership deals (probably a lot more). But buy-backs are a distraction until that debate is settled. In this context, it is intriguing to note the share market's and the bond market's wildly different assessments of the odds on a successful reinvention of AstraZeneca. The shares are priced at a miserable 7.5 times this year's expected earnings and carry a dividend yield of 6%, which is the sort of rating associated with companies whose survival for the next decade or so is less than certain.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "JJB Sports, once Britain's biggest sports retailer, finally collapsed into administration last night after weeks of negotiations failed to secure the future of 133 shops and 2,200 staff. The Wigan-based company, which was worth more than \u00a31bn in its heyday, called in administrators from KPMG on Monday after attempts to sell the business foundered, despite initial interest from more than 100 parties including the company's founder Dave Whelan. The administrators only managed to sell 20 JJB stores, the brand and the website to its arch-rival Sports Direct for \u00a324m, saving 550 jobs in the UK, including warehouse staff. The shops are expected to be rebranded as Sports Direct. Sports Direct, controlled by Newcastle United FC owner Mike Ashley, has also snapped up all of JJB's stock and the Slazenger Golf brand licences, as well as the company's headquarters in Wigan, a freehold property. However, the remaining 133 JJB stores shut on Monday leaving 2,200 people out of work. Some 167 employees have been retained to help the administrators but will lose their jobs once their work is done. The sale proceeds will be used to repay some of JJB's \u00a345m debt to its lender, Lloyds Banking Group and other secured creditors, US group Dick's Sporting Goods and Adidas. But shareholders will go empty-handed, while suppliers \u2013 Nike, Adidas and Umbro \u2013 and landlords will get very little, if anything. The shares were worth less than a penny when they were suspended. There had been hopes that Whelan, a former Blackburn Rovers footballer who is now chairman of Wigan Athletic, would step in to save the stricken company that he founded in 1971 when he turned a Wigan fishing tackle shop, JJ Bradburns, into a sports store. In 1994, the 120-store chain floated on the London Stock Exchange and four years later, the acquisition of Sports Division, its largest competitor at the time, turned it into the largest sports retailer in the UK. Richard Fleming, UK head of restructuring at KPMG, said: \"Successive attempts to restructure the business, both financially and operationally, have not been enough to prevent the company falling into administration. Unfortunately a buyer could only be found for 20 stores on a going-concern basis.\" All staff made redundant have had their arrears of wages and holiday entitlements paid in full. David McCorquodale, corporate finance partner at KPMG who led the sales process, said he and his team had spoken to more than 100 parties in the first few days of their appointment and eight trade and private equity players went on to table first round bids. \"Unfortunately the level of cash and further operational restructuring required to rescue a more substantial part of the business was too much risk for most interested parties,\" he said. \"We hope to be able to sell the leasehold interests of some of the remaining stores, which may result in re-employment of some staff.\" JJB never recovered after a series of poor acquisitions saddled it with debt during chief executive Chris Ronnie's tenure between 2007 and 2009, although some believe its problems started much earlier. Analysts say JJB's management lacked the expertise to keep up with Sports Direct's aggressive expansion and strategy of acquiring brands such as Lonsdale and Dunlop, while JJB's clothing business was also hammered by competition from supermarkets and discount chains such as Primark. Two company voluntary arrangements in 2009 and 2011 \u2013 legal agreements designed to reduce rent costs for struggling retailers \u2013 shrank the store portfolio but failed to save the business. JJB put itself up for sale in August this year after warning it could run out of money. It had been kept afloat thanks to the support of a core group of investors \u2013 Invesco, Harris Associates, Crystal Amber and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 but by then shareholders' patience had worn thin and they refused to pump any more money into the beleaguered retailer. The British Property Federation said that landlords had been hit especially hard by JJB's collapse. Liz Peace, the federation's chief executive, said: \"Having played their part in twice saving JJB from administration, taking a financial hit in the process, landlords will be understandably frustrated and left wondering whether the pain was really worth it.\" She added: \"We can only hope that the timing of the administration isn't an attempt to avoid paying rent on the 20 units which have been sold.\" Rent owed to a landlord prior to the appointment of administrators is not treated as a cost of the administration. This has in the past led to tenants being put into administration just after quarter day \u2013 the last one was on Saturday \u2013 so they can use the premises for the remainder of the quarter without having to pay rent, she said. Christopher Sheldon, who was made redundant in 2009, said: \"Chris Ronnie ruined the reputation of the company in his short tenure of JJB. It never recovered from the mismanagement. It's a sad day but not a surprise.\" With Britain mired in a double-dip recession, JJB has followed other well-known retailers into administration, including outdoor retailer Blacks Leisure and discount fashion chain Peacocks last year.",

      "body": "<p>JJB Sports, once Britain's biggest sports retailer, finally collapsed into administration last night after weeks of negotiations failed to secure the future of 133 shops and 2,200 staff.</p> <p>The Wigan-based company, which was worth more than \u00a31bn in its heyday, called in administrators from KPMG on Monday after attempts to sell the business foundered, despite initial interest from more than 100 parties including the company's founder Dave Whelan.</p> <p>The administrators only managed to sell 20 JJB stores, the brand and the website to its arch-rival Sports Direct for \u00a324m, saving 550 jobs in the UK, including warehouse staff. The shops are expected to be rebranded as Sports Direct.</p> <p>Sports Direct, controlled by Newcastle United FC owner Mike Ashley, has also snapped up all of JJB's stock and the Slazenger Golf brand licences, as well as the company's headquarters in Wigan, a freehold property.</p> <p>However, the remaining 133 JJB stores shut on Monday leaving 2,200 people out of work. Some 167 employees have been retained to help the administrators but will lose their jobs once their work is done.</p> <p>The sale proceeds will be used to repay some of JJB's \u00a345m debt to its lender, Lloyds Banking Group and other secured creditors, US group Dick's Sporting Goods and Adidas. But shareholders will go empty-handed, while suppliers \u2013 Nike, Adidas and Umbro \u2013 and landlords will get very little, if anything. The shares were worth less than a penny when they were suspended.</p> <p>There had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/30/dave-whelan-jjb-sports\" title=\"\">hopes that Whelan, a former Blackburn Rovers footballer who is now chairman of Wigan Athletic, would step in to save the stricken company</a> that he founded in 1971 when he turned a Wigan fishing tackle shop, JJ Bradburns, into a sports store. In 1994, the 120-store chain floated on the London Stock Exchange and four years later, the acquisition of Sports Division, its largest competitor at the time, turned it into the largest sports retailer in the UK.</p> <p>Richard Fleming, UK head of restructuring at KPMG, said: \"Successive attempts to restructure the business, both financially and operationally, have not been enough to prevent the company falling into administration. Unfortunately a buyer could only be found for 20 stores on a going-concern basis.\"</p> <p>All staff made redundant have had their arrears of wages and holiday entitlements paid in full.</p> <p>David McCorquodale, corporate finance partner at KPMG who led the sales process, said he and his team had spoken to more than 100 parties in the first few days of their appointment and eight trade and private equity players went on to table first round bids. \"Unfortunately the level of cash and further operational restructuring required to rescue a more substantial part of the business was too much risk for most interested parties,\" he said. \"We hope to be able to sell the leasehold interests of some of the remaining stores, which may result in re-employment of some staff.\"</p> <p>JJB never recovered after a series of poor acquisitions saddled it with debt during chief executive Chris Ronnie's tenure between 2007 and 2009, although some believe its problems started much earlier. Analysts say JJB's management lacked the expertise to keep up with Sports Direct's aggressive expansion and strategy of acquiring brands such as Lonsdale and Dunlop, while JJB's clothing business was also hammered by competition from supermarkets and discount chains such as Primark.</p> <p>Two company voluntary arrangements in 2009 and 2011 \u2013 legal agreements designed to reduce rent costs for struggling retailers \u2013 shrank the store portfolio but failed to save the business. JJB put itself up for sale in August this year after warning it could run out of money. It had been kept afloat thanks to the support of a core group of investors \u2013 Invesco, Harris Associates, Crystal Amber and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 but by then shareholders' patience had worn thin and they refused to pump any more money into the beleaguered retailer.</p> <p>The British Property Federation said that landlords had been hit especially hard by JJB's collapse. Liz Peace, the federation's chief executive, said: \"Having played their part in twice saving JJB from administration, taking a financial hit in the process, landlords will be understandably frustrated and left wondering whether the pain was really worth it.\"</p> <p>She added: \"We can only hope that the timing of the administration isn't an attempt to avoid paying rent on the 20 units which have been sold.\" Rent owed to a landlord prior to the appointment of administrators is not treated as a cost of the administration. This has in the past led to tenants being put into administration just after quarter day \u2013 the last one was on Saturday \u2013 so they can use the premises for the remainder of the quarter without having to pay rent, she said.</p> <p>Christopher Sheldon, who was made redundant in 2009, said: \"Chris Ronnie ruined the reputation of the company in his short tenure of JJB. It never recovered from the mismanagement. It's a sad day but not a surprise.\"</p> <p>With Britain mired in a double-dip recession, JJB has followed other well-known retailers into administration, including outdoor retailer Blacks Leisure and discount fashion chain Peacocks last year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If in doubt, let the shareholders decide. It's rarely a bad principle and it's no surprise that Xstrata's board, after numerous cock-ups, has sought sanctuary in it. Xstrata investors can now vote to have their company combine with Glencore only if a \u00a3140m retention package for 70 executives is approved, which is what the board recommends. Or they can have the merger-cum-takeover without the lavish handouts. Or they can shoot down the deal altogether. Everybody happy? No. Giving shareholders more freedom to choose is clearly sensible. But investors also require useful information so that they can make a proper appraisal of risk and rewards. That's where the Xstrata chairman, Sir John Bond, and his colleagues have fallen short. Monday's document, like the last, is seriously deficient in two important areas. Look, for example, at the board's stance on option two \u2013 that of approving the deal but blocking the retention package. In effect, the directors are saying to the shareholders: \"On your heads be it.\" Their reasoning is that \"the value proposition of the combined entity\" would be \"at risk\" without the retention package. Come on, you can do better than that. Why do the retention sums have to be so large? What is the best estimate of how many executives would quit if deprived of their golden carrots? And why couldn't adequate replacements be found within Xstrata's own ranks? The 58-page document glosses over such detailed questions, expecting shareholders not to want to look further than the \"at risk\" line. Not good enough. There is also a gross lack of information over strategy. Anybody who has followed this saga over the past nine months knows that the two companies have different views on how to allocate capital in mining. The Glencore thesis is that the best returns come from extending so-called brownfield sites and that the political risk that goes with investing in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo is tolerable. The Xstrata approach, as evidenced in its heavy capital spending in recent years, prefers greenfield expansion, with a strong inclination towards \"safe\" countries. Is there real tension there, as opposed to the superficial squabbling that goes on during deal negotiations? If so, how will it be resolved? The short answer, it seems, is that fans of Xstrata's strategy are meant to be happy that their company will have a majority of one on the combined board, even if Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg will be chief executive after six months. But this governance arrangement will last two years. For investors who own Xstrata shares because they have a bullish 10-year view of the commodities cycle, two years is no time at all. They are being asked to accept Glencore paper with very little idea of how the new board, which is likely to come to be dominated by Glencore from the third year, will conduct investment. All in all, Iain Richards of Threadneedle has the clearest view of this unappetising transaction: \"The process through which this deal emerged and has been overseen has been deeply disappointing. The apparent target fixation on doing a deal has, to our minds, been at the expense of proper consideration being given to the quality and value embedded in Xstrata and its good prospects as a stand-alone business. The extraordinary executive payments envisaged by the board, firmly incentivising the deal, have done nothing but exacerbate that perception and the related concerns that exist.\" Yes, that's the measure of it. Of course, the deal is almost certain to happen because Qatar Holdings, with 12% of Xstrata, seems now to be in favour. But the creation of Glenstrata will surely come to be seen as a depressing low point in City dealmaking. Yes, life is tricky when you have a 34% shareholder \u2013 but not half as tricky as Xstrata's board has made it look.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The \u00a349bn mega-merger between commodities trader Glencore and mining group Xstrata has hit the rocks again, hours after the Anglo-Swiss miner gave its blessing to the deal. Two of Xstrata's large shareholders \u2013 Knight Vinke Asset Management and Threadneedle Investments \u2013 have attacked the company's board for agreeing to the deal, which they say gives away the miner's future profits \"on the cheap\" and gives bosses \"extraordinary executive payments\". \"It was with considerable disappointment that we read this morning's announcement that the proposed merger with Glencore is to be recommended,\" Iain Richards, head of governance and responsible investment at Threadneedle Investments, said in a letter to Xstrata's board. Richards' letter, which described the deal as \"deeply disappointing\" and making \"no sense\", was emailed to Xstrata hours after the company's board advised shareholders to vote in favour of a revised deal. \"The apparent target fixation on doing a deal has, to our minds, been at the expense of proper consideration being given to the quality and value embedded in Xstrata and its good prospects as a standalone business,\" Richards said. \"The extraordinary executive payments envisaged by the board, firmly incentivising the deal, have done nothing but exacerbate that perception and the related concerns that exist.\" Threadneedle owns 0.3% of the shares. Richards said no one should be in any doubt that the merger is actually an effective takeover, which is \"heavily weighted in favour of Glencore, which clearly needs this far more than Xstrata does\". He said the deal, which will end up \"giving away the expected future returns on the investment that has been made in Xstrata's business, on the cheap, makes no sense to us or for our clients\". Activist investor Knight Vinke, one of the 20 biggest holders of Xstrata stock, also attacked the deal. David Trenchard, vice chairman of Knight Vinke, accused Xstrata non-executive directors of failing to \"demonstrate sufficient independence and robustness throughout this process\". Trenchard said Knight Vinke would consult with other shareholders with a view to \"taking steps that will strengthen the independence of the Xstrata board\". Earlier on Monday Xstrata formally recommended that shareholders vote in favour of the deal, which has been delayed by battles over the price and \u00a3173m of proposed bonuses for Xstrata bosses. Xstrata said it had redrawn the deal to allow shareholders to vote in favour while revolting against the massive \"pay to stay\" bonuses to Xstrata directors. \"We have decided to decouple the resolutions to approve the merger from the resolution to approve the revised management incentive arrangements,\" Sir John Bond, Xstrata's chairman, said. \"This will, we believe, enable shareholders to vote in line with their convictions without influencing their vote on the deal to create one of the world's biggest mining companies.\" The new deal requires 75% of shareholders to support the merger, but only 50% need to vote in favour of the retention package, which has been reduced to \u00a3144m. Glencore, which is Xstrata's biggest shareholder with a 34% stake, cannot vote. Glencore, which was founded by Marc Rich, a commodities trader best known for being charged by US authorities with selling oil to Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, has also been forced to sweeten the offer in order to win the backing of Xstrata's shareholders. Last month the commodities trader increased its offer for Xstrata to 3.05 Glencore shares for each of the mining firm's, after Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, Xstrata's second-largest investor, threatened to block the deal. Glencore had previously offered 2.8 shares. The improved terms came after Tony Blair was drafted in to broker an 11th-hour deal, earning himself a reported $1m (\u00a3620,000) for three hours of late negotiations in Claridge's hotel in London. Xstrata confirmed that its chief executive, Mick Davis, will leave the combined group, which will be led by his Glencore counterpart, Ivan Glasenberg. Davis will leave after six months and will not collected \u00a329m of previously planned retention bonuses. However, he is expected to collect about \u00a336m in cash and from the vesting of previously awarded share scheme bonuses. Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie, said: \"The new vote structure is unique to say the least and we'll see if perhaps from a corporate governance point of view this ruffles a few feathers. \"I think overall the new merger ratio and this new structure's probably enough to get it done.\" Paul Gait, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said: \"It's risky to split the vote, but it's a calculated gamble. If the now separate measures pass, Glencore is free from the taint of railroading through a compensation package against shareholder wishes.\" The merger, which has been on the cards for years, would create a \u00a349bn company with about 130,000 employees in more than 40 countries. It would bring together Xstrata's coal, copper, nickel and zinc mines with Glencore's virtually unchallengeable position trading hundreds of commodities, including oil, coal, metals and grains. Earlier this year Glencore hit the headlines when the head of its food business said the worst drought to hit the US since the 1930s would be \"good for Glencore\" because it will lead to opportunities to exploit soaring prices. The Anglo-Swiss company has also made more than \u00a350m from the sale of wheat to the World Food Programme.",

      "body": "<p>The \u00a349bn mega-merger between commodities trader Glencore and mining group Xstrata has hit the rocks again, hours after the Anglo-Swiss miner gave its blessing to the deal.</p> <p>Two of Xstrata's large shareholders \u2013 Knight Vinke Asset Management and Threadneedle Investments \u2013 have attacked the company's board for agreeing to the deal, which they say gives away the miner's future profits \"on the cheap\" and gives bosses \"extraordinary executive payments\".</p> <p>\"It was with considerable disappointment that we read this morning's announcement that the proposed merger with Glencore is to be recommended,\" Iain Richards, head of governance and responsible investment at Threadneedle Investments, said in a letter to Xstrata's board.</p> <p>Richards' letter, which described the deal as \"deeply disappointing\" and making \"no sense\", was emailed to Xstrata hours after the company's board advised shareholders to vote in favour of a revised deal.</p> <p>\"The apparent target fixation on doing a deal has, to our minds, been at the expense of proper consideration being given to the quality and value embedded in Xstrata and its good prospects as a standalone business,\" Richards said. \"The extraordinary executive payments envisaged by the board, firmly incentivising the deal, have done nothing but exacerbate that perception and the related concerns that exist.\" Threadneedle owns 0.3% of the shares.</p> <p>Richards said no one should be in any doubt that the merger is actually an effective takeover, which is \"heavily weighted in favour of Glencore, which clearly needs this far more than Xstrata does\".</p> <p>He said the deal, which will end up \"giving away the expected future returns on the investment that has been made in Xstrata's business, on the cheap, makes no sense to us or for our clients\".</p> <p>Activist investor Knight Vinke, one of the 20 biggest holders of Xstrata stock, also attacked the deal. David Trenchard, vice chairman of Knight Vinke, accused Xstrata non-executive directors of failing to \"demonstrate sufficient independence and robustness throughout this process\".</p> <p>Trenchard said Knight Vinke would consult with other shareholders with a view to \"taking steps that will strengthen the independence of the Xstrata board\".</p> <p>Earlier on Monday Xstrata formally recommended that shareholders vote in favour of the deal, which has been delayed by battles over the price and \u00a3173m of proposed bonuses for Xstrata bosses.</p> <p>Xstrata said it had redrawn the deal to allow shareholders to vote in favour while revolting against the massive \"pay to stay\" bonuses to Xstrata directors.</p> <p>\"We have decided to decouple the resolutions to approve the merger from the resolution to approve the revised management incentive arrangements,\" <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201210010700105493N\" title=\"\">Sir John Bond, Xstrata's chairman, said</a>. \"This will, we believe, enable shareholders to vote in line with their convictions without influencing their vote on the deal to create one of the world's biggest mining companies.\"</p> <p>The new deal requires 75% of shareholders to support the merger, but only 50% need to vote in favour of the retention package, which has been reduced to \u00a3144m. Glencore, which is Xstrata's biggest shareholder with a 34% stake, cannot vote.</p> <p>Glencore, which was founded by Marc Rich, a commodities trader best known for being charged by US authorities with selling oil to Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, has also been forced to sweeten the offer in order to win the backing of Xstrata's shareholders.</p> <p>Last month the commodities trader increased its offer for Xstrata to 3.05 Glencore shares for each of the mining firm's, after Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, Xstrata's second-largest investor, threatened to block the deal. Glencore had previously offered 2.8 shares.</p> <p>The improved terms came after Tony Blair was drafted in to broker an 11th-hour deal, earning himself a reported $1m (\u00a3620,000) for three hours of late negotiations in Claridge's hotel in London.</p> <p>Xstrata confirmed that its chief executive, Mick Davis, will leave the combined group, which will be led by his Glencore counterpart, Ivan Glasenberg.</p> <p>Davis will leave after six months and will not collected \u00a329m of previously planned retention bonuses. However, he is expected to collect about \u00a336m in cash and from the vesting of previously awarded share scheme bonuses.</p> <p>Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie, said: \"The new vote structure is unique to say the least and we'll see if perhaps from a corporate governance point of view this ruffles a few feathers.</p> <p>\"I think overall the new merger ratio and this new structure's probably enough to get it done.\"</p> <p>Paul Gait, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said: \"It's risky to split the vote, but it's a calculated gamble. If the now separate measures pass, Glencore is free from the taint of railroading through a compensation package against shareholder wishes.\"</p> <p>The merger, which has been on the cards for years, would create a \u00a349bn company with about 130,000 employees in more than 40 countries.</p> <p>It would bring together Xstrata's coal, copper, nickel and zinc mines with Glencore's virtually unchallengeable position trading hundreds of commodities, including oil, coal, metals and grains.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/21/glencore-us-drought-good-for-business\" title=\"\">Earlier this year Glencore hit the headlines when the head of its food business said the worst drought to hit the US since the 1930s would be \"good for Glencore\" because it will lead to opportunities to exploit soaring prices.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/06/un-food-aid-glencore-xstrata\" title=\"\">The Anglo-Swiss company has also made more than \u00a350m from the sale of wheat to the World Food Programme. </a></p>",

The company had repurchased \u00a31.4bn in shares this year, but had been expected to spend \u00a32.8bn before Soriot put a stop to the practice.

His decision comes on the day he takes over from former chief executive David Brennan, who stepped down after setbacks in drug research and under pressure from shareholders. Brennan's focus in the last five years had been on paying dividends and buying back shares in the hope of creating higher returns for investors. In the past shareholders have complained when companies opt to buyback shares, claiming it leaves the price artificially high, although the shareprice reaction appears fairly muted. Brennan was arguably burnt by AstraZenca's purchase of MedImmune in 2007 for $15.2bn at the height of the boom and subsequently criticised for being too high. The change of direction by Soriot could lead to a resumption of major acquisitions by the firm, although this won't be known until the end of an annual review due to be revealed in January.

      "bodyText": "UK manufacturing activity dropped again in September, fuelling fears that the economy is deteriorating after a brief rebound. The news will reinforce the belief that the Bank of England will be forced extend its quantitative easing (QE) programme beyond its \u00a3375bn limit once the current round of asset purchases is complete in November. The UK data came amid a series of dismal manufacturing surveys from around the world.
