      "bodyText": "A financial trader who played the world\u2019s futures markets from a small suburban house in Hounslow, west London, has been arrested and faces extradition to the US after supposedly making $40m (\u00a327m) for his alleged role in the so-called \u201cflash crash\u201d of 2010. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) said on Tuesday that it was seeking the extradition of Navinder Singh Sarao, 37, who it claims \u201cspoofed\u201d financial markets using commercially available trading software to place $200m of false trades from his home in Hounslow. The US agency added that Sarao\u2019s supposed manipulation contributed to the flash crash on 6 May 2010, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 600 points in five minutes and created havoc on Wall Street. Sarao is expected to appear in custody at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday. He is accused of duping the market into believing there were a lot more sellers than there really were and profiting from the market movement. He is said to have changed his orders more than 19,000 times before cancelling them. The episode, although not attributed to him, formed the backdrop for the Robert Harris novel The Fear Index. A DoJ spokesman would not speculate on how one person, using widely available commercial software, might have been able to crash the world\u2019s financial markets. Nor would he comment on how an individual, who appears to live in a street populated by unremarkable three-bedroom semi-detached houses, seemed to make such huge rewards from his alleged scheme. However, the US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said Sarao and his company had profited by more than $40m. The DoJ detailed a series of supposed coups, including episodes where Sarao is said to have made profits of more than $820,000 during a day\u2019s trading. In an affidavit published by the DoJ in support of its complaint, FBI special agent Gregory LaBerta said Sarao was \u201ca futures trader who operated from his residence in the United Kingdom and who primarily traded through his company, Nav Sarao Futures Limited. \u201cOn numerous occasions between at least in or about April 2010 and in or about April 2014, Sarao spoofed the market and manipulated the intra-day price for \u2026 S&amp;P 500 futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, including on or about 6 May 2010, when the US stock markets plunged dramatically in a matter of minutes in an event that came to be known as the \u2018Flash Crash\u2019.\u201d The DoJ added: \u201cBy allegedly placing multiple, simultaneous, large-volume sell orders at different price points \u2013 a technique known as \u2018layering\u2019 \u2013 Sarao created the appearance of substantial supply in the market \u2026 When prices fell as a result of this activity, Sarao allegedly sold futures contracts only to buy them back at a lower price.\u201d The agency said Sarao had been charged in a federal criminal complaint in the northern district of Illinois with one count of wire fraud, 10 counts of commodities fraud, 10 counts of commodities manipulation and one count of spoofing, a practice of bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution. Sarao could not be contacted by the Guardian on Tuesday, and there was no answer at the house where he is understood to live with his parents. Neighbours said the family have lived in the quiet suburban street in Hounslow for many years. Residents in the street said they saw around 20 people going in and out of the house on Tuesday morning, and an unmarked police car parked outside. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: \u201cI was taking my son to school this morning at around 8.15am and then I saw around 10 people in their front garden. I saw the mother who lives there walk over from her other son\u2019s house, who lives across the road. She didn\u2019t look very happy. And I saw an unmarked police car with plainclothed officers inside. The family keep themselves to themselves.\u201d Another neighbour, who also asked not to be named, said: \u201cA neighbour told me they saw around 20 people coming in and out of the house, and police cars.\u201d The affidavit released by DoJ officials detailed some of the replies Sarao is said to have given to regulators when contacted about his trades. In 2014, he explained his successes to the Financial Conduct Authority by saying \u201che had always been good with reflexes and doing things quick\u201d. He also apologised to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and his broker in March 2010 after placing a large number of cancelled orders, which he said occurred after he had been demonstrating to a friend what was done \u201cby the high-frequency [trading] geeks\u201d. In another response to an effort to contact him in May 2010, Sarao is said to have emailed his broker to say that he had \u201cjust called\u201d the Chicago exchange \u201cand told \u2019em to kiss my ass\u201d. The flash crash happened at 2.45pm on 6 May 2010 \u2013 the date of the last general election. Wall Street was concerned about the looming debt crisis in Greece and the Dow Jones index was already down by about 300 points, only for markets to fall further \u2013 about 600 points in five minutes. It was the biggest intra-day decline in Wall Street history, although most of the loss was regained within 20 minutes. There were several theories about its cause, from a single fat-finger trade, to the machinations of high-frequency traders and a computer glitch.",

      "bodyText": "Andy Haste, the man trying to find a viable business at Wonga in the new era of proper regulation of payday lending, was half right. On joining as chairman last July he said Wonga would be smaller and less profitable in the short term. It is definitely smaller: revenues fell by a third last year. As for less profitable, well, it didn\u2019t actually make profits. There was a thumping \u00a340m loss instead. The bullish case for Wonga says there will always be demand for short-term credit. In theory, a cleaned-up market leader, shouting its conversion to responsible lending, should be able to make sustainable returns even under a regulator-imposed cap on interest rates. In practice, life may be more complicated. Wonga isn\u2019t starting with a clean sheet. It is obliged to invest heavily in better software and has to cover the cost of laying off half its staff. Its brand name may also be toxic. Haste seems uncertain on that point. He is sticking with Wonga for payday lending (for now, at least) but new financial products may be launched under a different banner. That would be probably be wise. If the Haste plan works, payday lending will contribute less than half the group\u2019s revenues in five years\u2019 time. The new products, aimed at credit-impaired punters, have yet to be unveiled. But if there\u2019s any risk of infection from the Wonga brand, best to try a fresh label. Haste, former boss of insurer RSA, starts the task of resuscitation with \u00a3125m of cash in the bank, so his diversification strategy will have a chance to work. But note the caution: \u201cWe know it will take time to repair our reputation and gain an accepted place in the financial services industry,\u201d he says. That seems 100% correct. Sky looks comfortable on the ball Sky\u2019s share price has risen 20% since the broadcaster \u201coverpaid\u201d for its next set of Premier League rights. Five plum packages cost the equivalent of \u00a311m a game; a staggering sum. But the share price reaction offers a simple lesson. Sky\u2019s shareholders really didn\u2019t fancy living without top-flight football. Bidding high \u2013 about \u00a31bn more than the City expected over the course of three seasons \u2013 was logical. Or, rather, it was the lesser of two risks. The higher costs still have to be met, of course, which is why Tuesday\u2019s third-quarter figures carried added significance. Any hint that customers will rebel against planned price increases might have prompted a rethink about Sky\u2019s football addiction. In the event, the churn statistic \u2013 which measures the percentage of customers cancelling subscriptions \u2013 was the best for 11 years, as was the number of arriving customers. Chief executive Jeremy Darroch served up superlatives after a 20% jump in operating profits and Sky\u2019s shares hit their highest level since the turn of the century. Game over? Not quite. First, the price rises \u2013 \u00a32.50-\u00a33 a month on average \u2013 haven\u2019t happened yet; customers have merely been informed of the increases. Second, BT has opened a new competitive front by buying EE, obliging Sky to enter into the mobile market via a piggy-back wholesaling deal with O2. Third, Sky has made its biggest commercial bet in years by unifying the European empire with the purchases of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland. It will be two years \u2013 at the earliest \u2013 before the success of those deals can be judged. Investors are right to be confident that Sky can handle a bigger and more complicated operation. The company never shoots itself in the foot and, by now, Darroch should have a keen sense of the prices UK customers will tolerate. All the same, the shares now trade on 17 times next year\u2019s earnings, on house broker Barclays\u2019 forecasts. That looks punchy, even with a 3% dividend yield. One football auction has been safely negotiated. But the football beast will always need feeding again. Don\u2019t fear coalition Why aren\u2019t financial markets, little more than a fortnight ahead of a too-close-to-call general election, terrified? Did nobody listen to the great sage, WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell, when he said the choice was between a Tory-led government that would produce \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d on Europe and a Labour-led administration with a \u201cbashing business\u201d manifesto? Citigroup\u2019s Tina Fordham has the explanation. There is probably less to fear from a minority government than in past. Labour policies would hit specific sectors but the differences in fiscal policy are \u201cminimal\u201d. In short: \u201cMarkets look likely to view divided government like Wall Street: gridlock is good.\u201d That\u2019s a reasonable real-world assessment.",

Pork Farms looks likely to get the final go-ahead to take a bigger slice of the UK\u2019s \u00a31bn chilled savoury pastry market after the interim report on its acquisition of the chilled savoury pastries division of Kerry Foods. As both supply supermarkets with own-label snacks, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been chewing over the meaty merger since the start of the year for fear it could push up the prices of pies, pasties and slices. However, the watchdog\u2019s four cold savoury pastry investigators provisionally concluded on Tuesday that the merged bakers did not make all the pies and there were enough other suppliers to keep prices down. The merger was not expected to substantially cut competition, the CMA said. John Wotton, the chair of CMA\u2019s group investigating the merger, said: \u201cWe have provisionally concluded that the merger will not give the parties an opportunity to raise prices or reduce quality. The evidence we heard indicated that the merger would not significantly affect customers\u2019 ability to negotiate for the best deal for these products.\u201d He suggested other players in the pork pie market were agile enough to fill any supply gaps. \u201cIf necessary, customers such as retailers and wholesalers could switch to available alternative suppliers and we found that there was sufficient capacity, either currently available or which could be quickly brought into play, to allow customers to switch suppliers.\u201d Pork Farms, which makes its own branded pies as well as snacks for retailers such as Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s, said it was waiting for the final competition ruling to be served. A decision is due by 21 June. Chris Peters, the managing director of Pork Farms, said: \u201cWe are very pleased with the CMA\u2019s provisional conclusion that the merger has not resulted, and may not be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition. \u201cHowever, we are aware these findings are currently provisional and that we are still subject to the interim order, which requires us to continue to hold the acquired businesses separate.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Greece 'running out of money' as hopes of imminent deal to end debt crisis fade", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers has said Greece is running out of money as hopes of a deal to end the country\u2019s worsening debt crisis by the end of this week have again been dashed. Sources in Brussels said there was no prospect of concluding negotiations between the Syriza-led coalition in Athens and its creditors by the time the 18 finance ministers meet in Riga at the end of this week. On a fresh day of turmoil, Greek shares and bonds came under heavy selling pressure and local authorities reacted furiously to the sequestering of their spare funds by the central bank in order to pay the day-to-day bills of the central government. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and leader of the Eurogroup, said he still expected a deal to be struck in the coming weeks and that it was in the interests of the eurozone for Greece to remain in the currency bloc. Brussels wants Greece to agree to stick broadly to deeply unpopular economic policies in return for receiving fresh financial support worth more than \u20ac7bn, which would allow it to avoid defaulting on debt repayments. Talks with Athens, however, have proved difficult. If Greece leaves the eurozone \u201cyou get very dangerous instability,\u201d Dijsselbloem told the broadcaster RTL. \u201cIt\u2019s in the interests of Greece and the eurozone as a whole to avoid that.\u201d \u201cThe money is starting to run out,\u201d he added. Financial markets were rattled by reports that the European Central Bank was losing patience with Athens and preparing to limit the help it has been providing to keep Greek banks afloat. Interest rates on five-year Greek bonds, seen as a benchmark of investor confidence, rose to record highs and are at levels that signal expectations of a debt default or writedown. The Greek stock market closed more than 3% down, at its lowest level since 2012. Eirini Tsekeridou, a fixed income analyst at Julius Baer, said: \u201cWe still believe that in the end, the Greek government will agree to the terms of the creditors regarding taxes, pensions, privatisations etc in order for the next tranche of \u20ac7.2bn to be released. \u201cAlthough we regard a Greek exit from the eurozone as unlikely and with limited contagion risk towards the rest of the eurozone, we avoid holding Greek debt at this juncture due to the high political instability.\u201d Mayors attending an emergency meeting of the Central Union of Greek Municipalities (KEDE) hurled abuse at the deputy finance minister, Dimitris Mardas, when he announced that the \u201cinternal loan\u201d to the central bank would be enforced for at least two months. \u201cIs this your democracy?\u201d protesters shouted.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Primark has posted an 11% rise in first-half profits as the discount chain gears up for expansion into the US, but warned about rising costs due to the stronger dollar. George Weston, the chief executive of Primark\u2019s owner, Associated British Foods, said plans for the retailer\u2019s foray into the north-east US were \u201cwell advanced\u201d. Last autumn, it struck a surprise deal to to take over unwanted shop space in American malls from the US retailer Sears. The first outlet is expected to open in Boston this autumn and a second in Philadelphia before Christmas. David Alexander, analyst at retail researcher Conlumino, applauded Primark\u2019s strategy of focusing on \u201cone corner of the USA, eschewing prime locations like Manhattan, to ensure that it meets consumer expectations in the States head-on before rolling out nationwide\u201d. Rapid international expansion boosted total sales at Primark, which has 287 stores, by 15% to \u00a32.5bn at a constant exchange rate (12% at the actual rate) in the six months to 28 February. Operating profits powered 11% ahead to \u00a3322m at constant exchange rates (8% at actual rates). However, on a like-for-like basis sales were flat in the first half. The retailer blamed the unseasonably warm weather across northern Europe last autumn, along with the impact that new stores in the Netherlands and Germany had on existing shops. Weston said Primark had doubled the number of stores in the Netherlands and increased its German outlets from 11 to 16. He said that like-for-like sales in the UK were up 3% as the chain had bounced back over Christmas from a warm autumn and that customers were responding well to spring fashions including bohemian dresses, bracelets and hats. \u201cThere are a lot of discounts on the high street and that\u2019s not just the end of autumn winter, that\u2019s new season, so it\u2019s clearly been tough. Last year was unusually good as it was very warm very early and it got everyone into the habit of buying spring summer. This year is not bad but the warm weather has come later,\u201d he said. Alexander talked of \u201canother barnstorming performance from wallet-friendly, fast-fashion kingpin Primark\u201d. He said: \u201cThe group\u2019s like-for-like performance naturally excludes trading from stores opened over the past 12 months, which includes its entire French operation, as well as stores in Berlin, Stuttgart and Cologne, all of which, Primark claims, feature in its top 20 performers on an annualised sales basis. \u201cThe retailer has defied the naysayers to become a firm favourite across its burgeoning European empire. Such has been the alacrity with which Spanish, French, Dutch and German consumers have taken to Primark that it has become a real disruptor on the fashion scene right across its territories.\u201d Spain, Portugal and Ireland performed very strongly. Primark plans to open more stores \u2013 or extensions to existing shops \u2013 in Germany, Belgium and the UK in the coming months. Total new selling space this year will be under 1m sq ft, compared with 1.5m sq ft planned for the next financial year. Like other retailers such as H&amp;M, Primark has been hit by the strengthening US currency because it buys many of its garments in dollars but sells them in euros and sterling. The continued impact of the stronger dollar will drive up costs for the autumn-winter season. The group indicated it would not pass on these costs to customers, which means profit margins could be hurt. Weston warned: \u201cIf the current euro weakness against sterling and the US dollar persists, this will have an impact on the group\u2019s operating profit for the remainder of this financial year and a greater impact next year.\u201d Jon Copestake, chief retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cPrimark are doing great and delivering consistent growth while ABF continues to struggle with sugar prices. Consumers are polarised between bargain prices for basic clothes and trading up for more showy clothes \u2013 this may change, and Primark\u2019s foray into markets like the USA adds an element of future risk.\u201d At Primark\u2019s owner, ABF, profits before tax halved to \u00a3213m. Higher profits at the discount retailer partly offset a sharp drop in profits at the group\u2019s sugar division due to much weaker EU sugar prices.",

      "bodyText": "From the 1960s to the 1990s, children across the western world were raised on a kaleidoscopic diet. The rainbow assortment of Lucky Charms for breakfast. The varying hues of Pop Tarts by mid-morning. The lurid yellow of mac and cheese for lunch. A bag of Cheetos (orange) with a Kool-Aid (red) mid-afternoon, before an evening meal of yet more mac and cheese. For years, the proud heritage of the chemically raised child has been under threat. And now the final nail has been slammed into the vividly coloured coffin with this week\u2019s announcement that the Kraft Foods conglomerate will stop pumping its mac and cheese full of synthetic colours and preservatives. From January 2016 and every generation thereon, \u201cOriginal Kraft Macaroni and Cheese\u201d sold in the US will be made from natural sources from the US, ending years of pig-headed, fingers-in-ears resistance from one of the world\u2019s largest food companies. Yellow 5 and yellow 6 dyes are the most egregious contents of Kraft\u2019s mac and cheese, said by some to increase hyperactivity in children. Although allowed by the FDA, yellow 5 is banned in Norway and Austria and yellow 6 banned in Norway and Finland. Kraft\u2019s UK version of mac and cheese \u2013 Cheesey Pasta \u2013 famously contains neither. It\u2019s better for parents and children that mac and cheese will not contain stuff that might harm them. But with activists, including the Environmental Working Group, claiming that Kraft\u2019s move should be \u201ca wake-up call\u201d for other food manufacturers, it is difficult not to feel openly nostalgic for the glory days of brightly coloured, pumped-full-of-chemicals foodstuffs. Blue Smarties were dropped in 2005, only to return in 2008 as a distinctly less blue. M&amp;Ms have come under attack for their use of red, yellow and blue artificial dyes. Green Ketchup was a revelation for Heinz when it was introduced in 2000. At its launch, then-global ketchup manager Casey Kelley said the company was \u201con track to ship in the first 90 days what we thought we would sell in the first year\u201d. \u201cThis thing has taken on a momentum of its own,\u201d Kelley said, illustrating with his use of the term \u201cthis thing\u201d the sinister fascination with a new, inappropriately coloured sauce. Soon there was orange ketchup, and purple ketchup, and teal and blue and pink. But it didn\u2019t last. Heinz withdrew those product lines in 2006, and the world was left with plain-old red ketchup. It might well have been the last hurrah of for a generation\u2019s rainbow of nonsense food. We might be healthier for it. But we are less colourful, too. So, next time you stroll down the bland cereal or snack aisle, spare a thought for the proud chemical factories, where scientists in white coats once injected a vast palette of colours into everyday foods. Imagine what we could have been eating by now. Rainbow bread. Yellow steak. Pink cheese. Imagine now a grey factory. A decaying factory. Windows long since smashed, roof in disrepair. A laboratory full of test tubes and conical flasks lying on their sides. A solitary Cheeto, proudly orange, blown past in an icy wind. A flash of colour among the dreary scene, it briefly lifts the spirits before getting caught up in the dust, doomed to fade and fester. Imagine this, and lament.",

But it didn\u2019t last. Heinz withdrew those product lines in 2006, and the world was left with plain-old red ketchup. It might well have been the last hurrah of for a generation\u2019s rainbow of nonsense food.</p> <p>We might be healthier for it. But we are less colourful, too. So, next time you stroll down the bland cereal or snack aisle, spare a thought for the proud chemical factories, where scientists in white coats once injected a vast palette of colours into everyday foods.</p> <p>Imagine what we could have been eating by now. Rainbow bread. Yellow steak. Pink cheese.</p> <p>Imagine now a grey factory. A decaying factory. Windows long since smashed, roof in disrepair. A laboratory full of test tubes and conical flasks lying on their sides. A solitary Cheeto, proudly orange, blown past in an icy wind. A flash of colour among the dreary scene, it briefly lifts the spirits before getting caught up in the dust, doomed to fade and fester.</p> <p>Imagine this, and lament.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wonga, Britain\u2019s biggest payday lender, has slumped deep into the red following a series of scandals that saw it branded \u201cmorally wrong\u201d by the Church of England. The controversial firm is considering changing its name under an overhaul masterminded by the executive chairman, Andy Haste, who was brought in last July to clean up its act and immediately hired a new management team. He warned that 2015 will be just as tough, with more losses to come. He said: \u201cWe know it will take time to repair our reputation and gain an accepted place in the financial services industry, but we\u2019re determined to deliver on our plans and serve our customers in the right way.\u201d Wonga, founded by Errol Damelin in 2006, became the focus of opposition to the payday loan industry, with the firm\u2019s profits of \u00a31m-plus a week condemned as \u201cvulture capitalism\u201d by Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union. The archbishop of Canterbury accused the firm of destroying lives, and pledged to boost credit unions as an alternative to payday lenders. Wonga lurched from scandal to scandal. In June 2014, it was ordered to pay more than \u00a32.6m compensation to customers by the Financial Conduct Authority after it was found to have sent threatening letters to customers from fake law firms. In October, Wonga was forced by the City watchdog to write off \u00a3220m of loans to 375,000 customers, who it admitted should never have been given loans. Accused by MPs of \u201clegal loan sharking\u201d, Wonga charged annualised interest rates of up to 5,853% and some of the loans ballooned from a few hundred to thousands of pounds. The firm\u2019s conduct prompted the watchdog to clamp down on payday lending practices. It capped the amount of interest firms can charge so people taking out payday loans will never have to repay more than twice the sum they borrowed. The annualised interest rate is now capped at 1,500% \u2013 which means customers pay \u00a324 interest for \u00a3100 borrowed. The average loan is \u201ca few hundred pounds\u201d and is typically taken out for two weeks, Haste said. Stella Creasy, the Labour and Co-operative candidate for Walthamstow who has led the campaign against payday lenders, tweeted: \u201cSo Wonga are finding predatory lending doesn\u2019t pay \u2013 lets now make sure that\u2019s the case for credit cards \u2026 *lock and load* #sharkstoppers.\u201d She said she wants to take the fight to \u201cpredatory credit card lending\u201d, arguing that credit card companies use similar practices of extending loans and raising rates and keeping customers imprisoned in deals. Mike O\u2019Connor, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: \u201cThe crackdown on the payday loan market is having an effect but we still need to address the fact that many people need financial help. Payday loans can make people\u2019s problems worse and we need alternative ways of meeting the need for credit. More loans are not always the answer ... We must to do more to help people on low incomes to save for a rainy day so that they are less likely to need to borrow in emergencies.\u201d Wonga\u2019s results show it dived into a pretax loss of \u00a337.3m last year, against a profit of \u00a339.7m in 2013. Revenues fell 31% to \u00a3217.2m, as lending to UK consumers declined 36% to \u00a3732m, from \u00a31.1bn in 2013. The firm lost 400,000 UK customers and now has just under 600,000 borrowers. Martin Lewis, founder of Moneysavingexpert.com, tweeted: \u201cWonga announces losses of \u00a337m. So sorry to hear that! Happy to lend you some cash if you need it. Shall we say 5,000%?\u201d Wonga made 2.5m loans in the UK last year compared with 3.7m in 2013. The firm expects a further reduction in UK volumes in 2015, the first full year in which it is operating under its tightened affordability criteria. Previously, its checks were so poor that loans were granted to people who had no chance of ever repaying them, with many living on unemployment or disability benefits. Tara Kneafsey, the head of Wonga\u2019s UK business who joined from the insurer RSA, said: \u201cWe are focusing more on loan-to-income ratios and on people who are able to pay us back.\u201d Haste said the future of the Wonga brand was under review \u2013 \u201call of that stuff is in the melting pot. We are not ruling it out or in\u201d. He added: \u201cThe question comes down to whether it remains the only brand or one of many brands and ultimately does it stay as a brand for the overall company?\u201d There is no rush to change the name, he said, as the firm does not want to be accused of \u201cbrand washing\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important that we generate real change,\u201d he stressed. Wonga hopes to win new customers when it restarts advertising in the UK later this year after suspending it last summer \u2013 and the ads will not feature cuddly grandparent puppets again. A TV ad made by the company was banned last April and branded \u201cmisleading\u201d by the advertising watchdog. In the ad, one of two puppets discussing a Wonga loan suggested that the interest rate of 5,853% was \u201cirrelevant\u201d. The firm cancelled its UK TV ad campaign in July because, it said, it appealed to children, but continued to show similar TV ads in Poland and Spain for a few more months. Haste blamed previous commitments. The company, which sponsors Newcastle United football club, has agreed to remove the Wonga logo from all children\u2019s replica shirts from the 2016-17 season. Its chief financial officer, Paul Miles, said there will not be any further write-offs of customer loans, beyond last year\u2019s \u00a335m bill. As part of the changes, the payday lender is slashing a third of its workforce, 325 jobs, mainly in the UK and Ireland. The move was announced on the same day the Competition and Markets Authority set out new rules to force payday lenders to be clearer about their charges. Wonga is looking to launch new products this year and may need to raise debt next year to keep funding the business. While the UK payday loan market is 2.5-3 million people, Kneafsey said the firm has identified a bigger market of 13 million people who do not have access to mainstream banking. The company\u2019s UK main default rate has improved to 6.6% from 6.9% as fewer people fall into arrears. Haste said before the changes, 15% of customers were unable to repay their loan on the first day; that figure has now halved. Based in London, Wonga also provides short-term loans to consumers in South Africa, Poland, Spain and Canada. The UK slowdown has been partially offset by growth in Wonga\u2019s international businesses, including BillPay, which provides payment services to retailers and consumers in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Overall, the group had 3.7 million customers at the end of 2014. Haste said he joined Wonga because he believes \u201cthere is a real need and demand for short-term credit\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is clear to me that there is an important role in society for such credit providers, but only if they put their customers first and lend responsibly. Regrettably, that has not always been the case at Wonga. The new management team is tackling deep-rooted issues.\u201d \u2022 This article has been amended. An earlier report said that Wonga had lost 1m customers. In fact it had 1m borrowers but now has 600,000.",

      "bodyText": "With the impasse between Greece and its creditors showing no signs of ending, ahead of yet more European meetings, investors were reluctant to take too many changes, writes Nick Fletcher, despite some positive company results which gave some support. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 10.80 points or 0.15% at 7062.93 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.4% to 11,939.58 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.1% at 5192.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.4% to 23,240.26 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.33% at 11,422.3 The Athens market fell 3.33% to 704.74 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 69 points or 0.39%. On that note, we\u2019ll call it a day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Here\u2019s more the talks between Greek premier Alexis Tsipras and the head of Gazprom Alexei Miller from our correspondent Helena Smith in Athens: Although the Russian\u2019s visit has been decidedly silent on the news front \u2013 with neither Miller nor any of his interlocutors today making statements \u2013 well-placed aides are saying both sides are confident some sort of agreement will be signed imminently. A working group is to be established with the aim of setting up a \u201croad map\u201d of benchmarks that Moscow and Athens will commit to in the coming months. Investment in the Greek part of the pipeline \u2013 that will run from Russia\u2019s Black Sea coast through Turkey to Greece and into Europe via the Republic of Macedonia \u2013 is estimated at \u20ac2bn with Greece reaping the rewards of thousands of jobs and enhanced geopolitical stature, insiders said. Meanwhile, the Greek government\u2019s decision to bolster state coffers with the sequestered funds of local municipalities has been described as a coup d\u2019etat - not by the political opposition but a Syriza MP \u2013 highlighting just how incendiary the move has been. \u201cIt is tantamount to a coup d\u2019etat that does not suit our character and leftwing conscience,\u201d Yannis Micheloyiannakos, a Syriza deputy from Crete railed this afternoon. \u201cNothing can justify the government\u2019s action.\u201d Greece may have bought six week\u2019s grace if it succeeds in annexing local government funds, Bloomberg says: Greek officials expect an order that local governments transfer funds to the central bank will keep the country afloat until the end of May as European policy makers turn up the heat on Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Municipalities\u2019 reserves are estimated at about \u20ac1.5bn, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Officials in Athens ruled out also seizing pension funds and the cash reserves of state companies because there wasn\u2019t a need and the move would unnecessarily fuel anxiety, the person said. With bailout talks stalled, access to cash is becoming increasingly critical. Resistance at the European Central Bank to further aiding the country\u2019s stricken lenders is growing and the ECB is studying measures to rein in emergency funding for Greek banks, people with knowledge of the discussions said. Full story: Greece buys six week\u2019s space with transfer of city funds Some snaps coming out from Reuters on the talks between Athens and Russia\u2019s Gazprom: 21-Apr-2015 16:31 - GREEK ENERGY MINISTER SAYS ATHENS HELD \u201cCONSTRUCTIVE\u201d TALKS WITH GAZPROM CEO MILLER 21-Apr-2015 16:31 - GREEK ENERGY MINISTER SAYS HOPES WE WILL REACH DEAL ON RUSSIAN GAS PIPELINE SOON 21-Apr-2015 16:32 - GREEK ENERGY MINISTER SAYS BELIEVES EUROPEAN UNION WILL SUPPORT RUSSIAN GAS PIPELINE With deadlines for Greece coming and going, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that even eurozone officials are tired of setting a timeframe for the country to sort out its finances. Of course, the money is going to run out at some point but as has become pretty clear today, any idea of a deal at Friday\u2019s meeting seems fanciful. And Reuters is now reporting: Eurozone finance ministers will not set any deadline for Greece to come up with reforms to get more funding because such time limits lead to brinkmanship in negotiations, a senior euro zone official said on Tuesday. Greece, which is quickly running out of cash, pledged to its eurozone partners in February that by the end of April it would agree with creditors on a comprehensive list of reforms to get \u20ac7.2bn remaining from its bailout. Eurozone officials had expected the list to be presented to eurozone finance ministers this Friday in Riga. This would allow for a faster disbursement of cash to Athens, helping the debt-laden country avoid default on loan repayments on May 12. But no package will be ready by then and it is also unlikely it will be ready by the end of the month. This is mainly because in the past weeks Greece has not been providing the creditors with the financial data they seek or saying clearly what reforms it plans. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a European Union summit on migration on Thursday and the two are expected to discuss the funding crisis. Speaking in Vienna, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker urged Greece to step up efforts to strike a deal with its, warning that talks were not advanced enough to find a quick solution. A senior euro zone official involved in the talks said there had been some improvement in negotiations very recently, but not enough for a deal. \u201cThere is a clear pick up in activity, there is a clear pick up in engagement, but we are a significant way away from a signal that a result is in sight,\u201d the official said. \u201c(But) the use of deadlines, which leads to certain brinkmanship and unnecessary excitement, will not be done again.\u201d A quick recap. Brussels officials have poured cold water over any lingering hopes of a breakthrough deal between Greece and its creditors this week. Friday\u2019s meeting in Riga, which had been inked in as a key deadline, is unlikely to see progress. As one official put it this afternoon: \u201cThere is a clear pick up in activity, there is a clear pick up in engagement, but we are a significant way away from a signal that a result is in sight.\u201d Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem, though, has warned that Greece\u2019s money is running out. The Athens government is facing a revolt from local mayors, who have vowed to fight a demand for their cash reserves. The European Central Bank has raised the pressure on Greece; sources have leaked that the ECB could rein in some the emergency liquidity that is keeping Greece\u2019s banks afloat. That report has driven Greek government debt prices down to new record lows, with yields deeper into danger zone. Greece\u2019s five-year bond is now changing hands at a yield of over 20%. The Greek stock market also fell sharply, with the ATG index closing 3.3% lower at 704 points. I think that\u2019s the lowest level since 2012. Meanwhile in Athens, the boss of Gazprom has met with prime minister Tsipras. There\u2019s doubt, though, that Greece could unlock financial help from Russia by agreeing to a new pipeline. Photos of the meeting between Greece\u2019s PM, Alexis Tsipras, and Gazprom chief Alexei Miller just arrived; it looks pretty cordial. As covered earlier, the two men were expected to discuss cutting Greece\u2019s energy costs, and perhaps a new pipeline to run from Russia through Greek territory. The chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers has warned that the world economy would be badly hit if Greece crashed out of the single currency. In an interview with Reuters in Berlin, Jason Furman swept aside the notion that a Grexit could be contained easily. He said: \u201cA Greek exit would not just be bad for the Greek economy, it would be taking a very large and unnecessary risk with the global economy just when a lot of things are starting to go right.\u201d Here\u2019s the story: White House adviser says \u2018Grexit\u2019 carries major risks Here\u2019s a snap of the irate Greek mayors\u2019 meeting: Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers, has just warned that Greece is running short of time and money. EUROGROUP\u2019S DIJSSELBLOEM: HAVE TO REACH AGREEMENT WITH GREECE IN COMING WEEKS DIJSSELBLOEM: GREECE\u2019S MONEY IS RUNNING OUT DIJSSELBLOEM: GREEK EXIT OF EUROZONE WOULD LEAD TO DANGEROUS INSTABILITY FOR GREECE, EUROPE Over in Athens scenes of pandemonium have erupted as local municipalities gather to discuss what is being described as the government\u2019s \u201coutrageous decision\u201d yesterday to sequester spare funds from local authorities. Helena Smith reports that mayors attending an emergency meeting of the Central Union of Greek Municipalities (KEDE) hurled abuse at the deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas when he announced that the \u201cinternal loan\u201d would be enforced \u201cfor at least two months.\u201d \u201cIs this your democracy?\u201d protestors were heard saying. Media outlets quoted several of the mayors as telling Mardas: \u201cthe money is ours and we will do with it what we want.\u201d Municipalities are demanding that the order be immediately revoked. The Bank of Greece has been told to take these cash reserves with immediate effect, to help cover Greece\u2019s looming debt repayments and wage and pension bills. KEDE, which is expected to meet in emergency session for several hours yet, says it will hit back with a series of protests and demonstrations and take the case to Greece\u2019s Supreme Court, the highest tribunal in the land. Meanwhile in Brussels, EU officials have just revealed that Greece\u2019s lenders (the \u2018institutions\u2019, formally known as the Troika), have been pushing for such a move. EU officials have told reporters in Brussels that Friday\u2019s eurogroup meeting of finance ministers is extremely unlikely to deliver a deal over Greece. So, we could be looking at the May 11 Eurogroup meeting for a breakthrough that would unlock Greek funds. Or possibly even later? Just in: a photo of Greece\u2019s energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis (left) meeting Gazprom chief Alexei Miller today. Eurozone officials are downplaying the chances of a big breakthrough on Greece at Friday\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers: It\u2019s also not expected to be a marathon session: Heads up. EU officials are about to brief the Brussels press pack about Friday\u2019s eurogroup meeting, where Greece will be top of the agenda. Details to follow...... The National Bank of Hungary just became the latest central bank to ease monetary policy; cutting rates by 0.15% to a new record low of 1.8%. Greece\u2019s energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis is starting talks with Gazprom\u2019s CEO Alexey Miller in Athens. On the agenda, a possible gas pipeline deal that could bring cheaper energy to Greece. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Insiders in the governing Syriza party, where Lafazanis heads the militant faction known as the Left Platform, have been telling me this morning that one of the top priorities in discussions today will be achieving a reduction in the price of gas that Greece imports from Russia. Close to 60% of the country\u2019s gas supplies come from Russia but costs are high because supplies are transferred in liquified form by sea tanker making Greek gas among the costliest in Europe. \u201cThe biggest priority in talks today will be getting agreement on reduction of costs. Ideally, we would like to seal a deal where costs are brought down by 20%,\u201d one well-placed source said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about the pipeline and any prepayment that Moscow might make. If an agreement benefits Greece we will sign it and we may just be days away from doing that.\u201d Vasillis Moulopoulos, who presides over the company that owns the Syriza aligned newspaper Avgi, told the Guardian that Athens had every right to pursue a multi-dimensional foreign policy that included reaching out to Russia and China. \u201cEvery other European country does it, so why can\u2019t Greece?...Angela Merkel has been to Moscow three times, but as soon as [Alexis] Tsipras goes, a huge fuss is made.\u201d But Syriza, he said, was also willing to make the compromises necessary to clinch an interim deal with creditors at the EU and IMF to unlock the funds the country now so desperately needs. \u201cIt is clear that Syriza cannot immediately enforce all its pre-election pledges and it is willing to go back on certain things,\u201d he told me, adding that privatisations might be among the concessions the leftists were willing to make. \u201cBut there are certain red lines, such as reducing wages and pensions and doing away with collective work agreements, which exist all over Europe, which we cannot accept. Certain mistakes may have been made on our part as this is a government that lacks experience but on the other hand Europe is also making some absurd demands that no one could accept. This government will not take decisions that are critical for the country if they do not have the endorsement of the people.\u201d Giving added gravitas to the prospect that his leftist-led coalition may resort to early elections or a referendum in the event of deadlock Tsipras repeated, this week that solutions can always be found. \u201cDemocracy cannot be blackmailed,\u201d he said.  Incidentally, energy expert Nikos Tsafos has argued that talk of a \u20ac5bn windfall for Greece from Gazprom could be hot air: Greece\u2019s mayors are up in arms about the government\u2019s order to hand over cash reserves. Associated Press reports: Authorities from municipalities across Greece will hold an emergency meeting Tuesday after the government ordered reserves from state enterprises to be placed in a common account to help the country meet its financial obligations and avoid default. Following an emergency decree, funds from anything from hospitals to local government will be made available for short-term loans to the state. Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis said his municipality would argue the decree was unconstitutional, while other mayors have told local media they are considering appealing the order in court. Opposition parties have expressed outrage. There are also reports from Greece that the transfer will last until the end of May: Greece\u2019s scramble for cash comes as the rest of the eurozone wallows in an ocean of liquidity. This morning, the 3 month Euribor rate \u2013 which measures the cost of lending between eurozone banks \u2013 fell below zero for the first time ever. That means banks have so much cash that they\u2019re actually paying (a little bit) to lend to each other: Economist Shaun Richards is struck by the contrast, saying: There is a flood of liquidity in the Euro area as evidenced by another interest-rate benchmark plunging through the ice into below zero territory. Yet the place that most needs it,Greece, finds itself in a desert lacking liquidity and after last night\u2019s move by its government there must be fears of another deposit outflow. This is a cycle which sucks ever more breath out of the Greek monetary system. The leaders of Greece and Germany will hold talks in Brussels on Thursday, on the sidelines of the emergency EU Summit on migration (that\u2019s via Reuters). Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s analysts believe the crisis could lead to a third bailout, an exit from the Eurozone or a new government. Even if Greece can meet its IMF repayment in May, it faces larger bills in June - and then hefty repayments to the European Central bank over the summer. Greece\u2019s existing bailout expires at the end of June, so further funding will be needed by then. Greece\u2019s finance minister told reporters this morning that talks with creditors are going \u2018very well\u2019, according to Greek newspaper Enikos. Enikos says: Greece\u2019s negotiations with its creditors are going \u201cvery well,\u201d Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told waiting reporters outside the Ministry of Finance Tuesday. Ased how the talks in Paris are going. \u201cVery well, we continue.\u201d Varoufakis did not, however, answer a question on how long can Greece continue to cover its financial needs without assistance, and just wished the reporters a good day. Eirini Tsekeridou, fixed income analyst at Julius Baer, reckons Greece will eventually cave in to its creditors\u2019 demands on taxes, pensions, and privatisations. But given the \u201chigh political instability\u201d, Julius Baer isn\u2019t prepared to hold Greek debt right now. Tsekeridou also warned that yesterday\u2019s decision to take cash reserves from Greek state bodies will only delay Greece\u2019s cash crunch: \u201cWe would like to remind that Greece has to pay \u20ac200m to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 1 May as well as \u20ac1.4bn in maturing Treasury bills on 8 May, while pensions and public sector salaries amount to around \u20ac1.7bn. The risk of missed payment is pushed down the road towards month-end or possibly beginning of May, but the solution found signals desperation and is not viable; the issue will arise sooner rather than later.\u201d This is a notably gloomy tweet from Francesco Papadia, the former director general for Market Operations at the European Central Bank. One of the world\u2019s most powerful investors has predicted that Greece will be \u2018kicked out\u2019 of the eurozone unless it agrees to its creditors demands: Larry Fink, the head of US investment management giant BlackRock, told a conference in Singapore today that: \u201cIf Greece does not capitulate, Europe has no choice but to kick Greece out... The Europeans have no choice but to be firm. The outcome of Greece unwilling to meet its obligation is very negative for Greek citizens.\u201d Despite today\u2019s rumours, analysts at Citi suggest that the ECB probably won\u2019t pull the plug on Greece\u2019s emergency liquidity support this month: (the ECB is due to hold non-monetary policy meetings on those dates) Greece\u2019s stock market has hit its lowest level since Syriza won January\u2019s general election. The reports that the ECB might pull the plug on Greece\u2019s banks are sparking a hefty selloff in Greek bank shares, as these charts show: Unless the market recovers, it could hit its lowest closing level since the heights of the eurozone crisis in 2012: Some reaction to the ZEW survey: Just in: German economic optimism has dropped for the first time since last October, but current conditions remain extremely bright. That\u2019s according to the ZEW Institute latest survey. Its economic sentiment index dipped to 53.3 from 54.8 last month, showing more caution However, its current conditions index jumped to 70.2, up from 55 last month; the highest since July 2011. That shows that analysts believe the German economy is currently in rather decent shape. Here\u2019s the Bloomberg story that has rattled the Greek stock market, pushed down the euro, and raised new fears that Greece could default: The European Central Bank is studying measures to rein in Emergency Liquidity Assistance to Greek banks, as resistance to further aiding the country\u2019s stricken lenders grows in the Governing Council, people with knowledge of the discussions said. ECB staff have produced a proposal to increase the haircuts banks take on the collateral they post when borrowing from the Bank of Greece, the people said, asking not to be named as the matter is private. While the measure hasn\u2019t been formally discussed by the Governing Council, it may be considered if Greece\u2019s leaders fail to quickly convince euro-area finance ministers they can reform their economy and secure bailout funds, one of the people said. Greek lenders are mostly locked out of regular ECB cash tenders while the country\u2019s government, which holds talks with euro-area partners in Riga this week, tussles with its creditors over the much-needed aid payments. Instead, the banks currently have access to about \u20ac74bn ($79bn) of emergency funds from their own central bank -- an amount that has been rising and which will be reviewed this week. There\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d that the ECB is losing patience with Greece, said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist at Credit Agricole CIB in Paris. \u201cGreek banks will need more funding before long, so in a way larger haircuts or a lower ELA cap are equivalent.\u201d The ECB staff proposal outlines three routes for reducing the amount of cash lenders can access for a given amount of collateral, one of the people said. The haircuts set under ELA operations aren\u2019t public. An ECB spokesman declined to comment.... Full story: ECB Is Studying Curbs on Greek Bank Support Paul Mason of Channel 4 has his suspicions over the timing of this leak: Default fears are hitting Greek bonds too, pushing prices down to even more worrying levels: The two-year Greek bond yield (or interest rate) hit 29.4% this morning. The Athens stock market is dropping in early trading as fears over Greece\u2019s finances rise. The ATG index has shed 2%, led by Piraeus Bank, which has tumbled by 12.5%. More leaks from the European Central Bank, suggesting it may impose tighter rules on Greek banks in return for emergency liquidity. Some analysts are speculating that the ECB is unhappy about yesterday\u2019s decree, forcing local authorities to transfer their cash funds to the ECB. That move would drain cash out of commercial banks, making them more reliant on the ECB\u2019s emergency funds. Gazprom chief Alexie Miller is visiting Athens today to discuss \u201ccurrent energy issues of interest\u201d with prime minister Alexis Tsipras, according to the energy ministry. The ministry declined to comment on rumours that Gazprom could pay up to \u20ac5bn to Greece in return for deal to extend its planned Turkish Stream gas pipeline. Such a cash injection could be crucial for Athens. But as the AFP newswire explains, it\u2019s not a done deal: If the deal is indeed sealed, any advance payment would be a welcome source of revenues for Greece, which is struggling to unlock 7.2 billion euros in desperately needed international bailout funds. Analysts are however sceptical, as the Turkish Stream pipeline is not expected to come into service until 2019 and Ankara and Moscow are struggling to come to a final deal. \u201c2019 is a long way into the future. I\u2019d be surprised if Russia were really to pay Greece such an amount of money four years in advance for a risky project which still needs to be vetted by EU regulators,\u201d said Holger Schmieding of Berenberg bank. European stock markets are still shrugging the Greek crisis off, though: The euro has lost ground in the currency markets this morning, dropping almost 0.7% against the US dollar to $1.066. Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets says Greece continues to weigh on investors\u2019 minds today. There is unease surrounding Russia\u2019s role in the situation, he says - fuelled by Gazprom chief Alexie Miller\u2019s trip to Athens. Could Putin afford to extend his hand to the troubled nation? Some think not, which is seen as a good thing while others are genuinely worried that he can and will According to reports, The Kremlin is willing to offer up to \u20ac4.5B to Athens as an advance for a planned natural gas pipeline through the country. Just in: Wonga has posted a \u00a337m loss for 2014, even bigger than expected, as the clampdown on Britain\u2019s payday loan industry hits home.

Executive chairman Andy Haste admits there is more work to do: \u201cWe know it will take time to repair our reputation and gain an accepted place in the financial services industry, but we\u2019re determined to deliver on our plans and serve our customers in the right way.\u201d The European Central Bank is considering reining in its support for Greek banks, as concern grows in Frankfurt over Greece\u2019s bailout talks. That would potentially put Greek banks in an even trickier position, as they are relying on the ECB\u2019s emergency funding to stay afloat. Here\u2019s the story: The European Central Bank is studying measures to rein in Emergency Liquidity Assistance to Greek banks, as resistance to further aiding the country\u2019s stricken lenders grows in the Governing Council, people with knowledge of the discussions said. ECB staff have produced a proposal to increase the haircuts banks take on the collateral they post when borrowing from the Bank of Greece, the people said, asking not to be named as the matter is private. While the measure hasn\u2019t been formally discussed by the Governing Council, it may be considered if Greece\u2019s leaders fail to quickly convince euro-area finance ministers they can reform their economy and secure bailout funds, one of the people said. Full story: ECB Is Studying Curbs on Greek Bank Support The Greek people may be losing faith in their government\u2019s strategy, according to a new opinion poll. TV station Skai found that 45% of people agree with the stance, down from over 70% two months ago: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears over Greece continue to build, after Athens issued a decree yesterday ordering local authorities to move their cash reserves to the central bank. The move has intensified speculation that Greece is running out of funds to meet its obligations, as Stan Shamu of IG explains: The Greece situation is starting to escalate yet again and given the dire situation the country is in, some analysts are already speculating on a third bailout. Greece is in a tough cash position and latest reports suggest Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has ordered local governments to deposit reserves with the central bank. The situation is very time sensitive at the moment and it seems unlikely we\u2019ll see a solution by the key dates. The issue of a Grexit will also remain on investors\u2019 minds and many will ponder exactly what sort of an impact this would have on the region. Given Greece has a lot more to lose than the euro area, many feel the country will end up succumbing to the eurozone\u2019s demands despite attempting to put up a fight. Perhaps this is why the single currency is not completely crumbling on Greece fears. Fears that Greek banks may soon run out of the collateral they need to access emergency ECB funding also looms over the eurozone: But could Gazprom step into the breach? The head of the Russian energy giant is heading to Athens for talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras today; could a deal to build a pipeline through Greece be on the cards? There were reports on Sunday (later denied) that this could be worth \u20ac5bn to Greece. Alexei Miller\u2019s visit is also overshadowed by the news that the EU is bringing anti-competition charges against Gazprom later this week. Also coming up today... We get a new healthcheck on the German economy at 10am BST, when the ZEW Institute publishes its latest survey of investor confidence. And in the UK, payday loan firm Wonga is due to release financial results shortly. It\u2019s expected to post a sizeable loss of perhaps \u00a335m, following a regulatory clampdown.

On the agenda, a possible gas pipeline deal that could bring cheaper energy to Greece. </strong></p> <h2>Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: </h2> <p>Insiders in the governing Syriza party, where Lafazanis heads the militant faction known as the Left Platform, have been telling me this morning that one of the top priorities in discussions today will be achieving a reduction in the price of gas that Greece imports from Russia. </p> <p>Close to 60% of the country\u2019s gas supplies come from Russia but costs are high because supplies are transferred in liquified form by sea tanker making Greek gas among the costliest in Europe. </p> <p>\u201cThe biggest priority in talks today will be getting agreement on reduction of costs. Ideally, we would like to seal a deal where costs are brought down by 20%,\u201d one well-placed source said. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only about the pipeline and any prepayment that Moscow might make. If an agreement benefits Greece we will sign it and we may just be days away from doing that.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Vasillis Moulopoulos</strong>, who presides over the company that owns the Syriza aligned newspaper Avgi, told the Guardian that Athens had every right to pursue a multi-dimensional foreign policy that included reaching out to Russia and China. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cEvery other European country does it, so why can\u2019t Greece?...Angela Merkel has been to Moscow three times, but as soon as [Alexis] Tsipras goes, a huge fuss is made.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But Syriza, he said, was also willing to make the compromises necessary to clinch an interim deal with creditors at the EU and IMF to unlock the funds the country now so desperately needs. </p> <p>\u201cIt is clear that Syriza cannot immediately enforce all its pre-election pledges and it is willing to go back on certain things,\u201d he told me, adding that privatisations might be among the concessions the leftists were willing to make.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cBut there are certain red lines, such as reducing wages and pensions and doing away with collective work agreements, which exist all over Europe, which we cannot accept. Certain mistakes may have been made on our part as this is a government that lacks experience but on the other hand Europe is also making some absurd demands that no one could accept. This government will not take decisions that are critical for the country if they do not have the endorsement of the people.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Giving added gravitas to the prospect that his leftist-led coalition may resort to early elections or a referendum in the event of deadlock Tsipras repeated, this week that solutions can always be found. \u201cDemocracy cannot be blackmailed,\u201d he said. &lt;end&gt;</p> <p><strong>Incidentally, energy expert <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/nikos-tsafos/12/252/b70?trk=pulse-det-athr_prof-art_hdr\">Nikos Tsafos</a> has argued that talk of a \u20ac5bn windfall for Greece from Gazprom could be hot air: </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ntsafos/statuses/590476383308025856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Deflating the Russia-Greece <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/energy?src=hash\">#energy</a> connection <a href=\"http://t.co/foBszInAAo\">http://t.co/foBszInAAo</a></p>&mdash; Nikos Tsafos (@ntsafos) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ntsafos/status/590476383308025856\">April 21, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55363673e4b0ae1332c0b0a7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-21T11:50:23.099Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek local authorities revolt over cash grab</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greece\u2019s mayors are up in arms about the government\u2019s order to hand over cash reserves.</strong><br></p> <p>Associated Press reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Authorities from municipalities across Greece will hold an emergency meeting Tuesday after the government ordered reserves from state enterprises to be placed in a common account to help the country meet its financial obligations and avoid default.</p> <p> Following an emergency decree, funds from anything from hospitals to local government will be made available for short-term loans to the state.</p> <p> Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis said his municipality would argue the decree was unconstitutional, while other mayors have told local media they are considering appealing the order in court.

      "bodyText": "Her hands weighed down with seven rings she previously bought here, Sandie Taylor is back at the counter of H&amp;T Pawnbrokers in Kingston upon Thames, handing over the final payment on the bracelet she left six months ago. For the \u00a3100 loan she took out, she is repaying \u00a3151. \u201cIt is just convenient really,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it is Christmas, I am in here practically every week. \u201cI have a lot more gold than what I need to wear so when it is sitting indoors and I need money, it is easy to come down.\u201d Taylor is the kind of customer pawnbrokers regard as their traditional business \u2013 coming to the high street for accessible cash rather than going online, putting down engagement rings, watches and coins for up to six months. The typical loan is between \u00a3200 and \u00a3400 at an interest rate of between 5% and 10%, with gold rings still the most typical piece of security. The industry claims to cater for up to 11 million people who it says do not have access to bank loans. In recent recessionary years its core customers were joined by a new influx from the middle classes, also in need of short-term finance. \u201cObviously the banks had not been lending like they were so it became a credible source of alternative finance for larger numbers of people,\u201d said Ray Perry of the National Pawnbrokers Association. The business has clearly progressed from the days of the \u201clow, dirty-looking, dusty shop\u201d Charles Dickens described in Sketches by Boz, \u201cthe door of which stands always doubtfully, a little way open: half inviting, half repelling the hesitating visitor\u201d. Now ubiquitous on the high street \u2013 often fitted out in a sober but functional fashion much like a local jewellers \u2013 the pawnbroker\u2019s progress from backstreets to relative prosperity tells a story of harsh economic conditions and, for a time, the surging price of gold. John Nichols, the chief executive of H&amp;T Pawnbrokers, recalls a period in the late 1990s when there were between 500 and 600 shops overall in the UK \u2013 at the beginning of last year the number stood at 2,100. But rapid expansion had already come to an end, with a gold price crash in 2013 steep enough to force major chain Albemarle &amp; Bond into administration. The company, which two years earlier had declared it was \u201cthe age of the pawnbroker\u201d and opened 40 pop-up shops to buy punters\u2019 gold, had to melt down and sell gold items in its shops to shore up finances. In April last year, Albemarle was bought out of administration by the investment group of the former Bank of Scotland boss Sir Peter Burt. Now the industry faces an uncertain future. The twin effects of the gold price plunge and the attractions of online payday lending \u2013 anonymity and instant access \u2013 have pushed traditional pawnbrokers into a \u201ctrough\u201d, says analyst Jonathan De Mello, of retail property advisers Harper Dennis Hobbs. \u201cThey [pawnbrokers] still have the structural issues they face where it is cheaper to offer loans online,\u201d he said. \u201cThe payday loan sector [for pawnbrokers] has seen structural decline. The gold sector has seen structural decline, so essentially I wouldn\u2019t say the writing is on the wall, but there is going to be a lot of churning and consolidation and the number of pawnbrokers will continue to decline.\u201d Online lenders have their own well-publicised difficulties, with leading lender Wonga announcing its first loss on Tuesday after a series of scandals, and a wider regulatory crackdown on the industry having capped the annual interest rate at 1,500%. The online payday loan sector itself has become a battleground between 20 different companies, said De Mello. Pawnbrokers do at least, he said, have other areas of business \u2013 gold and jewellery \u2013 whereas the online competition is limited to payday loans. But the number of pawnbroking shops now stands at 1,950 and De Mello thinks this will reduce to between 1,600 and 1,700. He expects operators that have previously let sites on high streets to come under increased competition in the bigger population centres such as London and Manchester as mainstream retailers move to take up space again. As a representative of the industry, Perry is less gloomy but still predicts \u201cnothing dynamic\u201d in the next four years. He believes pawnbrokers will be shored up by the middle-class customers they have gained. Meanwhile H&amp;T has reduced its shops from 199 to 191 and Nichols said the trend is for people to take smaller loans than previously. But there remains a need for what pawnbrokers offer, he maintains. \u201cI think there is still a great need out there for people to access cash quickly but in a safe manner. People do, whether we like it or not, always have [a need for] short-term credit.\u201d De Mello said banks have not yet returned to the type of lending they engaged in before the crash, meaning some will always need alternative finance. \u201cOne thing in their favour, the banks are still not lending like they used to and they never will with the sub-prime crisis. They are very careful now,\u201d he said. Back in Kingston, there is a steady stream of customers for the three staff. Bulgari watches, half sovereign coins and gold chains are packed in plastic, labelled and stored in careful order in the safes. Staff say they will look at anything as security \u2013 including in one case a herd of cows. In another extreme case Sonya Lancaster, who has worked there for three-and-a-half years, recalls a man coming in with a small bag of gold \u2013 10 fillings from the teeth of relatives who had passed away.",

Pawnbrokers do at least, he said, have other areas of business \u2013 gold and jewellery \u2013 whereas the online competition is limited to payday loans.</p> <p>But the number of pawnbroking shops now stands at 1,950 and De Mello thinks this will reduce to between 1,600 and 1,700. He expects operators that have previously let sites on high streets to come under increased competition in the bigger population centres such as London and Manchester as mainstream retailers move to take up space again.</p> <p>As a representative of the industry, Perry is less gloomy but still predicts \u201cnothing dynamic\u201d in the next four years. He believes pawnbrokers will be shored up by the middle-class customers they have gained.</p> <p>Meanwhile H&amp;T has reduced its shops from 199 to 191 and Nichols said the trend is for people to take smaller loans than previously.</p> <p>But there remains a need for what pawnbrokers offer, he maintains. \u201cI think there is still a great need out there for people to access cash quickly but in a safe manner. People do, whether we like it or not, always have [a need for] short-term credit.\u201d</p> <p>De Mello said banks have not yet returned to the type of lending they engaged in before the crash, meaning some will always need alternative finance. \u201cOne thing in their favour, the banks are still not lending like they used to and they never will with the sub-prime crisis. They are very careful now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Back in Kingston, there is a steady stream of customers for the three staff. Bulgari watches, half sovereign coins and gold chains are packed in plastic, labelled and stored in careful order in the safes. Staff say they will look at anything as security \u2013 including in one case a herd of cows. In another extreme case Sonya Lancaster, who has worked there for three-and-a-half years, recalls a man coming in with a small bag of gold \u2013 10 fillings from the teeth of relatives who had passed away.</p>",

In January this year, the cities minister, Greg Clark, using ONS statistics, argued that 60% of new jobs since 2010 have come from outside London and the south-east, and that the eight core cities other than London have seen jobs rise by more than 250,000 since 2010. He went on to argue that while the \u201cpicture of a north-south divide pulling apart was certainly true in the previous decade \u2026 in this decade it is changing. North and south are now pulling in the same direction, which is upwards\u201d (<em>Management Journal for Local Authority Business, 22 January, 2015</em>). The impression given was that the north-south divide is history. But is this true?<br></p> <p>The fact is that the north-south divide is a long-standing and highly entrenched feature of the UK\u2019s economic landscape, going back to the nineteenth century. Since the 1970s, the gap has in fact progressively widened. What really matters is not the growth record over just a short period, such as the recovery from the recent recession, but the cumulative growth gap over successive decades. As the graphic shows, in terms of growth of output (Gross Value Added), the south has consistently pulled ahead of the north over the past 40 years: between 1971 and 2013, the south (including London) recorded a 30 percentage point cumulative growth lead over the north. What is also evident is the striking turnaround in London\u2019s differential performance. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c277a698920af6f8d03853cf444d354906f79c8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/21/1429615496885/6a802c85-3cc7-4045-b302-337db89c036c-460x326.png\" alt=\"Growth chart\" width=\"460\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cumulative percentage point differential growth measured as the running sum of the difference between annual regional growth and national (UK) growth rates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Up until the beginning of the 1990s its growth lagged that nationally, but since then it has had the fastest growth rate of any UK region, and this divergent performance has shown no signs of slowing in the last few years. What these cumulative trends demonstrate is the magnitude of the \u201ccatch-up\u201d needed to reduce the economic disparities between the regions, and especially between London and the south-east on the one hand, and the rest of the UK on the other (see table). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54ede831b05ba65246eb54954713d63e7ae75c71\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/21/1429615591011/17227224-08d0-41dc-a575-c3be0a875672-460x365.png\" alt=\"Gross Value per capita in the UK regions, 1983-2013 (UK=100)\" width=\"460\" height=\"365\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gross Value per capita in the UK regions, 1983-2013 (UK=100).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even if the north and south are now \u201cpulling in the same direction\u201d, in the sense of achieving the same growth rates, regional relativities will simply remain unchanged, while absolute differentials will continue to widen. The north would have to achieve a significantly faster rate of growth than the south and sustain this for some considerable time for the north-south divide to close, and for the economy to become spatially balanced. </p> <p> The north-south divide is very far from being history, and closing it remains a highly challenging task. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2015/mar/18/northern-powerhouse-is-north-really-winner-2015-budget\">government\u2019s desire to promote a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d to rival London in scale</a> and growth is a welcome step in the right direction. But this sort of spatial strategy will need to be repeated in other parts of the country, and to be far bolder, more decentralist in nature, and more expansive in scale, if the UK\u2019s north-south divide is to be a thing of the past.<br></p> <ul> <li><em>Ron Martin is professor of economic geography at the University of Cambridge.</em><br></li> </ul>",

North and south are now pulling in the same direction, which is upwards\u201d (Management Journal for Local Authority Business, 22 January, 2015). The impression given was that the north-south divide is history. But is this true? The fact is that the north-south divide is a long-standing and highly entrenched feature of the UK\u2019s economic landscape, going back to the nineteenth century. Since the 1970s, the gap has in fact progressively widened. What really matters is not the growth record over just a short period, such as the recovery from the recent recession, but the cumulative growth gap over successive decades. As the graphic shows, in terms of growth of output (Gross Value Added), the south has consistently pulled ahead of the north over the past 40 years: between 1971 and 2013, the south (including London) recorded a 30 percentage point cumulative growth lead over the north. What is also evident is the striking turnaround in London\u2019s differential performance. Up until the beginning of the 1990s its growth lagged that nationally, but since then it has had the fastest growth rate of any UK region, and this divergent performance has shown no signs of slowing in the last few years. What these cumulative trends demonstrate is the magnitude of the \u201ccatch-up\u201d needed to reduce the economic disparities between the regions, and especially between London and the south-east on the one hand, and the rest of the UK on the other (see table). Even if the north and south are now \u201cpulling in the same direction\u201d, in the sense of achieving the same growth rates, regional relativities will simply remain unchanged, while absolute differentials will continue to widen. The north would have to achieve a significantly faster rate of growth than the south and sustain this for some considerable time for the north-south divide to close, and for the economy to become spatially balanced. The north-south divide is very far from being history, and closing it remains a highly challenging task. The government\u2019s desire to promote a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d to rival London in scale and growth is a welcome step in the right direction. But this sort of spatial strategy will need to be repeated in other parts of the country, and to be far bolder, more decentralist in nature, and more expansive in scale, if the UK\u2019s north-south divide is to be a thing of the past.

      "bodyText": "Payday loan firm Wonga has announced a pretax loss of \u00a337m, a big change from 2012 when the firm made \u00a362m. Here\u2019s a timeline showing the firm\u2019s rise, and how things have gone wrong in recent years: 2006: Company founded by Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz 2007: Wonga launches beta version of its website It offers loans of up to \u00a31,000 repaid after up to 30 days. It promises almost instant decisions. July 2008: Full launch. At this point the firm employs 37 staff in London with a development team in the Ukraine. Co-founder Damelin tells the Guardian that 50,000 customers were served during our testing phase and he expected \u201cto help many more over the next 12 months\u201d. December 2010: Sponsorship of New Year\u2019s Eve travel attracts criticism. Campaigners, including the Labour MP Stella Creasy, condemn decision to let Wonga advertise across London transport in exchange for paying for all-night transport. January 2011: Stella Creasy calls for cap on cost of borrowing. The Labour MP manages to secure a vote against what she calls \u201clegal loan sharks\u201d. The resolution is rejected but calls for a cost cap continue. March 2011: Firm named Digital Entrepreneur of the year by the Guardian June 2011: Stories start to emerge of struggling borrowers; in October the Observer covers how Wonga had lent money to a couple living on benefits. October 2011: Jonty Hurwitz resigns operationally from the company and leaves. January 2012: Wonga withdraws student loans information from its website after an outcry over a page which told students its service was more flexible than student loans. February 2012: Office of Fair Trading launches payday lending review. The regulator announces it will investigate the 50 biggest lenders over concerns they are exploiting vulnerable people. Wonga is asked to make changes as a result of the investigation. March 2012: Controversy grows around the company. It is spending \u00a316m a year on advertising, has made around 3.5m loans and claims its customers are web-savvy people who choose not to use big banks. But when the Guardian speaks to the very people that Wonga puts forward it finds a different story. May 2012: OFT finds it has been accusing struggling customers of fraud and tells it to improve its debt collection practices. In the same month it launches Wonga for business, offering loans of up to \u00a310,000 to businesses arranged over one to 52 weeks with interest rate starting at 17%. The service never really takes off, it eventually changes its name, and is sold in February 2015. September 2012: Reports it has trebled its earnings in 2011. Around 2.5m loans were taken out over the year and Wonga\u2019s net income rose 269% to \u00a345.8m on revenues of \u00a3185m. November 2012: Abusive tweets to Labour MP traced to Wonga employee. The lender has to apologise after the Guardian discovers source of tweets sent to Stella Creasy. January 2013: Bad debts start to rise along with profits. It emerges that the company wrote off almost \u00a377m of bad loans in 2011 \u2013 41% of its \u00a3185m revenues for the year and almost four times the figure for 2010. March 2013: Payday lenders given reform ultimatum. The OFT gives lenders including Wonga 12 weeks to change their business practices after finding evidence of irresponsible lending and breaches of the law. July 2013: Archbishop of Canterbury speaks out. Justin Welby says he wants to \u2018compete\u2019 Wonga out of existence with credit unions. September 2013: Reports profits of more than \u00a31m a week in 2012. Results show profits increased by 36% to \u00a362m with 1m customers in five countries taking loans. However, write-offs increased to \u00a396m as Wonga made a \u00a3126m provision for impairments. October 2013: FCA announces tougher controls. The regulator outlines a crackdown on extending loans and how money is collected from customers which will come into force in July 2014. Lenders will no longer be able to roll over loans more than twice or to make repeated unsuccessful attempts to take money from borrowers\u2019 bank accounts. These practices had made it less risky for lenders to offer money to people who might not be able to afford repayments. November 2013: George Osborne announces that the FCA will put into place a cost cap on lenders. In the same month the company announces that Errol Damelin will move to a part-time role. May 2014: New boss, Niall Wass, quits after just six months in the job. June 2014: \u00a32.6m compensation bill for fake debt firm letters. The FCA finds that between October 2008 and November 2010 Wonga sent letters from fake law firms to borrowers who had fallen behind on repayments. The matter is referred to the police, but an investigation is eventually ruled out. July 2014: New rules for payday lenders come into effect. In the same month, Wonga appoints Andy Haste as chairman, who scraps the puppets and other light-hearted advertising straight away, and says the firm is going to get smaller and less profitable. September 2014: Announces that profits have halved. Wonga says it made \u00a339.7m in 2013, a fall of 53% on 2012\u2019s profits. Compensating customers for fake letters has cost it \u00a318.8m, Wonga says. October 2014: Writes off \u00a3220m of loans to 375,000 borrowers. Around 330,000 people who are more than 30 days in arrears have debts cleared and a further 45,000 have interest and charges wiped after the FCA finds Wonga did not check customers could afford repayments. It is forced to change affordability tests. December 2014: Cuts its interest rate to meet new charge cap. Interest rate cut to 0.8% a day and other costs reduced to conform with a legal cap on costs coming into force on 2 January 2015. February 2015: Firm announces it will cut 325 jobs. Announces it will cut a third of its workforce. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 April 2015 to correct the date when Jonty Hurwitz left Wonga.",
