      "bodyText": "The boss of the French state-owned company behind the UK\u2019s first new nuclear power station for 20 years has threatened to pull the plug on the \u00a318bn project without further backing from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government. Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, chief executive of EDF, said he needed more financial support from the Elys\u00e9e Palace to proceed with construction of the plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset. A letter sent to the company\u2019s staff admits the \u201ctense\u201d financial situation at EDF and the potential danger to a scheme that is at the centre of British energy policy. \u201cWe are negotiating with the [French] state to obtain commitments allowing us to secure our financial position. It is clear that I will not engage in this EDF project as long as these conditions are not met,\u201d said L\u00e9vy. Pressure on the EDF bosss increased last week when his finance director resigned, saying Hinkley needed to be postponed for at least three years while the company restructured its finances. French trade unions on its board, angry at planned job cuts in France, have also called for Hinkley to be shelved. Those concerns were echoed on Thursday by country\u2019s top public auditor, which warned over the cost and complexity of the project. Explaining why he was taking the usual step of addressing staff, L\u00e9vy said: \u201cIn recent weeks, our group is the subject of much debate, especially around the renewal of our nuclear fleet and the construction of two EPR [European pressurised reactors] in the UK at Hinkley Point C. \u201cYou know, the financial situation is tense, and this issue deserves to be clarified. I receive your messages of encouragement, but I also hear some concerns. That is why I address myself directly to you.\u201d Despite the problems facing the group, L\u00e9vy underlined both his and the French government\u2019s desire to make the Hinkley project successful. \u201cHinkley Point C has the support of the French government and the British government, which places it at the heart of new nuclear energy policy. The UK needs to secure its supply of electricity and decarbonise its energy mix.\u201d Referring to the British government subsidy for the project, represented by a guaranteed electricity price of \u00a392.50/MWh , he added: \u201cI am convinced of the robustness of the guaranteed selling price, approved by Brussels.\u201d EDF\u2019s share price has slumped and its debts have risen over recent years. It has also been hit by falling energy prices and demands from the French government that it took over ailing nuclear engineering group Areva. Its difficulties have put enormous pressure on the British government, which has already promised generous financial subsidies for Hinkley, to be paid for by taxpayers. The subsidy agreements have drawn scorn from investment bankers in the City. One analyst earlier this week described the Hinkley project as \u201cinsane\u201d because of the problems EDF and Areva had experienced at similar schemes at Flamanville in Normandy and Olkiluoto in Finland. The Japanese prime minister at the time of the Fukushima nuclear accident has warned that nuclear power is unsafe and too expensive to justify building new plants anywhere in the world. Speaking on the fifth anniversary of the disaster on Friday, Naoto Kan said he was against the idea of Japanese manufacturers such as Hitachi and Toshiba building nuclear plants in the UK. \u201cNuclear power is not safe. In the worst case scenario up to 50 million people would have had to be evacuated. Nuclear power is not a suitable technology and renewable power is much better,\u201d Kan told the Guardian. He insisted he did not want to tell other countries such as Britain what to do but said he did not support the reactors being switched back on in Japan. Neither did he support the idea of Japanese companies working on new nuclear schemes. While EDF is at the centre of the Hinkley scheme, Hitachi and Toshiba are behind similar initiatives being developed for new reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey, Oldbury in south Gloucestershire, and Sellafield in Cumbria. Kan said it did not make sense to construct new atomic plants because of the cost, especially in those countries where there were no long-term storage facilities for high-level radioactive waste. This includes Britain and Japan. \u201cWhat I experienced as prime minister made me feel that it does not make sense to rely on nuclear. New generation plant designs are supposed to increase safety but all these do is increase the cost,\u201d he added. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of Britain\u2019s atomic lobby group, the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said he was comfortable that Hinkley and the other reactors being planned in Britain would be safe because they would go through the UK\u2019s most rigorous regulatory scrutiny. \u201cThe process of assessing the reactor design is done in a different way in the UK and that gives confidence that the reactor design [EDF\u2019s European pressurised reactors] will be safe and that is what we need to see,\u201d he said. A spokesperson from the Department of Energy and Climate Change said the safety of British reactors would be paramount. \u201cAny nuclear power station built in the UK will need to comply with our world-leading nuclear safety regulation. \u201cThe British government is backing new nuclear. It is an important part of our plan to give hardworking families and businesses clean, affordable and secure energy that they can rely on now and in the future.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After Terrible Thursday came Fantastic Friday. Or maybe Freaky Friday, since many commentators were puzzled by the strong recovery today after the slump yesterday which followed ECB president Mario Draghi seemingly playing down further interest rate cuts. Part of the revival came as investors had second thoughts and decided to concentrate on the positive elements of Draghi\u2019s announcement, namely the rate cut he did unveil, the plan to buy corporate bonds and the fact the ECB will be paying banks to lend to companies in an effort to boost the flagging eurozone economy. On top of that, markets were buoyed by a rise in crude as the International Energy Agency said the oil price might have bottomed out and hopes grew that producers would come to an agreement to freeze output. Brent is currently up 0.9% at $40.41. With the ECB stimulus measures outweighing the problem of negative interest rates stretching their balance sheets, banks were among the days main gainers with the Euro Stoxx Banks index ended 6.7% higher at 115. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 1.7% or 103.09 points at 6139.79, albeit down 0.99% on the week, its first weekly fall since the middle of February Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 3.5% to 9831.13 France\u2019s Cac closed 3.2% higher at 4492.79 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB soared 4.8% to 18,987.73 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 3.69% at 9090.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.37% to 566.20 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 217 points or 1.2% higher. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week for, among other things, the UK budget and the latest interest rate decisoins from the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: After markets tanked on Thursday it was bounce-back Friday. On the one hand this feels like a bet on central bankers and how far they are willing to go in their pursuit of pumping up the economy. On the other hand it feels like a desperate play; where else do investors put their money to gain a decent income? Markets have given a - belated - vote of confidence to the ECB stimulus package, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: Investors seem more willing to give Mario Draghi the benefit of the doubt today, having sulked yesterday afternoon. Markets in the UK, Europe and the US are racing higher, with the plan apparently being to put the madness of Thursday\u2019s session firmly behind them. Overall it looks like the ECB has been given a vote of confidence, even if it took 24 hours for the result to come through. The session has been somewhat spoiled as oil has failed to hold on to its gains for the day, but the resilience of crude prices this week has come as a rude shock to those that thought a sell-off would develop. Dip buyers in both equities and crude oil continue to be rewarded for their bravery, so it look like these price moves are set to extend into the second half of March. Brent crude, by the way, is still in positive territory - up 0.8% at $40.37 a barrel -but off its earlier highs of $41.03. Despite concerns that the ECB - and indeed other central banks - might be running out of ammunition in their attempts to stimulate economic growth, this is not the case according to bond manager Pimco. Commenting on Thursday\u2019s ECB package Andrew Bosomworth, head of Pimco\u2019s portfolio management in Germany, said: The ECB\u2019s decisions sent three signals. First, negative interest rates as a tool of monetary policy are effectively exhausted. Second, asset purchases and credit easing will do the heavy lifting of policy stimulus going forward. And third, the ECB is focused on the domestic credit channel to kick-start growth rather than lowering the euro. While the ECB has yet to provide details on its expanded purchase programme, our initial thoughts are that it will purchase about \u20ac4 billion in non-financial corporate bonds per month. By adding corporate bonds to its list of government, agency and covered bonds as well as asset-backed securities, the ECB is now firmly in the realm of credit easing. Although we acknowledge the marginal efficacy of monetary policy is declining, we disagree with the view the ECB has run out of ammunition. There remains a large amount of assets outstanding that the ECB could theoretically purchase. And now that it has started with corporate bonds, blue-chip equities are not a far step away, if ever needed. We concur with President Mario Draghi\u2019s response to the question about helicopter money: We think the ECB is a long way from contemplating forms of monetization, and if history is any lesson, investors aren\u2019t keen on monetization, either. The full commentary is here: Not Giving Up The UK government has announced Tom Scholar as the new permanent secretary to the Treasury: Scholar is currently the Prime Minister\u2019s adviser on European and Global Issues and Head of the European and Global Issues Secretariat in the Cabinet Office. This will come as no real surprise, but the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Bundesbank was opposed to the bigger than expected stimulus package unveiled by ECB president Mario Draghi on Thursday. It said (\u00a3): Germany\u2019s Bundesbank opposed the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus package as structured Thursday and fears a \u201cdoom loop\u201d of high market expectations followed by disappointment, people familiar with the matter said. Worth remembering of course that because of the ECB\u2019s rotation policy, Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann had no vote at Thursday\u2019s meeting. Meanwhile CNBC has suggested that Draghi\u2019s later comments at the press conference suggesting rates would not fall further could have been an olive branch to dissenters (presumably the Bundesbank). Much of the future direction of the oil price depends on the outcome of any talks between producers to freeze output, says Dougie Youngson, head of oil and gas research at FinnCap: Brent finally broke through $41 a barrel, its highest level since December last year. The key question now is this recent surge sustainable? Forecasts from both the IEA and EIA are showing that non-OPEC production if declining over this year and next. This decline being driven by output losses in Iraq and Nigeria as well as Iran\u2019s post sanction impact not being a large as originally thought. Crucially, US production is now showing monthly declines which may in time lead to a greater dependence upon imports. The IEA is now forecasting that demand will increase by 1.2mmbbl/d this year. We are therefore seeing supply and demand approaching parity which would be very good news for the oil price and would hopefully see prices being more fundamentally driven. So in terms of what is being forecast, things are looking better. However, forecasts can change and I do think that there is quite a lot of hope priced into the oil price on the \u201cbig freeze\u201d idea with Saudi, Russia and a few of the other more junior members of OPEC. We are still awaiting confirmation that the freeze will occur, but this is not expected for a few weeks yet. If as the market expects, the freeze does occur we can hope to see further strengthening of the oil price as we move into the second half of this year. Hope springs eternal\u2026 US markets have followed the lead from Europe, and are moving sharply higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 179 points or just over 1%, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq have also recorded similar percentage gains. The recovery came as investors had second - and more positive - thoughts about the European Central Banks stimulus measures announced on Thursday. A rise in the crude price, with Brent currently up 2% at $40.85, also helped sentiment. The International Energy Agency said today the oil price may have bottomed out, while there are continuing hopes that producers may agree to act to curb the supply glut. In the UK, MPs have criticised a member of the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee for not mentioning the risks posed by Brexit in her evidence at a hearing for her reappointment. The Treasury committee said Dame Clara Furse\u2019s written evidence was a cause for concern, but it still approved her re-appointment, as well as that of Richard Sharp. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: As with her appointment hearing in 2013, parts of Dame Clara\u2019s evidence were a source of concern to the Committee. The Committee was in agreement that Dame Clara did not appear to have taken enough care with her written evidence. The Committee found it surprising that Dame Clara had not only omitted any reference to the financial stability risks posed by Brexit but, when asked why, appeared unable to provide a clear explanation [for neglecting it]. Here\u2019s Reuters take on the comments by ECB vice-president today, in the wake of the market volatility caused by president Mario Draghi announcing a bold stimulus package only to undermine it almost immediately by saying that there may be no more rate cuts: The European Central Bank\u2019s negative deposit rate is facing limits, the ECB\u2019s vice-president said on Friday. \u201cNaturally, all policies have limits,\u201d Vitor Constancio said in an opinion piece published on the bank\u2019s website and entitled \u2018In defence of Monetary Policy\u2019. \u201cIn the case of the instruments we are now using, this is particularly true of negative interest rates on our deposit facility.\u201d ECB President Mario Draghi sent the euro and yields on short-term government bonds rallying on Thursday when he said the bank did not anticipate any further rate cut after the ones he had just announced. \u201cA succession of scares haunted global markets in the first six weeks of 2016\u201d \u2013 but \u201cone by one these concerns are now being debunked by reality and policy makers,\u201d writes Holger Schmieding, chief economist at German bank Berenberg. He concludes: China \u2013 no hard landing. Oil prices \u2013 no reason to worry. US \u2013 on track. ECB \u2013 good for banks, good for the economy. On the latter point: The ECB did not just exceed expectations with its comprehensive policy package of 10 March. Its new stimulus is designed to ease the much overdone concerns about the banking system. One aspect of the package apparently irritated markets for a while: the ECB increased the penalty for banks to park deposits at the ECB by just 10bp from -0.3% to -0.4% and suggested that it is reluctant to go into more negative territory for rates. But that is good rather than bad news for banks. The ECB more than offset the small extra penalty for excess deposits by its cut in the refi rate, the scaling up of its asset purchases and the very generous design of its new four-year injections of long-term liquidity. The ECB has shown that it will do its utmost to prevent even a whiff of a new banking crisis and get the economy back to trend growth. Do not bet against Draghi.\u201d ECB vice president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio has published an \u201copinion piece\u201d on the ECB website, entitled \u201cIn Defence of Monetary Policy\u201d \u2013 an unusual step the day after an ECB decision. Malcolm Barr at JPMorgan Chase says he can\u2019t recall any instances of senior ECB officials putting pen to paper (as opposed to giving interviews) so soon after an ECB decision. In his view, two things in this piece stand out. One he would welcome, the other he finds thoroughly confusing. A reality check on fiscal policy and structural reform. Constancio points out that there are significant legal and political constraints on the ability of countries to use fiscal policy to stimulate growth. In his words \u201ccountries that could use fiscal space, won\u2019t; and many that would use it, shouldn\u2019t\u201d. The hint that these constraints may be at least a little unhelpful reflects the drift of opinion on this issue we have been seen of late from the leadership of the ECB. What Constancio has to say about structural reform, however, cuts somewhat against the grain. Pointing out that structural reforms tend to be deflationary in the first instance, he states: \u201cStructural reforms are essential for long-term potential growth, but it is difficult to see how they could spur growth significantly in the next two years, especially when the current problem is lack of global demand\u201d. We agree, and it is refreshing to see the ECB acknowledge this so openly. Why the bound at -0.4%? Having argued that monetary policy has had to step into the void left by other policies, Constancio argues that monetary policy has boosted growth by around two-thirds of a percentage point over the last two years. But \u201call policies have limits. In the case of the instruments, we are now using, this is particularly true of negative interest rates on our deposit facility. The reasons are more fundamental than just the effect on banks\u201d. At this point Constancio cites a recent blog by Cecchetti and Schoenholtz, before pointing out that bank returns on equity in the Euro area went up in 2015 despite negative rates. But if it is not the impact on bank profitability that sets a limit to the usefulness of negative rates, then what is the \u201cmore fundamental\u201d reason? Wall Street\u2019s late recovery overnight - the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down just 5 points after falling nearly 180 points at one stage - was one of the reasons European markets got off to a good start today. And the US futures are suggesting a bright start when trading begins in a couple of hours time, with the Dow forecast to open up around 150 points. Turning to the UK budget next Wednesday lunchtime, the HSBC analysts say that A lot has changed since chancellor George Osborne delivered his upbeat autumn statement last November. The pace of growth has slowed somewhat, nominal GDP is lower than we thought it was \u2013 thanks to revisions \u2013 and even public sector borrowing looks likely to have overshot in the current fiscal year (possibly by around GBP5bn). Complicating matters further, the UK\u2019s EU referendum looms large. While we had expected the chancellor to be forecasting a boost to revenues from pensions tax reforms, widespread media reports suggest this will no longer be the case. So, if he is to keep to his own ambitious fiscal goals, he will likely have to introduce further cuts, probably to departmental spending. With oil prices back on the rise, he may also see this as his last chance to increase fuel duties.\u201d Aside from the budget on Wednesday, the other highlight in the UK next week will be the Bank of England\u2019s monthly meeting. The decision and the meeting minutes will be released at noon on Thursday. The City is not expecting any changes to the Bank rate at 0.5% and the asset buying programme of \u00a3375bn. Investec economist Chris Hare is wondering whether we will see a more dovish tone from the monetary policy committee. Analysts at HSBC say: The MPC has been sounding remarkably dovish of late. Not as dovish as the rates market, which is now not pricing-in a rate rise until 2020, but dovish nonetheless. Indeed, since the last meeting, the survey data has been disappointing, suggesting the pace of activity in the UK could be slowing. The most recent releases of CPI inflation (February) and wage growth (December) were actually a touch higher than the BoE had expected, and oil prices in sterling terms are up 18% since the last meeting. But this is unlikely to outweigh the backdrop of a volatile global climate, slowing domestic activity and the imminent referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership. We expect all nine MPC members to vote to keep rates on hold. The US Federal Reserve is also meeting next week and will announce its policy decision at 18:00 GMT on Wednesday. Again, no change is expected. Not only has Sports Direct\u2019s founder Mike Ashley berated a parliamentary committee for trying to force him to give evidence, accusing MPs of being \u201cdeliberately antagonistic,\u201d but he has also sacked Newcastle United coach Steve McClaren (Ashley owns the football club). Oil giant BP has scrapped its long-term sponsorship of Tate Britain, in light of the recent oil price rout. Meanwhile, the Economist has looked at a kitschy animated video about China\u2019s latest five-year economic plan. \u201cEvery five years in China, man; They make a new development plan,\u201d goes the country-style ditty. You can read the piece here. Time for a look at the markets. The FTSE 100 in London is holding on to its gains, trading 1.6% higher \u2013 a gain of nearly 100 points \u2013 at 6134.35. All the main European stock markets are recording strong gains. The Dax in Frankfurt and the CAC in Paris are both 2.8% ahead while Spain\u2019s Ibex bounced 2.9%, and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB jumped more than 4%. The continued recovery in oil prices has helped, with Brent crude up 2% to $40.85 a barrel. The International Energy Agency said today that oil prices may have bottomed. Traders also seem to have concluded that yesterday\u2019s sell-off was overdone. It is worth noting that the European Central Bank sought to mitigate the impact of negative interest rates banks\u2019 balance sheets by offering to pay them for lending to companies in the eurozone. Back to the ECB. Here\u2019s a good (and fun) explanation of what happened yesterday from Jim Reid, head of global fundamental credit strategy at Deutsche Bank. I suppose if I was trying to explain yesterday\u2019s ECB meeting to a child it might go something like this. Imagine you were expecting a trip during school holidays in a caravan around the country but instead you can take 2 weeks off school, fly first class to Disneyworld, have a go in the cockpit on the way, stay at a hotel made of chocolate, and then be able to go on every ride every day without queuing and have a private play session with the real Mickey Mouse as each day draws to a close. However if the market was the same kid its reaction yesterday was \u201cdo I not get unlimited spending money, and where are we going for our summer holidays then?\u201d Given that Draghi over-delivered on most measures one can only wonder what the market reaction would have been if he had under delivered and stuck to the caravan trip. In reality he probably didn\u2019t help matters by suggesting the ECB saw no need to cut rates further early in his press conference... However to give that comment some perspective when does a central banker ever say \u201cwe\u2019re not sure if this will work so we may have to do more further down the road\u201d? So that specific reaction was a little surprising.\u201d The Royal Statistical Society also welcomed the final report of the independent review led by Bean, and called on the chancellor to implement its recommendations in next week\u2019s budget to ensure gaps in the official statistics are plugged. Mike Hughes, chair of the RSS national statistics advisory group, said: The Bean Review is a substantial and important piece of work. It shows how the UK can have the data we need to drive our economy. We now look to the chancellor to allocate the resources in next week\u2019s budget to make this happen.\u201d Sir Andrew Dilnot, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, welcomed Bean\u2019s recommendations. The Authority welcomes Sir Charles\u2019s recommendations, which set out a compelling vision for economic statistics and alongside the Authority strategy Better Statistics, Better Decisions, will help to deliver high quality economic statistics The Authority will now take time to read and consider the report and its findings.\u201d The UK\u2019s economic growth rate would be higher if its official statistics fully captured all the activity in the economy \u2013 including the digital boom, according to former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean. \u201cTake economic statistics back to the future,\u201d he says in his review of government statistics. He recommended that the Office for National Statistics set up a new research centre to come up with better ways of measuring digital activity. Bean\u2019s conclusions, published here, build on his interim findings from last year. Current statistics were designed over 50 years ago when the economy was dominated by goods, not services. It argues that the digital revolution has changed the way many businesses operate such as Amazon and Skype; given rise to new ways of exchanging and providing services (Airbnb, TaskRabbit); and has muddied the waters between work and leisure, and made it far harder to accurately measure economic output. Many businesses also operate across national borders and depend on intangible assets, which makes it harder to capture their output. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has said it had reached a preliminary agreement with the London Stock Exchange on a framework for a planned stock trading link. The two exchanges will now conduct more detailed studies into the feasibility of a Shanghai-London scheme. Over in Greece, industrial output rose 4.6% in January from a year earlier, following a 6.2% increase in December, according to the country\u2019s statistics service ELSTAT. Manufacturers boosted output by 5.% but mining output slumped 13.6%, while electricity production went up 6.8%. Here is some reaction to the UK trade data from Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, who says trade is likely to be a drag on overall economic growth again in the first quarter. January\u2019s trade figures show that the UK\u2019s economic recovery remains worryingly unbalanced. The volume of goods imports in January was 0.4% above its Q4 average, while the volume of goods exports was 1.1% below it Q4 average. Admittedly, imports have been very volatile from recently, and the 20.8% month-to-month surge in food, beverage and tobacco import volumes in January likely will be reversed in February. But we expect the trade deficit to remain bloated this year. Past experience suggests it will take at least a year for sterling\u2019s recent depreciation to boost exports. By contrast, the weaker exchange rate will boost import prices relatively swiftly, thereby worsening the trade deficit in the near-term. With global trade flows weak too and the UK\u2019s recovery likely to remain heavily dependent on consumers, we expect net trade to continue to impede the economic recovery this year.\u201d France\u2019s top public auditor has branded EDF\u2019s \u00a318bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset as potentially risky. The Cour des Comptes \u2013 the French equivalent of the UK\u2019s National Audit Office \u2013 said EDF, which is 85% state owned, should take a close look at the risks associated with the \u00a318bn project to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point. The auditor said: Even though the [Hinkley Point] deal has not been finalised, the complexity of the deal and especially the way it could impact the responsibility of EDF suffice to raise serious questions.\u201d You can read more here. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s construction industry had a bad start to the year. Output unexpectedly dropped by 0.2% in January after rising 2.1% in December, confounding expectations of an increase. However, in the fourth quarter of last year construction output grew by 0.3%, rather than falling 0.4%, according to revised figures from the statistics\u2019 office. The UK trade figures are out. They are a mixed bag: Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit shrank to \u00a33.5bn in January from a revised \u00a33.7bn in December, according to official figures. However, the shortfall with the European Union ballooned to a record high of \u00a38.1bn from \u00a37.4bn as Britain imported more from Europe. The Office for National Statistics\u2019 website has all the details. Sports Direct\u2019s founder Mike Ashley has accused MPs of being \u201cdeliberately antagonistic\u201d, claiming they are abusing parliamentary procedure by trying to force him to give evidence to a committee, my colleague Sean Farrell writes. In a letter to Iain Wright, chairman of the business, innovation and skills committee, Ashley said he was disgusted by the MPs\u2019 approach. On Wednesday, the committee warned Ashley publicly that he risked being in contempt of parliament if he failed to appear. Ashley wrote: \u201cI was disgusted to learn that you have adopted a stance that is deliberately antagonistic.\u201d He accused Wright of trying to create a \u201cmedia circus\u201d by summoning him. The letter\u2019s contents were reported in the Times on Friday and confirmed by Ashley\u2019s spokesman. The British Chambers of Commerce has cut its forecasts for UK economic growth, blaming the weaker global economy, and described Britain\u2019s performance as \u201cmediocre\u201d compared to the past. The BCC now expects GDP to rise by 2.2% this year and 2.3% in 2017k similar to growth in 2015 and down from its estimates of 2.5% for 2016 and 2017 in December. Other forecasters have made similar downgrades this year. The business lobby group\u2019s acting director general Adam Marshall said: The UK\u2019s economic performance is reasonably good when measured against our main competitors, but it\u2019s only mediocre when compared against long-term trends.\u201d The BCC urged UK chancellor George Osborne to use his budget next Wednesday to boost investment in transport and digital infrastructure. It made no mention of the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU on 23 June. The organisation\u2019s director general John Longworth quit this week after saying he wanted Britain to leave the EU, which the BCC\u2019s president said breached its neutral position on the EU. The International Energy Agency has called the bottom of the oil price rout, in a significant shift from last month\u2019s outlook. There are signs that prices might have bottomed out. For prices there may be light at the end of what has been a long, dark tunnel.\u201d The Paris-based organisation added in its monthly market report that market forces are \u201cworking their magic and higher-cost producers are cutting output.\u201d Last month, it was still predicting that crude had further to fall, arguing that the market remained \u201cawash in oil\u201d. The agency is now forecasting that oil production outside the Opec cartel will fall by 750,000 barrels a day this year \u2013 150,000 barrels a day more than it estimated last month. Output losses in Iraq and Nigeria will also underpin markets, it said, and also noted that Iran is restoring production more slowly than planned after sanctions were lifted. Oil prices are up 50% from the 12-year lows hit in January. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has gained 1.4% today to $40.62 a barrel. David Kohl, chief currency strategist and head economist Germany at Swiss private banking group Julius Baer, has concluded: The ECB delivered as much as it could do and even managed to surpass expectations. The unconvincing financial market reaction points to a diminishing power of central banks over asset prices.\u201d The FTSE 100 index is now some 90 points ahead at 6127.21, a gain of more than 90 points, underpinned by a recovery in oil prices. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC have jumped more than 2%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: Effectively wiping the slate clean after its last minute plunge on Thursday evening the FTSE surged 1.5% this morning, lifted by a recovery from Brent crude that sees the commodity back nearing its recent highs after plunging past the $40 mark following yesterday\u2019s breakdown in talks between OPEC and non-OPEC members. That left the oil and mining stocks in a healthy shade of green, the usual 2016 pre-requisite for the FTSE posting any growth. Still to come are the UK trade deficit figures, expected to widen to \u00a310.3 billion from last month\u2019s \u00a39.9 billion, something that could slightly knock the FTSE\u2019s morning confidence as the day goes on. Much like the FTSE the eurozone indices had a disastrous end to Thursday; investors fled the region after Draghi stabbed his own stimulus package in the back by suggesting that there is no more room to cut the benchmark interest rate, leaving many to question what the ECB has left in its arsenal if this round of measure doesn\u2019t work. Friday morning, however, has seen something of a rebound; the DAX and CAC both rose around 1.8% after the bell, with investors seemingly reassessing their previously schizophrenic reaction to the ECB announcement. Eurozone bond markets have stabilised after yesterday\u2019s sell-off, triggered by ECB president Mario Draghi saying he did not anticipate further rate cuts, which rapidly dampened enthusiasm for the central bank\u2019s big package of stimulus measures. The ECB sprang a surprise on markets by cutting all main interest rates and boosting its quantitative easing programme to \u20ac80bn from \u20ac60bn a month. It said it would start buying corporate debt and offered to pay banks for lending to companies in the eurozone in an attempt to boost economic growth and ward off deflation. But then Draghi sent markets into a tailspin with the comment that rates may have reached the bottom. Today, two-year German government bond yields are on course for their biggest weekly rise since early December, although ten-year German Bund yields fell. On a light day for corporate news, Old Mutual has said it would split up the company into four main units to save money. Shares in the Anglo-South African financial services group have risen 1.5% on the news. British pubs group JD Wetherspoon has seen first-half pretax profits dip nearly 4% and chairman Tim Martin complained once again that government tax policy was penalising pubs and restaurants, struggling to compete with supermarkets selling cheap booze. Watkin Jones, which builds student accommodation in the UK, is eyeing a London float. It is expected to be valued at \u00a3255m when it lists on the Alternative Investment Market later this month. The firm wants to expand into the booming private rented sector. It said it had the capacity to deliver at least 10 student halls each year. It has 31 developments with 11,300 beds in the pipeline at the moment. As we reported recently, investors have been piling into student housing and student rents are rising steadily. A record \u00a36bn was invested in purpose-built housing in the UK last year \u2013 more than in north America. Investors are attracted by the high income returns due to strong demand: students numbers are rising every year and there is a shortage of adequate accommodation. And we\u2019re off. The FTSE 100 in London has jumped nearly 1.7% to 6136.84 in the first few minutes of trading, a gain of about 100 points, no doubt helped by the rise in oil prices. Brent crude has gained 1.6% to $40.69 a barrel. There aren\u2019t any fallers on the UK benchmark index at the moment \u2013 only risers. European shares are also up strongly. Germany\u2019s Dax has risen 1.9%, France\u2019s CAC is up 1.7% and Spain\u2019s Ibex has leapt 2.1%. It\u2019s a light day for economic news. The highlight will be UK trade and construction data for January at 9.30am GMT. In December, the goods and services trade deficit shrank to \u00a32.7bn, from \u00a34bn in November. But Investec economist Chris Hare said: Despite the narrowing in the overall deficit last month\u2019s numbers do not fill us with optimism, at least for the near term. In part, that is because the turnaround was driven by a 3.6% fall in import values, while exports fell by 0.8%. Within that, services exports fared particularly poorly. Lingering effects of past rises in the pound could be playing a role here, as could the challenging global environment. Recent falls in sterling should help boost net trade going forward, but this might take a few months to come through meaningfully. He is expecting the goods and services shortfall to widen to \u00a33.2bn, with the goods deficit rising to \u00a310.3bn from \u00a39.9bn. It\u2019s the day after the European Central Bank unveiled an unprecedented package of growth-boosting measures, including rate cuts and a boost to its asset-buying programme. Stock markets initially surged and the euro plunged as ECB president Mario Draghi \u201coverdelivered\u201d \u2013 only to go into reverse when he suggested that interest rates may have hit the bottom. Analysts termed it \u201cDraghi shoots down his own bazooka\u201d (Investec) or \u201cDraghi\u2019s bazooka misfires\u201d (CMC Markets UK). After a rollercoaster ride, European stock markets ended the day lower, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 index losing 1.8% to 6036.70, its lowest close since late February. The euro dropped by a cent and a half to $1.0825 against the dollar, but then jumped more than 3% from its lows. Wall Street was flat yesterday after a volatile session. In Asia, traders were unsure how to react and stocks initially followed European shares lower but then rose across the board. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 0.5% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gained 0.8%. European markets are expected to take their cue from Asia and open higher as traders digest the ECB\u2019s measures. Stock futures suggest that the FTSE 100 could rise as much as 1.5% at the open, while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC are also seen rising by 1% or more. But following yesterday\u2019s falls, European stock markets could well finish the week lower for the first time since mid-February.",

Or maybe Freaky Friday, since many commentators were puzzled by the strong recovery today after the slump yesterday which followed ECB president Mario Draghi seemingly playing down further interest rate cuts. Part of the revival came as investors had second thoughts and decided to concentrate on the positive elements of Draghi\u2019s announcement, namely the rate cut he did unveil, the plan to buy corporate bonds and the fact the ECB will be paying banks to lend to companies in an effort to boost the flagging eurozone economy.</p> <p>On top of that, markets were buoyed by a rise in crude as the International Energy Agency said the oil price might have bottomed out and hopes grew that producers would come to an agreement to freeze output.

First, negative interest rates as a tool of monetary policy are effectively exhausted. Second, asset purchases and credit easing will do the heavy lifting of policy stimulus going forward. And third, the ECB is focused on the domestic credit channel to kick-start growth rather than lowering the euro.</p> <p>While the ECB has yet to provide details on its expanded purchase programme, our initial thoughts are that it will purchase about \u20ac4 billion in non-financial corporate bonds per month. By adding corporate bonds to its list of government, agency and covered bonds as well as asset-backed securities, the ECB is now firmly in the realm of credit easing.</p> <p>Although we acknowledge the marginal efficacy of monetary policy is declining, we disagree with the view the ECB has run out of ammunition.

This decline being driven by output losses in Iraq and Nigeria as well as Iran\u2019s post sanction impact not being a large as originally thought. Crucially, US production is now showing monthly declines which may in time lead to a greater dependence upon imports. The IEA is now forecasting that demand will increase by 1.2mmbbl/d this year.

However, forecasts can change and I do think that there is quite a lot of hope priced into the oil price on the \u201cbig freeze\u201d idea with Saudi, Russia and a few of the other more junior members of OPEC.

Its new stimulus is designed to ease the much overdone concerns about the banking system. One aspect of the package apparently irritated markets for a while: the ECB increased the penalty for banks to park deposits at the ECB by just 10bp from -0.3% to -0.4% and suggested that it is reluctant to go into more negative territory for rates. </p> <p>But that is good rather than bad news for banks. The ECB more than offset the small extra penalty for excess deposits by its cut in the refi rate, the scaling up of its asset purchases and the very generous design of its new four-year injections of long-term liquidity. The ECB has shown that it will do its utmost to prevent even a whiff of a new banking crisis and get the economy back to trend growth.

In his view, two things in this piece stand out. One he would welcome, the other he finds thoroughly confusing. </p> <ul> <li>A reality check on fiscal policy and structural reform. Constancio points out that there are significant legal and political constraints on the ability of countries to use fiscal policy to stimulate growth. In his words \u201ccountries that could use fiscal space, won\u2019t; and many that would use it, shouldn\u2019t\u201d. The hint that these constraints may be at least a little unhelpful reflects the drift of opinion on this issue we have been seen of late from the leadership of the ECB. What Constancio has to say about structural reform, however, cuts somewhat against the grain. Pointing out that structural reforms tend to be deflationary in the first instance, he states: \u201cStructural reforms are essential for long-term potential growth, but it is difficult to see how they could spur growth significantly in the next two years, especially when the current problem is lack of global demand\u201d. We agree, and it is refreshing to see the ECB acknowledge this so openly.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Why the bound at -0.4%? Having argued that monetary policy has had to step into the void left by other policies, Constancio argues that monetary policy has boosted growth by around two-thirds of a percentage point over the last two years. But \u201call policies have limits. In the case of the instruments, we are now using, this is particularly true of negative interest rates on our deposit facility. The reasons are more fundamental than just the effect on banks\u201d. At this point Constancio cites a <a href=\"http://www.moneyandbanking.com/commentary/2016/2/28/how-low-can-they-go\">recent blog by Cecchetti and Schoenholtz</a>, before pointing out that bank returns on equity in the Euro area went up in 2015 despite negative rates. But if it is not the impact on bank profitability that sets a limit to the usefulness of negative rates, then what is the \u201cmore fundamental\u201d reason?</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4bc29872d5a5d41690441bab97ba9cafa3d4689\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4bc29872d5a5d41690441bab97ba9cafa3d4689/0_0_4016_2590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Constancio at Thursday\u2019s ECB press conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Constancio at Thursday\u2019s ECB press conference</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ARNE\u00a0DEDERT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T14:20:28.192Z\">at 2.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56e2bd54e4b0cce0ec5666c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T12:46:39.296Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wall Street\u2019s late recovery overnight - the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down just 5 points after falling nearly 180 points at one stage - was one of the reasons European markets got off to a good start today.</p> <p>And the US futures are suggesting a bright start when trading begins in a couple of hours time, with the Dow forecast to open up around 150 points.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e2b528e4b0cce0ec5666a4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-11T12:10:08.551Z\">12.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turning to the UK budget next Wednesday lunchtime, the HSBC analysts say that</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A lot has changed since chancellor George Osborne delivered his upbeat autumn statement last November.

Indeed, since the last meeting, the survey data has been disappointing, suggesting the pace of activity in the UK could be slowing. </p> <p>The most recent releases of CPI inflation (February) and wage growth (December) were actually a touch higher than the BoE had expected, and oil prices in sterling terms are up 18% since the last meeting.

The euro dropped by a cent and a half to $1.0825 against the dollar, but then jumped more than 3% from its lows.</p> <p>Wall Street was flat yesterday after a volatile session.

GM\u2019s acquisition of Cruise \u201cprovides our company with a unique technology advantage that is unmatched in our industry\u201d, said GM executive vice-president Mark Reuss. \u201cWe intend to invest significantly to further grow the talent base and capabilities already established by the Cruise team.\u201d And it\u2019s also a way for the company to take a bite out of two competitors: Cruise\u2019s main product, the Cruise RP-1, was an autopilot system that could be installed in cars made by Audi (owned by Volkswagen) and Nissan (owned by Renault). General Motors said in a statement Friday it was interested in the startup because of its \u201cdeep software talent and rapid development capability to further accelerate GM\u2019s development of autonomous vehicle technology\u201d. The purchase comes as Apple, Alphabet, Uber and other tech companies are all working on self-driving car projects. Sam Altman, president of startup fund Y Combinator and an investor in the company, said that Cruise\u2019s software and hardware was far ahead of the curve and that the acquisition by GM would give it a chance to expand. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many companies in the sector,\u201d Altman pointed out. \u201cThere\u2019s a handful of others but not a lot.\u201d The technology is mostly the province of tech and auto giants from Apple to Daimler that have added automated driving to their R&amp;D projects \u2013 Cruise is one of the few startups. Cruise hadn\u2019t yet shipped commercial units by the time of the acquisition but it was well into road-testing. In January, an autopilot-to-human-pilot transition went awry in San Francisco when the pilot computer overcorrected to prevent changing lanes; the resulting fender-bender with a Nissan Leaf caused no injuries. Perhaps the largest problem with self-driving car technology is the variable condition of roadway markings that are easily readable by carbon-based drivers but less legible to their silicon counterparts. As dangerous driving jobs such as long-haul shipping inch toward greater automation, local governments have begun to \u201cbrighten up lane-striping\u201d on highways in states such as Nevada, according to that state\u2019s department of transportation. Cruise is currently legal only on California highways. \u201cThe road to new technology is a really difficult one, so I\u2019m sure there will be more accidents along the way,\u201d said Altman. \u201cBut I think we\u2019ll get to a point where it\u2019s much safer than human.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Anyone looking for an excuse to spend big on a bottle of wine should offer a silent prayer to the UK tax system. Whether it\u2019s Blue Nun or Roman\u00e9e-Conti, \u00a32.05 of every bottle of still wine sold in the UK \u2013 and \u00a32.63 for sparkling wine \u2013 goes to the exchequer in excise duty. For comparison, French wine-lovers pay just tuppence a bottle and Italians pay nothing at all. Indeed, the tax on wine is so high in the UK relative to the rest of Europe that British drinkers fork out about two thirds of all duty levied across the continent. Another way of expressing this is that the wine in a \u00a35 bottle bought in Britain costs only 47p. The rest of the price tag is excise duty, VAT, packaging and logistics and, of course, profit for the retailers. A very small proportion of your money actually goes towards pleasing your palate. The only way for true oenophiles to get more bang for their Burgundy, it follows, is to splash out on the good stuff. But what is good news for anyone looking to justify expensive tastes is bad news for Britain\u2019s small but fast-growing clutch of winemakers. Now, with wine duty projected to break through the \u00a34bn this year for the first time, Britain\u2019s vintners are calling for chancellor George Osborne to give them a shot in the arm. At Chapel Down winery in Kent, they are blending the 2015 vintage for bottling and pruning ahead of the summer, all the time with one eye on next week\u2019s budget. This is the biggest winery in the UK, with an output of about 1m bottles a year. Chapel Down has thrived here in verdant Kent, dubbed the Garden of England, where relatively mild weather and helpful topography \u2013 south-facing slopes \u2013 combine to present one of the few opportunities for viticulture in the country. Half-year profits were up this year, albeit to a relatively meagre \u00a384,000, while Chapel Down wines have won gold medals at several international awards. But chief executive Frazer Thompson thinks the company and its peers could be forging even further ahead were it not for the harsh duty regime. \u201cIt [high wine duty] does stifle innovation and put up barriers,\u201d he says. \u201cWine has been seen as something that is easy to tax because it was for wealthy people. But wine is for everybody now. The danger we face is that people drive straight past our vineyard on their way to France to buy cheap bottles.\u201d Thompson believes that if UK winemakers could convince people to buy English sparkling wine instead of champagne, \u00a3200m in sales could be repatriated. The opportunity is even greater when still wine is added to the mix. He is throwing his weight behind a call from the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) for a 2% cut to excise duty on wine when George Osborne delivers his budget next week. The trade body says a freeze on the duty imposed last year has encouraged more sales and garnered an extra \u00a3118m in tax revenue within 10 months. A cut, it believes would ease the burden on wine growers and boost the Treasury\u2019s coffers at a stroke by boosting wine consumption further. Michael Saunders, chief executive of the independent drinks distributor Bibendum PLB, agrees that the chancellor has an opportunity to take the shackles off. \u201cWine duty is holding back the UK drinks industry in a big way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wine industry supports 300,000 jobs in this country and the production of wine in the UK is exploding \u2013 creating even more investment, jobs and potential for export. As wine lovers and consumers ourselves, we want to see people being able to go out and enjoy wine at a reasonable price.\u201d But according to Chapel Down boss Frazer Thompson, the problem goes far beyond duty. While the environment secretary, Liz Truss, has showered the UK\u2019s fast-growing wine industry with praise, other parts of the establishment are not as supportive. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more embarrassing than being served Peroni and Italian wine at a British embassy but it happens,\u201d says Thompson. As well as amending the wine list at British embassies, Thompson would like to see the government put some money behind research and development, to build on the existing expertise in fruit growing and horticulture in Kent. Cool climate wines are in fashion at the moment and Thompson feels that with support from politicians, the UK could take a leading role among wine-producing nations where the sun does not always shine. He would also like to see wine duty collected at the point of sale, like VAT. That would transfer the costly administrative burden of collecting the tax from small companies such as Chapel Down to supermarket giants with a greater capacity to absorb such costs. Measures such as these, he believes, would help build on the rapid progress that is being made in English and Welsh winemaking. British vintners produced 6.3m bottles in 2014 and hope to double that to around 12m in 2020. Over the same period, they are aiming for a tenfold increase in exports to \u00a330m. In theory, there is no reason why these producers can\u2019t defy expectation by producing award-winning wines regularly. First and foremost though, this industry wants to see the chancellor extend an olive branch. Without that support, the risk is that the UK\u2019s nascent wine boom could wither on the vine.",

While the environment secretary, Liz Truss, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/07/english-wine-exports-100m-farming-growth-elizabeth-truss\">showered the UK\u2019s fast-growing wine industry with praise</a>, other parts of the establishment are not as supportive.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more embarrassing than being served Peroni and Italian wine at a British embassy but it happens,\u201d says Thompson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/03/wine_consumption-zip/giv-27167QiiQcORsEGAe\" data-alt=\"Wine consumption\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/03/wine_consumption-zip/giv-27167QiiQcORsEGAe\">Wine consumption</a> <figcaption>Wine consumption.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as amending the wine list at British embassies, Thompson would like to see the government put some money behind research and development, to build on the existing expertise in fruit growing and horticulture in Kent.</p> <p>Cool climate wines are in fashion at the moment and Thompson feels that with support from politicians, the UK could take a leading role among wine-producing nations where the sun does not always shine.</p> <p>He would also like to see wine duty collected at the point of sale, like VAT. That would transfer the costly administrative burden of collecting the tax from small companies such as Chapel Down to supermarket giants with a greater capacity to absorb such costs.</p> <p>Measures such as these, he believes, would help build on the rapid progress that is being made in English and Welsh winemaking. British vintners produced 6.3m bottles in 2014 and hope to double that to around 12m in 2020. Over the same period, they are aiming for a tenfold increase in exports to \u00a330m. In theory, there is no reason why these producers can\u2019t defy expectation by producing award-winning wines regularly.</p> <p>First and foremost though, this industry wants to see the chancellor extend an olive branch. Without that support, the risk is that the UK\u2019s nascent wine boom could wither on the vine.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct\u2019s founder, Mike Ashley, has accused MPs of being \u201cdeliberately antagonistic\u201dand abusing parliamentary procedure by trying to force him to give evidence to a committee. In a letter to Iain Wright, the chairman of the business, innovation and skills committee, Ashley said he was disgusted by the MPs\u2019 approach. On Wednesday, the committee warned Ashley publicly that he risked being in contempt of parliament if he failed to appear. Ashley wrote: \u201cI was disgusted to learn that you have adopted a stance that is deliberately antagonistic.\u201d He accused Wright of trying to create a media circus by summoning him. Wright wrote to Ashley saying the committee wanted to ask him about his company\u2019s treatment of staff, enforcement of the minimum wage and his internal review of Sports Direct\u2019s practices. The Guardian reported last year that workers at Sports Direct\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, were subjected to surveillance and lengthy searches that meant they effectively earned less than the minimum wage. Tension increased between Ashley and the committee as the billionaire retailer sought to keep Newcastle United FC in the Premier League by sacking Steve McClaren as manager and installing the former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez. Newcastle are second from bottom of the league with 10 games to go. The standoff is the second time Ashley has resisted attempts to make him appear before MPs. He declined an invitation to attend the Scottish affairs select committee last year, explaining he was busy on the dates suggested. Instead, the company sent its chairman, Keith Hellawell, who struggled to answer detailed questions. Ashley offered to meet the BIS committee privately at Shirebrook but Wright has declined, citing the \u201cselect committees\u2019 commitment to transparency\u201d. A committee spokesman said MPs would consider their response to Ashley\u2019s letter at their meeting on 15 March. In his letter, reported first in the Times, Ashley criticised the committee for failing to accept his invitation to Shirebrook. He said: \u201cYou are missing out on a genuine opportunity to gain a detailed and balanced understanding of the matters you wish to discuss. I believe you are abusing parliamentary procedure in an attempt to create a media circus at Westminster, which is not in the best interests of any of the people who work at Sports Direct.\u201d Ashley told Wright \u201call forms of the media\u201d would be welcome to attend a meeting between him and MPs at Shirebrook. Wright wrote to Ashley pointing out that he had not replied after the committee clerk offered him a number of dates to appear in Parliament. Wright said in his letter: \u201cAs you will be aware, select committees do not normally need to have recourse to our formal powers to summon witnesses in order to secure attendance; refusal to attend without good reason may be considered a contempt of the house. Wright gave Ashley, who owns 55% of Sports Direct, until 21 March to agree to a date before 1 June to be questioned by MPs. Ashley\u2019s unwillingness to go to parliament could test committees\u2019 ability to impose their will on reluctant witnesses. It is not clear how much power select committees have to force people to face questions. Rupert Murdoch and his son James gave evidence about phone hacking after the culture committee summoned them in 2011. A government green paper on parliamentary privilege in 2012 said in theory parliament could summon a person to reprimand them or order their imprisonment. But another report that year concluded committees did not have the power to compel witnesses to attend. The report, written by barristers Richard Gordon QC and Amy Street for the Constitution Society, said parliament\u2019s formal powers had not been used for hundreds of years and were unlikely to exist now. The trade union Unite has accused Sports Direct of operating \u201cDickensian practices\u201d in its treatment of workers. Ashley responded to the Guardian\u2019s reports by announcing a pay rise for staff and a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, which he would oversee personally. Ashley\u2019s moves failed to overcome disappointing trading for Sports Direct. Investor doubts about the company\u2019s governance and financial prospects meant the company was relegated from the FTSE 100 index of leading shares last week.",

To howls of derision, Miliband said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d The exchange went to the heart of Labour\u2019s problem: a large number of voters thought the recession of 2008-09 was due to the Gordon Brown government spending and borrowing too much. The polls showed that George Osborne was better trusted than Ed Balls to manage the nation\u2019s finances. If anything, Labour\u2019s credibility deficit on the economy is even bigger in the spring of 2016 than it was a year ago, and it is against that backdrop that John McDonnell has announced his determination to exercise \u201ciron discipline\u201d over day-to-day government spending while being prepared to borrow for investment. There is nothing wildly radical about this approach. The International Monetary Fund has been advising countries that they can boost growth by higher spending on infrastructure projects. So has the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. With interest rates at historically low levels, both the IMF and the OECD see the opportunity for governments to give a fillip to a flagging global economy and improve long-term growth prospects by raising investment spending. The idea, going all the way back to John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, is that there will be a knock-on effect through the economy, as the workers employed to build new roads or railways spend their wages and salaries. These so-called multiplier effects tend to be larger when, as now, there is a big backlog of infrastructure work that needs to be done and when there is little scope to stimulate activity through lower interest rates. It is not the case that McDonnell would inevitably end up borrowing billions more and make the UK\u2019s debt situation worse: wisely managed, the extra investment would more than pay for itself. The other half of McDonnell\u2019s plan involves balancing current spending over a five-year period. This doesn\u2019t mean that McDonnell is buying into austerity: it simply means that any increase in the day-to-day running costs of government would have to be matched by increases in taxes. Looking ahead, McDonnell has three issues to address. The first is that some current spending \u2013 increasing the pay of teachers, for example \u2013 could be classified as investment rather than current spending. The second is that he has to win an argument with Osborne, whose plans involve running an overall surplus on both current and investment spending by the end of the parliament. The third is to couch his argument in language that resonates with voters. Miliband\u2019s response to his questioner should have been to turn the tables and ask whether he had a mortgage.

The trial generated more than 22 tonnes of food \u2013 the equivalent of 50,000 meals. Now Tesco and FareShare want to join forces with 5,000 charities and community groups which would receive free surplus food. FareShare and the tech company FoodCloud link stores with charities that provide meals to vulnerable people, including the homeless, substance addicts, children and the elderly. Tesco generates more than 50,000 tonnes of food waste a year within its stores \u2013 about 1% of the food it handles \u2013 and it estimates that more than 30,000 tonnes of that is edible. It is the only UK retailer to publish details of the amount of waste food it generates. Dave Lewis, the chief executive, said tackling waste was a priority. The grocer\u2019s attempts to tackle the food waste problem come as Lewis tries to revive the supermarket\u2019s image, which has been tarnished by a \u00a3263m accounting scandal and criticism about its service as well as its treatment of suppliers. Lewis said: \u201cThis is not to get people to like us again. This is about being a responsible business. Customers today want to know businesses where they choose to shop at are responsible. We have an opportunity, given our size and scale, to make massive a contributions to the communities in which we operate in, and why wouldn\u2019t we do that?\u201d The issue of food waste has risen up the agenda after being highlighted by celebrity chefs such as Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. MPs have also discussed whether legislation to ban the disposal of edible food by retailers should be introduced after a ban was imposed in France. Tesco\u2019s wonky veg launch comes after Asda and Morrisons announced similar ranges in recent weeks. Asda is selling boxes of in-season vegetables and salad ingredients 30% cheaper than its standard lines. In December, Morrisons reported brisk sales of wonky potatoes and carrots after a trial in in Yorkshire and the north-east. Most of the supermarkets have been distributing food left over at their warehouses to charities for several years. Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks &amp; Spencer have schemes under which they send waste from stores to charities, but the vast majority of food waste from stores is sent for use as animal feed or to be loaded into anaerobic digestion energy plants. Lewis said: \u201cI think the industry should work together on this. I don\u2019t see it as a source of competitive advantage.\u201d Tesco would share its systems with other retailers, he added, and FareShare hoped to sign up another major supermarket to the scheme by the end of the year. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is just a trend. Demand won\u2019t go away and no business wants to waste anything,\u201d Lewis added. Just over 1% of food wasted in the UK comes from stores, amounting to about 200,000 tonnes, according to figures published this year by the government-backed Waste Resources Action Programme. Of the estimated 15m tonnes of food disposed of annually in the UK , more than half is thrown away by households.",

      "bodyText": "The pro-Brexit chairman of the pub chain JD Wetherspoon has accused David Cameron of using \u201cPaisleyite language\u201d to describe the possible impact of the leaving the EU. Tim Martin, who grew up in Northern Ireland, criticised the prime minister for leading the remain campaign and using divisive, sectarian language reminiscent of the rhetoric of the late Ian Paisley, the former leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist party. Martin accused the pro-EU camp of using insults and scare tactics to belittle their opponents, and said Cameron should be a neutral figure instead of leading the remain campaign. He also accused pro-EU business leaders of acting like sheep, peddling a line fed to them by Downing Street, and said they should be ashamed of their behaviour. Martin said business executives and politicians in favour of staying in the EU were a group of highly educated men in late middle age who were prepared to sacrifice democracy to be part of an elite European club. \u201cCameron is a highly educated guy and he understands the various issues but he is arguing in a tribal way,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up in Northern Ireland and it\u2019s Paisleyite language being used to describe the effects of not being in the EU: \u2018We will lose 3m jobs and the people who aren\u2019t in it are little Englanders\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s almost sectarian, the language. He is using personal insults, whereas to me he should be like a judge helping a jury to weigh up the evidence.\u201d Martin, who founded the FTSE 250 pub chain in 1979, said Britain would be better off out of the EU in the long run and dismissed fears of a short-term shock to the economy if there was a vote to leave. He argued for leaving the EU in an article in the most recent edition of Wetherspoon News, available in the company\u2019s pubs. Most business leaders who have expressed an opinion have said Britain should stay in the EU. Bosses of about a third of FTSE 100 companies wrote a letter last month arguing that leaving the EU would threaten jobs, deter investment and endanger the economy. Martin said: \u201cI don\u2019t think much of people being hauled into 10 Downing Street ... and then signing a letter. They should be ashamed of themselves. I haven\u2019t seen one of them write an article themselves in the way I have. \u201cA lot of people on most boards are sheep and they stay there four or five years and they write their reports in business jargon and they aren\u2019t independent business thinkers. Most of them are delicate orchids who won\u2019t say anything.\u201d He said British businesses would benefit from leaving the EU in the long run through increased democratic accountability. As the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy, the UK would not suffer any economic damage, he said.",

      "bodyText": "A modest narrowing of Britain\u2019s trade gap coupled with a slight weakening in the construction sector has provided George Osborne with mixed economic news before next week\u2019s budget. The Office for National Statistics said the UK\u2019s trade deficit in goods and services with the rest of the world had eased back from an upwardly revised \u00a33.7bn to \u00a33.5bn between December 2015 and January 2016. During the same period, the output of the construction industry fell by 0.2%, with the ONS also reporting that activity in the fourth quarter of 2015 was less weak than originally believed. Official figures showed the UK ran a deficit of \u00a310.3bn in goods in January, partly offset by a \u00a36.8bn surplus in services. The ONS said the improvement in January \u2013 the latest month for which figures are available \u2013 had been the result of oil and so-called \u201cerratics\u201d: items such as precious stones and aircraft for which there is no settled pattern for imports and exports. Excluding oil and erratics, the ONS said the deficit had widened by 0.5% in January. Over the three months to January \u2013 a better guide to the underlying picture than one month\u2019s data \u2013 the deficit on goods and services stood at \u00a311.8bn, an increase of \u00a33.5bn on the previous quarter. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon, said Britain\u2019s economy remained unbalanced. \u201cThe overall trade deficit was \u00a33.5bn in January, worse than the consensus, \u00a33.0bn. December\u2019s deficit was also revised much larger, to \u00a33.7bn from \u00a32.7bn.\u201d For the construction sector, the ONS said there had been a decrease in new building work offset by an increase in repair and maintenance. Public sector housing and infrastructure saw the biggest falls in activity. The ONS said new data showed that construction output in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 0.3% down on the third quarter. That compared with an earlier estimate of a 0.4% fall. Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said: \u201cThe UK construction sector suffered a disappointing start to the year, adding to a downbeat flow of data on the health of the economy so far this year. The data follow survey evidence showing growth slowing sharply in February amid heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\u201d",
