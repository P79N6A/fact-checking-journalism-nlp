      "bodyText": "It is a poor show that Sharon White, head of the communications regulator Ofcom, is reduced to writing columns in the FT to try to block Three\u2019s takeover of O2. The blame lies with European legislation, which dictates that Brussels decides on deals between companies whose parents have big operations in more than one EU country, as both Three and O2 do. Still, at least White is doing her best to crank up the pressure on the EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager. White signalled her opposition to the \u00a310bn deal in a speech last October and now she has slammed her cards on the table. She is right to do so: a combination of Three and O2, creating a new market leader and reducing the number of UK networks from four to three, would damage competition and leave consumers poorer. Ah, the network operators always plead in these circumstances, the investment demands in the telecoms industry are so heavy that they can only be undertaken by big companies that can write large cheques. White examined this argument and found no supporting evidence. Mobile companies have maintained healthy cashflow margins above 12% in the UK even while rolling out 4G technology. \u201cCompetition, not consolidation, has driven investment,\u201d as she puts it. What\u2019s more, fewer competitors usually means higher prices for customers. In Austria, which underwent a similar four-to-three consolidation, mobile prices have risen 15%, with light users \u2013 often the young and the old \u2013 suffering steeper increases. The Austrian experiment is one the UK would happily live without, especially as Three, with its all-you-can-eat data packages, has demonstrably added to biodiversity in the UK telecoms jungle. Vestager, thankfully, may be sympathetic to White\u2019s views. She threw so many obstacles in front of a four-to-three consolidation in her homeland of Denmark that the proposed deal collapsed. But there are still reasons to worry. First, Denmark may be the exception: four-to-three consolidation has also been allowed in Germany and Ireland. Second, Ofcom is concerned that the European telecoms framework leaves national regulators under-equipped to deal with emerging oligopolies. White, in that same speech last October, joined European counterparts in pleading for \u201cthe full range of tools to do the job\u201d \u2013 a cry as yet unanswered. If Three/02 is allowed to happen it would be a slap in the face for Ofcom and a severe blow to the credibility of UK telecoms regulation. No wonder White is deploying unorthodox tactics instead of relying on backroom chats in Brussels. The sooner Vestager says no to Three/02 the better. Breaking up might be hard to do at BT BT has no such worries on the mobile front. Its purchase of EE was completed last week and, by way of celebration, BT\u2019s shares closed within pennies of 500p on Monday, boosted also by a strong set of third-quarter numbers. It would have been the highest price for the shares since those gung-ho dotcom days of 2001, just before BT\u2019s last adventure in mobile ended with the sale of Cellnet to reduce debt. In the circumstances, BT can\u2019t be surprised that it is regarded in some quarters as recreating a hideous monopoly. Break it up, comes the cry, and Grant Shapps, former Tory party chairman, has persuaded 120 MPs to support forced separation of Openreach, the bit of BT that owns and manages the copper-and-fibre networks. Liberating Openreach is one decision Ofcom can make (it will opine later this month) but the Shapps lobby should be careful what it wishes for. An independent Openreach would still be a dominant supplier of wholesale broadband connections and its economic incentives to invest in better infrastructure would not increase one jot on day one. Indeed, an independent Openreach, which would presumably be burdened with a proportionate share of BT\u2019s pension liabilities, might try to milk profits over time.

    "webTitle": "Rolls-Royce wins $2.7bn aircraft engine order from Norwegian", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has won a significant boost after budget airline Norwegian agreed a $2.7bn (\u00a31.9bn) deal to buy engines from the beleaguered company. Rolls will provide Trent 1000 engines for 19 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft that Norwegian has ordered. The order is the firm\u2019s biggest since Warren East became chief executive last July. It comes just less than two weeks before Rolls\u2019s annual results, when East is expected to provide details about his plan to revitalise the struggling company. Rolls-Royce has issued five profit warnings in less than two years, and its share price has fallen by almost half since last April. The Derby-based group has blamed the profit warnings on a number of factors, including falling demand for corporate jets and the sharp fall in the price of oil, which has hurt customers in the energy industry. The pressure on the company has been increased by ValueAct, an activist investor based in California, building a 10% holding in Rolls and pushing for a seat on the board. Rolls is also mired in a Serious Fraud Office investigation about bribery allegations in China, Indonesia and other parts of the world. Shares in Rolls were flat at 555p after the Norwegian deal was announced. Rolls will also service Norwegian\u2019s engines as part of the agreement. Eric Schulz, president of civil aerospace at Rolls, said: \u201cThis is another significant decision in favour of the Trent 1000, an engine that delivers exceptional economics and performance.\u201d Rolls is competing with US rival General Electric to provide engines for the 787 Dreamliner, which went into service in 2011. Bj\u00f8rn Kjos, chief executive of Norwegian, said: \u201cThis decision further develops our relationship with Rolls-Royce and we look forward to operating aircraft powered by the latest version of the Trent 1000, which sets new standards of performance.\u201d Analysts said the deal highlighted the strength of Rolls in the wide-bodied market, which includes planes that typically hold 250 people or more and focus on long-haul travel. Andy Chambers, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said: \u201cThis follows hot on the heels of last week\u2019s announcement by Airbus that Iran intends to order 73 wide-body aircraft, including 18 A330-900neos and 16 A350-1000s powered by Rolls-Royce Trent engines. \u201cWith the potential to power the 12 A380s and 27 A330ceos also selected, [the Iran order] could turn out to be one of Rolls-Royce\u2019s most significant orders. \u201cBoth developments continue to highlight Rolls-Royce\u2019s strong market position in the wide-body market, with the Iran selection a major support for the A330 and A380 programmes.\u201d Despite its problems, Rolls is on course to claim a 50% share of the wide-bodied market by 2020, up from 30% at present. However, orders for wide-bodied aircraft have slowed, while the narrow-bodied market is booming thanks to the demand for the A320neo and the Boeing 737 Max. Rolls pulled out of the narrow-bodied market in order to focus on larger planes. This has hurt the company\u2019s sales volumes, leaving its factories short of work. East is attempting to cut costs by up to \u00a3200m a year to get the company back on track. This includes as shakeup of the senior management team. The level of concern about the future of Rolls was underlined in December when it emerged the government has drawn up contingency plans to nationalise its nuclear submarine business or force it to merge with defence manufacturer BAE Systems in the event the company\u2019s performance worsens.",

      "bodyText": "The founder of easyJet has opened a discount food store that is selling everyday groceries for 25p each. Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has launched easyFoodstore in an attempt to take advantage of the fast-growing discount market in the UK, which is led by Aldi and Lidl. The venture could eventually be another threat to the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket chains \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. They are already battling dramatic changes in shopping habits as families turn away from the weekly trip to a supermarket in favour of buying food online, in convenience stores and with the discounters. The supermarket chains also face the threat of Amazon expanding into groceries in the UK. The pilot easyFoodstore has opened in Park Royal in north-west London. It will sell items for 25p each in February as an introductory offer. The retailer\u2019s slogan is \u201cNo expensive brands. Just food honestly priced.\u201d Haji-Ioannou, who has run food initiatives through a charitable organisation in Greece and Cyprus, said: \u201cThis is another way the easy brand can serve the less well-off. Given my experience in distributing food for free in Greece and Cyprus, this is a more commercial attempt to sell basic food for 25p per item to those unwaged or low waged living around Park Royal.\u201d Haji-Ioannou first announced plans to open a discount food store almost three years ago in August 2013. A mock easyFoodstore was built in Croydon a year later, but the tycoon\u2019s plans then appeared to stall, with no shops opening for customers until now. EasyFoodstore will sell a range of grocery items including pasta, biscuits and beans. However, the list of initial products does not include fresh meat or fruit and vegetables. When he first announced the idea, Haji-Ioannou said he had been inspired to launch easyFoodstore by the widespread use of food banks. \u201cI have a feeling that there is a gap in the food retail market \u2013 a niche below some of the current budget operators such as Aldi and Lidl,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that a commercially viable venture offering affordable food will help many people in need as well as producing a viable return for the capital employed.\u201d Haji-Ioannou and his family still own about 35% of easyJet and are the biggest shareholders. He has already expanded the \u201ceasy\u201d brand into a string of other industries, creating easyCar, easyHotel, easyGym and easyProperty. Since creating the budget airline he has had mixed success. EasyBus and easyHotel have generated profits, but easyCinema was a failure and easyInternetcafe lost more than \u00a3100m.",

It will sell items for 25p each in February as an introductory offer. The retailer\u2019s slogan is \u201cNo expensive brands. Just food honestly priced.\u201d<br></p> <p>Haji-Ioannou, who has run food initiatives through a charitable organisation in Greece and Cyprus, said: \u201cThis is another way the easy brand can serve the less well-off. Given my experience in distributing food for free in Greece and Cyprus, this is a more commercial attempt to sell basic food for 25p per item to those unwaged or low waged living around Park Royal.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/04/easygroup-budget-supermarket-stelios-haji-ioannou\">EasyGroup hopes to take on Aldi et al with budget supermarket plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Haji-Ioannou first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/04/easygroup-budget-supermarket-stelios-haji-ioannou\">announced plans to open a discount food store</a> almost three years ago in August 2013.

      "bodyText": "A bill requiring states to obtain information about the true ownership of all corporations will be introduced in Congress on Thursday, according to Carolyn Maloney, a congresswoman from New York. The lawmaker is looking to cut down on the creation of anonymously owned companies that often serve as ways to funnel \u201csuspect\u201d money into the US. If the states are not able to obtain information about the ownership of corporations, the US Treasury Department will have to step in and do say, Maloney said on Monday. Her announcement comes the morning after 60 Minutes aired footage filmed by Global Witness, an anti-corruption organization, revealing New York lawyers providing advice on how to ease flow of \u201cgrey\u201d money into the US. The film helps demonstrate how US-based lawyers often help create shell companies to hide \u201csuspect money\u201d, said Gillian Caldwell, CEO of Global Witness. An undercover activist posing as an adviser to an African mining minister filmed meetings with 13 US law firms. Just one lawyer declined to advise him and would not recommend any other law firms for the \u201cadviser\u201d to approach. The other 12 lawyers were caught on camera advising how such shell companies could be used to purchase a Manhattan brownstone, a private jet and a luxury yacht \u2013 without having to disclose the actual owner was a supposed African minister. \u201cNone of the lawyers we met with took us on as clients and none of them actually moved any money for us. None of them broke the law. In fact, that\u2019s exactly the point. They showed us what is wrong with the law and what we need to change,\u201d Caldwell explained. \u201cThey revealed in stark terms how the US legal system is wide open to access and exploitation by people who are up to no good.\u201d Without these shell companies, these \u201ccriminals\u201d would not be able to enjoy their \u201cloot\u201d, Caldwell said. \u201cAnonymous companies are like getaway cars for the criminal and the corrupt. And it\u2019s time to take away the keys.\u201d Maloney called the Global Witness investigation \u201cexplosive\u201d. \u201cI was astonished at the 12 New York law firms that not only were they listening, [but] they were suggesting new ways to move suspect money into the US to avoid detection. This is unacceptable, criminal and scandalous and it has to stop,\u201d she said. This will be the third time Maloney has introduced her bill. She would not say how many supporters her bill has so far but did say she sent a \u201cDear colleague\u201d letter to other members of Congress asking for their support. Maloney also requested that the House financial services committee, on which she sits, hold a hearing on the issue. \u201cI have a great respect for anything that passes the United States Congress,\u201d she laughed. \u201cTo get that fragile flower of consensus and the majority of votes, it takes a lot of work to make that happen.\u201d The congresswoman told reporters that she is now turning her full attention to making this bill happen. \u201cWe have a real chance of getting something done in this Congress on this legislation,\u201d she said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "February has got off to a fairly downbeat start for stock markets. More underwhelming manufacturing data - from China to Europe to the US - has cast a further shadow over the prospects for the global economy. The Chinese disappointment in particular has helped send crude oil prices sliding again, along with growing doubts about any early Opec agreement to cut production and tackle the supply glut. Brent is currently down 4.5% at $34.36 a barrel. But markets have come off their worst levels, helped by a better than expected start on Wall Street. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: Any hope that equity markets would start February with a spring in their step has been scuppered as crude oil prices have resumed their downward trajectory. Last week\u2019s optimism that a deal to curtail output would be struck between Russia and Saudi Arabia has come to nothing, whilst the price weakness has been further exacerbated by the release of worse than expected manufacturing PMI data from China and ISM manufacturing readings from the US in the last few hours. That said, the degree of weakness in equity markets has been rather measured, the FTSE-100 is closing above 6,000 and the renewed intervention we\u2019ve seen by central banks does seem to be helping limit downside pressures. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 23.69 points or 0.39% at 6060.10 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.41% to 9757.88 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.56% lower at 4392.33 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dropped 0.92% to 18,485.95 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.31% down at 8788.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.78% to 557.16 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 93 points or 0.57%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. ECB president Mario Draghi has repeated his view that risks to the global economy had increased in the past few weeks, with the global market turmoil, uncertainty in emerging markets and lowered inflation expectations. Echoing his comments after the bank\u2019s January meeting he suggested there would be more stimulus measures in March: At our last meeting in January we judged that it will be necessary to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our next monetary policy meeting in early March, when the new staff macroeconomic projections become available. In a speech to the European parliament he also called for the UK to remain part of the EU. He said: There is still political uncertainty surrounding the European project. This is true in the broader context of our Union. A solution that would anchor the United Kingdom firmly within the EU while allowing the euro area to integrate further would boost confidence.... Citizens and markets are too often unsure about our capacity to act jointly in a spirit of common responsibility. We should prove them wrong. Here are Markit\u2019s rankings of various countries\u2019 purchasing managers\u2019 indices: Over in Greece and farmers meeting in congregation in the centre of the country have announced that they will not back down nor accept prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 olive branch of a meeting - at least until the general strike this Thursday when Tsipras conveniently will be in London. Helena Smith writes: Farmers, now leading the wave of social discontent against unpopular EU/IMF dictated reforms, appear poised to declare all out war, said protestor Aris Andris in Tempi where the meeting is taking place. \u201cThis is not a struggle we are going to give up because this is about our survival,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now telling everyone that cities everywhere are going to experience unprecedented things.\u2019\u201d Analysts are saying the economy stands to suffer gravely if tractor convoys continue to block roads. The ISM report is here, and it includes some mixed responses from the companies surveyed: \u201cThe oil and gas sector continues to be challenged by low oil and gas prices. Risk of suppliers filing for bankruptcy and reducing their workforce is becoming an increasing risk. Our company workforce is also declining.\u201d (Petroleum &amp; Coal Products) \u201cBusiness this month [is] better than last month and better than this period last year. Reduced oil and basic chemical prices providing favorable margin comparisons.\u201d (Chemical Products) \u201cWe are a bit slower, but staying busy.\u201d (Fabricated Metal Products) \u201cBusiness is still strong, but slowing.\u201d (Transportation Equipment) \u201c2016 starting off with strong orders.\u201d (Primary Metals) \u201cMarket is sluggish to start the year.\u201d (Wood Products) \u201cOverall demand is higher than expected for post-holiday season.\u201d (Plastics &amp; Rubber Products) \u201cMuch worldwide macroeconomic uncertainty affecting our business. Business confidence seems low.\u201d (Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products) The ISM survey could indicate that Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers could be weaker than expected, said James Knightley at ING Bank: US manufacturing ISM for January is a bit weaker than expected at 48.2...and marks the fourth straight sub-50 (contraction territory) outcome. However, the details are more encouraging with both production and new orders moving back above 50. The main weakness was in the employment component, which fell to 45.9 from 48.0 \u2013 the worst outcome since June 2009. This suggests that the sector will be a drag on overall employment growth in Friday\u2019s payrolls report and indicates the consensus is being a little optimistic in thinking that US manufacturing employment is only going to fall 2,000. Indeed, we were seeing manufacturing employment fall by around 25-50,000 per month in 2009 when the ISM employment component was last at these sorts of levels. As a result, the overall payrolls consensus figure for Friday at 190,000 is looking a bit high too. It\u2019s a similar tale for US manufacturing from the ISM survey. Its manufacturing activity index came in at 48.2 in January, up from 48 in December but lower than forecasts of up to 48.5. But a reminder than any reading below 50 signals contraction, and this is the fourth month this has happened. The employment index at 45.9 was well below expectations of a reading of 48 and marks the lowest level since June 2009. This is not a good sign ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers due on Friday. US manufacturing in January was stronger than the previous month but less than initial expectations, according to a new survey. The Markit manufacturing sector final PMI was 52.4 compared to expectations of a reading of 52.7, the same as the initial December level. The final reading for December was 51.2. Another survey, the ISM manufacturing index, is due shortly. Will oil falling again after the disappointing Chinese manufacturing data and diminishing hopes of Opec production cuts, Wall Street has followed other global markets lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 135 points or 0.8% in early trading , while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.4% lower and Nasdaq has fallen 0.6%. Meanwhile Brent is down more than 2% at $35.19 a barrel. And here is some news on a UK bid battle. David Hellier reports: Sainsbury\u2019s has won its three-month courtship of Home Retail Group, with a \u00a31.3bn takeover of the Argos owner expected to be announced as early as Tuesday, according to leading investors in both groups. Sainsbury\u2019s had its first approach for Home Retail snubbed in November at a price believed to be around \u00a31bn. But it returned to the pursuit of its target shortly after the New Year and now needs to put up a formal offer before 5pm tomorrow or ask for an extension from the City\u2019s Takeover Panel, which regulates bids and deals. Full story: Back in the UK, and pharmacy chain Boots is cutting up to 350 jobs as part of a cost reduction programme. Graham Ruddick reports: This is the second round of job cuts at Boots in the last seven months, after an announcement in June last year that the company would cut 700 jobs in offices around the UK. In the latest round of redundancies, the company plans to cut between 300 and 350 assistant store managers at its biggest stores. Boots is now part of Walgreens Boots Alliance, one of the biggest retailers in the world, after the merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots in 2014. The company employs 60,000 people in the UK and Stefano Pessina, the chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, has pledged that Boots will remain committed to the UK despite the mega-merger. Full story here: US consumers did not rush out to spend any of the cash they saved from lower fuel prices, according to official figures. Consumer spending in December was unchanged after a 0.5% increase in the previous month, itself revised up from an initial 0.3% gain. The core PCE price index - the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure - rose 1.4% year on year, well short of the central bank\u2019s inflation target of 2%. Ahead of the figures, Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: Last weeks Fed statement also saw the omission of a line about policymakers being reasonably confident that inflation will rise to 2% in the medium term, due to the sharp declines seen in oil prices in the last few weeks. The PCE inflation numbers, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation targeting measure, while not necessarily susceptible to these types of moves in energy prices have started to track lower, and if today\u2019s number drops back from last month\u2019s 1.3%, then it will become increasingly difficult for Fed officials to argue with any degree of credibility that we can expect to see anywhere near three of four rate rises this year, A reminder of why markets are worrying about China again: Over in Wall Street, shares in social network Twitter have jumped by up to 8% in pre-market trading. There\u2019s some chatter that venture capitalist Mark Andreessen and private equity firm Silver Lake have considered an offer for Twitter, but it all looks a bit flaky. At $17 per share, Twitter has lost more than half its value since it floated in late 2013. Indeed, the stock has lost around 40% in the last three months, as it struggles to compete with Facebook, expand its user base and grow revenue as fast as Wall Street would like. Back in the markets, budget airline Ryanair is defying today\u2019s selloff. Its shares are up 5% so far today, after announcing a \u20ac800m share buyback. It is also slashing prices by 6%, in response to cheaper oil prices and a drop in demand following the Paris terror attacks. Over in Greece escalating protests have put the leftist-led government of Alexis Tsipras increasingly on the defensive as international creditors launch another round of talks in the crisis-hit country. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens. In a week that will see farmers, civil servants, doctors, lawyers, engineers, pharmacists and other freelance professionals take to the streets, the Greek prime minister is feeling the heat as never before. With farmers blocking key junctions across the country and pledging to increase tractor roadblocks if the government doesn\u2019t rescind controversial tax and pension reforms, creditor mission chiefs launched a new round of talks in Athens this morning amid renewed fears that Greece is heading for political and social chaos. The conservative daily Kathimerini set the mood, in an editorial declaring: \u201cthe country appears to be on the brink of a social explosion.\u201d Lenders, led by the International Monetary Fund, have already signaled that draft pension reforms put forward by the government are insufficient with the Washington-based body pushing for further cuts of up to 15% in pensions. Tsipras, whose political future could rest on measures taken, has adamantly ruled out further cuts suggesting that social security contributions be increased instead \u2013 a move creditors argue would be yet another corrosive blow to the business sector. Concerns that the Syriza-dominated coalition, in power with a mere majority of three, will be able to survive the storm mounted at the weekend when irate farmers confronted ministers and Syriza party MPS as they returned to their constituencies. That in turn has raised the pressure on parliamentarians to throw their weight behind the legislation with a growing number (insiders speak of as many as ten) indicating that they may not support the reforms when they are brought to the 300-seat House for a vote. Analysts are increasingly talking of the spectre of early elections \u2013 a prospect seen as potentially disastrous for the debt-stricken economy. No one is now expecting the review to be ended any time soon. The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, giving a first hint of the timeline, said he did not think it would be completed until the end of March at the earliest \u2013 further delaying what the government regards as the critical debate on debt relief. What is certain is a problem-strewn path lies ahead with emotions climbing \u2013 some would say dangerously - in a week that will climax when the country is brought to a halt with a general strike on Thursday. Four hours into the trading months, and European stock markest are mostly in the red. The slowdown in eurozone factory growth, following the latest contraction in China, have given investors little reason for optimism. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx has helpfully rounded up the data: After appearing to have shrugged off China\u2019s dire data at the open, the European markets soon abandoned their gains, the situation exacerbated by a mixed showing from the region\u2019s own manufacturing figures. Despite managing a 19-month high PMI of 52.9 (against the 51.9 forecast), the UK\u2019s manufacturing picture wasn\u2019t as clear cut as that number suggests; export orders continued to fall, whilst the worrying trend of companies cutting their staffing levels persisted. Those factors, and the generally unconvinced tone from analysts, took the spark out of what initially looked like a decent number, leaving the FTSE to tumble into the red as Monday progressed. Things were even messier over in the Eurozone. An 8 month manufacturing high for Spain (coming a week after its robust GDP data) and a 4 month high for Italy were joined by 3 and 5 month lows for Germany and France respectively, the slowdown seen by those powerhouses causing the region-wide figure to drop from 53.2 to 52.3 month-on-month. Money continues to pour into eurozone government bonds this morning. The news that eurozone factories cut prices again last month is fuelling bets that the European Central Bank will announce more stimulus measures at its March meeting. Bonds are also in demand after the Bank of Japan announced negative interest rates last Friday. The yield (effectively the interest rate) on German bonds has slumped to fresh record lows; five-year German debt is now yielding minus 0.318%, meaning investors are paying more than the face value of the bonds. That\u2019s also below the ECB deposit rate of -0.3%, meaning the central bank cannot actually buy them through its QE programme. Traders are betting that the deposit rate could fall again soon. Japanese bonds have also been driven to fresh highs today, sending their yields tumbling. We shouldn\u2019t get carried away by the increase in UK factory activity last month, warns Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation. She points out that firms in the energy sector are under particular pressure: \u201cAt face value, today\u2019s data got 2016 off to an encouraging start with activity levels improving a little on the back of a pickup in new orders, with domestic demand compensating for, once again, lacklustre export orders. But, looking beyond the headline there\u2019s conflicting signals, with growth drivers narrower in terms of sub-sector and size, and manufacturing posting job losses for the fourth time in the last six months. Britain\u2019s factories have enjoyed a fairly solid start to the year. The UK manufacturing PMI, just released, showed that activity rose to a three month high of 52.9 in January, up from 51.9. That beats expectations. But it\u2019s a slightly mixed picture --although output hit 19-month high, new export orders fell, leaving companies reliant on domestic demand. They also cut their staffing levels, in a worrying sign for future employment figures. In addition, UK firms reported that their raw materials were cheaper, allowing them to cut prices - adding to deflationary pressures. Markit explains: The ongoing weakness in global commodity prices led to a further substantial reduction in manufacturers\u2019 average purchasing costs during January. Average input prices fell at the fastest rate for four months and to one of the greatest extents during the 24-year survey history. There were reports of lower prices for chemicals, metals, oil and plastics. Part of the reduction in raw material costs was passed on to clients in the form of decreased factory gate prices, the fifth reduction in as many months. The rate of output charge deflation remained mild. It\u2019s official: growth across Europe\u2019s factory sector slowed last month. This morning\u2019s surveys show that the eurozone manufacturing sector expanded at a slower pace. The headline PMI dipped to 52.3 in January, down from 53.2 in December Firms reported that output, new orders and new export business all grew at a slower pace in January, suggesting the sector weakened. The survey also found that firms cut prices for the fifth month running, and at the sharpest rate since January 2015. That\u2019s good news for consumers, but not for central bankers who are trying to get inflation up. \uf0a7Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said: \u201cThe eurozone\u2019s manufacturing economy missed a beat at the start of the year. Having accelerated for three straight months, the rate of growth slipped from the 20-month high attained at the end of 2015. Growth of order books, exports and output all slowed. \u201cIf the slowdown in business activity wasn\u2019t enough to worry policymakers, prices charged by producers fell at the fastest rate for a year to spur further concern about deflation becoming ingrained. Greece\u2019s factory also stagnated last month: Germany\u2019s factory sector made an unspectacular start to 2016. The German manufacturing PMI came in at 52.3, down from 53.2 in December, indicating growth cooled at the start of 2016. Markit reports that output and new orders increased at weaker rates. The increase in new business was the least marked in four months. Weaker demand from export markets was one of the reasons for the slowdown in total new business. However, some panellists reported that the weak euro and improved demand from the US helped secure higher new export orders. January was another month of stagnation in the French factory sector. Its manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.0 - the cut-off point between growth and expansion, down from 51.4 in December. Growth in Italy\u2019s factory sector slowed, last month, with the PMI dipping to 53.2 to 54.9. An unofficial measure of Chinese factory output has confirmed that the sector shrank again last month. The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI showed a sharper downturn, coming in at 48.4, up from 48.2 in December. That\u2019s worse than the official PMI reading of 49.4 (see earlier post), showing a faster downturn. Caixin reported that: Operating conditions continue to deteriorate at a modest pace Output and employment both contract at faster rates... ...but new orders decline at softest pace in seven months Dr. He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group, says Beijing needs to steer the economy closely: \u201cThe government needs to watch economic trends closely and proactively make fine adjustments to prevent a hard landing. It also needs to push ahead with existing reform measures to strengthen market confidence and to signal its intentions clearly.\u201d Good news! Spain\u2019s factories grew at a faster pace last month, outperforming their rivals in China. The Spanish manufacturing PMI, which measures activity across the sector, rose to 55.4 last month, up from 53. That shows faster growth, and beats forecasts: Encouragingly, firms reported that new business rose at the fastest pace since February 2007. That pushed up the backlogs of work, and meant that the rate of job creation quickened to the fastest in five months. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, says: \u201cThe Spanish manufacturing sector shrugged off uncertainty surrounding the make-up of the next government in January, posting a strong start to 2016. One key highlight was the fastest rise in new business since prior to the economic crisis, while efforts to increase stock holdings point to confidence in the near-term outlook for orders. European stock markets have begun February cautiously. The FTSE 100 has dipped by 3 points, while the German DAX is down 16 points or 0.2%. BP is leading the fallers in London, down 1%. It is expected to report a big slump in profits tomorrow, partly due to the fall in the oil price: Today\u2019s selloff came after a rough January for Chinese stocks, in which the main markets fell by over a fifth. Reuters has the details: Some 12 trillion yuan ($1.8 trillion) were sliced off the value of its benchmark indexes. The CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite indexes fell more than 20% each in January. Here\u2019s some reaction to the news that China\u2019s manufacturing sector has shrunk at its fastest pace since 2012: ANZ\u2019s chief China economist, Li-Gang Liu, says the factory slump will continue for some time. \u201cThe manufacturing sector will likely face a tough year ahead on the back of overcapacity, weakening global demand, and the government\u2019s plans to tackle pollution.\u201d Erwin Sanft, head of China strategy at Macquarie, says China\u2019s factory sector is dogged by overcapacity (via CNBC): \u201cThere\u2019s a realization that for a lot of these industries, there has to be a big downsizing. \u201cRather than avoiding that issue, plans are now being made as to how workers can be laid off and looked after. We expect there\u2019ll be some funding from the central government.\u201d Angus Nicholson of IG says today\u2019s PMI numbers confirm that momentum in Chinese economic activity has continued to weaken into 2016. It is quite concerning that the significant monetary and fiscal stimulus in 2015 has only managed to slow the rate of decline in China\u2019s industrial activity......It is looking like it will be quite a struggle for China to even hit its lowered growth target of 6.5% for 2016. It\u2019s been another bad day on the Chinese stock market. Shares hit a new 14 month low, after a new survey showed its manufacturing sector weakened last month. Activity across the Chinese factory sector shrank at its fastest rate in three years, according to the official purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). It came in at 49.4 in January, compared with the previous month\u2019s reading of 49.7 -- where any reading below 50 shows a contraction. This is the sixth month running where the PMI has shows China\u2019s factory sector has shrunk, hit by weakening demand at home and abroad. Data firm Markit reported that operating conditions deteriorated, with output and employment declining at slightly faster rates than in December And the news sparked another day of selling on the markets. The benchmark Shanghai Composite index shed 1.7%, or 48 points, to close at 2,689 points. That means it has lost 24% of its value since the start of 2016, as the Chinese stock bubble unwound. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a gusty morning in the City, as Storm Henry pays a visit. And traders will be hoping it blows January\u2019s volatility away with it, after a testing start to the year. European markets are expected to open calmly, after the sugar rush of Friday\u2019s Japanese shock move into negative interest rates runs out. A new month brings new economic data. We\u2019ll be getting manufacturing data from across Europe this morning, and the US this afternoon. The eurozone\u2019s factory Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index is expected to come in at 52.3, unchanged from December, showing moderate growth. A poor result would hint at fresh signs of slowdown in the global economy. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: We have the latest Spanish, Italian, French and German January manufacturing numbers, and here there has been some softening of data in recent weeks, as economic activity has dropped off. It\u2019s been the same story in the UK as well with the latest January manufacturing PMI expected to come in at 51.8, down from 51.9. Over in America, US authorities are expected to announce a $150m settlement with Barclays and Credit Suisse over their controversial dark pool trading platforms Internationally, we\u2019ll have one eye on Nigeria after it asked the World Bank and the African Development Bank for $3.5bn in emergency loans (more on that shortly). The other eye will be on Greece, where protest are escalating against the government\u2019s austerity programme and pension cuts. Over in parliament, MPs will be debating whether the UK city watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, is fit for purpose. And \u201cflash crash\u201d trader Navinder Sarao will be in court, fighting attempts to extradite him to the US. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Under a new deal negotiated with trade unions, any employee over 53 with 15 years of service will continue to receive slightly more than two thirds of their salary if they do not come in to work. They will remain under contract and the company will continue to pay their social security and private health contributions until they reach 65, thus saving the state the burden of further unemployment benefits. Under the voluntary scheme, anyone who joins it is free to return to full-time work. Telef\u00f3nica has about 28,000 employees in Spain \u2013 21,000 in the landline business, 6,000 in mobiles and 1,000 in Soluciones, its infrastructure unit. The company estimates that 7,000 people are eligible for the scheme, which runs until the end of next year. From next year, the scheme is expected to save \u20ac370m (\u00a3281m) a year, the company says, adding that the measure is part of the plan to \u201ctransform and simplify\u201d the business. The plan was agreed within a broader agreement on pay and conditions that Telef\u00f3nica reached with the union last July.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair expects to cut fares by 6% in the first three months of this year on the back of growing traffic and falling fuel costs. Europe\u2019s biggest airline said it was ready for a \u201cprice war\u201d as it announced a more than doubling of profit for the third quarter of its financial year. With pre-tax profit for the three months to the end of December up 110% to \u20ac103m (\u00a379m), Ryanair said it would spend \u20ac800m buying back its own shares to increase shareholder returns. Revenue increased by 17% to \u20ac1.3bn in the third quarter while total costs rose 13% to \u20ac1.2bn. Customer numbers rose 20% to 25 million as Ryanair expanded capacity. Costs per passenger fell 5% and were down 1% excluding fuel. The growth in profit came despite a 1% fall in average fares, as the airline reacted to a drop in demand after the terrorist events in Europe in November. The co-ordinated murder of 130 people in Paris on 13 November and the associated terrorist alert in Brussels caused bookings to fall for companies ranging from tour operator Thomas Cook to the train and coach operator Stagecoach. EasyJet, Ryanair\u2019s rival budget airline, said last week that revenue per seat fell sharply in November and December as people stayed away from flying. Michael O\u2019Leary, Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, said Ryanair cut prices after the Paris attacks in line with its strategy of selling the maximum number of seats. The company expects to save \u20ac430m in the next financial year because of lower fuel prices. He said: \u201cFollowing a strong first half of Q3, we noted weaker pricing and bookings immediately after the terrorist events in Paris and Brussels. We reacted to this softness by running price promotions and discounted fares to stimulate double-digit traffic growth. \u201cThe key driver over Q4 and into the first half of next year will be strong traffic growth, strong capacity growth but weaker pricing and weaker fares.\u201d He said the underlying trend was that customers were attracted by the Dublin-based carrier\u2019s low fares and attempts to make dealing with Ryanair more pleasant. O\u2019Leary, who previously revelled in Ryanair\u2019s cheap and nasty image, changed his approach two years ago and has made improvements such as removing irritating rules and improving the company\u2019s website. The group said it plans to buy back \u20ac800m of its own shares. Ryanair\u2019s chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said that the buyback, the biggest single return to shareholders in the airline\u2019s history, was \u201can indication of the strength of our balance sheet\u201d rather than propping up the share price. \u201cWe\u2019re investing over \u20ac1bn this year.\u201d He said the airline would be expanding into more central European airports, which were keen to court Ryanair with traditional airlines retrenching their short-haul operations, and the expected 6% drop in fares would make it even harder for legacy airlines to compete: \u201cWe\u2019re in the perfect environment for any fare war with our lower costs. \u201c While the 6% drop in fares is deeper than expected, Ryanair stuck to its guidance that annual profit would be close to the top of analyst forecasts of \u20ac1.18bn to \u20ac1.23bn. The shares, down 6% this year, rose 2.6% to \u20ac14.11. Meanwhile, rival EasyJet has marked the opening of its 27th European base, at Venice Marco Polo Airport. The airline\u2019s strengthening Italian operation will also see expansion at Milan Malpensa and Naples during 2016. Its 10 new routes from Venice include flights to Bristol and Edinburgh.",

      "body": "<p>Ryanair expects to cut fares by 6% in the first three months of this year on the back of growing traffic and falling fuel costs. </p> <p>Europe\u2019s biggest airline said it was ready for a \u201cprice war\u201d as it announced a more than doubling of profit for the third quarter of its financial year. </p> <p>With pre-tax profit for the three months to the end of December up 110% to \u20ac103m (\u00a379m), Ryanair said it would spend \u20ac800m buying back its own shares to increase shareholder returns.<br></p> <p>Revenue increased by 17% to \u20ac1.3bn in the third quarter while total costs rose 13% to \u20ac1.2bn. Customer numbers rose 20% to 25 million as Ryanair expanded capacity. Costs per passenger fell 5% and were down 1% excluding fuel.<br></p> <p>The growth in profit came despite a 1% fall in average fares, as the airline reacted to a drop in demand after the terrorist events in Europe in November. The co-ordinated murder of 130 people in Paris on 13 November and the associated terrorist alert in Brussels caused bookings to fall for companies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/25/travel-industry-in-greatest-turmoil-in-30-years-after-paris-attacks-says-thomas-cook-boss\">ranging from tour operator Thomas Cook</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/bus-train-travellers-avoiding-big-cities-over-terrorism-stagecoach\">train and coach operator Stagecoach</a>. EasyJet, Ryanair\u2019s rival budget airline, said last week that revenue per seat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/easyjet-revenues-paris-terror-attacks\">fell sharply in November and December</a> as people stayed away from flying.</p> <p>Michael O\u2019Leary, Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, said Ryanair cut prices after the Paris attacks in line with its strategy of selling the maximum number of seats. The company expects to save \u20ac430m in the next financial year because of lower fuel prices.</p> <p>He said: \u201cFollowing a strong first half of Q3, we noted weaker pricing and bookings immediately after the terrorist events in Paris and Brussels. We reacted to this softness by running price promotions and discounted fares to stimulate double-digit traffic growth.</p> <p>\u201cThe key driver over Q4 and into the first half of next year will be strong traffic growth, strong capacity growth but weaker pricing and weaker fares.\u201d</p> <p>He said the underlying trend was that customers were attracted by the Dublin-based carrier\u2019s low fares and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/20/ryanair-image-change-which-survey\">attempts to make dealing with Ryanair more pleasant</a>. O\u2019Leary, who previously revelled in Ryanair\u2019s cheap and nasty image, changed his approach two years ago and has made improvements such as removing irritating rules and improving the company\u2019s website.</p> <p>The group said it plans to buy back \u20ac800m of its own shares. Ryanair\u2019s chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said that the buyback, the biggest single return to shareholders in the airline\u2019s history, was \u201can indication of the strength of our balance sheet\u201d rather than propping up the share price. \u201cWe\u2019re investing over \u20ac1bn this year.\u201d</p> <p>He said the airline would be expanding into more central European airports, which were keen to court Ryanair with traditional airlines retrenching their short-haul operations, and the expected 6% drop in fares would make it even harder for legacy airlines to compete: \u201cWe\u2019re in the perfect environment for any fare war with our lower costs. \u201c</p> <p>While the 6% drop in fares is deeper than expected, Ryanair stuck to its guidance that annual profit would be close to the top of analyst forecasts of \u20ac1.18bn to \u20ac1.23bn. The shares, down 6% this year, rose 2.6% to \u20ac14.11.</p> <p>Meanwhile, rival EasyJet has marked the opening of its 27th European base, at Venice Marco Polo Airport. The airline\u2019s strengthening Italian operation will also see expansion at Milan Malpensa and Naples during 2016. Its 10 new routes from Venice include flights to Bristol and Edinburgh. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is close to taking control of Home Retail Group after agreeing an increased price of \u00a31.3bn for the owner of Argos. The supermarket was locked in talks with Home Retail last night and must make a formal offer by 5pm on Tuesday. However, despite the agreement on price, Sainsbury\u2019s could seek an extension to the deadline in order to complete due diligence. Sainsbury\u2019s had its first approach for Home Retail snubbed in November at a price believed to be about \u00a31bn. But it returned to its target in the new year and is now close to a deal. Investors are confident that an agreement has been reached between the two parties at a price of slightly more than 160p a share. This represents a sizeable premium for Home Retail shareholders, who saw the stock dive below 100p before news of Sainsbury\u2019s interest, and is not too high to scare off investors in Sainsbury\u2019s. Shares in Home Retail rose nearly 12% to close at 152.9p, their highest level since last summer, on hopes a deal would be agreed. Discussions stalled last week when Sainsbury\u2019s initially came back with offers of about 150p a share. The Sainsbury\u2019s management has promised its shareholders that it will not overpay for its bid target, no matter how keen it is to secure a deal. But talks today have been more productive, as market watchers said the supermarket group had the firepower to pull off an agreement. \u201cObviously if Sainsbury\u2019s really wants to do the deal, they\u2019d be stupid not to press on for the sake of 10p or so,\u201d said the retail analyst Nick Bubb. One of the key hurdles for Sainsbury\u2019s was to bring onside its largest shareholder, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). It has done this in the past few days by promising it will not overpay to secure the deal. The QIA has made it clear that it preferred not to have its 25% stake diluted nor be required to put too much more money into its investment. Sainsbury\u2019s appears to have persuaded the QIA of the merits of the deal, which helps the UK group fend off further expansion by Amazon into the UK grocery market. The supermarket owner is keen to acquire the skills in deliveries and logistics that have been built up by Argos. As many as 245 Argos shops could close if the merger goes through, however. Analysis by the property agent Harper Dennis Hobbs shows that 245 out of a total of about 800 Argos stores are within half a mile of a Sainsbury\u2019s outlet. Many of these would be under threat, with adverse implications for some of the 30,000 employees currently employed by Argos. The chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, Mike Coupe, had a demanding job persuading sceptical investors of the merits of the deal but analysts and industry watchers have increasingly been won round. Home Retail\u2019s largest shareholders are Schroders, with 19%, and Toscafund, with 7.25%. Both are believed to support the merger. Home Retail\u2019s recent \u00a3340m sale of the DIY chain Homebase, to the Australian retail group Wesfarmers, made it easier for Sainsbury\u2019s to purchase the retailer, given it had little interest in entering the hardware sector. News of the initial bid for Home Retail triggered immediate speculation that Sainsbury\u2019s would attempt to spin off Homebase as soon as possible. John Walden, Home Retail\u2019s boss, insisted recently that Argos would be able to survive on its own, but the group\u2019s ability to fend off a takeover was damaged by its profits warning after a tough christmas. Jamie Merriman, an analyst at the asset management firm Bernstein, has warned that a standalone Argos would struggle to lift sales at its established stores and faced increased costs from the implementation of the national living wage. The removal of Argos services from more than 100 Homebase stores under Wesfarmers\u2019 ownership would also affect sales and profits. In a note published last month, Merriman said a deal with Sainsbury\u2019s would mean Argos stores could move into spare space in its new owner\u2019s supermarkets. But she added: \u201cWe have long argued that Home Retail faces significant structural challenges at Argos and that like-for-like sales growth is not ensured. We do not believe that an acquisition by Sainsbury\u2019s would dramatically change this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tackling issues such as global inequality and the Syrian refugee crisis is difficult, former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright said on Sunday \u2013 even more difficult than fighting the cold war. Albright, who served as ambassador to the United Nations and was secretary of state under Bill Clinton, spoke as part of a panel at Wellesley College. The divisions brought out by the Syrian refugee crisis, she said, highlighted the issue of global inequality. \u201cIn order to have equality, you can\u2019t all of a sudden be separating people into smaller and smaller groups that actually are proud of their identity but hate the people next door,\u201d she said. According to Albright, no one \u201ccan even figure out who should sit at the table to solve the problem\u201d. \u201cI was in a meeting,\u201d she said, \u201cin which I turned to the person next to me and said: \u2018The cold war was a piece of cake in comparison to this. The world was divided between the red and [the] red, white and blue.\u2019 \u201cAt this point it\u2019s hard to keep track of who is who and the institutional structures are not helping equality at all, in terms of trying to figure it out.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also spoke at the event. Countries that help integrate refugees into their economies could see benefits down the road, she said. Their integration could lead to increases in demand and consumption, she said. Within the European Union, countries could see 0.2% of growth. \u201cYou will say this is not much, 0.2%. Well, in countries, where growth is 1.2% to 1.5%, another 0.2% is a plus. But that music is not going to be heard at the moment. One day it will be heard, I hope. We will continue singing it.\u201d Despite the turmoil in global markets, Lagarde said she did not think the world was entering another recession. \u201cWe still forecast a growth of 3.4% in 2016 and possibly of 3.6% in 2017,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, granted, a forecast for 2017 in the current situation is a bit of stretch, but we don\u2019t see a recession. \u201cWe see not as good growth as we would like see to respond to 200 million people who are looking for jobs at the moment, to make sure that advanced economies can actually provide donor packages that would help [developing] countries.\u201d Lagarde said another way to help reduce global inequality would be by reducing the gender wage gap. \u201cInequality, just like poverty for that matter, is sexist,\u201d she said. Lagarde went on to praise Barack Obama\u2019s executive order that requires companies with more than 100 employees to disclose salaries in terms of gender, ethnicity and race. In 2014, US women earned 79 cents for every dollar men earned. When Obama took office, that number was 77 cents. \u201cNow calculate how long it would take to get to one dollar each,\u201d Lagarde said. Cupping her hands around her mouth as if to make sure that everyone could hear her, she said: \u201cEighty years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boots is to cut up to 350 jobs in the UK as the pharmacy chain looks to reduce costs in its larger stores. This is the second round of job cuts at Boots in the last seven months, after an announcement in June last year that the company would cut 700 jobs in offices around the UK. In the latest round of redundancies, the company plans to cut between 300 and 350 assistant store managers at its biggest stores. Boots is now part of Walgreens Boots Alliance, one of the biggest retailers in the world, after the merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots in 2014. The company employs 60,000 people in the UK and Stefano Pessina, the chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, has pledged that Boots will remain committed to the UK despite the mega-merger. The latest reduction in the workforce will be achieved through a \u201ccombination of natural attrition, redeployment, retraining and redundancy\u201d, Boots said. The cuts are part of a drive to simplify the management structure within stores. Boots also announced that 400 employees working on its customer helplines will move to Teleperformance, which runs customer help centres for companies. The employees will continue to be based at Boots\u2019 head offices in Nottingham and retain their pay and benefits. The retailer also plans to invest in new training academies so staff can offer beauty advice to customers and will increase the base pay for its workforce. The starting pay for customer assistants outside London will rise from \u00a37.20 an hour to \u00a37.70, while the rate in London will rise from \u00a38.77 to \u00a39.07. Simon Roberts, the president of Boots, said: \u201cEverything we do at Boots is about helping people feel good. So many of our colleagues deliver amazing care for our patients, customers and communities everyday and we are actively working to make sure our people are rewarded for the great work they continue to do. \u201cI believe our plans will enable us to build an even better Boots and drive future growth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British factories enjoyed a pick-up in activity last month but the flagging global economy took its toll on exporters and the manufacturing sector shed more jobs. A closely watched measure of manufacturing, the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, beat economists\u2019 expectations and rose to a three-month high. The headline index hit 52.9 in January, up from 52.1 in December and well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction. Economists had forecast a slowdown and a reading of 51.7, according to a Reuters poll. \u201cThe UK manufacturing sector registered an uptick in its rate of expansion at the start of 2016, shrugging off a number of potential headwinds, ranging from global financial market volatility to localised flooding in the north of the country,\u201d said Rob Dobson, a senior economist at the survey compilers Markit. The survey of some 600 companies paints a more upbeat picture than official data for last year, which showed manufacturing output stagnated in the final quarter of 2015, leaving Britain\u2019s service sector to drive overall economic growth. But behind the main index on the PMI report, there were signs that volatility on financial markets and worries about the global economic outlook were hurting UK manufacturers. The UK report followed a manufacturing survey from China signalling its factory sector shrank again in January. Reflecting headwinds from China and other emerging markets, January\u2019s rise in UK manufacturing production was driven by a rise in domestic orders, the PMI survey compilers said. Export orders had declined, however, as companies cited stronger competition and tough market conditions. \u201cThe domestic market remains the key growth driver. In contrast, the trend in new export orders continues to disappoint, falling back into reverse gear in January. Even after recent easing in the exchange rate, a number of manufacturers are still finding that the strength of the pound against the euro is impacting order inflows,\u201d said Dobson. The performance of large-sized manufacturers was especially positive, whereas growth was comparatively \u201cmild\u201d at small and medium-sized companies, the report said. There was also more downbeat news on employment, after the prediction from the manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF that the sector will shed tens of thousands of jobs this year as it grapples with tough export markets, steel plant closures and a drop-off in business from the embattled oil and gas industry. The PMI report showed headcount was cut for the fourth time in the past six months. \u201cAlthough the rate of decline in staff headcounts was only moderate, it was nonetheless the fastest for almost three years,\u201d the report added. Commenting on the PMI, the EEF\u2019s chief economist Lee Hopley said the main activity index \u201cgot 2016 off to an encouraging start\u201d but she was cautious about the outlook. \u201cLooking beyond the headline there\u2019s conflicting signals, with growth drivers narrower in terms of sub-sector and size, and manufacturing posting job losses for the fourth time in the last six months,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question now is whether manufacturing will regain much-needed momentum in 2016 or whether today\u2019s figure will prove a false signal. The sector is likely to remain under pressure in the coming months from the ongoing weakness of the oil price weighing on manufacturers embedded in the oil and gas supply chain, along with weak demand from emerging markets.\u201d There was little sign in the report of inflationary pressures building in the economy, suggesting the Bank of England will remain happy to keep interest rates on hold at their record low of 0.5% for many months to come. After sharp drops in the price of many commodities, from oil to industrial metals, manufacturers\u2019 average input prices fell at the fastest rate for four months in January. Part of that fall in raw material costs was passed on to customers as lower factory gate prices, the fifth reduction in as many months. The Bank unveils its latest interest rate decision and forecasts for the economy on Thursday.",

      "bodyText": "With yet more disappointing Chinese data knocking back crude prices, commodity companies are again among the leading fallers as markets edge lower. After a turbulent January for investors, February is getting off to a downbeat start with the FTSE 100 currently down 20.01 points at 6063.78. Brent crude, which regained some ground last week, has slipped 1.4% to $35.48 after the poor Chinese manufacturing figures. So BP is down 4.4p at 371.7p ahead of results on Tuesday when it is expected to report a 70% fall in underlying profits. It has not been helped by Exane BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank both cutting their recommendations. Exane has reduced its target price by 3% to 330p while Deutsche Bank has moved from 450p to 445p. Prudential has dropped 38p to 1329.5p on news that the chief executive of its M&amp;G Investments business, Michael Mclintock, would retire after 19 years at the company. But BT is 15.15p better at 500p after it reported its best revenue growth for seven years in its third quarter. The company, which has just completed the acquisition of mobile group EE, said revenues had risen 4.7% with profits up 14% to \u00a3928m. Anglo American has added 5.85p to 283.30p continuing its recent recovery, while InterContinental Hotels has climbed 24p to \u00a323.21 following weekend reports of a possible $1bn return to shareholders. Rolls-Royce has unveiled a $2.7bn order from Norwegian for Trent engines and a service support package but its shares have failed to power ahead, falling 5p to 550p. Analysts at Liberum said: [This] is the biggest order since new chief executive Warren East took over at the company in July last year and good to see Rolls can still beat General Electric. However IFRS 15 [ a new accounting standard which comes into force in 2018] still clouds the earnings horizon and investors will need to wait until the end of the decade for more attractive cash generation. Hence, we remain on hold.",

It is switching by the end of 2016 to taking supplies only from farms that are either Rainforest Alliance \u2013 or Fairtrade Foundation certified. Last year, sales of Fairtrade goods fell for the first time since the ethical trading scheme was founded 20 years ago as cash-strapped consumers tightened their belts, spending more at discount retailers such as Lidl and Aldi. Both stores have to date sold a limited range of Fairtrade products, but are under pressure to give the public wider choice. The Fairtrade Foundation aims to protect farmers in developing countries by promising them a minimum price and financial support for community projects. In November, Asda became the first UK supermarket to make a public commitment to sourcing Rainforest Alliance-certified bananas \u2013 for 93% of its supply \u2013 with the rest from Fairtrade. Jon Covey, head of fresh produce buying at Lidl UK, said: \u201cIt is central to Lidl UK\u2019s corporate social responsibility policies that the business always acts in an environmentally friendly and socially conscious way. This move is yet another milestone in Lidl UK\u2019s ambition to provide its customers with sustainably sourced produce.

It has been working with its supply partners with the aim of switching the majority of the retailer\u2019s banana supply over to Rainforest Alliance- certified farms (88%) by the end of the year, with the remaining bananas coming from Fairtrade Foundation farms (12%). In December, Lidl became the first British retailer to stock Marine Stewardship Council-certified lobster.

      "bodyText": "As the taxation debate hots up this year, the latest tax expenditure figures released by Treasury on Friday show that there is a lot more to think about than just the GST, and that if the government ignores superannuation, it will mean overlooking one of the biggest potential sources of revenue. Tax expenditures show the amount of taxation forgone due to various exemptions, such as excluding GST on fresh food, or lower levels of taxation on certain income compared with the marginal income tax rates. The figures are seen as indicators of areas where revenue could be raised, and they involve considerable sums of money. In 2015-16, for example, the Treasury estimates the \u201crevenue forgone\u201d due to the discounts and exemptions on capital gains tax on the family home was equal to $54.5bn. We need to take care when talking about tax expenditures. Some economists \u2013 especially those who tend towards the \u201call tax is theft\u201d way of thinking \u2013 rather scoff at such a thing as tax expenditures even existing. They say that these figures are merely a theoretical construct and are so pointless that you might well work out how much tax is foregone because income isn\u2019t taxed at 100% and call it a tax expenditure. It is worth noting that the Treasury does not suggest that were the family home to be treated the same as any other capital item that the government would raise an extra $54.5bn. The reality is the Treasury doesn\u2019t know how much would be raised were capital gains tax to include the family home. Any changes to tax involve changes in behaviour, and for this reason, since 2013, the Treasury has also included an estimate of \u201crevenue gain\u201d should the tax expenditure be eliminated. This figure is usually a bit lower than the \u201crevenue forgone\u201d as the Treasury estimates people would change their behaviour to avoid paying the tax. But for some items \u2013 such as changing the capital gains tax on the family home \u2013 modelling what would happen is so uncertain that any figure would be rather too much of a guess than an estimate. As a result, they don\u2019t provide a figure for \u201crevenue gained\u201d for CGT on the family home. But they do for two very hotly contested tax expenditures \u2013 the concessions on superannuation contributions and earnings, and on GST-free items. In 2015-16 the debate over tax is set to take centre stage during the election. Talk of economic policies will inevitably be talk of respective tax plans. The government currently has \u201ceverything on the table\u201d but clearly in the mix is an increase in the GST and a cut to income and company taxes. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, echoing the Treasury secretary, John Fraser, has declared that government spending over 25% of GDP is some sort of sign of budget apocalypse and thus any tax changes will be about lowering overall tax revenue rather than to facilitate greater spending. Given government spending through both welfare payments and government services does much to reduce inequality, this means that the government will need to be mindful \u2013 for both political and economic reasons \u2013 of the impact of tax changes across the income spectrum. The Treasury estimates that levying GST on food would have raised $6.6bn in 2015-16, GST on education would have raised $3.8bn and on health $3.65bn. But all noises from the treasurer and others within the government suggest the government has ditched the idea of broadening the GST to include these items. While taxing consumption is always politically dangerous, it would appear the government feels merely raising the GST to 15% on things which already get GST is more palatable to voters than to broaden the list of things which will be taxed. Personally, if the GST were to be changed, I would be more in favour of broadening the base than increasing the rate. As I have argued in the past, and which the Grattan Institute found last year in its paper on GST \u201creform\u201d, a GST on education, for example, would actually be progressive: But the tax expenditure figures show that if you are really serious about filling the revenue hole, GST is small beer. On the other hand, if the tax concessions applied to superannuation contributions and earnings were abolished, Treasury estimates an extra $28.2bn of revenue would have been raised in 2015-16. Now that will never happen. No one is really suggesting the government should remove all superannuation concessions. There are good policy reasons to encourage people to contribute to their own superannuation. The problem is the concessions are currently loaded in favour of the wealthiest. At the moment super contributions are taxed at a flat 15% until you earn more than $300,000, at which point the rate goes up to 30%. The former ALP government also introduced a low-income super tax contribution which effectively means those who earn less than $37,000 pay no tax on their contributions. This measure, however, was cut by the Abbott government, and will cease from 2016-17. The ALP\u2019s current policy is to apply the 30% rate to incomes over $250,000 but as yet they have not said whether they would reintroduce the low income contribution: The superannuation concessions highlight the problems with most tax expenditures. First, they make the tax system more inequitable. In a progressive taxation system, concessions and exemptions generally favour the wealthy. Think of the exemption of capital gains tax on the family home. Such a policy, inherently favours those who actually own a home, and the benefit increases with the value of the home. Similarly, superannuation concessions greatly favour the wealthiest. The Murray inquiry into the financial services industry found that nearly 60% of the super concessions went to the wealthiest 20% of households. Thus, a majority of the concessions were going to people who were already unlikely to access the aged pension. One other issue, which the International Monetary Fund noted in 2014 when it found Australia had the highest level among advanced economies, is that tax expenditures are also subject to heavy lobbying. The superannuation industry strongly resists any suggestions of changes to the current concessions system. And given the electoral importance of people in retirement or those for whom retirement is in sight (49.4% of voting-age Australians are over 45 years of age), changing retirement is a tricky business: All the noises Morrison is making suggest changes will be made to superannuation tax concessions. And given changes would hit the Liberal party core constituency, it will be one of the bigger tests of the tax change process. Increasing the GST will inevitably hit the poorer harder than the wealthier, and the government also seems determined to cut spending. Thus, if Morrison\u2019s changes to superannuation are mostly window dressing rather than substantive, it will be tough for him to sell the tax \u201creform\u201d package as anything other than changes made to help the wealthy.",

That was a 2% increase on the cost to industry in 2014, according to the annual retail crime survey published on Monday by the British Retail Consortium, while the average value of goods stolen leaped by over a third to \u00a3325 per incident - also a record. Not only is the direct cost of crime now at its highest level on record, but it is more than three times higher than in 2007-08, the BRC warned. The total number of offences has dropped for the second year running, retailers reported, to 750,144 incidents. But the high value of items stolen compared with the drop inincidents shows that crime against retailers is increasingly being carried out by sophisticated criminals stealing to order. Customer theft still accounts for the majority of incidents of retail crime, at 83% of the total. Survey respondents \u2013 which account for 51% of the retail sector by turnover \u2013 pointed to the rise in the use of specialist equipment such as de-taggers and foil-lined bags to avoid detection, with 40% of crimes attributed to gangs, often working in groups. Fraud, including the burgeoning waves of online cyber-attacks, is also on the rise, the report said \u2013 up by 55% and, significantly, now accounting for more than a third of the cost of crime against retailers (36%). The human cost of retail crime has also grown.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A committee of MPs has attacked the government\u2019s productivity plan for lacking clear goals and original ideas on how the UK can catch up with other advanced economies. Productivity, often measured as the amount produced for every hour worked, has grown only slowly since the financial crisis, placing Britain even further behind its peers. The gap prompted the business secretary, Sajid Javid, to declare last year that \u201cboosting productivity is the economic challenge of our age\u201d. The government launched a productivity plan in July 2015. But in a report on Monday the Commons business, innovation and skills committee questions whether the plan is worthy of its name and urges the government to be bolder. The report is being published after the committee heard from big businesses that \u201cnot one of them had been consulted on the content of the productivity plan before its publication\u201d. Another of its key criticisms is a lack of targets. \u201cWe question whether the document has sufficient focus and clear, measurable objectives to be called a \u2018plan\u2019,\u201d the report says. The committee\u2019s chair, Labour MP Iain Wright, said that as it stands the plan risks \u201ccollecting dust on Whitehall bookshelves\u201d. \u201cIn recent years other countries have stormed ahead with productivity gains and we need to catch up,\u201d said Wright. \u201cAs a committee we welcome the government\u2019s focus on tackling this crucial issue for the UK economy. However, rather than being a clear and distinctive roadmap as to how Britain will close our productivity gap, the productivity plan is a vague collection of existing policies.\u201d On the latest figures output per hour from UK workers was 20 percentage points below the average of other leading industrialised nations. Economists say that the size of the economy and living standards would be significantly higher had pre-crisis growth rates for productivity been maintained. Britain\u2019s failure to boost productivity since the downturn, known as the \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d, has also been a focus for the Bank of England as it seeks to work out how much businesses can raise output without piling up inflationary pressures. Financial markets are keenly awaiting the Bank\u2019s outlook for inflation and economic growth published on Thursday amid turmoil on financial markets and signs of a slowdown in the UK and other big economies. A business survey published on Monday contains fresh signs that the gloomy global backdrop is knocking confidence among UK companies. Alongside a drop in confidence there was an increase in the number of firms operating below capacity over the last three months, indicating a further deterioration in productivity, as measured by the poll from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales with accountants Grant Thornton. The survey of 1,000 chartered accountants found that while exports were currently \u201cvery weak\u201d they were expected to improve thanks to a strengthening eurozone and a weaker exchange rate with the euro. After official data last week showed GDP growth edged up to 0.5% in the final quarter of 2015 from 0.4% in the third quarter, the ICAEW predicts growth will slip back again this quarter. \u201cThe decline in confidence points to only modest growth in GDP in the first quarter of 2016, at 0.4%,\u201d it said. The gloomy outlook could cause headaches for chancellor George Osborne ahead of his mid-March budget, said ICAEW chief executive Michael Izza. \u201cGrowth is expected to slow and will mean less income into the Treasury. If that happens, the chancellor simply won\u2019t meet his deficit reduction target. It will become a three-parliament problem,\u201d said Izza. \u201cAfter a particularly bullish autumn statement, the chancellor has had to row back on the immediate prospects for the UK economy. This presents new challenges for him and how he responds in next month\u2019s budget.\u201d A separate report from the CBI, which represents British businesses, also signalled that economic growth weakened in the three months to January, with modest expectations for the next quarter. The pace of growth dropped to its slowest rate since May 2013, according to this weekend\u2019s CBI Growth Indicator, which collates the views of 759 businesses cross the manufacturing, retail and services sectors. But the outlook for the next three months was more positive, with an above average rise in output expected. \u201cThe overall domestic outlook still looks fairly secure, and a rise in output across all sectors is expected in the coming three months. Low inflation, strong employment growth and rises in real pay also put households in a good position,\u201d said CBI director of economics Rain Newton-Smith. \u201cBut we\u2019ll need to keep watch on whether slower growth in parts of the service sector is the start of something more prolonged, particularly in light of global financial market volatility.\u201d",
