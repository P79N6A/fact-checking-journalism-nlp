    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears that Britain's housing market is headed for bubble territory were stoked on Monday by fresh evidence that demand is far outstripping supply. As the market heats up, buyers desperate to secure a property are paying the highest proportion of asking prices seen for a decade, according to a report from property researchers Hometrack. In London, buyers are paying more than 99% of asking prices against a backdrop of soaring demand from foreign investors and local house hunters. The figures come alongside a warning that the south of England faces a shortfall of at least 160,000 homes by 2018. An analysis of building projects by upmarket estate agent Savills finds that local planning authorities are \"simply not planning enough new homes to meet the growing housing need.\" The reports follow assurances from the Bank of England that it is poised to take steps to slow down Britain's housing market if the pickup in prices and mortgage demand signals a new property bubble. Hometrack said house prices rose 0.6% in March, a slight slowdown from 0.7% growth in February, on lower growth in London and the south-east. But it said the fundamentals suggested more house price growth ahead as demand grew 6.6% in March \u2013 which it measures by new buyers registering with agents \u2013 and supply rose 1.9%, based on new listings. Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack, stressed that not all areas were seeing surging demand with the north, north-west, Yorkshire and Humberside and east Midlands seeing price growth of less than 2%. He also rebuffed suggestions from some critics that the government's Help to Buy scheme was pushing up prices. \"The overall volumes of sales supported by the scheme remain relatively small. The real driver of higher house prices is record low mortgage rates and strong demand from first-time buyers and investors who have no property to sell which is compounding scarcity,\" he said. In a further measure of the imbalance between supply and demand, the proportion of asking price paid in March was 96.2%, the highest since 2004. The amount of time on the market fell to less than eight weeks for the first time since October 2007. Last week the Office for Budget Responsibility raised the prospect of the housing market becoming increasingly frothy in some areas. Robert Chote, head of the independent body, which produces forecasts for the government, told MPs on the Treasury committee : \"With very rapid house price increases in some parts of the country you might see bubbly activity where people are willing to buy stuff off-plan or not intend to live in it.\" But property firm Countrywide echoes Hometrack's caution over blaming Help to Buy for price rises. Its quarterly market review claims the scheme's equity loans are helping to boost housebuilding rather than prices. It compares regional house price rises with data showing how buyers are using the Help to Buy scheme's equity loans, which allow first-time buyers and movers to borrow up to 20% of the purchase price of a new-build property provided they have a deposit of at least 5%. More new homes have been bought using the loan scheme in areas which have seen the smallest increases in house prices over the past 12 months, the analysis by Countrywide suggests. While a fifth of all homes built since April 2013 were sold through the scheme, in some more depressed housing market areas the figure had reached 50%, Countrywide says. \"Claims that the Help to Buy scheme is causing a housing bubble are far from the truth and the facts speak for themselves. As a proportion of transactions both parts of Help to Buy together support only 2% of transactions in London compared with 10% in the north-west, where support is most needed,\" said Countrywide's chief executive, Grenville Turner. \"The scheme has had a positive impact on house builder confidence with many now believing that they can sell what they build, which as we know means they will build more.\" Savills warns that housebuilding in the south of England will remain way below what is needed to meet demand. With the difference between house prices in London and the south-east now \"higher than it has ever been\", Savills sees demand for areas around London ramping up and overflowing into places as far afield as Cambridge, Brighton, Reading and Oxford. Savills planning director, Jonathan Steele added: \"We need to plan larger scale developments as a matter of urgency to meet local need and anticipated London overspill.\" \"The chancellor's recent commitment to a new 'garden city' in Ebbsfleet, with an initial 15,000 new homes, is welcome but it is a drop in the ocean \u2013 the equivalent of just four months' requirement for housing in London.\"",

      "body": "<p>Housing prices are once again on the radar. Last week the Reserve Bank issued<a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/fsr/2014/mar/html/contents.html\"> its six monthly financial stability review</a> and the governor of the RBA, Glenn Stevens<a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2014/sp-gov-260314.html\"> gave a speech</a> in which he covered aspects of the housing market. This coincided with a number of<a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/business/property/house_prices_enter_danger_zone_vUB9g2ozif2q0H7iofrFCI\"> reports</a> in the media which noted that Australian housing prices have in the past six years zoomed well beyond that experienced in other countries, and<a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/personal_finance/smart_money/property_prices_headed_for_record_gSdGyBWsYfyuDcVBwatptN\"> that housing affordability</a> is at record lows.<br></p> <p>As ever the worry with housing prices really isn\u2019t much about affordability. Sure the word gets thrown around as though it\u2019s something to care about, but for the most part the concern is that housing will quickly get more affordable \u2013 because that will mean prices have fallen quickly.</p> <p>The recent price rises come off the back of record low interest rates, which the RBA had set in the hope that it would lower the value of the dollar and thus assist the non-mining sector, and also that it might spur housing construction.</p> <p>It\u2019s pretty clear the housing construction side of the ledger has worked. As Stevens noted \u201cover the past three months, approvals to build private dwellings were at the highest rate for at least three decades\u201d.</p> <p>But of course this increase in building of houses and increase in demand for housing due to low interest rates has led to a boom in prices.</p> <p>But, if we look at the housing prices since June 2010 \u2013 which was the last peak in prices, coming on the back of the GFC stimulus measures \u2013 the boom is very Sydney centric:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/PlDNs/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Excluding the small sample size of Darwin, Sydney housing prices have risen by more than double any other capital city since the last peak. Real estate agents in Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, Adelaide and even Melbourne must laugh ruefully when they read about the housing boom.</p> <p>But while this may give some cause to think the boom a myth, given the size and importance of the Sydney market the RBA cannot (and will not) dismiss it as an exception to the nationwide rule.</p> <p>The RBA\u2019s concerns about the housing prices are two-fold: for lenders, and for borrowers.</p> <p>The first concerns the exposure of banks to poor loans. In the financial stability review the RBA noted that the growth in housing loans was leading banks to fight harder for home loan business and that \u201csome banks have increased the discounts on their headline interest rates, waived application fees or raised upfront commissions to mortgage brokers\u201d.</p> <p>But the RBA remains mostly unworried about the risks taken by the banks as they suggested there was little evidence that banks were reducing their \u201cnon-price loan standards, such as loan serviceability and deposit criteria\u201d. Thus while they may be fighting for your money, they were not fighting to get anyone\u2019s money.</p> <p>This is of course of paramount importance. One of the major problems that caused the GFC was banks\u2019 willingness to lend to those with a high credit risk or who did not meet the usual loan approval requirements.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/fsr/2013/mar/html/aus-fin-sys.html\">In last year\u2019s review</a>, the RBA was already concerned about banks lowering their standards for borrowers when it warned that \u201cit is important that banks do not respond by imprudently loosening their lending standards\u201d. Although it did suggest then that \u201cthe available evidence suggests this is not occurring at this stage\u201d.</p> <p>This year the warning was a bit more pointed, noting that banks needed to be \u201cvigilant in maintaining prudent lending standards\u201d. It also noted that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) will soon be outlining \u201cits expectations for prudent housing lending practices\u201d.</p> <p>Thus the RBA and Apra seem unlikely to be about to introduce any \u201cmacroprudential tools\u201d such as those used in New Zealand (which I wrote about<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2013/aug/23/macro-prudential-mortgage-new-zealand\"> last August</a>). Stevens\u2019s speech and the financial stability review suggest the RBA wants more to be the stern father warning the kids to be good, rather than imposing any rules to attempt to enforce such behaviour.</p> <p>The worry about borrowers was nicely summarised in Stevens\u2019s speech when he stated that the record low interest rates had not thus far led to strong growth in credit, but that there had been a slight increase recently.

      "bodyText": "Housing prices are once again on the radar. Last week the Reserve Bank issued its six monthly financial stability review and the governor of the RBA, Glenn Stevens gave a speech in which he covered aspects of the housing market. This coincided with a number of reports in the media which noted that Australian housing prices have in the past six years zoomed well beyond that experienced in other countries, and that housing affordability is at record lows. As ever the worry with housing prices really isn\u2019t much about affordability. Sure the word gets thrown around as though it\u2019s something to care about, but for the most part the concern is that housing will quickly get more affordable \u2013 because that will mean prices have fallen quickly. The recent price rises come off the back of record low interest rates, which the RBA had set in the hope that it would lower the value of the dollar and thus assist the non-mining sector, and also that it might spur housing construction. It\u2019s pretty clear the housing construction side of the ledger has worked. As Stevens noted \u201cover the past three months, approvals to build private dwellings were at the highest rate for at least three decades\u201d. But of course this increase in building of houses and increase in demand for housing due to low interest rates has led to a boom in prices. But, if we look at the housing prices since June 2010 \u2013 which was the last peak in prices, coming on the back of the GFC stimulus measures \u2013 the boom is very Sydney centric: Excluding the small sample size of Darwin, Sydney housing prices have risen by more than double any other capital city since the last peak. Real estate agents in Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, Adelaide and even Melbourne must laugh ruefully when they read about the housing boom. But while this may give some cause to think the boom a myth, given the size and importance of the Sydney market the RBA cannot (and will not) dismiss it as an exception to the nationwide rule. The RBA\u2019s concerns about the housing prices are two-fold: for lenders, and for borrowers. The first concerns the exposure of banks to poor loans. In the financial stability review the RBA noted that the growth in housing loans was leading banks to fight harder for home loan business and that \u201csome banks have increased the discounts on their headline interest rates, waived application fees or raised upfront commissions to mortgage brokers\u201d. But the RBA remains mostly unworried about the risks taken by the banks as they suggested there was little evidence that banks were reducing their \u201cnon-price loan standards, such as loan serviceability and deposit criteria\u201d. Thus while they may be fighting for your money, they were not fighting to get anyone\u2019s money. This is of course of paramount importance. One of the major problems that caused the GFC was banks\u2019 willingness to lend to those with a high credit risk or who did not meet the usual loan approval requirements. In last year\u2019s review, the RBA was already concerned about banks lowering their standards for borrowers when it warned that \u201cit is important that banks do not respond by imprudently loosening their lending standards\u201d. Although it did suggest then that \u201cthe available evidence suggests this is not occurring at this stage\u201d. This year the warning was a bit more pointed, noting that banks needed to be \u201cvigilant in maintaining prudent lending standards\u201d. It also noted that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) will soon be outlining \u201cits expectations for prudent housing lending practices\u201d. Thus the RBA and Apra seem unlikely to be about to introduce any \u201cmacroprudential tools\u201d such as those used in New Zealand (which I wrote about last August). Stevens\u2019s speech and the financial stability review suggest the RBA wants more to be the stern father warning the kids to be good, rather than imposing any rules to attempt to enforce such behaviour. The worry about borrowers was nicely summarised in Stevens\u2019s speech when he stated that the record low interest rates had not thus far led to strong growth in credit, but that there had been a slight increase recently. He suggested that people \u2013 especially investors \u2013 \u201cneed to take care with the amount of leverage they take on\u201d, because \u201chouse prices can go down as well as up\u201d and he noted that \u201cthere have been two episodes where prices fell for a year during the past decade\u201d. In essence \u2013 don\u2019t count on permanently low rates and rising prices. One reason this remains a concern is that in December the housing-debt-to-disposable-income ratio reached its highest ever level: This level has been mostly flat since the GFC but has risen slightly in the past 12 months. There is however little sense it can rise much further. The housing boom of the early 2000s was based on debt rising from a ratio of 80% in 2001 to 132% in 2006. The current price boom is based on low levels of mortgage payments. Those low interest rates have enabled mortgage payments to be at about the ratio they were 10 years ago, despite housing prices being about 60% higher. But if rates go up, as Stevens lets us know they must, the only way housing prices can keep rising is if the overall level of debt also rises. But if 134% is near the maximum debt ratio households are able to take on, something will have to fall. And that thing would be housing prices.",

      "bodyText": "House of Fraser, the 165-year-old British department store chain, could be sold to one of China's richest men rather than floated on the London stock market. Sanpower, a conglomerate controlled by multimillionaire and former Chinese government official Yuan Yafei, has offered to buy the historic British chain for \u00a3450m, according to a source close to the company. The surprise bid, which was formalised late last week, comes just as bankers put the finishing touches to plans to float House of Fraser later this year. The retailer, which traces its roots back to a small Glasgow drapery shop opened by Hugh Fraser and James Arthur in 1849, had been pushing ahead with flotation plans after sale talks with France's Galeries Lafayette and Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley collapsed in January. A source close to the company said the IPO plans, which are being run by bankers at Rothschild, HSBC and Numis, will continue alongside the talks with Sanpower. Don McCarthy, House of Fraser's chairman who controls a fifth of the company's shares, is in favour of the Chinese offer according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the talks. If Sanpower does buy House of Fraser, it will be the latest in a string of high-profile British companies and assets to fall into Chinese hands. Hong Kong-based businessman Dickson Poon bought Harvey Nichols back in 1991. Manganese Bronze, the maker of London's black cabs, was bought by China's Geely for \u00a311m last year. Chinese companies also own Gieves &amp; Hawkes, the Savile Row tailor founded in 1771, luxury yacht firm Sunseeker, Weetabix, and \u00a345m-a-year worth of British pig semen through a deal agreed last December. Chinese firms also holds big stakes in Thames Water and Heathrow Airport. Sanpower claims to control 100 companies and employ 30,000 people across a wide range of areas including banking retail, media and property, but has yet to make any investments in the UK. It owns China's oldest and largest department store, Nanjing Xinjiekou. Yuan, who worked as a government official in Yuhuatai District, Nanjing City, set up Sanpower in 1993. He plans to build 1,100 \"lifestyle hubs\", boasting shopping, leisure, dining and entertainment centres, in China's biggest towns and cities over the next decade. Yuan, who does not appear to lack ambition, hopes to build the company into one of the world's biggest by next year. Sanpower says on its website: \"Striving to be a viable, thriving global enterprise with distinct Chinese roots and DNA, Sanpower aims to become a Fortune Global 500 Company by 2015.\" The company claims to own assets worth \u00a34.8bn.",

      "bodyText": "Whether it's noir detectives, Faroese knits or home furnishings, Scandinavian chic has never been cooler. Now the Danes have even given the pound shop a Nordic makeover and British shoppers can't get enough. It's lunchtime on Monday and trade in Tiger's central London store is brisk as office workers browse rainbow-coloured displays of toys, stationery and hobby paraphernalia such as knitting needles and glitter glue. With 80% of the products selling for \u00a35 or less, the concept is Danish design at Woolworths' prices. \"It's a bit like an Ikea marketplace on speed,\" says Maureen Hinton, retail analyst at Conlumino, describing a chain which is going from strength to strength in the UK. \"There's great design and it's cheap so you are always tempted to buy something. Also the loud music means it always seems cheerful.\" Founded by Lennart Lajboschitz, who started out running a market stall in Copenhagen's Israel Square, Tiger was conceived as a pound shop. Its name is a play on \"tier\" which is Danish slang for 10 kroner (\u00a31.10). With the ethos to sell \"stylish own branded products in a fun environment at astonishing low prices\", it quickly earned the nickname of the \"posh Poundland\" when it entered the UK. \"Just because it is affordable, it doesn't need to be nasty,\" explains Tiger UK managing director Philip Bier, a Dane who moved to the UK to study photography at the London College of Printing and never left. \"Scandinavia really appeals to Britain, whether it's on television or the high street. The bulk of what we sell costs \u00a31 to \u00a33. There are no gimmicks, no loyalty cards or sales, we don't do 99p. It's just very clean.\" UK shoppers have been quick to embrace Swedish and Danish brands with the likes of H&amp;M, Cos and Clas Ohlson now established high street names. After years working as a photographer, Bier became increasingly convinced that Tiger could be a hit in Britain. He risked everything by taking out a second mortgage to open the first UK store in Basingstoke in 2005. \"I met Lajboschitz socially on and off in Copenhagen and we thought it was a brand that would do really well,\" he says. \"My wife was pregnant and I remember waking up and thinking I'm going to be a 60-year-old photographer if or when my daughter goes to university. I liked the idea of her leaving university without any debt and that wasn't going to happen if I remained a photographer.\" After a slow burn start, which saw the company experiment with its products and locations, the retailer has now hit its stride with Bier's risk paying off handsomely. Last year, pre-tax profits at Tiger Retail UK jumped more than 60% to \u00a32.5m while sales increased from \u00a314.7m to \u00a321.3m. Tiger's Danish parent company Zebra has divided the UK into territories, with Bier in charge of expansion within a 60-mile radius of London. The Scottish chain is run out of Denmark, while Wales and the Midlands are also partnerships that knit together to create a 34-strong chain. Bier sees huge potential within his dominion: \"The Danish market is five million people and 64 stores \u2013 there must be a population of 25 million in my area so there is plenty to go at. We will be expanding rapidly throughout 2014, with new stores opening in urban affluent and fashionable high streets and shopping centres.\" Bier believes Tiger can become as influential as Ikea, which changed the way British homes looked when it arrived with its trendy pine furniture and traditional folk print cushions in the late 80s. Tiger, which is closing in on 300 stores in 20 countries, also has more financial firepower after Lajboschitz sold a controlling stake to Swedish private equity firm EQT two years ago. \"Originally we went head-to-head with pound stores,\" says Bier. \"Now we are a variety store heading towards becoming a design store. We have started to employ our own product designers now. When we first opened we were selling end of lines we bought from factories and there was no consistent look to the stores. That has completely changed.\" With more than 43,000 shops lying empty in the UK, high streets are crying out for new retailers and with many Britons yet to feel the recovery in their pocket, value retailers such as Poundland, Wilkinsons and Home Bargains are having a moment in the sun. \"Our timing is really good in that there is a need for real shops on the high street,\" says Bier. \"We are somewhere people can enjoy going to spend a few quid and leave without having to think too much about it.\" Instead of the usual variety store range of sweets and cleaning fluids, Tiger's top sellers include jumbo packs of herbs and spices, craft materials and retro toys such as water pistols and hula hoops. \"You go somewhere like Poundland for essentials but Tiger is more of an indulgence - and one that you can afford to indulge,\" says Hinton. \"If you are hosting a kids birthday party or putting together gift bags, you can afford to buy the things there and what is more people will actually like them. The design is a really important part of that.\" The Tiger aesthetic serves only to reinforce the Britain's rose-tinted view of Scandinavia where minimalist Scandi home furnishings is the icing on the cake of cheap childcare and proper cycle lanes. \"My (British) wife asked me why are all the people in Denmark middle-class?\" says Bier. His answer, offered with a smile: \"It's just the way it is.\"",

      "bodyText": "When Domino's sent two pepperoni pizzas on a 10-minute drone flight last summer in a publicity stunt to demonstrate how takeaways may be delivered in the future, Andreas Raptopoulos reacted with scorn. \"This is total nonsense. Why the hell would you do that? The public risk to transport a pizza around when you can do it perfectly well with all of the infrastructure you already have there? Why don't you use the same technology to save somebody's life when a mother needs medicine or a child needs medicine instead of it being stuck on a lorry on a muddy road. To me, this is where technology works best,\" the Greek entrepreneur said. Raptopoulos had had his eureka moment about the possibilities opened up by drones two years earlier. The night before a presentation at Silicon Valley's Singularity University \u2013 which aims to encourage business leaders to use technology to solve humanitarian problems \u2013 it had struck him that a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could deliver medical supplies across parts of the developing world inaccessible by road. That idea soon became a start-up called Matternet \u2013 a network for transporting matter \u2013 which aims to help the one billion people who do not have year-round access to roads. Raptopoulos said the new system would be used to leapfrog the building of infrastructure, in the same way mobile networks have overtaken fixed lines in poorly connected countries. In this case, eight-propeller UAVs can be used to transport small items weighing up to 2kg, establishing a potentially lifesaving connection decades before a modern road network could be built. \"Somehow the world caught on to this idea of using a technology [drones], which has a really bad reputation, for a really good cause and try to give the developing world not an example of following what the west has done but to figure out that there is a better way \u2013 to do for transportation what we did for communications,\" Raptopoulos said. In sub-Saharan Africa, 85% of roads are inaccessible during the wet season, cutting off huge swaths of the population and hindering the transport of medical supplies, he said. There are three parts to the system delivering medical goods: the UAVs themselves, landing stations where packages can be dropped off and transferred, and the software that ensures vehicles get securely from point to point. Because of their short battery life, networks of drones are needed to work together, shuttling between ground stations, said Raptopoulos. \"Instead of one vehicle running for 60 minutes, there would be six for 10 minutes each,\" he said. \"If you only fly between those [ground station] points, you know where those points are and [what is] around them. If there is a mountain, you know how to avoid it.\" He added: \"Then your job becomes connecting those two ground stations in the same way every time. Our concept is having those ground stations physically placed where you need them in order to put loads in the system.\" The operating system would also ensure that drones would not collide with each other. Matternet has carried out test runs in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Lesotho, in the middle of an Aids epidemic, has been identified by the company as somewhere the system could usefully transport laboratory samples around the countryside. A pilot is planned there for later this year. The company is part of a hope that came from the Singularity University that drones could become less a military tool than one with practical uses in the developing world. \"When you think of all the robotics companies in the world, I don't know any whose first customer was not military. This is how robotics companies are built,\" Raptopoulos said. \"We thought: screw that, we are going to replace the military with the humanitarian. \"I have a huge bias but I have not seen any application that I think is more important, more inspiring. We have this impression of robots being scary and taking our jobs. What if you took them to a place that really needs them and save lives?\" Most of the nine Matternet staff are based in a Palo Alto office, while the remainder work from London. Four investors have put money into the company and it aims to raise between $3m (\u00a31.8m) and $5m more in its next round of funding, in exchange for an undisclosed stake in the company. Aid agencies are being targeted as first users, Raptopoulos said, and pharmaceutical and logistics organisations will also be approached. Sales to the military have been ruled out. Ideally, villages would be able to buy the drones and base stations and transport items between themselves. \"Anybody can basically set up the transportation networks. It is decentralised. You don't need governments, you don't need big companies,\" Raptopoulos said. \"We won't replace trucks and trains but we are talking about helping these people leapfrog so that they have basic healthcare and maybe not build roads in the way we have. The thing I am spending most of my time on is how we show that this system can work in the field. \"Then, once we prove that and start scaling, there are all sorts of problems, like how do you make sure you have safety at scale and that thieves are not stealing [the drones]. I call them happy problems.\" He added: \"We are set up as a for-profit company and our goal is to change the world and we believe that profit will follow that. Somehow I feel the companies of the future are going to be like that.\" What it costs Approximate costings from Matternet put the price of unmanned aerial vehicles at \u00a36,000 each and ground stations at \u00a33,000 each. A network of five ground stations and 10 UAVs, as well as setup and training, would cost a charity in the region of \u00a390,000, according to Raptopoulos. An eight-propeller drone can carry 2kg and travel 10km in good weather. Batteries need to be replaced every 600 cycles. \"If [charities] know that this works and they know that it saves lives, it is not that big an amount,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>When Domino's sent two pepperoni pizzas on a 10-minute drone flight last summer in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on4DRTUvst0\" title=\"\">a publicity stunt</a> to demonstrate how takeaways may be delivered in the future, Andreas Raptopoulos reacted with scorn.</p> <p>\"This is total nonsense. Why the hell would you do that? The public risk to transport a pizza around when you can do it perfectly well with all of the infrastructure you already have there? Why don't you use the same technology to save somebody's life when a mother needs medicine or a child needs medicine instead of it being stuck on a lorry on a muddy road. To me, this is where technology works best,\" the Greek entrepreneur said.</p> <p>Raptopoulos had had his eureka moment about the possibilities opened up by drones two years earlier. The night before a presentation at <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/overview/\" title=\"\">Silicon Valley's Singularity University</a> \u2013 which aims to encourage business leaders to use technology to solve humanitarian problems \u2013 it had struck him that a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could deliver medical supplies across parts of the developing world inaccessible by road.</p> <p>That idea soon became a start-up called Matternet \u2013 a network for transporting matter \u2013 which aims to help the one billion people who do not have year-round access to roads.</p> <p>Raptopoulos said the new system would be used to leapfrog the building of infrastructure, in the same way mobile networks have overtaken fixed lines in poorly connected countries.</p> <p>In this case, eight-propeller UAVs can be used to transport small items weighing up to 2kg, establishing a potentially lifesaving connection decades before a modern road network could be built.</p> <p>\"Somehow the world caught on to this idea of using a technology [drones], which has a really bad reputation, for a really good cause and try to give the developing world not an example of following what the west has done but to figure out that there is a better way \u2013 to do for transportation what we did for communications,\" Raptopoulos said.</p> <p>In sub-Saharan Africa, 85% of roads are inaccessible during the wet season, cutting off huge swaths of the population and hindering the transport of medical supplies, he said.</p> <p>There are three parts to the system delivering medical goods: the UAVs themselves, landing stations where packages can be dropped off and transferred, and the software that ensures vehicles get securely from point to point. Because of their short battery life, networks of drones are needed to work together, shuttling between ground stations, said Raptopoulos. \"Instead of one vehicle running for 60 minutes, there would be six for 10 minutes each,\" he said. \"If you only fly between those [ground station] points, you know where those points are and [what is] around them. If there is a mountain, you know how to avoid it.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Then your job becomes connecting those two ground stations in the same way every time. Our concept is having those ground stations physically placed where you need them in order to put loads in the system.\"</p> <p>The operating system would also ensure that drones would not collide with each other.</p> <p>Matternet has carried out test runs in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Lesotho, in the middle of an Aids epidemic, has been identified by the company as somewhere the system could usefully transport laboratory samples around the countryside. A pilot is planned there for later this year.</p> <p>The company is part of a hope that came from the Singularity University that drones could become less a military tool than one with practical uses in the developing world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-433342057\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/30/1396186908638/Matternet-founder-Andreas-007.jpg\" alt=\"Matternet founder Andreas Raptopoulos \" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andreas Raptopoulos, CEO of Matternet, at its Menlo Park headquarters in Palo Alto.

This is how robotics companies are built,\" Raptopoulos said. \"We thought: screw that, we are going to replace the military with the humanitarian.</p> <p>\"I have a huge bias but I have not seen any application that I think is more important, more inspiring. We have this impression of robots being scary and taking our jobs. What if you took them to a place that really needs them and save lives?\"</p> <p>Most of the nine Matternet staff are based in a Palo Alto office, while the remainder work from London. Four investors have put money into the company and it aims to raise between $3m (\u00a31.8m) and $5m more in its next round of funding, in exchange for an undisclosed stake in the company.</p> <p>Aid agencies are being targeted as first users, Raptopoulos said, and pharmaceutical and logistics organisations will also be approached. Sales to the military have been ruled out. Ideally, villages would be able to buy the drones and base stations and transport items between themselves.</p> <p>\"Anybody can basically set up the transportation networks. It is decentralised. You don't need governments, you don't need big companies,\" Raptopoulos said.</p> <p>\"We won't replace trucks and trains but we are talking about helping these people leapfrog so that they have basic healthcare and maybe not build roads in the way we have. The thing I am spending most of my time on is how we show that this system can work in the field.</p> <p>\"Then, once we prove that and start scaling, there are all sorts of problems, like how do you make sure you have safety at scale and that thieves are not stealing [the drones]. I call them happy problems.\" He added: \"We are set up as a for-profit company and our goal is to change the world and we believe that profit will follow that. Somehow I feel the companies of the future are going to be like that.\"</p> <h2>What it costs</h2> <p>Approximate costings from Matternet put the price of unmanned aerial vehicles at \u00a36,000 each and ground stations at \u00a33,000 each. A network of five ground stations and 10 UAVs, as well as setup and training, would cost a charity in the region of \u00a390,000, according to Raptopoulos. An eight-propeller drone can carry 2kg and travel 10km in good weather. Batteries need to be replaced every 600 cycles. \"If [charities] know that this works and they know that it saves lives, it is not that big an amount,\" he said.</p> <h2>New in tech this week</h2> <p>\u2022 HTC's new Android smartphone, the One M8, has a 5-megapixel \"selfie\" camera on its front.

      "bodyText": "Forget Harold Wilson and the jumbo jets that allegedly cost Labour the 1970 election. Forget Nigel Lawson and the import binge of the 1980s. Britain has never seen bigger current account deficits than those it is notching up right now. Back in the 1960s, a deficit of 1% of national output would have been seen as dangerously high. A 3% deficit would have had investors heading for the exits, prompting a run on sterling. The shortfalls in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 averaged 5.5% of GDP, we learned last week, and yet the pound is seen as a safe-haven currency. This sanguine view of Britain's struggle to pay its way in the world may not last. Traditionally, less attention is paid to the UK's external accounts during tough times. Growth and unemployment are the indicators most closely watched. Once the threat of recession is banished, the GDP and labour market figures quickly become old hat. The focus switches from growth to over-heating and the measures that count are house prices, inflation, consumer spending and the balance of payments. That shift is starting to happen. Eyebrows were raised in the City last Friday at the size of a current account deficit that would be high even at the peak of a raging boom, let alone after nine months of a recovery from the worst recession in living memory. Concern is warranted. The past 15 years have seen the UK's share of world trade decline by 25%. The collapse in Britain's investment income since the financial crisis has exposed the structural weakness of trade in goods. Oil no longer provides the crutch it once did. And, unlike in previous cycles, a big depreciation of the currency has failed to lift the UK back into the black. Over the past year, a third of the 30% depreciation in sterling that occurred between 2007 and early 2009 has unwound. Investors have become more convinced of the UK's recovery and they think that the Bank of England will raise interest rates before the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. Money has come into Britain, pushing up the level of sterling. That has made imports cheaper, helping to nudge the inflation rate below 2%, but is making life tougher for exporters. The Bank of England would view any further appreciation in the pound as unwelcome, since it would hinder the rebalancing of the economy. But other than a bit of jawboning, there is not much Threadneedle Street can do. Cutting interest rates is one way of pulling down the value of a currency but they are already at 0.5%. Pumping more pounds into circulation through quantitative easing could be another way of achieving the same result, but the Bank has no desire to add to the \u00a3375bn of gilts it has bought since early 2009. Sterling's strength suggests the financial markets are happy to finance the deficit and so allow Britain to live beyond its means. The problem is that an untreated deficit is the same as a serious but untreated medical condition: eventually it can no longer be ignored. The UK's current account has two big components. The first is trade in manufactured goods, food, oil and services. Despite a healthy monthly surplus in trade in services \u2013 such things as banking, insurance, management consultancy, law and advertising \u2013 an even bigger monthly deficit in manufactured goods means trade is always in the red. The second component includes transfers to and from international bodies such as the UN and the European Union, and investment income \u2013 the difference between what Britain makes on its overseas investments and what overseas investors make on their investments here. There was a large surplus in investment income in the pre-crash years, but this was largely the result of the willingness of UK investors to take risky, but high yielding bets. Investment income bounces around from quarter to quarter, but the trend in the more cautious post-crisis environment has been downwards. John Mills, businessman and donor to the Labour party, has written a pamphlet for the thinktank Civitas, called There is an Alternative, in which he concludes that rebalancing the economy and securing a lasting increase in the growth rate requires a big fall in the value of sterling. The paper says that cutting the value of the pound by 31% in 2014 and holding it at that level would allow the economy to expand by 4-5% a year, double investment in the next five years and reverse the decline in manufacturing as a share of GDP. This could be achieved while keeping the inflation rate at 3% and while delivering real increases in consumer spending each year. It all sounds remarkably simple, but don't expect the Mills blueprint to become official Labour party policy any time soon. For a start, it is unclear how the government could arrange a 31% depreciation of the currency in a floating exchange rate world. Britain's ability to exploit the drop in the value of the pound would depend on increasing industrial capacity fast. But a hefty proportion of the investment goods necessary to make this happen would need to be imported because they are no longer made domestically. These would become more expensive. The same applies to energy, food and consumer goods, where import penetration is also high. The poor, who spend more of their incomes on staples, would suffer unless there was considerable redistribution of income. On past form, Britain's manufacturers would not use the 31% depreciation to expand market share, but would plump up their profit margins instead. Two final points. Manufacturing would get some boost from a much lower pound, but the big winner would be the service sector, already hyper-competitive and which has the capacity to expand quickly. And is it the triumph of hope over experience to imagine that the UK could combine 4-5% growth with 3% inflation? In the past 100 years, Britain has come off the gold standard, devalued the pound in 1949 and 1967, had a colossal sterling crisis in 1976 and been blown out of the exchange rate mechanism in 1992. Getting the exchange rate right is part of the rebalancing story, but only part of the solution. The Asian tiger economies made sure they had under-valued currencies when they embarked on rapid industrialisation. So did China. But they also protected their infant industries, identified manufacturing sectors they wanted to exploit, squeezed consumption in order to divert resources into investment and exports, and deployed capital controls to prevent their strategy being blown off course. These were developing countries that thought of themselves as developing countries. If Britain is serious about rebalancing and re-industrialisation, it will take more than a change in the exchange rate, it will take a change of mindset.",

      "body": "<p>Compensation can have its benefits. Sometimes, though, the wider value of ordering payouts for those who consider themselves wronged is less clear.</p> <p>Take the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/28/fca-investigation-invesments-pensions-endowments\" title=\"\">latest investigation by the City's new regulator</a>, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The watchdog says it will begin a review in the summer of the \u00a3150bn closed pensions and life assurance market to detect whether there has been any malpractice. The investigation is expected to span the last 30 years and will involve quizzing insurers about their products, how they sold them and how they applied charges, commissions and fees.</p> <p>Much of the investigation will focus on an estimated 30m policies sold in the 1980s and 1990s by insurers that no longer exist. These products have subsequently suffered as they were sold on from one owner to another, each applying new charges and cost structures to their benefit and customers' detriment \u2013 at least that is what consumer groups fear may have happened. Policy terms will also come under scrutiny, and especially the exit fees that lock in customers until the policy's maturity.</p> <p>Although another huge payout is unlikely in this case, it is worth revisiting the financial consequences of a series of regulatory scandals in past years.</p> <p>More than \u00a340bn has left the industry in compensation over 15 years to cover the mis-selling of personal pensions, endowments and payment protection insurance (PPI). Thousands of cars, buy-to-let deposits and conservatories were funded by payouts that netted many people five-figure sums.</p> <p>Yet apart from the benefit of redress to people bamboozled into buying poor products, it is hard to see what good these reviews have done. The financial services industry has learnt little. It keeps marketing products with charges that enrich the industry at the expense of customers. It still pays bosses bonuses for winning customers without a care for the long-term costs. These episodes even make the industry cynical about the regulator and how it handles complaints.</p> <p>The mis-selling of personal pensions derived from a deregulation of the market by Nigel Lawson in the 1980s that encouraged the development of unnecessarily complex products. It was also, like the endowment boom, based on unfeasible forecasts of investment returns produced by everyone from the most excitable City traders to the most studious actuaries.</p> <p>PPI mis-selling was different, maybe because it was primarily a banking scandal and not an insurance bungle. It was different because it was a massive wrong perpetrated by the industry on its customers. Commission payments helped to boost pension and endowment sales; they were the only reason for making PPI sales.</p> <p>Compensation has failed to alter industry behaviour, primarily because the regulator has neither the power nor the inclination to tackle those at the top. Martin Wheatley, the FCA boss, has showed no interest in bringing the PPI bosses to book.</p> <p>Furthermore, the FCA's predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, refused to learn the lessons of the endowment crackdown and limit the scope for ambulance-chasing compensation firms to cash in. Advertising on daytime TV with the regulator's blessing, they made a killing advising endowment claimants and, sure enough, in three years they have raked in more than a third of the estimated \u00a322bn PPI compensation total.</p> <p>The same could happen all over again following George Osborne's deregulation of the retirement market. His move in the budget to release pension savers from the constraints of buying an annuity opens up all kinds of possibilities for exploitation by an unreconstructed industry.</p> <p>Free marketeers heralded the move as bringing back <em>caveat emptor</em> to financial services. You should shop for a retirement income much as you would baked beans, they said. That's until it goes wrong, when compensation will be the remedy \u2013 again.</p> <h2>Tech firms have the wealth to put the world online<br></h2> <p>Virtual reality goggles, driverless cars, solar-powered drones that beam internet connections from the skies with infrared lasers \u2026 Facebook and Google may be familiar names, but their research and development is moving increasingly into the realm of science fiction.</p> <p>Explaining his decision to splurge <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/26/facebook-buys-oculus-virtual-reality\" title=\"\">$2bn on gaming headset developer Oculus last week</a>, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg said that while we are all glued to our smartphones today, he is busy getting ready for tomorrow.</p> <p>But it is the 29-year-old entrepreneur's <a href=\"http://internet.org/\" title=\"\">internet.org</a> alliance with fellow tech companies Ericsson, Samsung, Nokia and others that seems the most worthwhile and realistic project. The plan is to develop technology that can connect the four billion people who don't have internet access. This is why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/28/facebook-plans-solar-powered-drones-internet-access\" title=\"\">Facebook spent $20m on a company in Somerset that designs solar-powered drones</a>. Ascenta, run by engineer Andrew Cox, will become part of internet.org's Connectivity Lab.</p> <p>Google is at it too, launching balloons from New Zealand it hopes will eventually form a ring around the southern hemisphere, beaming an uninterrupted internet pathway.</p> <p>None of this will be easy.

      "bodyText": "Compensation can have its benefits. Sometimes, though, the wider value of ordering payouts for those who consider themselves wronged is less clear. Take the latest investigation by the City's new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The watchdog says it will begin a review in the summer of the \u00a3150bn closed pensions and life assurance market to detect whether there has been any malpractice. The investigation is expected to span the last 30 years and will involve quizzing insurers about their products, how they sold them and how they applied charges, commissions and fees. Much of the investigation will focus on an estimated 30m policies sold in the 1980s and 1990s by insurers that no longer exist. These products have subsequently suffered as they were sold on from one owner to another, each applying new charges and cost structures to their benefit and customers' detriment \u2013 at least that is what consumer groups fear may have happened. Policy terms will also come under scrutiny, and especially the exit fees that lock in customers until the policy's maturity. Although another huge payout is unlikely in this case, it is worth revisiting the financial consequences of a series of regulatory scandals in past years. More than \u00a340bn has left the industry in compensation over 15 years to cover the mis-selling of personal pensions, endowments and payment protection insurance (PPI). Thousands of cars, buy-to-let deposits and conservatories were funded by payouts that netted many people five-figure sums. Yet apart from the benefit of redress to people bamboozled into buying poor products, it is hard to see what good these reviews have done. The financial services industry has learnt little. It keeps marketing products with charges that enrich the industry at the expense of customers. It still pays bosses bonuses for winning customers without a care for the long-term costs. These episodes even make the industry cynical about the regulator and how it handles complaints. The mis-selling of personal pensions derived from a deregulation of the market by Nigel Lawson in the 1980s that encouraged the development of unnecessarily complex products. It was also, like the endowment boom, based on unfeasible forecasts of investment returns produced by everyone from the most excitable City traders to the most studious actuaries. PPI mis-selling was different, maybe because it was primarily a banking scandal and not an insurance bungle. It was different because it was a massive wrong perpetrated by the industry on its customers. Commission payments helped to boost pension and endowment sales; they were the only reason for making PPI sales. Compensation has failed to alter industry behaviour, primarily because the regulator has neither the power nor the inclination to tackle those at the top. Martin Wheatley, the FCA boss, has showed no interest in bringing the PPI bosses to book. Furthermore, the FCA's predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, refused to learn the lessons of the endowment crackdown and limit the scope for ambulance-chasing compensation firms to cash in. Advertising on daytime TV with the regulator's blessing, they made a killing advising endowment claimants and, sure enough, in three years they have raked in more than a third of the estimated \u00a322bn PPI compensation total. The same could happen all over again following George Osborne's deregulation of the retirement market. His move in the budget to release pension savers from the constraints of buying an annuity opens up all kinds of possibilities for exploitation by an unreconstructed industry. Free marketeers heralded the move as bringing back caveat emptor to financial services. You should shop for a retirement income much as you would baked beans, they said. That's until it goes wrong, when compensation will be the remedy \u2013 again. Tech firms have the wealth to put the world online Virtual reality goggles, driverless cars, solar-powered drones that beam internet connections from the skies with infrared lasers \u2026 Facebook and Google may be familiar names, but their research and development is moving increasingly into the realm of science fiction. Explaining his decision to splurge $2bn on gaming headset developer Oculus last week, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg said that while we are all glued to our smartphones today, he is busy getting ready for tomorrow. But it is the 29-year-old entrepreneur's internet.org alliance with fellow tech companies Ericsson, Samsung, Nokia and others that seems the most worthwhile and realistic project. The plan is to develop technology that can connect the four billion people who don't have internet access. This is why Facebook spent $20m on a company in Somerset that designs solar-powered drones. Ascenta, run by engineer Andrew Cox, will become part of internet.org's Connectivity Lab. Google is at it too, launching balloons from New Zealand it hopes will eventually form a ring around the southern hemisphere, beaming an uninterrupted internet pathway. None of this will be easy. The technology exists, pioneered by British engineers; the problem is regulation. While balloons and drones will fly at altitudes comfortably above those of civilian aircraft, they will have to cross commercial airspace, and air traffic controllers have long resisted the idea that pilotless objects are safe around jets cruising at 600 miles an hour. Connecting people by land, however, is expensive. Telecoms companies have seen digital groups grow rich by using their networks without having to invest a penny in building the infrastructure, and telecoms investors are reluctant to spend more money extending their footprint when the profits will all flow straight to Silicon Valley. If Facebook and Google want to get more people online, they may have to build their own networks. They have the money and the influence. Regulators tend to be immune to large cheques, but Zuckerberg's ambition to connect the planet has huge political appeal. Budget airlines need to lose the cheap suits There was further confirmation of the budget airline industry's ascension to aviation royalty last week with the news that easyJet will become the dominant operator at Gatwick airport's north terminal. This means British Airways will probably move back to the smaller southern terminal at the second-largest airport in the UK. While this confirms easyJet's status as a major player in the British aviation industry, it also underlines the fact that this carrier \u2013 and its bigger rival, Ryanair \u2013 are mature operators. EasyJet cannot afford a repeat of the staffing problems that caused severe disruption at its Gatwick operations in summer 2010, because its size brings with it an expectation of reliability. The example of Ryanair is a chastening one. The Irish airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has admitted that the airline is a tad too brash for its current status as an industry big-hitter and has launched an image overhaul that is still in progress. It's a hard lesson, but easyJet and its peers are learning that the old cheeky chappy act will not work any more.",

      "bodyText": "Goldilocks skipped merrily back into the world of economics commentary last week as the more upbeat seized on Britain's current mix of strong growth and benign inflation \u2013 not too hot and not too cold. But she really shouldn't get too comfortable. There are worrying signs that the UK has failed to learn the lessons of the financial crisis and that there is trouble in store. Among the many charts published by the Office for Budget Responsibility for George Osborne's budget this month was a particularly unsettling one. The watchdog's forecasts for household borrowing show the return of a dangerous trend. The ratio of household gross debt to income has been falling steadily since 2008, but the OBR sees it picking up again \u2013 at a faster rate than it had been predicting last December \u2013 and will have climbed back to near its pre-crisis level by 2019 (see below). On the savings side, the news is equally grim. Official figures last week showed Britain's household savings ratio \u2013 a measure of disposable income set aside rather than spent \u2013 slumped to 5.1% last year from 7.3% in 2012. The last time the ratio was lower than this was in the big-spender days of 2008, when it fell right down to 2.2%. And talking of big spenders, numbers from the high street complete the picture: retail sales jumped by 1.7% last month, smashing forecasts from City economists for a 0.5% increase. There are signs that household finances are improving, but if the OBR's outlook is to be believed, spending over coming years will be driven not by increased wealth, but by more borrowing. It is all the more worrying that this rising indebtedness comes just as interest rates will finally start to rise after their longest period on hold since the 1940s. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at German bank Berenberg and former economist at the Bank of England, says the OBR chart is telling us that \"the UK is going back to the old days\". His own view is that the recovery is not debt-fuelled yet, but it will be soon. \"Loose monetary policy is gaining traction \u2013 driving confidence up and saving down,\" he warned. To avoid a return to those days, Wood says, his former employer must consider raising rates sooner than the hinted second quarter of 2015. When the move up from 0.5% does come, it will be the first interest rate rise for seven years and must raise questions about how a whole young generation of borrowers will cope. Since the Bank of England last raised the base rate in July 2007, almost 1.5 million first-time buyers have come into the housing market, according to LSL Property Services, which compiles monthly data. Add to that the students who have taken on rising debt against the backdrop of increasing tuition costs, and the young people borrowing as they fail to secure well-paying jobs (or any job at all). A whole army of borrowers has never seen borrowing costs rise. For them, an ultra-loose monetary policy is the norm. When a rate rise comes, it will be a \"shock to the system\", says Richard Sexton, head of e.surv, the chartered surveyor arm of LSL. \"In the good times \u2013 and these are relatively good times \u2013 people don't make provisions,\" he says. In his view the government has a lot to answer for. Its Help to Buy scheme has unlocked the property market for young buyers but it has not been accompanied by enough advice on what happens when rates rise. That is sad, but not surprising \u2013 the financial education charity MyBnk says 90% of the UK population have never received any form of money management lessons. That has to change. It is true that years of austerity have seen many households forced to turn to borrowing to pay for essentials. But when it comes to unserviceable debts, much of the problem is due to lack of financial knowhow, not lack of income. People in the financial advice industry say the problems are much more fundamental than what happens when rates rise next year. Young people are more likely to have heard of payday lenders such as Wonga than savings schemes or the Money Advice Service, says Rob Gardner, who runs pensions adviser Redington and set up a financial education programme called RedStart last year. He claims to regularly comes across young adults who think a loan with a high interest rate is better than one with a low rate. The government has already taken some steps to fill the knowledge vacuum with financial education becoming part of the national curriculum for England from September. There are, however, very legitimate concerns about how classes will be taught. If only one-tenth of British adults have had any financial education, how confident will teachers feel in delivering these new classes? The demand that schools do more must come with better resources, or we risk a repeat of the calamitous situation with careers advice after responsibility was taken from local authorities and thrust onto schools. But there is an additional way to fill the gap. Here is a chance for Britain's vast financial sector to give something back. Some fund managers and bankers already donate their time to run workshops in basic financial concepts. More should join them. But if they do, it must be honest teaching. Cautionary tales such as the saga of mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) will have to be right up there with the lessons on saving for a rainy day.",

      "bodyText": "Back in 2012, when Sports Direct last attempted to award its founder, Mike Ashley, millions of free shares, the company was forced to scrap the proposal after shareholder outrage. Ashley doesn't receive a salary or bonus for his heroic hours on behalf of the retailer, but no matter: his 62% stake in the business seemed to motivate him pretty well on its own, as the shares have increased by 200% in the past two years, which means the company is now worth \u00a35.2bn. So when shareholders convene at the group's Derbyshire headquarters on Friday to vote on a fresh Ashley \"incentive\" plan \u2013 devised by supposedly independent directors and handing their boss 8m extra shares \u2013 investors have pretty strong evidence that the gift might simply be a waste of their funds. The share bonus \u2013 worth about \u00a369m at current prices \u2013 is apparently needed to persuade Ashley to attempt to clear a few \"stretching targets\", which presumably means his \u00a33.2bn stake is not up to the task. Crispin Odey, the hedge fund manager with a palatial chicken house as well as a 7.3% Sports Direct stake, has bought the argument. But why don't the remaining investors call the board's bluff? Any slowdown in Sports Direct performance will hurt Ashley most. That is incentive enough. Nice budget George. Now about those Lloyds branches\u2026 Poor George Osborne. The chancellor hasn't always had the smoothest ride at Treasury select committee sessions, but he might have been looking forward to this week's talk about his budget, which seems to have buoyed his party in the polls. Until late last week, that is, when a letter from the committee's chairman, Andrew Tyrie, arrived and put a new slant on the likely line of questioning. Tyrie \u2013 who has been trailblazing a revolutionary approach to leading select committees by experimenting with competence \u2013 wants to know if there was political interference in the humiliating and aborted sale of Lloyds bank branches to the Co-op. Lord Levene, who led a rival bidder, has repeatedly alleged that there was. Former Co-op bank chairman Paul Flowers has been less consistent: telling the committee there was no interference, before remembering lots when asked by the BBC. \"We would be grateful to know what was said, to whom, and when,\" Tyrie wrote to the chancellor, not unreasonably. He then added, ominously: \"The committee will want to explore this with you during our meeting on the budget.\" Rare excitement at United A big week for the Glazer family: you may have heard that they own a few shares in a low-profile sports business called Manchester United plc. The company's main trading period hasn't been progressing as expected, with like-for-like returns under new boss David Moyes well down, and a big Champions League fixture against Bayern Munich threatens to end the season. Still, despite poor results on the field, Wall Street has been getting rather distracted by rumours about bids for the club from Qatar, and the shares bounced last week. Who really knows where these deal tales originate, but the emirate has previously been identified as sizing up various UK assets \u2013 and the rumour-mongers have a strike rate comparable with the likes of Old Trafford legend Garry Birtles. Only last year Qatar was supposedly bidding for Arsenal (not yet), launching a Dream Football League to challenge the Champions League (still waiting), and making a tilt at Marks &amp; Spencer (er, ditto). Sometimes the Qatar tales do turn out to be true, but plenty of watchers of Man U shares reckon it will be more productive to watch the Bayern match than the rumour mill this week. Qatar supposedly buys trophy assets, they say, not trophy-less assets.",

But why don't the remaining investors call the board's bluff? Any slowdown in Sports Direct performance will hurt Ashley most. That is incentive enough.</p> <h2>Nice budget George. Now about those Lloyds branches\u2026<br></h2> <p>Poor George Osborne. The chancellor hasn't always had the smoothest ride at Treasury select committee sessions, but he might have been looking forward to this week's talk about his budget, which seems to have buoyed his party in the polls.</p> <p>Until late last week, that is, when a letter from the committee's chairman, Andrew Tyrie, arrived and put a new slant on the likely line of questioning.</p> <p>Tyrie \u2013 who has been trailblazing a revolutionary approach to leading select committees by experimenting with competence \u2013 wants to know if there was political interference in the humiliating and aborted sale of Lloyds bank branches to the Co-op.</p> <p>Lord Levene, who led a rival bidder, has repeatedly alleged that there was. Former Co-op bank chairman Paul Flowers has been less consistent: telling the committee there was no interference, before remembering lots when asked by the BBC.</p> <p>\"We would be grateful to know what was said, to whom, and when,\" Tyrie wrote to the chancellor, not unreasonably. He then added, ominously: \"The committee will want to explore this with you during our meeting on the budget.\"</p> <h2>Rare excitement at United</h2> <p>A big week for the Glazer family: you may have heard that they own a few shares in a low-profile sports business called Manchester United plc.</p> <p>The company's main trading period hasn't been progressing as expected, with like-for-like returns under new boss David Moyes well down, and a big Champions League fixture against Bayern Munich threatens to end the season.</p> <p>Still, despite poor results on the field, Wall Street has been getting rather distracted by rumours about bids for the club from Qatar, and the shares bounced last week.</p> <p>Who really knows where these deal tales originate, but the emirate has previously been identified as sizing up various UK assets \u2013 and the rumour-mongers have a strike rate comparable with the likes of Old Trafford legend Garry Birtles. Only last year Qatar was supposedly bidding for Arsenal (not yet), launching a Dream Football League to challenge the Champions League (still waiting), and making a tilt at Marks &amp; Spencer (er, ditto).</p> <p>Sometimes the Qatar tales do turn out to be true, but plenty of watchers of Man U shares reckon it will be more productive to watch the Bayern match than the rumour mill this week. Qatar supposedly buys trophy assets, they say, not trophy-less assets.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Six big questions that the British energy industry must answer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This is the biggest investigation of the British energy markets since privatisation and deregulation began in the 1980s. But the inquiry, triggered last week by a trio of watchdogs led by Ofgem and to be undertaken by the new Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) immediately sparked dire warnings that go to the heart of Britain's energy policy paralysis. British Gas owner Centrica and a raft of analysts said a probe that could last two years will freeze investment in much-needed power stations and make blackouts more likely. Ofgem and energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey countered that a proper and full investigation would clear the air and rebuild trust among consumers. But it will take more than a competition probe to restore faith in British energy policy. There are six questions the energy industry needs to answer as it tackles the wider issue of how Britain can modernise and decarbonise its power industry without pushing up prices and driving vast numbers of people into fuel poverty. What do we do about the big six? It is highly unlikely that Margaret Thatcher, the political cheerleader for deregulation and privatisation, envisaged a world where the state-owned Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and the 12 regional English electricity boards would end up almost entirely in the hands of the largely foreign-owned companies we now know as the big six. She would surely have blanched at the idea that a state-owned French company, Electricit\u00e9 de France (EDF), would hold major stakes in the supply sector and own most of the former CEGB's nuclear power stations. British Gas was privatised in 1986 and has remained in UK hands but nearly 30 years later still controls 40% of the gas market, plus a further 25% of the electricity supply. The privatised firms took over an industry which had seen plenty of investment, so the new owners felt able to concentrate on cost-cutting and neglect the building of new plants. This continued until they were encouraged to \"dash for gas\", building plants that eventually undermined the coal- and nuclear-powered stations to a point where the privatised British Energy \u2013 now part of EDF \u2013 had to be given a \u00a33bn state bailout. Power generating companies are no longer strictly separate from energy suppliers, which has allowed the big six to colonise and dominate both sectors, and stop new entrants expanding, say independent suppliers. Regulator Ofgem has only recently begun trying in earnest to reform the sector, fining companies for breaking their licence agreements, be it for mis-selling, poor handling of complaints, or overcharging. In the meantime a key measure of a healthy market \u2013 customers switching from one supplier to another \u2013 has failed to take root, while collective prices \u2013 and profits \u2013 have risen. Customers have been infuriated by ever higher bills \u2013 pushed up by rising wholesale power prices, plus the cost of subsidising low-carbon energy projects such as windfarms \u2013 and politicians have been goaded into promises of action. The Big Six have always argued that they are working harder than ever to increase efficiency, keep bills down and provide good customer service. They largely attribute the collapse in customer trust to others. They see themselves as an easy media whipping boy and the scapegoat of successive governments' unwillingness to explain to the public that the need to modernise and decarbonise the energy industry means higher prices whoever runs it. Some of them now see the competition inquiry as a chance to tell their side of the story. How do we ensure energy security? Most observers agree there is a need for more power stations in this country, be they gas-, nuclear- or wind-powered \u2013 gas plants have been mothballed or closed even as surplus capacity has dwindled. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has spoken of the need for \u00a3100bn of new investment to cope with the coal-fired power stations that are being driven offline by new environmental regulations, or the many nuclear facilities which are coming to the end of their lives. The state-owned CEGB, praised in 1983 by then-parliamentary under secretary of state the Earl of Avon as a \"success story\", could perhaps stand accused of overengineering and overcautiousness. It used to keep many power plants on standby and at one stage had 25% surplus capacity margins. That figure is now down to just 5%, which has led to fears about blackouts. The need to tackle climate change means carbon-intensive oil and coal-fired stations must be phased out unless a largely unproven and expensive system of carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be rapidly introduced. Meanwhile wind, solar and nuclear systems still require heavy subsidies to make them competitive, at a time when the country foresees huge future demand for electricity as it tries to move transport away from petrol-powered to electric cars. And all of this is comes at a time when our own North Sea oil and gas production is in fast decline. But the best way of reducing the scale of the action needed is by reducing demand for power. Energy-efficiency can do this via well-insulated domestic households or less energy-intensive ways of doing business. To frack or not to frack? Hardline environmentalists would rule out shale gas extraction, on the grounds that it would keep Britain dependent on fossil fuels and stifle investment in low-carbon power. But many observers believe locally produced and lower-carbon shale would increase energy security and could be used to buy the time required move away from oil and coal. Successful shale gas exploitation has had a dramatic impact on the energy scene in America, driving down domestic gas prices and triggering a new manufacturing boom. But Britain is at a very early stage, with little knowledge yet about how easy or lucrative it would be to get at the reserves that are believed to lie beneath regions such as Bowland, Lancashire. David Cameron said last week that a shale gas industry could beat off any threat by Vladimir Putin to use Siberian gas as a political weapon. But it could take years to get a UK shale industry running profitably, and even Lord Browne, chairman of shale pioneer Cuadrilla Resources, believes it would have little impact on prices. What about the nuclear option? Nuclear power plants should be able to run at full capacity almost all the time \u2013 unlike wind or solar, which are weather-dependent. A number of new investors have come forward with plans to build new reactors on the sites of existing plants. Hinkley Point C, proposed by EDF in Somerset, would generate 3,200MW, single-handedly supplying almost 7% of the country's electricity. That compares with 630MW of intermittent energy from the world's biggest offshore wind farm, the London Array off the coast of Kent. But EDF has been granted huge subsidies to build the low-carbon plant, which may yet be deemed in breach of competition policy by the European Commission. The building of new reactors in France and Finland is running way over time and budget, and the issue of radioactive waste remains unresolved. Will the lights go out? The list of organisations and business leaders who have warned that Britain is heading for an energy crunch somewhere between now and 2020 is long and distinguished and includes Ofgem, the National Grid and, most recently, Centrica. People have been predicting power failures for more than 10 years, but Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of the British Gas parent group, repeated the warning last week as the CMA inquiry was announced. Ofgem and Ed Davey insist that the competition investigation will make investment easier, because it will come to a clear conclusion about whether the energy companies have been profiteering, and how a market that appears to keep new entrants out \u2013 or at least stop them expanding \u2013 can be restructured. So will there be blackouts this time around? What is more likely is higher prices, as Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at the University of Oxford and a former government adviser, told parliament in 2006: \"People think insecurity of supply means will the lights go off, but that is not the issue. It is what happens just before the lights go off. It is volatility and sharp price rises.\" Even if the big six are found guilty of profiteering and face fines, break-ups or other sanctions, the fact remains that the private sector will not invest in new low-carbon plants without significant subsidies. It is unsustainable to keep loading the cost directly on to consumers through energy bills, as this hits the lowest-paid and most needy. The taxpayer is the obvious candidate to foot more of the bill, but this requires the government to be more open about the challenge ahead, and adjust its spending priorities accordingly.",
