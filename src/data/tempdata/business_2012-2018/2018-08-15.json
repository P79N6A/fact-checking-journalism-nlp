The firm\u2019s penalty for producing an \u201cincomplete, inaccurate and misleading\u201d audit of the 2014 accounts of BHS and its parent, Sir Philip Green\u2019s Taveta Group, was a mere \u00a310m, reduced to \u00a36.5m for a cooperative confession of sins. Read the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s 39-page account of the failings, however, and \u00a36.5m, or 0.8% of PwC\u2019s profits in the UK last year, barely hints at the lack of professional scepticism and the absence of basic checks and controls. Frank Field MP had it right: \u201cThe report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.\u201d The details are astonishing. There\u2019s the fact that Steve Denison, the audit partner who has received a 15-year ban from the profession, recorded only two hours\u2019 work on the audit. The junior manager who did most of the legwork was not told, or did not appreciate, that BHS was about to be sold, which was obviously a critical point when it came to assessing whether the retail chain could survive without the support of Taveta. In the event, PwC and Denison \u201cfailed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate\u201d. They should have concluded there was \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d. And Denison backdated his audit opinion, which is regarded as absolute no-no. It\u2019s quite a tale. How did it happen? The FRC does not attribute causes but the section on how PwC and Denison failed to guard against threats to their objectivity is revealing. That main threat was obvious, or should have been: PwC got \u00a33.3m from consulting work from Taveta in 2014 but only \u00a3355,000 in audit fees. That\u2019s a ratio of 8:1, a clear incentive to be gentle with the audit. In the public company arena, the upper limit for non-audit/audit work has been 0.7:1 since 2016. Taveta and BHS were privately owned companies and the accounts were signed off in 2015 but 8:1 should still have been a neon-lit warning. The FRC says normal safeguards, such as summoning PwC\u2019s ethics partner, were ignored. PwC promises it has boosted its monitoring procedures. In its favour, one could say that the current ugliest member of the big four oligopoly is KPMG, which is in the FRC\u2019s version of special measures after an \u201cunacceptable deterioration\u201d in the quality of its audit work (with the regulator\u2019s verdict on KPMG\u2019s performance at Carillion awaited). All the same, one has to question whether even the pre-discount \u00a310m penalty for PwC remotely reflects the shambles of the BHS audit. The penalty was a record for the FRC \u2013 but that\u2019s not saying much. The Financial Conduct Authority, which is not always regarded as a financial watchdog with bite, is a comparative terrier on the fining front. The stakes have always been lower for auditing firms \u2013 and they are too low. Whatever these firms say about valuing their reputations, it\u2019s too easy for \u00a36.5m to be a mild inconvenience when, as at PwC last year, the firm is making \u00a3822m of profits and the 953 equity partners are earning an average of \u00a3652,000. Self-policing is the first line of defence against bad auditing but it requires real financial incentives. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General, is in the middle of a Treasury-commissioned review of the FRC to make it \u201cfit for the future\u201d. A complete rewiring, or even abolition, of the regulator is possible. But, whatever body emerges, more powers to punish BHS-style audits must be part of the answer. A sum of \u00a36.5m for a high-profile failure is a light tickle for a firm the size of PwC. RBS brand is tarnished Who would have guessed that, eh? Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that required the biggest bailout in history, is the least popular in the land. So says a ranking table compiled by the Competition and Markets Authority as part of its effort to encourage punters to shop around. The exercise is a poor substitute for real competition-enhancing measures, as argued here in the past, but that\u2019s another story. RBS came bottom for both personal and business banking. Yet NatWest \u2013 RBS\u2019s brand in England and Wales \u2013 came mid-table. Is the quality of service higher at NatWest than at RBS in Scotland? One seriously doubts it. Instead, two factors may be at work. First, customers hate branch closures and far more branches of RBS than NatWest are shutting. Second, 100% of the various RBS scandals, including the shocking treatment of small-business customers, attach to the RBS name. The brand is tarnished. It is too late now to go full NatWest, though. That would probably be even more unpopular in Scotland.",

      "bodyText": "The latest wages data from the Bureau of Statistics shows that while things are not getting worse, wages continue to grow at such weak levels that real wages are not budging at all, and it is now more than five years since Australian workers have seen any significant increase in their standard of living. First the good news \u2013 things don\u2019t appear to be getting worse. The latest wages price data for the June quarter has wages for the public and private sector growing by 2.1% in both seasonally adjusted and trend terms. The bottom appears to now be behind us \u2013 with a generally steady if extremely slow improvement since the record lows of 1.9% growth in late 2017 and the early part of last year: The growth remains powered by the public sector \u2013 with that sector\u2019s wages growing by 2.4% over the past 12 months compared to 2.0% for the private sector. But even that weak growth is better than the record low of 1.8% private sector wages growth achieved last year: The other good news is that in the June quarter wages grew the fastest they have in a quarter since March 2014 in seasonally adjusted terms. But that 0.6% growth is a bit of a statistical flub. The original data shows no improvement \u2013 indeed the 0.39% quarterly growth in original terms is the worst ever recorded in a June quarter, and in trend terms the quarterly growth actually slowed from the March quarter: So not surprisingly the government is focussing on the seasonally adjusted figures as they look the best, but that \u201cbest\u201d is a pretty sad state of affairs. Were the past six months of growth to be replicated, we would still be only achieving an annual growth rate of 2.2%. And while due to a bit of rounding up the government can say that the annual growth of 2.14% is equal to the 2.25% annual growth predicted in the May budget for 2018-19, the likelihood of wages growth reaching 2.75% by this time next year remains a rather bold hope: It took two and half years for wages growth to fall from 2.8% in June 2013 to 2.16% in December 2015. The budget would have us believe that we are going to go from 2.14% to 2.75% in 12 months. Three months ago the rather desperate hope was that the strong wages growth was there, but it was just coming via bonuses. In March there was a big jump in wages growth including bonuses \u2013 with the annual rate up to 2.6%, the best since the end of 2014. But alas it was not to last. In June the quarterly growth of wages including bonuses was the second lowest in two years and it meant the annual growth fell to 2.5%: So it is not terrible. But let\u2019s be honest, it is not good either. Annual private sector wages growth of 2.0% is pathetic \u2013 and lower than the 2.1% growth of inflation. Using the more stable trimmed mean measure of underlying inflation that the RBA uses to help guide its decisions on interest rates, we can see that real wages have not grown by any appreciable amount since March 2013: So long have we now had next to no growth in real wages, the very real problem exists that calls by unions and workers for wages growth above inflation will be viewed as excessive. While the average annual wage rate of growth in enterprise bargaining agreements in the March quarter were above that achieved in December last year, they remain very low, and as I have noted previously, because fewer companies are engaging in the EBA process the impact of these better wage rises is becoming more muted: Moreover, as AMP\u2019s Shane Oliver noted, while the next quarter will see a bump from the 3.5% minimum wage rise, that rise is not greatly higher than the 3.3% achieved last year, so the overall impact on annual wage growth will be small. And the bump will be even lower than usual because the September quarter will also see the cut in penalty rates flow through into the figures. The numbers again highlight how disjointed wages growth and unemployment has become. Whereas in the past the current unemployment rate would have seen wages growing by around 3.7%, the current rate of 2.1% looks in keeping with the trend from the end of 2016: The better gauge of when wages should start improving is underemployment: Currently the underemployment rate sits at 8.4%. History suggests we won\u2019t see wages growing at the 2.75% hoped for in the budget until the underemployment rate falls to around 7.7% \u2013 a level it has not been since March 2014. So what to make of the wages figures? Has the corner been turned? Well yes, if by that you mean things are mostly no longer getting worse. The time of falling wages growth looks to be behind us, but we remain a long way from the 2.5% that would be the rate at which over the long run would see real wages stable, and even further away from the Reserve Bank\u2019s 3.5% target. These figures show the lack of real wages growth is continuing. And for a government needing to go to an election by next May, time is running out for it to be able to point to incomes and be able to say that their standard of living is better now than it was when they took office. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

But let\u2019s be honest, it is not good either.</p> <p>Annual private sector wages growth of 2.0% is pathetic \u2013 and lower than the 2.1% growth of inflation.</p> <p>Using the more stable trimmed mean measure of underlying inflation that the RBA uses to help guide its decisions on interest rates, we can see that real wages have not grown by any appreciable amount since March 2013:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Real private sector wage index (June 2002 = 100)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WVi5M/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So long have we now had next to no growth in real wages, the very real problem exists that calls by unions and workers for wages growth above inflation will be viewed as excessive.</p> <p>While the average annual wage rate of growth in enterprise bargaining agreements in the March quarter were above that achieved in December last year, they remain very low, and as I have noted previously, because fewer companies are engaging in the EBA process the impact of these better wage rises is becoming more muted:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wages growth and enterprise bargaining agreements\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yfMM7/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Moreover, as AMP\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaneOliverAMP/status/1029573178459283456\">Shane Oliver noted</a>, while the next quarter will see a bump from the 3.5% minimum wage rise, that rise is not greatly higher than the 3.3% achieved last year, so the overall impact on annual wage growth will be small. And the bump will be even lower than usual because the September quarter will also see the cut in penalty rates flow through into the figures.</p> <p>The numbers again highlight how disjointed wages growth and unemployment has become. Whereas in the past the current unemployment rate would have seen wages growing by around 3.7%, the current rate of 2.1% looks in keeping with the trend from the end of 2016:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Phillips curve - wages and unemployment: 1998-2018\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ecLaE/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The better gauge of when wages should start improving is underemployment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underemployment rate and wage growth: 2003-2018\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/63LLr/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Currently the underemployment rate sits at 8.4%. History suggests we won\u2019t see wages growing at the 2.75% hoped for in the budget until the underemployment rate falls to around 7.7% \u2013 a level it has not been since March 2014.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jun/19/with-unemployment-low-wages-will-start-growing-wont-they\">With unemployment low, wages will start growing \u2013 won't they? | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what to make of the wages figures? Has the corner been turned? Well yes, if by that you mean things are mostly no longer getting worse. The time of falling wages growth looks to be behind us, but we remain a long way from the 2.5% that would be the rate at which over the long run would see real wages stable, and even further away from the Reserve Bank\u2019s 3.5% target.</p> <p>These figures show the lack of real wages growth is continuing.

    "webTitle": "Turkish lira rallies as Qatar invests $15bn, but markets slide - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Qatar has come to Turkey\u2019s aid today, pledging to invest $15bn in the country to help it ride out its currency crisis. The offer came as Turkish president Erdo\u011fan hosted Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, emir of the Gulf state (photos). Analysts believe the move will help Turkey ride out the crisis - with the money committed to helping the financial sector. In the long run, though, many investors are looking for conventional measures such as an interest rate hike. Turkey has escalated the diplomatic row with the US today, by slapping hefty tariffs on American imports. Cars, spirits and beauty products will all become much more expensive, as Ankara retaliates against America\u2019s metals tariffs. Turkey has also taken steps to prevent traders betting against its currency. Financial regulators tightens the rules around foreign exchange derivatives, making it harder to \u2018short\u2019 the lira. After days of heavy losses, the lira has staged a recovery. The currency has gained over 5% today to trade around 6 lira to the US dollar, compared with a record low of 7 earlier this week. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The limits on shorting the Lira taken by Ankara have halted the slide in the currency, which has firmed over 4% after its 20% decline, easing contagion fears and cooling the threat on financials. Whilst this is a short-term measure, its doing the trick for now. However, it was the more confrontational move by Ankara to raise tariffs on American cars, alcohol, cigarettes, escalating tensions with the US that has caught the market\u2019s attention and increased flows into safe havens such as the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc. Financial markets have indeed had a bad day. Shares fell across Europe, and commodity prices were hit by worries over emerging markets - including Turkey and China. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the situation in Turkey: That\u2019s all for today (unless any major news breaks tonight....) Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Political scientist Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute believes Qatar\u2019s help could be crucial for Turkey. He also points out that Ankara stood with Doha during last year\u2019s blockade drama; Erdo\u011fan loyalty then could be paying off now (as explained earlier). With a dull clunk, the copper price has sunk into a bear market. It\u2019s lost 20% of its value since June! Three factors are driving the markets down, says Charlie Robertson of Renaissance Capital -- the buoyant US dollar, America\u2019s trade disputes, and the prospect of US interest rates going up. He says (via Reuters) \u201cIt is dollar strength, Trump\u2019s trade wars and Fed tightening. They are an ugly combination for emerging markets.\u201d Robertson is also cautious about Qatar\u2019s pledge to invest $15bn in Turkey. When will we actually see the money, and will it be invested sensibly? After a rough day, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has sunk to its lowest closing level since 26 April. The blue-chip index shed 113 points to 7497, a loss of 1.5%. Germany\u2019s DAX closed 1.6% lower, while France lost 1.8%. Many developing markets also suffered losses today, which dragged emerging market shares into a bear market. The MSCI\u2019s main EM equities index is down 2% today, and 20% lower than its recent peak in January. Oliver Jones of Capital Economics blames worries about China, rather than Turkey: While there has been comparatively little news on the Sino-US trade war in the past few days, the Chinese activity and credit data released earlier this week were weak. They confirmed that domestic headwinds \u2013 especially the ongoing slowdown in credit growth \u2013 are at least as big a threat to the country\u2019s economy as US protectionism. In our view, these headwinds mean that China\u2019s economy will continue to slow over the rest of this year. And this is a key reason why we think that EM [emerging market] assets will generally continue to struggle, regardless of what happens in Turkey. Countries that rely heavily on trade with China, most of whom are located in Emerging Asia, are probably particularly exposed. Alongside China itself, these countries dominate the main EM equity benchmarks, including the MSCI EM Index. Qatar\u2019s move is a start, but not enough to rescue Turkey, says Mohamed A. El-Erian of financial services giant Allianz. BREAKING: Qatar has agreed to invest $15bn in Turkey, according to Turkish officials. This pledge follows the meeting between Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Ankara today. The money will apparently be \u2018channeled into Turkey\u2019s financial markets and banks\u2019. The lira is strengthening following this announcement, now up 6% at 5.95 lira to the US dollar, from around 6.35 last night. Wall Street is also on the back foot, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping by over 1%. The big picture today is that shares are down, commodity price are taking a hammering, and many currencies are losing ground against the US dollar. France\u2019s CAC index is having a particularly rough time, down 2%, with Germany and Portugal both down 1.8%. Zinc is down over 6%, and oil has lost 2.5%, as traders fret that an emerging markets crisis will hurt growth. David Madden of CMC Markets says dealers are worried about the currency crisis in Turkey, and the cooling of Chinese growth. European banks have lost ground today as investors are concerned the financial problems in Turkey could spread to the eurozone. Natural resource stocks like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Randgold Resources and Glencore are all lower on the session as metals are under severe pressure. Copper, Platinum and Palladium are weaker as traders are concerned the Chinese economy is cooling, and yesterday\u2019s disappointing fixed asset investment and industrial production reports from Beijing confirmed their fears. The renminbi has been steadily losing ground versus the US dollar since March and it\u2019s near its all-time-low, and that sums up the cautious sentiment surrounding China. Bank shares are also having a bad day, as Turkish contagion fears ripple. It\u2019s turning into a rough day in the City of London. The FTSE 100 index of top share is now down 121 points, or 1.6%, at 7490. That\u2019s its lowest level since late April. Mining stocks are still being hit hard , with some natural resource giants down over 5%. The strong dollar is pushing commodity prices down, and there is also concern that global growth could be hit by the Turkish crisis. If emerging market countries are forced to raise interest rates to support their currencies, it could dampen demand. Sterling is also being hurt by the dollar rally. The pound is down half a cent at $1.267, its lowest level in 14 months. Newsflash: Turkey\u2019s president has held talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel. The two leaders agreed to strengthen their bilateral ties, according to Turkish officials. Associated Press has more details: Officials from Erdogan\u2019s office said during their conversation on Wednesday the two leaders confirmed their commitment to maintaining high-level visits and contacts to strengthen cooperation. They said that Turkish Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak would meet with his German counterpart, but did not provide a date. The two also discussed their planned meeting in Berlin at the end of next month, the officials said. Relations between Berlin and Ankara have been strained over the last couple of years. Erdo\u011fan was angered when Germany blocked several rallies in the run-up to last year\u2019s referendum, while Berlin protested when Die Welt reporter Deniz Y\u00fccel was imprisoned - for a year - on propaganda charges. Just in: Photos of the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, conducting his \u2018working visit\u2019 with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan today: A court in Istanbul has decided to release the Honorary Chair of Amnesty International Turkey, Taner Kilic, after more than fourteen months behind bars. Kilic had been detained in June 2017 and charged with membership of a terrorist organisation, which he denies. It\u2019s interesting that he\u2019s being released now -- at a time when Turkey is looking for help and support from other nations. Yesterday, two Greek soldiers who were arrested in March for entering Turkey illegally were released. However, there\u2019s no legal progress on the case of American pastor Andrew Brunson, despite US pressure.... Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International\u2019s new Secretary General, says the organisation is \u201coverjoyed\u201d at the news, and will keep pushing for more detainees to be released. Naidoo explains: Beneath the smiles of joy and relief there will be sorrow, anger and a steely determination. Sorrow for all the things Taner has missed during his cruel incarceration. Anger that the baseless charges against him and the Istanbul 10 have not been dropped. And determination to continue our fight for human rights in Turkey and for the release of all those human rights defenders, journalists and others who have been unjustly jailed in the vicious crackdown. \u201cWe are overjoyed at this news. It has taken us more than a year of campaigning and struggle to get here, but it appears that Taner will finally be freed. Whilst we rejoice at this decision, our celebrations will only truly begin when he is safely back at home in the arms of his wife and daughters. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says investors are nervous over the \u201cgeopolitical back-and-forth between US and Turkey\u201d. Neither side appears ready to back down over recent confrontation that sent the Turkish lira to new lows and raised a spectre of FX contagion across Europe. The turmoil in Turkey is testing stock market morale and sending the US dollar to its highest level since mid-2017, say Dean Popplewell of foreign exchange firm OANDA. U.S Treasuries prices have climbed a tad, while the greenback trades atop its 15-month highs against G20 currency pairs, again putting commodity prices under pressure. In Turkey, President Erdogan implemented an additional tax on a range of U.S imports (autos, tobacco and alcohol), signalling its squabble with the U.S. will continue. Crumbs. Foreign exchange firm International Currency Exchange (ICE) says it ran out of Turkish lira on Tuesday, after a surge in demand. ICE says that orders for Turkish Lira to its UK website www.iceplc.com jumped by 24,000% compared to the average last month. Most of its UK stores have sold out of lira, but you can still get your hands on them at London Luton Airport and Doncaster Airport. This surge in demand indicates that many British tourists have decided to take a last-minute holiday to Turkey, which are much cheaper thanks to the currency crisis. One pound is currently worth 7.7 lira on the international currency exchanges, up from 6 lira at the start of July. Louis Bridger, general manager at ICE, says there has been \u201cunprecented demand\u201d for the lira. We are working closely with our suppliers and the Turkish Central Bank to increase our stock however the demand is so high that it\u2019s unlikely we will be able to sell Turkish Lira online until tomorrow morning. We apologise if any customers are experiencing delays when purchasing their currency. For people travelling to Turkey who are unable to get their hands on Lira, they can take alternative major currencies such as US dollars and Euros which are easily exchangeable when they are out there.\u201d European stock markets have all fallen into the red, as nervous traders pile into the US dollar. In London, the FTSE 100 has slid by 75 points, or 1%, with hefty losses on other markets too Mining shares are leading the selloff in London, with Anglo American shedding 4.5%. They\u2019re suffering from falling commodity prices, with copper and zinc on the slide. That\u2019s partly because the US dollar is rallying, hitting a 14-month high this morning. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, blames anxiety over the Turkish financial crisis: Turkey is nowhere near fixed, so risk appetite is struggling to make a comeback. European stock markets have steadily slipped into the red since the open, also leading a retreat by Wall Street futures. Prospects of a smooth and sustained recovery for emerging market currencies had looked too dicey to Asia-Pacific investors, so markets there mostly fell as well. Turkey\u2019s lira lost all Wednesday gains at one point, following Tuesday\u2019s bounce of more than 8%. It is now firmer again, though clearly volatile. It\u2019s uncertain whether the rebound will be sustained. Comebacks by other currencies that fell sharply in recent days, like the rand, Russia\u2019s rouble and Mexico\u2019s peso, also falter. Turkish trade minister Ruhsar Pekcan says the new tariffs will \u201cprotect the rights of Turkish companies\u201d, as well as retaliating against America\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium Pekcan also insisted Turkey isn\u2019t dependent on the US, saying: The United States is an important trading partner, but it is not our only partner. We have other partners and alternative markets.\u201d (via Turkey\u2019s Anadolu news agency) Hiking tariffs won\u2019t help Turkey tackle its key financial challenge -- to keep servicing its foreign loans. Turkish companies owe almost $300bn in foreign denominated debt. That includes a surge in borrowing by Turkish banks, who have tapped foreign wholesale markets to help fund its credit boom. The slide in the lira in recent weeks has pushed up the cost of refinancing those loans (finding a new lender when an existing debt matures). Jurgen Odenius, Economic Counsellor at PGIM Fixed Income, explains: The root cause of the crisis lies in a leverage-financed domestic demand boom that increased the external financing requirement of Turkey\u2019s corporations, banks, and government to an estimated $229 billion this year. Most of these liabilities fall on the private sector, mainly banks and corporations; the sovereign owes only $11 billion. What makes the problem worse is that the external financing requirement is trending up over the medium term, indicative of a long-standing over-reliance on foreign-funded leverage. As the lira collapses, this lending boom now is undoubtedly grinding to a sudden halt. Foreign financiers, whether they exist as banks or bond investors, are re-assessing the outlook and related repayment prospects. Western European banks from Spain and France are particularly exposed, with over half of the debt owed to them. The trouble is that the Turkish financial system and the corporate sector are short dollars. GAM\u2019s Paul McNamara says the issue is crucial: Turkey\u2019s new swathe of tariffs are going to have a major impact on the cost of US goods. The list, published on the country\u2019s Official Gazette, shows that the levies on some products will more than double. For example: Rice: Tariff more than doubled to 50%, up from 20% Spirits: Tariff more than tripled to 140%, up from 40% Coal: Tariff raised to 14%,from 10% Beauty and make-up products: Tariff doubled to 60%, from 30% Certain types of paper: Tariff doubled to 50%, from 25% Motor cars: Tariff more than tripled to 120%, from 35% Back in Turkey, the government is preparing for show of support from Qatar. The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, left Doha to travel to Ankara for a \u201cworking visit\u201d with president Erdo\u011fan. The Gulf Times says they will discuss bilateral relations between Qatar and Turkey. They will also examine: \u201cmeans of strengthening the existing strategic cooperation between the two countries in various fields, in addition to a number of issues of mutual interest. Turkey and Qatar are close allies. There is a Turkish military base in the Gulf state, and Turkey was quick to send food aid to Qatar when Saudi Arabia imposed a blockade last year. However, the wealthy Gulf state might be reluctant to anger America by providing Ankara with financial aid at this time. Just in: New inflation figures show that Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze continues. The consumer prices index rose by 2.5% in July, up from 2.4% in June - the first year-on-year increase in 2018. The wider retail prices index rose by 3.2%, down from 3.4%, and faster than basic pay (which increased by 2.7% in the last year). Total pay, including bonuses, only rose by 2.4% in the last year. This RPI figure is used to set UK rail fares, so commuters should brace for prices to increase in 2019. Turkish media are reporting that a court has rejected an appeal for the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson. Hurriyet newspaper said the court in Izmir rejected the appeal from Brunson\u2019s lawyer, but that a higher court would review the appeal. If Brunson remains under house arrest, it\u2019s hard to see US-Turkey relations improving.... Economist Jens Bastian fears for Turkey\u2019s financial prospects: Robert Ward of the Economist Intelligence Unit says Turkey needs a \u2018decisive orthodox\u2019 response to the currency crisis (ie, a chunky interest rate hike), rather than tariffs on US goods. Bloomberg has calculated that Turkey\u2019s new tariffs cover around $1bn of US imports. That\u2019s similar to the amount of Turkish steel and aluminium exports that were subjected to higher tariffs by President Donald Trump last week, suggesting this genuinely is a tit-for-tat response. The lira\u2019s recovery comes as Turkey\u2019s financial regulators impose new restrictions on the country\u2019s banks. These rules make it harder for banks to buy and sell foreign exchange derivatives with overseas banks. That will prevent some investors from betting against the lira. Reuters has the details: Turkish banking watchdog BDDK on Wednesday said it is cutting the limit for Turkish banks\u2019 forex swap, spot and forward transactions with foreign banks to 25 percent of a bank\u2019s equity. The BDDK had said on Sunday that the limit would be 50 percent of the bank\u2019s equity. n a statement, the BDDK said the rate will be calculated daily and new transactions will not be performed or renewed until the current excess of the amount is realised at a quarter of a bank\u2019s capital. Paul McNamara, investment director at asset manager GAM, says this squeeze will have helped the lira recover: Investor Martin Enlund points out that it will also make it harder for Turkish investors to protect themselves from the crisis: Boom! Turkey\u2019s currency just dipped back below the psychologically important 6-lira-to-the-dollar mark, as this morning\u2019s rally continues. The Turkish lira has risen by 2.5% in early trading, after Ankara hit the US with fresh tariffs. It\u2019s currently changing hands at below 6.2 lira to the dollar, up from around 6.35 lira last night, extending Tuesday\u2019s recovery. That\u2019s still an extremely weak position compared to four months ago, though, when one dollar was only worth 4 lira. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Turkey has raised the stakes in its diplomatic battle with America by hiking the tariffs on some US goods. Fuat Oktay, the country\u2019s vice-president, says the measures are a retaliation for the US government\u2019s \u201cdeliberate attacks\u201d on the Turkish economy in recent weeks. Under the plan, the tax on US alcohol will be hiked to 140%, the car tariff is going up to 120%, while tariffs on coal, cosmetics and rice are also being raised. Oktay declared on Twitter that Turkey was responding to America\u2019s decision to double the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium. He tweeted: \u201cThe import duties were increased on some products, under the principle of reciprocity, in response to the U.S.administration\u2019s deliberate attacks on our economy,\u201d The move comes a day after president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan announced a boycott on US electrical goods, encouraging Turks to shun iPhones and support local manufacturer Vestel instead. Last night, the White House renewed its calls for Turkey to release the evangelical pastor who has been detained by Turkish authorities on espionage charges since 2016. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters: \u201cThe president has a great deal of frustration on the fact that Pastor Brunson has not been released as well as the fact that other U.S. citizens and employees of diplomatic facilities have not been released.\u201d So with the crisis still swirling, investors around the globe will remain nervous.

Most of these liabilities fall on the private sector, mainly banks and corporations; the sovereign owes only $11 billion. What makes the problem worse is that the external financing requirement is trending up over the medium term, indicative of a long-standing over-reliance on foreign-funded leverage. </p> <p>As the lira collapses, this lending boom now is undoubtedly grinding to a sudden halt. Foreign financiers, whether they exist as banks or bond investors, are re-assessing the outlook and related repayment prospects. Western European banks from Spain and France are particularly exposed, with over half of the debt owed to them.

    "webTitle": "Turkish lira rallies as Qatar makes $15bn loan pledge", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Turkey\u2019s beleagured currency has bounced back from record lows after Qatar pledged to shore up the banking sector\u2019s shaky finances with loans worth $15bn (\u00a311.8bn). A week after a diplomatic spat with the US sent the lira into a tailspin, the agreement with Qatar was calculated to help Turkey avoid having to ask the International Monetary Fund for emergency funding. Officials in Ankara said the Qatari money would be \u201cchanneled into Turkey\u2019s financial markets and banks\u201d, with the implication that the investment would be enough to head off a banking collapse. However, while the investment gave the Turkish lira much-needed respite, the US president Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of further trade sanctions against Ankara, along with concerns about the rising value of the dollar and weak profits in Chinese tech firms, sent global financial markets into reverse. London\u2019s FTSE 100 sank to its lowest closing level since 26 April after the blue-chip index shed 113 points to 7497, a loss of 1.5%. Germany\u2019s DAX closed 1.6% lower, while the Paris-based CAC lost 1.8%. Many developing markets also suffered losses, which dragged emerging market shares into a bear market, usually defined as a decline by a fifth over a few months. The MSCI\u2019s main emerging markets equities index fell 2%, down 20% on its recent peak in January. Some analysts said the rout was likely to continue as the US president pressed ahead with higher trade tariffs on Turkey, China and the European Union. Trump has used his executive powers to impose higher tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars, leading to retaliatory duties on US exports. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, retaliated to the latest US tariffs on Wednesday with higher import duties on US imports, including alcohol, cars and tobacco. Mohamed A El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at the German insurer Allianz, tweeted that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s policies, including the Qatari investment, would act like sticking plaster, leaving the possibility open for an IMF rescue. He said: \u201cThis is part of the Turkish government\u2019s strategy to avoid the IMF by finding alternative external support. To be a sustainable stabilizer, funding needs to be larger and reach the central bank.\u201d However, the lira rallied by 6% after the Qatari pledge and a separate move by Turkey\u2019s central bank to boost the finances of the country\u2019s banks. In an effort to defend the lira, Turkey\u2019s central bank tightened its rules on currency swaps and other foreign exchange transactions, limiting the ability of banks to supply lira to foreign financial companies. Turkey\u2019s trade minister, Ruhsar Pekcan, said: \u201cThe United States is an important trading partner but it is not our only partner. We have other partners and alternative markets.\u201d Peter O\u2019Flanagan, the head of trading at the foreign exchange consultancy Clear Treasury, said: \u201cRestrictions from the Turkish central bank limiting banks\u2019 use of swap lines has had the desired effect on the lira.\u201d Turkey sought to face down the US and currency traders as Erdo\u011fan reportedly received support from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. In a phone conversation the leaders agreed to strengthen bilateral ties and Merkel told Erdo\u011fan the strength of Turkey\u2019s economy was important to Germany, a presidential source told Reuters. In another episode of diplomatic activity, Erdo\u011fan met the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who was on a \u201cworking visit\u201d to see the Turkish president. Erdo\u011fan has accused the US of waging economic war against his country and has vowed not to back down. Ankara more than doubled the tariff on US rice to 50%, increased the US coal tariff to 14% from 10% and more than tripled the tariff on cars to 120%. Erdo\u011fan and Trump are locked in a dispute about the US pastor Andrew Brunson, who was arrested almost two years ago and accused of plotting against the Turkish government. On Wednesday a Turkish court rejected an appeal for Brunson to be released from house arrest and for his travel ban to be lifted but an upper court is yet to rule on the appeal. Some analysts have predicted economic turmoil in Turkey for many months as inflation soared and the lira fell. Like other emerging markets, Turkish companies borrowed heavily in dollars when US interest rates were low, fuelling a consumer boom that is running out as the dollar strengthens.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BHS\u2019s accounts were misleading and featured unrealistic forecasts before Sir Philip Green sold the now collapsed department store chain, according to a report into the role of the retailer\u2019s auditor, PwC. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said BHS\u2019s 2014 accounts were \u201cincomplete, inaccurate and misleading\u201d because they said Taveta, BHS\u2019s owner, would provide it with financial support. But Taveta\u2019s backing only applied while it owned BHS. When the audit was signed in March 2015, BHS was days away from being sold for \u00a31 in a deal that eventually led to its collapse. The watchdog\u2019s report, which was changed after Green objected to its contents, shines a light on BHS\u2019s accounting and the failure of PwC and the firm\u2019s senior audit partner Steve Denison to scrutinise the business. The FRC fined PwC a record \u00a36.5m in June and banned Denison from audit work for 15 years. Denison was also fined a record \u00a3325,000. The FRC said: \u201cThe respondents [PwC and Denison] gave no consideration to how these matters may have impacted BHS\u2019 ability to continue as a going concern. They failed to gather any audit evidence on which to conclude that the going concern assumption was appropriate. Based on the audit evidence obtained, they should have concluded that a material uncertainty existed about BHS Group and BHS\u2019s ability to continue as going concerns.\u201d The FRC said PwC, one of the big four accountants, and Denison failed to test many of the assumptions made by the management of Taveta, Green\u2019s retail empire, about BHS. The assumptions included an estimate that BHS\u2019s like-for-like sales would rise 6.7% in 2015 \u2013 even though its retail sales had fallen 2.6% between 2012 and 2014. BHS management assumed the chain\u2019s annual loss would shrink by \u00a330m in 2015 from \u00a369m the previous year as margins expanded and sales rose. \u201cSuch margin and sales growth were unsupported by audit evidence and should have appeared to the respondents to be unrealistic and require further investigation,\u201d the FRC said. Taveta sold BHS for \u00a31 to the former bankrupt Dominic Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions vehicle on 11 March 2015, two days after PwC signed off BHS\u2019s accounts. The chain collapsed in April 2016 with the loss of 11,000 jobs, leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Taveta tried to block publication of the report, which it said contained defamatory statements based on \u201ca partial and inaccurate view of the facts\u201d. The judge refused its request for an injunction but said the regulator should consider whether publishing the report in its existing form was lawful. The final report did not criticise Green or name any of his management team. Responding to its publication, Taveta said the report was about PwC and Denison and that the FRC had stated no one else was criticised. But it said that, despite revisions since the court case, the report still gave a potentially misleading picture of BHS\u2019s affairs. The FRC failed to reflect the post-sale support Taveta provided to BHS and Taveta\u2019s directors \u201creserve all their rights in respect of the report\u201d, it said. The FRC criticised Denison for being too close to Taveta\u2019s management. It said Denison and PwC failed to guard against a conflict of interest caused by the large amount of non-audit work the firm carried out for Taveta. In 2014 Taveta paid PwC \u00a3355,000 in fees for audit work, which is essential for holding companies to account and ensuring their books are in order. In the same year PwC charged Taveta \u00a33.3m for other services, which \u201crisked inappropriately influencing the respondents\u2019 judgment or behaviour\u201d, the FRC said. In 2014 Denison said: \u201cI continue to receive great feedback from the senior people at my clients (Sir Philip Green and Paul Budge at Arcadia) ... As a result, the incidence of them asking the other firms for help or advice is very limited.\u201d Between 1 January and 9 March 2015 Denison recorded only two hours of work for auditing Taveta\u2019s financial statements, including BHS. An accountant with a year\u2019s post-qualification experience, referred to as B, recorded 29.25 hours and other more junior members of the team recorded 114.6 hours. B did not know BHS was being sold until around the time the accounts were signed off. The FRC said the time recorded by Denison was inadequate. Frank Field MP, the chairman of the work and pensions select committee, who has lobbied for publication of the report, described its contents as devastating. He added: \u201cThe report describes the most incredible example of complacent audit rubber-stamping one could fear to imagine.\u201d He added: \u201cThe FRC has accepted Taveta\u2019s arguments that they were simply \u2018very optimistic\u2019 about BHS\u2019s prospects as a going concern. That sounds like a euphemism of the most preposterous proportions. If Sir Philip and his fellow directors really do believe they had proper evidence that BHS was a going concern, then surely they will be happy to put that evidence in the public domain so that BHS employees, pensioners and creditors can judge for themselves.\u201d Field has written to Green asking him to provide the basis for the \u201cgoing concern\u201d assessment and details of Taveta\u2019s \u201cmanagement assumptions\u201d \u2013 which are the subject of much of the FRC report\u2019s criticisms. PwC said: \u201cWe are sorry that our work fell well below the professional standards expected of us and that we demand of ourselves. This is unacceptable and we agreed the settlement recognising that it is important to learn the necessary lessons. \u201cOur audit methodology was not followed in this instance. We have taken steps to bolster the supervision and review of our audits. We took swift action to enhance our support and monitoring procedures. We have agreed with the FRC to extend these further for an additional period. Whilst the failings did not contribute to the collapse of BHS over one year later, they were serious and this is reflected in the Financial Reporting Council settlement.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House of Fraser has taken its website offline amid multiple complaints from customers about delayed or failed deliveries since the company was bought by Sports Direct late last week. The move came as it emerged that a number of fashion brands that have debts outstanding with House of Fraser, understood to include Karen Millen and Whistles, have been pulling their stock from stores as they negotiate overpayment. The delivery problems come after House of Fraser\u2019s warehouse operator, XPO Logistics, \u201cpaused\u201d processing orders amid a dispute over payment. XPO operates two warehouses in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, and Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, that handle all House of Fraser\u2019s deliveries to customers\u2019 homes as well as to stores. All access to both warehouses has been closed. Alan Costello, a regional organiser for the GMB union that represents workers at the warehouse in Milton Keynes, said staff had been told to down tools on Friday and were still \u201csitting in the canteen playing cards\u201d. The workers were being paid their basic wage but some would be missing out on productivity bonuses. XPO, one of the biggest logistics firms in the UK, is potentially owed millions of pounds, according to the Times, which first revealed problems at the warehouse. The paper said XPO had blocked access to a Sports Direct truck which had attempted to pick up stock from Milton Keynes. XPO is among thousands of suppliers who House of Fraser has written to saying it will not cover money owed ahead of Friday, when Sports Direct bought the business out of administration. In total, suppliers are thought to be owed more than \u00a360m. Some suppliers have taken action as negotiations continued. Jigsaw has removed stock from all 20 stores to which it was a supplier. These brands run concessions in the department store and so own unsold items. Ownership of that stock was not passed to administrators or included in Sports Direct\u2019s purchase. Concessionaires were owed money for stock that had been sold over the previous few months and which was due to be paid on Wednesday if House of Fraser had not gone into administration. Legally, Sports Direct has no obligation to pay suppliers as their debts were part of the administration. Suppliers were not expected to recoup more than 3p in every \u00a31 from the administrators. However, new owners often agree to settle at least some of these debts in the interest of maintaining good relations. A source close to Sports Direct said it was dealing with suppliers on a case by case basis. \u201cXPO is unwilling or unable to get involved with us and that\u2019s hampering our progress and impacting customers\u2019 deliveries \u2026 and potentially putting at risk the rescue operation,\u201d the source said. Ashley was hoping to keep 47 of 59 House of Fraser stores open and had pledged to turn the retailer into the \u201cHarrods of the high street\u201d bringing in more luxury brands. Sports Direct has already begun discussions with landlords about reassignment of leases on House of Fraser stores, which the company has been running under licence from the department store\u2019s administrator. However, competition has already emerged as landlords for 10 to 15 sites were understood to be in discussion with Ashley\u2019s rival Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, who has offered to pay more than House of Fraser currently pays in rent on those sites. Sports Direct said on Wednesday it was \u201ccommitted to creating stability as soon as possible and building exciting plans for the future.\u201d The retailer said it had cut a deal with Massarella Catering Group to continue to run 47 cafes in House of Fraser stores, some of which have been closed since the weekend. Mark Massarella, the managing director of the group, said: \u201cAlthough this does not overcome all the difficulties that we have sustained through the administration of House of Fraser, I am hopeful that we will be able to retain more of our business than we had originally expected.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Higher fuel prices in July pushed up the rate of inflation for the first time this year to put an extra squeeze on household incomes following several months of falling wages growth. The consumer prices index (CPI) rose at an annual rate of 2.5% last month after holding at 2.4% in the previous three months, following a steep rise in annual energy price growth from 8.7% in June to 9.3%. The increase in fuel costs, which have pushed the cost of unleaded petrol above \u00a31.30 a litre in many parts of the country, prompted warnings that inflation would remain well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target for the rest of the year. John Hawksworth, chief economist at the consultancy PwC, said the recent fall in the pound would increase the cost of imports, including fuel, and add pressure on prices for businesses and consumers. He said: \u201cGiven the recent weakness of the pound, inflation may remain sticky at around this rate for the next few months, keeping real wage growth to a minimum.\u201d Earlier this week official figures showed wages growth falling steadily over recent months, from 2.8% in February to 2.4% in June. Hawksworth added: \u201cWith jobs growth also slowing in the latest figures, real household income growth will remain subdued and we expect that this will continue to hold back consumer spending growth to modest levels over the next 12-18 months. \u201cWith Brexit-related uncertainty continuing to weigh on business investment, the UK is likely to remain in the slow lane of global growth for some time to come,\u201d he added. The Office for National Statistics said the retail prices index (RPI), which includes some housing costs, rose at 3.2%, lower that the 3.4% seen in June, but still well above CPI. The figures prompted the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to announce rail fare rises, which are linked to July\u2019s RPI, of 3.2%. Tej Parikh, an economist at the Institute of Directors, an employers group, warned that the rising cost of fuel would feed into higher utility bills, squeezing low and middle income family budgets the most. \u201cThese figures show that the cost-of-living squeeze is not yet a thing of the past. This is likely to weigh down consumer spending, posing fresh problems for embattled high street businesses,\u201d Parikh said. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a pick-up in the cost of recreational goods and services to 3.1%, from 2.4% in June, mostly related to computer games, was another reason for the rise in average prices. \u201cInflation in most other components of core inflation eased, as the boost from sterling\u2019s depreciation continued to wane,\u201d he said. \u201cClothing inflation, for instance, dropped further in July to -0.4%, from 0.4%, indicating that June\u2019s decline wasn\u2019t merely due to retailers starting their summer sales slightly earlier than usual,\u201d he added. Jason Lennard, a senior economist at the National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research, said the institute\u2019s measure of underlying inflation fell by 0.2 percentage points to 1% in the year to July. The measure excludes 5% of the highest and lowest price changes. He said a price war on the high street would bring inflation back down to 2% by the end of the year. \u201cThis measure of core inflation fell in 10 of the 12 regions of the United Kingdom. The fall cannot be explained by the summer sales, as the fraction of goods and services at sales prices was the lowest since 2012. \u201cThe fall is instead explained by more non-sale price decreases and fewer price increases. Based on this analysis, CPI inflation is set to return to the 2% target over the year ahead.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "RBS bankers joked about destroying the US housing market after making millions by trading loans that staff described as \u201ctotal fucking garbage\u201d, according to transcripts released as part of a $4.9bn (\u00a33.8bn) settlement with US prosecutors. Details of internal conversations at the bank emerged just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis, which saw RBS rescued with a \u00a345bn bailout from the UK government. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised RBS over its trade in residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) \u2013 financial instruments underwritten by risky home loans that are cited as pivotal in the global banking crash. It said the bank made \u201cfalse and misleading representations\u201d to investors in order to sell more of the RMBS, which are forecast to result in losses of $55bn to investors. Transcripts published alongside the settlement reveal the attitude among senior bankers at RBS towards some of the products they sold. The bank\u2019s chief credit officer in the US referred to selling investors products backed by \u201ctotal fucking garbage\u201d loans with \u201cfraud [that] was so rampant \u2026 [and] all random\u201d. He added that \u201cthe loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of \u2026 in a data file.\u201d The DoJ said senior RBS executives \u201cshowed little regard for their misconduct and, internally, made light of it\u201d. In one exchange, as the extent of the contagion in the banking industry was becoming clear, RBS\u2019 head trader received a call from a friend who said: \u201c[I\u2019m] sure your parents never imagine[d] they\u2019d raise a son who [would] destroy the housing market in the richest nation on the planet.\u201d He responded: \u201cI take exception to the word \u2018destroy.\u2019 I am more comfortable with \u2018severely damage.\u2019\u201d Another senior banker explained to a colleague that risky loans were the result of a broken mortgage industry that meant lenders were \u201craking in the money\u201d and were incentivised to make as many loans as possible. Employees who might raise the alarm about the riskiness of such lending \u201cdon\u2019t give a shit because they\u2019re not getting paid\u201d, he said. The bank made \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d from selling RMBS, the DoJ said, while disguising the risk they posed to investors, which included a group of nuns who lost 96% of their investment. By October 2007, as signs of stress began to show in the banking system, RBS\u2019 chief credit officer wrote to colleagues expressing his true feelings about the burgeoning volume of subprime loans in the housing market. He said loans were being pushed by \u201cevery possible \u2026 style of scumbag\u201d, adding that it was \u201clike quasi-organised crime\u201d. \u201cNobody seems to care,\u201d he added. The DoJ criticised RBS\u2019 failure to do due diligence on the loans it was packaging, saying the bank feared it would lose out to rivals if it performed stricter tests. One analyst at the lender referred to the bank\u2019s due diligence procedures as \u201cjust a bunch of bullshit\u201d, according to the transcripts. When the bank became concerned about the poor quality of loans and started imposing tighter due diligence, one senior banker complained, saying: \u201cOh, God. Does anyone want to make money around here any more?\u201d RBS expected to make $20m from one deal that involved trading particularly risky loans, but faced resistance from the bank\u2019s chief credit officer. A senior executive responded to the concerns by telling the bank\u2019s head trader: \u201cPlease don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 blow this one. We need every dollar we can get our hands on.\u201d Internal conversations between bankers also offer some insight into their growing realisation of the poor quality of the loans the bank owned and sold. In September 2007, one trader referred to an appraisal of loans as giving \u201cpretty shitty results\u201d. The transcripts were released by the DoJ as it confirmed the details of the settlement with the bank over its trading in RMBS. RBS said: \u201cUnder the terms of the settlement, RBS disputes the allegations but will not set out a legal defence, while the settlement does not constitute a judicial finding.\u201d Certainty over the scale of the settlement will allow the bank to pay its first dividend in a decade this year. The dividend is worth \u00a3240m and the Treasury will receive \u00a3149m as RBS is still 62%-owned by the government. Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said: \u201cThis settlement dates back to the period between 2005 and 2007. There is no place for the sort of unacceptable behaviour alleged by the DoJ at the bank we are building today.\u201d He added that the bank could now \u201cfocus our energy on serving our customers better\u201d. But league tables published by the Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday placed RBS joint bottom for customer service, with fewer than half of customers saying they would recommend the bank to a friend. RBS will have to publish the results in branches, on its website and mobile app from today.",

      "bodyText": "UK house price growth slowed in June to the lowest annual rate in five years, driven by falling prices in London, according to official figures. Average house prices across the country increased 3% in the year to June, down from a 3.5% gain in May, the lowest annual rate since August 2013, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The average price of a UK home was \u00a3228,000 \u2013 about \u00a36,000 higher than in June 2017 and \u00a31,000 higher than in May. However, the slowdown is hitting London hardest. House prices in the capital fell at the fastest annual rate since the depths of the financial crisis, while rents dropped at the fastest rate in eight years, said the ONS. The ONS said the UK-wide dip in growth was driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England. London recorded the weakest reading across the country, with prices dropping 0.7% over the year to June, the lowest rate since September 2009, and down 0.2% in May. It is the fifth month London house prices have fallen this year. The annual UK growth rate has slowed steadily since summer 2016 and has remained below 5% throughout 2017 and 2018, with the exception of October 2017. The second-lowest annual growth was in the north-east, where prices dropped 0.6% in the year to June. Prices are still growing strongly in other areas of the country, led by the West Midlands where prices rose by 5.8%, and the east Midlands with 4.1% annual growth. Semi-detached houses showed the biggest increase, with prices up 4.4% to \u00a3216,000 in the year to June. The average price of flats and maisonettes rose by 0.5% to \u00a3204,000, marking the lowest annual growth of all property types. This was driven by price falls in London, which accounts for a quarter of all UK flats and maisonette sales. The ONS also released data on rents. Private rents rose 0.9% in Britain in the year to July, down slightly from an annual rate of 1% in the 12 months to June. In England, private rents grew by 0.9%, Wales recorded growth of 1% while Scotland experienced a rental price rise of 0.5%. Rents in London fell 0.3%, marking the lowest annual rate since September 2010. Jeremy Leaf, a London estate agent and a former RICS residential chairman, said: \u201cHouse price growth outside of London is being supported by a continuing shortage of stock whereas the capital and the south-east can\u2019t hide behind this excuse any longer. Price drops are continuing and reflect a new realism in the market \u2013 if you want to sell your property, it needs to stand out and price is the obvious way of doing it.\u201d",
