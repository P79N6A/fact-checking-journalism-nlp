      "bodyText": "Business lending by Britain\u2019s banks remains on track to rise in 2015, despite falling sharply in June, according to a new forecast from the EY Item Club. Boosting business investment is seen as an essential factor in restoring Britain\u2019s shaky productivity record and putting the economic recovery on a sustainable footing. But recent official figures showing a \u00a35.5bn decline in outstanding business lending in June raised doubts about whether the financial sector is ready to back the corporate sector. However, EY\u2019s analysis, carried out in conjunction with consultancy Oxford Economics, suggests business lending could still eke out a small rise, of 0.25%, over the year as a whole \u2013 and should continue increasing over the next few years, even with interest rates set to increase. Any rise in business lending would be the first since it peaked at \u00a3575bn in 2008. \u201cConsumer credit finally turned the corner in 2014, and now business lending will hopefully follow suit,\u201d said EY\u2019s UK head of banking and capital markets, Omar Ali. He predicted that while this year\u2019s rise is likely to be small, by 2019 business lending could be 25% above last year\u2019s level. The forecast also suggests business investment will rise at an average annual rate of 6.5% over the next three years. Britain\u2019s banks have been castigated following the crisis for being too willing to lend into frothy property markets, and too cautious about extending loans to firms. EY\u2019s healthcheck of the financial sector, published on Monday, also pointed to an uncertain climate for the insurance sector, which is being forced to adapt to the chancellor\u2019s sweeping changes to the pensions system, as well as an increase in insurance premium tax, and the lacklustre returns available in many financial markets. Mark Robertson, UK head of insurance at EY, said: \u201cDespite improvement in the economic environment for insurance, large sweeping change has hit both the general and life sectors. \u201cWhile some insurers will use this to improve their market position, others will struggle to respond quickly to the changing environment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The starting pistol could be fired on the government sell-off of its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland as soon as this week. Advisers to George Osborne are still deciding whether to recommend to the chancellor that now is the right time to go ahead with the disposal. Speculation about a possible share sale has mounted since RBS published its half-year figures on Thursday, presenting the first opportunity to approach investors about buying shares. The first share sale is likely to be pounced upon by Osborne as evidence that the banking sector is pulling out of its 2008 crisis, when \u00a345bn was ploughed into RBS and \u00a320bn into Lloyds Banking Group to stop them from collapsing. However, Osborne would have to defend the sale \u2013 possibly of between \u00a32bn and \u00a33bn worth of shares \u2013 at a loss to the taxpayer seven years on from the financial crisis. James Leigh-Pemberton, the boss of UK Financial Investments, which looks after the taxpayer stakes in bailout banks, has told Osborne that at least \u00a32bn of RBS can be sold by April. But in a letter at the time of the July budget he gave no timescale. The shares ended the week at 341p, valuing the taxpayer stake at just over \u00a330bn, around \u00a315bn less than the average price paid for them. While 502p is the average price, other sums have also been produced. The shares were bought in three tranches \u2013 the first in December 2008 at 655p, the second in April 2009 at 318p and the bulk at 500p in December 2009. That gives 502p although calculations by UKFI push it down to 441p if fees are included. Osborne has signalled he is keen to start selling off the RBS stake, saying in this year\u2019s Mansion House speech that the loss on the RBS stake would be overridden by profits from the sale of other bailed-out banks, including Lloyds and Northern Rock. The RBS share price has fallen since then on speculation of a share sale. The publication of the RBS half-year results \u2013 showing a loss \u2013 was regarded as a possible opportunity to sell shares, as it contained more detailed disclosure than usual about the string of legal problems facing the bank in the coming months. At the time of the Mansion House speech, Osborne had used a report commissioned from investment bankers at Rothschild to defend the sell-off at a loss. He will now need advice from privatisation advisers Goldman Sachs and UKFI before deciding whether to go ahead. Big shares sales usually avoid high summer because volumes are thin, with many investors taking their holiday. However, Osborne is reportedly keen to start the sale. The advisers will need to decide whether there is enough appetite from big City investors to buy shares. The process would most likely be signalled to the market, just as it was for the sell-off of Lloyds shares two years ago. In 2013, an announcement was made at 4.45pm after the stock market had closed to say investors were being canvassed to buy shares. The deal was completed overnight and announced to the market at 7am the following day. The Lloyds sell-off has led to the government stake falling from 43% to below 15% over two years. Osborne is now facing calls to carry on \u201cdribbling\u201d shares into the market \u2013 a new process adopted this year \u2013 rather than hold on to shares and sell them to retail investors, most likely next year. \u201cI do think it would be an awful lot simpler and less costly to sell the remainder of the shares in the market than execute a retail sale at some fixed discount,\u201d Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, told Reuters. The Lloyds stake has been sold off above the average price paid for it. The Treasury would not comment, nor would UKFI or Goldman Sachs.",

      "bodyText": "A UK tech firm is offering video consultations with doctors via mobile phone, in a bid to repeat the success of British startup apps such as Hailo and Just Eat in which a taxi or a meal is a phone-tap away. With the NHS under growing strain, the Liverpool-based startup, called Dr Now, is targeting its new mobile app at tech-savvy people who do not want to wait for an appointment with a GP, as well as businesses looking to save sickness-related costs. It has recruited 250 doctors so far, led by Dr Andrew Thornber, one of the startup\u2019s four founders, and picked up 300 active users since its \u201csoft launch\u201d (without marketing) on 22 June. The venture charges \u00a34.99 a month for the subscription health service while a one-off consultation costs \u00a329. The company guarantees that the medicines and prescriptions needed by patients will be delivered to their door by the next morning \u2013 or within four hours for customers in central London. Dr Now will jostle for patients with two other recent UK startups, Babylon and PushDoctor, which also offer video consultations with qualified doctors and issue prescriptions, referrals or sick notes within hours. Babylon, which has cut its monthly subscription from \u00a37.99 to \u00a34.99, also sends some diagnostic tests to the home, such as a cholesterol blood test. The startups are following in the footsteps of US services such as Doctor on Demand and MD Live. Babylon was the first such UK venture and now has more than 100,000 patients. It was launched in April 2014 by former Goldman Sachs banker Ali Parsa, who also set up Circle Health. That healthcare firm controversially pulled out of a contract to run a Cambridgeshire hospital in January \u2013 the first privately run hospital in the UK \u2013 causing a storm of protest over the use of private firms in the NHS. Seeking to defuse any criticism over yet another private healthcare startup, Dr Now consultant Savvas Neophytou stresses: \u201cWe are not replacing GPs. All we are doing is providing a solution for today\u2019s go-to society.\u201d The former Panmure Gordon pharmaceuticals analyst, who has a PhD in pharmacology, believes there is enough demand for several players, all of whom aim to plug the gap in primary care caused by an overstretched NHS. All three UK ventures are registered with the Care Quality Commission, an independent healthcare regulator. The vast majority (90%) of GP diagnoses do not rely on a physical examination, Neophytou claims, making video consultations possible \u2013 and far more convenient than a trip to your local GP practice. If Dr Now\u2019s UK-trained, UK-registered doctors cannot help via virtual consultation, they will refer patients to the NHS. Recently, Neophytou\u2019s wife, whom he jokingly describes as a luddite, discovered a rash on her foot \u2013 just as the couple were planning to visit Center Parcs with their three children for their 11th wedding anniversary. So she downloaded the app, had an instant consultation with a doctor and had the medication delivered at home, in time for their trip. Neophytou reels off the stats: one in six people wait more than a week to see a GP. That has led to growing numbers of people going to A&amp;E departments \u2013 more than 20 million a year \u2013 nearly 40% of whom are discharged without any treatment. \u201cMillions of people who go to A&amp;E just needn\u2019t be there,\u201d he says. The NHS was pushed to breaking point last winter when record numbers turned up at A&amp;E departments, prompting other hospital operations to be cancelled. A Citizens Advice report showed that people aged 18-34 are more than twice as likely to go to A&amp;E or an NHS walk-in centre when they cannot see a GP compared with those aged 55 and over. The survey found one in seven people (14%) aged 18-34 and one in 17 (6%) aged 55 or over were unable to see a GP the last time they tried to make an appointment. According to the survey, one in eight (13%) of younger adults did not get any professional help for a health problem when they were unable to see their GP. The British Medical Association says: \u201cNew technologies have great potential to enable the public to manage their health more effectively and lessen some of the unprecedented pressure the NHS is facing from rising patient demand, falling resources and staff shortages. \u201cHowever, remote or recorded consultations with an attached fee have their limitations. Many members of the public will be unable to afford this service and all patients who have serious concerns about their health should physically go and see their doctor. This will always be the best way of assessing someone\u2019s health needs.\u201d The founders of Dr Now, who have ploughed about \u00a3800,000 of their own money into the startup, are so confident of its success that they are already talking to potential partners abroad to roll out the service in places such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. They also have their eyes on Ireland, China, India and north Africa \u2013 targeting countries with large growing middle classes. While catering for individuals who are frustrated with the NHS, even richer pickings can be had from pitching the service to businesses \u2013 persuading them to provide subscriptions as perks to employees so they do not have to take time off work to attend GP appointments. The Dr Now website, which boasts it is the world\u2019s first website to diagnose and deliver medicine, even has a corporate page that lets businesses calculate potential cost savings, based on the number of staff and average salary. It is in discussions with several big pharmaceutical companies. Dr Now\u2019s full launch comes in October, \u201cwhen the nights are drawing in and people are getting coughs and colds\u201d, says Neophytou.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s mortgage borrowers will be warned this week to brace themselves for higher interest rates. On what City of London traders have dubbed \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d, at least two, perhaps three, of the nine members of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee are expected to cast their votes for a rate rise. Confirmed hawks Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, who voted for rate rises throughout the second half of 2014 before changing their minds as inflation plunged to zero earlier this year, have signalled they could soon be ready to see borrowing costs rise. David Miles, another independent monetary policy committee member, whose term is about to end, said in a speech last month it was time to start to bring rates back towards normal levels, from their record low of 0.5%. \u201cThe time to start normalisation is soon; that is not something to shrink from,\u201d he said. Miles will be replaced in September by former hedge fund economist Gertjan Vlieghe. New analysis by estate agency Hamptons suggests that a quarter-point jump in rates could add \u00a320 a month to the average UK mortgage; but wide variations in house prices mean that would translate into \u00a352 a month in London and \u00a311 in the north-east. Thursday is a red letter day for Bank-watchers, because its nine-member MPC will announce their August interest rate decision; publish the minutes of the meeting; and present their latest quarterly forecasts for economic growth and inflation. These three events have previously been held separately; but the bank governor, Mark Carney, has said he wants to end the \u201cdrip feed\u201d of news from Threadneedle Street. Carney, who has signalled that a change in policy could come \u201caround the turn of this year\u201d, will also set out his assessment of the economy on Thursday, at the Bank\u2019s Inflation Report press conference. Ross Walker, chief UK economist at RBS, said this may give the clearest indication of the MPC\u2019s plans: \u201cThe policy discourse relates to the first rate hike of the cycle \u2013 and the first bank rate rise since July 2007 \u2013 so the BoE will presumably want to prepare the ground for any move to avoid any adverse shock to confidence. Among other things, this will entail a carefully managed signalling process via the Inflation Report forecasts.\u201d When interest rates were slashed to 0.5% in March 2009, with the economy reeling from the impact of the global financial crisis, most economists viewed it as an emergency measure that would soon be reversed. However, the weakness of the UK\u2019s economic recovery, the government\u2019s austerity policies, and a series of global headwinds, including the eurozone debt crisis, have prevented the Bank from withdrawing the stimulus. Some economists are starting to fret that ultra-low rates are distorting markets and encouraging consumers to take on too much debt. Official figures showing that GDP growth jumped to 0.7% in the second quarter of this year added to evidence that the economy is strengthening. The MPC is not united behind the need to press ahead with rate rises though. With inflation at zero, Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, said in a recent interview: \u201cThere is no rush to move rates from where they are right now.\u201d Fionnuala Earley, Hamptons\u2019 director of residential research, said her analysis suggests that low inflation and rock-bottom interest rates have helped to keep housing costs affordable in much of the UK, despite rocketing prices in the capital. \u201cIn London and the south-east, house price growth has outstripped wages and the lower costs of living, making it more difficult to buy. In contrast, the regions of the \u2018Northern Powerhouse\u2019 have seen the ability to buy get better and better,\u201d she said. Hampton\u2019s Ability to Buy index, which takes into account wage growth and the cost of essentials as well as mortgage costs, indicates that in many parts of the country, getting on the housing ladder has become slightly easier in recent months. \u201cLower inflation means people have spent less on essentials and this, coupled with higher earnings and lower mortgage rates, means households in most parts of the country were left with more money with which to finance buying a home.\u201d That trend could be reversed if mortgage interest rates start to rise. However, George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, pointed out that Carney has sought to signal an impending rate rise in the past, before being blown off track by the unexpected weakness of the economy. \u201cRemember Mr Carney\u2019s June 2014 Mansion House address where he said, \u2018There\u2019s already great speculation about the exact timing of the first rate hike and this decision is becoming more balanced. It could happen sooner than markets currently expect.\u2019 Within three months, the financial markets had once again put back expectations of the first hike well into the following year,\u201d Buckley warned. Gerard Lyons, economic adviser to Boris Johnson, said: \u201cI would suggest the Bank stays on hold \u2013 inflation is low and higher rates will impact via a stronger pound, and hit hard many living hand to mouth.\u201d This article was amended on 6 August 2015 to clarify an ambiguity in the first paragraph.",

Miles will be replaced in September by former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/30/bank-of-england-mpc-gertjan-vlieghe-scrutiny-treasury\">hedge fund economist Gertjan Vlieghe</a>.</p> <p> New analysis by estate agency Hamptons suggests that a quarter-point jump in rates could add \u00a320 a month to the average UK mortgage; but wide variations in house prices mean that would translate into \u00a352 a month in London and \u00a311 in the north-east. </p> <p>Thursday is a red letter day for Bank-watchers, because its nine-member MPC will announce their August interest rate decision; publish the minutes of the meeting; and present their latest quarterly forecasts for economic growth and inflation. These three events have previously been held separately; but the bank governor, Mark Carney, has said he wants to end the \u201cdrip feed\u201d of news from Threadneedle Street.</p> <p>Carney, who has signalled that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/uk-interest-rate-rise-new-year\">a change in policy could come \u201caround the turn of this year\u201d,</a> will also set out his assessment of the economy on Thursday, at the Bank\u2019s Inflation Report press conference.</p> <p>Ross Walker, chief UK economist at RBS, said this may give the clearest indication of the MPC\u2019s plans: \u201cThe policy discourse relates to the first rate hike of the cycle \u2013 and the first bank rate rise since July 2007 \u2013 so the BoE will presumably want to prepare the ground for any move to avoid any adverse shock to confidence. Among other things, this will entail a carefully managed signalling process via the Inflation Report forecasts.\u201d</p> <p>When interest rates were slashed to 0.5% in March 2009, with the economy reeling from the impact of the global financial crisis, most economists viewed it as an emergency measure that would soon be reversed. However, the weakness of the UK\u2019s economic recovery, the government\u2019s austerity policies, and a series of global headwinds, including the eurozone debt crisis, have prevented the Bank from withdrawing the stimulus.</p> <p>Some economists are starting to fret that ultra-low rates are distorting markets and encouraging consumers to take on too much debt. Official figures <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/28/uk-economy-gdp-growth-07\">showing that GDP growth jumped to 0.7%</a> in the second quarter of this year added to evidence that the economy is strengthening.</p> <p>The MPC is not united behind the need to press ahead with rate rises though. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/14/zero-inflation-falling-food-clothing-prices\">With inflation at zero</a>, Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, said in a recent interview: \u201cThere is no rush to move rates from where they are right now.\u201d</p> <p>Fionnuala Earley, Hamptons\u2019 director of residential research, said her analysis suggests that low inflation and rock-bottom interest rates have helped to keep housing costs affordable in much of the UK, despite rocketing prices in the capital. \u201cIn London and the south-east, house price growth has outstripped wages and the lower costs of living, making it more difficult to buy. In contrast, the regions of the \u2018Northern Powerhouse\u2019 have seen the ability to buy get better and better,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Hampton\u2019s Ability to Buy index, which takes into account wage growth and the cost of essentials as well as mortgage costs, indicates that in many parts of the country, getting on the housing ladder has become slightly easier in recent months. \u201cLower inflation means people have spent less on essentials and this, coupled with higher earnings and lower mortgage rates, means households in most parts of the country were left with more money with which to finance buying a home.\u201d</p> <p>That trend could be reversed if mortgage interest rates start to rise. However, George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, pointed out that Carney has sought to signal an impending rate rise in the past, before being blown off track by the unexpected weakness of the economy. \u201cRemember Mr Carney\u2019s June 2014 Mansion House address where he said, \u2018There\u2019s already great speculation about the exact timing of the first rate hike and this decision is becoming more balanced. It could happen sooner than markets currently expect.\u2019 Within three months, the financial markets had once again put back expectations of the first hike well into the following year,\u201d Buckley warned.</p> <p>Gerard Lyons, economic adviser to Boris Johnson, said: \u201cI would suggest the Bank stays on hold \u2013 inflation is low and higher rates will impact via a stronger pound, and hit hard many living hand to mouth.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 6 August 2015 to clarify an ambiguity in the first paragraph.</li> </ul>",

The windfall highlights how the company has used the Next Directory service to become one of the biggest players in the clothing industry. However, it could also prompt accusations of double standards against its chief executive, Lord Wolfson, a Conservative peer who earlier this year called the living wage \u201cirrelevant\u201d and warned of a squeeze on household incomes since the financial crisis. Next enjoyed record results last year, with pretax profits of \u00a3795m in the 12 months to the end of January, helped by a 12% rise in online sales. Lord Wolfson was paid \u00a34.7m in cash and shares for the performance. The financial results showed 2.7 million shoppers used unsecured credit from Next to make purchases through its online and catalogue business, the vast majority of Next Directory\u2019s 3.6 million shoppers. These customers were billed a \u201cservice charge\u201d at an annual percentage rate of 24.99% if they did not repay the outstanding balance on their Directory account and card by a set date each month. The APR is higher than the typical 18% to 20% interest charged by bank credit cards, despite the fact Next has a default rate of just 1% The interest income accounted for almost a third of the profit Next made on sales to its 2.7 million Directory shoppers, according to the company\u2019s own figures. The amount that Next collects in interest was found in the small print of its accounts. In the year to January it banked \u00a3166.4m, up almost 10% on the previous year\u2019s \u00a3151.8m and \u00a3126.1m in 2011. In contrast, Next wrote off just \u00a324m of customer debt in the year out of a total of \u00a3853m on its books. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cCatalogue credit can turn easily turn into catalogue debts. Paying in instalments costs more than buying outright, and can come with higher interest rates than some credit cards. \u201cLast year, Citizens Advice helped with nearly 55,000 catalogue and mail order debt issues, with many people struggling to keep up repayments. Customers need clear information when signing up for catalogue debt. Directory and catalogue sellers must not push customers to take on credit they often don\u2019t need, and must make sure customers know how much catalogue credit will cost them.\u201d The consumer watchdog Which? said: \u201cSome \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 deals may charge you very high interest rates even if you\u2019re just a single day late in repaying. People should always consider if in-store credit is right for them and think about how they will repay before signing up for an online credit account.\u201d Next said the company offered a \u201ccompetitive rate\u201d of interest and that the \u00a3166.4m did not take into account the cost of running the credit service, such as sending bills and third-party credit checks. A spokesman said: \u201cThis is a competitive rate in the general unsecured debt marketplace. Customers only pay this rate if they have decided not to pay by cash i.e. via a debit or credit card, and their balance is over, at least, one month from receiving their goods.\u201d Next said it uses an \u201cexternal market-leading credit scoring/credit referencing organisation\u201d to decide whether to lend to shoppers and how much to lend them The spokesman said: \u201cAdditionally, Next uses scorecards developed by the third-party credit bureau, to determine the amount of credit a customer is offered. The interest rate is calculated having taken into account the cost of bad debt, account management personnel, account management systems, and the cost of capital invested.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With prominent members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) \u2013 not least the governor \u2013 lining up in recent weeks to talk up the prospect of rate rises at some point in the coming months, this week\u2019s meeting has already sparked another burst of speculation about when the first hike in eight years will happen. Whatever your take on the exact timings of monetary lift-off \u2013 whether you\u2019d opt for August or April \u2013 the far more important issue is the medium-term path of increases that follow. And the nature of that path depends on all manner of things \u2013 not least George Osborne\u2019s fiscal plan. This is, of course, a statement of the screamingly obvious. It\u2019s hardly news that what the Treasury does affects Threadneedle Street and vice versa. Which is why it is surprising that the overall mix of monetary and fiscal policy \u2013 and how the two interact \u2013 is so rarely put under the spotlight. Economic commentary tends to oscillate between focused bouts of fiscal and monetary scrutiny. But the balance between the two? Not so much. The Bank takes account of the fiscal policy being set across town (welcome to the \u201cmonetary reaction function\u201d). In seeking stable inflation, and in order to underpin growth, the theory is that the Bank conditions its monetary stance to take account of the chancellor\u2019s fiscal choices. But external scrutiny of this policy interaction \u2013 assessments of whether the right balance has been struck \u2013 are hindered by a lack of transparency about these assumptions. This is one reason why the recent speech by outgoing MPC member David Miles (to the Resolution Foundation) was an important one. It set out the extent to which fiscal policy will act as a drag on interest rates. In 2018 \u2013 by when, bear in mind, most of the work of austerity is expected to have been done \u2013 Miles calculates that fiscal consolidation will still drag interest rates downwards by more than 0.75% compared to what would otherwise be the case. This is one of the factors explaining the (commonly held) assumption that interest rates will approach a \u201cnew normal\u201d over the next few years that is likely to be about half as high as the 5% that prevailed pre-financial crisis. Even in the second half of the parliament this \u201cfiscal headwind\u201d will still be blowing strong. Some caveats are needed. Miles was at pains to stress that these estimates are his own, not official Bank figures. Nor is it clear what the basis for this calculation is: is the counterfactual no austerity at all? What assumption is made about sterling? We should also note that the Miles figure differs from other calculations in the public domain. When the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) looked at the interaction between the parties\u2019 differing fiscal plans and interest rates it estimated that the Labour and Liberal Democrat fiscal plans would raise the base rate by 0.7 percentage points; whereas Conservative plans would raise them by 0.3 percentage points. In other words, the extra tightening associated with achieving an overall surplus (Conservative) rather than a current budget one (Labour/Lib Dems) created a 0.4 percentage point drag on interest rates. The case for introducing more transparency isn\u2019t mere technocratic trimming. The balance struck between monetary and fiscal policy has big consequences. There are obvious distributional implications (all else equal, mortgage holders win; savers lose). There are ramifications too for the capital allocation process, the current account, and the risk of an asset-bubble. The list goes on: the macro-mix matters. Above all better public understanding of the trade-offs between fiscal and monetary policy will help inform a key macro-policy dilemma of our times. It\u2019s quite likely that we are now closer to the next recession than we are to the financial crisis. And as things stand we are utterly ill-prepared: rockbottom interest rates and high levels of public debt leave us with few (conventional) policy tools. Creating more space for monetary policy to react to a future downturn is vital. Yet doing so precipitously would be hugely counterproductive, risking the very recession that we are seeking to avoid. Monetary and fiscal policy matter greatly in their own right. Looked at in isolation we have robust institutions in place to hold policy-makers to account \u2013 far more so than was the case prior to the Bank gaining its independence and the creation of the OBR. But scrutiny of the overall macroeconomic policy mix? In some ways that\u2019s become more opaque since policy responsibility bifurcated. Securing the right blend of policy over the medium term is what we should be focused on. That requires more visibility of how policy makers think monetary and fiscal policy interact. We now know a little bit more about this than we used to. But in an era defined by big economic uncertainties, which only serve to reinforce the need for policy transparency, wouldn\u2019t it be better if all this was brought out into the open? \u2022 Gavin Kelly is chief executive of Resolution Foundation",

What assumption is made about sterling? </p> <p> We should also note that the Miles figure differs from other calculations in the public domain. When the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) looked at the interaction between the parties\u2019 differing fiscal plans and interest rates it estimated that the Labour and Liberal Democrat fiscal plans would raise the base rate by 0.7 percentage points; whereas Conservative plans would raise them by 0.3 percentage points.</p> <p>In other words, the extra tightening associated with achieving an overall surplus (Conservative) rather than a current budget one (Labour/Lib Dems) created a 0.4 percentage point drag on interest rates.</p> <p>The case for introducing more transparency isn\u2019t mere technocratic trimming. The balance struck between monetary and fiscal policy has big consequences. There are obvious distributional implications (all else equal, mortgage holders win; savers lose). </p> <p>There are ramifications too for the capital allocation process, the current account, and the risk of an asset-bubble. The list goes on: the macro-mix matters.</p> <p>Above all better public understanding of the trade-offs between fiscal and monetary policy will help inform a key macro-policy dilemma of our times. </p> <p>It\u2019s quite likely that we are now closer to the next recession than we are to the financial crisis. And as things stand we are utterly ill-prepared: rockbottom interest rates and high levels of public debt leave us with few (conventional) policy tools. Creating more space for monetary policy to react to a future downturn is vital. Yet doing so precipitously would be hugely counterproductive, risking the very recession that we are seeking to avoid.</p> <p>Monetary and fiscal policy matter greatly in their own right. Looked at in isolation we have robust institutions in place to hold policy-makers to account \u2013 far more so than was the case prior to the Bank gaining its independence and the creation of the OBR. But scrutiny of the overall macroeconomic policy mix? In some ways that\u2019s become more opaque since policy responsibility bifurcated.</p> <p>Securing the right blend of policy over the medium term is what we should be focused on. That requires more visibility of how policy makers think monetary and fiscal policy interact.</p> <p>We now know a little bit more about this than we used to. But in an era defined by big economic uncertainties, which only serve to reinforce the need for policy transparency, wouldn\u2019t it be better if all this was brought out into the open?</p> <p><em>\u2022 Gavin Kelly is chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\">Resolution Foundation</a></em></p>",

Throughout August 2013, speculation about a sale lingered. It took until mid-September for the announcement to be made. It popped up on dealers\u2019 screens around the City at 4.45pm \u2013 just minutes after the stock market closed \u2013 to declare that investors would be asked to buy shares overnight in what is known as an \u201caccelerated book build\u201d. By 7am the next day, 6% of the bank\u2019s shares had been sold. Two years on, the City is playing the same waiting game for RBS.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Look around and it seems pretty obvious that technology has made daily life easier. We can watch almost any film or listen to any song at the press of a button. People pay their bills on their mobile phones. Stressed parents get to dodge trolley tantrums by swapping the supermarket run for online shopping. And let\u2019s not mention all that free online news. But, for all the convenience that new innovations afford us, what if this rise of technology is actually exacerbating inequality? There are certainly some red flags right now. The first warning signs come from financial markets where technology stocks have soared this year. Search engine Google\u2019s shares recently hit a record high of over $700, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world, second only to that other tech giant Apple. The moves have fired up the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and taken it back to the giddy heights of the dotcom bubble 15 years ago. The problem is not rising share prices per se, but rather what they are telling us about the power of shareholders and the consequences in terms of what is left over to be invested in wages and innovation. This question of how the profits of technology trickle down is explored in the recent book iDisrupted by economist Michael Baxter and entrepreneur John Straw. Analysing the economic impact of emerging technologies, they highlight two potential agents for rising inequality. Firstly, patents, and the way they ensure that profits from innovation accrue to larger companies and their owners. \u201cThe existence of patents may mean that the majority of wealth created from innovations boosts the wealth of the very richest in society, but restricts the extent of trickle down,\u201d they write. Secondly, the fact more goods are being offered for free online. The problem with this is that just about the only means left to fund digital products is advertising, a sector where revenues are increasingly dominated by a handful of companies such as Google and Facebook. \u201cWithout the enormous volume of content on the internet, there would be little point in either search or social media,\u201d write Baxter and Straw. \u201cYet the revenue from this content accrues to the companies that provide search and social media, not the producers of content.\u201d Those two trends play out in the very modern context of lawyered-up, patent-hungry tech giants and the emergence of a free online economy. But at their heart lies a very long-standing tie between ownership and profits. Indeed, the challenge of fairly sharing the spoils of growth has risen hand-in-hand with shareholder power, according to the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane. He concludes that companies are paying out too much to shareholders when they should be investing more. Shareholders are also being put before employees, but there is nothing new there, says Haldane, citing an example from almost a century ago involving the carmaker Henry Ford. In a speech published last week, Haldane said: \u201cIn the US in 1919, a case against Henry Ford was brought before the Michigan supreme court by the Dodge brothers, a minority shareholder. They challenged Ford\u2019s decision to reinvest the firm\u2019s profits to expand the business and pay better wages, which they felt contradicted the purposes of the corporation \u2013 maximising shareholder return. The court ruled that Ford owed a duty to his shareholders and ordered him to pay a special dividend.\u201d There are clearly parallels with the modern-day tension between Apple and its activist investor Carl Icahn, who campaigned to encourage the iPhone maker to increase returns to shareholders. The authors of iDisrupted also look to Ford in their argument on the importance of profits trickling down. They cite the carmaker\u2019s doubling of wages at his factory to $5 a day and the oft-disputed claim that his motivation was the hope other manufacturers would follow suit and so the potential number of car buyers would rise. It may be the stuff of myths, but a century later the story provides a neat way of explaining how a rising gap between the few haves and the many have-nots could stop technological advances in their tracks. Baxter and Straw sum this up: \u201cThose who suggest that technology may create a world of extreme inequality may be right, but equally it may be that unless the profits from technology trickle down, pushing up wages and creating demand, then further technological evolution may be impossible. \u201cIf technology leads to more inequality, it may have the effect of suffocating demand from the economy and can become self-destroying, making further technological evolution redundant as only the few could afford it.\u201d They are right to worry about the prospects for innovation just as Haldane is right to worry about investment, whether it is in training, innovation or machinery. You only have to look at the figures on the UK\u2019s woeful productivity performance in recent years. BoE deputy governor Jon Cunliffe underscored these in a recent speech. \u201cIn the 10 years prior to the crisis, growth in the hours worked in the UK economy accounted for 23% of overall economic growth. The mainstay of economic growth, the other 77%, came from growth in productivity,\u201d he said. \u201cSince 2013, only 9% of UK annual economic growth has come from productivity improvement. The remaining 91% has come from the increase in the total hours worked.\u201d For companies that want to thrive, the message is clear. For policymakers looking to solve Britain\u2019s productivity puzzle, there are lessons too. It\u2019s time to ditch the financial engineering and put more into innovation: the swathe of companies using ultra-low interest rates to fund acquisitions would do better to invest in ideas and equipment. And it\u2019s time to claw back power from shareholders: stop pouring money into dividends and instead let employees share some of the gains.",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne has repeatedly promised to fix the roof while the sun is shining, and after official figures last week showed GDP growth picking up sharply in the second quarter, it seemed that the clouds have finally lifted.</p> <p>With the Bank of England\u2019s policymakers due to meet on Thursday, the news that the slowdown in the first quarter was just a blip sent traders scrambling to price in an interest rate rise in the coming months.</p> <p>Official figures showed growth rebounded to 0.7% after the surprisingly weak 0.4% pace in the opening months of this year. There was also sunnier news on living standards: statisticians said GDP per head, which is seen as a better guide to prosperity, was back to its pre-crisis peak.</p> <p>For some on the Bank\u2019s rate setting committee, it will probably feel as if the final hurdle to raising rates has been overcome: any worries about the tepid nature of the recovery can be put to one side, with the first-quarter weakness dismissed as a mere hiccup. So when the nine-strong team gathers this week, we can expect at least two members to vote for a rate rise, most likely committed hawks Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty. They could be joined by departing member David Miles, based on hints in his recent speech.</p> <p>But others on the committee have warned about pulling the interest rate trigger too soon, and governor Mark Carney himself has hinted that nothing will happen until the turn of the year at least.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has repeatedly promised to fix the roof while the sun is shining, and after official figures last week showed GDP growth picking up sharply in the second quarter, it seemed that the clouds have finally lifted. With the Bank of England\u2019s policymakers due to meet on Thursday, the news that the slowdown in the first quarter was just a blip sent traders scrambling to price in an interest rate rise in the coming months. Official figures showed growth rebounded to 0.7% after the surprisingly weak 0.4% pace in the opening months of this year. There was also sunnier news on living standards: statisticians said GDP per head, which is seen as a better guide to prosperity, was back to its pre-crisis peak. For some on the Bank\u2019s rate setting committee, it will probably feel as if the final hurdle to raising rates has been overcome: any worries about the tepid nature of the recovery can be put to one side, with the first-quarter weakness dismissed as a mere hiccup. So when the nine-strong team gathers this week, we can expect at least two members to vote for a rate rise, most likely committed hawks Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty. They could be joined by departing member David Miles, based on hints in his recent speech. But others on the committee have warned about pulling the interest rate trigger too soon, and governor Mark Carney himself has hinted that nothing will happen until the turn of the year at least. Indeed, dig behind the growth headlines and the economic climate doesn\u2019t look quite so warm. First, the economy remains too reliant on the services sector. Construction had another lost quarter of zero growth. And despite government pledges to power a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d, manufacturing actually shrank. So it was left to shops, bankers and hairdressers to drive growth. The outlook for manufacturing is clouded by pressure on exports from a strong pound as well as shaky confidence in key markets. Just as Greece\u2019s debt crisis comes off the boil, China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, is being rocked by tumbling stock markets. Second, the recovery is clearly not being felt equally throughout the economy, or throughout the country. A deep north-south divide remains, youth unemployment continues to outstrip the wider jobless rate and real wages are only just growing again. Third, while welcomed for boosting disposable incomes, inflation at zero can also be taken as a sign of fragility in an economy which is still shaking off the legacy of recession. This no-flation looks likely to be around for a while, given the slide in oil prices and other commodities, and it removes any immediate pressure for the Bank to tighten monetary policy. Finally, the UK still faces massive spending cuts, which come on top of years of austerity already pushed through under the coalition government.

      "bodyText": "When a woman was raped in the apartment complex where Rebecca Pick lived, the Strathclyde University student felt scared \u2013 and angry. The victim had screamed for help but failed to attract the attention of passers-by. \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d says Rebecca, 22, who has recently graduated in marketing and enterprise. \u201cI thought then that we should have some way of being certain that we can get a response.\u201d So, while studying for her finals, Pick came up with the idea of a simple electronic device that uses a mobile phone to alert police to the exact spot of an ongoing attack. It also turns the phone into a recording device that gathers evidence for later use in court. The Personal Guardian, which measures 6cm by 3.5cm and weighs 40 grams, can be attached to a bra strap, belt or other piece of clothing. To activate it, the wearer simply presses the two buttons on either side of the device, which activates their mobile phone. This in turn triggers a call to a monitoring station, where staff will listen to the live recording to hear if an attack is taking place. They will then direct police to the exact location via GPS. While the attack in her apartment complex spurred Pick into action, as an undergraduate she had long been convinced of the need for a security device for female students. The idea crystalised during a stint of work experience at a security company, where she saw how specialist staff authenticated house alarms which had been activated. A recent survey indicated that one-third of female students in Britain had experienced either a sexual assault or unwanted advances while at university. Colleges have recently been criticised for not taking rape and sexual assault complaints seriously enough. Pick\u2019s device originally had one major button but she switched to two, both pressed together, to cut down on false alarms. If the device is activated accidentally, staff at the monitoring station should be able to tell. Says Pick: \u201cThey can tell the difference if you are laughing and giggling or if you are screaming, or if there is a difference in your breathing, like a panic. Once they have authenticated that, they will know it is a real application. They will then give the police all of the information, your GPS location and then the police will be alerted.\u201d A list of friends or family can also be notified that the alarm has been activated. The device is connected to the phone via Bluetooth. The monitoring centre has software that can isolate and magnify specific sounds so they can judge whether there is a scuffle or a conflict, even if the phone is in a bag or pocket. Where problems arise is if the mobile phone runs out of battery or is out of a 25-metre range. Pick secured \u00a360,000 of investment from angel syndicate Gabriel Investments and has produced a 3D-printed prototype. The final product will be neutrally coloured, so it won\u2019t show under clothing. Trials are expected to take place before its October launch. Talks are underway with monitoring stations to provide the service, which will also be available on mainland Europe. The creator envisages a profit by the third year for her company Pick Protection. The device will be free but users will have to pay a \u00a35-\u00a310 monthly charge for the monitoring station service. Although a focus solely on the corporate market would probably prove more lucrative, Pick says her aim has always been to help young women protect themselves, and will thus be targeting university students. She is also pitching the device at companies with workers who operate alone, such as security guards. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that it would be part of your morning routine \u2013 before you go out, you put it on and it just stays with you every day,\u201d she says. \u201cGenerally, everyone knows someone who has had something happen to them. You don\u2019t have to look very far.\u201d Attacks at universities Research indicates that more than one-third of women have suffered from unwanted advances at British universities. A Guardian investigation found that fewer than half of the universities in the Russell Group \u2013 which is made up of 24 high profile institutions \u2013 record all allegations of rapes, sexual assault and sexual harassment reported to them. After the report, scores of students reported allegations of sexual violence at university towns, where Rape Crisis groups say there is a \u201chit-or-miss\u201d approach to dealing with sexual violence. The universities said they invest heavily in services to support students. \u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "bodyText": "Stephen Hester, chief executive of RSA Insurance, has a big week ahead of him. Just how big depends on whether Zurich, the Swiss insurer, approaches him with a bid for the company. Zurich was flushed out last week, revealing to the stock exchange that it was considering a cash offer for RSA. The announcement could prompt rivals to enter the fray while they have the chance. Hester, one of the City\u2019s toughest characters, joined RSA early last year to clear up the mess left by a series of profit warnings and an accounting scandal in Ireland. Before that, he was chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland for five years. At RSA, he has raised \u00a3748m in a rights issue and sold off surplus businesses but has been under pressure to produce speedier results from RSA\u2019s biggest shareholder, Cevian Capital, chaired by former City minister Lord Myners. He also faced a shareholder revolt over his multimillion-pound pay package at RSA\u2019s AGM in May. At a mooted offer price of 550p, his RSA shares would be worth \u00a33.3m. One might think Hester would be happy to sell RSA and move on, but George Osborne ejected him from RBS before his work was complete, so pride may come into it. Expect an uncompromising performance at RSA\u2019s half-year results on Thursday designed to convince shareholders that his plan is achieving results, and to push up any bid from the Swiss. It\u2019s your HSBC wake-up call HSBC is considering leaving Britain to return to Hong Kong because it is so fed up with what it sees as unreasonable costs heaped on the banking sector. Its lobbying has already prompted George Osborne to redraw the bank levy in HSBC\u2019s favour and, arguably, played a part in the removal of Martin Wheatley as chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. HSBC is still in London, but Hong Kong, where its shares are listed, calls the shots on the timing of the bank\u2019s first-half results tomorrow . HSBC will release the numbers to a bleary-eyed City at 5am UK time to comply with Hong Kong rules. Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive, has said there will be no update on any move out of London until the end of the year but given the government\u2019s softer line he is bound to face questions on the subject as well as on market turmoil in China. Standard Chartered, HSBC\u2019s Hong Kong-listed rival, will release its results at the more civilised time of 9.15am on Wednesday. The new chief executive \u2013 Burt Bacharach lookalike Bill Winters \u2013 is unlikely to grumble as much about regulation because he helped devise the ringfence between investment and retail banking that the high street lenders hate so much. Data dump at the Bank Super Thursday and Mega Thursday are just two of the hyperbolic tags used by City economists bracing themselves next week\u2019s combined release of information by the Bank of England. For the first time, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy decision, the minutes of the monetary policy committee and the quarterly inflation report will be released together at noon. Before, they were spread over two weeks, which gave scribblers time to digest each publication but left them guessing until all the information was in. Increasing the frenzy, the Bank has spent the last few weeks preparing people for an imminent interest-rate rise - the first for more than six years. Amid fears of information overload and analysts spontaneously combusting at their desks, Alan Clarke at Scotiabank has written a survival guide for the big day. The first thing to look for, he says, is whether any member of the previously unanimous MPC breaks ranks and votes for an immediate rise. Second, has the Bank lowered its expectations for inflation? Clarke said: \u201cPeople are slightly relieved that the press conference doesn\u2019t start until 12.45. You get a deluge and then a bit of time to absorb the paperwork, so it\u2019s not all bad news. We\u2019ll cope.\u201d And it made booking a holiday in August easier, he added.",

      "body": "<p>Stephen Hester, chief executive of RSA Insurance, has a big week ahead of him. Just how big depends on whether Zurich, the Swiss insurer, approaches him with a bid for the company.</p> <p>Zurich was flushed out last week, revealing to the stock exchange that it was considering a cash offer for RSA. The announcement could prompt rivals to enter the fray while they have the chance.</p> <p>Hester, one of the City\u2019s toughest characters, joined RSA early last year to clear up the mess left by a series of profit warnings and an accounting scandal in Ireland. Before that, he was chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland for five years. At RSA, he has raised \u00a3748m in a rights issue and sold off surplus businesses but has been under pressure to produce speedier results from RSA\u2019s biggest shareholder, Cevian Capital, chaired by former City minister Lord Myners. He also faced a shareholder revolt over his multimillion-pound pay package at RSA\u2019s AGM in May. At a mooted offer price of 550p, his RSA shares would be worth \u00a33.3m.</p> <p>One might think Hester would be happy to sell RSA and move on, but George Osborne ejected him from RBS before his work was complete, so pride may come into it.
