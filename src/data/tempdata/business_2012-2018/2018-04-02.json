      "bodyText": "The passport manufacturer De La Rue is set to announce it will challenge the government over its decision to manufacture new blue British passports in France. The company will formally launch an appeal against the decision to award the \u00a3490m contract to the French-Dutch firm Gemalto on the grounds that it believes it had the best offer on quality and security, though not on price, according to the Financial Times. Gemalto has not yet been formally announced as the winning bidder, but the 10-day standstill period in the tender process \u2013 the mandatory time between the contract being awarded and when it is formally signed with the successful supplier \u2013 is believed to expire on Tuesday. The Home Office has previously said changing the contractor would save UK taxpayers \u00a3120m but the decision has been met with a storm of criticism from Brexit-backing MPs, as well as Labour and trade unions. Confirming that it was starting the process of challenging the Home Office, which awards the contract, De La Rue said in a statement: \u201cBased on our knowledge of the market, it\u2019s our view that ours was the highest quality and technically most secure bid.\u201d While accepting that its tender represented a significant discount on the current price, the company said: \u201cWe can accept that we weren\u2019t the cheapest.\u201d Ministers said the tender process was a \u201crigorous, fair and open competition\u201d and the new passport would be \u201ca high-quality and secure product at the best value for money for our customers and the taxpayer\u201d. Answering an urgent question in the Commons last month, the immigration minister Caroline Nokes said: \u201cThe reality is that in a fair procurement process, we had to look at quality, security and price, and this was the contract that provided the best value on all counts.\u201d De La Rue\u2019s chief executive, Martin Sutherland, has previously expressed outrage at the decision to award the contract to the rival firm, telling the BBC that Theresa May should \u201ccome to my factory and explain to my dedicated workforce why they think this is a sensible decision to offshore the manufacture of a British icon\u201d. He said: \u201cOver the last few months, we have heard ministers happy to come on the media and talk about the new blue passport and the fact that it is an icon of British identity. But now this icon of British identity is going to be manufactured in France.\u201d The former international development secretary Priti Patel, a prominent Brexiter, said at the time of the reports that it was a humiliation that the passports would be made abroad, calling the decision \u201csimply astonishing\u201d. Sir Bill Cash, the chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, said it was \u201csymbolically completely wrong\u201d. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has also called for a rethink. \u201cMinisters have to understand that the cheapest is not necessarily the best,\u201d she told the House of Commons last month. Trade unions have expressed concern about the awarding of the contract and the explanation of procurement rules. Unite\u2019s general secretary, Len McCluskey, said the government should not \u201cattempt to hide behind EU procurement rules\u201d, while the GMB union said ministers were \u201chiding behind bureaucracy instead of standing up for the security of this country and the security of the UK manufacturing sector\u201d. The blue and gold passports will be issued from October 2019, when the \u00a3490m passport contract begins, to British nationals renewing or applying for a new passport. After the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, burgundy passports will continue to be issued but with no reference to the bloc.",

      "bodyText": "The opening salvos of a tariff spat between the US and China that some observers fear could escalate into a full-blown trade war sent jitters through Wall Street on Monday. Stock markets fell after Beijing hit back against Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium with a swath of retaliatory duties on 128 imported American products, including pork and apples. The Dow Jones tumbled by more than 730 points, or 3%, to 23,368 as a selloff swept the New York market but recovered to end the day down 459 points, or 1.9%. The wider S&amp;P 500 index was also down 2.3% and the tech-focused Nasdaq shed 2.74%. The losses were also driven by further falls for Amazon and Facebook as the tech companies face greater scrutiny from Washington. Food exporters were among the worst hit, with meat producer Tyson Foods down 4.6% to $69.82 while Hormel, which makes Spam, and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride took smaller losses. The White House accused China on Monday of distorting global markets and said the country should not target \u201cfairly traded US exports\u201d after Beijing increased tariffs on 128 US products in response to US duties on imports of aluminium and steel. \u201cChina\u2019s subsidisation and continued overcapacity is the root cause of the steel crises,\u201d White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \u201cInstead of targeting fairly traded US exports, China needs to stop its unfair trading practices, which are harming US national security and distorting global markets.\u201d China announced on Sunday that it would implement retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on $3bn in food imports from the US, raising the possibility of a trade war between the two countries. China\u2019s ministry of commerce said it would be \u201csuspending tariff concessions\u201d on 128 US food products. Fresh and dried fruits, almonds, pistachios and wine would be subject to an additional 15% tariff. Eight other items, including frozen pork, would be subject to a 25% tariff. The tariffs would begin on Monday, the ministry said. The tariffs were in line with a list of potential duties on US products released two weeks ago in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium. The US president has also promised to levy 25% on $60bn in annual imports from China. The Beijing ministry said \u201ca large number of people expressed their support\u201d for the measures in order to \u201csafeguard the interests of the country and its industry\u201d. It added that China and the US should resolve issues through negotiation and dialogue. \u201cAs the world\u2019s two largest economies, cooperation is the only correct option.\u201d An editorial in China\u2019s Global Times newspaper warned that America could \u201csay goodbye to the delusion\u201d that China would not retaliate against Trump\u2019s tariffs on aluminium and steel. \u201cEven though China and the US have not publicly said they are in a trade war, the sparks of such a war have already started to fly,\u201d the newspaper said. But analysts say the fact that China\u2019s tariffs do not cover some of the US\u2019s biggest exports to China, such as soybeans, is a sign Beijing wants to avoid an all-out trade war. \u201cThe amount subject to tariff is not big, which shows China is willing to ease the intensity of the trade conflict that was started by the US. Trump gave us a heavy shot, and China is giving a light shot back,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, director of the US research centre at Renmin University in Beijing. China\u2019s economic czar Liu He spoke to the US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, last week over the phone. Mnuchin is reportedly considering a trip to China to continue talks. Still, some in China are calling for stronger retaliatory measures on soybeans and other agricultural products as well as big-ticket US goods such as Boeing aircraft. China, the third largest consumer of US pork, bought $1.1bn in pork products from the US last year, according to the US Meat Export Federation. The state-owned Xinhua news on Monday called Trump\u2019s tariffs a \u201cself-defeating gamble.\u201d The editorial, published in English, said: \u201cThe threatening tariffs, if realized, may hurt China. Yet the damage will be done at the expense of enormous American interests.\u201d US senator Elizabeth Warren said on a three-day visit to China that US policy towards China had been \u201cmisdirected\u201d and she was not afraid of tariffs. \u201cWe told ourselves a happy face story that never fit with the facts. Now US policymakers are starting to look more aggressively at pushing China to open up the markets without demanding a hostage price of access to US technology,\u201d she said on Sunday in Beijing. With US-China ties at a low, analysts say the countries are likely to keep struggling over trade. \u201cEven if this conflict can be eased, it won\u2019t last long. There will be rounds after rounds of trade wars in the future,\u201d said Shi. Additional reporting by Wang Xueying",

China, the third largest consumer of US pork, bought $1.1bn in pork products from the US last year, according to the US Meat Export Federation.</p> \n<p>The state-owned Xinhua news on Monday called Trump\u2019s tariffs a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/02/c_137082377.htm\">self-defeating gamble</a>.\u201d The editorial, published in English, said: \u201cThe threatening tariffs, if realized, may hurt China. Yet the damage will be done at the expense of enormous American interests.\u201d</p> \n<p>US senator Elizabeth Warren said on a three-day visit to China that US policy towards China had been \u201cmisdirected\u201d and she was not afraid of tariffs.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe told ourselves a happy face story that never fit with the facts. Now US policymakers are starting to look more aggressively at pushing China to open up the markets without demanding a hostage price of access to US technology,\u201d she said on Sunday in Beijing.</p> \n<p>With US-China ties at a low, analysts say the countries are likely to keep struggling over trade.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if this conflict can be eased, it won\u2019t last long. There will be rounds after rounds of trade wars in the future,\u201d said Shi.<br></p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Wang </em><em>Xueying</em></p> \n<p></p>",

      "bodyText": "The gloom on Britain\u2019s high streets deepened over the Easter bank holiday weekend as heavy rain in many areas drove people to seek the shelter of shopping centres or simply stay at home. The number of shoppers on UK high streets fell by 9.6% on Good Friday compared with 2017. Saturday was little better, with footfall down 6.9% year-on-year. On Easter Sunday morning, footfall slumped by over 12% in the morning - before better weather lured shoppers out after lunch. But while Sunday\u2019s total footfall ended 1.9% higher, another bout of rain on Monday morning deterred shoppers - high street visitor numbers on Easter Monday was down 13.9% by noon. This weekend had been billed as the most anticipated weekend for retail since Christmas, but Springboard said bad weather in some parts of the country had \u201cdefinitely hit high streets\u201d, and pulled the overall result for all UK shopping destinations down into minus figures. A week ago Springboard predicted that this Easter weekend\u2019s UK retail footfall could end up 2.4% higher than last year\u2019s, though it had said this assumed \u201cnormal weather\u201d. It added that if freezing conditions similar to those caused by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d returned, all bets were off. In the event wet weather sent a chill through the high streets, meaning footfall across all shopping destinations was down 2.4% on Good Friday and 3% lower on Saturday. However, retail parks and shopping centres typically enjoyed better fortunes than they did last year. Diane Wehrle, Springboard\u2019s marketing and insights director, said the rain kept many people away from their local high street shops. But \u201cat the same time, people did go shopping\u201d rather than staying at home and browsing the web. She said the numbers were \u201cgenerally pretty good news for retailers\u201d, many of whom would be quite heartened by the numbers of shoppers out on Good Friday and Holy Saturday. With predictions of snow in some parts of the country for Easter Monday, many retailers will be crossing their fingers and hoping that conditions are not too challenging. Last week it emerged that high street sales had slumped at the fastest rate for early spring in at least five years, as cold and snowy weather kept people away from the shops. Wehrle said of Easter Monday: \u201cIf it starts off dry in the morning, that will shape the day. If people wake up and it\u2019s snowing, that will be it.\u201d It has been a bleak few weeks for many of Britain\u2019s retailers, with last month\u2019s lengthy cold snap heaping added pressure on to firms that were already having to contend with consumers feeling squeezed by weak wage growth and rising inflation. Last week, H&amp;M said price cuts and cold weather were to blame for a slump in profits at the start of the year, and earlier in the month Carpetright signalled it may be considering axing up to a quarter of its 409 UK stores. Meanwhile, the chief executive of Next recently described 2017 as the toughest year in the past 25 years, fashion retailer Ted Baker warned of challenging trading conditions, Moss Bros issued a stark profits warning, B&amp;Q reported falling sales, Mothercare said it remained in talks with its bankers, and New Look\u2019s creditors voted to slim down the struggling fashion retailer. Many retailers had been hoping the Easter weekend would bring some good news as people reinstated shopping trips that they had cancelled because of the freezing conditions, and took advantage of better weather to visit garden centres and DIY stores.",

      "bodyText": "An autonomous robot will be deployed to an offshore oil and gas platform in the North Sea later this year, in a first for the sector. The \u00a34m project\u2019s backers said the move was designed to take humans out of dangerous and dull jobs, and reinvent oil and gas as an industry of the future. Under the pilot scheme, the robot will initially be deployed at the French oil firm Total\u2019s gas plant on Shetland before being sent to join the 120 workers on the company\u2019s Alwyn platform, 440km north-east of Aberdeen. The machine, made by Austrian firm Taurob and supported on the software side by German university TU Darmstadt, will be used for visual inspections and detecting gas leaks. Rebecca Allison, asset integrity solution centre manager at the publicly-funded Oil and Gas Technology Centre, insisted autonomous robots would not be used to cut the wage burden of offshore workers who are paid a premium for working in tough, remote conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s not taking their jobs. It\u2019s giving people the choice to do different jobs. We will still need a human workforce. It\u2019s about allowing people to move into onshore positions,\u201d she said. According to Allison, it will still be cheaper to send a human to a rig rather than a robot. \u201cWe are not saying robots are going to take over in the next six months. This is a long-term investment in the industry,\u201d she explained. The North Sea oil and gas industry has already been hit hard by the oil price slump of 2014-16, and the number employed in the sector fell 4% last year to 300,000. The prospect of an army of robots running Britain\u2019s oil and gas production is a long way off, for now. \u201cThis is not going to happen tomorrow,\u201d Allison said. She believes it will be at least five years until such robots become commonplace offshore. The trial with Total will involve a single robot, to see how it handles the harsh environment and works alongside people. Unlike Daleks, it can manage stairs, though it will need maintenance and plugging in to recharge. Oil and gas production ranked 22nd out of 40 industries based on their probability of being automated in a recent report by the OECD, which found automation will take fewer jobs than previously thought.",
