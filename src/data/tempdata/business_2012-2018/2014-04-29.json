      "bodyText": "Last summer the archbishop of Canterbury proposed that credit unions should be able to use church halls. Now Barclays has arguably gone one better by announcing it will be allowing them to set up shop in its branches \u2013 and they will not have to pay for the privilege. The high street bank is also giving Britain's credit unions free access to its latest mobile payments technology as part of a \u00a31m package of help for the sector, which is seen as offering a vital alternative to expensive payday lenders, loan sharks \u2013 and banks. Credit unions are financial co-operatives, and Barclays said it was pledging the money because they provided a vital service to more than a million people across the country. But some may be surprised that the bank is effectively allowing competitors to use its branches for free, bearing in mind that the established high street players and credit unions are increasingly targeting the same customers. Britain's credit unions have traditionally specialised in loans and savings for the less well-off, but the rules governing the way they operate have been loosened and many are now targeting people of all incomes. More than 20 credit unions offer current accounts that typically come with a debit card and most other features a bank customer would expect, but often do not provide a full online banking service. Some offer cash Isas and a handful have branched out into mortgages. Announcing the new \u00a31m fund, which will be managed by the Toynbee Hall charity, Barclays said it would be opening up space within its branches across the UK \"to provide dedicated community hubs that can be used free of charge by credit unions and other community groups\". The bank added that it would be offering credit unions free infrastructure access to Pingit, Barclays's mobile phone payment service launched in 2012, so they could operate mobile payments without needing to invest in technology. It will also offer support through specialist volunteering.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Boardroom director forced to leave the Co-operative Group", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group faced fresh turmoil after one of its boardroom directors was forced to leave. The lossmaking chain of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies said in a terse two-line statement that Stuart Ramsay had left the board with immediate effect after \"an independent report, and at the request of the board\". Ramsay, one of the 15 representatives of the Co-op regions on the board, is understood to have left after an investigation into leaks of confidential board materials. Co-op, which lost \u00a32.5bn in 2013 after what it described as the most disastrous year in its 150-year history, is known to be using investigators from Kroll to establish the source of leaks.Ramsay's profile on the Co-op Group website describes him as a computer technician and a member of the Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland regional board, one of the seven which are able to elect representatives to the board. The remaining five seats on the board are held by members of the independent co-operatives who own around 22% of the business, including the chair Ursula Lidbetter who runs the Lincolnshire Co-op. Another representative of the regional boards, Munir Malik, has been suspended after it emerged that he had erroneously claimed to be a chartered accountant. The latest upheaval on the board comes before a report by former civil servant Sir Christopher Kelly into events at the Co-op bank before last year's emergency \u00a31.5bn fund raising. His report \u2013 promised this week \u2013 is expected to be followed by ideas from Lord Myners about overhauling the way the UK's largest mutual is run. The Kelly report is looking back as far as the bank's merger with the Britannia Building Society in 2009. Myners, who was chairman of Guardian Media Group until he became City minister during the 2008 banking crisis, is to leave the board next month after just five months following resistance to his plans to reform the Group. He has been leading an effort to overhaul the boardroom structure and the way the eight million members of the Co-op have their voices heard. His ideas are to be put to the Co-op annual meeting on May 17 although Myners has previously said he does think there is much chance of them being supported by the delegates who will attend. A report in the Observer last May led to the resignation of chief executive Euan Sutherland, who branded the Group \"ungovernaable\". Sutherland's temporary stand-in \u2013 Richard Pennycook \u2013 described the 2013 performance as disastrous when it reported \u00a32.5bn of losses earlier this month. At the time the Group blamed \"fundamental failings in management and governance at the group over many years\" for the losses which were caused by the problems inside the bank as well as a write-down in the value of the acquisition of the Somerfield supermarket chain. Sutherland will not take a \u00a31.5m retention bonus but is still in line to receive up to \u00a31.5m of other payments after taking the top job in May last year. Pennycook has also received a \u00a3750,000 retention bonus. The Group has to decide whether to pump another \u00a3100m into the bank, which needs to raise \u00a3400m on top of last year's \u00a31.5bn. If it does not put more cash into the bank then its shareholding will fall to below 30%.",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The Co-operative Group faced fresh turmoil after one of its boardroom directors was forced to leave.</p> <p>The lossmaking chain of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies said in a terse two-line statement that Stuart Ramsay had left the board with immediate effect after \"an independent report, and at the request of the board\".</p> <p>Ramsay, one of the 15 representatives of the Co-op regions on the board, is understood to have left after an investigation into leaks of confidential board materials.</p> <p>Co-op, which lost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/17/co-op-group-loses-billions-failings-in-management\" title=\"\">\u00a32.5bn in 2013 after what it described as the most disastrous year in its 150-year history</a>, is known to be using investigators from Kroll to establish the source of leaks.Ramsay's profile on the <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/Board/\" title=\"\">Co-op Group website</a> describes him as a computer technician and a member of the Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland regional board, one of the seven which are able to elect representatives to the board. The remaining five seats on the board are held by members of the independent co-operatives who own around 22% of the business, including the chair Ursula Lidbetter who runs the Lincolnshire Co-op.</p> <p>Another representative of the regional boards, Munir Malik,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/11/co-operative-group-director-suspended-over-job-claim\" title=\"\"> has been suspended</a> after it emerged that he had erroneously claimed to be a chartered accountant.</p> <p>The latest upheaval on the board comes before a report by former civil servant Sir Christopher Kelly into events at the Co-op bank before last year's emergency \u00a31.5bn fund raising. His report \u2013 promised this week \u2013 is expected to be followed by ideas from Lord Myners about overhauling the way the UK's largest mutual is run. The Kelly report is looking back as far as the bank's merger with the Britannia Building Society in 2009.</p> <p>Myners, who was chairman of Guardian Media Group until he became City minister during the 2008 banking crisis, is to leave the board next month after just five months following resistance to his plans to reform the Group. He has been leading an effort to overhaul the boardroom structure and the way the eight million members of the Co-op have their voices heard. His ideas are to be put to the Co-op annual meeting on May 17 although Myners has previously said he does think there is much chance of them being supported by the delegates who will attend.</p> <p>A report in the Observer last May led to the resignation of chief executive Euan Sutherland, who branded the Group \"ungovernaable\".</p> <p>Sutherland's temporary stand-in \u2013 Richard Pennycook \u2013 described the 2013 performance as disastrous when it reported \u00a32.5bn of losses earlier this month. At the time the Group blamed \"fundamental failings in management and governance at the group over many years\" for the losses which were caused by the problems inside the bank as well as a write-down in the value of the acquisition of the Somerfield supermarket chain.</p> <p>Sutherland will not take a \u00a31.5m retention bonus but is still in line to receive up to \u00a31.5m of other payments after taking the top job in May last year. Pennycook has also received a \u00a3750,000 retention bonus.</p> <p>The Group has to decide whether to pump another \u00a3100m into the bank, which needs to raise \u00a3400m on top of last year's \u00a31.5bn. If it does not put more cash into the bank then its shareholding will fall to below 30%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two former Anglo Irish Bank executives have been spared jaily despite being found guilty of handing out illegal loans from the financial institution at the heart of Ireland's economic collapse. Justice Martin Nolan said it would be wrong to jail Patrick Whelan, the bank's former head of lending in Ireland, and William McAteer, its former chief risk and finance officer, because the then financial regulator failed to warn them about the illegality of their attempt to prop up the bank's share price with a loan scheme. Neither of the men \u2013 who were given community service instead \u2013 made any comment to the media as they left the court in Dublin on Tuesday afternoon. The judge said it would be unjust to impose custodial sentences after Whelan, 52, and McAteer, 63. The pair had faced up to seven years in prison after being convicted of breaking the law by lending tens of millions of euros to 10 investors just months before Anglo Irish imploded. The decision not to send the duo to jail is likely to cause outrage across Ireland given that the Irish taxpayer had to pay more than \u20ac30bn (\u00a324.6bn) to prevent the bank's collapse in late 2008. Propping up Anglo Irish and two other banks accused of reckless conduct pushed the Irish Republic to the edge of bankruptcy and forced the previous government to seek a \u20ac67.5bn (\u00a355bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the European commission and the European Central Bank. In a pointed reference to Ireland's financial watchdog at the time, the judge told the court: \"I find it incredible that red lights did not go off somewhere in the regulator's office.\" During the trial lawyers for Whelan and McAteer said both men did not know they were doing anything illegal in relation to a loan to the Maple 10 group of investors in the summer of 2008, and believed they had been given the legal green light for the deal from the regulator. Brendan Grehan, Whelan's senior counsel, said: \"[The banker] didn't for one moment think he was involving himself in something that was unlawful, something that would find himself before a court on indictment.\" Patrick Gageby, for McAteer, said there were no malign intention on the part of his client, unlike many other white collar crimes which were committed from \"a base motive\".

      "bodyText": "That's all for tonight. Here's a quick mini-summary. In Ireland, the two men convicted of making illegal loans in the run-up to the collapse of Anglo Irish bank have avoided prison, and been told they'll probably receive community service sentences instead. The Judge handling the case said it would be \"incredibly unfair\" to jail them, given the regulators' failings over a case that gripped Ireland. Pat Whelan and William McAteer could have been jailed for five years, after being convicted of providing unlawful assistance to Anglo investors, in a high-profile trial at Dublin's criminal courts. The news broke this afternoon, with judge Martin Nolan telling the court: \"It would be incredibly unjust to impose custodial sentences. \"I find it incredible that red lights did not go off somewhere in the Regulators office.\u201d Judge Nolan's decision means no Irish bankers have been jailed over the event that led to the country's deeply painful financial crisis, and forced Dublin into a \u20ac90bn bailout and years of painful austerity. Earlier..... The British economy is growing at its fastest annual pace since 2007, after GDP rose by 0.8% in the first three months of this year. Full coverage starts here. The government claimed that a broad-based recovery is underway, while economists declared that the UK is currently enjoying a 'Goldilocks' phase of steady growth and calm inflation. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, though, warned Britain needs an economy 'built to last'. The Bank of England has published details of its new stress tests. British banks must prove they can handle a crisis in which house prices crash, interest rates are hiked and the jobless rate soars. Back tomorrow. Cheers. GW And here's a photo of the moment the two Anglo Irish executives left court this afternoon: And here's Henry McDonald, our Ireland Correspondent, on the news that the Anglo Irish execs convicted of illegal lending in the run-up to Ireland's financial crash will definitely not be imprisoned: The Irish State has lost the battle to jail bankers blamed for the biggest financial collapse in the country's history which nearly bankrupted the entire Republic. A judge at the Anglo Irish Bank trial ruled on Tuesday afternoon that it would be unjust to imprison two senior executives at the now defunct institution even the pair were found guilty of illegally lending tens of millions of euros to ten rich investors just months before it went bankrupt. Mr Justice Martin Nolan concluded it would be unfair to jail ex-Anglo Irish Bank executives William McAteer and Pat Whelen despite them now being convicted criminals because the country's financial regulator had failed to alert the bankers that their loan scheme to the so called Maple 10 in the summer of 2008 was illegal. In his judgement in court number 19 of the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court the judge said he would decide in July if the two men had to carry out community service for their crimes. Neither men made any comment to the media as they left the court this afternoon. But the decision not to send the duo to jail will cause national outrage across Ireland given that the Irish taxpayer had to pay out more than \u20ac30 billion to prevent the bank's complete collapse in late 2008. Paying for Anglo Irish's reckless lending - mainly to property speculators - alongside two other pillar banks pushed the Irish Republic to the edge of national bankruptcy and forced the previous government to seek a bail out from the IMF and European Central Bank. In a pointed reference to the Republic's Financial Regulator at the time, the judge told the court: \"It would be incredibly unjust to impose custodial sentences...I find it incredible that red lights did not go off somewhere in the Regulator's office.\" Barristers for the two men argued in the case that both bankers did not know they were doing anything illegal in relation to the Maple 10 loan. The pair's legal team insisted the men believed they had been given the legal green light for the deal from the state's Financial Regulator. Brendan Grehan Senior Counsel, for Whelan said his client \u201cdidn\u2019t for one moment think he was involving himself in something that was unlawful, something that would find himself before a court on indictment.\u201d Meanwhile Patrick Gageby Senior Counsel, for McAteer, said that this was a case in which there were no malign intention on the part of his client, unlike many other white collar crimes which are committed from \u201ca base motive\u201d Whelan and McAteer's onvictions followed the acquittal of former chairman Sean FitzPatrick, who walked free from court after being cleared of 16 similar charges. All three had denied the charges throughout 43 days of hearings in front of a jury. The trial focussed on a deal to try and reduce the influence of Ireland's one time richest man Sean Quinn who held millions on future shares in the bank. In the summer of 2008 the Anglo Irish Bank tried to sell on Quinn's control of those shares to the ten wealthy investors, which the jury found in the case of both McAteer and Whelan was a wholly illegal transaction. The loans to the Maple 10 were designed to prop up the bank's share price as it faced financial meltdown amid the global economic crisis. Today's court ruling means no Irish banker has yet been jailed over the events that brought its financial system crashing down and forced Ireland to take a \u20ac90bn bailout. Here's some instant reaction: The two former executives of Anglo Irish bank have now left the court, after hearing that they'll not be jailed: Breaking: The two bankers convicted over the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank have avoided being jailed. Patrick Whelan and William McAteer, who could have received five year's imprisonment each, were told this afternoon that they will serve community service instead. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: The Judge at the Anglo Irish Bank trial has ruled that two defendants found guilty of illegal lending to ten investors should not go to jail. Two weeks ago, Whelan and McAteer were found guilty of making illegal loans to a group of investors called the Maple 10 in summer 2008, in the run-up to the bank's failure, prompting a \u20ac30bn bailout from the Irish taxpayer. According to the Irish Independent, the judge hearing the case argued it would be unfair to jail the pair, given that Ireland's state regulator had also blundered. Judge Martin Nolan apparently told the court: \"It would be incredibly unjust to impose custodial sentences. \"I find it incredible that red lights did not go off somewhere in the Regulators office.\u201d Whelan and McAteer will now be be assessed for community service, and are due back in court at the end of July. The spread between UK and German government bond yields has hit its highest level since autumn 1998. 10-year UK gilts are changing hands at a yield (or interest rate) of 2.71% this afternoon (up from 2.67% yesterday), while the equivalent Bund yield is just 1.5% (little changed) according to Reuters data. That's the biggest spread between safe-haven bunds and gilts since the second year of the Blair government. So why has the difference widened? Well, money is generally flowing out of bonds and into shares today (the main stock markets are all up). Yields go up as bond prices fall, as investors demand a bigger return. But Germany's lacklustre inflation rate has made Bunds a more attractive investment, so they're outperforming the bond market. Back in 2011, UK chancellor George Osborne proudly boasted that Britain's bond yields were below Germany's, as this chart shows: That was during the height of the debt crisis, though. Today, rising yields are a sign of confidence in Britain's economic recovery - and that the Bank of England is going to start normalising monetary policy if the recovery keeps up. Another sign that Greece's economy is, slowly, inching back to normality. Moody's has raised its outlook on the Greek banking sector to stable, from negative. After some very unstable years, Moody's sees Greek GDP rising by 0.3% this year -- meaning the six-year recession would finally be over - driven by tourism and exports. In the eurozone, the German inflation rate rose to 1.1% annually this month, up from the 0.9% in March. That suggests that the euro area inflation rate will pick up from the record low of 0.5% hit last month, when it is announced tomorrow. However, the German rate is below analyst forecasts -- ING's Carsten Brzeski says it will give the European Central Bank a 'headache' over whether to act to head off deflationary fears. Here's Jill's full story on the UK bank stress tests: Bank of England to subject biggest UK banks to extreme stress test Interesting developments at Barclays -- Skip McGee, the boss of Barclays Americas, is stepping down. McGee, who ran Lehman Brothers' investment arm (before Barclays snapped it up in the dramatic days of Autumn 2008), will leave the bank tomorrow. Barclays blames the departure on the need to change Barclay's corporate structure to meet the demands of the Dodd-Frank Act. Another possibility is that the departure is tied up with the new strategy which Barclays chief Antony Jenkins will announce next week. As Skip* skips off, he'll be replaced by Barclays Global Head of Client Capital Management, Joe Gold. Another deliciously named Barclays banker, after Bob Diamond and Rich Ricci.... * - or Hugh (Skip) McGee III to his friends The bleak scenario outlined in today's Bank of England stress tests has only been matched once in recent UK history, after the First World War, says our City editor Jill Treanor. From the Bank, she writes: The Bank of England is to subject the UK\u2019s biggest banks and building societies to a series of stringent tests to see if they are strong enough to withstand the shock of a 35% crash in house prices, along with a jump in interest rates to 4% and soaring unemployment. Policymakers in Threadneedle Street will stress-test the UK\u2019s eight largest financial firms with a set of hypothetical scenarios over a three year period between 2014 and 2016. The exercise will assume that house prices fall back to levels last seen in 2002, unemployment would soar to 12% and interest rates jump from their record low of 0.5% to 4%. As a comparison, house prices fell by around 20% during the recent crisis and have never fallen by 35% in the past. Under the scenario, which the Bank stresses is not a forecast, the economic downturn that occurred following the banking crisis would be followed by another severe downturn. \u201cA culmulative contraction in activity to that implied by the stress scenario or larger has happened only in a single episode over the past 150 years \u2013 and that was in the immediate aftermath of the first world war,\u201d the Bank of England said. We'll have Jill's full story online soon. Details of the stress tests are online on the Bank's website. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, insists that it's \"highly unlikely\" that Britain will suffer the toxic mix of blows outlined in today's stress tests (so that's a relief). It's vital, though, that the banks are strong enough to support the recovery, rather than being first in the queue for help when the economy sours. Or, in Central Banker speak: Although the events depicted in this stress-test scenario are extreme, and thus highly unlikely to transpire, by bringing together the microprudential standards for banks with a macroprudential assessment of the tail risks to which they must be resilient, the Bank is working to ensure that the UK financial system remains one that absorbs rather than amplifies shocks. Breaking: Britain's biggest banks must show that they have the resources to cope with a massive house price crash, a collapse in the value of sterling, a surge in unemployment and another deep recession. The Bank of England has released details of the stress tests that Britain's eight biggest banks must pass to show they are resilient enough to survive another crisis. The Bank's crisis scenario includes: a 35% plunge in house prices, and a 30% tumble in the value of commercial property - much deeper than in the last recession A surge in the unemployment rate to 12% -- from under 7% today. Interest rates being hiked towards 4%, up from the record low of 0.5% today A sterling crisis, with the pound losing nearly a third of its value in the first year And a 3.5% tumble in GDP - which would wipe out all the growth in the last year, and more Banks that fail the test must raise fresh capital from the financial markets....and the BoE could insist on capital increases even if banks pass. Reaction, and more details, to follow.... Over in parliament, George Osborne is in good spirits at Treasury questions. The chancellor told MPs that the government's economic plan is delivering stability, and it is also delivering the jobs and growth that everyone wants to see. Labour MPs are challenging Osborne over the cost of living crisis, after years in which wages lagged inflation. Osborne replies that the only way to raise the living standards of the UK people is if the economy is growing and jobs are being created. He's also baiting Ed Balls, who has apparently denied being too pessimistic about the UK economy in recent years. Chris Giles, the FT's economics editor, has tweeted a graph suggesting that UK production sector won't hit its pre-crisis peak until early 2019! Construction output should hit this milestone at the end of 2016 (assuming current trends continues, of course....) Geraint Johnes, director at The Work Foundation, says the 1.3% rise in UK manufacturing output last quarter suggests that the economy is both recovering and rebalancing. But he also warns Britain still suffers from an 'underemployment' problem . Here's his take: \u201cManufacturing grew by 1.3% over the quarter, and by 3.5% over the year. This is clearly good news in that it addresses concerns that the UK had, before the recession, become over-reliant on services. \u201cThe evidence that this recovery is spatially uneven suggests that the very encouraging aggregate statistics may serve to conceal what is, in reality, a much more nuanced picture. The data on underemployment, released by the Work Foundation, likewise suggest that the impact of output growth on the labour market is very different to \u2013 and less comforting than - what we have experienced in the past. Nevertheless these most recent data offer much hope that the economy is indeed recovering.\u201d That new data shows that 9% of Britain's adults are under-employed, rising to 28.3% among young workers. More details on underemployment here. Unless Britain suffers a very nasty shock imminently, the nation's economy should finally climb above its pre-crisis peak by the summer (last quarter's growth means it's just 0.6% away) The Treasury will be getting the bunting ready, and the PM will probably tweet about the #LongTermEconomicPlan succeeding. It's a welcome milestone, especially with the main sectors fo the economy all growing. As economic editor Larry Elliott puts it: It has, in all honesty, been a long time coming. The recession was deep and the recovery \u2013 until the last 12 months \u2013 painfully slow. Slower even than after the Great Depression of the 1930s. But there is now growth across virtually the whole economy. Most of the expansion between January and March was accounted for by services, in part because services make up almost four fifths of the economy and in part because parts of the service sector \u2013 housing, retailing, business services \u2013 all performed strongly. Construction was a tad weaker than expected, with the 0.3% growth perhaps suggesting that increased demand for property has yet to feed through into higher house building This chart reinforces the point that Britain's service sector has outperformed the rest of the economy since the great recession. Services, and agriculture, are the only sectors to have climbed above 2010 production levels. That's from page 5 of today's GDP report. The CBI is optimistic about UK growth prospects this year, reckoning that businesses and consumers are growing in confidence: Katja Hall, CBI chief policy director, said: \u201cGrowth in the first quarter was mostly driven by the service sector [see here], but we\u2019re also seeing our industrial base playing an important role in the recovery, with manufacturing output rising steadily. \u201cWe expect economic momentum to be maintained throughout the year with a broader-based recovery as business investment takes off.\u201d Shadow chancellor Ed Balls just appeared on BBC News 24, warning that many people in Britain are not feeling the benefits in the recovery. Asked whether he welcomed the news that growth was picking up, Balls replies \"Yes, and it's about time\", before insisting that Britain needs a recovery that is 'built to last' and tackles the cost of living crisis. Quite a testy exchange - BBC presenter Simon McCoy accused Balls of grumpiness at one point. Here's Balls' official response: \u201cNow that growth has finally returned, the question is whether ordinary working people will properly feel the benefit and we have a balanced recovery that\u2019s built to last. \u201cDavid Cameron and George Osborne want to tell people the cost-of-living crisis is over, but millions of hardworking people are still feeling no recovery at all. \u201cUnder this government, wages after inflation are down by over \u00a31,600 a year. On top of this, tax and benefit changes will leave families almost \u00a31,000 a year worse off by the time of the next election. \u201cAnd with business investment still weak, infrastructure output down and housing demand outstripping housing supply, this is not yet a recovery that is built to last. \u201cLabour\u2019s plan will ensure we earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top, and secure a strong and balanced recovery that is built to last. Balls adds that the next Labour government would freeze energy bills, reform the banks, cut business rates, build 200,000 new homes a year and expand free childcare to make work pay, and raise the top rate income tax back to 50p. Conservative party spinners have waded in too: The 1.3% rise in manufacturing output last quarter suggests the UK is benefitting from the recent pick-up in economic conditions in Europe. Berenberg's Dr Christian Schulz reckons: In a sign that the beginning recovery in the Eurozone, the UK\u2019s single most important export market, is helping the UK as well, the export-oriented manufacturing sector was the best performer of all sectors in Q1. This chart shows how manufacturing output has picked up in the last four quarters: Aengus Collins, UK Analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, is also in the Goldilocks camp, saying: George Osborne will be happy with this morning's estimate that GDP increased by 0.8% quarter on quarter in the first three months of the year. It builds on the momentum developed last year, but without accelerating as rapidly as some official and private-sector analysts had forecast. However.... The economy remains vulnerable to the next cyclical downturn when it arrives James Knightley of ING reckons the UK economy will grow by 3% this year. That would beat other G7 economies -- indeed, New Zealand is the only developed economy that could do better, he predicts. Given New Zealand has already started to tighten monetary policy [interest rates went up last week], this underlines our point that the risks remain skewed towards earlier Bank of England policy tightening than the second quarter of 2015, the point currently pencilled in by financial markets. Skimming through my inbox, several economists are pointing out that today's GDP estimate is only based on around 40% of the total economic data, and includes many assumptions and extrapolations. This means the growth rate could be revised up in a few weeks, they say. This argument is particularly popular with economists who had forecast a growth rate of 0.9% or higher.... Better late than never? That's the message from the TUC today, which chides George Osborne for snuffing out the recovery in 2010 with an austerity package that knocked the economy off course. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady also urged the Bank of England not to tighten monetary policy yet: \u201cThis is the kind of growth we could have seen two or three years ago if the government had not choked off recovery through cuts, austerity and wage freezes. \u201cBut however welcome these figures are the economy remains below its 2008 peak and most people have yet to see much benefit from growth. Pay and job prospects are still below pre-crash levels, and there will need to be many more years of figures like today\u2019s, before ordinary families recover lost ground. \u201cThe worst possible conclusion from today is to believe that the recovery is now strong enough to survive higher interest rates.\u201d Here's our story on this morning's growth figures, by Katie Allen: UK economy grew by 0.8% in first three months of 2014 Reaction is flooding in, with two economists declaring that Britain's economy has reached its Goldilocks moment -- not too hot, and not too cold. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, reckons the recovery looks sustainable with business investment and consumer incomes rising at long last. \u201cThe UK economy is in the sweet spot of the economic cycle, with growth powering ahead of our major competitors and inflation falling away. Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics, agrees that Britain is enjoying \" solid, but not excessive, growth\", but cautions that the recovery may not be sustainable yet. The breakdown by output showed solid quarterly rises in both industrial production (+0.8%) and services output (+0.9%), though construction was soft at +0.3%. We don\u2019t have the expenditure breakdown yet, though the retail sales figures suggest that the recovery remains heavily dependent on consumer spending. Britain's production sector is still 10% smaller than before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but the service sector has clawed back all the activity lost in the great recession. ONS chief economist Joe Grice explains: \"This is the fifth consecutive quarter of steady growth. Overall, the economy is now only 0.6% below the pre-recession peak at the beginning of 2008. \u201cIn fact, services are now 2% above the pre-recession peak but the production and construction sectors are still around 12% lower.\" The task of rebalancing Britain's economy remains unresolved.... George Osborne may indeed spy the foundations of a broad-based recovery (see here), but Britain is still relying on the services sector for most of its growth. This chart shows that Services (which grew by +0.9% in the quarter) provided almost all of the 0.8% increase in UK GDP in the last quarter. The prime minister has rolled out his favourite Twitter hashtag: So, UK economic growth did pick up pace in the early months of this year. 0.8% growth is a small acceleration on the 0.7% expansion recorded in October-December, and matches the growth seen last summer when the recovery finally kicked off. But it's still a little shy of the 0.9% which the City had expected. You can see the ONS's preliminary estimate of UK GDP online, here (pdf). George Osborne was quick to hail today's growth figures as proof that \"the foundations for a broad-based recovery\" is underway. Here's the chancellor's reaction to the news that UK GDP increased by 0.8% in the last quarter: \"Today's figures show that Britain is coming back - but we can't take that for granted. We have to carry on working through our long term economic plan.For the first time in a decade all three main sectors of the economy - manufacturing, services and construction - have grown by at least three per cent over the last year. The impact of the Great Recession is still being felt, but the foundations for a broad based recovery are now in place. The biggest risk to economic security would be abandoning the plan that is laying those foundations.\" It was a strong quarter for manufacturing -- with output rising by 1.3% during the quarter. The March of the Makers picked up pace. The wider measure of production output was dragged down by a drop in agricultural output (-0.7%) and a 2% drop in activity across the energy sector. The UK economy is still 0.6% below its pre-crisis peak in 2008, after the 0.8% rise in output in the first three months of the year. If you exclude oil and gas output, though, it's actually 0.3% higher. Britain's dominant service sector grew by 0.9% during the quarter. Industrial output rose by 0.8%, and construction output brought up the rear at +0.3% quarter-on-quarter. The UK economy has grown by 3.1% over the last year, the ONS says. That's the strongest year-on-year change in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2007, after the near-collapse of Northern Rock. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.8% in the first three months of 2014 - slightly below forecasts, but still showing solid growth. Two minutes to go until the ONS announces how well, or badly, the UK performed in the first three months.... In the City, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies has hit a seven-week high this morning, up 0.4% at 6727 points. It's being driven by takeover rumours -- UK pharmaceuticals firm Shire (+3.1%) is apparently being eyed up by Allergan, the firm behind Botox. AstraZeneca, which is fighting off the advances of viagra-maker Pfizer, has dipped 1.4% this morning after surging 14% yesterday. Heads-up: Vince Cable, business secretary, is being grilled over the Royal Mail flotation this morning. Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging all the action from Westminster: Vince Cable questioned by MPs about Royal Mail privatisation: Politics live blog Just 15 minutes until the Office for National Statistics announces its first estimate of UK growth for the last three months. As covered in the opening post, the consensus is that GDP increased by 0.9% during the quarter. Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, is cautious though - she reckons growth slowed to just +0.6%. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has declared that Britain's recovery is starting to \"broaden out\", but he's not ready to raise interest rates yet. On a visit to Bristol, reported this morning, Carney said the Bank is \"prudently optimistic\", but still sees plenty of 'slack' in the labour market: After meeting business leaders from the South West of England, Carney said: \u201cThere is every sign that the recovery is starting to broaden out and I would describe our attitude at the moment as prudently optimistic.\u201d \u201cWhat is important is that we see longer-term growth, and the view that we are getting from businesses here in Bristol is that the signs coming from the economy are consistent with improved longer-term growth.\u201d Carney also wants to see wage growth outpace inflation (after years of falling real wages) \u201cIn order to see a return to consistent growth we need to see improvement across all sectors and we also need to see a substantial increase in wages. \u201cWe all want the recovery to be sustainable and the early signs are consistent with that. But we need to see real growth in every sector and in the current level of wages.\u201d More on the Bristol Post. Remember George Osborne's \"March of the Makers\" -- the chancellor's rallying cry in his March 2011 budget that British industry would drive the recovery? It didn't get off to a good start -- indeed, it looked more like Napoleon's retreat from Moscow as factory struggled and Britain's balance of payments deficit soared in 2012. But today's GDP data could show the strongest increase in production in more than three years. Neil Prothero of EEF, the manufacturers organisation, predicts: Output in the manufacturing sector is likely to have expanded by 1.2% over the first quarter of 2014, which would equal the best performance since July-September 2010. He also produced this graph, showing how Britain has fared better than, say, France and Italy, in recent years. More here. London estate agent chain Foxtons (famous for garish Minis and pushy salespeople) has fuelled concerns that Britain's recovery is being driven by the fickle hand of the housing market. It reported a 44% surge in core earnings in the last three months this morning. Chairman Gerry Watts declared that turnover was \"well up\", with profit margins \"further enhanced\". Foxton's \"pipeline\" of buyers and sellers is also plumper than a year ago, suggesting demand will remain strong in the coming months. Great news for Foxton's, which is opening new branches in London. Not so good if you're trying to buy a house. Today's GDP data will confirm that Britain's economy has now been growing for 15 months in a row. We haven't seen a contraction in output since the last three months of 2012, when GDP shrank by 0.2%. The UK economy grew by 0.4% in January-March 2013, then picked up pace in the middle of the year - with growth of 0.8% in the second and third quarters. It then slowed slightly in Q4, with growth of 0.7%. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explained on Sunday why a strong GDP reading today should be treated with caution. GDP per capita (national output divided by the population) has shown little improvement since the depth of the crisis. The increase in economic output has been largely mirrored by the rise in population -- that's why people don't feel better off (the long run of falling real wages is the other factor, of course). And Britain still has a \"twin deficit problem\" - borrowing more than 5% of GDP this year to balance the books, and running a current account deficit of a similar size. That trade imbalance is a real worry, Larry wrote: The last time the UK had a current account deficit of more than 5% of GDP was in the late 1980s, when the Lawson boom was about to collapse. At that point, though, years of strong growth had left the public finances in the black and there was scope to let the public finances take the strain when the economy weakened. If the current surge in activity does prove to be short-lived, it will be no good looking to the Treasury for a fiscal boost. Instead, it will again be up to the Bank of England to keep the economy moving. Here's the full take: Booming Britain running smoothly? Don't believe the hype just yet Some City economists reckon the UK economy grew by as much as 1.1% in January-March, although others are more pessimistic. Economics reporter Katie Allen writes: Britain's economy clocked up its fastest growth for almost four years during the first quarter of 2014, outpacing other advanced nations, according to economists' forecasts ahead of official GDP data this morning. The first official estimate of GDP for the January to March quarter due at 9.30am is expected to show the economy grew 0.9%, according to the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. That would mark an acceleration from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2013 and would be the fastest growth since the second quarter of 2010 when GDP rose 1%. There was a range of views in the poll of City analysts, with the highest forecast at 1.1% growth and the lowest 0.5%. Here's Katie's full preview: UK economic growth expected to have picked up in Q1 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. How strong is the UK recovery, and how sustainable it is? We get the answer to one of those questions this morning, when the Office for National Statistics publishes its preliminary estimate of UK GDP for the first quarter of 2014. Economists believe growth picked up pace, with GDP tipped to increase by 0.9% quarter-on-quarter. That would be the biggest increase in output since the second quarter of 2010, and reinforce expectations that Britain will be the fastest growing major economy this year. The ONS publishes the GDP data at 9.30am BST. There are reasons to be cautious, even if we do get a blow-out number. Britain's economy is still smaller than its peak before the financial crisis in 2008, and many economists fear that the recovery - supported by five years of record low interest rates - isn't yet on firm foundations. But the government surely hail a strong GDP reading as proof that its economic policies are working. A year ago, George Osborne was nervously waiting to see if Britain had tumbled into a triple-dip recession. That dread event was averted - indeed, the double-dip never happened either, and today's figures could show that Britain is leaving the financial crisis behind it. Recent data has shown that manufacturers are more optimistic than anytime since 1973, and businesses do appears to be - finally - investing more. As James Knightley, economist at ING bank in London, puts it: \u201cThe UK was one of the most severely impacted economies following the global financial crisis... Now, after a protracted period of weakness the economy is back on its feet and is growing robustly.\u201d But tougher times surely lie ahead - that's the nature of economic cycles. And later today the Bank of England will announce the details of the stress tests which Britain's banks must take, to see if they can cope with whatever the next crisis throws at them. Those tests will, we believe, include a big plunge in house prices. As City editor Jill Treanor reports: The Bank of England is preparing to order eight of the UK's biggest banks and building societies to ensure they are strong enough to withstand sharp drops in house prices and sudden rises in interest rates. Before the formal publication of the tests, Sky News said banks would be required to show they could survive a 35% fall in house prices and interest rates jumping to 5%, after five years at a record low of 0.5%. The conditions that banks must be able to withstand are to be outlined by the Bank of England on Tuesday.

On Wednesday night, prospective buyers will be serenaded by Elton John. While housebuyers in the rest of the country consider themselves lucky to get a cup of tea and a biscuit when viewing new properties, purchasers of the first phase of the 3,500-home development on the 42-acre site have been invited to a lavish marquee party that will climax in a show by the Rocket Man in front of 2,500 people. The developers have not said how much they are paying. The 67-year-old singer has previously been reported to charge as much as \u00a3600,000 for a private show, with proceeds going to his charitable foundation. The event is being billed by the developers as \"a party for the community that we are creating on the site\" and they say it will benefit charity. But it has raised eyebrows in property circles, with some saying the booking signifies a return to the pre-crash years when the Pussycat Dolls could be found launching an office development in Victoria, and Simon Cowell and Mikhail Gorbachev were invited to a Cristal champagne and Sevruga caviar blowout to celebrate the sale of a \u00a350m mansion on The Bishops Avenue, the \"billionaires' row\" in north London. The Battersea Power Station Development Company chief executive, Rob Tincknell, has been stung by complaints that the majority of apartments in the first phase of the development were sold to buyers in Asia. Now he says he is creating a genuine community on the site and is selling the next phases to UK buyers first. One property executive said the selection of Elton John, \"the quintessential British rocker\", was part of that strategy. \"We're hosting the first Battersea power station party next week, with the aim of bringing together people from across the community that we are creating,\" said a spokesman for the developer. \"We've invited the purchasers of homes, potential retail and office occupiers, and stakeholders from the surrounding area, and we hope the event will become an annual occasion.\" The site \u2013 complete with the grade II*-listed hulk of Gilbert Scott's brick masterpiece \u2013 was bought by Malaysian investors and they have been determined to inject glamour into an otherwise unpromising address for the capital's elite.

      "body": "<p>Barclays most senior banker in the US is to leave, triggering fears of an exodus of staff as the business prepares for another restructuring of its controversial investment banking arm.</p> <p>Skip McGee \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/18/barclays-bank-pays-top-managers-shares-bonuses\" title=\"\">who received \u00a38.8m of shares in March</a> \u2013 was the most senior banker remaining from Barclays' takeover of the Wall Street operations of Lehman Brothers when the latter collapsed in September 2008.</p> <p>McGee took the top job in the US only 12 months ago, following a reshuffle in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal that led to the departure of the bank's boss, Bob Diamond, and the eventual departure of the previous global investment banking boss, Rich Ricci. McGee is regarded as the last individual who was part of the team responsible for the growth of the US arm of the investment bank after the 2008 crisis.</p> <p>The announcement of McGee's immediate departure comes a week before the bank's embattled chief executive, Antony Jenkins, is due to unveil a fresh strategy for the investment bank in an attempt to head off criticism over low returns for shareholders and big bonuses for bankers.</p> <p>Jenkins has been forced to defend the pay packets of the investment bankers after raising the bonus pot by 10% during 2013, when profits fell by 32% and shareholders were asked to back a \u00a35.8bn cash-call.</p> <p>Appointed in the wake of Diamond's departure after the Libor scandal, Jenkins has been under pressure to rein in the investment bank but he justified the bonus increases by saying the bank<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/05/barclays-jenkins-defends-bonus-payouts\" title=\"\"> faced a \"death spiral\" if bankers carried out their threats to leave</a>.</p> <p>At the annual shareholder meeting last week, Jenkins said the bank was going to become \"simpler, much more balanced, and much more focused\" \u2013 words taken to mean the investment bank would be subjected to sweeping job cuts as part of next week's overhaul.</p> <p>Jenkins told the bank's shareholders a week ago that his review on 8 May would examine four areas: regulatory changes, organising the group to make cost savings, focusing on sustainable returns and achieving the \"right shape and size of the investment bank\". McGee said he was looking forward to his next challenge: \"After 21 years with Lehman Brothers and Barclays, I have made the difficult decision to leave. Banking is a team sport, and I am incredibly proud of the team we assembled here.\"</p> <p>One of the reasons cited by the bank for last year's bonus rises was a doubling in the rate of departures in the investment bank, particularly in the US, following an attempt to clamp down on bonuses after the Libor crisis. The two co-heads of the US treasury bond desk left and many of their colleagues had threatened to leave, too.McGee's successor was named as Joe Gold, head of client capital management, whose role will not be as senior, as he will not have a seat on Jenkins' executive management board.

      "bodyText": "Barclays most senior banker in the US is to leave, triggering fears of an exodus of staff as the business prepares for another restructuring of its controversial investment banking arm. Skip McGee \u2013 who received \u00a38.8m of shares in March \u2013 was the most senior banker remaining from Barclays' takeover of the Wall Street operations of Lehman Brothers when the latter collapsed in September 2008. McGee took the top job in the US only 12 months ago, following a reshuffle in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal that led to the departure of the bank's boss, Bob Diamond, and the eventual departure of the previous global investment banking boss, Rich Ricci. McGee is regarded as the last individual who was part of the team responsible for the growth of the US arm of the investment bank after the 2008 crisis. The announcement of McGee's immediate departure comes a week before the bank's embattled chief executive, Antony Jenkins, is due to unveil a fresh strategy for the investment bank in an attempt to head off criticism over low returns for shareholders and big bonuses for bankers. Jenkins has been forced to defend the pay packets of the investment bankers after raising the bonus pot by 10% during 2013, when profits fell by 32% and shareholders were asked to back a \u00a35.8bn cash-call. Appointed in the wake of Diamond's departure after the Libor scandal, Jenkins has been under pressure to rein in the investment bank but he justified the bonus increases by saying the bank faced a \"death spiral\" if bankers carried out their threats to leave. At the annual shareholder meeting last week, Jenkins said the bank was going to become \"simpler, much more balanced, and much more focused\" \u2013 words taken to mean the investment bank would be subjected to sweeping job cuts as part of next week's overhaul. Jenkins told the bank's shareholders a week ago that his review on 8 May would examine four areas: regulatory changes, organising the group to make cost savings, focusing on sustainable returns and achieving the \"right shape and size of the investment bank\". McGee said he was looking forward to his next challenge: \"After 21 years with Lehman Brothers and Barclays, I have made the difficult decision to leave. Banking is a team sport, and I am incredibly proud of the team we assembled here.\" One of the reasons cited by the bank for last year's bonus rises was a doubling in the rate of departures in the investment bank, particularly in the US, following an attempt to clamp down on bonuses after the Libor crisis. The two co-heads of the US treasury bond desk left and many of their colleagues had threatened to leave, too.McGee's successor was named as Joe Gold, head of client capital management, whose role will not be as senior, as he will not have a seat on Jenkins' executive management board. He starts his new role on Thursday. The bank said Gold was being appointed as it prepared to make the changes required by new US rules \u2013 known as Dodd-Frank \u2013 that in effect require banks to ringfence their investment banking activities across the Atlantic in a holding company. Jenkins said Gold had been selected because he understood \"the rapidly changing regulatory landscape\" and would help to improve returns for shareholders in the \"evolving market environment\". McGee is said to have resigned because of the complexities associated with complying with the Dodd-Frank rules, which would require a focus over the next two years on relations with regulators, compliance and legal issues. His pay deals have only been disclosed by Barclays once \u2013 in March this year \u2013 because of his promotion to the executive committee. Information about any pay in shares to the members of this committee must be disclosed. Jenkins said \"he will leave us with the good wishes of colleagues here\". Shifting bonuses February 2013 Antony Jenkins, boss of Barclays (below), unveils his new strategy for the bank: \"There will be no going back to the old ways of doing things \u2026 We never want to be in a position again of rewarding people for activity that's inconsistent with our values.\" March 2014 Jenkins defends increasing bonuses by 10% after a 32% fall in profits. \"I have made it clear to my colleagues in the investment bank that I see this as a one-year re-basing. If we continue to see a decline in profits in the investment bank, they should not expect the same treatment this year.\" Staff could start to leave: \"You get into something of a death spiral. Your brand deteriorates and you can move very quickly from being a first-tier player to one in the second or third tier if you don't protect the franchise.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is to subject Britain's biggest banks and building societies to a series of stringent tests to see if they would be strong enough to withstand the shock of a record 35% crash in house prices, a jump in interest rates and the worst protracted slump since the aftermath of the first world war. Policymakers in Threadneedle Street will stress-test the UK's eight largest financial firms with a set of hypothetical scenarios intended to demonstrate if in extreme crisis they could avoid the taxpayer bailouts needed in 2008. Even as annual growth has returned to its fastest pace in six years the Bank's exercise will assume that in the three years to 2016 house prices fall back to levels last seen in 2002, unemployment soars to 12% \u2013 not experienced since the late 1980s and 1990s, and interest rates increase eightfold from their record low of 0.5%. As a comparison, house prices fell by about 20% during the recent crisis and have never fallen by 35%. Under these scenarios, which the Bank stresses are not forecasts, the recent economic downturn is followed by another severe slump under which GDP sinks to about 3.5% below its level at the end of last year. \"A cumulative contraction in activity to that implied by the stress scenario or larger has happened only in a single episode over the past 150 years \u2013 and that was in the immediate aftermath of the first world war,\" the Bank said. Under the scenarios which banks are being asked to simulate sterling falls 30% in the first year, inflation peaks at 6.5% in early 2015 and the government's benchmark borrowing costs peak at just below 6%. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the tests were need to ensure the banks were resilient enough to withstand crises. \"Although the events depicted in this stress-test scenario are extreme, and thus highly unlikely to transpire, by bringing together the micro-prudential standards for banks with a macro-prudential assessment of the tail risks to which they must be resilient, the Bank is working to ensure that the UK financial system remains one that absorbs rather than amplifies shocks,\" Carney said. The annual contraction in GDP factored into the stress test has occurred 10 times in the past 150 years, and the unemployment rate has been at similar levels about six times. The contraction in GDP is similar to that observed in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis. The tests are being conducted in addition to those launched on Tuesday by the European Banking Authority \u2013 the pan-European banking regulator \u2013 to examine a sample of 124 major banks across the EU. The EBA is looking at a three-year period during which the sample set of banks must be strong enough to withstand a 2.1% drop in economic output. Four UK banks will be subjected to the EBA tests \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. These and another four financial firms \u2013 Standard Chartered, Co-operative Bank, the UK arm of Santander and Nationwide Building Society \u2013 will be subjected to the extra layer of test by the Bank of England. The results will be published later in the year, after those from the EBA, which are expected in October. The EBA test envisages no changes in interest rates but the UK has included this element because 70% of mortgages are at variable rate.",

    "webTitle": "Duke of Westminster heads south of the river over London housing bubble fears", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Britain's largest private landowners is betting that the London luxury property market is at its peak after warning of a housing bubble that will burst if interest rates rise as expected next year. The Duke of Westminster has sold \u00a3240m of prime properties in central London over the past 12 months, his property company revealed yesterday, after admitting concern over escalating prices. Such has been the scale of demand for \u00a330m-\u00a350m houses in the capital that members of the globetrotting wealth set including Eric Schmidt, the billionaire chair of Google, have struggled to find a suitable London home. However, the finance director of the Duke's Grosvenor Group admitted that the luxury market could be on a precipice. \"There is a risk that a bubble is developing and that when inevitable interest rate rises occur \u2026 equity flows will reverse, placing values at risk,\" said Nicholas Scarfe. He added: \"We do not know when a correction will occur, but our own analysis indicates the prospect of a correction is becoming more likely.\" Grosvenor's concerns could have repercussions for the wider UK housing market if they spread to the rest of the capital's property stock. The behaviour of the London market has drawn warnings of a \"superbubble\" after posting a 17.7% rise in average prices to \u00a3458,000 in the year to February. But top-end housing is in the vanguard. Demand from foreign investors has pushed luxury home prices in London up by 68% since 2009, compared with a rise of 49% for the London market as a whole, according to Knight Frank. Grosvenor Group, headed by Gerald Grosvenor, one of Britain's richest men, has nonetheless reduced its exposure to luxury homes \u2013 as a landlord and property developer \u2013 in postcodes such as W1, SW1 and NW1. The properties sold last year include a row of mid-19th-century terraces on Grosvenor Crescent in Belgravia, which was bought by UK property firm Wainbridge for \u00a3114m. Mark Preston, Grosvenor's chief executive, said: \"We had concern about the level of pricing at the top end, so we thought it would be prudent to go ahead and sell some developments.\" He added: \"I'm more concerned about it [top-end price growth] than I was last year.\" The company is banking on more growth in the lower rungs of the London rental market to catch middle-income professionals who cannot get on the housing ladder. Branching out from its traditional turf, it is venturing south of the river to invest in building more affordable rental homes in Bermondsey. Grosvenor's top-end central London homes typically cost \u00a31,750 per square foot to rent, which compares with \u00a3550-\u00a3600 per square foot in Bermondsey. Matthew Pointon, analyst at Capital Economics, backed Grosvenor's concerns that house price gains in the capital are not sustainable. The economics consultancy is predicting a sharp slowdown in prices in the capital as a whole, from an estimated 16% this year to 5% next year. Grosvenor's warning came as the company reported a 38% increase in pretax profits to \u00a3506.9m for 2013.",

Such has been the scale of demand for \u00a330m-\u00a350m houses in the capital that members of the globetrotting wealth set including Eric Schmidt, the billionaire chair of Google, have struggled to find a suitable London home.</p> <p>However, the finance director of the Duke's Grosvenor Group admitted that the luxury market could be on a precipice. \"There is a risk that a bubble is developing and that when inevitable interest rate rises occur \u2026 equity flows will reverse, placing values at risk,\" said Nicholas Scarfe. He added: \"We do not know when a correction will occur, but our own analysis indicates the prospect of a correction is becoming more likely.\"</p> <p>Grosvenor's concerns could have repercussions for the wider UK housing market if they spread to the rest of the capital's property stock. The behaviour of the London market has drawn warnings of a \"superbubble\" after posting a 17.7% rise in average prices to \u00a3458,000 in the year to February. But top-end housing is in the vanguard. Demand from foreign investors has pushed luxury home prices in London up by 68% since 2009, compared with a rise of 49% for the London market as a whole, according to Knight Frank.</p> <p>Grosvenor Group, headed by Gerald Grosvenor, one of Britain's richest men, has nonetheless reduced its exposure to luxury homes \u2013 as a landlord and property developer \u2013 in postcodes such as W1, SW1 and NW1. The properties sold last year include a row of mid-19th-century terraces on Grosvenor Crescent in Belgravia, which was bought by UK property firm Wainbridge for \u00a3114m.</p> <p>Mark Preston, Grosvenor's chief executive, said: \"We had concern about the level of pricing at the top end, so we thought it would be prudent to go ahead and sell some developments.\" He added: \"I'm more concerned about it [top-end price growth] than I was last year.\"</p> <p>The company is banking on more growth in the lower rungs of the London rental market to catch middle-income professionals who cannot get on the housing ladder. Branching out from its traditional turf, it is venturing south of the river to invest in building more affordable rental homes in Bermondsey.</p> <p>Grosvenor's top-end central London homes typically cost \u00a31,750 per square foot to rent, which compares with \u00a3550-\u00a3600 per square foot in Bermondsey.</p> <p>Matthew Pointon, analyst at Capital Economics, backed Grosvenor's concerns that house price gains in the capital are not sustainable. The economics consultancy is predicting a sharp slowdown in prices in the capital as a whole, from an estimated 16% this year to 5% next year.</p> <p>Grosvenor's warning came as the company reported a 38% increase in pretax profits to \u00a3506.9m for 2013.</p>",

The economy is now well set to grow by 3% in 2014 which would be the first time it has achieved this since 2007. Growth on the domestic side of the economy is expected to be better balanced in 2014, with business investment making a markedly stronger contribution overall as more confident companies respond to the sustained improvement in economic activity. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, argues that the figures will have no immediate impact on monetary policy The UK economy is enjoying its best spell of growth since 2007, with ongoing strong growth in the first quarter setting the scene for a robust year of growth in 2014. Today's data will not affect policy. After all, the Bank of England's economists had pencilled in 1% GDP growth in the first quarter, yet not one member of the monetary policy committee saw any need to tighten policy at the latest meeting.",

BP's partnership with the Russian state-controlled oil company was in the spotlight after the US government added Rosneft's chairman, Igor Sechin, to its sanctions list this week. The contribution of the Russian stake to BP's underlying profit in the first three months was $271m (\u00a3161m), compared with a period covering only 11 days last year when the stake was first acquired, and profit was $85m. The rouble has dropped against the dollar over fears about the crisis in Ukraine and the potential effects on Russia's economy, losing close to 10% since the start of the year. The US imposed further sanctions on Russians with close links to Vladimir Putin on Monday. BP's 19.75% stake in Rosneft could come in for US attention as BP's American chief executive, Bob Dudley, tries repair the damage caused by the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Dudley said last month it was \"business as usual\" for BP in Russia and that his firm wanted to keep its stake in the country's biggest oil company. A BP spokesman reiterated the company's commitment to Russia on Monday. BP's group profit fell by 24% in the first quarter but the company increased its dividend and pledged to return more cash to shareholders. So-called underlying replacement cost profit for the first three months of BP's financial year fell to $3.2bn from $4.2bn a year earlier. The figures exclude businesses sold and non-operating items. Group profit was slightly higher than analysts' consensus forecast of $3.2bn. Upstream profit fell to $4.4bn from $5.7bn a year earlier because of \"the impact of divestments\" and higher non-cash costs. Costs included the write-off of assets in Utica shale, Ohio, where BP has decided not to go ahead with development. BP increased its quarterly dividend by 8.3% to 9.75 cents a share, in line with the group's intention to distribute more of its cash to shareholders.",

    "webTitle": "UK economy grew by 0.8% in first three months of 2014", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's economy picked up pace in the first quarter of this year but not quite as fast as economists had been expecting. The Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday that GDP expanded by 0.8% in the first quarter after 0.7% growth in the final three months of last year. That was below economists' forecast of 0.9%, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll. The year-on-year growth rate was 3.1%, the fastest in six years, but again below forecasts for 3.2% growth. The economy is still smaller than it was before the recession hit in 2008 but analysts said it was now on track to make up all the lost ground by the middle of this year. \"Today's GDP numbers were a little disappointing, though we would not be surprised to see it revised higher,\" said John Bulford at the thinktank Oxford Economics. \"There is still plenty of good news to take away from today's numbers, and we are sticking to our view that the economy will expand by 3% in 2014 as a whole, with GDP overtaking its pre-crisis peak in the next quarter.\" Although there were signs the recovery was broadening, with even the battered construction sector returning to growth in the first quarter, the ONS said the UK economy still remains 0.6% below its pre-crisis peak. Without the drag from a shrinking oil and gas sector the economy was 0.3% bigger than that pre-crisis peak, statisticians added. George Osborne seized on the figures as confirmation that the recovery was well under way. \"Today's figures show that Britain is coming back \u2013 but we can't take that for granted. We have to carry on working through our long term economic plan,\" said the chancellor. \"The impact of the great recession is still being felt, but the foundations for a broad based recovery are now in place.\" The breakdown of the data showed growth in all of Britain's main sectors in the first quarter. The dominant services sector grew by 0.9% on the quarter, while the construction sector expanded by 0.3%, rebounding from a 0.2% fall in the previous three months. British manufacturing increased by 1.3%, with industrial production overall up by 0.8%. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Encouragingly, growth was broad based in the first quarter with all sectors contributing led by the dominant services sector. Although the preliminary estimate of GDP in the first quarter is based on the output side of the economy, it is worth noting that consumer spending likely grew at a decent rate.\" The first estimate of GDP from the ONS is based on less than half the data used to produce the final estimate, and gives no detail on the spending side of the economy. Commenting on the breakdown of the numbers, the chief economist at the ONS, Joe Grice, said: \"Overall, the economy is now only 0.6% below the pre-recession peak at the beginning of 2008. In fact, services are now 2% above the pre-recession peak but the production and construction sectors are still around 12% lower.\" The weaker-than-expected figures were widely taken as easing pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates as the recovery gathers steam. With inflation now at 1.6%, well below the Bank's government-set target of 2%, policymakers could leave borrowing costs at their record low of 0.5% for some time yet, many economists said. \"The UK economy is currently in a sweet spot of solid but not runaway expansion with little in the way of visible price pressures. For that reason there does not seem to be much of a case for the monetary policy committee to push official interest rates up this year, and indeed we continue to suspect that the idea of a tightening can be shelved until after the general election in May next year,\" said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec in London. But some disagreed. James Knightley, of ING bank, forecast the economy will grow by 3% this year, putting it ahead of most developed countries. \"We only really see New Zealand as the developed market economy that can probably beat that this year. Given New Zealand has already started to tighten monetary policy, this underlines our point that the risks remain skewed towards earlier Bank of England policy tightening than the second quarter of 2015 point currently pencilled in by financial markets,\" he said. Despite faster headline growth and a drop in the unemployment rate, trade unions have warned that the recovery is not being widely felt. Reacting to the GDP data, Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, warned that the economy was not yet strong enough to withstand higher interest rates. \"However welcome these figures are, the economy remains below its 2008 peak and most people have yet to see much benefit from growth. Pay and job prospects are still below pre-crash levels, and there will need to be many more years of figures like today's before ordinary families recover lost ground,\" she said. Ian McCafferty, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, warned that although the time was not yet right for a rise in interest rates, the MPC must not run the risk of waiting too long to increase the rate. If it did, raising the rate at the gradual pace desired would not be possible. \"A gradual trajectory for rates can be ensured only if the first rate rise is not held back, such that we start the normalisation process before the economy reaches effective capacity constraints, so that inflation expectations and pressures are kept well in check,\" he said. In comments made in a speech earlier this month but published on Tuesday, McCafferty said that as UK wage growth begins to pick up, the committee must keep \"a close eye\" on pay pressures. The brighter economic data is also boosting consumer confidence, with Britons at their most optimistic about job prospects for more than six years, according to a report on Wednesday. UK consumer confidence, overall, was also the highest since late 2007, said market research firm Nielsen. \"The last year has seen a gradual upswing in UK consumer confidence as people see improvements in the economy. However, they're still cautious and it's unlikely we'll see significant changes to their buying habits in the next couple of quarters. We're not out of the woods yet, but the trees are thinning,\" said Nielsen UK &amp; Ireland group managing director Chris Morley.",

That was below economists' forecast of 0.9%, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll.</p> <p>The year-on-year growth rate was 3.1%, the fastest in six years, but again below forecasts for 3.2% growth. The economy is still smaller than it was before the recession hit in 2008 but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/29/uk-gdp-growth-2014-what-the-economists-say\" title=\"\">analysts said it was now on track to make up all the lost ground</a> by the middle of this year.</p> <p>\"Today's GDP numbers were a little disappointing, though we would not be surprised to see it revised higher,\" said John Bulford at the thinktank Oxford Economics. \"There is still plenty of good news to take away from today's numbers, and we are sticking to our view that the economy will expand by 3% in 2014 as a whole, with GDP overtaking its pre-crisis peak in the next quarter.\"</p> <p>Although there were signs the recovery was broadening, with even the battered construction sector returning to growth in the first quarter, the ONS said the UK economy still remains 0.6% below its pre-crisis peak. Without the drag from a shrinking oil and gas sector the economy was 0.3% bigger than that pre-crisis peak, statisticians added.</p> <p>George Osborne seized on the figures as confirmation that the recovery was well under way.</p> <p>\"Today's figures show that Britain is coming back \u2013 but we can't take that for granted. We have to carry on working through our long term economic plan,\" said the chancellor. \"The impact of the great recession is still being felt, but the foundations for a broad based recovery are now in place.\"</p> <p>The breakdown of the data showed growth in all of Britain's main sectors in the first quarter.</p> <p>The dominant services sector grew by 0.9% on the quarter, while the construction sector expanded by 0.3%, rebounding from a 0.2% fall in the previous three months. British manufacturing increased by 1.3%, with industrial production overall up by 0.8%.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Encouragingly, growth was broad based in the first quarter with all sectors contributing led by the dominant services sector. Although the preliminary estimate of GDP in the first quarter is based on the output side of the economy, it is worth noting that consumer spending likely grew at a decent rate.\"</p> <p>The first estimate of GDP from the ONS is based on less than half the data used to produce the final estimate, and gives no detail on the spending side of the economy.</p> <p>Commenting on the breakdown of the numbers, the chief economist at the ONS, Joe Grice, said: \"Overall, the economy is now only 0.6% below the pre-recession peak at the beginning of 2008. In fact, services are now 2% above the pre-recession peak but the production and construction sectors are still around 12% lower.\"</p> <p>The weaker-than-expected figures were widely taken as easing pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates as the recovery gathers steam. With inflation now at 1.6%, well below the Bank's government-set target of 2%, policymakers could leave borrowing costs at their record low of 0.5% for some time yet, many economists said.</p> <p>\"The UK economy is currently in a sweet spot of solid but not runaway expansion with little in the way of visible price pressures. For that reason there does not seem to be much of a case for the monetary policy committee to push official interest rates up this year, and indeed we continue to suspect that the idea of a tightening can be shelved until after the general election in May next year,\" said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec in London.</p> <p>But some disagreed.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Optimism about the strength of Britain's recovery and the prospect of a \u00a360bn bid for AstraZeneca helped push the pound to a four-and-a-half-year high against the dollar yesterday. With official growth statistics due out today, experts said the rush to buy the pound reflected a bet that the figures will show Britain outpaced other advanced economies over the first three months of the year. The pound rose as high as $1.6858, the highest point since November 2009, before losing ground in afternoon trading to $1.6825, up 0.2% \u2013 but analysts said sterling could break through $1.70 this week. There have been warnings, however, that the pound's strength risks denting the pace of recovery by hurting UK exports, with sterling having gained 10% against a basket of currencies over the past year. Meanwhile equity investors are worried they will miss out as currency movements cut payouts from companies such as BP and HSBC that report in dollars. Traders said the latest push for the pound also came partly from confirmation by US pharmaceuticals company Pfizer that it had bid for its UK rival AstraZeneca and, despite being rebuffed, was still looking at pursuing what would be the biggest foreign takeover of a UK company. \"This fits into the bigger picture and underlines increasing global demand for assets in the UK and the eurozone \u2026 which is why we have seen the pound and the euro outperform expectations this year,\" said Nawaz Ali, UK market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. The pound stood at \u20ac1.21 yesterday. A recent string of upbeat reports about the UK economy has raised expectations that the official estimate of GDP in the first quarter will show growth accelerated and outstripped the performance in the US and the eurozone in annual terms. That could increase pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates sooner than it has been indicating. The consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists is for quarterly growth to rise to 0.9% from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2013. But some economists are expecting a figure as high as 1.1%. \"A better-than-expected release could see the pound break through resistance at current levels and move towards the $1.70 mark against the US dollar,\" Ali said. UK companies that report their profits in dollars will deliver smaller sterling payouts to investors this year, with the pound's rise wiping \u00a33.5bn off this year's estimated windfall, according to a report from Capita Asset Services (CAS). Two-fifths of dividends paid out to fund managers and savers are denominated in dollars, the group's UK Dividend Monitor report said, describing sterling's strength as a \"headache for income investors\". Economists have also warned of the possible threat to exporters as the price of UK goods overseas is forced up. A senior Bank of England official said last month a further rise in sterling would damage hopes of an export boost to the economy. Charlie Bean, one of the Bank's two deputy governors, said a continued rise \"would not be particularly helpful in terms of facilitating a rebalancing towards net exports\". The thinktank Capital Economics has also raised the potential threat to the recovery from a stronger pound, but predicts it will not derail the turnaround. \"This week's GDP figures look set to show that the economy has made a strong start to 2014 \u2026 However, one of the key concerns about whether the economic recovery can sustain this strong pace has been the strength of the sterling exchange rate,\" said Capital's economist Samuel Tombs in a preview note. \"But so long as the pound does not appreciate much further, the recovery should be able to withstand it. Indeed, the latest survey evidence suggests that exporters are weathering the stronger pound quite well,\" wrote Tombs, adding there were offsetting beneficial effects on households' spending power from the stronger pound.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's economy clocked up its fastest growth for almost four years during the first quarter of 2014, outpacing other advanced nations, according to economists' forecasts ahead of official GDP data this morning. The first official estimate of GDP for the January to March quarter due at 9.30am is expected to show the economy grew 0.9%, according to the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. That would mark an acceleration from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2013 and would be the fastest growth since the second quarter of 2010 when GDP rose 1%. There was a range of views in the poll of City analysts, with the highest forecast at 1.1% growth and the lowest 0.5%. \"The UK was one of the most severely impacted economies following the global financial crisis... Now, after a protracted period of weakness the economy is back on its feet and is growing robustly,\" says James Knightley, economist at ING bank in London, predicting growth of 0.8% in the first quarter. Allan Monks, economist at JPMorgan in London, expects 0.9% growth with \"broad based strength across manufacturing, services and construction\". \"This outturn is expected despite heavy rainfall in the first half of the quarter, which the monthly data suggest affected output most notably in the construction and oil and gas sectors,\" he said. A pick-up in GDP growth would be a further boost for chancellor George Osborne on top of predictions from the International Monetary Fund this month that the UK will be the best performing of the world's largest economies this year.

      "bodyText": "The average price of a three-bedroom home in London's most expensive neighbourhoods has increased by \u00a3729 a day over the past year, according to estate agent Marsh &amp; Parsons. The firm said the price rise of 19% since April 2013, to an average of \u00a31.6m was equivalent to \u00a35,120 a week \u2013 or eight times the \u00a3658-a-week median salary for Londoners. Overall, the agent said the cost of homes in upmarket London areas including Chelsea, Kensington, Notting Hill, Clapham and Fulham was up by 12.9% in the last year and by 4.3% in the last quarter, to \u00a31.5m, and if growth continued at the current rate the average would reach \u00a32m by 2016. Marsh &amp; Parsons said it had seen \"a huge surge\" in the number of UK buyers purchasing prime London property in the last three months, with this group making up 78% of the market. In areas including Kensington &amp; Chelsea, typically a stronghold for overseas buyers, the proportion of purchases by overseas and foreign nationality buyers had fallen to a two-year low of 21%. During 2012 and 2013, overseas and foreign nationality buyers accounted for around 40% of all purchases. Peter Rollings, chief executive of Marsh &amp; Parsons, said these were \"extraordinary times\" for the prime London property market. \"It's always difficult to call the 'top' of the market. But while comparisons are being drawn with 2007, the current conditions are actually remarkably different,\" he said. \"It's difficult to see how prices can fall while demand for property remains so high. Compared to the same point last year, we have seen a 20% increase in demand and a 25% fall in the supply of property. Prime London is still a strong sellers' market and jackpot prices are fast becoming the norm.\"",
