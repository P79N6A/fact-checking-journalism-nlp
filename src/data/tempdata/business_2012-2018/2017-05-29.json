      "bodyText": "In an era where fake news is like a virus, media organisations need to be very careful that they are not adding fuel to the bonfire of fantasies. Even with the best of intentions journalists should be wary of arguing that government data is dishonest \u2013 such as recent suggestions that the real unemployment rate is much higher than what the ABS would have us believe. Last week, the Australian\u2019s Adam Creighton wrote two articles suggesting the unemployment rate is a basically a crock. One of the articles was titled \u201cBe honest about unemployment \u2014 it\u2019s above 15 per cent\u201d, the other had the headline, \u201cReal jobless rate well above 20pc\u201d (pick the number you think sounds most scary, I guess). Creighton argued that because the unemployment rate only counts people who have actively looked for work in the past four weeks it excludes people who would work but were not looking. He also added into the mix everyone who is underemployed and thus arrived at a total \u201cwell above 20%\u201d. It is not. Creighton has form on unemployment trutherism. In 2014 he suggested \u201cAustralia\u2019s unemployment rate is now just shy of 51%. That is not a misprint.\u201d He came to that number by counting everyone not working \u2013 including children, stay-at-home parents and those who are retired. Little wonder last week he was writing glowingly of Donald Trump, noting that he \u201cat least has had the courage to slam the US unemployment rate\u201d. What Trump has done is suggest there are 94 million unemployed Americans rather than 7.9 million. He arrived at this figure by including everyone over 16 without a job \u2013 including students, retirees, stay-at-home parents (you see the pattern here). Trump has also suggested the unemployment rate \u201cis phoney\u201d and that \u201cthe number is probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42%\u201d. This is the problem with Creighton\u2019s article \u2013 not that he is wrong to suggest that the unemployment rate may not tell the whole story (it doesn\u2019t), but once you start suggesting the number is dishonest, then you are very quickly down the rabbit hole of making up your own facts. And unfortunately many people will read such articles and be suckered into going down that rabbit role \u2013 and before you know it politicians are dismissing official data because it doesn\u2019t suit their agenda. Heck, in Senate estimates on Monday, One Nation\u2019s Malcolm Roberts referred to the article in a question to the Treasury secretary. So let me say it clearly and plainly: the unemployment rate is not fake and it is not tricked up. The unemployment rate definition used in Australia and around the world is one set by the International Labour Organisation \u2013 not an organisation all that disposed to hiding levels of unemployment. Aside from being able compare across nations, the common definition also helps stop governments changing it to make things look better. Creighton argues that the people who were available to work but weren\u2019t looking account for around 22% of all people \u201cnot in the labour force\u201d. If we included them, it would increase unemployment by around 1.5 million and raise the unemployment rate from 5.8% to 15.9%. That might be nice if you want to come up with a big headline number to shock people, but would it really be \u201chonest\u201d? Let\u2019s look at the reasons why these people were not \u201cactively looking for work\u201d. In September 2013 (the last time the ABS looked at the makeup of people not in the labour force) only 13% of those who wanted to work but were not actively looking were \u201cdiscouraged job seekers\u201d. They stopped looking because they felt their age, or lack of skills/education meant there were no jobs, or that the jobs weren\u2019t in their region, or at suitable hours. They had given up, and they certainly deserve attention. The US Bureau of Labour Statistics includes such people in its \u201cU-4\u201d unemployment rate (it has six types of unemployment rate, \u201cU-3\u201d is the standard one) \u2013 and I\u2019d happily agree the ABS should be funded to measure these people every month. If we included them, the unemployment rate would be raised from 5.8% to around 7.3%. Higher, yes, but hardly headline-blaring higher. What about the rest of the people who are \u201cwilling to work\u201d but not looking? Most are not in the labour force for family reasons \u2013 either looking after children or an ill relative. The next most common reason is health \u2013 short-term illness or injury, or long-term condition or disability \u2013 and being pregnant. And the third most common category (two-thirds more than discouraged workers) are those attending an educational institution. Does it really make any sense to include such people as unemployed? Sure they might work if an attractive enough job came along, but they are happy enough if one doesn\u2019t: The other common complaint about the unemployment rate \u2013 and Creighton raises it as well \u2013 is that \u201canyone working more than one hour a week is considered employed\u201d. I get told this one almost every time I write on unemployment. For the love of God, please stop! It is not an issue. And what is more, you know it is not an issue. Ask yourself how many people you know who work only one hour a week? You might know someone, but I\u2019ll bet you know a heck of a lot more who work more hours than that. We know this is the case because the ABS counts the number of hours worked by all employed. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t count only one-hour workers, but we can use the number for those who work one to nine hours. In March, just 4.9% of all workers worked fewer than nine hours \u2013 the lowest amount on record. But the total is skewed by youth workers. If we count only workers aged 25-64, the percentage falls to a mere 2.6% \u2013 again the lowest on record: But even youth workers, although more likely to work short hours, are not doing so more now than in the past. The share of youth working fewer than nine hours has fallen since 2014 to 14.5%, and is now just above where it was in 2004: But let us assume we counted such workers as unemployed. This would raise the unemployment rate, but rather than give a more accurate view, it might actually distort the picture. Right now, the unemployment rate of 5.8% is the same as it was in April 2004, and yet an unemployment rate which counted one-to-nine hour workers as unemployed would be 10.3% \u2013 a rate actually lower than such a rate was in April 2004: So excluding short-hour workers from the \u201cemployed\u201d actually makes things look better now. As I have written previously, the issue with underemployment isn\u2019t a boom of one-hour workers, but part-time work replacing full-time work. And this is another problem with coming up with broader rates of unemployment \u2013 to stop discounting people, you end up exaggerating others \u2013 whether it be people working short hours, or students not working, or stay-at-home parents. If you want to include them as unemployed then OK, but is anyone also arguing they should be eligible for Newstart? Somehow I suspect not \u2013 especially when Creighton also complains about people on Newstart who don\u2019t actively look for work and blithely writes that \u201cabout 55% of 770,000 disability support pensioners claim psychological problems or muscle and joint pain; a portion of these might not be genuine\u201d. The big issue of the labour force at the moment is underemployment. I have written on it often \u2013 and have even argued that the unemployment rate is no longer the best indicator of economic health. But that is a long way from seeking to suggest the official figure unemployment is fake. And as anyone who has been out of work knows, there is a very great difference between having a job but wanting more hours and not having a job at all. We already measure both underemployment and underutilisation (unemployment and underemployment combined): My two favourite measures (as readers would know) are the employment to population ratio: And the per capita hours worked per week measure: But there is no one measure that tells the whole story. We should ensure our coverage reflects that. There is nothing wrong with creating new labour force measures, but we should be very wary of dismissing the official rates as dishonest. Doing so only serves to reduce people\u2019s confidence in the impartiality of the ABS. And we should discourage anything that would give succour to politicians \u2013 such as Trump \u2013 who seek to undermine institutions by suggesting any data inconvenient to their policies is fake.",

They stopped looking because they felt their age, or lack of skills/education meant there were no jobs, or that the jobs weren\u2019t in their region, or at suitable hours.</p> <p>They had given up, and they certainly deserve attention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/nov/01/unemployment-programs-might-give-the-government-a-nice-feeling-but-theyre-fatally-flawed\">Unemployment programs might give the government a nice feeling but they're fatally flawed | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US Bureau of Labour Statistics includes such people in its <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm\">\u201cU-4\u201d unemployment rate</a> (it has six types of unemployment rate, \u201cU-3\u201d is the standard one) \u2013 and I\u2019d happily agree the ABS should be funded to measure these people every month.</p> <p>If we included them, the unemployment rate would be raised from 5.8% to around 7.3%. Higher, yes, but hardly headline-blaring higher.</p> <p>What about the rest of the people who are \u201cwilling to work\u201d but not looking?</p> <p>Most are not in the labour force for family reasons \u2013 either looking after children or an ill relative. The next most common reason is health \u2013 short-term illness or injury, or long-term condition or disability \u2013 and being pregnant. And the third most common category (two-thirds more than discouraged workers) are those attending an educational institution.</p> <p>Does it really make any sense to include such people as unemployed? Sure they might work if an attractive enough job came along, but they are happy enough if one doesn\u2019t:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Main reason for those with a marginal attachment to the labour force not actively looking for work\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DiKVv/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The other common complaint about the unemployment rate \u2013 and Creighton raises it as well \u2013 is that \u201canyone working more than one hour a week is considered employed\u201d.</p> <p>I get told this one almost every time I write on unemployment.

You might know someone, but I\u2019ll bet you know a heck of a lot more who work more hours than that.</p> <p>We know this is the case because the ABS counts the number of hours worked by all employed. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t count only one-hour workers, but we can use the number for those who work one to nine hours.</p> <p>In March, just 4.9% of all workers worked fewer than nine hours \u2013 the lowest amount on record. But the total is skewed by youth workers. If we count only workers aged 25-64, the percentage falls to a mere 2.6% \u2013 again the lowest on record:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of 25-64yr old workers who work fewer than 9 hours a week\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9Z7Rf/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But even youth workers, although more likely to work short hours, are not doing so more now than in the past. The share of youth working fewer than nine hours has fallen since 2014 to 14.5%, and is now just above where it was in 2004:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of 15-24yr old workers who work fewer than 9 hours a week\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rx3Si/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But let us assume we counted such workers as unemployed. This would raise the unemployment rate, but rather than give a more accurate view, it might actually distort the picture.</p> <p>Right now, the unemployment rate of 5.8% is the same as it was in April 2004, and yet an unemployment rate which counted one-to-nine hour workers as unemployed would be 10.3% \u2013 a rate actually lower than such a rate was in April 2004:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployment rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JSmlQ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> So excluding short-hour workers from the \u201cemployed\u201d actually makes things look better now.</p> <p>As I have written previously, the issue with underemployment isn\u2019t a boom of one-hour workers, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/apr/25/full-time-becoming-a-fantasy-as-australians-work-fewer-hours-than-ever-before\">part-time work replacing full-time work</a>.</p> <p>And this is another problem with coming up with broader rates of unemployment \u2013 to stop discounting people, you end up exaggerating others \u2013 whether it be people working short hours, or students not working, or stay-at-home parents. If you want to include them as unemployed then OK, but is anyone also arguing they should be eligible for Newstart?</p> <p>Somehow I suspect not \u2013 especially when Creighton also complains about people on Newstart who don\u2019t actively look for work and blithely writes that \u201cabout 55% of 770,000 disability support pensioners claim psychological problems or muscle and joint pain; a portion of these might not be genuine\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/oct/04/job-vacancies-are-up-so-why-isnt-unemployment-down\">Job vacancies are up.

      "bodyText": "Greece on Monday issued a panic warning that its recovery would be thrown into doubt if Brussels blocked a debt deal at the next meeting of euro area finance ministers. Fearing that Germany will insist on delays to an agreement until at least after elections in September, Athens\u2019 finance minister hinted that the beleaguered nation could be plunged deeper into recession after seeing its economy contract by more than 25% since the start of its financial crisis. With \u00a37.5bn in debt repayments due in July and lenders meeting on 15 June to try and reach an agreement after failing last month, Euclid Tsakalotos made an urgent appeal for clarity on Monday. \u201cIt is incumbent on all sides to find a solution,\u201d he told foreign correspondents. \u201cThere is very little point in entering a [bailout] programme if the goal is not to leave the programme. And leaving the programme should be the responsibility not just of the debt country but the creditor country as well.\u201d Athens, Tsakalotos continued, had kept its side of the bargain, legislating highly unpopular reforms to produce savings of 2% of GDP, while the European Union and International Monetary Fund had not kept theirs. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept a deal which is not what was on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was on the table was if Greece carried outs its reform package then creditors would ensure that there would be a clear runway through clarity for debt.\u201d Instead, the IMF had refused to endorse the proposed solution \u2013 saying it fell far short of what was necessary to engender debt sustainability \u2013 with the result that Athens had been forced to reject it, Tsakalotos added. The Fund and Berlin \u2013 the biggest contributor of Greece\u2019s three rescue programs \u2013 have long been in disagreement over how to reduce Greek debt. Tsakalotos was addressing a hastily arranged press conference. Held in the dining room of the Athens\u2019 mansion that houses the prime minister\u2019s office, it appeared to highlight the mood of nervousness pervading the Greek government. With a debt mountain hovering around \u20ac314bn \u2013 or 180% of gross national product \u2013 the Syriza-dominated coalition of Alexis Tsipras has long argued that debt relief is essential to foreign investment and economic recovery. Greece\u2019s seven-year, triple bailout ordeal has not only deepened its dependency on international loans, but ultimately exacerbated the staggering debt load. Under pressure from creditors to pass extra pension cuts and tax rises to unlock further bailout loans that would avert default in July, Tsipras had used the carrot of debt forgiveness to convince sceptical MPs of the need to support further austerity policies. The measures, which foresee already dramatically reduced pensions being slashed by up to 18% and the tax threshold being further lowered, are to be applied once the country\u2019s third financial rescue programme expires in late 2018. Before a meeting of Euro area finance ministers this month, Tsipras voiced optimism he would soon be forced to wear a tie \u2013 a promise the open-necked leftist has pledged to uphold once Greece\u2019s debt problem is finally resolved. \u201cThe news is so positive we are having difficulty believing it,\u201d he said, adding that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had come in to handle the issue personally. But after more than eight hours of talks in Brussels, Greece\u2019s creditors were unable to bridge their differences on the country\u2019s ability to repay its debts in the long run. It was hoped agreement was within reach \u2013 one that would not only result in loan disbursements but open the way to a debt deal that would allow the European Central Bank to include Greece in its quantitative easing programme and so permit it to reaccess capital markets. Disagreement over growth projections and Athens\u2019 fiscal budget surplus abilities further complicated matters. Confronting the IMF face on, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, indicated there would be little room for compromise in a year of German general elections. Without IMF participation in Greece\u2019s latest \u20ac86bn bailout programme, both the German and Dutch governments have said it would be nigh on impossible to ratify further loan disbursements through their respective parliaments. But time, said Tsakalotos on Monday, was running out. \u201cOur ask is \u2026 that everyone keeps their side of the bargain. The position [of creditors] is going to be very difficult to defend. What can they say? That the Greek government did everything but we will send it to the rocks.\u201d",

Could the IFS now do us all a favour before this election gets underway and tell us once and for all what they think it would cost to \u201cfully meet our public care needs\u201d (viz, the figure which would meet all major needs, fully cover ongoing costs, and ultimately repay borrowing for associated capital expenditure) \u2013 as, for example, \u201ca percentage increase on existing direct tax rates\u201d. Would, say, another 10% in all rates (2p on the 20% rate, 4p on 40% and 4.5p on the 45% rate) meet the bill? Or would the figure be more like 20% on all rates? Or some yet higher figure? At least we would then reach square one in deciding what we should do to fully sort this out, at and beyond this election: pay the estimated direct tax increases; find other ways of raising revenue; get people to take out more private insurance; or contemplate continued strain on our ill and our frail old people till kingdom come?. I\u2019m surprised that none of the reporters at the IFS presentation actually raised this. Come to think of it, the Guardian\u2019s own economic commentators may have their own estimates.

Bernard Cummings Erith, Kent \u2022 The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 critique of the Conservative and Labour manifestos reported by Larry Elliott(Financial, 27 May) has added to my confusion over their plans for the NHS.

According to the King\u2019s Fund, current annual spending on the English NHS is \u00a3123.7bn, which means that, without any increase, and ignoring inflation, total spending over five years will be \u00a3618.5bn. Against this vast sum the extra expenditure promised by both parties is derisory and the IFS\u2019s statement that the Conservative promise represents an annual real-term increase of 1.2% per annum is impossible to understand. It is clear that the Labour promise is nearly four times greater than that of the Conservatives, but is still totally inadequate. The funding of the NHS has hardly been discussed by politicians or the media during the election campaign so far and this fills me with great concern for the future of this precious institution. PE Anderson St Albans, Hertfordshire \u2022 You report the claim by the IFS that Labour\u2019s plans \u201cwill not work\u201d and would require taxing across the population because to tax the rich and corporations would not generate sufficient revenue. What is missing from the current election debate and almost all media coverage is a statement of how much wealth there is in the UK and its intense concentration in the top 10% of society. The most modest estimate of this is that over \u00a35tn is owned by this group; by comparison the entire national debt is just \u00a31.7tn. Labour is proposing to raise \u00a348.6bn in new taxes. The IFS should concede that this is peanuts compared to actual level of wealth which exists. Professor Greg Philo Glasgow University Media Group \u2022 There is a swelling tide of recognition that business practices have to change fundamentally if \u201cfree\u201d market, shareholder-value-driven capitalism isn\u2019t to implode. Theresa May began her time in office with talk of building an inclusive economy, commissioning a review into mission-led business, and publishing two white papers on corporate governance and industrial strategy. An investor as respected as Larry Fink of Blackrock is making public statements on the urgency for change; academia and the public are all expressing increasing scepticism in the established business model. However, Felicity Lawrence demonstrates (Who\u2019ll pay for the multi-national tax grab? We all will, 26 May) that for many multinationals, and their professional advisors, either the message is not getting through, or is regarded as irrelevant. Clearly their claims are not consistent with the intent behind the relevant legislation, and no fundamental hardship was caused to them by the application of the laws as they were commonly understood to apply at the time. The ideal would be for the corporations voluntarily to state that, notwithstanding the technical merits of their case, they can see that they will do greater good to their wider stakeholder base by not depleting the public purse for the sake of a temporary boost to their bottom line. If that shift in perception is beyond those in charge, the government could seek to impose a one-off windfall tax, of an equivalent amount, on those businesses accepting the tax rebate. And if we cannot rely on business to do the right thing, or government to direct it to be done, then it falls on each of us to boycott the offending corporations to demonstrate there are consequences to such greed and venality, even when the law appears to condone it. Dave Hunter Bristol \u2022 Your article by Patrick Collinson (27 May) showing broadly similar tax rates across developed economies is somewhat misleading since it ignores the impact of the very high rates of local taxation in the UK that are used by government to mask the overall tax rates. By way of comparison, the Swedes, for example, pay no local taxes whatsoever, so the tax rates are all up front, not disingenuously disguised. Oh, and every Swedish citizen\u2019s tax return is a matter of public record as well.

Would, say, another 10% in all rates (2p on the 20% rate, 4p on 40% and 4.5p on the 45% rate) meet the bill? Or would the figure be more like 20% on all rates? Or some yet higher figure?</p> <p>At least we would then reach square one in deciding what we should do to fully sort this out, at and beyond this election: pay the estimated direct tax increases; find other ways of raising revenue; get people to take out more private insurance; or contemplate continued strain on our ill and our frail old people till kingdom come?. I\u2019m surprised that none of the reporters at the IFS presentation actually raised this. Come to think of it, the Guardian\u2019s own economic commentators may have their own estimates.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British Airways\u2019 chief executive says he will not resign despite a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d IT system failure that grounded scores of flights and led to cancellations and delays for 75,000 passengers over the bank holiday weekend. Alex Cruz said on Monday he was \u201cprofusely apologetic\u201d for the computing glitch, which caused havoc at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, stranding passengers including many families on half-term breaks. But he said the computing failure had nothing to do with the cost savings he had implemented since arriving at the airline as CEO last year and he rejected suggestions from the GMB union that outsourcing of IT roles to India had left the company vulnerable to system meltdowns. Flights largely returned to normal on Monday, as services from Gatwick and long-haul flights from Heathrow resumed a normal service. About 90% of short-haul flights were also operating from Heathrow, Cruz said. But the airline was still working through a backlog of passengers stranded by the weekend\u2019s cancellations. \u201cWe\u2019ve made some progress with passengers affected from Saturday and Sunday ... Just over two-thirds of those affected will make it to their final destination by the end of the day,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cThe rest are being given the option to rebook their flights for any time over the next six months. \u201cWe do apologise profusely for the hardship that customers of ours have had to go through. We know there have been holidays interrupted and personal events that have been interrupted and people waiting in queues for a really long time.\u201d Cruz described the impact of the disruption on honeymoons and long-planned family holidays as a tragedy and pledged that the airline would follow all applicable compensation rules. Passengers described total chaos that unfolded at Heathrow after the systems crashed. Rose Drury, a childcare assistant, said Terminal 5 was \u201clike a moshpit\u201d on Saturday as flights were cancelled en masse and passengers struggled to leave the airport. Staff resorted to standing on benches and shouting instructions at travellers. Dr Philip Abraham, a university teacher, told the Guardian Heathrow airport was \u201chonestly the angriest place I\u2019ve ever been\u201d as passengers queued for hours with next to no information from staff. Stranded passengers spent Saturday night sleeping on yoga mats on the floors of terminals after BA cancelled all flights leaving London hubs. Some travellers also slept in terminals on Sunday as dozens more services from Heathrow were cancelled. Hundreds of passengers flooded King\u2019s Cross station in London attempting to board trains north instead of flying. BA services around the world were also affected, leaving passengers stuck overseas. Baggage handling systems were also affected: some passengers who did manage to get on the small number of flights to take off from the UK reported reaching their destinations without their luggage. Others checked in before they discovered their flights were cancelled and were unable to extract their luggage from the system before returning home. \u201cWe are working to reunite all our customers with their bags,\u201d said a BA spokeswoman. BA is facing a significant compensation bill, with some estimating it could top \u00a3100m. Cruz told Sky News: \u201cWe absolutely are committed to provide and abide by the compensation rules that are currently in place.\u201d The worldwide IT meltdown was caused by a power surge at about 9.30am on Saturday that had a \u201ccatastrophic effect\u201d on the airline\u2019s communication hardware, \u201cwhich eventually affected all the messaging across our systems,\u201d Cruz said. He told the BBC this had affected \u201call the operating of our systems \u2013 baggage, operations, power processing.\u201d Backup systems that should have kicked in also failed, he said, adding that there was no evidence of a cyber-attack and \u201cthere has been no corruption or any compromise of any customer data.\u201d Cruz said BA was conducting an exhaustive investigation and would share the results. \u201cWe will make sure that nothing like this ever happens in British Airways again.\u201d He rebuffed a claim from the GMB that the situation had been worsened by the outsourcing of IT jobs to India. \u201cI can confirm that all the parties involved around this particular event have not been involved in any type of outsourcing in any foreign country. They have all been local issues around a local data centre who has been managed and fixed by local resources,\u201d he said. But Mick Rix, GMB\u2019s transportation lead, said Cruz was \u201ctalking out of his hat\u201d, adding that five members of the equipment and facilities team based in the centre near Heathrow that houses the mainframes had been made redundant. \u201cWe believe that the redundancies that have already taken place have led to a brain drain... [this] has led to issues like this taking place that cannot be resolved quickly,\u201d Rix said. Rix criticised BA\u2019s management for its slow public response to the crisis. \u201cOur members have had to bear the brunt of the passengers\u2019 wrath, because the senior executives and staff went running for cover,\u201d he said. Customer-facing staff were \u201cobviously quite distressed at the way they are being left to pick up the pieces for the untold misery that\u2019s being caused to passengers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of private investors who claim they were misled by Royal Bank of Scotland and its former chief executive Fred Goodwin into investing in the bank before it was rescued by the taxpayer are being urged to settle their legal case. An action group representing investors involved in the long-running legal battle has told its members it has decided to accept the 82p-a-share offer, which RBS presented to them just hours before the case was due to begin last Monday. The case has been adjourned until 7 June to allow the shareholders to consider the \u00a3200m settlement from RBS. If the deal is accepted, Goodwin and other former directors of the bank would no longer be required to give evidence in the high court. A letter sent to members of the RBS Shareholder Action Group on Saturday states: \u201cHaving carefully considered the merits of the current offer ... we have decided to accept the offer of 82p per share on behalf of our membership. This is a decision which is fully supported by our legal advisers. \u201cWe understand that accepting an offer of slightly below the previously advised range of damages, being 92p per share and 234p per share, may be surprising to some claimants. However, there are a number of practical and legal risks which had to be considered.\u201d The letter goes on to say that while \u201cthe merits of the case against the bank remain strong, the merits against the individual director defendants has always been more mixed\u201d. It also adds that, even if shareholders won the case, RBS would be likely to appeal against the claim as it relates to \u201ca previously untested piece of legislation\u201d, while another trial to assess the level of damages would also need to take place. The claimants allege they were misled into buying the bank\u2019s shares in a \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008 \u2013 six months before it was bailed out \u2013 and are bringing their action against the bank, Goodwin and three other former directors. It is understood the group needs the approval of 70% of the claimants to accept the deal. An action group source said institutional shareholders involved in the claim would accept, while the majority of retail investors being represented by share trading platforms had also indicated they would take 82p a share. Each of the two groups is thought to account for about 40% of the claimants. It is not known which way the remaining 20% of independent shareholders will vote, or if their views will be significant to the result. Some of those investors have previously been described as \u201cdiehards\u201d as they do not want a deal, because they want to hold former senior managers to account. The letter to claimants also confirms that Trevor Hemmings, who owns Preston North End football club and has been providing funding for the claim, has decided to accept the deal and was no longer prepared to provide funding \u2013 meaning any shareholders wanting to continue would need to find a new financial backer. The action group\u2019s letter adds: \u201cThe claim is presently being funded by a substantial claimant in the action. That claimant has decided to accept the offer and they are no longer willing to fund the action. That means that there is currently no available funding to fund the legal and other costs to take the matter to trial.\u201d While the court is not currently sitting, Mr Justice Hildyard wants an update this week and asked to be told on Thursday if a settlement has been reached before they reappear in court on 7 June. At that hearing, any shareholders wanting to continue will have to state to the court that they have the funding to carry on \u2013 a position that some involved with the case view as extremely difficult to finalise in the timeframe. The action group\u2019s letter adds: \u201cAll of the [institutional investors] have now indicated that they will accept the 82p offer ... As a result, the economic platform of costs sharing will be destabilised, meaning a smaller number of claimants sharing the costs burden, and also increasing the potential liability for adverse costs which would be divided amongst fewer continuing claimants. \u201cIn these circumstances, the viability of the case continuing to trial is now significantly in doubt.\u201d RBS has been facing a number of legal claims in relation to the April cash call. In December, the bank started to settle claims which had once amounted to \u00a34bn by announcing it had \u00a3800m to share among the various factions bringing claims. RBS has settled with 87% of them without admitting liability but to \u201cminimise material litigation expense and management distraction\u201d. The previous settlements have been about 42p a share.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The French Connection boss, Stephen Marks, has been accused of \u201cnot playing it clean\u201d in the latest round of the multimillionaire\u2019s battle with investors. After five years of losses, which have led to a near-60% slump in the value of the FTSE-listed fashion chain since 2013, Marks is under pressure to relinquish his hold on the business he founded 45 years ago. Ahead of the group\u2019s annual general meeting earlier last week, French Connection was heavily criticised by investor advisory groups including Manifest for allowing Marks to be both chairman and chief executive, for its paucity of truly independent directors and for vagueness about the targets used to decide bosses\u2019 bonuses. Meanwhile, a group of activist investors who control about 15% of the company\u2019s shares, led by Gatemore Capital Management, a London-based hedge fund that has built an 8% stake, are pressing for change. French Connection came to prominence in the 1990s with its notorious FCUK brand, which became a popular T-shirt slogan. But in recent years the firm has struggled to compete with high street rivals Next, Zara, Mango and Urban Outfitters. Liad Meidar, a managing partner at Gatemore, has accused Marks of overseeing a \u201ctremendous decline in value\u201d. The share price has dived as pre-tax losses widened to \u00a35.3m in the year to the end of January in the company\u2019s fifth loss-making year, compared with \u00a33.5m in 2016. Revenues for the once globally popular brand slipped nearly 7% to \u00a3153.2m. Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct has acquired an 11% stake in French Connection, suggesting a potential interest in a takeover. Concerns about Marks\u2019 handling of the business were heightened this week after French Connection\u2019s directors waved through a controversial board reappointment with a show of hands at the AGM. About 53% of independent shareholders who voted via proxy were against the reappointment of both Marks and the non-executive director Dean Murray. A higher proportion, nearly 56%, voted against the company\u2019s remuneration policy after shareholder groups expressed concern about unclear targets. Under listing rules, the election of independent non-executive directors at companies with a controlling shareholder who owns more than 30% of its stock must be approved by a majority of independent investors. French Connection is covered by those rules as Marks owns a near 42% stake. The company said it was not duty-bound to hold a separate vote for minority shareholders because Murray was no longer classed as an independent director under the UK corporate governance code, having spent more than nine years on its board. It said Murray had agreed to stay on as French Connection had been left with only one independent director, Claire Kent, following the resignation of former Next clothing head Christos Angelides after he joined the Reiss clothing chain. In a company statement on its website about voting at the meeting, French Connection said all the resolutions had been \u201cpassed unanimously on a show of hands\u201d at its AGM. One shareholder advisory group said the assertion about Murray\u2019s status and show of hands vote might be open to challenge by investors. Meidar suggested French Connection\u2019s board was relying on its affairs not gaining public attention and accused them of \u201cnot playing it clean\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd that the outcome relied on a count of hands at the annual meeting. It\u2019s clear that independent shareholders strongly oppose this board composition. There is no independent board. You have to ask what\u2019s the purpose of governance code and a set of recommendations that doesn\u2019t have teeth,\u201d he said. Meidar added that Marks should be running an \u201copen and transparent process to sell the company\u201d that would maximise value for all shareholders. \u201cThey need to act and to act soon.\u201d \u2022This article was amended on Tuesday 30 May. Gatemore Capital Management is an investment firm based in London, not in the US as stated earlier.",

      "bodyText": "A judge will learn this week if a multimillion-pound settlement has been reached that would keep the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Fred Goodwin from having to appear in court. Goodwin has been called to give evidence in the long-running legal battle brought by thousands of investors who argue they were misled into buying the bank\u2019s shares in a \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008. The bank was bailed out six months later, leaving the shareholders nursing losses. Their claim for \u00a3520m of compensation had been due to begin in the high court last Monday but was adjourned to allow the bank and shareholders to try to thrash out a settlement thought to be worth around \u00a3200m. While the court will not sit this week, Mr Justice Hildyard wants an update on Tuesday and asked to be told on Thursday if a settlement could be reached. The court is adjourned until 7 June. The judge has been told that \u201cprogress is being made on a settlement\u201d though some investors are being described as \u201cdiehards\u201d who do not want to do a deal with the bank because they want to hold former senior managers to account. The investors are bringing their claim against RBS, Goodwin and three former directors.

It has been reported that the businessman Trevor Hemmings, who owns Preston North End football club and is helping cover the shareholders\u2019 legal costs, is willing to accept the RBS settlement. Last December, RBS announced that it had \u00a3800m to share among the various factions bringing claims relating to the April 2008 cash call. The bank has settled with 87% of them without admitting liability but to \u201cminimise material litigation expense and management distraction\u201d.",

The deputy prime minister declined to say whether the government was looking at legal changes to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to enable a $900m loan for an Adani rail line. But he told ABC there was a \u201cbig, big issue there\u201d with state Labor, in response to pressure from its dominant left faction, firming in its stance of not providing active taxpayer support for Australia\u2019s largest proposed coal project. Joyce also said there would be an investigation of alleged conflicts of interest for board members of Naif and its advisory body, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (Efic), who have been linked to Adani and the coal industry. The Palaszczuk government announced on Saturday it would not act as \u201cmiddle man\u201d for the Naif loan to Adani, its cabinet ruling this was in line with an election promise not to give taxpayer support to the miner. Environmental lawyers argue this move leaves the commonwealth legally unable to lend directly to the miner. David Barnden of Environmental Justice Australia said a master facility agreement between state and federal government meant the money had to flow through the states. He cited the Queensland treasurer, Curtis Pitt, who told state parliament in November that \u201cunder the commonwealth\u2019s existing constitutional powers, it is unable to provide financial assistance directly to proponents within a restricted geographic area\u201d. But Pitt has played down the prospect it was an effective veto for a loan to Adani.

Way-McPhail is the chief executive of two companies involved in the Queensland coal industry, and Chaplain is an independent director of Downer EDI, which has a commercial relationship with Adani. Environmental Justice Australia has written to Naif and Efic asking whether Way-McPhail and Chaplain had disclosed \u201crelevant personal interests\u201d and were \u201cplanning to recuse themselves\u201d from any decision on Adani and another Galilee basin rail proposal by Aurizon.
