    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A battle between the world's two biggest live music companies for control of London's prime venues, including Hyde Park, Wembley Arena and the Olympic Stadium, has prompted an investigation by competition watchdogs concerned about music lovers potentially facing higher ticket prices and less choice of big name acts. The multibillion-pound live music market is dominated by US groups Live Nation, which in the last year handled tours by Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay and Rihanna and recently secured the rights to stage gigs at the Olympic stadium complex in east London, and rival AEG. AEG controls a glittering array of assets including London's O2 Arena, the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, and festivals including Coachella in California, owns David Beckham's former club LA Galaxy, and is an investor in the LA Lakers basketball team. The 02 Arena owner, which was put up for sale late last year by billionaire Philip Anschutz with a $10bn (\u00a36.4bn) price tag, ramped up its focus on dominating the London live music scene last summer when it snapped up the Hammersmith Apollo as part of a consortium that took it off the hands of beleaguered retailer HMV. Since then AEG has muscled in on the contract to run events in Hyde Park, replacing Live Nation which had put on gigs such as Live 8 and Hard Rock Calling in the central London venue for more than a decade. Just before Christmas AEG struck again, seeking to move in on Live Nation's six year hold on the venue management contract for Wembley Arena in north London, which has hosted performers including Madonna and Elton John. The Office of Fair Trading has noted AEG's London expansion and earlier this month launched an investigation into whether the proposed Wembley deal, which has not been signed off, might mean a \"substantial lessening of competition\" within the live music industry in the capital. The OFT will decide whether to refer the issue of AEG controlling London's two biggest arenas to the Competition Commission. In 2007 the regulator ruled that Live Nation and Gaiety Investments needed to sell off Hammersmith Apollo and The Forum before allowing them to buy into Academy Music Group, raising concerns including too much control over ticket pricing. \"IF AEG have control of the management of the two biggest venues there is of course the issue that they could look to impose ticket price increases, and exert more control over the artists and types of events,\" said one music industry source. Live Nation, which also owns Ticketmaster and festivals including Creamfields and Latitude, has been involved in an increasingly acrimonious spat with its rival in the battle for control of London's music venues. The company was quick to announce that it had pulled out of the Hyde Park tendering process in the autumn, citing logistical difficulties including having to shut Park Lane and noise control issues. Last summer the venue made international headlines for the wrong reasons when a duet between Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen had to be cut short mid-song due to the sound curfew. A spokesman for The Royal Parks Agency, which ran the bid process for Hyde Park, said it was a case of sour grapes and that \"Live Nation participated in the tender process from start to finish but was not selected as the preferred bidder\". Live Nation bounced back this month with the exclusive deal to host gigs at the Olympic Park and stadium in east London this summer, with the Wireless Festival and Hard Rock Calling defecting from Hyde Park. At least two gigs will be held in the main Olympic stadium. A source close to Live Nation, which claims to be the biggest provider of live events in the UK, said that the venue grab was not about building a monopolistic position, but delivering on booming demand for live music. \"Live Nation is in favour of anything that promotes competition, choice and access to different music genres for audiences not just in London, but across the UK,\" the insider said. \"The company is committed to meeting that demand in 2013, including in the Olympic Park.\" Paul Bedford, head of live events at Ingenious, which has developed festivals including Creamfields and Field Day which takes place in Victoria Park, London, said smaller players were vital to keeping the UK music scene vibrant. \"There is a bit of a land grab, they are the big boys butting heads for dominant position and there is competitive tension,\" Bedford said. \"It would be a crying shame for everyone if all the parks and key venues put out contracts to just one operator. Smaller, independent players are like indie record labels, fleet of foot [compared] to the major companies and essential for discovering new talent.\" How they line up AEG Owner Controlled by Philip Anschutz, for sale with $10bn price tag Selected venues London O2 Arena, Staples Centre in Los Angeles, Colosseum at Caesar's Palace, Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane Artists Bon Jovi, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, America's Got Talent tour Festivals Coachella, New Orleans Jazz Festival, RockNess in Scotland Sports LA Galaxy, LA Lakers, ESPN X Games, Barclays ATP World Tour finals, media partner with owner of Tour de France Live Nation Owner Listed company with $2bn valuation Results for 3 months to end of September Revenues: $1.96bn Adjusted operating income: $202.4m Attendance at concerts outside US: Up 29% yr-on-yr to 4.27m Biggest ticketing artists of 2012 (in order) Bruce Springsteen, Rihanna, Coldplay, Jay Z, Westlife, Metallica UK festivals Wireless, Hard Rock Calling, Creamfields, Latitude, Download",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thousands of families in the UK could be deprived of compensation for the death or harm of a relative caused by the diabetes drug Avandia, even though the British maker has agreed to pay billions of dollars to settle similar claims in the US. The licence for Avandia was revoked in Europe, in September 2010, because of evidence that it could cause heart failure and heart attacks. The drug can still be prescribed in the US, but not to patients at risk of heart problems. A scientist with the Food and Drug Administration estimated that Avandia could have been responsible for 100,000 heart attacks in the US. The manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, has admitted concealing data about the damaging side-effects of the drug, and there is evidence of the drug's harmful effects. But, despite this, GSK is not prepared to settle claims in the UK without a court fight. The history of drug litigation in the UK suggests that families might not easily get compensation. Daniel Slade, with the Express company of solicitors in Manchester, has 19 cases on his books and has begun proceedings against GSK in four of them. The pharmaceutical firm has told the solicitors that it will contest the cases. In just one of the cases it has indicated a willingness to spend \u00a3600,000 on its defence, which, the solicitor says, would be a fraction of what the claim is worth. \"It is very disappointing,\" said Slade. \"We anticipate that these claims do have a good prospect of success, but they still have to prove their case in the UK with suitable evidence. They are tasked with having to produce that evidence, including medical expert opinion. It is a burden one would have thought they might not have to go through.\" He expected that, if GSK fought in the courts rather than settled outside, as it had done in the US, it would take years for bereaved relatives, or those who have been harmed, to get any sort of payment. A spokesman for GSK said: \"We have every sympathy for people with complications associated with diabetes and those who care for them, but unfortunately we are unable to comment on individual legal cases. We continue to believe that the company acted appropriately and responsibly in its management of Avandia.\" Liz Thomas, policy manager at the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said it had \"become increasingly difficult in the UK to challenge large corporations such as pharmaceutical companies, an incredibly expensive form of litigation\". Corporations have a vast amount of money at their disposal to contest legal cases, but legal aid is about to cease for medical negligence cases. The Avandia cases in Manchester will be fought on a \"no win, no fee\" basis by Express solicitors. The cases in the US were settled by GSK extremely quickly, said Thomas. \"I would hope they would not take advantage [in Britain] of the inequality of arms.\" Avandia was first introduced in the NHS in July 2000. It was given to people with type 2 diabetes whose glucose levels were no longer being properly controlled by the standard drugs \u2013 metformin and a sulphonylurea drug. Avandia could be prescribed with those drugs or on its own. The drug, which generically is known as rosiglitazone, was designed to lessen the body's resistance to insulin. It was available as a standalone drug \u2013 Avandia \u2013 or in a combination with metformin, and known as Avandamet. When both drugs were withdrawn by the European Medicines Agency, there were about 90,000 people taking them in the UK. The first warnings of trouble with Avandia came in 2007, when a prominent US scientist, Steve Nissen, published data from a review of 42 clinical trials which had been carried out on the drug. The trials involved 28,000 patients, and showed that Avandia could cause heart attacks. Further trials, the results of which were published in 2010, found people on Avandia were 27% more likely to have a stroke, 25% more likely to have heart failure, and 14% more likely to die, than patients on an alternative diabetes drug. Potentially yet more damaging for GSK was its guilty plea to federal charges of concealing data about the drug's side effects. Most of the data on the drug comes from GSK's own trials. In November 2011 GSK agreed to pay $3bn to the US government over the Avandia issue and to end investigations into its marketing of the antidepressants Paxil (Seroxat in the UK) and Wellbutrin. \"This is a significant step toward resolving difficult, long-standing matters which do not reflect the company that we are today,\" Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, said at the time. GSK is also still defending cases in the UK from people who claim to have been badly affected by Seroxat. A group action, involving people who say they suffered severe withdrawal problems when they tried to stop the drug, has been going on for years though many claims have been settled in the US. The same is true of Vioxx, made by Merck, the painkiller that was withdrawn after it emerged eight years ago that it doubled the risk of a heart attack.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Going after a foreign bank for an obscure scandal only highlights how US regulators failed to pursue Wall Street's real offenders", 
      "body": "<p>Most ambitious financial regulators know there is one rule to establishing their names: reel in a really, really big fish on Wall Street, and make them pay, either through convictions, penalties, or sheer humiliation. </p> <p>The Royal Bank of Scotland is not this fish. Not only is RBS almost entirely unknown to the American populace, but its alleged crime \u2013 fixing inter-bank interest rates years ago \u2013 has failed to garner any outrage or surprise from consumers, no matter how appalling the offense. </p> <p>Yet RBS \u2013 and the London inter-bank lending rate (Libor) \u2013 is the hinge on which US regulators have recently staked both their reputation and enormous governmental prosecutorial resources. The <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323644904578270070760266356.html\">Wall Street Journal is reporting</a> that regulators are pressuring RBS to accept criminal charges in its fixing of Libor, the same way UBS did. </p> <p>As the Journal points out, it's not clear why \"pressure\" is necessary. Obviously, outside of Washington's bizarro world, RBS does not need to give its permission to be prosecuted for wrongdoing by the US government. </p> <p>But here's the real problem: the outmoded, cosy system of prosecution, which has regulators still bound by old handshake agreements. Banks and prosecutors work closely to agree on a deal that is severe enough to make regulators look tough, but does not hurt the bank's reputation to the point of real financial harm. The Journal has this eye-popping paragraph, for instance, about a deal with Swiss bank UBS:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Justice department officials were heartened by the lack of a negative reaction in the markets and among regulators around the world to UBS's guilty plea. Before the settlement deal, some officials had worried it could destabilize the bank.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>No wonder, then, that one idea under discussion by US regulators is to go after a completely inconsequential Asian subsidiary of RBS for allegedly rigging Libor.</p> <p>Not to nitpick, but this is missing the point of prosecution entirely. It's not just the friendliness of the arrangements, but the purpose. It doesn't become the US government to approach wrongdoers hat in hand, whispering, \"Please, sir, may we prosecute you? If you don't mind, of course \u2026 we hate to be a bother of any kind.\"</p> <p>This is obviously problematic.

      "bodyText": "Most ambitious financial regulators know there is one rule to establishing their names: reel in a really, really big fish on Wall Street, and make them pay, either through convictions, penalties, or sheer humiliation. The Royal Bank of Scotland is not this fish. Not only is RBS almost entirely unknown to the American populace, but its alleged crime \u2013 fixing inter-bank interest rates years ago \u2013 has failed to garner any outrage or surprise from consumers, no matter how appalling the offense. Yet RBS \u2013 and the London inter-bank lending rate (Libor) \u2013 is the hinge on which US regulators have recently staked both their reputation and enormous governmental prosecutorial resources. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that regulators are pressuring RBS to accept criminal charges in its fixing of Libor, the same way UBS did. As the Journal points out, it's not clear why \"pressure\" is necessary. Obviously, outside of Washington's bizarro world, RBS does not need to give its permission to be prosecuted for wrongdoing by the US government. But here's the real problem: the outmoded, cosy system of prosecution, which has regulators still bound by old handshake agreements. Banks and prosecutors work closely to agree on a deal that is severe enough to make regulators look tough, but does not hurt the bank's reputation to the point of real financial harm. The Journal has this eye-popping paragraph, for instance, about a deal with Swiss bank UBS: \"Justice department officials were heartened by the lack of a negative reaction in the markets and among regulators around the world to UBS's guilty plea. Before the settlement deal, some officials had worried it could destabilize the bank.\" No wonder, then, that one idea under discussion by US regulators is to go after a completely inconsequential Asian subsidiary of RBS for allegedly rigging Libor. Not to nitpick, but this is missing the point of prosecution entirely. It's not just the friendliness of the arrangements, but the purpose. It doesn't become the US government to approach wrongdoers hat in hand, whispering, \"Please, sir, may we prosecute you? If you don't mind, of course \u2026 we hate to be a bother of any kind.\" This is obviously problematic. Part of the point of a prosecution is to inflict some damage to finances and reputation, to show the culprit the error of his ways and to provide an example to others. But banks know they will get away with whatever they do: it costs them a paltry penalty relative to the profit they or their employees already made by their alleged malfeasance. In a worst-case scenario, it could even lead to lawsuits that tie up the banks' excellent and expensive lawyers for a while, but in which they will outspend, out-think, and eventually reach a settlement \u2013 for a small portion of the actual damages.

Peter Hutton at RBC Capital Markets said:</p> <blockquote> With the need to deconsolidate up to $4bn of debt held within its LNG business, Repsol has indicated [there will be] an announcement in January. Repsol has previously indicated that it has been in discussions with GdF Suez and various Indian oil and gas companies, but reports today in Cinque Dias now suggest that Repsol's board this Wednesday may approve a deal with Shell. <br> We find the logic of such a deal difficult from Shell's perspective. We would not expect it to show much interest in Repsol's stakes in either Atlantic LNG (Trinidad and Tobago) or Canaport (import), but there may be some synergy on Peru LNG. </blockquote> <p>Ahead of its full year results on Thursday, Shell B shares ended 35.5p higher at \u00a323.65.</p> <p>That helped lift the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> to another new (near) five year peak, up 44.78 points to 6339.19. After an uncertain start the index easily broke through the 6300 barrier and is well on track for its best January performance for some twenty years.</p> <p>Market momentum was with the optimists despite some poor US consumer confidence figures. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> [The bad US consumer confidence] news would normally be followed by a sell off in risk assets but this has not happened, as the case for prolonging monetary stimulus is further strengthened every time such an important piece of economic data disappoints and this can be further seen by the sell off in the dollar that ensued. <br> Already people are looking ahead to what to expect from Friday's non farm payroll data which has the potential to disappoint and if this is the case, and we see the equity rally strengthen further, then we can conclude that investors are expectant of more central bank stimulus going forward. </blockquote> <p>Mining shares were in demand as copper prices rose on hopes for a steadier performance from the global economy.</p> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong> added 57p to 1929.5p after it issued a better than expected update, despite a $4bn write-off on its Minas-Rio project in Brazil. <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 69.5p to 3575.5p while <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 21.5p to 766.5p, helped by Canaccord Genuity raising its price target from 785p to 810p.</p> <p>But banking shares came under pressure.</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> dropped 22p to 335.8p following reports it was close to a settlement with UK and US authorities over the alleged rigging of libor interest rates, with a figure of \u00a3500m reported. The Wall Street Journal also says the US wants criminal charges brought.</p> <p>With the scandal back in the spotlight, banks are also hit by a number of downgrades. On Monday Goldman cut its rating on RBS, and now Espirito Santo has waded in.</p> <p>The broker has cut both RBS and <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong>, down 1.2p to 51.93p, from neutral to sell and said they both might have to raise capital with dilutive rights issues to meet new capital requirements. It said:</p> <blockquote> Analysis by the Financial Services Authority found that banks may be overstating capital by up to \u00a335bn due to differing risk weightings. We estimate that Lloyds would be most impacted if regulators moved to standardise credit risk weights and with RBS the weakest capitalised UK bank, we believe that the risk of dilutive equity raisings cannot be ruled out for the two banks. </blockquote> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> was caught up in the general gloom, falling 4.95p to 300.9p despite UBS raising its target price from 315p to 325p.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>BT</strong> lost 5.9p to 246.2p after a downgrade from buy to neutral by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. It also cut its price target from 285p to 265p, citing four main reasons. BT shares have recently performed strongly; its guidance in 2011 for revenue growth of 2% in 2013 is now expected to be a fall of 4.5%; investing in new areas like sports rights could put pressure on its cash flow; and it is more difficult to cut costs. Merrill said:</p> <blockquote> Until last quarter, BT has managed to grow EBITDA for the past four years by lowering costs. However it has taken out more than 20% of its headcount over the past five years. While there remains some scope to take out more, we believe it will be increasingly hard to do so without encountering union opposition. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Morrisons</strong> fell 3.2p to 254.1p after it lost ground in the latest Kantar Worldpanel market share data, with <strong>J Sainsbury</strong>, up 4.4p at 335.1p, and <strong>Tesco</strong>, 5.3p better at 361.25p among the winners.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>G4S</strong> edged up 1p to 279.9p. after analysts came away from a meeting with the company and two representatives of the Ministry of Justice in a positive mood. Despite its chaotic performance during the London Olympics, the MoJ indicated this would have no effect on the award of future contracts, despite G4S losing out on a prisons deal at the end of last year. Panmure Gordon's Mike Allen said:</p> <blockquote> The MoJ made it clear that the Olympic contract will not play a role in future decisions, with the quality and price of bids the key driver. In fact it sounded like pricing competition was intense during the last rounds of the prison contracts, and was the key reason why G4S was not successful. </blockquote> <p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> ended 23p higher at \u00a314.42 as Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> We expect that the earnings downgrade cycle for Glaxo is approaching its conclusion heading into the 2012 results on 6 February and a potential restructuring of the struggling European business. We believe that stabilisation in the earnings outlook could mark a change in sentiment towards the shares and a greater appreciation that Glaxo is entering a stable period of consistent 3% growth with modest pipeline assumptions, driven by consumer healthcare and emerging market pharmaceuticals. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>William Hill</strong> added 7.6p to 374p as it turned in a strong performance in its final quarter of the year, boosted by its online business.</p> <p>Total revenues rose 12% and operating profit climbed 20%. Online revenues grew by 27% and retail by 6%.</p> <p>The company is also on track to boost its online presence with its recommended offer for Sportingbet's Australian and Spanish operations and a move to acquire Playtech's 29% in William Hill Online.</p> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Firestone Diamonds</strong> fell 21% to 3.25p as it confirmed the story here that local police had removed laptops from its Lesotho site, but without a search warrant. It said the directors were not aware of any wrongdoing by the company.</p>",

The Wall Street Journal also says the US wants criminal charges brought. With the scandal back in the spotlight, banks are also hit by a number of downgrades. On Monday Goldman cut its rating on RBS, and now Espirito Santo has waded in. The broker has cut both RBS and Lloyds Banking Group, down 1.2p to 51.93p, from neutral to sell and said they both might have to raise capital with dilutive rights issues to meet new capital requirements. It said: Analysis by the Financial Services Authority found that banks may be overstating capital by up to \u00a335bn due to differing risk weightings. We estimate that Lloyds would be most impacted if regulators moved to standardise credit risk weights and with RBS the weakest capitalised UK bank, we believe that the risk of dilutive equity raisings cannot be ruled out for the two banks. Barclays was caught up in the general gloom, falling 4.95p to 300.9p despite UBS raising its target price from 315p to 325p. Meanwhile BT lost 5.9p to 246.2p after a downgrade from buy to neutral by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. It also cut its price target from 285p to 265p, citing four main reasons. BT shares have recently performed strongly; its guidance in 2011 for revenue growth of 2% in 2013 is now expected to be a fall of 4.5%; investing in new areas like sports rights could put pressure on its cash flow; and it is more difficult to cut costs. Merrill said: Until last quarter, BT has managed to grow EBITDA for the past four years by lowering costs. However it has taken out more than 20% of its headcount over the past five years. While there remains some scope to take out more, we believe it will be increasingly hard to do so without encountering union opposition. Morrisons fell 3.2p to 254.1p after it lost ground in the latest Kantar Worldpanel market share data, with J Sainsbury, up 4.4p at 335.1p, and Tesco, 5.3p better at 361.25p among the winners. Elsewhere G4S edged up 1p to 279.9p. after analysts came away from a meeting with the company and two representatives of the Ministry of Justice in a positive mood. Despite its chaotic performance during the London Olympics, the MoJ indicated this would have no effect on the award of future contracts, despite G4S losing out on a prisons deal at the end of last year. Panmure Gordon's Mike Allen said: The MoJ made it clear that the Olympic contract will not play a role in future decisions, with the quality and price of bids the key driver. In fact it sounded like pricing competition was intense during the last rounds of the prison contracts, and was the key reason why G4S was not successful. GlaxoSmithKline ended 23p higher at \u00a314.42 as Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight. The bank said: We expect that the earnings downgrade cycle for Glaxo is approaching its conclusion heading into the 2012 results on 6 February and a potential restructuring of the struggling European business. We believe that stabilisation in the earnings outlook could mark a change in sentiment towards the shares and a greater appreciation that Glaxo is entering a stable period of consistent 3% growth with modest pipeline assumptions, driven by consumer healthcare and emerging market pharmaceuticals. Among the mid-caps William Hill added 7.6p to 374p as it turned in a strong performance in its final quarter of the year, boosted by its online business. Total revenues rose 12% and operating profit climbed 20%. Online revenues grew by 27% and retail by 6%. The company is also on track to boost its online presence with its recommended offer for Sportingbet's Australian and Spanish operations and a move to acquire Playtech's 29% in William Hill Online. Lower down the market Firestone Diamonds fell 21% to 3.25p as it confirmed the story here that local police had removed laptops from its Lesotho site, but without a search warrant. It said the directors were not aware of any wrongdoing by the company.",

    "webTitle": "Eurozone crisis as it happened: Spanish retail sales slump, as US consumer confidence takes a knock", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European markets have now closed and in general, it's been another positive performance, despite some downbeat news such as the slump in Spanish retail sales and poor US consumer confidence figures. The mood among investors seems buoyant at the moment, and any dips in the market just seem to bring out the buyers again. At some point, you would expect some profit taking after the recent rises, but it has not happened in a major way yet. Still, there are some key moments ahead, including US and Spanish GDP, the latest Federal Reserve minutes and Friday's non-farm payroll numbers. But that's for later in the week. For now: \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 44.78 points higher at 6339.19, a 0.71% rise \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.2% \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.13% better \u2022 But Italy's FTSE MIB dipped 0.03% \u2022 Spain's Ibex was down 0.34% \u2022 In Athens the market closed 0.84% lower \u2022 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.38% Before we go, some news just in regarding Belgium. Standard &amp; Poor's has affirmed its AA/A- long and short term credit ratings on Belgium, with a negative outlook. The agency said the ratings were supported by the country's high levels of economic prosperity, a strong record of fiscal consolidation, a high savings rate, albeit there was a high government debt ratio and a number of fiscal and structural policy challenges. S&amp;P said it could lower the rating if its economic or budgetary performance deviated significantly from its projections or the government debt ratio went above 100% of GDP. But it could move from negative to stable if the government keeps to its budgetary strategy and introduces measures to deal with the policy challenges. And with that, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Despite the surprise drop in US consumer confidence, stock markets continue to accentuate the positive. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG said: Heading into the close the FTSE has once again risen above 6300, helped by good earnings figures and improvement in US home prices. Although the week so far has been spent milling around current highs, it seems as if there is little can hold back this rally for the time being. Each drop back, however small, seems to be taken as an invite for more investors to clamber on board for the next move higher. Ford beat expectations in its results for the final quarter, with European weakness offset by strength in the US, and while Pfizer was rather cautious in its outlook it was still able to post figures towards the top end of expectations. Added to all this, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index rose 5.2%, to its highest level since 2006. Italy's economy minister, Vittorio Grilli, has testified in parliament this afternoon about the escalating scandal involving Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena. Italy's third largest bank has been in the spotlight since it emerged that losses of up to \u20ac720m had been concealed back in 2009, when the company received an aid package from the Italian government. Monti dei Paschi needed help having taken over rival Banca Antonveneta for \u20ac9bn shortly before the financial crisis erupted. Allegations that some politicians and senior bankers were complicit in a cover-up have raged in Italy in recent days, overshadowing next month's elections. Grilli used his testimony to defend the actions of the government, and the Bank of Italy - which is charged with regulating the sector. He said the Bank of Italy had detected problems in 2010, and clamped down: An intense activity of supervision allowed the identification and the prevention of anomalous behavior. An inspection in 2011, though, discovered that \"the problems that had been highlighted were not overcome.\" Grilli added. He also insisted that the Italian financial system was sound: It is vital not to suggest that there is doubt about the stability of our banking system, because it is not true. The supervision of the Bank of Italy was appropriate, sustained and attentive and it intensified over time. The governor of the Bank of Italy during this period was none other than Mario Draghi, now president of the ECB. Draghi and Grilli, it appears, met on Monday to discuss the case (details here). Here's Capital Economics on this afternoon's surprise slide in US consumer confidence (see 3.10pm): The drop in the Conference Board measure of US consumer confidence to 58.6 in January, from 66.7, appears to have been driven by the recent payroll tax increase. In contrast, equity prices have soared to multi-year highs, jobless claims have fallen to a five-year low and most of the fiscal cliff was averted. Nevertheless, the 2% payroll tax increase apparently dampened overall confidence as households saw a hit to their pay packets. The 8.1 points drop in the headline index was driven by a drop in both the current conditions index, from 64.6 to 57.3, and the expectations sub-index, from 68.1 to 59.5. The latter is now consistent with a stagnation in consumption growth in the first quarter. Looking forward, confidence and consumer spending should improve as the year goes on. Just in, confidence among America's consumers has fallen alarmingly this month, following the clashes and deadlock on Capitol Hill over the country's finances. US consumer confidence came in at 58.6 (as measured by the Conference Board), down from 66.7 in December. That's the lowest reading since November 2011. One possible cause is that workers' take-home pay fell in January because a temporary cut in social security payments has now expired (details here). Another option is that consumers were spooked by the sight of their elected representatives squabbling over the debt ceiling. The euro continues to rally in the currency markets. It just hit a new 13-month high against the US dollar of $1.3490. It's now gained more than 11% since last summer, as this graph shows. Another sign that the situation in the markets is changing (see 12.22pm for more on the Great Rotation). Currency analysts are cautious, though, about the euro's recent strengthening. at a time when the eurozone has fallen into recession. Jeremy Cook of World First commented: Stanley Fischer will step down as Bank of Israel governor at the end of June. The plan, announced by the central bank, means Fischer's term will end two years earlier than expected. The 69-year-old will outline his reasons at a press conference on Wednesday. It means there are two central bank governorships up for grabs, while Ben Bernanke's term at the Federal Reserve ends in 12 months, so get those CVs polished! Since the Celtic Tiger crashed the level of empty buildings in the Irish capital has soared. Now, a new map has been created today which locates all of the major derelict properties and businesses in Dublin - all of them monuments to the Republic's property market collapse. Vacant sites=blue flags, boarded up houses=green flag, closed commercial=red flag, closed commercial ground floor=yellow flag, closed institutional or publicly owned=purple flag, Unclassified= blue pin Derelict properties list=red pin Henry McDonald explains: Property prices in the city fell dramatically by 56 per cent since its peak during the boom year of 2006. The map also reveals the historic class divide in Dublin between the north and south sides of the river Liffey. A majority of the empty houses, apartment complexes, shops and so on are found on the poorer north side of the river. Visually, the city centre is almost obscured by the clusters of vacant property abandoned due to the recession. Over in France Peugeot's attempts to cut thousands of jobs have been blocked, temporarily at least, by a court ruling. Judges in Paris ordered that the car-maker suspends its plan to restructure its French operations, including closing a factory in the Parisian suburb of Aulnay, with the loss of 8,000 jobs. Unions argued that Peugeot had failed to consult properly with other workers who would be affected by Aulnay's closure, and the Paris Appeal Court agreed, The ruling comes as France reels from the news that its labour minister had described the country as \u201ctotally bankrupt\u201d. Michel Sapin told radio listeners yesterday that: There is a state but it is a totally bankrupt state. That is why we had to put a deficit reduction plan in place, and nothing should make us turn away from that objective. Government officials have been scrambling to unpick the damage, with finance minister Moscovici insisting that the fiscal situation was merely \"worrying\u2019\", while Sapin himself insisted he was merely describing the situation under Nicolas Sarkozy.... Meanwhile, the city of Dijon has just sold off half of its municipal wine cellar to raise fund to support its social welfare bill. As socialist mayor Fran\u00e7ois Rebsamen put it: We have overall a good budget this year, but the social action spending of the city just keeps going up. There are more and more of our co-citizens who are appealing for social aid. More on the FT This might be of interest -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch has released research predicting the areas of finance that might do well this year, after suffering during the heights of the crisis. Summarised in this handy chart, it suggests a significant shift this year (assuming the current optimism continues, and is validated by events): Another signal that the crisis is easing \u2013 Standard &amp; Poor's has raised the outlook on Austria's AA+ credit rating to stable, from negative. The move comes 12 months after S&amp;P downgraded Austria's AAA rating, and warned a further cut was possible. Martin Koehring of The Economist Intelligence Unit isn't convinced by the Greek finance minister's claim that the risk of leaving the eurozone has almost vanished (see 9.23am for details) Greece can take heart from ongoing rebalancing in its external accounts (the current account deficit has fallen dramatically since 2008, but mostly because of a collapse in imports), and a marked improvement in budget performance. But Grexit risk is not dead: political instability remains high amid ongoing risks of social unrest and an early election. And domestic opposition to the reform agenda will remain strong, especially if the economy does not turn around significantly, which we do not expect to happen before 2015. Koehring also isn't convinced by Yannis Stournaras's argument that the Athens government has turned the economy around: From its pre-crisis peak in the third quarter of 2007 to its latest trough in the third quarter of 2012, the Greek economy contracted by more than 19%. After five years of depression, we expect the economy to contract further in 2013-14. Domestic demand in particular remains extremely weak amid ongoing fiscal austerity and rising unemployment, which has suppressed household disposable incomes. Over in the UK, MPs are quizzing pensions experts about the Bank of England's quantitative-easing (QE) programme. Mark Hyde-Harrison of the National Association of Pension Funds warned parliament the decision to buy \u00a3375bn of UK government bonds with newly created electronic money had pummeled the pension industry. He said QE had pushed up the deficits across defined benefit schemes by about \u00a390bn. That is because the value of gilts has risen (as the Bank was there as a willing buyer) driving down the yield (or rate of return) for holding them. That, he explained, meant pension funds looked weaker (as measured by the current rules) as the assets they retain are less lucrative. Even pension funds that do not own gilts are affected, because gilt yields are used as the rate to discount future pension fund liabilities, which therefore rise when yields get suppressed (my colleague Jo Moulds points out) Hyde-Harrison added: The argument we have is not particularly with quantitative easing, it's more about the way that once that \u00a390bn deficit has been created, the regulations require companies to fill it. We don't believe we're flexible enough to cope with the environment we are now in. According to Hyde-Harrison, companies are having to contribute to their schemes (and not invest elsewhere) which negates the impact of QE. Dr Ros Altmann, pensions expert and director-general of the Saga Group, was also critical of the impact of QE. She said that such loose monetary policy has backfired by devaluing pensioners' income and making them less willing to spend: Altmann added: Quantitative easing and ultra-low interest rates have hampered the spending power of those in the economy who were not over-indebted and who would otherwise have spent money. Carpetright has had a fright in the eurozone, suffering a double-digit fall in the three countries where it operates over the past 13 weeks. This took the shine off the UK flooring company's 3.2% rise in domestic sales, as my colleague Nick Fletcher explains: The European business \u2013 Netherlands, Belgium and the Republic of Ireland \u2013 was rather more threadbare than the UK, down 11.5%. The weak spot was the Netherlands, with good performances elsewhere. Chief executive Darren Shapland said: \"Our focus in the Netherlands is on protecting profit in what remains a very weak consumer environment.\" The Netherlands, of course, is suffering a recession, while its government implements an unpopular austerity package. Weak carpet sales suggest consumers are hunkering down. The Dutch housing market is in retreat, with prices falling 7% in 2012 and sales down by a similar amount. In other economic news, German consumer confidence has risen for the first time in four months, indicating that the eurozone's largest economy expects a stronger year. No relief in France, however. The research firm GfK said German consumers were \"more confident again\" having watched the recent stock market rally: Currently there are few negative reports relating to the sovereign debt crisis in the press so Germans are once again focusing on the generally pleasing domestic state of affairs. GfK revised up its reading of German consumer sentiment to 5.7 on its index, from 5.6, and reported a further rise to 5.8 this month. In France consumer sentiment remained unchanged. The country's statistics body reported overall confidence at 86 in January (100 is average), the same as December 2012. Greece's finance minister has declared there's almost no chance of the country leaving the eurozone, and the recovery will begin at the end of this year. In an interview with the BBC broadcast overnight, Yannis Stournaras said the economic position was tough, with further wage and pensions cuts hitting Greeks this year. However, there was \"much more optimism\" in the markets that the worst was over. Asked if the fear of Greece leaving the euro had vanished, Stournaras said: The probability of this happening is very, very small. We have managed to turn the economy around, yes. So I'm very optimistic that we have avoided the risk of Grexit. Stournaras also predicted the Greek economy would end its long slump this year, with recovery beginning in the final quarter. I feel absolutely sure, 100%, that this is the last year of the Greek recession. As for Britain's future in the European Union, Stournaras warned: Britain belongs to Europe politically, financially..... All in all, I believe it would be a grave mistake if Britain decides to get out of Europe. He rejected the idea that Britain could reshape its relationship with the EU, warning that every other country would also want a new deal, heralding 'the end of Europe'.... Full interview here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis and other key events in the world economy. First up, the latest economic news from Spain shows that many families suffered serious belt-tightening in the Christmas season. Spanish retail sales tumbled by 10.7% year-on-year last month \u2013 worse than the 7.8% decline recorded in November, and close to the all-time record fall of 11% recorded in September. Retail sales in Spain have fallen for 30 successive months, and accelerated since PM Mariano Rajoy implemented austerity measures intended to bring its budget into line. But with Spain's recession accelerating, Brussels officials may realise a change is needed. Olli Rehn, the EU\u2019s economic and monetary affairs commissioner, hinted as much last night. He told reporters in Madrid: If there has been a serious deterioration in the economy, we can propose an extension of a country\u2019s adjustment path... That\u2019s what we did last year in the case of Spain. Spain is understood to have flunked its target of cutting its deficit to 6.3% of GDP in 2012, which makes it much harder to hit 2013's goal of 4.5%. Rehn may be making the groundwork for another relaxation. Last week's appalling jobless data \u2013 showing 60% of young Spanish people out of work \u2013 even sent alarm bells ringing at Davos last week, with Angela Merkel calling for help from businesses to reverse the trend. Rajoy, too, may recognise that fiscal consolidation alone isn't the answer. His officials have leaked news that next month's state of the nation speech will include measures to stimulate growth such as tax breaks for young entrepreneurs. As usual, we'll be tracking the latest developments in the world of economics and finances through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Mining group Bumi has set a date for its showdown with financier Nat Rothschild, who has called a shareholder vote to press for a boardroom clearout. Bumi is to hold the general meeting of shareholders on 21 February - in the suitably martial setting of the Honourable Artillery Company in London. The company has urged shareholders to vote against all the resolutions proposed by Rothschild through his vehicle NR Investments. The financier, who founded Bumi in 2010 with Indonesia's Bakrie family, wants to replace 12 of the 14 current board members with his own slate of directors, installing himself as executive director and Tory MP Jonathan Djanogly as chairman of a new corporate governance and ethics committee. The only Bumi directors he is not seeking to remove, Sir Graham Hearne and Steven Shapiro, will resign if his resolutions are passed, Bumi said. The company believes Rothschild's plan would lead to \"stalemate, continued shareholder disputes and further value destruction\". It does not think Rothschild's board can successfully separate Bumi from the Bakrie group and dispose of its 29% stake in the Indonesian coal operation Bumi Resources. In response, Rothschild questioned the credentials of new Bumi chief executive Nick von Schirnding into question. \"Nick is a good man, we hired him as a PR man,\" he told Bloomberg TV. \"He couldn't be less qualified to be CEO of a global mining company. \"All we have tried to do is give shareholders an alternative.\" He declined to predict the outcome of next month's vote. \"These are highly sophisticated investors who can look at what's on offer and make the choices,\" he said. Von Schirnding defended Bumi's strategy, telling reporters: \"The longer we prolong the in-fighting the less value will remain for other shareholders.\" Rothschild and the Bakrie family have been at loggerheads for more than a year. Their dispute deepened last September when an investigation into alleged financial dishonestly at Bumi was launched. Rothschild resigned from the company's board in October after the Bakries offered to buy back the Indonesian mines they had originally sold to Bumi when they two sides teamed up. The affair took a further twist this month when a report claimed that the Bumi chairman's laptop had been hacked, while last week an independent investigation said it could not substantiate allegations of financial impropriety at the business, although the full report was not released.",

GlaxoSmithKline has added 6p to \u00a314.25 as Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight. The bank said: We expect that the earnings downgrade cycle for Glaxo is approaching its conclusion heading into the 2012 results on 6 February and a potential restructuring of the struggling European business. We believe that stabilisation in the earnings outlook could mark a change in sentiment towards the shares and a greater appreciation that Glaxo is entering a stable period of consistent 3% growth with modest pipeline assumptions, driven by consumer healthcare and emerging market pharmaceuticals. Lower down the market Firestone Diamonds has fallen 18% to 3.375p as it confirmed the story here that local police had removed laptops from its Lesotho site, but without a search warrant. It said the directors were not aware of any wrongdoing by the company.",
