      "bodyText": "When the International Monetary Fund met for its spring meeting in Washington 10 years ago the global economy was booming. The world was experiencing the strongest period of sustained growth since the late 1960s and early 1970s and the fund thought the good times would continue. There was a bit of concern about the rip-roaring US housing market, but no suggestion that a crisis in the sub-prime mortgage market would be the catalyst for the biggest recession since the 1930s. Even when the trickle of foreclosures turned into a flood the assumption was that it was merely a localised problem that would soon be sorted out. Only when the entire global financial system froze up a year later did everything become horribly clear. The IMF meeting of the past few days was supposed to be about how the global economy has at last emerged into the light from its long dark tunnel. Christine Lagarde, the fund\u2019s managing director, radiated optimism. For a change growth forecasts were revised up. The impression was given that everything is back under control. The reality is somewhat different. There will be no return to the world as it was in the spring of 2007 for many years, if ever. It was a moment when many trends peaked. Firstly, it represented peak America. The years leading up to 2007 had been dominated by a particular view of the world. Some called it the Washington consensus. Some called it the advent of a unipolar world, in which the US emerged victorious after its cold war struggle with the Soviet Union. Francis Fukuyama called it the end of history. Whatever the nomenclature, the basic idea was the same: the US creed of free markets and free trade would lead not just to better economic performance but to the spread of the values that underpinned western capitalism. The US remains an economic and military superpower, but it was the Chinese and not the American economy that hauled the world out of recession in 2008-09. American attempts to prevent China setting up an Asian infrastructure bank failed. When Donald Trump wanted to get tough with North Korea he had to drop plans to brand China a currency manipulator. The period between 1990 and 2007 when the US was unchallenged is over. Secondly, 2007 was peak growth. It is now apparent that the period of rapid expansion in the early 2000s was only possible because the financial system was out of control and households were taking on record amounts of debt. Banks were lending money that could only be paid back if asset prices kept on rising. They had insufficient capital to cope if \u2013 as was inevitable \u2013 the loans started to go bad. The decade since has seen so-called de-leveraging, more restrained lending backed up by bigger capital buffers and tougher regulation. To the extent that growth has been picking up over the past 18 months it is because interest rates have been kept at record lows for such a long time. Borrowing has never been cheaper and lenders have started to forget just how tough life was back in 2008. Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist and head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, noted in a recent essay in the magazine Foreign Affairs that \u201cno region of the world is currently growing as fast as it was before 2008, and none should expect to. In 2007, at the peak of the pre-crisis boom, the economies of 65 countries \u2013 including a number of large ones, such as Argentina, China, India, Nigeria, Russia and Vietnam \u2013 grew at annual rates of 7% or more. Today, just six economies are growing at that rate, and most of those are in small countries such as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Laos.\u201d In other words, there should be no desire to return to the pre-2007 growth because that would suggest another colossal bust was just around the corner. It should be a cause for concern, not celebration, that China\u2019s recent growth has relied so heavily on a credit binge that has financed infrastructure that is not really needed and factories that don\u2019t make a profit. Central banks and finance ministries have used conventional and unconventional policies over the past decade which have succeeded in preventing a second Great Depression. But they have not even got close to returning to the pre-2007 growth rates. Thirdly, the sub-prime crisis marked peak globalisation. From that moment, there was never any realistic chance of concluding the multilateral trade talks begun in Doha in 2001. Moreover, while publicly opposing protectionism, rich and poor countries alike have been putting up barriers to trade. As Lagarde noted last week, there have been around 3,000 violations of trade rules since 2008. Trump is at least upfront about his \u201cAmerica first\u201d strategy. But it is not just trade. Free movement of capital was a key component of globalisation in the 1990s and early 2000s, but these peaked at the time of the recession and have fallen back sharply as a percentage of world GDP. Finally, the crisis represented peak democracy. Although there is not the remotest possibility of a return to the pre-2007 growth rates, there is an expectation that there will be and anger that the governments that were in power at the time of the crash are incapable of delivering it. The reason for the discontent, perhaps, is that for the lucky few life is as sweet now as it was then. Giving a lecture at the IMF meetings, Raghuram Rajan, until recently the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said the forces that were causing so much anger \u2013 automation and trade \u2013 had been at work for several decades but were now much more powerful because the global financial crisis had \u201cdelegitimised the system\u201d. Rajan said: \u201cThe global elite didn\u2019t foresee the crisis and they didn\u2019t prevent it, they didn\u2019t take us out of it. Who paid the price? The people on main street. The bankers were helping themselves to big bonuses within a couple of years. The global elite knew how to look after themselves.\u201d Populist leaders have tapped into this discontent and there is now a cult of the strong leader. Trump in the United States, Vladimir Putin in Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Turkey, Narendra Modi in India all fall into this category, but there are many others. Liberal democracy is firmly on the back foot. There has been an increase in the number of people who like the idea of a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections. Trump\u2019s strongman pitch is that he can make America great again. The plan involves doubling the US growth rate and returning it to its pre-2007 trend. This is not remotely feasible and eventually the American public will realise as much. At that point a fifth peak will be reached: peak anger.",

For mothers it can be even worse, whatever industry they choose and in whichever part of the country they look for work. A TUC report last year found there was an overall gender pay gap of 34% for full-time working mothers who were born in 1970 and had their children before the age of 33. The time out from work on maternity leave before they had established themselves in skilled or senior roles effectively killed their chances of advancement, or at best restricted them, the report said. A report by the Institute for Public Policy Research this month found that the cost of childcare had risen to the point where some parents in low-income families effectively \u201cpay to work\u201d. The thinktank blamed a lack of support under the current system of tax credits as much as it did spiralling nursery charges. The report said a woman with a partner and two children who works fewer than 16 hours a week and earns the government\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.50 an hour would see her childcare costs overwhelm her earnings, leading to a net loss. This situation is also common for women on higher hourly rates when they live in high-cost areas like London. The IPPR said the capital had the lowest maternal employment rate in the country and urged mayor Sadiq Khan to lobby the government for extra subsidies to plough back into childcare facilities. Metro mayors due to be elected next month in Manchester and the West Midlands will find parents in their areas facing similar difficulties. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation asked last year whether self-employment was a possible route out of low-paid work, particularly for women. It found the government needed to put in place much more support before people with lower skills \u2013 such as former BHS workers \u2013 could make the leap. It also highlighted research by the Social Market Foundation that revealed four out of five low-paid workers remained stuck in low pay even after 10 years in self-employment. But a study by NatWest suggested that while overall interest in starting a business has risen this year, having fallen to a historical low in the run-up to and aftermath of the Brexit vote, the gender gap remains firmly in place. Its research revealed that men are still significantly more likely than women to want to set up their own business. Sixteen per cent of men say that they want to start their own business compared to 12% of women, the majority of women saying they were discouraged from doing so because of a lack of inspiring role models.",

      "bodyText": "Say what you like about Barclays\u2019 American boss Jes Staley (please, knock yourself out) but don\u2019t assume he\u2019s a stereotypical Wall Streeter with an underdeveloped sense of irony. Staley has, of course, landed himself in the soup over his attempts to unmask an internal whistleblower, who was supposedly saying mean things about a close pal and colleague. That resulted in an official warning for Staley earlier this month \u2013 but a more charitable interpretation might be that the bungling spymaster act was merely a satirical homage to the old Barclaycard ads featuring Rowan Atkinson\u2019s incompetent MI7 spook, Latham. You remember the sort of thing: an earnest Latham tries to show off his espionage skills, only to accidentally shoot himself in the scrotum with a tranquilliser pen. Or the one where our hero tries to buy a carpet by haggling with a trader in local dialect: \u201cYou sound fluent, sir.\u201d \u201cWe are both fluent, Bough; sadly in different languages\u201d. So, by that reading, Staley\u2019s efforts were not the shameful trampling over whistleblower protocols they originally appeared to be. Instead, they were a cruelly misunderstood and affectionate comic tribute to a vintage period of the bank\u2019s advertising. Please remember that when he faces the City for the first time since being publicly disgraced, at Barclays\u2019s quarterly results this week. HSBC duo face final curtain Apart from those numbers from Barclays, we have a slew of other banking events this week \u2013 among them an annual general meeting at HSBC, where the bank\u2019s board is about to undergo significant change, partly because it\u2019s time, and partly due to a row with those pesky proxy groups. Firstly, this will be chairman Douglas Flint\u2019s final AGM \u2013 although that is hardly a shock as he announced his departure a year ago. Secondly, it is farewell to non-executive director Paul Walsh, who has been pressured by proxy voting groups including ISS and Glass Lewis into stepping down because of \u201cover-boarding\u201d allegations. Before you ask, that\u2019s not a euphemism for something that happens to whistleblowers at black sites in Panama. Instead it\u2019s all about Walsh enjoying too many other directorships to concentrate on HSBC. The world\u2019s local bank had argued that this point did not apply to Walsh, as he did not hold a position of enough influence at HSBC \u2013 which inevitably lead to a paraphrasing of a classic Brian Clough question: if you\u2019re not influential, what are you doing on the effin\u2019 board? Answer: he won\u2019t be. Tough medicine for AstraZeneca boss They say that there is nothing new under the sun \u2013 a point made by both Ecclesiastes and the City, and routinely reinforced by this column. So it will prove again this week when the drugs group AstraZeneca holds its annual general meeting, where tradition (and possibly the company\u2019s constitution) dictates that there will be a tasty little scrap over executive pay. You\u2019ll recall how in the so-called shareholder spring of 2012, then Astra boss David Brennan was ousted after a row over his \u00a39m package, which he\u2019d combined with a touch of underperformance \u2013 but the pay narrative has remained pretty constant since, no matter who\u2019s been the boss. This year should prove to be another re-run, with Pirc opposing both the group\u2019s remuneration report and policy \u2013 describing the latter as a method to \u201cpromote excessive payouts\u201d. Pirc continues: \u201cThe ratio of CEO to average employee pay has been estimated and is found unacceptable at 152:1. The balance of CEO realised pay with financial performance is not considered acceptable as the change in CEO total pay over five years is not commensurate with the change in TSR [total shareholder return] over the same period.\u201d A developing story, then (which we might hear again and again).",

      "bodyText": "One way to help homebuyers overcome the affordability gap is to cut the cost of borrowing. At a time when the mortgage loan-to-income ratio is back at 2007 levels, homebuyers need all the help they can get. And that is just what the Yorkshire building society has done. Admittedly the borrower must have a 35% deposit and pay a \u00a31,495 fee upfront, but still, someone with a \u00a3200,000 mortgage will repay just \u00a3744 a month on a 25-year term, compared with \u00a31,123 on the building society\u2019s standard variable rate of 4.6%. First-time buyers are snapping up these offers, probably in many cases with financial support from their parents, to gain their first foothold on the property ladder. A hole in the market has also been carved out for them: new rules imposed on buy-to-let landlords have removed many of the tax benefits they previously enjoyed, pushing them out of the market. And in the latest mortgage figures, it is clear that it is first-timers and remortgagers who are snapping up ultra-low deals while home movers and buy-to-let landlords sit on their hands. From inside 10 Downing Street, this appears to show how the government and interest-rate setters at the Bank of England can work together to produce a change for the better. The young may suffer, on average, the worst disparity between their feeble earnings and soaring house prices in history, but at least a smart piece of policymaking has transformed their prospects. Hang on, though. It is clear that \u2013 just as with the Treasury and Bank of England\u2019s Help to Buy scheme, which subsided deposits for first-time buyers \u2013 keeping the housing market afloat takes a constant layering of policies, one upon another, to keep even middle-income groups in the game while prices climb year on year. The danger is that the endgame is something similar to the 2008 crash, which followed a similar series of rule changes to make sure ever larger numbers of mortgaged buyers were sucked into the property merry-go-round. The Bank of England, which took over the regulation of banks after the crash, has said it is getting uncomfortable with the growing volume of cheap credit rolled out by the financial sector. So far it has excluded mortgages from its list of potential problem areas, preferring to focus on credit cards and car loans. Yet the Yorkshire building society example - and there are reports Santander will soon follow suit \u2013 must be a signal that trouble lies ahead. If nothing else, ultra-low mortgage rates put a squeeze on bank profits and make them more vulnerable to shocks when they come. This was the situation Northern Rock found itself in when panic started to flow across the Atlantic from the US sub-prime mortgage market. In 2006, Northern Rock\u2019s rates, and hence its margins, were so thin it became the UK\u2019s fastest-growing lender, while the more conservative Nationwide, spooked by the low margins, pulled out of the market for several months. Now the Yorkshire is calculating it can operate on a 0.64-percentage-point margin over the BoE\u2019s 0.25% base rate when most banks need a two-percentage-point margin to turn a profit. At the moment, lenders probably have enough customers paying higher interest rates to make the whole of its mortgage operation profitable. The trouble is that the direction of travel is similar to the early 00s. Soon customer deposits will be just 5%, not 35%, and the information needed from borrowers on how they intend to pay will be sketchier. The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority, which monitors how mortgages are sold, like to assure critics that they are not the \u201clight-touch\u201d regulators of old. They say they will metaphorically kick down doors and act tough when they see a problem. Nevertheless, parliament should be wary of these promises. Banks are powerful lobbying machines and are not to be trusted. Regulators have yet to prove their worth. The last thing the country needs is for complacency or short-termist policymaking to feed another lending binge. Trump\u2019s chief protectionist has a score to settle Donald Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, the billionaire dealmaker Wilbur Ross, is beginning to put the president\u2019s America First campaign mission into practice. Trump may have fronted the announcement of an investigation into whether foreign imports of steel compromise US national security, but for Ross the ruinous impact of cheap imports is a wound that he has struggled to close for almost two decades. It was in the early 2000s that the former bankruptcy specialist made his most notable coup, bringing together LTV Steel, Acme Steel and Bethlehem Steel under the name International Steel Group. Ever since he has championed the US steel industry and as commerce secretary has seized his chance to block foreign imports. He admitted that tightening anti-dumping rules earlier this year had done little to deter foreign imports, which now account for around a quarter of all steel used in the US, and so he was falling back on obscure national security legislation. It may seem like a desperate measure, but with Ross in charge, it could result in a more difficult market for Japanese and Chinese competitors. Tadaaki Yamaguchi, the chairman of the Japan Steel Information Centre, which lobbies for the Japanese steel industry in the US, spoke for all free-trade supporters when he said there were far more American jobs at stake in firms that consumed steel than there were in domestic steel production, and that those jobs would be at risk because prices would rise. He added: \u201cAnti-competitive action and protectionism is not the American way. All this is doing is rigging the system and corrupting the marketplace.\u201d But what this view underestimates is how many people have changed their outlook since the 2008 crash. They no longer consider themselves just consumers, prepared to accept whatever punishment the free market doles out to workers in the pursuit of ever-cheaper stuff. They recognise work as important and want a decent wage. The free marketeers have a point, but not many are listening at the moment. Staley should do the decent thing on bonus One thing Jes Staley, boss of Barclays, should do when the bank announces quarterly results on Friday is to make it clear that he will refuse a bonus for 2017. It might be one way to begin to repair the considerable damage the American has done to the bank\u2019s reputation through his clumsy efforts to unmask a whistleblower. Anyone who has received a formal written reprimand from their employer must surely be ready to waive any bonus that might have been due. So far, Barclays has only promised \u201ca very significant compensation adjustment\u201d, the precise value of which will be decided once the regulators have finished their investigations. Their reports are unlikely to make easy reading. Staley \u2013 who has already faced calls to resign \u2013 could at least pre-empt them by refusing any top-ups to his \u00a32.3m fixed pay.",
