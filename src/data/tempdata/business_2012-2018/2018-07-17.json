      "bodyText": "The Papa John\u2019s founder, John Schnatter, who resigned from his role as chairman last week after using the N-word, has now reportedly said it was a mistake to leave the company. In a letter to board members, Schnatter gave more details about the conference call in May that led to his stepping down \u2013 and highlighted his feelings about Kanye West, CNBC reported. Schnatter had previously apologized for his use of the racial slur but protested that it had been part of a media training exercise organized by the pizza chain\u2019s marketing agency, Laundry Service. Schnatter resigned at the behest of the Papa John\u2019s board last Wednesday, after a Forbes article revealed he used the N-word on that call. In an interview on Friday with a local Kentucky TV station, Schnatter said that Laundry Service had \u201ckind of provoked\u201d him a little bit to use that word in a confidential PR strategy session. In the letter sent to Papa John\u2019s directors on Saturday, according to CNBC, the former chairman also mentioned Kanye West, saying the media agency suggested he partner with the musician on TV ads and promotions. According to the letter, Schnatter refused to work with West because \u201che uses the N-word in his lyrics\u201d. Schnatter\u2019s use of the N-word came in a later, separate part of the call, CNBC said. In the letter, he insisted he would never use the N-word as a racial epithet. \u201cThe board asked me to step down as chairman without apparently doing any investigation. I agreed, though today I believe it was a mistake to do so,\u201d Schnatter wrote in the letter obtained by CNBC. This is not the first time Schnatter has found himself in a publicity storm of his own making. Last November, he blamed faltering sales at the pizza chain, which was an official NFL sponsor, on NFL players peacefully protesting against racial injustice in the US. This led some white supremacists to embrace the Kentucky-based chain. The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, captioned a photo of a pizza with pepperoni swastikas: \u201cPapa John: Official pizza of the alt-right?\u201d Papa John\u2019s stock has fallen more than 33% in the past 12 months as it struggles to compete with its larger rivals Pizza Hut and Domino\u2019s. However, the announcement of Schnatter\u2019s resignation gave the company share price an 11% bump and there are now rumors it could be bought by a larger restaurant conglomerate. Papa John\u2019s is currently in the process of removing Schnatter from its advertisements and marketing material.",

      "bodyText": "Gripped by the drama at Premier Foods, the Mr Kipling firm where the chief executive may be ejected from office? Many in the City are. Cherry bakewells and french fancies have been flying for weeks as the angry Hong Kong hedge fund Oasis Management has decried Gavin Darby\u2019s leadership of what it calls a debt-ridden \u201czombie company\u201d. In return, two famous retailing Lords, MacLaurin and Price, have rushed to Darby\u2019s defence and called the agitator\u2019s proposals self-defeating. The final showdown will come at Wednesday\u2019s shareholder meeting. Premier\u2019s investors will decide by democratic vote. Actually, that last part requires a heavy qualification. Shareholders holding 8% of Premier\u2019s stock have decided they can\u2019t be bothered to weigh the arguments, form an opinion and then vote. Instead, they\u2019ve loaned their shares for a fee to one party to the quarrel \u2013 Oasis. The hedge fund owns only 9.3% of Premier but will be able to vote 17% of the stock. The tactic is legal, and the mechanics are easy. A phone call to a friendly investment bank can usually flush out a few disengaged holders who would prefer to collect a fee than exercise their judgment \u2013 as long as their anonymity is guaranteed, naturally. Yet the practice feels shabby in these circumstances. Oasis justifies its action on the grounds that it\u2019s trying to level the playing field. It thinks Nissin, the Japanese instant noodle firm with a 20% stake, should be off-side because it has a trading relationship with Premier. Oasis\u2019s plea sounds like self-interested nonsense but, yes, it is allowed to try its luck. Instead, the people who should be condemned are those fund managers who have loaned their shares to the hedge fund. Premier, despite having a full cupboard of famous old brands that runs from Ambrosia to Sharwood\u2019s, is a minnow in the stock market these days. It is worth just \u00a3400m because it is so tied down with debt and pension liabilities. But the other side of Premier\u2019s chequered history is 4,000 staff and 28,000 pensioners. By those measures, Premier is an important business that deserves the full attention of fund managers who keep telling us they are responsible \u201cstewards\u201d of other people\u2019s money. Lending ownership rights for the sake of a quick buck does not match the rhetoric. Darby hasn\u2019t covered himself in glory, as Premier\u2019s sunken share price shows. He also looks grossly over-paid given financial results. But it would be a disgrace if he is thrown overboard because Oasis\u2019s borrowed shares get it over the line. Weak leaks United Utilities, as it warned of a hosepipe ban for most of its customers in north-west England, unaccountably failed to mention it leaked more water per household last year than any other water firm in England and Wales except Thames, the perennial laggard of the sector. United leaked 133 litres per household per day, versus an industry average of 121 litres, according to Water UK\u2019s statistics for 2016-17. Naturally, United\u2019s recent annual report was able to state (accurately) that regulatory leakage targets were met for the fifth year in a row, but that may simply indicate that Ofwat\u2019s ambitions weren\u2019t terribly demanding. Even the regulator seemed to admit as much last December when it set companies a \u201cchallenge\u201d to cut leaks by 15% by 2025. Yorkshire Water, which leaked only slightly less than United on a per-household basis, quickly said it would exceed the 15% target and aim to do 40%. United, however, has yet to speak. The other omission from United\u2019s hosepipe announcement was any mention of a leak in chief executive Steve Mogford\u2019s pay packet. He has earned \u00a32m-plus every year for the last five years, with his bonus never being less than 50% of maximum. Now United has become the first water company in England for six years to warn of usage restrictions. There\u2019s been a heatwave, of course, but these are the moments when \u201coperational resilience\u201d \u2013 one of Ofwat\u2019s favourite terms \u2013 is meant to come into its own. One assumes Mogford, on a basic whack of \u00a3928,000, will be volunteering for no bonus this year \u2013 or will be told to do so. One FTSE Queenie The number of women in executive directorships at FTSE 250 firms was 29 in 2014. Today, according to research by Cranfield University, it is 30. That\u2019s right: for all the campaigning efforts by some serious business figures, it is really only FTSE 100 firms that have taken any notice \u2013 and even there progress has been glacial. The Aviva chairman, Sir Adrian Montague, says the data from FTSE 250 firms shows \u201cthere has not yet been a fundamental shift in the way UK companies work.\u201d You bet.",

    "webTitle": "'Mad marketing': Coles Little Shop for children undercuts plastic bag ban, critics say", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Environmental groups and health advocates have denounced Coles\u2019s new Little Shop promotion as \u201ccommercial exploitation of kids\u201d, \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cenvironmentally damaging\u201d. From Wednesday, Coles shoppers will be offered a free toy \u2013 a miniature version of 30 well-known household products \u2013 with every $30 spent. The range includes mini Tim Tams, Vegemite, Nutella, Leggo\u2019s pasta sauce jars and Oak chocolate milk cartons. The minis are made from various materials including paper, cardboard, plastic and foam, and \u201cwhere possible\u201d from the same material as the original product, although some, including the mini bananas and bottled water, are made from hard plastics. The executive director of the Boomerang Alliance, Jeff Angel, said: \u201cThe vast majority of these so-called collectables will be thrown away, finding their way into the litter stream and certainly landfill. It\u2019s another example of mad marketing that doesn\u2019t care about wasting resources and polluting the environment. At the beginning of July, Coles stopped giving out lightweight plastic bags, announced its produce bags would be made of 30% recycled content, committed to cutting down the plastic packaging of fruit and began introducing bins for customers to recycle soft plastic. But Angel said the new promotion undercut those measures. \u201cWhile the big retailers got kudos from the majority of people for their banning of lightweight plastic bags, you have to ask what it would take for them to run a consistent line through all their activities ... they do one good thing with one hand, and then introduce another nonsensical and environmentally damaging item with another.\u201d Each mini is individually wrapped in soft plastic. In a statement, Coles said the wrappers could be recycled through the instore RedCycle bins, but offered no recycling options for the toys themselves: \u201cThe idea behind Little Shop is that customers can keep and collect them rather than throw them out.\u201d Planet Ark\u2019s communications manager, Josh Cole, said most hard plastic toys could not be conventionally recycled. \u201c[These toys] are so fad-based, they are prone to being thrown away en masse,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can almost see it come in waves \u2013 when the new set gets released, the old one gets thrown out.\u201d Laura Trotta, an environmental engineer and sustainability campaigner described the campaign as \u201cmarketing genius\u201d but an \u201cenvironmental nightmare\u201d. She said the promotion made her question how serious Coles was about reducing plastics. \u201cI think it really destroys their credibility in that sense. They are asking us to see them as responsible corporate citizens yet they just roll out heaps of cheap plastic products for free, and most of them end up in landfill.\u201d Trotta also criticised the number of processed food products in the promotion and the inclusion of the tiny plastic water bottle, given how few bottles are recycled each year. According to the latest Australian plastics recycling survey, Australians recycle only 36% of PET plastic drink bottles, and 373m water bottles end up in landfill each year. The executive manager of Obesity Policy Coalition at Cancer Council Victoria, Jane Martin, said it was concerning there were so many unhealthy foods represented in the promotion, which she labelled \u201ccommercial exploitation of children\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s problematic because brand loyalties start young, and this brand recognition and product recognition is one way that these companies create familiarity with the brand amongst children.\u201d She said the campaign deliberately undermined parents: \u201cThis is a really quite insidious way of undermining parents and reaching children quite directly because the products are already chosen, and most people would argue that children should not be exploited commercially.\u201d She said the suppliers would consider it as a Coles promotion, allowing them to skirt any commercial code of conduct such as the Australian Food &amp; Grocery Council\u2019s guidelines on advertising to children. This made self-regulation a joke, Martin said. \u201cThis is just another example of a promotion that would not be covered because it doesn\u2019t meet the criteria that they\u2019ve set up around self-regulation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has warned that Britain would face \u201cbig economic consequences\u201d and could need emergency interest rate cuts if the country crashes out the European Union without a deal. Issuing the latest warning for Theresa May amid mounting division over her Brexit plans as Britain\u2019s withdrawal ticks ever closer, the governor of the Bank of England said failure to reach any deal with Brussels would leave the country worse off. \u201cIn a no-deal scenario there would be big economic consequences,\u201d he said. The intervention comes after the prime minister narrowly avoided a Commons rebellion from Conservative remainers unhappy over concessions she had made to hardline Brexit supporters, after accepting their amendments to a customs bill late on Monday. Carney has previously said every household in the UK lost \u00a3900 on average due to the Brexit vote. Answering questions from the Treasury select committee, which had relocated to Farnborough Air Show to underline the importance of the aerospace industry to the UK economy, Carney said Britain crashing out without a deal would force the Bank to consider the future path for interest rates. He has previously said he would be prepared to cut borrowing costs to support jobs and the economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Bank\u2019s governor said: \u201cIt would be a material event for interest rates if Britain leaves the European Union next year without a deal to smooth its departure. Our job is to make sure we are as prepared as possible.\u201d While arguing that banks in the City of London are able to withstand a disorderly Brexit, he warned Britain leaving the EU without a deal would trigger the fragmentation of the European financial system, which could drive up costs for consumers. The UK might be left with \u201ca lot of idle bankers\u201d following a hard Brexit as much of the demand for their services comes from the EU, he said. His comments come after the Bank warned that contracts worth trillions of pounds between UK and EU banks may collapse following Brexit. Carney\u2019s latest intervention came after the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government tax and spending watchdog poured cold water on May\u2019s claim that some of the increase in funding for the NHS would come from a \u201cBrexit dividend\u201d. Releasing its latest fiscal sustainability report, the OBR said: \u201cOur provisional analysis suggests Brexit is more likely to weaken than strengthen the public finances overall.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A veteran banker who also DJs under the stage name D-Sol has been named as the next chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs. David Solomon, 56, will take over from the current boss, Lloyd Blankfein, on 1 October. Blankfein steered the bank into and out of the aftermath of the financial crisis \u2013 a crisis that proved almost existential for Goldman Sachs. The bank has recovered but he leaves as its trading business, once seen as the bank\u2019s core strength, is struggling. The move ends months of speculation about Blankfein\u2019s successor and a high-profile power struggle within the bank. Solomon is an investment banker \u2013 marking a sharp change in direction for a bank that has long been dominated by traders. Solomon, the current president of the bank, is also a yoga practitioner and plays electronic dance music as DJ D-Sol. Solomon recently released his first single, a remix of the Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop. His biography on Spotify, where he has 550,509 monthly listeners, reads: \u201cHis personal mantra is to never lose sight of what you are passionate about.\u201d Last March he played a gig in Miami as part of the Paul Oakenfold Generations World Tour. In a Goldman Sachs podcast last year Solomon said: \u201cIf you can\u2019t find a way to have passions and pursue passions and mix them into your professional life and personal life in some way shape or form, it\u2019s just harder to have the energy to keep on doing this.\u201d But he acknowledged his second career was unlikely to dispel the cloud that still hangs over the banking sector\u2019s public perception. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether seeing a president of Goldman Sachs spinning tunes at a club is going to change the perception of the industry. We have got a lot of work to do on that front,\u201d he said. Blankfein became chairman and chief executive of Goldman in 2006, at the height of the housing bubble. The collapse of the housing market, the toxic assets on the bank\u2019s books and the bank\u2019s role in facilitating that crisis almost proved its undoing. But Blankfein successfully fought to get the bank back on track and the announcement of his retirement came on a day when Goldman reported a $2.6bn profit for the second quarter, capping the firm\u2019s strongest first half since 2009. Solomon became frontrunner for the job after his fellow co-president Harvey Schwartz reportedly gave the bank an ultimatum he would resign unless named chief executive. The move backfired and Schwartz retired in February. Born in Hartsdale, New York, Solomon attended Hamilton College, a liberal arts college in New York, and studied political science and government. His banking career started at Irving Trust before spells at Drexel Burnham (an investment bank forced into bankruptcy amid a trading scandal in 1990) and Bear Stearns (which collapsed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis). He moved to Goldman in 1999 and spent 10 years leading Goldman\u2019s investment banking division. In July 2007, he secured the initial public offering (IPO) of LuLulemon Athletica after having his team dress in the \u201cathleisure\u201d brand\u2019s clothes rather than suits for the meeting. He wore a maroon blazer and sweatpants. Blankfein said: \u201cDavid is the right person to lead Goldman Sachs. He has demonstrated a proven ability to build and grow businesses, identified creative ways to enhance our culture and has put clients at the center of our strategy.\u201d He added: \u201cI want to express my deep appreciation for the opportunity to work with and benefit from so many talented and dedicated colleagues. My job has also allowed me to engage with many of the most impressive business leaders around the world and I thank them for allowing me to help support their goals and priorities Solomon said he was \u201chonored and humbled\u201d to take over at Goldman Sachs, adding: \u201cI am excited about the opportunities for growth and know how vital our culture of client service and teamwork is to our success.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK wages growth slips, as Bank of England governor warns on no deal Brexit - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told MPs that a no-deal Brexit would have \u201cbig\u201d economic consequences and could prompt a review of interest rates. The Bank is widely expected to raise rates early next month, although it is by no means a certainty. The latest UK data shows unemployment steady at 4.2% but wage growth slipping back to 2.5%. While it is still above the latest 2.4% inflation rate, that could change tomorrow if - as expected - the year on year June figure rises to 2.6%. Meanwhile the government\u2019s budget watchdog has said the outlook for the country\u2019s finances has become gloomier, partly because a proposed increase in NHS spending is not paid for with tax increases or cuts in spending elsewhere. On the markets, Brexit uncertainty is rattling the pound but share indices are little changed. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. US markets have slipped back at the start of the day\u2019s trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 0.14%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.32% lower and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7%, as the disappointing Netflix update weighed on the market and sent the streaming service\u2019s shares down around 14%. Here\u2019s Investec\u2019s chief economist on the pound: The latest Brexit uncertainties have sent the pound to its lowest levels of the day. Against the dollar it is down around 0.7% at $1.3146 while against the euro it has fallen 0.43% to \u20ac1.1245. Over in New York, Goldman Sachs has confirmed that Lloyd Blankfein will step down as chairman and chief executive, the positions he has held since 2006. He will be replaced in both roles by co-chief operating officer David Solomon, who has a sideline as DJ D-Sol, spinning dance music at nightclubs. Meanwhile Goldman reported a better than expected 44% in second quarter net income, boosted by good performances in investment banking and bond trading. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said a no-deal Brexit would have big economic consequences and prompt a review of interest rates, as well as leaving many bankers idle, reports Reuters: \u201cOur job is to make sure we are as prepared as possible,\u201d Carney told lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing held at an air show in Farnborough, southern England. Crashing out would prompt the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee to reassess the economic outlook and interest rates. \u201cIt would be a material event. I wouldn\u2019t prejudge in which direction, though,\u201d Carney said. \u201cSpeaking very narrowly about the financial services side, in the event of a no-deal scenario... there would be big economic consequences. We might have a lot of idle bankers as there is not a lot of demand for their services,\u201d Carney said. Lenders, insurers and asset managers in Britain are playing safe and opening new EU hubs by March to maintain links with customers there irrespective of whether a transition deal of generous future trading terms are secured. But they worry that without a transition deal, existing cross-border contracts such as derivatives and insurance policies would be disrupted, leaving consumers unable to make claims or companies not covered against adverse moves in currencies or borrowing costs. Britain has said it will legislate to ensure \u201ccontinuity\u201d in contracts and that the EU must reciprocate, but the bloc says it was up to banks and not public authorities to get ready. \u201cYes, we are concerned that the EU has not yet indicated its solution. The private sector cannot solve these issues,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThis is fundamentally about taking responsibility to protect the financial system... It\u2019s cold comfort, but it will be worse in Euorpe than it is here.\u201d Britain\u2019s banks, however, hold enough capital and cash reserves to withstand a disorderly Brexit, Carney said... Carney said it was too soon to judge what the government\u2019s [Brexit] proposals meant for financial services or for the BoE\u2019s ability to take all decisions necessary to keep the financial system and banks stable. \u201cIt\u2019s premature for us to make a judgement on the White Paper and the outcome of these negotiations. It\u2019s also not clear which activities are going to be in scope,\u201d Carney said. The White Paper was a \u201cfirst step\u201d in a hugely important negotiation, he added. Here\u2019s our story on the day\u2019s UK data: The rate of pay growth for British workers has fallen to the lowest level in six months, despite record numbers of people in work across the country, official figures show. Heaping renewed pressure on the Bank of England to delay raising interest rates from as early as August, the latest snapshot for the British labour market showed workers are still unable to demand higher pay despite the lowest unemployment levels since the mid-1970s. High rates of employment and low levels of unemployment usually signal rising wages. The Office for National Statistics said average weekly earnings rose by 2.5% on the year in the three months to May, slowing down from the previous three months when they grew by 2.6%. Pay growth excluding bonuses also slowed by a similar amount to 2.7%. There have been signs of recovery in the British economy that could tempt the Bank to raise interest rates from as early as next month to counter persistently high levels of inflation since the EU referendum two years ago. Having shuddered to a standstill during the freezing weather earlier this year, the economy rebounded in May thanks to warmer weather and the royal wedding. The Bank has previously said it would raise rates should the economy continue to improve. The full report is here: The pound is now virtually flat against the dollar, and the FTSE 100 has dipped just 0.15% in the wake of the latest UK data. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The UK jobs report failed to move the needle on Tuesday, with investors seemingly waiting for Wednesday\u2019s inflation reading before making a call on what the Bank of England might do in August. For the quarter to the end of May wage growth including bonuses came in at 2.5%, down on the 2.6% seen for the previous 3 months; remove bonuses and wages still saw a similar decline, from 2.8% to 2.7%. Though a smidge higher than the 2.4% inflation reading seen for the same period, real wages are hardly healthy at the moment, especially with the UK CPI set to jump back to 2.6% in June. So, not the most hawkish news, if not particularly dovish either, leaving the pound without much reason to rebound on Tuesday... With Brent Crude slipping 0.7%, and BP shedding another half a percent, there was little reason for the FTSE to move higher as the day went on, the UK index keeping the wrong side of 7600. Elsewhere the UK Office for Budget Responsibility has warned on the state of the country\u2019s finances. Reuters reports: Britain\u2019s budget watchdog on Tuesday outlined a gloomier picture for the government\u2019s finances in the long term, reflecting recent pledges to increase health spending without tax hikes or spending cuts to pay for it. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) stuck to its view that the public finances are likely to come under significant pressure from an aging population. \u201cThe long-term outlook for the public finances is less favourable than at the time of our last (fiscal sustainability report) in January 2017,\u201d the OBR said in its report. This was \u201cmore than explained\u201d by the government\u2019s health spending announcement in June. Last month Prime Minister Theresa May announced a 4 billion pound ($5.3 billion) boost for the National Health Services, to be funded in part by a \u201cBrexit dividend\u201d that the Institute for Fiscal Studies says does not exist. Finance minister Philip Hammond has indicated that taxpayers will need to foot some of the bill. The OBR also looks at falling immigration: Even if the Bank of England does raise rates in August, the Brexit uncertainty casts some doubt on further increases, reckons economist James Smith at ING Bank: For the Bank of England, rising wage growth is a key pillar of its rate hike rationale. So at face value, the latest slip in average earnings (ex bonuses) to 2.7% may appear disappointing. However, it\u2019s worth noting that, like last month\u2019s fall, this is mainly a function of base effects. Wage growth was particularly weak in early 2017, but began to recover from the second quarter \u2013 meaning the year-on-year growth rates are beginning to ease. Admittedly the recent momentum has slipped a little too. But with Bank of England Agents still pointing to skill shortages resulting in more rapid pay increases, we doubt the recent figures will lead to any kind of rethink amongst the committee on the overall trend for wages. With employment growth also reasonably solid, Tuesday\u2019s jobs report gives the Bank another green light to hike in August. We doubt the few remaining data points between now and the next meeting will do much to change this. And even though the political scene has become particularly noisy, the Parliamentary recess that\u2019s due to start in a matter of days should (in theory) create a brief period of calm, giving the Bank enough cover to hike in August. However, when it comes to Brexit, the bigger headache for the Bank of England could come beyond August. With the EU likely to remain resistant to the UK\u2019s latest proposals, the perceived risk of a \u201cno deal\u201d could feasibly increase (even if the actual probability of this happening remains low in our view). If Brexit uncertainty picks up as time starts to run out, we think the Bank could have a tricky time hiking rates later this year. After an August hike, our current expectation is that the BoE remains on hold until May 2019. On interest rates, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said at Farnborough a no-deal Brexit would be a material event for borrowing costs. Reuters reports: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday it would be a \u201cmaterial event\u201d for interest rates if Britain leaves the European Union next year without a deal to smooth its departure. \u201cOur job is to make sure we are as prepared as possible,\u201d Carney told lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing held at an air show in Farnborough, southern England. Carney said he could not predict which direction rates would move in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It was too soon to judge the government\u2019s proposals for Brexit published earlier this month, Carney said. \u201cI am stopping short of saying it\u2019s all there [in the Brexit white paper],\u201d he said. Carney also said that after Brexit, the Bank needed to retain its ability to regulate banks to maintain financial stability. With the slip in wage growth to 2.5%, any increase in inflation tomorrow could see real incomes squeezed again. Analysts are forecasting inflation could rise from 2.4% to 2.6%. Ed Monk, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International said: While today\u2019s figures may put wage growth above last month\u2019s CPI inflation reading for May, any reason for British households to cheer could be short lived as there is a possibility that we could see inflation jump back up and over take wage growth when June\u2019s CPI figure is released tomorrow. If inflation does jump back up after this weakening in pay growth, then it adds to the conundrum for the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee who are desperate to deliver a rate hike in August\u2019s MPC meeting. Higher inflation would support that position but an absence of sustained real wage growth as well as ongoing fears about the impact that Brexit will have on the UK economy means that we could see the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 make an appearance again if Mark Carney and the central bank is forced to make another U-turn come August. At the Treasury committee meeting, Bank of England governor Mark Carney says he is concerned the European Union has not yet indicated its solution to continuity in derivatives contracts after Brexit. He said that a no-deal Brexit would have big economic consequences. But he said it was possible that an increase in financial services business from emerging markets could make up for any loss of EU activity. And he believed the UK banking sector was appropriately capitalised even for a disorderly Brexit. (Courtesy Reuters) They have given up trying to stream the Treasury Select committee from Farnborough: Not everyone believes an August rate rise is a done deal, however. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: Today\u2019s numbers showed wage growth dipped slightly in the three months to May, to 2.7% excluding bonuses and 2.5% including them. Unemployment held steady at an ultra-low 4.2%, but the claimant count \u2013 the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits rose unexpectedly by almost 8,000. In a quirk of the data this number is a month more recent than the rest of the report, so could spell tougher times ahead. Both sterling and the FTSE were little changed after the data was released. All in all these numbers don\u2019t alter the economic picture of anaemic growth, a relatively tight labour market and under-control inflation. Markets are still expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August. But given the increasingly uncertain climate I think there\u2019s a real chance policymakers will sit on their hands and wait for firmer signals the economy is on the right track before risking raising borrowing costs. The jobs and wages figures will probably not deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates in August, says Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst: At least one part of the UK economy is showing strength with employment hitting fresh 47 year highs in May. Slowing wage growth is unlikely to shade expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates on August 2nd although tomorrow\u2019s inflation numbers are expected to show that the real wage gains that consumers have been receiving for a few months now may peter out soon courtesy of higher oil prices and a weaker pound. Here is a chart showing the slip in wages growth: And the increase in employment: And the unemployment rate: While the stream is down from Farnborough, over to the day\u2019s big UK data release. Wages growth slipped to its weakest level in six months, rising by 2.5% in the three months to May compared to a 2.6% increase in the previous three months. Pay excluding bonuses came in at 2.7%. These were in line with analyst forecasts, and are above the inflation rate of 2.4%. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, while 137,000 jobs were created over the three months to May. Nicky Morgan now moves on to Brexit and derivatives, but the answers are impossible to hear. And the live stream has now died...... And we\u2019re off (with a rather poor audio signal from Farnborough). Chair Nicky Morgan asks about cyber attacks on the financial system as well as internal bank problems such as TSB and VIsa experienced. However the signal keeps cutting out making the answers difficult to get... The session with the Bank will be streamed live here. The Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report for June - which is what Carney and Co will be talking about shortly - warned that the EU was not doing enough to prevent disrupution to the financial system after Brexit. It said material risks remained to trillions of pounds worth of contracts. Is the pound likely to take more notice of the economic data, or the current political uncertainty? Kit Juckes at Societe Generale says: The contrast between the economy, which fully justifies the market\u2019s belief that rates will rise in August, the politics, which is a shambles, is ever more striking. The Prime Minister has sacrificed aspect of her \u2018soft Brexit\u2019 strategy to get legislation through parliament, relying on Brexiteer Labour MPs in the process and damaging her own support in the process. Labour strategists are dreaming that she\u2019ll make the Conservatives unelectable for a decade or more. But does it matter for the pound? In the short run, the data probably matter more. In the long run, it just keeps sterling anchored near historic trade-weighted lows. Investors are clearly taking a back seat as trading begins in Europe. Markets have made an unconvincing start, with the FTSE 100 losing 0.07%, Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.05%, France\u2019s Cac down 0.1% and Spain\u2019s Ibex 0.03% lower. Despite a fairly pedestrian trading update, Royal Mail is leading the FTSE 100 risers, up 1.7%. But Paddy Power Betfair has lost 2% following a sell note from analysts at Investec. More on the forthcoming UK data. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Brexit woes continue to keep the pound range bound, with too may uncertainties still unresolved regarding Brexit; deal or no deal and even over whether Theresa May will be able to cling onto power through the week. However, the UK economic calendar provides at least some distraction from Brexit concerns, this week, although it may not all be good news. UK data out today is not expected to do much to support the downbeat pound, with the employment report forecast to paint a mixed picture of the labour market... UK unemployment is expected to remain constant at 4.2%, and 115k jobs are expected to have been created in the three months to May. Wage growth is expected to remain constant and earnings including bonuses is forecast to have slipped to 2.7% from 2.8% in April. The immediate concern for the BoE will be wage growth, particularly given that inflation also continued to decline. These figures are hardly likely to encourage the BoE to vote to tighten monetary policy when it meets in two weeks\u2019 time. With rate hike expectations siting at around 70%, this probability could find it is under pressure and pull sterling towards $1.31, should wages surprise to the downside. On the other hand, should the data reinforce the central bank\u2019s theory that the slow down in the economy was just in the first quarter and that activity is picking up again in the second quarter, the pound could look to target the 50-day moving average at $1.3320. At the moment sterling is up around 0.17% at $1.3256. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Brexit concerns continuing, the latest comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be monitored carefully this morning. Carney and a number of colleagues - Andrew Bailey, Sir Jon Cunliffe and Elisabeth Stheeman - will be giving evidence on the Bank\u2019s financial stability report to the Treasury select committee. Not in parliament as usual but at Farnborough, so at least they will be able to do a bit of plane spotting too. The subject of Brexit will inevitably come up, and Carney will no doubt end up commenting on the prospects for a UK interest rate rise in August. Shortly after Carney and Co begin, there will be more UK data which should help give a little more guidance for the Bank in the shape of unemployment and wages figures. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The Bank of England will get a final look at how well the UK economy is doing this week starting today with the latest unemployment and wages data. Since the Bank of England deferred a decision on raising rates in May the UK economy has rebounded strongly from the slowdown seen in Q1 with a strong performance seen across all the major sectors, raising expectations that the monetary policy committee may coalesce around a majority decision to raise rates in just over a couple of weeks\u2019 time. This week\u2019s data could go some further in raising these expectations or dash them completely, unless Bank of England governor Mark Carney performs another one of his reverse ferrets this morning and pours cold water on the prospect when he speaks in Farnborough today, just prior to the release of this morning\u2019s data. Despite all the recent reports of job losses in the retail sector, thus far we\u2019ve seen little evidence of an impact in the headline unemployment numbers, though that could change in the coming months. For now, unemployment is expected to remain unchanged at 4.2%, while on the wages front there has been evidence that the recent rise in the private sector wages has been slowing a touch, though with inflation slipping back to 2.4% we are now seeing wages outstrip prices. This looks set to remain the case in today\u2019s numbers with weekly average earnings for the three months to May expected to fall slightly from 2.8% to 2.7%. On the markets, Wall Street ended slightly higher but after the close Netflix shares fell 14% following badly received results. So European markets are expected to make an uncertain start. Analysts at London Capital Group expect the FTSE 100 to open 3 points higher at 7603, Germany\u2019s Dax to open 3 points lower at 12558 and France\u2019s Cac to dip 1 point to 5407.

So at face value, the latest slip in average earnings (ex bonuses) to 2.7% may appear disappointing.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s worth noting that, like last month\u2019s fall, this is mainly a function of base effects. Wage growth was particularly weak in early 2017, but began to recover from the second quarter \u2013 meaning the year-on-year growth rates are beginning to ease. Admittedly the recent momentum has slipped a little too. But with Bank of England Agents still pointing to skill shortages resulting in more rapid pay increases, we doubt the recent figures will lead to any kind of rethink amongst the committee on the overall trend for wages.</p> <p>With employment growth also reasonably solid, Tuesday\u2019s jobs report gives the Bank another green light to hike in August. We doubt the few remaining data points between now and the next meeting will do much to change this. And even though the political scene has become particularly noisy, the Parliamentary recess that\u2019s due to start in a matter of days should (in theory) create a brief period of calm, giving the Bank enough cover to hike in August.</p> <p>However, when it comes to Brexit, the bigger headache for the Bank of England could come beyond August. With the EU likely to remain resistant to the UK\u2019s latest proposals, the perceived risk of a \u201cno deal\u201d could feasibly increase (even if the actual probability of this happening remains low in our view).</p> <p>If Brexit uncertainty picks up as time starts to run out, we think the Bank could have a tricky time hiking rates later this year. After an August hike, our current expectation is that the BoE remains on hold until May 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4db328e4b04dbcfcbe2232\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-17T09:20:00.525Z\">10.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On interest rates, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said at Farnborough a no-deal Brexit would be a material event for borrowing costs.

Higher inflation would support that position but an absence of sustained real wage growth as well as ongoing fears about the impact that Brexit will have on the UK economy means that we could see the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 make an appearance again if Mark Carney and the central bank is forced to make another U-turn come August. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4dae7ce4b0f86cea74aa40\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-17T08:56:24.389Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">No deal Brexit would have big economic consequences - Carney</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the Treasury committee meeting, Bank of England governor Mark Carney says he is concerned the European Union has not yet indicated its solution to continuity in derivatives contracts after Brexit.</p> <p>He said that a no-deal Brexit would have big economic consequences.

However, the UK economic calendar provides at least some distraction from Brexit concerns, this week, although it may not all be good news.</p> <p> UK data out today is not expected to do much to support the downbeat pound, with the employment report forecast to paint a mixed picture of the labour market... UK unemployment is expected to remain constant at 4.2%, and 115k jobs are expected to have been created in the three months to May. Wage growth is expected to remain constant and earnings including bonuses is forecast to have slipped to 2.7% from 2.8% in April.</p> <p> The immediate concern for the BoE will be wage growth, particularly given that inflation also continued to decline. These figures are hardly likely to encourage the BoE to vote to tighten monetary policy when it meets in two weeks\u2019 time. With rate hike expectations siting at around 70%, this probability could find it is under pressure and pull sterling towards $1.31, should wages surprise to the downside. On the other hand, should the data reinforce the central bank\u2019s theory that the slow down in the economy was just in the first quarter and that activity is picking up again in the second quarter, the pound could look to target the 50-day moving average at $1.3320.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the moment sterling is up around 0.17% at $1.3256.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b4d8ae2e4b04dbcfcbe2171\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-17T06:57:42.330Z\">7.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: UK jobs and Carney comments in focus</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/16/theresa-may-narrowly-avoids-defeat-after-caving-in-to-rees-mogg\">Brexit concerns continuing</a>, the latest comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be monitored carefully this morning.</p> <p>Carney and a number of colleagues - Andrew Bailey, Sir Jon Cunliffe and Elisabeth Stheeman - will be giving evidence on the Bank\u2019s financial stability report to the Treasury select committee. Not in parliament as usual but at Farnborough, so at least they will be able to do a bit of plane spotting too.</p> <p>The subject of Brexit will inevitably come up, and Carney will no doubt end up commenting on the prospects for a UK interest rate rise in August. </p> <p>Shortly after Carney and Co begin, there will be more UK data which should help give a little more guidance for the Bank in the shape of unemployment and wages figures. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank of England will get a final look at how well the UK economy is doing this week starting today with the latest unemployment and wages data. Since the Bank of England deferred a decision on raising rates in May the UK economy has rebounded strongly from the slowdown seen in Q1 with a strong performance seen across all the major sectors, raising expectations that the monetary policy committee may coalesce around a majority decision to raise rates in just over a couple of weeks\u2019 time. </p> <p>This week\u2019s data could go some further in raising these expectations or dash them completely, unless Bank of England governor Mark Carney performs another one of his reverse ferrets this morning and pours cold water on the prospect when he speaks in Farnborough today, just prior to the release of this morning\u2019s data. </p> <p>Despite all the recent reports of job losses in the retail sector, thus far we\u2019ve seen little evidence of an impact in the headline unemployment numbers, though that could change in the coming months. </p> <p>For now, unemployment is expected to remain unchanged at 4.2%, while on the wages front there has been evidence that the recent rise in the private sector wages has been slowing a touch, though with inflation slipping back to 2.4% we are now seeing wages outstrip prices. This looks set to remain the case in today\u2019s numbers with weekly average earnings for the three months to May expected to fall slightly from 2.8% to 2.7%. </p> </blockquote> <p>On the markets, Wall Street ended slightly higher but after the close Netflix shares fell 14% following badly received results. So European markets are expected to make an uncertain start. Analysts at London Capital Group expect the FTSE 100 to open 3 points higher at 7603, Germany\u2019s Dax to open 3 points lower at 12558 and France\u2019s Cac to dip 1 point to 5407.</p> <p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p> <p>9.00 BST Bank of England governor before Treasury Select Committee</p> <p>9.30 BST UK unemployment and wages data</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-07-17T07:05:58.546Z\">at 8.05am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of women holding the most senior jobs in the boardrooms of Britain\u2019s biggest companies has fallen, according to a report that criticises the lack of progress made by businesses in getting more women to the top. Analysis from Cranfield University, as part of its 20th FTSE Women on Boards Report, shows a sharp drop in the number of women occupying chief executive (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO) or other executive roles on FTSE 250 boards, and static numbers at FTSE 100 companies. Companies have, however, done better at promoting women to part-time non-executive directorships in order to meet targets; many women now hold a number of such boardroom roles. There are now just 30 women in full-time executive roles at FTSE 250 firms, down from 38 last year \u2013 amounting to 6.4% of the total. They include six female chief executives and 19 female chief financial officers. Property firm Grainger stands out with women holding the chief executive and CFO jobs. The report described this as a \u201cwoeful situation\u201d, especially because the FTSE 250 - which largely consists of mid-sized UK-focused businesses - is often viewed as the pipeline for jobs at larger FTSE 100 companies. On FTSE 100 boards, the percentage of women in leadership positions has flatlined for a fourth year at 9.7%. There are 25 women holding executive roles at 22 companies, the same as in 2017, with seven female chief executives and 10 female CFOs. Just three companies have two women in executive roles: Costa Coffee owner Whitbread and retailers Kingfisher and Next. Moya Greene has stepped down from her CEO role at Royal Mail but will stay on until September, leaving just six women in the top job across FTSE 100 companies. \u201cThe greatest concern raised in this report is the complete lack of progress in developing the female executive pipeline,\u201d the study said. \u201cWe see that countries with mandated quotas make change happen; we need to apply the same lesson inside companies and penalise managers who do not meet their internal targets for hiring and promoting women. Gender diversity is a serious business issue.\u201d Women are now in 29% of directors\u2019 seats on FTSE 100 boards, up from 27.7% in October 2017 because companies recruited more female non-executive directors; 264 women now hold 305 FTSE 100 directorships. At present, 32 FTSE 100 companies have reached the target of 33% women on their boards, set by the government-backed Alexander-Hampton review for 2020. Drinks group Diageo comes top with 55% women on its board, followed by Whitbread and stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown with 50%, and Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline and oil firm Royal Dutch Shell with 45% women on their boards. The percentage of women on FTSE 250 boards has risen slightly from 22.8% to 23.7%, but the number of all-male boards has risen to 10. They include retailer Sports Direct and infrastructure firm Stobart Group. The CBI director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, said: \u201cMore women are taking their place in FTSE boardrooms, but the truth is it\u2019s not happening fast enough. If the Hampton-Alexander target is to be met, much more needs to be done right now \u2013 particularly at senior levels below the executive team.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Extra health spending and a population that is ageing faster than previously expected will add to the burden of spending over the next 50 years, according to the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster. The \u00a320bn boost to the health budget by 2021-22 promised by Theresa May, coupled with falling immigration \u2013 which will cut the number of young and working-age people \u2013 will increase the public deficit unless the government moves to increase taxes or take other measures to reduce spending, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said. In a sweeping assessment of the financial risks faced by the government over the next 50 years, the OBR warned that the health budget was likely to rise to 8% of GDP by 2024 from the current level of just over 7%, and to 13.8% by the mid-2060s as the population ages at a faster rate and technological advances and increasing ill health among older people burden the health service with extra costs. The OBR chairman, Robert Chote, said a new assessment of patient need based on analysis in the US showed the population\u2019s increasing ill health from diabetes and other diseases would account for 1 percentage point of the rise to 13%. The triple lock on pensions and higher public sector pension costs would also add to the long-term bill. Chote said a fresh assessment of the student loan system also showed the government was underestimating the costs of higher education over the next 40 years. He said accounting rules used to assess the future liability on the public purse of student loans failed to take into account that repayments were linked to income and debts were written off after 30 years. These both reduced the level of liabilities and encouraged the Treasury to sell batches of loans at discount prices to the private sector. Overall, the government\u2019s total spending, excluding interest payments on the nation\u2019s debt, will rise from 36.4% in 2022-23 to 44.6% by 2067-68 under current projections. Last year the OBR said in its first fiscal risks report, which calculates the burden of public spending over the next 40 years, that the government would be unable to reach the target of a debt-to-GDP ratio of 40% without large tax rises or cuts to spending. An estimate last year of the impact of Brexit found the costs of leaving the European Union would wipe out most, if not all, of the savings from the UK\u2019s budget contributions. Chote said that without further clarity about the government\u2019s exit strategy, he was unable to say if Brexit would be more or less harmful than his first estimate. But he said that as a result of health spending commitments made by May last month that remained unfunded, the situation this year had worsened. The government has promised to fund much of the rise in health spending from the Brexit dividend that comes from not contributing to the EU budget. Last year the OBR said EU productivity levels would likely fall after Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, leading to lower tax revenues and wiping out most or all of the dividend. The Treasury said the government was committed to funding health spending \u201cin a responsible way\u201d. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cWe have made excellent progress reducing government borrowing by three-quarters and, as a result, our national debt is due to begin its first sustained fall in a generation. \u201cWe can be proud of this achievement, but \u2013 as today\u2019s reports clearly illustrate \u2013 we cannot be complacent. We must continue to deliver on our commitment to fix our public finances, and we must reject the arguments of those who think that debt can rise again without consequences.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government has reached a compromise with Labour over the legislation underpinning the new energy price cap, quashing fears the flagship policy would be delayed. A House of Lords amendment would have introduced a permanent relative price cap \u2013 a limit on the gap between energy firms\u2019 most expensive and cheapest tariffs \u2013 after the absolute cap ends. Such an indefinite cap would have been unacceptable to many Tory MPs. But after negotiations between energy minister Claire Perry and the the opposition that went on until late on Monday, an alternative was agreed that would oblige the energy regulator Ofgem to carry out a review before the absolute cap ends. That review will have to examine whether households face an excessive gap between expensive default tariffs and cheaper fixed rates, after the cap is lifted in 2020, or in 2023 if competition is deemed not to be working. The government amendment also requires Ofgem to explore whether vulnerable customers need further protection after the cap. Alan Whitehead, Labour\u2019s shadow energy minister, said: \u201cAfter long delays the government is finally bringing Labour\u2019s energy price cap idea into law.\u201d John Penrose, a Conservative MP who had backed a relative cap, said the compromise went far enough to satisfy him. \u201cThis last-ditch change finally addresses the central \u2018tease and squeeze\u2019 rip-off that\u2019s sneakily leaving people on ultra-high default tariffs, and was the original reason for introducing the bill in the first place. \u201cIt means that, if an absolute price cap doesn\u2019t fix the problem properly, Ofgem can\u2019t just ignore it like they did before.\u201d The comparison site uSwitch said the agreement was a more sensible approach than a relative cap. The victory for ministers means there should be no delay to the cap coming into effect this winter, unless one of the big six energy suppliers launches a legal challenge against the government. Perry recently wrote to the firms to warn them against such a course of action, which she said would risk \u201cdamaging the reputation of the whole sector\u201d. In her letter, she told bosses: \u201cThe government will strongly condemn any efforts to frustrate the process of putting the cap in place.\u201d The legislation underpinning the price cap is not expected to be affected by the prospect of an early parliamentary recess on Thursday, government sources said, because the bill should be passed by the Commons late on Wednesday afternoon.",

      "bodyText": "The rate of pay growth for British workers has fallen to the lowest level in six months, despite record numbers of people in work across the country, official figures show. Heaping pressure on the Bank of England to delay raising interest rates from as early as August, the latest snapshot for the British labour market showed the lowest level of unemployment since the mid-1970s was yet to help workers demand higher rates of pay. High rates of employment and low levels of unemployment usually signal rising wages. The Office for National Statistics said average weekly earnings rose by 2.5% on the year in the three months to May, slowing down from the previous three months when they grew by 2.6%. Pay growth excluding bonuses slowed to 2.7%. There have been signs of recovery in the British economy that could tempt the Bank to raise interest rates from as early as next month to counter persistently high levels of inflation since the EU referendum two years ago. Having shuddered to a standstill during the freezing weather earlier this year, the economy rebounded in May thanks to warmer weather and the royal wedding. The Bank has previously said it would raise rates should the economy continue to improve. The disappointing figures for pay growth came despite unemployment remaining at 4.2%, which was the joint lowest level since May 1975. Lower numbers of people out of work should help workers demand higher pay, but some economists say the creation of low-paid and precarious jobs since the financial crisis has damaged the link between low levels of unemployment and wage growth. The latest snapshot from the ONS shows the British economy added a further 137,000 jobs, taking the number of people in work to a record high of 32.4 million. Unfilled vacancies stood at a record high of 824,000, amid falls in migration to the UK from the EU after the Brexit vote. Esther McVey, the secretary of state for work and pensions, said more than 3 million people had entered the workforce since 2010. \u201cThe eight-year trend shows the vast majority of roles are in full-time, permanent work that\u2019s higher skilled \u2013 which means higher paid too,\u201d she said. However, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, said millions of workers were \u201cstruggling to get by\u201d, while the government was cutting in-work benefits. The figures from the ONS show real wages are continuing to rise, although only due to falling levels of inflation in recent months. While some economists forecast there will be greater pay rises just around the corner, there are also expectations that inflation will increase as a result of higher petrol prices. While the mixed signals from the labour market might deter the Bank from raising interest rates, many economists said Threadneedle Street could still go ahead given stronger economic growth in recent months. Should the central bank delay, it could create greater levels of Brexit uncertainty ahead of the UK formally leaving the EU next March. Researchers at the Resolution Foundation said the Bank would need to decide if the poor rate of pay growth was \u201csimply as good as it gets\u201d given the weak growth in the productivity of workers seen across Britain since the 2008 financial crisis. Stephen Clarke, a senior economic analyst at the thinktank, said: \u201cThe news for people once they are in work is less positive, as pay growth continues to disappoint.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Royal Mail has reported a further fall in the number of letters it delivers for businesses, after new data privacy laws reduced the amount of junk mail sent. In a trading update ahead of its annual meeting in Sheffield on Thursday, where it could face a shareholder revolt over executive pay, the FTSE 100 company said letter revenues fell 7% in the three months to 24 June, with volumes down 6%. Excluding the boost from last year\u2019s election mailings, letter revenues declined 5% year on year. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), introduced in May to protect European citizens from the misuse of their personal data, has deterred some businesses from sending junk mail, said Royal Mail. \u201cWe are monitoring any potential impact closely,\u201d it said. \u201cWe continue to work with customers to find solutions for their marketing mail needs.\u201d The group warned in May that the number of letters delivered would fall by between 4% and 6% this year. It said on Tuesday: \u201cDue to the potential impact of GDPR and, or, if business uncertainty persists, we still expect to be at the higher end of the range of decline for 2018-19 and may fall outside the range in a period.\u201d Royal Mail\u2019s parcel revenues rose 6% in the quarter, boosted by the growth of e-commerce. Overall revenues at its UK business fell by 1%. Royal Mail also has an international parcels business, where volumes rose 10% and revenues were up 11%. The outgoing Royal Mail chief executive, Moya Greene, will step down from the board after the AGM. The postal service has come under fire for awarding her successor, Rico Back, who took over in June, a \u00a3640,000 salary, 16.8% higher than Greene\u2019s. Two influential investor advisory groups have also called on shareholders to oppose Greene\u2019s \u00a3900,000 termination bonus. The company said Back\u2019s and Greene\u2019s overall fixed pay, including pension and benefits, was broadly the same. It defended the bonus for Greene, calling her an \u201cexceptional executive\u201d. Royal Mail had been locked into a long dispute with the Communication Workers Union over pay, pensions and conditions, but Greene struck a deal in February, and Royal Mail said it was making progress with trials and initiatives under the agreement. Back added that the company was working with the union and the government on the introduction of a collective defined contribution pension plan, to replace the more expensive final salary scheme closed this year. Ed Monk, the associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing\u2019s share dealing service, said the company \u201cscored a big victory\u201d when it persuaded the union to back its pension plans. \u201cIt may not be enough, however, to soothe investors who have been increasingly wary that Royal Mail can\u2019t win all its battles,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shares have fallen by a fifth in the past two months.\u201d Richard Hunter, the head of markets at online trading platform Interactive Investor, said: \u201cThe fact that letters and cards are slowly being consigned to history has long been known, but Royal Mail has, for the most part, been able to replace this lost business within a burgeoning parcels market. In particular, its European business, GLS, continues to shine.\u201d However, he flagged rising competition in parcels delivery from Deutsche Post and Amazon. Royal Mail shares rose 3.5% in early trading.",

      "body": "<p>Royal Mail has reported a further fall in the number of letters it delivers for businesses, after new data privacy laws reduced the amount of junk mail sent.</p> <p>In a trading update ahead of its annual meeting in Sheffield on Thursday, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/15/investors-deliver-rebuke-royal-mail-executive-greed-fat-cat-pay\">it could face a shareholder revolt over executive pay</a>, the FTSE 100 company said letter revenues fell 7% in the three months to 24 June, with volumes down 6%. Excluding the boost from last year\u2019s election mailings, letter revenues declined 5% year on year.</p> <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), introduced in May to protect European citizens from the misuse of their personal data, has deterred some businesses from sending junk mail, said Royal Mail. </p> <p>\u201cWe are monitoring any potential impact closely,\u201d it said. \u201cWe continue to work with customers to find solutions for their marketing mail needs.\u201d</p> <p>The group warned in May that the number of letters delivered would fall by between 4% and 6% this year. It said on Tuesday: \u201cDue to the potential impact of GDPR and, or, if business uncertainty persists, we still expect to be at the higher end of the range of decline for 2018-19 and may fall outside the range in a period.\u201d</p> <p>Royal Mail\u2019s parcel revenues rose 6% in the quarter, boosted by the growth of e-commerce. Overall revenues at its UK business fell by 1%. Royal Mail also has an international parcels business, where volumes rose 10% and revenues were up 11%.</p> <p>The outgoing Royal Mail chief executive, Moya Greene, will <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/20/royal-mail-moya-greene-to-step-down-as-chief-executive-rico-back\">step down from the board after the AGM</a>. The postal service has come under fire <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/15/investors-deliver-rebuke-royal-mail-executive-greed-fat-cat-pay\">for awarding her successor, Rico Back</a>, who took over in June, a \u00a3640,000 salary, 16.8% higher than Greene\u2019s. Two influential investor advisory groups have also called on shareholders to oppose Greene\u2019s \u00a3900,000 termination bonus.</p> <p>The company said Back\u2019s and Greene\u2019s overall fixed pay, including pension and benefits, was broadly the same. It defended the bonus for Greene, calling her an \u201cexceptional executive\u201d.</p> <p>Royal Mail had been locked into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/09/royal-mail-postal-strike-october-union-pension-pay-jobs\">long dispute with the Communication Workers Union</a> over pay, pensions and conditions, but <a href=\"https://www.cwu.org/news/cwu-reaches-deal-royal-mail/\">Greene struck a deal in February</a>, and Royal Mail said it was making progress with trials and initiatives under the agreement.</p> <p>Back added that the company was working with the union and the government on the introduction of a collective defined contribution pension plan, to replace the more expensive final salary scheme closed this year.</p> <p>Ed Monk, the associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing\u2019s share dealing service, said the company \u201cscored a big victory\u201d when it persuaded the union to back its pension plans. \u201cIt may not be enough, however, to soothe investors who have been increasingly wary that Royal Mail can\u2019t win all its battles,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shares have fallen by a fifth in the past two months.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richard Hunter, the head of markets at online trading platform Interactive Investor, said: \u201cThe fact that letters and cards are slowly being consigned to history has long been known, but Royal Mail has, for the most part, been able to replace this lost business within a burgeoning parcels market. In particular, its European business, GLS, continues to shine.\u201d</p> <p>However, he flagged rising competition in parcels delivery from Deutsche Post and Amazon.</p> <p>Royal Mail shares rose 3.5% in early trading.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s energy watchdog has sounded the alarm over a \u201cworrying\u201d pause in the shift to clean energy after global investment in renewables fell 7% to $318bn (\u00a3240bn) last year. The International Energy Agency said the decline is set to continue into 2018, threatening energy security, climate change and air pollution goals. Fossil fuels increased their share of energy supply investment for the first time since 2014, to $790bn, and will play a significant role for years on current trends, the IEA said. Investment in coal power dropped sharply but was offset by an uptick in oil and gas spending, the World Energy Investment report found. Dr Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said of the renewables fall: \u201cWe are seeing a decrease, which is disappointing. And more disappointing is we see the signs this decline may continue this year \u2013 this is a worrying trend.\u201d Fossil fuels\u2019 share of energy investment needs to drop to 40% by 2030 to meet climate targets but instead rose fractionally to 59% in 2017. World leaders\u2019 warm words on renewables and energy efficiency needed to be matched with action, Birol said, urging governments to create less investment uncertainty for green energy. \u201cI was myself worried to see there is a contradiction between a) the statements the governments make and b) what the world needs today vis-a-vis the investment numbers, where we see a decline,\u201d he said. Globally, energy investment fell 2% to $1.8tn in 2017, with electricity taking a bigger share than oil and gas for the second year in a row. The decline in renewable power generation spending was mostly down to falls in wind power and hydro but solar hit record levels despite becoming cheaper to install. While coal investment fell to its lowest level in 10 years, spending on gas-fired power stations rose 40%. Nuclear power fell sharply to the lowest level of investment in five years. In the oil and gas industry, rising prices have helped investment in production rise 4% last year and is expected to grow 5% this year. The US\u2019s shale boom will drive much of the growth, and frackers are on track to achieve positive free cashflow this year, for the first time. The US is not expected to pump enough extra crude to bring down oil prices, though. Birol said: \u201cUS shale growth is very welcome growth for badly needed additions but this growth alone will not be enough to balance out the markets.\u201d Outside the US, investment in conventional oil and gas projects remains subdued and Birol said the world faced \u201cmajor difficulties\u201d if investment was not stepped up. Motorists spent $43bn on fully electric cars and plug-in hybrids last year, accounting for half of global growth in car sales. However, the battery-powered cars are not seriously denting oil demand yet, the IEA said. Governments are increasing investment in energy markets, either directly through state-owned firms or indirectly via investments policies and regulation, which Birol said was a surprising development.",
