      "bodyText": "The row over Marmite has highlighted the sensitivity of the price of everyday items to fluctuations in the value of the pound. A range of goods are expected to rise in price over the next year, as cost rises for retailers gradually filter through to the shop floor. Clothing The majority of clothing sold in the UK is made overseas and is paid for by retailers in dollars and so the 17.5% fall in the value of the pound against the US currency will have a major impact on fashion retailer\u2019s costs. Analysts believe retailers are likely to see an increase in cost prices on clothing of between 8% and 10% by next year. Wine With 99% of all wine consumed in the UK imported, prices of one of the UK\u2019s favourite tipples are expected to rise considerably. Some contracts have been agreed in euros and so price rises will already have automatically filtered through. Others will have cut long term contracts with suppliers and so may not see a rise for some months. In the three months to 11 September wine prices in shops fell 2.4%, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel, although this was partly down to shoppers choosing to swap to cheaper options \u2013 for example buying prosecco instead of champagne. Petrol Oil is priced in dollars, and so the price of petrol at the pump in the UK has already risen. According to the Petrol Retailers Association wholesale costs to retailers have increased by more than 6p per litre for petrol and 7ppl for diesel in the past few weeks. Heavy competition in the market \u2013 with cheap petrol used as a draw by supermarkets who operate a large number of forecourts \u2013 has meant average pump prices in the UK have moved up by less than 2ppl for both grades over the same time period. But the PRA has warned motorists can expect further increases. Bread As the traditional chains have fought back against the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, bread prices have fallen significantly over the past two years. That may be changing. About 85% of wheat used in UK bread is homegrown, but that can depend heavily on the quality of harvests. Other ingredients and elements such as plastic packaging may have risen in cost. Kantar recorded a 0.8% rise in bread prices in the three months to 11 September. Milk Milk prices have been under pressure for the past two and a half years as the supermarket price war has raged, prompting farmers to protest last summer. The price they are paid per fell as low as 16p but has now risen slightly to about 20p. The fall in the value of the pound is likely to push up the price of dairy products from abroad. Bananas Fruit and other exotic products that cannot be grown in Britain have to be imported from abroad and there\u2019s none more popular than bananas. Priced in dollars, cost prices are likely to rise significantly for retailers and suppliers. Last month, Dublin-based importer Fyffes said it had absorbed a 20% increase in fruit purchasing costs because of the appreciation of the dollar. But price competition between the chains will ensure they will try to keep a lid on increases for shoppers.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What a shame, Tesco and Unilever have declared peace just as the great Marmite bust-up was getting exciting. In round two, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, could have pointed out that Unilever has grown fat on profit margins of 14.9% and contrasted his old employer\u2019s easy life with his own struggle to restore the supermarket chain\u2019s margins to even 3%. Or he could have alleged that Unilever\u2019s strong-arm tactics were not simply currency-inspired but flowed from the weaker rate of sales growth revealed on Thursday in Unilever\u2019s third-quarter trading update. Or he could have argued that the company was trying to milk the great British shopper to fund expansion in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Now will we be denied such entertainment. Mutual self-interest was always likely to prevail but Lewis\u2019s determination to fight to the point where stocks of Marmite and other Unilever goods ran low is admirable. After sterling\u2019s fall, there will many companies trying to force through unmerited price increases under the cover of Brexit. It\u2019s impossible to know how guilty Unilever was on that score. It would be silly to deny the company\u2019s right to try to pass on some of the higher costs from commodities and dollar- and euro-denominated packaging, but an alleged 10% across-the-board price hike did indeed look too much, too soon. Lewis worked at Unilever for 27 years and will have a keen sense of when his former colleagues have overplayed their hand. From a tactical point of view, he played a blinder in positioning Tesco as stout defender of UK consumers\u2019 interests. It makes a welcome change after his predecessors at the grocer spent a decade bleeding UK shoppers to fund their wasteful foreign adventures in the US, China and eastern Europe. Who won the Marmite scrap? We\u2019ll never be told the details of the settlement, but one suspects Tesco had the better of the skirmish because Unilever, a company that can come across as holier-than-thou at times, was ill-prepared for a dirty public fight. In the long run, though, Unilever\u2019s profit margins will remain considerably plumper than Tesco\u2019s. Yet more blue-sky thinking over Murdoch revolt Dad controls 39% of the shares, so James Murdoch\u2019s job as chairman of Sky is safe. Yet 50.6% of outside shareholders want him out, a result more embarrassing than the satellite broadcaster (and Murdoch Jr) would have expected. Naturally, the company\u2019s reaction was to blame the dissenters for being box-ticking ignoramuses. Sky, taking a well-trodden path, thinks US investors rely too heavily on proxy advisory agencies like ISS, which is wedded to the idea that a chairman should be independent, which Murdoch obviously isn\u2019t. It promises to \u201cengage\u201d with the shareholders directly \u2013 shorthand for telling them why they are wrong. Such a bull-headed reaction was predictable; and, yes, it would be a good thing if shareholders did not outsource their thinking to third parties. But Sky should look in the mirror. When contemplating a new chairman in January, the company didn\u2019t bother to consult outside shareholders and instead presented the return of Murdoch as a done deal. Given the history \u2013 the failed bid by News Corp (now 21st Century Fox) in 2011 and the phone-hacking scandal at News International that contributed to Murdoch\u2019s resignation from Sky \u2013 the lack of consultation was arrogant. It is nice to know Sky is now in a mood to talk. But the right moment to do so was before the appointment was signed off. If Sky had done so, it might have converted a majority of independent shareholders to its way of thinking. The board brought the embarrassment on itself. Two reasons to pause over Sir Philip Green de-gonging Sir Philip Green was warned often enough that his knighthood would be at risk if he did not make good on his promise to \u201csort\u201d the deficit in the BHS pension fund. Six months have passed since the chain collapsed so he can hardly be surprised that MPs have decided to vote on his de-gonging. The honours forfeiture committee has the final say, but a recommendation by MPs would carry weight. It would also be popular. And, yes, if Green intends to shirk responsibilities to BHS pensioners that he has acknowledged, an honour for \u201cservices to retail\u201d would be a nonsense. But there are two reasons to hesitate at this time. First, are MPs sure the foot-dragging is all down to Green? The Pensions Regulator, with whom negotiations continue about a settlement, is not famed for being speedy. Second, if Green is de-gonged, he might descend into an even bigger sulk and persuade himself he has been wronged. Better to tell him how much he owes, and set a deadline for payment \u2013 then decide on the knighthood.",

In round two, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, could have pointed out that Unilever has grown fat on profit margins of 14.9% and contrasted his old employer\u2019s easy life with his own struggle to restore the supermarket chain\u2019s margins to even 3%.</p> <p>Or he could have alleged that Unilever\u2019s strong-arm tactics were not simply currency-inspired but flowed from the weaker rate of sales growth revealed on Thursday in Unilever\u2019s third-quarter trading update. Or he could have argued that the company was trying to milk the great British shopper to fund expansion in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America.</p> <p>Now will we be denied such entertainment. Mutual self-interest was always likely to prevail but Lewis\u2019s determination to fight to the point where stocks of Marmite and other Unilever goods ran low is admirable. After sterling\u2019s fall, there will many companies trying to force through unmerited price increases under the cover of Brexit.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible to know how guilty Unilever was on that score. It would be silly to deny the company\u2019s right to try to pass on some of the higher costs from commodities and dollar- and euro-denominated packaging, but an alleged 10% across-the-board price hike did indeed look too much, too soon. Lewis worked at Unilever for 27 years and will have a keen sense of when his former colleagues have overplayed their hand.</p> <p>From a tactical point of view, he played a blinder in positioning Tesco as stout defender of UK consumers\u2019 interests. It makes a welcome change after his predecessors at the grocer spent a decade bleeding UK shoppers to fund their wasteful foreign adventures in the US, China and eastern Europe.</p> <p>Who won the Marmite scrap? We\u2019ll never be told the details of the settlement, but one suspects Tesco had the better of the skirmish because Unilever, a company that can come across as holier-than-thou at times, was ill-prepared for a dirty public fight. In the long run, though, Unilever\u2019s profit margins will remain considerably plumper than Tesco\u2019s.</p> <h2>Yet more blue-sky thinking over Murdoch revolt</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"047bcf1074f4529f34e9f29c096d38f5aedbfa69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/047bcf1074f4529f34e9f29c096d38f5aedbfa69/0_149_2358_1415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Murdoch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Murdoch, Sky chairman.

Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/sky-shareholders-revolt-against-james-murdoch-appointment-chairman-agm\">50.6% of outside shareholders want him out</a>, a result more embarrassing than the satellite broadcaster (and Murdoch Jr) would have expected.</p> <p> Naturally, the company\u2019s reaction was to blame the dissenters for being box-ticking ignoramuses. Sky, taking a well-trodden path, thinks US investors rely too heavily on proxy advisory agencies like ISS, which is wedded to the idea that a chairman should be independent, which Murdoch obviously isn\u2019t. It promises to \u201cengage\u201d with the shareholders directly \u2013 shorthand for telling them why they are wrong.</p> <p>Such a bull-headed reaction was predictable; and, yes, it would be a good thing if shareholders did not outsource their thinking to third parties. But Sky should look in the mirror. When contemplating a new chairman in January, the company didn\u2019t bother to consult outside shareholders and instead presented the return of Murdoch as a done deal.</p> <p>Given the history \u2013 the failed bid by News Corp (now 21st Century Fox) in 2011 and the phone-hacking scandal at News International that contributed to Murdoch\u2019s resignation from Sky \u2013 the lack of consultation was arrogant.</p> <p>It is nice to know Sky is now in a mood to talk. But the right moment to do so was before the appointment was signed off. If Sky had done so, it might have converted a majority of independent shareholders to its way of thinking. The board brought the embarrassment on itself.</p> <h2>Two reasons to pause over Sir Philip Green de-gonging</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b0c5737e17a944dfb187816a59f69adc0d0fdb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b0c5737e17a944dfb187816a59f69adc0d0fdb3/0_33_1443_866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Green gives evidence to the Commons business select committee on the collapse of BHS in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Green gives evidence to the Commons business select committee on the collapse of BHS in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sir Philip Green was warned often enough that his knighthood would be at risk if he did not make good on his promise to \u201csort\u201d the deficit in the BHS pension fund. Six months have passed since the chain collapsed so he can hardly be surprised that MPs have decided to vote on his de-gonging.</p> <p>The honours forfeiture committee has the final say, but a recommendation by MPs would carry weight. It would also be popular. And, yes, if Green intends to shirk responsibilities to BHS pensioners that he has acknowledged, an honour for \u201cservices to retail\u201d would be a nonsense.</p> <p>But there are two reasons to hesitate at this time. First, are MPs sure the foot-dragging is all down to Green? The Pensions Regulator, with whom negotiations continue about a settlement, is not famed for being speedy. Second, if Green is de-gonged, he might descend into an even bigger sulk and persuade himself he has been wronged. Better to tell him how much he owes, and set a deadline for payment \u2013 then decide on the knighthood.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unilever has resolved its dispute with Tesco and says well-known brands including Marmite and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s will be back on the shelves. It emerged on Wednesday that Tesco was running short of stock of a range of household brands from Marmite to Comfort fabric conditioner after a row with its major supplier. The consumer brands company halted deliveries to Tesco after the supermarket refused to stump up across-the-board price rises of about 10% for its range of brands. However, after both companies\u2019 share prices fell on Thursday and Unilever was criticised for blaming the attempt to increase prices on the fall in the value of the pound, a deal was reached late in the afternoon. The food and household goods supplier said: \u201cUnilever is pleased to confirm that the supply situation with Tesco in the UK and Ireland has now been successfully resolved. \u201cWe have been working together closely to reach this resolution and ensure our much-loved brands are once again fully available. For all those that missed us, thanks for all the love.\u201d A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cWe always put our customers first and we are pleased this has been resolved to our satisfaction.\u201d The statement appears to suggest the two sides reached a compromise, although neither Tesco nor Unilever would confirm any details of their talks. The quick resolution of the row is good news for Tesco\u2019s boss, Dave Lewis, who previously held a senior role at Unilever. Tesco shares slid 3% and Unilever shares dropped 3.4% as City investors were alarmed at pictures of empty shelves appearing on social media. But analysts said the public spat had worked out well for the supermarket, as tabloid newspapers widely portrayed Tesco as a people\u2019s champion on low prices. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw articles about Tesco as the shoppers\u2019 champion?\u201d said Dave McCarthy, a food retail analyst at HSBC. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said the publicity around the spat was probably helpful to both Tesco and Unilever as it would help explain probable price rises to shoppers. \u201cTesco recognises that Unilever\u2019s costs have gone up \u2013 there is no doubt about it \u2013 but they wanted to argue a little bit. The government doesn\u2019t really want to publicise the negative impact of Brexit. Now Tesco can say \u2018look how we fought for you\u2019,\u201d he said. Despite the swift resolution of the Marmite standoff, UK consumers have been told to brace themselves for price rises. Other negotiations may be less public, but it\u2019s understood that a number of suppliers have approached supermarkets asking for cost increases to be covered. Monteyne predicts that food prices will rise by about 3% over time as the impact of the falling value of the pound is reflected on supermarket shelves. Pinar Hosafci, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor International, said: \u201cBrexit has been a trigger that started this and it is likely that other companies, which are reporting in euros, including the likes of Nestl\u00e9 and Ferrero, will follow suit. This move could be more detrimental to Tesco than Unilever, which owns a number of power brands that are either leading or at best ranking in the second place.\u201d The British Retail Consortium said shops would be doing their best to hold down prices for customers, but that the impact of the falling pound would eventually work its way through to shelf prices. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cRetailers are firmly on the side of consumers in negotiating with suppliers and improving efficiencies in the supply chain to control the inflationary pressure that is building through the devaluation of the pound. \u201cHowever, years of falling shop prices and higher costs have left limited scope for retailers to continue absorbing this pressure, and everyone in the supply chain will need to play their part in maintaining low prices for consumers.\u201d Unilever is one of Britain\u2019s biggest suppliers of branded food and household goods and claims its products are found in 98% of UK households. Its brands also include Dove, Hellmann\u2019s, Magnum, Persil, Vaseline and PG Tips. The company had blamed the pound\u2019s fall against the euro and the dollar since the Brexit vote, which pushes up the cost of imports, for the 10% price rise demand. However, this attracted criticism as most of its products are made in the UK. Earlier on Thursday Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer, said price increases to offset rising costs were a normal part of doing business. \u201cWe are taking price increases in the UK. That is a normal devaluation-led cycle,\u201d he said. The big supermarkets are likely to fight particularly hard to prevent price rises as they are battling to stop consumers taking their trade to discounters Aldi and Lidl, which sell more own-brand goods. Downing Street declined to comment on how retailers and suppliers should respond to the fall in sterling. A spokesman for Theresa May said: \u201cIt is a decision for companies how they market and sell their products \u2026 It is a commercial decision.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Sky shareholders revolt against James Murdoch's appointment as chairman", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 50% of Sky\u2019s independent shareholders have voted against James Murdoch\u2019s reappointment as chairman. The head of the pan-European broadcaster had to rely on the support of Sky\u2019s largest shareholder, 21st Century Fox, to win approval for his return to Sky after a four-year hiatus. Murdoch is chief executive of 21st Century Fox, the centre of his father Rupert Murdoch\u2019s film, media and TV empire. Sky said it noted the \u201csignificant vote\u201d against the resolution and would engage with shareholders who opposed Murdoch\u2019s appointment. It said the Sky board\u2019s decision to reappoint James as chairman \u201cwas unanimous and recognised that he is a highly experienced executive with extensive knowledge of the international media industry and has been a strong contributor to Sky since he joined the board in 2003\u201d. It added that with Martin Gilbert as deputy chairman and Andrew Sukawaty as senior independent director \u201cthere are strong governance processes in place to protect the interests of independent shareholders\u201d. The broadcaster promised to \u201cengage with those shareholders who voted against the resolution\u201d. Murdoch\u2019s reappointment was approved by 71.55%, when Fox\u2019s shareholding is taken into account. Excluding Fox\u2019s stake, but including shareholders who made a positive decision to abstain from the vote, some 50.9% of shareholders failed to support Murdoch\u2019s appointment. Fox owns a 39.14% stake in Sky. Murdoch had been forced to stand down as chairman of Sky in 2012 after the phone hacking scandal at News International, publisher of the Sun, Times, Sunday Times and now defunct News of the World, where he had also been chairman. However, he remained as a non-executive director at Sky, and was the only candidate put forward by its nominations committee to take over as chairman from Nick Ferguson. Before the annual shareholders meeting in west London, Royal London Asset Management, which owns \u00a352m of Sky shares, and a number of shareholder advisory firms urged a vote against Murdoch. They argued that the satellite broadcaster needed an independent chairman and criticised the process by which he was reappointed earlier this year. Speaking to the Guardian at the AGM, Murdoch dismissed concerns about the conflict of interest of his role, admitting he was not an independent director. \u201cI\u2019m not an independent director, being associated with the major shareholder,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw there were no questions from shareholders here. So it\u2019s not for me to comment.\u201d Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said the vote of independent shareholders against Murdoch as chairman was a significant moment that drew parallels with the recent corporate governance controversy at Sports Direct. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s a major embarrassment for the board of Sky that they couldn\u2019t get a majority of independent shareholders to support their candidate for chair. This is a highly significant vote. James Murdoch will have to work very hard indeed to win back the confidence of shareholders. The Sports Direct debacle has demonstrated the financial risk of rotten corporate governance and of losing the confidence of your shareholders.\u201d Murdoch was appointed by a three-member committee of Sky directors, including new deputy chairman Martin Gilbert, the chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management and Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, who stood down as a Sky non-executive director after the shareholder meeting. Piers Hillier, the chief investment officer at Royal London, said: \u201cNo attempts were made to advertise the position externally, or appoint an agency, which goes against the UK corporate governance code.\u201d The Fox TV, film and entertainment business was spun out of News Corp as a separately listed company in 2013. News International, which was rebranded News UK in the same year, is part of News Corp, the newspaper company founded by Murdoch\u2019s father, Rupert. The Murdoch family was forced to give up on an \u00a38bn-plus News Corp bid to take full control of Sky in 2011 as the fallout from the phone hacking scandal made it too politically difficult to complete. There has been speculation that Fox will launch another bid for full control of Sky and Murdoch was asked at the AGM about a potential renewed bid. Murdoch said the meeting was not the forum to talk about \u201chypothetical scenarios\u201d but added that Sky had \u201crobust processes and procedures in place to deal with any related party transactions\u201d. Sky decided against informing or consulting shareholders about the appointment of Murdoch, although there is no legal corporate governance requirement to do so. In the four years since he moved into a non-executive directorship, investors have never voted against his reappointment at an annual general meeting.",

Excluding Fox\u2019s stake, but including shareholders who made a positive decision to abstain from the vote, some 50.9% of shareholders failed to support Murdoch\u2019s appointment. Fox owns a 39.14% stake in Sky.</p> <p>Murdoch had been forced to stand down as chairman of Sky in 2012 after the phone hacking scandal at News International, publisher of the Sun, Times, Sunday Times and now defunct News of the World, where he had also been chairman.</p> <p>However, he remained as a non-executive director at Sky, and was the only candidate put forward by its nominations committee to take over as chairman from Nick Ferguson.</p> <p>Before the annual shareholders meeting in west London, Royal London Asset Management, which owns \u00a352m of Sky shares, and a number of shareholder advisory firms <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/sky-shareholder-royal-london-asset-management-james-murdoch-replaced-chairman\"> urged a vote against Murdoch</a>.

So it\u2019s not for me to comment.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said the vote of independent shareholders against Murdoch as chairman was a significant moment that drew parallels with the recent corporate governance controversy at Sports Direct. </p> <p>She said: \u201cIt\u2019s a major embarrassment for the board of Sky that they couldn\u2019t get a majority of independent shareholders to support their candidate for chair. This is a highly significant vote. James Murdoch will have to work very hard indeed to win back the confidence of shareholders. The Sports Direct debacle has demonstrated the financial risk of rotten corporate governance and of losing the confidence of your shareholders.\u201d</p> <p>Murdoch was appointed by a three-member committee of Sky directors, including new deputy chairman Martin Gilbert, the chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management and Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, who stood down as a Sky non-executive director after the shareholder meeting.</p> <p>Piers Hillier, the chief investment officer at Royal London, said: \u201cNo attempts were made to advertise the position externally, or appoint an agency, which goes against the UK corporate governance code.\u201d </p> <p>The Fox TV, film and entertainment business was spun out of News Corp as a separately listed company in 2013. News International, which was rebranded News UK in the same year, is part of News Corp, the newspaper company founded by Murdoch\u2019s father, Rupert. </p> <p>The Murdoch family was forced to give up on an \u00a38bn-plus News Corp bid to take full control of Sky in 2011 as the fallout from the phone hacking scandal made it too politically difficult to complete.</p> <p>There has been speculation that Fox will launch another bid for full control of Sky and Murdoch was asked at the AGM about a potential renewed bid. Murdoch said the meeting was not the forum to talk about \u201chypothetical scenarios\u201d but added that Sky had \u201crobust processes and procedures in place to deal with any related party transactions\u201d.</p> <p>Sky decided against informing or consulting shareholders about the appointment of Murdoch, although there is no legal corporate governance requirement to do so. In the four years since he moved into a non-executive directorship, investors have never voted against his reappointment at an annual general meeting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With peace broken out in the Great Brexit price war (for the moment), it\u2019s time to wrap up for the day. Although ice cream and yeast spreads are trivial compared to, say Aleppo, today\u2019s drama has brought home the consequences of the slump in the pound since June. Here\u2019s our latest news story: Tesco and Unilever settle Marmite dispute Unilever has resolved its dispute with Tesco and says well-known brands including Marmite and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s will be back on the shelves. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, the food and household goods supplier said: \u201cUnilever is pleased to confirm that the supply situation with Tesco in the UK and Ireland has now been successfully resolved. \u201cWe have been working together closely to reach this resolution and ensure our much-loved brands are once again fully available. For all those that missed us, thanks for all the love.\u201d It emerged on Wednesday that Tesco was running low on a range of household brands from Marmite to Comfort fabric conditioner after a row with its major supplier. Unilever halted deliveries to Tesco after the supermarket refused to stump up across-the-board price rises of about 10% for its brands. A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cWe always put our customers first and we are pleased this has been resolved to our satisfaction.\u201d The statement appears to suggest the two sides reached a compromise, although neither Tesco nor Unilever would confirm any details of their talks. The quick resolution of the row is good news for Tesco\u2019s boss, Dave Lewis, who previously held a senior role at Unilever. Analysts said the public spat had worked out well for the supermarket, as tabloid newspapers widely portrayed Tesco as a people\u2019s champion on low prices. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw articles about Tesco as the shoppers\u2019 champion,\u201d said Dave McCarthy, a food retail analyst at HSBC.... More here: Thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight! GW Associated Press also found limited sympathy for Unilever, as it struggles to cope with the consequences of Brexit. Here\u2019s some of their latest report: Philip Walker spreads Marmite on his daily crumpet and stockpiles jars of the yeast spread. He\u2019s a fan, and he\u2019s upset at plans to raise the price of this icon of the British breakfast table. Love it or hate it, Marmite has become the most visible sign yet of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union after consumer giant Unilever sought to raise wholesale prices for its products by a reported 10% following a sharp drop in the pound. Tesco, the U.K.\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, has rejected the increase and removed many Unilever products from its website. #Marmitegate was not far behind. \u201cI am more angry at Unilever than I am at Tesco,\u201d said Walker, a 43-year-old regional manager for St. John Ambulance. \u201cIt seems Unilever is using Brexit as an excuse to hold Tesco customers to ransom.\u201d Tesco and Unilever will be glad to put this public spat behind them. But consumers should still brace for price hikes in the months ahead. A series of experts have warned today that the weak pound makes this inevitable, even though retailers will try to force suppliers to swallow the cost. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, summed it up: \u2018This pricing spat is likely to be the thin end of the wedge when it comes to relationships between UK retailers and their suppliers, in light of the pressures now applied by weaker sterling. This kind of friction is an inevitable result of the unstoppable force of higher import costs hitting the immovable object of UK retail pricing. Peace may have broken out, but Unilever products still aren\u2019t available on Tesco\u2019s website tonight: There were signs today that Unilever were losing the PR battle with Tesco -- even within the shadow of the Marmite factory. Reuters caught up with Jeaninne Richards, 69, a retired dressmaker and Brexit support, in the aisles of the Basildon Tesco, and was told: \u201cUnilever is being so greedy. They are using Brexit as an excuse ... If they take their products off the shelves, people are going to buy different products and then stick with it, so they are going to lose a lot of customers because of it.\u201d City AM\u2019s Jake Cordell suspects Unilever have caved in.... A spokesperson for Tesco has told the Guardian that: \u201cWe always put our customers first and we are pleased this has been resolved to our satisfaction\u201d They won\u2019t tell us how the situation has been resolved with Unilever. Our retail expert Sarah Butler suspects that the two sides have cut a deal..... Some snap reaction to the peace deal between Tesco and Unilever: The Great Marmite price war will go down as one of the shortest battles in UK business history. It\u2019s just 24 hours since the news broke that Tesco had pulled Unilever products from its website, after refusing to accept a 10% price hike to cover the slump in the pound. Since then, the issue has been on the front page of websites and newspapers, and trending on social media with taglines like #MarmiteGate and #Marmageddon. The dispute didn\u2019t impress investors in either company -- Tesco\u2019s shares slid by 3%, while Unilever saw 3.4% lopped off its value today. Clearly both sides risked losing out unless they came to a quick resolution. NEWSFLASH: The Brexit price wars are over. Unilever just issued a statement saying that the dispute with Tesco has been \u201csuccessfully\u201d resolved. The Anglo-Dutch group says: Unilever is pleased to confirm that the supply situation with Tesco in the UK and Ireland has now been successfully resolved. We have been working together closely to reach this resolution and ensure our much-loved brands are once again fully available. For all those that missed us, thanks for all the love. However, we don\u2019t (yet) know whether Unilever has abandoned its attempt to hike prices, or whether Tesco has agreed to the price increases, or whether the two sides have met in the middle. Donald Tusk\u2019s warning that Britain can\u2019t have a soft Brexit could worry UK firms. Trade insurance group Euler Hermes has warned that more companies would be driven under by a hard Brexit than a more conciliatory divorce. But either way, the prospects aren\u2019t great. The FT has the details: A hard Brexit \u2014 a complete break with no access to the single market \u2014 would increase the risk of more bankruptcies, it says. Under a soft Brexit it predicts that 25,170 businesses will fail in 2019. Under a hard Brexit that rises to 26,570. NEWSFLASH: Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, is dismissing the idea that Britain could secure a so-called soft Brexit. Speaking in Brussels, Tusk argues that Britain cannot expect to retain many of the benefits of EU membership while also leaving the bloc. Instead, he hinted that the prospect of a hard Brexit might force the UK to rethink leaving at all. Tusk says: \u201cIt is useless to speculate about \u2018soft Brexit. These would be purely theoretical speculations. In my opinion, the only real alternative to a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 is \u2018no Brexit\u2019. Even if today hardly anyone believes in such a possibility.\u201d Some UK ministers has argued that terms like \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 have little meaning, and that they could carve out a good deal that gave Britain access to the single market while also restricting migration. Tusk also seemed to rubbish the idea (popular with foreign secretary Boris Johnson) that Britain could have its Brexit cake and eat it. Hopefully there\u2019ll be Marmite on the table too.... Shares in Tesco and Unilever have both fallen today, as investors anticipated the Marmite price wars turning uglier. Tesco\u2019s shares fell 3% to 196p, while Unilever shed 3.4% to \u00a336.51. It\u2019s been a ropey day in the financial markets, as investors have fretted about the global economy. All the main European stock markets ended in the red, with the FTSE 100 dropping 46 points to 6977. Mining stocks were the big losers. The City was depressed by the overnight news that Chinese exports shrank by 10% year-on-year in September. Shares are also falling on Wall Street, where traders are also wondering whether the Federal Reserve should really raise interest rates soon. Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says: Wall Street has joined in the general flight from risk this afternoon, with the overnight Chinese export data still the chief culprit (although in fairness Bob Dylan being awarded a Nobel Prize would probably make anyone lose their faith in the future). There not much support for Unilever in the English town where Marmite is produced. Nazia Parveen, our North of England correspondent, has paid a flying visit to Burton upon Trent. And she found that many people believe Unilever is pushing its luck by trying to hike prices by 10%. One resident, 70-year old Dennis, is even planning to boycott Unilever (echoing Tory MP David Davies earlier today). \u201cEverything about Marmite is local - the workers, the ingredients - so ultimately I do not understand their argument and it is just downright profiteering. We do like our Marmite as a family, especially our daughter, but we\u2019re now going to boycott their products as we\u2019ve had enough of Unilever holding local businesses and their own workers to ransom.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: This photo shows some of the scores of produces which Unilever supplies to UK retailers. Many of them (unlike Marmite) will be produced abroad or rely on imported raw materials, thus vulnerable to the weaker pound. Sky News\u2019s Faisal Islam reckons Marmite lovers shouldn\u2019t panic: Steve Dresser, retail analyst at Grocery Insight, expects retailers to hike prices in January - once the Christmas season is behind them. He says: \u201cNo one wants to put prices up ahead of Christmas. Others may just wait until January.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s only going to get more painful.\u201d Dresser also reckons Tesco is winning the PR battle so far, rather than being accused of bullying suppliers. Media monitoring group Newton Insight report that the Tesco-Unilever spat has created particular interest in London, Scotland and Manchester (three places that voted to stay in the EU...). And more men than women are opining.... This is the defence for Unilever trying to hike the cost of Marmite, even through it\u2019s made in Britain rather than imported. Clive Lewis MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, is also concerned that UK shoppers are going to be hit in the pocket: \u201cOnce again the public are paying the price for Tory failure to make any contingency plans for Brexit. This is unlikely to stop at a Marmite shortage \u2013 more and more retailers are going to be squeezed by higher import prices in the coming months, as hedging contracts end and the cheaper pound starts to squeeze margins.\u201d Politics professor Philip Cowley has trawled through some recent polling data, and found that Liberal Democrat voters will be particularly hurt by the Tesco-Unilever standoff. But a jump in poultry prices could cause Theresa May\u2019s party some grief: Labour MP Stephen Kinnock says the Marmite price wars show that Brexiteers\u2019 optimism about leaving the EU was ill-founded. \u201cWhen the plunging pound stops you from getting PG Tips and Marmite in the supermarket, you\u2019re truly starting to feel the first tremors of Brexit. \u201cDavid Davis\u2019s claims that there were no downsides to Brexit are colliding with economic reality. The best thing the Government can do for economic confidence and the pound is to commit now to starting the upcoming negotiations on the basis of securing full and unrestricted access to the single market.\u201d One clarification: Tesco has insisted that Unilever products are still available in stores today, but not from its website. The Press Association has been out and about, snapping Unilever products on Tesco shelves: Reality is starting to bite about the practical impact of leaving the EU, writes our columnist Polly Toynbee. Unilever says all its prices must rise by 10% \u2013 which is still less than the 15% fall in the pound, so expect worse to come. The Unilever spat with Tesco over who pays is just a sideshow, as other retailers warn of steep price rises, as we import so many essentials. BT\u2019s chairman says imported phones and broadband hubs are already up 10%. Each day the Financial Times reports more banks declaring they are moving significant functions abroad, while car manufacturers look to invest elsewhere in the EU for their new models. As prices rise, the great majority of the population, whose incomes have been stagnant for nearly a decade, will see their living standards fall.... Here\u2019s her full take: We could get an explosion of rows between retailers and suppliers over price hikes early next year, reckons Markus Kuger of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the credit and risk firm. He says UK firms are on \u201chigh alert\u201d, and need to assess the impact of the weaker poudn on their customers and supplier now. Companies, and particularly retailers, will be keen to reach the end of the year with little or no price increase. What happens in the new year is yet to be seen: Article 50 is likely to be invoked, and consumers will likely begin to feel the impact of the falling value of the pound. Money transfer firm AFEX has cut its forecast for the pound, as the push towards Brexit continues. Analyst Trevor Charsley reckons sterling will lose another 5% over the next five months, even if a legal challenge launched today succeeds. \u201cSterling is going to remain under severe pressure in the near term as it continues to act as the release valve for market sentiment over the Brexit process. At the moment, the UK government is facing a legal challenge over parliamentary approval for Brexit. If the government loses in the high court, there will be pandemonium and the possible start of a constitutional crisis while if it wins, the \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit course will be pursued and we\u2019ve already seen what the market thinks of that. Either way it\u2019s a lose-lose for sterling. We think that we could see Sterling reach $1.15 against the Dollar by the end of Q1 2017.\u201d Prime minister Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has confirmed that the government aren\u2019t taking sides between Tesco and Unilever. \u201cIt is a decision for companies how they market and sell their products ... It is a commercial decision.\u201d Conservative backbench MP David Davies* has launched a one-man Marmite boycott. * - Not to be confused with David Davis, the Brexit secretary, whose views on yeast-based spreads are unknown Wise words from the Bishop of Burnley: Here\u2019s our latest piece on the atrocities taking place in Syria\u2019s second-largest city: Ground down by savagery \u2013 the agony of Aleppo Professor Andrew Fearne, of the University of East Anglia\u2019s Norwich Business School also expects more Brexit price rows. The price dispute between Tesco and Unilever is the first of many stand-offs that are inevitable as the implications of Brexit kick in and companies try to navigate a sustainable way forward. The problem is that some companies will use the exchange rate as a vehicle for negotiating price rises that are a) avoidable and b) could leave some of their customers un-competitive, if they agree to pay more when others refuse. The government isn\u2019t keen to be dragged into the Tesco-Unilever Brexit price battle: However, Lidlington may smell a Marmite-scented rat: High street chain WH Smith has revealed that it is also facing a hit from the slide in sterling. The company took out a hedge against a stronger dollar, but it runs out next year, meaning imported stationery  will cost more. CEO Stephen Clarke says Smiths is hoping to negotiate better prices from suppliers, and squeeze costs where possible. \u201cSince June 24, we have been talking to our suppliers and factories, looking at how we can reduce cost that might come through by consolidation of factories or through other productivity initiatives.\u201d The government responds.... The Marmite crisis has spread to the House of Commons, with shadow leader of the House Valerie Vaz raising the issue: The Breaking View\u2019s team at Reuters reckon that Tesco has the upper hand in the Brexit price war. The maker of Dove soap wants supermarkets like Tesco to pay more for its goods as the pound weakens. They can\u2019t easily pass that cost on to shoppers. Grocers have two reasons to play tough: Unilever\u2019s 15% operating margin, and their access to the consumer. There\u2019s a serious risk that more suppliers and retailers will clash over price rises in the months ahead. That\u2019s because the financial safety measures that some companies took, to insulate themselves from a sterling crash, would typically only last a few months. Roy Williams, managing director of supply chain firm, Vendigital, explains: \u201cMore disputes over prices are likely in the coming months, as many of the currency hedges that suppliers put in place to protect them from exchange rate changes, start to run out. Ultimately, the effect of these cost increases will be felt by consumers.\u201d Williams also has some sympathy for Unilever: \u201cAnyone that thinks Unilever is just trying it on, are wrong. The cost pressures facing many UK suppliers are very real at the moment. Deep falls in the value of the pound since the EU referendum are cutting deeply. \u201cHowever, Unilever may not have thought its position through carefully enough. Pursuing across-the-board price increases from customers is a blunt attempt to offset rising costs and this kind of approach would not stand up to detailed cost analysis by Tesco. A handy list of what\u2019s at stake: Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne reckons Tesco would typically hold one to two-week\u2019s worth of stock. So it might avoid serious shortages in stores, if it can kiss and make up with Unilever quickly. Monteyne adds: \u201cWhile politicians can deny reality, a shampoo produced on the continent is now 17 percent more expensive. This isn\u2019t about Tesco or Unilever but about all UK retailers and suppliers.\u201d The pound has dipped by 0.25% against the euro this morning, to \u20ac1.106. That means sterling has shed more than 15% against the single currency since June\u2019s referendum (when one pound bought you \u20ac1.30). That has a serious knock-on effect on a company, such as Unilever, which reports its financial results in euros. Is your local Tesco out of Marmite? What about Persil, Surf, Dove, Comfort, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream, Elmlea, Colman\u2019s, Helmann\u2019s, Knorr, Bertolli, Flora, Comfort and Pot Noodle? Guardian Witness want to know if the row between Tesco and Unilever is causing problems in the aisles. Has there been a run on marmite and other staples in your local supermarket? Share your photos of empty shelves with us - we\u2019ll post a selection of them in the blog. Today\u2019s selloff is pushing the pound close to the levels hit on Tuesday evening, when sterling suffered quite a wobble. It\u2019s currently trading at $1.216, down 17% since June\u2019s referendum. Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth has warned Unilever not to try to profiteer from the slump in sterling. He said the firms\u2019s reputation would be damaged \u201cif they seek to use the fall in the pound to exploit the consumer\u201d. (that\u2019s via the Press Association) The sight of Pot Noodles, PG Tips teabags and Knoor stock cubes vanishing from Tesco\u2019s shelves could be the moment when the pound\u2019s vicious tumble hits home to the public. Currency expert Kit Juckes, of French bank Societe Generale, says: Yesterday, the implications of the pound\u2019s fall on prices and retailer margins hit home for the wider public as the country\u2019s leading supermarket engaged in a war over prices with its highest-profile supplier of branded goods. Either UK consumers will eat store-branded yeast extract, or they\u2019ll pay more for Marmite, or the impact of the pound\u2019s fall will be shared between supplier and retailer. And other Marmite substitutes are available: The Daily Mail has responded to the commercial tensions between Tesco and Unilever with typical restraint: Over in the City, a wave of selling has dragged the FTSE 100 index back below the 7,000 mark. Mining stocks are leading the rout, following disappointing trade data from China. Chinese exports fell by 10% in September, which implies its economy is slowing faster than hoped -- which translates to less demand for raw materials. Tesco and Unilever are also pulling the London stock market down, as the Marmite price war alarms investors. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the City isn\u2019t impressed by the \u201csquabbling\u201d between Tesco and Unilever over price rises. That\u2019s why both company\u2019s shares are dropping this morning: Tesco may simply be trying to call Unilever\u2019s bluff over price hikes but markets are not impressed. Unilever market share is an issue as Tesco is by far Britain\u2019s leading retailer, although just how long can people go without Marmite and PG Tips is unclear. Tesco sales could suffer if consumers head to competitors for their favourite brands. Unilever dropped 2% on the open despite posting better than expected sales \u2013 a sign that shareholders are worrying about broader market conditions that chief executive Paul Polman said were \u2018weak and volatile\u2019. Tesco was down 2.5% at the start of play. Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons were also lower, reflecting nerves about cost pressures at the big retailers as the slump in sterling hits home. A weaker pound can only mean higher prices for consumers or lower margins for suppliers and retailers, or a combination of all of these. Shares in Unilever and Tesco have both fallen this morning. Tesco has dropped by 2.5%, as traders ponder the financial implications of losing a swath of popular brands from its shelves. Unilever are also in the red, down 2%, despite beating analyst forecasts this morning. Underlying sales increased of 3.2% in the last quarter, although unfavourable currency movements did hurt sales growth. Unilever\u2019s finance chief has defended the company\u2019s attempt to hike prices following the decline in sterling. Graeme Pitkethly told Reuters that it\u2019s just a normal part of business: \u201cThis is just devaluation-led cost increase, this is just quite normal,\u201d Labour MP Wes Streeting tweets: The price row between Tesco and Unilever is an important moment in the Brexit story, analysts say. The sight of Unilever\u2019s products vanishing from the shelves of Britain\u2019s largest retailer is \u201canother tangible sign of the power of the weak pound\u201d in a global economy, argues Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She writes: Some corners of the press are up in arms about how consumers are being held to ransom by a prominent remain campaigning corporate, however, this is what globalization is: an EU company owns quintessentially British goods such as Marmite. Overall, this stand off is not good for anyone, least of all Unilever, who could see reputational damage here in the UK, they are also likely to lose market share if its goods are not stocked in Tesco, and we would expect an agreement to be reached by both sides. Tesco is likely to stick to its guns, however, and play hardball with Unilever; only last week its CEO announced a new round of price reductions as part of the turnaround plan for the retail giant. The row is also a warning sign to consumers that prices are going to be pushed up, Brooks adds: The Tesco/ Unilever battle is the latest fallout from Brexit, and since the pound dipped further overnight, back below 1.22 after a hawkish tone in the minutes from the Fed\u2019s September meting, price wars are likely to heat up. The supermarkets are likely to try and resist price increases since most of them are trying to cut prices to attract consumers. However, this episode highlights how quickly weakness in the pound can effect us all in the pocket. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group agrees that consumers are going to face higher prices in the shops: Britain, a nation of Marmite stockpilers? Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s no escape from the financial implications of Brexit today. The pound has started the day on the back foot, dropping by half a cent to $1.216. That means sterling is close to its all-time lows, on a \u2018trade-weighted basis\u2019, as global markets assess Britain\u2019s likely fate out of the EU. Yesterday, Brexit secretary David Davis sent the pound dipping by hinting that Britain could well exit the single market, even though this would have serious implications for exporters and the financial services business. But that warning was eclipsed by the news that Tesco and Unilever were coming to (metaphorical) blows in a pricing row apparently triggered by the slump in sterling. Products including like Marmite, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream, , PG Tips tea, Knorr, Bertolli and Pot Noodles are hit, after Tesco refused to accept Unilever\u2019s demand for a price rise. They\u2019ve also vanished from the Tesco website, as news of the row hits the front pages: It\u2019s not quite clear why Marmite should be particularly sensitive to sterling\u2019s troubles \u2013 this nectar of the gods is carefully crafted in the Midlands, from leftover piles of brewer\u2019s yeast. One source told us: \u201cUnilever is using Brexit as an excuse to raise prices, even on products that are made in the UK.\u201d But there\u2019s no doubt that raw materials imported into the UK, by Unilever or anyone else, will cost more today. The pound has shed around 17% against the US dollar since June, which is an unpleasant pill for companies to swallow  . Unilever are actually reporting their financial results today, so we should hear more from them about the issue shortly....",

      "bodyText": "MPs are to vote on whether Sir Philip Green should lose his knighthood after the collapse of BHS, it has emerged. The vote on whether the retail tycoon should be stripped of his honour is expected to take place next week. An amendment to a debate which will discuss a highly critical report by the work and pensions committee will call for Green\u2019s title to be taken away. It is believed to be the first time that MPs have ever debated a motion on whether to annul an honour. MPs hope that if the amendment is carried, it will be acted upon by the honours forfeiture committee, which is chaired by the head of the civil service. The failure of BHS put 11,000 people out of work, and also left behind a pension scheme with a \u00a3570m shortfall. Green has said he is in talks about how to close that gap, but has faced criticism for his stewardship of the company and for his failure to sort out the troubled scheme. The parliamentary motion, first reported by BBC2\u2019s Newsnight, \u201ccalls on the honours forfeiture committee to cancel and annul [Green\u2019s knighthood]\u201d. The motion has been put forward by Conservative MP Richard Fuller and independent MP Michelle Thomson. Fuller said on Thursday: \u201cThe idea that Green should continue to use a knighthood for services to retailing is just wrong \u2026 This is about expressing a legitimate sentiment about the way someone has behaved. \u201cWe hope that other MPs will add their names to this amendment and that it will be acted upon.\u201d The vote comes less than two months after the final BHS store closed its doors. Green, whose retail empire includes Topshop, Topman, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, was granted an honour in June 2006. He has come under relentless scrutiny since selling BHS for \u00a31 to a little-known entrepreneur, Dominic Chappell, in March 2015. Chappell had barely any experience of working in retail and had been declared bankrupt at least twice. Over the following year, BHS declined and collapsed, with the department store chain going into administration a year after its sale. The prospect of Green losing his knighthood was first raised in June by Sir Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee. At the time, Green said it was an attempt to destroy his reputation. Green has a fortune estimated at more than \u00a33bn. During his ownership of BHS, he was paid more than \u00a3400m in dividends. Green told the Guardian on Thursday night that he did not wish to comment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get involved,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "It was one of the shortest wars in history, over within 24 hours. Peace has been declared between Unilever and Tesco, which will mean that Marmite is going back on the shelves of Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket. Short-lived it might have been, but the battle between the two corporate giants reveals a basic truth: the fall in the value of the pound will lead to higher prices in the shops. Competition between supermarkets may blunt the impact, but depreciation equals inflation and there is no getting round this. Living standards are going to be squeezed. What\u2019s more, further drops in the value of the pound are quite possible. Britain has a 6% current account deficit, the Bank of England is thinking about cutting interest rates, while the US Federal Reserve is poised to push up borrowing costs and the financial markets have finally woken up to the fact that the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, on as yet unspecified terms, is going to happen within the next few years. The message to any foreign exchange dealer is clear: sell, sell, sell. But it is not all one-way traffic. A declining currency will help, in three ways, to rectify the imbalances in the economy that have led to the highest balance of payments deficit in peacetime history. First, it will make the UK\u2019s manufactured goods more competitive in overseas markets. This is particularly true of those areas of hi-tech industry where the final value of the product relies more on brain power than imported raw materials. For import-intensive sectors, the benefits will be smaller. Second, it will be an added bonus for exporters of services, ranging from banking and insurance to architecture and the creative industries. Britain is the second biggest services exporter in the world and in recent years, the trade deficit in manufactured goods has been partly offset by a large surplus in \u201cinvisibles\u201d, currently running at about \u00a37bn a month. These services are now 20% cheaper in dollar terms than they were before the EU referendum on 23 June, which is a bonus, because the US takes more UK exports than those of any other country. Finally, there is tourism. The falling pound makes travel abroad more expensive, but what is bad news for the Canary Islands is good news for Cornwall. Those who find the Tuscan hills a bit pricey at the current exchange rate might be tempted to try the Trossachs instead. But it is not just a staycation effect: the UK has become a magnet for foreign tourists, whose dollars, euros, yuan and yen go a lot further. Designer brands, now much cheaper for foreign tourists, are flying off the shelves in central London. On balance, the falling pound will lead to stronger growth, higher prices and a smaller balance of payments deficit. Devaluation won\u2019t be pain free. It never is. But in a country with a floating currency, it is the way rebalancing happens.",

      "bodyText": "The owner of one of the UK\u2019s biggest restaurant groups has criticised the government\u2019s hardline immigration stance as \u201cretrograde\u201d and \u201cbonkers\u201d. David Loewi, co-owner of the group behind high-end London restaurants Le Pont de la Tour, Coq D\u2019Argent and Quaglino\u2019s, who is also chairman of the Restaurant Association trade body, said erecting barriers to the employment of workers from Europe would be \u201cextremely detrimental and would stop the growth of businesses\u201d. In an interview with the Guardian, Loewi said the Restaurant Association would be \u201clobbying hard\u201d against any block on employing talent from the EU and the government only had to look at the fall in the value of the pound in recent months to see how confidence in Britain was being affected by its stance. About 60% of workers at the London restaurants of Loewi\u2019s group, D&amp;D London, come from overseas, a similar proportion to other restaurant businesses in the capital. UK-wide, a fifth of workers in the accommodation and food services industries come from overseas. The majority of those workers come from the EU. Loewi said the anti-immigration stance taken by the government, combined with news reports of an increase in racist and xenophobic behaviour, had already made employing staff from abroad more difficult. \u201cThere are so many UK industries that would not be able to work without EU employees. We welcome English workers but we shouldn\u2019t be looking at where people come from if they can do a wonderful job. [Overseas workers] make London what it is and are important, certainly in the restaurant and hotel trades and the NHS,\u201d Loewi said. His comments come as the government faces growing criticism over its immigration stance since the Conservative conference when the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said it was considering requiring companies to declare the proportion of international staff in their workforce. Rudd later backtracked on the proposal, saying it was \u201cnot something we\u2019re definitely going to do\u201d. At the Tory conference she also announced a crackdown on overseas students and work visas, and pledged to prevent migrants \u201ctaking jobs British people could do\u201d. Loewi said Rudd\u2019s comments were \u201ccompletely bonkers, very negative and upsetting for a lot of fellow Europeans and people from all over the world who work in London and the rest of the UK. People will twice about coming here, paying their taxes. \u201cThe restaurant business in London pays very well and conditions are good. It\u2019s an exciting and fantastic career because you can move up and start your own business. But we can only grow and open more restaurants if we can find the staff. [Rudd\u2019s suggestions] are a retrograde and negative step.\u201d D&amp;D recently revealed a 3% rise in sales to \u00a3107.8m and 16% rise in underlying profits to \u00a313m. Last year it ditched plans for a London listing and saw its slowest sales growth in years as diners reined in their spending ahead of and immediately after the Brexit vote. Des Gunewardena, Loewi\u2019s fellow co-owner of D&amp;D, said the government needed to be \u201carmed very clearly with the positive impact of people coming from the EU on industries like ours and the NHS so they can negotiate rationally\u201d. He believes it is unlikely the government will ultimately block the hiring of skilled workers from the EU, although D&amp;D is already working to train more Britons to work in its kitchens and dining rooms. June, the month of the the EU referendum, was \u201crubbish\u201d but individuals had swiftly returned to dining out two weeks after the vote, he said. \u201cFor two weeks afterwards it was doom and gloom. But then the financial markets didn\u2019t collapse and everyone said: \u2018We\u2019re not going to lose our jobs tomorrow. We\u2019ve had the vote and going to Brexit, but we don\u2019t know what the shape of that is going to be for the next few years and so I\u2019m going back out to lunch and dinner.\u2019 Since then the business has been trading strongly. \u201cIndividual consumers are very positive. Going out to eat in a restaurant is a short-term decision not based on how things will be financially in three years\u2019 time. They are spending money and I think that\u2019s going to continue.\u201d D&amp;D, the vast majority of whose 34 restaurants are in London, is planning to power into the north of the UK with hopes of opening in Leeds, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Birmingham. The company opened its first UK restaurants outside the capital \u2013 Angelica and Crafthouse \u2013 in the Trinity shopping centre in Leeds in 2013. Gunewardena said the Leeds sites had been much more successful than expected and two more restaurants would be opening in the city later this year in the Victoria Gate development. The group\u2019s first site in Manchester opens next year and it is seeking sites in other major UK cities. \u201cIn London there is lots of demand but lots of restaurants. There is not as much demand in Leeds or Manchester or Edinburgh but there aren\u2019t as many restaurants,\u201d Gunewardena said.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of British properties suspected of belonging to corrupt politicians, tax evaders and criminals could be seized by enforcement agencies under tough new laws designed to tackle London\u2019s reputation as a haven for dirty money. Huge amounts of corrupt wealth is laundered through the capital\u2019s banks. The National Crime Agency believes up to \u00a3100bn of tainted cash could be passing through the UK each year. Much of it ends up in real estate, and in other assets such as luxury cars, art and jewellery. The criminal finances bill, published on Thursday, is designed to close a loophole which has left the authorities powerless to seize property from overseas criminals unless the individuals are first convicted in their country of origin. It will introduce the concept of \u201cunexplained wealth orders\u201d. The Serious Fraud Office, HM Revenue and Customs and other agencies will be able to apply to the high court for an order forcing the owner of an asset to explain how they obtained the funds to purchase it. The orders will apply to property and other assets worth more than \u00a3100,000. If the owner fails to demonstrate that a home or piece of jewellery was acquired using legal sources of income, agencies will be able to seize it. The law targets not just criminals, but politicians and public officials, known as \u201cpolitically exposed persons\u201d. Depending on how quickly it passes through parliament, the bill could come into force as early as spring 2017. \u201cThere are some hundreds of properties in the UK strongly suspected to have been acquired with the proceeds of corruption,\u201d said the campaign group Transparency International, which has been pressing for the new measures. \u201cThis will provide low-hanging fruit for immediate action by law enforcement agencies, if those agencies are properly resourced.\u201d The Guardian revealed through the Panama Papers how a powerful member of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s inner circle had built a multimillion-pound portfolio of boutique hotels in Scotland and luxury homes in Mayfair, Marylebone and Hampstead in London. Ali Dabaiba, who was head of Libya\u2019s infrastructure fund for a decade, has been accused by government prosecutors in Tripoli of plundering money meant for hospitals, schools and archaeology. He rejects the allegations. Scottish police have confirmed they are investigating, but Libya\u2019s request for an asset freeze has not been implemented. Bukola Saraki, the president of the Nigerian senate who faces allegations that he failed to declare his assets, owns a property in Belgravia in his own name. The Panama Papers revealed that the \u00a35.7m property next door belonged to Seychelles and BVI companies benefiting Saraki\u2019s wife and former special assistant. Saraki said he had declared all his assets correctly and in accordance with Nigerian legislation. During the London anti-corruption summit in May, the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, was asked if he demanded an apology from David Cameron for a gaffe in which the prime minister was filmed describing the west African country as \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d. Buhari replied that he wanted action: \u201cWhat I am demanding is the return of the assets\u201d. Unexplained wealth orders will also help expose the owners of properties. Land Registry figures show UK real estate worth more than \u00a3170bn is held by more than 30,000 tax haven companies. Most owners of these companies hide behind anonymous trusts, or nominee directors and shareholders. In a single 50-storey apartment complex in London, the Tower at St George Wharf in Vauxhall, a quarter of the flats are held through offshore companies. Those targeted will not need to be resident in the UK. So long as their assets are in the UK, an order can be enforced. The law will apply to property acquired before it is introduced. The bill also contains stronger seizure and forfeiture powers designed to make it easier for police and investigators to freeze bank accounts and confiscate assets such as jewellery and art, which are harder to seize under current laws. \u201cWe will not stand by and watch criminals use the UK to launder their dirty money or fund terrorism,\u201d said the security minister, Ben Wallace. \u201cThis legislation will ensure the UK is taking a world-leading role in cracking down on corruption and send a clear message to criminals \u2013 we will take your liberty and your money.\u201d Campaigners say that for the new law to be effective, agencies must be given the financial and political support to take powerful and wealthy individuals to court. \u201cWe simply cannot continue to roll out the red carpet to the world\u2019s corrupt elite wanting to lodge their illicit wealth in the UK,\u201d said the director of Transparency International, Robert Barrington. \u201cThe UK has a responsibility to ensure that any stolen wealth flowing into the country is stopped, frozen, and ultimately returned to the people from whom it was stolen.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Lord Wolfson warns against isolationist Brexit course", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next and prominent leave campaigner, has warned the British economy will be \u201cfinished\u201d if the government pursues an isolationist Brexit course. The Conservative peer told the Press Association the referendum vote was about UK independence, not isolation, adding that Britain would set itself up for economic failure if it closed itself off from the rest of the world. \u201cI think the hard, soft Brexit language is unhelpful, and what we should be talking about is whether we have an \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018closed\u2019 Brexit,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a press conference on Thursday. \u201cBritain voted for independence, it didn\u2019t vote for isolation and so we have a choice: are we going to choose to build an open, global-facing economy, or one that\u2019s closed and isolated? If we choose the latter, then our economy is finished. If we choose the former, we stand a chance of flourishing greatly.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s government has indicated it will embark on a so-called hard Brexit by introducing migration curbs and stopping the free movement of EU citizens into Britain. EU leaders have stressed that free movement is a condition for accessing the single market. Lord Wolfson made the comments shortly after announcing that the \u00a3250,000 Wolfson economics prize would be awarded to the best solution for funding and overhauling the UK\u2019s road network. Against a backdrop of deep cuts to transport budgets at national and local levels, the prize seeks ideas to bring more investment \u201cand a better deal for road users\u201d. Wolfson, sponsor of the prize, said he wanted entries to embrace the latest digital technologies, new forms of power for cars and lorries and self-driving vehicles. He said Brexit was an opportunity to break from old ways of thinking that prevented new roads being built and existing ones being upgraded. \u201cOne of the things that becomes very clear when you look at the challenges our economy will face as we go into Brexit is that we need new ideas to stimulate growth in the UK,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cStructural reform of our roads is one such idea that could generate an enormous amount of economic growth, which could compensate for some of the inevitable economic shock as we exit the EU.\u201d Rejecting concerns that the emphasis would be just on cars and lorries, he said public transport must also be integrated into any plans along with the needs of cyclists. He said the judges expected universities and policymakers from the UK, US, China and across Europe to come up with ideas that answer the question: \u201cHow can we pay for better, safer, more reliable roads in a way that is fair to road users and good for the economy and the environment?\u201d Sir John Kingman, the chairman of Legal &amp; General and the chair of the judging panel, said the Treasury was under pressure to halt a decline in income from road users while at the same time bolster spending on the roads. He said the Treasury received \u00a333bn from road users in fuel tax and excise duties and \u201cwould be very interested in ideas in this area\u201d to stop the decline. Wolfson warned that Britain\u2019s roads were in desperate need of investment, which was not so much about a new motorway or upgrade, but thousands of smaller initiatives to bring the network into the 21st century. Kingman, who was a senior official at the Treasury before joining L&amp;G, said Britain\u2019s record of investment was weak in recent years, partly due to protests from special interest groups. \u201cWe have a problem because we are a crowded island, but we shouldn\u2019t be defeatist about this. We have cracked many problems in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are particularly interested in how new technologies can address these issues and convince the public that it is possible. This is not a prize just for innovative ideas but ones that are workable and can be sold to the public.\u201d The contest is free to enter and open to anyone. It is sponsored by the Charles Wolfson Charitable Trust and managed by Policy Exchange, the free market thinktank. The deadline for submissions is Thursday 2 March 2017. A shortlist will be announced in April and the prize will be awarded at a ceremony in July. Judges include Alistair Darling, a former chancellor of the exchequer, Isabel Dedring, a former London deputy mayor for transport, and Bridget Rosewell, a former chief economist to the Greater London Authority and founder of the Volterra Partners consultancy.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "MPs are being urged to back a parliamentary motion expressing \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the potential fire risk posed by white goods such as tumble dryers, dishwashers and fridges, and highlighting the inadequacies of the product recall scheme. An early day motion was tabled on Thursday by Labour MP Andy Slaughter in the next phase of a campaign to raise safety standards, after a series of fires across the UK allegedly caused by faulty tumble dryers. It is calling for a government-backed single register for UK product recalls, readily accessible to consumers online. Last week an independent report by the London Fire Brigade confirmed that a faulty Indesit tumble dryer was the cause of a blaze in Slaughter\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Bush constituency, which ripped through part of an 18-storey tower block in west London and took 120 firefighters to control. After the report \u2013 and as part of the London fire brigade\u2019s Total Recalls campaign, which aims to make white goods safer \u2013 fire chiefs renewed their call for the dryer\u2019s parent company, Whirlpool, to change its advice to consumers. They also warned of the lack of a robust national system of product recalls in emergency situations. The early day motion tabled by Slaughter on \u201cwhite goods fires and product recalls\u201d notes that the London fire brigade \u201chas attended over 2,000 incidents since 2011 to tackle fires involving white goods, with an estimated cost to the public purse of over \u00a3118m\u201d and with \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences for those involved. Last November Whirlpool admitted that a fire fault exists in some models, caused when excess fluff touches the heating element. However, it did not issue a recall, insisting that people could continue to use the affected dryers while they waited for them to be \u201cmodified\u201d provided they were not left unattended. Nearly a year later, Whirlpool is still replacing or repairing more than 5m potentially faulty machines across the UK, under the brand names Indesit, Hotpoint, Creda and Proline. But the programme has triggered criticism, with some consumers being told they must wait for more than a year for an engineer to visit. The motion also states that a London coroner\u2019s recommended changes to improve the product recall system following an earlier, fatal fire in 2010 involving a machine from a different manufacturer \u201chave not yet been made\u201d. The coroner urged reform of safety standards after a father died having saved his children from a fire caused by a faulty fridge-freezer manufactured by Beko. The motion urges the government to agree to introduce a single register for UK product recalls \u2013 as called for by the London Fire Brigade \u2013 and which also has the support of consumer group Which?, Electrical Safety First, the Chief Fire Officers\u2019 Association and the Local Government Association. The consumer minister, Margot James, said last week she was ordering Whirlpool to do more to reassure its customers and the wider public about the risks of potentially dangerous tumble dryers. She is also creating a working group on product recalls and safety \u201cto look at what more can be done to improve the safety of white goods, including tumble dryers\u201d. Slaughter will lead a delegation of MPs to meet James on Thursday. He is also seeking a further debate in the Commons on this issue and the wider problems with the product recall system in the UK. Whirlpool declined to comment on the early day motion. Alex Neill, managing director of home and legal services at the consumer group Which?, said: \u201cThe Whirlpool case highlights that the product safety system is not working for consumers. Pressure is now mounting on the government to review this case and the entire system, as it is clearly failing consumers.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Sky shareholder calls for James Murdoch to be replaced as chairman", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Sky shareholder has called for James Murdoch to be replaced as chairman, arguing that his appointment breached the corporate governance code and is a major conflict of interest because he is the chief executive of its biggest shareholder, 21st Century Fox. Royal London Asset Management, which owns \u00a352m in Sky shares, said shareholders needed an independent chairman and criticised the process by which Murdoch was appointed earlier this year. Murdoch, a non-executive director at Sky, was the only candidate put forward by its nominations committee to take over from the then chairman, Nick Ferguson. Murdoch had been forced to stand down as chairman of Sky in 2012 after the phone-hacking scandal at News International, publisher of the Sun, Times, Sunday Times and now defunct News of the World, where he had been chairman. Piers Hillier, the chief investment officer at Royal London, said: \u201cWe continue to believe that James Murdoch\u2019s reappointment as chairman of Sky is inappropriate.\u201d Hillier was speaking as Sky held its annual general meeting (pdf) at the company\u2019s Osterley campus in west London on Thursday. \u201cShould Fox make a bid for Sky, investors need a strong, independent chairman to protect the interests of minority shareholders and negotiate the best possible deal,\u201d he said. Murdoch, speaking to the Guardian after the annual meeting, dismissed concerns about the conflict of interest of his role. \u201cWell I\u2019m not qualified as independent because I\u2019m not an independent director, being associated with the major shareholder,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw there were no questions from shareholders here. So It\u2019s not for me to comment on.\u201d Murdoch was appointed by a three-member committee of Sky directors, including the Aberdeen Asset Management chief executive, Martin Gilbert, now the Sky deputy chairman, and the independent director Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, who will stand down from the board after Thursday\u2019s shareholder meeting. Murdoch was then unanimously voted in as chairman by his 11 fellow board members, six of whom are independent directors. \u201cNo attempts were made to advertise the position externally, or appoint an agency, which goes against the UK corporate governance code,\u201d Hillier said. Last week, shareholder advisory firm Pirc said investors should vote to oppose Murdoch\u2019s reappointment as chairman citing similar issues, such as a lack of independence and concerns about appointment process not being an \u201cobjective\u201d one. Pirc also recommended a vote against non-executive directors Chase Carey and John Nallen, both of whom are senior executives at 21st Century Fox, which has a 39.6% stake in Sky. Broadcasting regulator Ofcom heavily criticised Murdoch\u2019s conduct in handling the phone-hacking scandal, saying it \u201crepeatedly fell short\u201d of what was expected of a chairman. The culture select committee also weighed in, concluding that Murdoch had showed \u201cwilful ignorance\u201d of phone hacking. News International, which was rebranded News UK in 2013, is part of News Corp, the newspaper company founded by Murdoch\u2019s father, Rupert. The Fox TV, film and entertainment business was spun out of News Corp as a separately listed company in 2013. The Murdoch family was forced to give up on an \u00a38bn-plus News Corp bid to take full control of Sky in 2011 as the fallout from the phone hacking scandal made it too politically difficult to complete. Asked at the AGM about a potential renewed bid by Fox, Murdoch said that the meeting was not the forum to talk about \u201chypothetical scenarios\u201d but added that Sky had \u201crobust processes and procedures in place to deal with any related party transactions\u201d. He handed the investor query to Andrew Sukawaty, the non-executive chairman of Inmarsat, who was appointed senior independent director when Murdoch was made chairman. \u201cIn terms of the hypothetical transaction you refer to well the company been through that before,\u201d Sukawaty said. \u201cThe independent directors on the board have demonstrated how they can be independent in that particular situation. In addition to all that we have shored ourselves up so to speak. Not only that we have a senior independent director and deputy chairman in Martin Gilbert. \u201cTogether we will stand up and make sure any process that is required to make sure any transaction that is dealt with is dealt with properly. Belt and braces. We [would] take extraordinary measures to deal with that.\u201d The UK corporate governance code is not legally binding and companies only have to \u201ccomply or explain\u201d. Sky decided against informing or consulting shareholders about the appointment of Murdoch, although there is no legal corporate governance requirement to do so. In the four years since he moved into a non-executive directorship, investors have never voted against his reappointment at an annual general meeting.",

      "body": "<p>A Sky shareholder has called for James Murdoch to be replaced as chairman, arguing that his appointment breached the corporate governance code and is a major conflict of interest because he is the chief executive of its biggest shareholder, 21st Century Fox.</p> <p>Royal London Asset Management, which owns \u00a352m in Sky shares, said shareholders needed an independent chairman and criticised the process by which Murdoch was appointed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/29/james-murdoch-sky-chairman-rupert-murdoch\">earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>Murdoch, a non-executive director at Sky, was the only candidate put forward by its nominations committee to take over from the then chairman, Nick Ferguson.</p> <p>Murdoch had been forced to stand down as chairman of Sky in 2012 after the phone-hacking scandal at News International, publisher of the Sun, Times, Sunday Times and now defunct News of the World, where he had been chairman.</p> <p>Piers Hillier, the chief investment officer at Royal London, said: \u201cWe continue to believe that James Murdoch\u2019s reappointment as chairman of Sky is inappropriate.\u201d Hillier was speaking as Sky held its <a href=\"https://corporate.sky.com/documents/investors/annual-general-meeting/notice_of_meeting_2016.pdf\">annual general meeting (pdf)</a> at the company\u2019s Osterley campus in west London on Thursday. \u201cShould Fox make a bid for Sky, investors need a strong, independent chairman to protect the interests of minority shareholders and negotiate the best possible deal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Murdoch, speaking to the Guardian after the annual meeting, dismissed concerns about the conflict of interest of his role. \u201cWell I\u2019m not qualified as independent because I\u2019m not an independent director, being associated with the major shareholder,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw there were no questions from shareholders here. So It\u2019s not for me to comment on.\u201d</p> <p>Murdoch was appointed by a three-member committee of Sky directors, including the Aberdeen Asset Management chief executive, Martin Gilbert, now the Sky deputy chairman, and the independent director Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, who will stand down from the board after Thursday\u2019s shareholder meeting.</p> <p>Murdoch was then unanimously voted in as chairman by his 11 fellow board members, six of whom are independent directors. \u201cNo attempts were made to advertise the position externally, or appoint an agency, which goes against the UK corporate governance code,\u201d Hillier said.</p> <p>Last week, shareholder advisory firm Pirc said investors should vote to oppose Murdoch\u2019s reappointment as chairman citing similar issues, such as a lack of independence and concerns about appointment process not being an \u201cobjective\u201d one.</p> <p>Pirc also recommended a vote against non-executive directors Chase Carey and John Nallen, both of whom are senior executives at 21st Century Fox, which has a 39.6% stake in Sky.</p> <p>Broadcasting regulator Ofcom heavily criticised Murdoch\u2019s conduct in handling the phone-hacking scandal, saying it \u201crepeatedly fell short\u201d of what was expected of a chairman.</p> <p>The culture select committee also weighed in, concluding that Murdoch had showed \u201cwilful ignorance\u201d of phone hacking.</p> <p>News International, which was rebranded News UK in 2013, is part of News Corp, the newspaper company founded by Murdoch\u2019s father, Rupert. The Fox TV, film and entertainment business was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/28/news-corp-split-rupert-murdoch\">spun out of News Corp</a> as a separately listed company in 2013.</p> <p>The Murdoch family was forced to give up on an \u00a38bn-plus News Corp bid to take full control of Sky in 2011 as the fallout from the phone hacking scandal made it too politically difficult to complete.</p> <p>Asked at the AGM about a potential renewed bid by Fox, Murdoch said that the meeting was not the forum to talk about \u201chypothetical scenarios\u201d but added that Sky had \u201crobust processes and procedures in place to deal with any related party transactions\u201d.</p> <p>He handed the investor query to Andrew Sukawaty, the non-executive chairman of Inmarsat, who was appointed senior independent director when Murdoch was made chairman.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of the hypothetical transaction you refer to well the company been through that before,\u201d Sukawaty said. \u201cThe independent directors on the board have demonstrated how they can be independent in that particular situation. In addition to all that we have shored ourselves up so to speak. Not only that we have a senior independent director and deputy chairman in Martin Gilbert. </p> <p>\u201cTogether we will stand up and make sure any process that is required to make sure any transaction that is dealt with is dealt with properly. Belt and braces. We [would] take extraordinary measures to deal with that.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Codes-Standards/Corporate-governance/UK-Corporate-Governance-Code.aspx\">UK corporate governance code</a> is not legally binding and companies only have to \u201ccomply or explain\u201d.</p> <p>Sky decided against informing or consulting shareholders about the appointment of Murdoch, although there is no legal corporate governance requirement to do so.</p> <p>In the four years since he moved into a non-executive directorship, investors have never voted against his reappointment at an annual general meeting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer has defended the company in its row with Tesco over price rises for household brands ranging from Marmite to Persil, describing the increases as \u201cnormal\u201d. Tesco is running low on stock of a number of Unilever products \u2013 including Marmite, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream and Lynx body spray \u2013 after the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company halted deliveries as a result of the dispute. Unilever is one of Britain\u2019s biggest suppliers of branded food and household goods and claims its products are found in 98% of UK households. Its brands also include Comfort, Dove, Hellmann\u2019s, Magnum, Persil, Vaseline and PG Tips. The company is trying to charge Tesco an extra 10% for its goods, blaming the pound\u2019s fall against the euro and the dollar since the Brexit vote on 23 June. The row will be embarrassing for the supermarket\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who was previously Unilever\u2019s UK and Ireland chairman. Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer, insisted on Thursday morning that price increases to offset rising costs were a normal part of doing business. \u201cWe are taking price increases in the UK. That is a normal devaluation-led cycle,\u201d he said. He said he was confident the dispute would be \u201cresolved pretty quickly\u201d. The UK accounts for less than 5% of Unilever\u2019s business, Pitkethly said, as the company announced better than expected quarterly results after pushing through price increases around the world. The company posted underlying sales growth of 3.2% for the past three months, ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. UK consumers, however, have been told to brace themselves for price rises. Pinar Hosafci, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor International, said: \u201cBrexit has been a trigger that started this and it is likely that other companies, which are reporting in euros, including the likes of Nestl\u00e9 and Ferrero, will follow suit. This move could be more detrimental to Tesco than Unilever, which owns a number of power brands that are either leading or at best ranking in the second place.\u201d The British Retail Consortium said shops would be doing their best to hold down prices for customers, but that the impact of the falling pound would eventually work its way through to shelf prices. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cRetailers are firmly on the side of consumers in negotiating with suppliers and improving efficiencies in the supply chain to control the inflationary pressure that is building through the devaluation of the pound. \u201cHowever, years of falling shop prices and higher costs have left limited scope for retailers to continue absorbing this pressure, and everyone in the supply chain will need to play their part in maintaining low prices for consumers.\u201d The big supermarkets are likely to fight particularly hard to prevent price rises as they are all battling to stop consumers taking their trade to discounters Aldi and Lidl, which sell more own-brand goods. Downing Street refused to comment on how retailers and suppliers should respond to the fall in sterling. A spokesman for Theresa May said: \u201cIt is a decision for companies how they market and sell their products \u2026 It is a commercial decision.\u201d Nick Lee, professor of marketing at Warwick Business School, said both Unilever and Tesco were gambling on their customers being loyal: \u201cThey need each other but are jockeying for best position in a new uncertain environment. I expect we\u2019ll see a lot of this in the coming months as players in this space look to renegotiate deals, and try to play on public sympathy to pressure their negotiation partners.\u201d Roy Williams, the managing director of the supply chain consultants Vendigital, also said the Tesco row would be the first of many: \u201cMore disputes over prices are likely in the coming months, as many of the currency hedges that suppliers put in place to protect them from exchange-rate changes start to run out. Ultimately, the effect of these cost increases will be felt by consumers.\u201d Shares in Unilever and Tesco opened lower on Thursday, with Unilever down by 2% and Tesco falling by 2.5%. Neil Wilson, a market analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cAgainst the backdrop of its spat with Tesco, the statement \u2026 highlights how cost pressures are creeping into UK retail, potentially knocking dividends and share prices for a number of well-known stocks.\u201d Unilever has also tried to charge other retailers more, including Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons. Speaking on Wednesday night, a source said: \u201cUnilever is using Brexit as an excuse to raise prices, even on products that are made in the UK.\u201d Marmite is produced in the UK in Burton-on-Trent, but Unilever pointed out that commodities are priced in dollars, affecting the cost of products even if they are made in Britain. The company reports in euros. Tesco said: \u201cWe are currently experiencing availability issues on a number of Unilever products. We hope to have this issue resolved soon.\u201d A spokesman said the supermarket was offering Unilever products as usual in stores, even though they had vanished from its website. Meanwhile, Marmite fans appeared unfazed by the dispute, posting pictures of bare-looking Tesco shelves on social media and, in one case, putting a used jar of Marmite up for sale on eBay for \u00a3100,000. Eamon O\u2019Hearn, the GMB union\u2019s national officer for the food industry, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very common for suppliers and retailers to renegotiate supply contracts but super-rich companies like Unilever must not be allowed to exploit the government\u2019s chaotic handling of Brexit as an excuse for making workers and shoppers pay the price.\u201d Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cTesco may choose to stand its ground on pricing, but history suggests that if other retailers can stomach the increase, consumers will be willing to stump up to get their Unilever fix.\u201d He noted that Unilever had raised prices by 15.5% in Latin America after a currency devaluation. Despite the increase, consumers largely kept buying its products, with sales volumes down 5%.",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s billionaires saw their wealth shrink by an average of \u00a3215m each last year, as economic headwinds made themselves felt. A report published on Thursday by UBS and PricewaterhouseCoopers has found that falling commodity prices helped put billionaires under pressure at a time of stalling growth in technology and finance, the motors of wealth creation. The study\u2019s authors found that Asia is creating a new billionaire every three days, but the US billionaire population only grew by five in 2015. Europe\u2019s wealthiest individuals were proving the most resilient, the report said. In 2015, the global billionaire population effectively increased by 50 to 1,397, according to the study, but the total wealth of these individuals fell by $300bn (\u00a3246bn) from $5.4tn to $5.1tn, an average loss of \u00a3215m per person. The study said 210 people became members of the billionaires\u2019 club in 2015, more than half of whom were in Asia, where young entrepreneurs are rapidly becoming wealthy in sectors such as real estate, technology and retail. At the same time, 160 people lost their billionaire status, including those who died. One-third of the billionaires covered by the study are aged over 70.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is running short of stocks of a range of household brands from Marmite to Comfort fabric conditioner after a row with its major supplier Unilever. It is understood that Unilever has halted deliveries to Tesco after a dispute over price, and several famous brands are currently unavailable from the supermarket chain\u2019s website. The food, toiletries and household goods supplier has been attempting to raise prices across a wide range of goods by about 10%, blaming the falling value of the pound against the euro and the dollar. The row will be embarrassing for the supermarket\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, who previously held a senior role at Unilever. It also comes after Tesco made sweeping changes to the way its buyers deal with suppliers after strong criticism from the industry watchdog, the Grocery Code Adjudicator. A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe are experiencing availability issues on a number of Unilever products. We always work to ensure customers get the best possible prices and we hope to have this issue resolved soon.\u201d Unilever is one of the UK\u2019s biggest suppliers of branded foods and household goods and the dispute could have serious consequences for both sides. In different areas of the country a number of Unilever brands have sold out. They include Persil, Surf, Dove, Comfort, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream, Elmlea, Colman\u2019s, Helmann\u2019s, Marmite, Knorr, Bertolli, Flora, Comfort and Pot Noodle. It is understood that Unilever has approached a number of the major retailers in an attempt to increase prices. One well-informed source said: \u201cUnilever is using Brexit as an excuse to raise prices, even on products that are made in the UK.\u201d Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said Unilever\u2019s attempt to increase prices was not surprising and reflected attempts by a large number of supermarket suppliers to offset cost increases. He suggested there were likely to be more disputes between retailers and suppliers. \u201cA lot of suppliers are seeking to pass on price increases to retailers but in the current environment retailers are increasingly reluctant to take it. They want to keep prices as low as they can to increase their affordability against the competition.\u201d It emerged earlier this week that confidence in the food and drink industry is increasingly fragile since the upheaval caused by the EU referendum result. Ged Futter, a retail consultant at IR Solutions, which advises suppliers on how to negotiate with retailers, said the fall in the value of the pound was having a huge impact on those importing goods. \u201cA lot of suppliers have seen costs go up significantly because of currency. Some are covered until the end of the year but not beyond. Retailers are saying they can\u2019t pass cost increases on to their shoppers but that has to happen, or they are not going to have any suppliers left,\u201d he said. Details of the standoff between Tesco and Unilever emerged just a few hours after Justin King, a former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, warned that supermarkets could not absorb cost increases caused by the falling pound and that price rises were inevitable. Serious disputes over price are not that unusual in the grocery sector. Roberts said it was usually the retailer who ended up backing down because shoppers demanded certain brands. In 2011, Tesco refused to stock a number of Premier Foods\u2019 brands, including Oxo and Ambrosia, after the supplier tried to pass on a 14% increase in costs. The two fell out the previous year over Hovis when Premier, citing soaring wheat prices, tried to raise the price of its loaves. Unilever declined to comment on the dispute with Tesco.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct\u2019s acting finance director has left the company nearly a week after it issued a profit warning. The troubled retailer announced that Matt Pearson had resigned to take up a role with a different employer. He will stay at Sports Direct until the end of December. His departure comes a few weeks after the chief executive, Dave Forsey, stepped down unexpectedly, prompting Sports Direct\u2019s billionaire founder, Mike Ashley, to take the reins. The company has appointed Herbert Monteith, a member of the finance team, as interim head of finance, a non-board position. He will work closely with Karen Byers, who was recently promoted to global head of operations, and Sean Nevitt, the global head of commercial. Ashley said: \u201cMatt has been a valued member of the Sports Direct family for more than nine years and he will be a loss to the company. I wish him all the best for the future and would like to thank him for his time at Sports Direct.\u201d At the end of last week, Sports Direct said the \u201cflash crash\u201d of sterling had caused the company to lose \u00a315m in the currency markets. On Thursday, it said trading remained in line with that announcement. The retailer has faced stern criticism over its treatment of workers and issued a series of earnings downgrades, which were blamed on tough trading conditions. Pearson was promoted to acting CFO in June 2015 after the position had been left vacant for 18 months. Some City investors had expressed concern that Sports Direct was operating without a permanent finance chief.",
