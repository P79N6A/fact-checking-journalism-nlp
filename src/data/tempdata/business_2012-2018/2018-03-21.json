      "bodyText": "And finally.... Wall Street has closed sightly in the red after Jay Powell\u2019s debut press conference. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 45 points lower at 24,682, a dip of nearly 0.2%. The tech-focused Nasdaq lost 0.5%, although Facebook stemmed its recent sharp losses by gaining 0.75%. Traders in New York got a clear message from Powell - the process of raising US interest rate further away from their crisis-era record lows will continue, Jeremy Gatto, Investment Manager on Unigestion\u2019s multi asset Navigator fund, explains: \u201cToday\u2019s FOMC meeting confirms the scenario we have been advocating for some time, that \u2018monetary policy normalisation\u2019 is well and truly underway. As expected Powell committed to raise rates, indicating strong global economic growth, while highlighting that the Federal Reserve is seeking a \u2018middle ground\u2019 agenda. And that\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW and NF Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says Jerome Powell avoided any shocks today. Indeed, the new Fed chair maintained the same cautious approach as his predecessor, Janet Yellen: \u201cJay Powell\u2019s first Fed presser went more or less as expected, with the FOMC raising rates and making some vague hawkish noises about the future while maintaining its cautious approach to policy tightening. \u201cAs with his testimony to lawmakers, the Fed Chair stuck to the \u201cPowell Doctrine\u201d of studiously avoiding commenting on political issues. If the Fed will react to trade or fiscal policy, it will do so only once it is looking directly at the economic effects of those policies. \u201cPowell noted that there is a range of opinion on the committee on the outlook, meaning as always that the Fed\u2019s projections should not be taken as gospel. But today\u2019s FOMC median projections did include a mild inflation overshoot in 2019 and 2020, yet this did not prompt a policy response, further underlining the fact that Yellen\u2019s cautious approach to policy is alive and well.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Luke Kawa has summed up Jerome Powell\u2019s approach rather well: That\u2019s it! Jerome Powell has wrapped up his first press conference as Fed chair after 45 minutes, around 15 minutes quicker than expected. He rattled through the questions swiftly, giving sharp and clear answers - without any diversions into deep economic theory. I was stuck by Powell\u2019s warning that the new tariffs on steel and aluminium are worrying businesses leaders in America. The Fed must be a little anxious that a trade war will break out, even though Powell declined to talk about relations between Washington and Beijing. Powell sounded confident about the US economy, and also tried to persuade reporters not to get too excited by the Fed\u2019s famous dot charts. They\u2019re only predictions of future rate hikes, not an oracle, after all. He hinted that he might change policy and hold a press conference after every Fed meeting -- so we might be seeing a lot more of Mr Powell in future. Here\u2019s some more reaction: Powell sways elegantly to avoid a potential curveball on political issues. He says he\u2019s not kept awake at night, worrying whether he\u2019s free to raise rates ahead of the midterm elections this autumn. On wages, Powell says he\u2019s surprised that wages haven\u2019t risen faster, given the pace of the economic recovery. Q: What impact would a US-China trade war have on the global economy? Powell replies that trade wars are a \u201clow profile risk\u201d that has become \u201ca more prominent risk to the outlook\u201d. However he won\u2019t comment on trade policy between countries. Powell says the Fed expects Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts will have a \u201cmeaningful\u201d impact on the economy, although its full effect isn\u2019t clear. Ooooh. Asked about financial risks, Jerome Powell warns that the prices of some assets are \u2018elevated\u2019, including shares. Q: What impact might the US government\u2019s tariffs have on American monetary policy? Fed chair Jerome Powell says that a number of FOMC committee members brought up the issue of tariffs at this week\u2019s meeting. We don\u2019t think that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook, he explains. However, \u201ca number of participants\u201d reported that they had met with business leaders; trade policy has become a concern going forward with that group, Powell warns. Pressed on this point, Powell says there is a risk that the economic outlook could suffer if there was \u201cmore widespread retaliation\u201d and actions back-and-forth between countries. Today\u2019s meeting comes less than two weeks after Donald Trump signed the order to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum. Q: Would you like to hold more Fed press conferences? Powell says he is considering whether to hold a press conference after every FOMC meeting (the committee meets eight times a year, but only hold a press conference four times). But he\u2019s concerned that people might think he\u2019s signalling a change to monetary policy (because investors don\u2019t expect any big news at meetings without a press conference). Asked about the neutral rate of interest, Powell says he and his colleagues believe is is still \u201cquite low\u201d Jerome Powell suggests we shouldn\u2019t get too fixated on the dot-plot forecasts of where each Fed policymaker believe interest rates will be in future. We only had one decision today, and that was to raise the Funds rate, he says. No-one voted on what the \u2018mean\u2019 projection should be. Here\u2019s a clip of Powell\u2019s opening statement: Q: How concerned would you be if US inflation rose over your 2% target? Powell says the Fed would be concerned about \u201csustained deviation\u201d above or below its target. We\u2019re swiftly onto questions. Q: The Fed has raised its growth forecasts, and sees unemployment lower than before, but hasn\u2019t changed its forecast for inflation much. Why? Jerome Powell says the US unemployment rate has fallen from 10% during the crisis to just 4.1% today, but with only very gradual pressure on inflation. That suggests the relationship between changes in labor market slack and inflation isn\u2019t very tight. So the Fed is trying to take the middle ground, by making gradual changes to the Federal Funds rate. The new Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, has arrived for his first press conference since succeeding Janet Yellen. He confirms that the Federal Open Market Committee voted to raise US interest rates today. He calls it another another step in the process of gradually scaling back accommodative monetary policy. Powell says the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months, and that the FOMC expects the jobs market to remain strong. On the outlook, he says the Fed will be watching how the economy performs in the months and years ahead. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says today\u2019s rate hike was a \u201cfairly straightforward decision\u201d: The US economy seems to be in somewhat of a sweet spot, with a synchronised global economy, a weaker dollar, fiscal expansion and the prospect of increased business investment all supportive of growth. Wholesale tax reform should filter through more strongly into the economic data ahead, providing increased growth momentum. At the same time, inflation is showing signs of getting close to the Fed\u2019s goal, and spare capacity in the labour market is declining. Michael Pearce of Capital Economics says the Federal Reserve is signalling that rates will rise faster than expected in the next 21 months. The Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates by 25bp today was widely expected but some investors may have been caught off-guard by the degree to which Fed officials increased their projections for future interest rate hikes. The median projection for the fed funds rate at the end of 2019 is now 2.75-3.00% - exactly in line with our own forecast, which until recently was at the hawkish end of the spectrum. Today\u2019s decision to raise the federal funds rate to 1.50% \u2013 1.75% was unanimous; the two dissenters at the December meeting, Charles Evans and Neel Kashkari, are not voting FOMC members this year and their replacements are more hawkish. Aaron Anderson, Senior Vice President of Research, Fisher Investments, comments: The Fed\u2019s more hawkish tone could simply be a result of new Chairman Powell\u2019s communication style compared to Janet Yellen, or it could mean the Fed believes recent economic data signal a strengthening economy, tighter labor market, and higher inflation. But if a few data points since the last meeting were enough to change the Fed\u2019s plans, they could change just as easily in the future.\u201d Here\u2019s Nell Henderson of the Wall Street Journal on those dots... Shares are pushing higher on Wall Street, as traders react to the Fed announcement. The Dow is now up 180 points, or 0.75%, having been around 135 points higher earlier. That shows there is relief that the rate-setting committee isn\u2019t predicting four rate hikes in 2018. Here\u2019s the latest \u2018dot plot\u2019 from the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymakers, showing where they expect interest rates to be at the end of 2018. Today\u2019s guesstimates are in the right-hand column, next to the ones from December\u2019s meeting. As you can see, the majority expect rates to have risen to 2.25% - ie, two more hikes on top of today\u2019s one. But, there has been an upward movement among the dots, compared to three months ago, suggesting the Fed is a little more hawkish. Looking further ahead, policymakers now expect another 3 hikes in 2019 (up from two in December) plus two in 2020: The Fed has also signalled its confidence in the strength of the US economy. In a statement announcing the rate hike, it says: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. It has then added a new line, declaring: The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. Looking further ahead, the Fed is more hawkish about how fast US interest rates will rise: The Fed is sticking with its forecast that it will raise interest rates three times in 2018 (including today\u2019s hike, of course!). NEWSFLASH: The Federal Reserve has raised US interest rates. The Fed\u2019s Open Market committee has voted to hike the target for the Federal Funds rate, to 1.5% to 1.75% - up from 1.25% to 1.5%. More to follow.... A quick check at the markets - the Dow is up 0.5%, or 134 points, at 24,861 as Wall Street braces for the Federal Reserve announcement.... The US dollar is down around 0.5% against the pound, at $1.407. The Fed decision is imminent... Tension is mounting, with less than 20 minutes to go until the Federal Reserve decision hits the wires. Most traders expect the Fed to hike borrowing costs today - so the real interest is in how many further hikes are expected. Miles Eakers, Chief Market Analyst at Centtrip, explains: \u201cThe Federal Open Market Committee are widely expected to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later today. Last December, the median forecast for the funds rate by year end was 2.1% which implied three hikes. But since then, hawkish rhetoric from the Fed has swayed market expectation towards four rate hikes in 2018. Any confirmation of this will create volatility. As investors await the Federal Reserve decision, European markets have ended on a mixed note. With Wall Street now in positive territory, most have come back from their worst levels, but uncertainty over the Fed\u2019s future interest rate policy meant caution was the watchword. Meanwhile the problems with UK retailers put the FTSE 100 under added pressure. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 22.3 points or 0.32% at 7038.97 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.01% to 12,309.15 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.24% at 5239.74 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.1% to 22,820.12 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.52% lower at 9630.9 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.68% to 800.10 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered from its early falls and is now up 88 points or 0.36%. The dollar has dipped ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting, despite the prospect of a rate rise announcement. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: In a move that surprised no-one the Dow Jones was incredibly reticent to do much after the bell rang on Wall Street, as investors eye the month\u2019s Fed meeting. The Dow dipped 0.1% this Wednesday; enough of a drop to suggest some pre-Fed fretting, but nothing to really tip its hand as to what it\u2019s are expecting from the March statement. The dollar was more interesting in that regard. The greenback fell half a percent against the pound, 0.4% against the euro and 0.2% the yen, hinting that investors are perhaps a tad worried that Jerome Powell, in his first outing as the central bank\u2019s chief, won\u2019t be as hawkish as they want. Interestingly the questions surrounding the meeting are less about what the Fed will do, but more about how they do it. At this point a rate rise seems almost guaranteed, a move that would take the benchmark interest rate to 1.75%. What is less certain are how many interest rate increases will follow throughout 2018, namely whether Powell will pull the trigger a further 2 or 3 times after his debut hike. More signs of strength in the US economy ahead of the Federal Reserve rate decision. Home sales jumped 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 units, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts has expected a rise of just 0.5%. But there is a shortage of available homes which is pushing up prices and helping to price first time buyers out of the market. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said sales were uneven across the country but did increase nicely overall: A big jump in existing sales in the South and West last month helped the housing market recover from a two-month sales slump,. The very healthy US economy and labor market are creating a sizeable interest in buying a home in early 2018. However, even as seasonal inventory gains helped boost sales last month, home prices \u2013 especially in the West \u2013 shot up considerably. Affordability continues to be a pressing issue because new and existing housing supply is still severely subpar. Meanwhile Facebook shares are down another 2.5% at the open, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. Here is our latest story: Ahead of the Federal Reserve decision - with rates expected to rise and investors seeking hints about further increases this year - Wall Street has slipped back at the open. With technology stocks still under pressure, both from EU tax plans and the fallout from the Facebook controversy, the Nasdaq Composite has opened down 0.21%. The S&amp;P 500 has dipped 0.09% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 27 points or 0.12%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Markets are pricing in a roughly 90% chance of a hike this week, the first of three or four anticipated this year. So the focus is on the dot plot and the accompanying language from chair Jay Powell. For risk, markets will want the Fed to hold off indicating 4 hikes in 2018 but keep up its confident assessment of the economy. This will in large part depend on how policymakers assess inflationary pressures \u2013 if they think inflation is coming they might accelerate the path of rate hikes. But there is a much bigger risk that the Fed sticks to three in 2018 but raises forecasts for 2019 and that could knock equities and give a boost to USD more than indicating four hikes in 2018 might... Since the last meeting in December inflation has picked up but the pace has not really accelerated beyond the most bullish scenarios seen already... Currently the median dot plot suggests three hikes this year, and there is a chance that this could rise to four. However, it is perhaps more likely that the dots show greater confidence in three hikes (i.e., the doves come round to consensus), than the centrists join the hawks and go for four. Nevertheless, with the key doves not voting this year (Neel Kashkari and Charles Evans), it would imply that the actual FOMC dots of voting members is higher... Trade and tariffs will also be a big focus having weighed not insignificantly in the last week. It may be the wrong moment for the Fed to signal more hawkish policy when we look at the potential negative impact of tariffs on GDP. We wait to see whether policymakers comment on the impact of tariffs and a trade war on the economy. The jump in UK wage growth means interest rates may rise soon, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He writes: Higher interest rates from the Bank of England have moved a decisive step closer after the latest official figures showed earnings growing at their fastest rate in more than two years. The latest snapshot of the labour market from the Office for National Statisticsshowed that a record high level of employment and a drift from part-time to full-time work pushed up wages in the three months ending in January. With inflation falling, the ONS said the squeeze on living standards that had dampened consumer spending over the past year had come to an end if bonuses were included in the yardstick used to calculate earnings. Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee is meeting to discuss interest rates this week and the prospect of an increase in borrowing costs pushed up the pound on foreign exchanges. An increase in May is thought more likely than one this week.... More here: Over in parliament, the prime minister has hailed today\u2019s jobs figures. Theresa May points out that employment is at a joint record high, the unemployment rate hasn\u2019t been lower since 1975, and economic inactivity is at a record low. No mention of the fact that the jobless total did rise in the last quarter, though... Dr Carole Easton, chief executive of Young Women\u2019s Trust, is concerned that younger female workers aren\u2019t getting enough help to join the jobs market. She points out that unemployment among women aged 16-24 rose by 21,000 in the three months to January. That means 151,000 young women are now unemployed and a further 340,000 young women are economically inactive and not in full-time education. Dr Easton says young people need help to get the right skills, and should also benefit from the National Living Wage (which only applies to those over-25s today). \u201c21,000 more young women are unemployed, meaning nearly half a million are out of work. The Government must help young women into jobs to benefit individuals, businesses and the economy. \u201cYoung women are telling us they want to work but they are getting shut out of the jobs market by employer discrimination, low pay and unaffordable childcare. Interestingly, the number of people in work and the number counted as unemployment in Britain both rose in the last quarter. You might expect them to move inversely - but instead, there was a fall in the number of \u2018economically inactive\u2019 citizens, suggesting people are being lured back into the jobs market. Dr Heather Rolfe of the NIESR thinktank explains: These figures indicate that, in the face of recruitment difficulties, including as a result of a large fall in net migration of EU citizens, employers are hiring people who have not been actively seeking work. This might be seen as a positive sign, but this pool is likely to be limited\u201d As usual, Britain\u2019s unemployment report has split Westminster - with the government pointing to what\u2019s going well, and the opposition focusing on the problems. The Department for Work and Pensions highlights that the employment rate is now back at a record high (75.3%), with the unemployment rate back at its lowest level since Harold Wilson was prime minister in 1975 (at 4.3%). Esther McVey, secretary of state for Work and Pensions, says the government is trying to get more people into work, adding: \u201cAnd from next month, we\u2019ll be taking thousands more people out of paying tax and also increasing the National Living Wage, benefiting those on the lowest pay and making sure they keep more of what they earn. \u201cIn fact by raising the National Living Wage we have ensured that the lowest earners have seen their wages grow by almost 7% above inflation since 2015.\u201d But her opposite number, Labour\u2019s Margaret Greenwood, is concerned that the number of people out of work rose by 24,000 during the last quarter. \u201cWith eight million people in working households living in poverty and the cost of basic essentials remaining high, the Spring Statement was a missed opportunity for the Government to take the urgent action needed. \u201cThe Government has also failed to close the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups, who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts.\u201d Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, has spotted another interesting angle in today\u2019s jobs report: More people are quitting their jobs to move to another company. That could drive wages growth higher, he reckons, as employers are forced to fight for labour. \u201cThe post-Brexit squeeze on consumer spending power is easing. Low unemployment, a slowing flow of overseas workers into the UK and high levels of job vacancies are raising wage pressures and boosting job moves. \u201cThe number of people resigning from one job to move to another fell in the wake of the financial crisis, but is now running at its highest level since 2001. \u201cThe scene is set for a pickup in earnings growth this year.\u201d The Resolution Foundation has crunched today\u2019s labour force statistics, and calculated that Britain\u2019s pay squeeze is finally ending. The think tank says that the official confirmation will come in a month\u2019s time, when the ONS publishes the unemployment figures for November-February. But today\u2019s data shows that earnings are finally overtaking inflation, after almost a year of pain for hard-pressed households. Resolution says: Today\u2019s figures show that real average weekly earnings fell by 0.2% in the three months to January, fell by 0.6% in the public sector, but were flat at 0 per cent in the private sector. However, the Resolution Foundation pay projection shows that earnings growth is set to have returned to 0.1% overall, and 0.2% in the private sector, in the three months to February. However, while private sector workers can celebrate, those in the public sector will continue to suffer falling real wages for a bit longer - until new pay deals are approved, Stephen Clarke, Resolution\u2019s senior economic analyst, warns that the squeeze on living standards isn\u2019t over. \u201cBritain\u2019s 12-month pay squeeze has finally ended, though public sector workers will have to wait until new pay settlements are agreed across the NHS, schools, the police and other parts of the public sector. \u201cWhile it\u2019s a relief that pay packets are no longer shrinking, the outlook for anemic pay growth remains a huge living standards concern. Average pay is still lower than it was a decade ago, and an entire generation of young workers are still yet to experience the 3-4 per cent pay rises that were once the norm.\u201d Factory workers and builders are enjoying decent pay rises, says Geraint Johnes, research director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School. He\u2019s hopeful that the fall in real wages will soon end, especially as the UK economy is still creating jobs.. \u201cEncouraging news on pay includes the 2.8% rise in total pay on the preferred measure, this being driven by gains in manufacturing and, particularly, construction. Alongside the drop in consumer price inflation announced yesterday, this heralds an early end to the squeeze on real earnings. Meanwhile, the 182k rise in full-time employees in employment figure signals a labour market that continues to grow.\u201d Despite the pick-up in wages in recent months, UK workers are still poorer than before the financial crisis once you adjust for inflation. The Office for National Statistics explains that in real terms: average regular pay (excluding bonuses) for employees in Great Britain was \u00a3459 per week before tax and other deductions from pay, \u00a314 lower than the pre-downturn peak of \u00a3473 per week recorded for March 2008 average total pay (including bonuses) for employees in Great Britain was \u00a3488 per week before tax and other deductions from pay, \u00a334 lower than the pre-downturn peak of \u00a3522 per week recorded for February 2008 The ONS also provided this chart, which shows the impact of austerity on the wages of teachers, doctors, police officers and other public sector workers Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen back to 4.3%, its lowest level since 1975. However, the number of people out of work has risen, by 24,000 to 1.45 million in the three months to January 2018 when compared with August to October 2017. In another boost, Britain\u2019s employment rate has risen to 75.3% in the three months to January. That\u2019s up from 74.6% a year ago, and the joint highest on record. There were 32.25 million people in work, 168,000 more than for August to October 2017 and 402,000 more than for a year earlier. Breaking: Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis is easing, as wages accelerate and close the gap with inflation. Basic pay rose by 2.6% per year in the three months to January, up from 2.5% in the three months to December 2017. If you include bonuses, then earnings jumped by 2.8% (again, up from 2.5% a month earlier). That\u2019s the biggest jump since September 2015, according to the latest labour force statistics which were just released. That means pay is catching up with inflation, which was 3% in January and only 2.7% in February. The Office for National Statistics estimates that real wages have actually stopped falling (if you\u2019re lucky enough to get a bonus, anyway). Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) fell by 0.2% excluding bonuses, but were unchanged including bonuses, compared with a year earlier. More to follow.... Hannah Uttley of the Daily Mail sums up the scene: Hundreds of jobs are also at risk at UK retailer New Look. New Look\u2019s creditors are meeting today to vote on a rescue deal to help its avoid administration. Under the plan, New Look would shut up to 60 of its worst-performing stores, putting around 980 staff at risk of redundancy. Mothercare, the mother and baby chain, has also come under fierce pressure in recent days. Shares in the company hit a record low yesterday, on fears that it is struggling to raise funds for a new turnaround programme. Three weeks ago, it warned it was in rescue talks with its banks, as it was on the brink of breaching its lending covenants Mothercare has now issued a statement to the City, saying that these talks are \u2018progressing constructively\u2019. It has also won a short-term reprieve from its lenders, who have agreed not to test these covenants next week. However, Mothercare now faces a two-month deadline to get new funding. The company says: \u201cMothercare expects those discussions to conclude before 17 May 2018, the scheduled date for the announcement of its preliminary results, and Mothercare\u2019s lenders have agreed to defer the testing of our financial covenants due on 24 March 2018 accordingly. We will make further announcements as and when appropriate. As previously indicated, we are also exploring additional sources of financing to support and maintain the momentum of our transformation programme and we are engaged in preliminary discussions on securing such additional financing. Shares have risen by 9% this morning, to 17p. Back in July 2017 they were worth almost \u00a33. We also have news from another struggling retailer, Carpetright. The floorings company has announced that it is exploring a company voluntary arrangement, which would allow it to shut some of its loss-making store and cut its rent bill. Carpetright has also secured a \u00a312.5 loan from one of its shareholders, Meditor. This will provide much-needed working capital while the company works through its problems. It is in talks with its banks to relax its covenants, and is also considering raising up to \u00a360m through a rights issue to shore up its balance sheet. Wilf Walsh, chief executive officer of Carpetright, took a sideswipe at previous management for creating a sprawling portfolio of stores. \u201cThe aggressive store opening strategy pursued by the Company\u2019s previous leadership has left Carpetright burdened with an oversized property estate consisting of too many poorly located stores on rents which are simply unsustainable. The Company has worked hard over recent years to address this legacy issue and reduce the size of its property estate, however many of these poor performing stores still have long leases to run, which has limited our ability to exit a meaningful number in the short-to-medium term. Moss Bros\u2019s CEO, Brian Brick, warns that 2018 will be a tough year for retailers: In common with many UK retailers, the year ahead looks like being a very challenging one and we have taken action early to be sure we protect the underlying strength of the business. We do believe continued investment is essential to ensure we retain a sustainable point of differentiation and that we leverage our distinct position on the high street.\u201d Moss Bros has hit shareholders with its second profits warning of the year. The formal clothing and suit hire business has warned that profits for the current financial year, to January 2019, will be \u201cmaterially lower than current market expectations\u201d. That\u2019s quite a shocker, given Moss Bros is only two months into this financial year. Moss Bros warned that it has suffered a \u201cmaterial\u201d shortage of stock -- partly blamed on Brexit -- and a fall in visitors to its stores. It says: Following the consolidation of the Group\u2019s supplier base in response to Sterling weakness, there have been material short-term issues with the resulting availability of stock. This stock shortfall across all categories has had a negative effect on sales in all retail channels and will continue to do so until late Spring. Hire sales continue to be challenging, although the peak trading period for Hire is still to come. As such the Group has remained prudent in its outlook. The reduction in store footfall that was experienced towards the latter part of December, has continued, reflecting a more cautious consumer environment. Shares in Moss Bros have slumped by 30% in early trading. DIY chain Kingfisher has sent a chill through Britain\u2019s retail sector by reporting a fall in earnings, and warning that the UK market is tough. Pre-tax profits at the company, which owns B&amp;Q and Screwfix in the UK, have slumped by 10% in the last year to \u00a3682m. Kingfisher warned that UK sales in the last quarter has been \u201csofter\u201d, with less demand for big ticket items. Sales in France, where Kingfisher owns Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t and Castorama in France, were \u201cweaker and volatile\u201d, it warns. The City is unimpressed; shares in Kingfisher have slumped by over 7% in early trading to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. V\u00e9ronique Laury, Chief Executive Officer, says Kingfisher benefitted from stronger sales in Poland. \u201cOur performance this year has been mixed, however, with solid growth at Screwfix and Poland, offset by continued weaker sales in France and some business disruption, principally reflecting product availability and clearance. We are acting on the causes of this disruption, however next year will be another big year in our transformation plan. The pace of change is quick and impactful but necessary as we build the new ONE Kingfisher engine to support our ambition to be the leading home improvement company, based on putting customer needs first. The outlook for our main markets is also mixed. The UK is more uncertain, France is encouraging yet volatile, whilst the market in Poland remains supportive. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two big events will keep traders on their toes today. First, we get the latest UK labour market figures for the three months to January. They may show that Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis is easing. Earnings are tipped to have risen by 2.6% per year, closing the gap with inflation (which fell to 2.7% in February). Economists also expect that the jobless rate will remain at 4.4%, having risen from 4.3% last month. A strong jobs report could strengthen the pound. Investors across the world will also be watching America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve. The Fed is widely expected to raise US interest rates at today\u2019s meeting, and will also release fresh economic forecasts and projections for future interest rate moves (its \u2018dot plot\u2019). The Fed\u2019s new chairman - Jerome Powell - will hold his first press conference, and there\u2019s huge interest in his views. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: Markets are almost certain that the Fed will be raising interest rates by 25 basis points later today, suggesting that a rate hike has been already priced in. Instead, the focus will be on the accompanying statement, economic forecast, the dot plot and the Q&amp;A session with Fed Chair, Jerome Powell. Economic forecasts are likely to be revised after President Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax bill into law last December. This should be reflected in the GDP growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, but the magnitude of change is a hard guess. Similarly, inflation and unemployment estimates are likely to see upgrades from December\u2019s projections. However, the key question remains - how does such a change impact monetary policy tightening in the next two years? The answer to this question will be mirrored in the dot plot chart, and it is here where most market participants are divided which makes trading the Fed a tricky one. The latest dot plot, released in December\u2019s meeting, shows three rate rises in 2018, followed by another two in 2019, and reaching a range of 3-3.35% by 2020. An upward shift in the dots, whether in the short or long term, will have implications for the markets, and especially for the dollar, which has been in a downtrend since late 2016.

This will in large part depend on how policymakers assess inflationary pressures \u2013 if they think inflation is coming they might accelerate the path of rate hikes. But there is a much bigger risk that the Fed sticks to three in 2018 but raises forecasts for 2019 and that could knock equities and give a boost to USD more than indicating four hikes in 2018 might...</p> <p>Since the last meeting in December inflation has picked up but the pace has not really accelerated beyond the most bullish scenarios seen already...</p> <p>Currently the median dot plot suggests three hikes this year, and there is a chance that this could rise to four. However, it is perhaps more likely that the dots show greater confidence in three hikes (i.e., the doves come round to consensus), than the centrists join the hawks and go for four. Nevertheless, with the key doves not voting this year (Neel Kashkari and Charles Evans), it would imply that the actual FOMC dots of voting members is higher...</p> <p>Trade and tariffs will also be a big focus having weighed not insignificantly in the last week. It may be the wrong moment for the Fed to signal more hawkish policy when we look at the potential negative impact of tariffs on GDP.

They may show that Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis is easing. Earnings are tipped to have risen by 2.6% per year, closing the gap with inflation (which fell to 2.7% in February).</p> <p>Economists also expect that the jobless rate will remain at 4.4%, having risen from 4.3% last month.</p> <p>A strong jobs report could strengthen the pound.</p> <p>Investors across the world will also be watching America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve.</p> <p>The Fed is widely expected to raise US interest rates at today\u2019s meeting, and will also release fresh economic forecasts and projections for future interest rate moves (its \u2018dot plot\u2019).</p> <p>The Fed\u2019s new chairman - Jerome Powell - will hold his first press conference, and there\u2019s huge interest in his views.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fb3cf21a89d98414597dd43c606b4e5fbe4aed0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fb3cf21a89d98414597dd43c606b4e5fbe4aed0/0_0_4771_3183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Hussein Sayed, </strong>chief market strategist at<strong> FXTM</strong>, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets are almost certain that the Fed will be raising interest rates by 25 basis points later today, suggesting that a rate hike has been already priced in.</p> <p>Instead, the focus will be on the accompanying statement, economic forecast, the dot plot and the Q&amp;A session with Fed Chair, Jerome Powell.</p> <p>Economic forecasts are likely to be revised after President Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax bill into law last December. This should be reflected in the GDP growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, but the magnitude of change is a hard guess. Similarly, inflation and unemployment estimates are likely to see upgrades from December\u2019s projections. However, the key question remains - how does such a change impact monetary policy tightening in the next two years? </p> <p>The answer to this question will be mirrored in the dot plot chart, and it is here where most market participants are divided which makes trading the Fed a tricky one. The latest dot plot, released in December\u2019s meeting, shows three rate rises in 2018, followed by another two in 2019, and reaching a range of 3-3.35% by 2020.</p> <p>An upward shift in the dots, whether in the short or long term, will have implications for the markets, and especially for the dollar, which has been in a downtrend since late 2016.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The agenda</h2> <ul> <li>9.30am GMT: UK unemployment and wage statistics for November-January<br></li> <li>9.30am GMT: UK public finances for February<br></li> <li>6pm GMT: US Federal Reserve interest rate decision<br></li> <li>6.30pm GMT: Press conference with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell<br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-03-21T08:37:53.279Z\">at 8.37am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

The quarter percentage point rise to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% was the sixth such increase since 2015 and comes as the Fed appears to be moving, slightly, more quickly to end an era of historically low interest rates that began during the last recession. The announcement came as the Fed chair, Jerome \u201cJay\u201d Powell, gave his first press conference in the role he took over from his predecessor Janet Yellen in February.

The rise, which was unanimously approved, comes after Congress passed two major bills that may spur the economy. In January Donald Trump signed off on a $1.5tn tax cut that reduces corporate and income tax rates. In February Congress agreed to a $300bn two-year increase in federal funding. The Trump administration has claimed the tax cuts will fuel US economic growth above 3% next year, significantly above the 2.5% growth it achieved last year, but Powell said the Fed did not expect growth above 3% in the near future. \u201cWe have been through many years of growth rate around 2%,\u201d said Powell. While there are elements in the tax cuts that could boost growth \u201cwe don\u2019t know how big those effects will be\u201d. Last year the Fed indicated it would raise rates three times in 2018 but some economists have speculated that the central bank may accelerate that programme given the fiscal stimulus from Trump\u2019s massive tax cuts and their potential to fuel inflation. Powell was asked if there were signs of \u201cbubbles\u201d in the economy and said that some asset classes, certain equities and commercial real estate, did seem higher than the \u201chistorical average\u201d. However, he said the Fed was monitoring the situation it was not overly concerned. \u201cIf you put all that into a pie, what you have here is moderate vulnerability in our view,\u201d he said.",

The company, in a stock exchange announcement, said it was holding meetings with investors to raise \u00a3125m via a share placing that would help it pay a \u00a330m tax bill due at the end of the month, fund overdue payments to creditors and repay a \u00a330m loan.

Shares in the company, which also owns the wholesaler Matthew Clark, were suspended at 101p last week after two profit warnings in the space of a week wiped more than 60% off its stock market value.

In its latest announcement on Wednesday, Conviviality admitted that profits for the year to 29 April would be about \u00a310m less than it had told the City only a week ago.

Previously the City had been expecting profits of \u00a370m.

The news pushed its shares up nearly 26% to 87.9p. The Cabinet Office insisted in January that the firm, which supplies a range of services to the government in areas spanning health, education and defence, was not in a similar position to the collapsed construction company Carillion. Outsourcing companies such as Interserve and Capita have been under heightened scrutiny since Carillion entered liquidation on 15 January with just \u00a329m cash in the bank, putting 43,000 jobs at risk. Interserve said it had agreed commercial terms in principle with its lenders which would give it total borrowing facilities of \u00a3834m. In December, it secured short-term financing of \u00a3180m and postponed the test date for its loan covenants for three months. This has now been extended to the end of April to ensure the necessary paperwork can be completed for the refinancing. The Reading-based company warned in October that it may breach covenants after worsening trading, and last month it was forced to deny reports that it was struggling to secure a refinancing deal after Carillion\u2019s collapse spooked its lenders. Interserve, which employs 80,000 people worldwide including 25,000 in the UK, issued profit warnings in September and October last year. It blamed its problems on a number of waste-to-energy contracts that deal with generating energy in the form of electricity and/or heat from the primary treatment of waste. It had net debts of about \u00a3513m at the end of 2017. However, since then trading has improved and the company said in an update on 10 January that it expected operating profit in 2018 to be better than City analysts were forecasting. Debbie White, its chief executive, said on Wednesday: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a significant milestone for Interserve and a major step in securing a firm financial platform to underpin the group\u2019s future. \u201cWe are encouraged by the support from our lenders in respect of these new facilities, which will allow the new management team to execute our business plan, focused on delivering a great service for customers, driving growth and restoring value.\u201d As part of the agreement, Interserve will issue warrants to its banks to buy shares at 10p a share. If exercised, this would give them a 20% stake in the company. The firm said it had agreed the refinancing deal with the trustee of its pension scheme. The proposals still need to be approved by all lenders. Emerald Investment, the largest lender, has been buying up loans from the banks and is backing the refinancing. It is the the family office of Scottish entrepreneur Alan McIntosh, co-founder of Punch Taverns and Cairn Homes. Emerald said: \u201cThe granting of these additional facilities illustrates the strength of Interserve\u2019s business and management team, and is a clear vote of confidence in the company\u2019s long-term strategy. Emerald Investment looks forward to working with Interserve\u2019s management team to support future growth in the business, to the benefit of all stakeholders.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest residential price data shows a continued slowing of growth which reflects the end of the housing boom. Whereas the prices of apartments and flats alone had been slowing, now the prices of established houses are following suit. In the December quarter last year, the average price of residential property grew just 1.0% \u2013 and while this was an improvement on the 0.2% fall in the preceding quarter, it is one of the weakest quarters of growth recorded in the past five years: The annual growth figures show the picture more clearly \u2013 in every capital city except for Perth annual growth in December was slower than it was in September. And the figures in Perth are not exactly heartening, given in December housing prices had fallen just 1.7% over the previous 12 months, compared with a fall of 2.4% in the 12 months to September: But there was no real shock in the figures \u2013 monthly housing finance figures have been pointing this way for some time. The latest figures out last week show that in January the level of housing finance was 1.5% below what it was 12 months earlier. That is the first annual fall since August 2016: Now as then the fall in housing finance is being driven by a decrease in investor finance but the difference is that, in August 2016, the Reserve Bank cut interest rates from 1.75% to 1.5%. But right now, there is absolutely no sense of any rate cut coming. The minutes of the most recent meeting of the Reserve Bank board noted that the fall in investor finance was mostly off the back of \u201cthe prudential measures introduced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority relating to interest-only lending\u201d. And while the board noted that there would likely be some further slowing of housing credit growth, there was little concern. With regards to housing prices, the RBA board noted that the slowing of growth was particularly pronounced in Sydney and Melbourne and that \u201cconditions in housing markets elsewhere had been relatively stable\u201d. The board also expressed some concerns about the level of debt held by households, and that was taken as a sign that they were not interested in cutting rates any further as this would inevitably increase debt. But this mixture of slowing housing price growth, worries about debt levels and the continuing weak household income and wages growth has seen markets become very much less sure about when the RBA will increase interest rates. At the end of January, perhaps flush with the optimism of a nice break over Christmas, the market was anticipating an increase in rates to 1.75% by November this year and a further increase to 2% by June next year. Now the market anticipates the rise to 1.75% will only occur by then: The continued weak growth of housing finance certainly does nothing to suggest that RBA will need to increase rates to put a check on house prices. As I have previously noted, there is a very solid link between annual housing finance growth now and house price growth in six months time. This would suggest that over the first half of this year housing price growth should continue to slow: The slowing of growth is occurring across the entire housing market \u2013 both for established houses and for \u201cattached dwellings\u201d (such as flats and apartments). But the slowing has been most pronounced for established houses. In September last year, the average price across all capital cities for such houses was 9.3% above where it was 12 months earlier; in December this had fallen to growth of just 5.6%: But of course average national figures give a very distorted picture, because Sydney and Melbourne account for a majority of all housing stock value. And the housing price boom since the RBA began its rate cuts in November 2011 has been very much Sydney and Melbourne based and very much for established houses rather than for apartments or flats: In Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth the growth in the prices of established houses has been more than double that of attached dwellings. Mostly \u2013 especially in Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra \u2013 this is due to a surge in the construction of such apartments. And while the price growth of established houses might be slowing, it remains very much too late for those hoping for some relief of affordability in Sydney and Melbourne. Since December 2011, established house prices in Sydney grew by 83%, whereas average full-time earnings in New South Wales over the same period grew just 17.5%. Similarly, this rise in prices of established houses in Melbourne has far outstripped that of earnings. But this is less evident in other capital cities and not so at all for attached dwellings \u2013 indeed in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Canberra full-time average earnings have increased by more than has the average price of attached dwellings: But with this comes a concern, given that generally house prices and apartments move in line. The big discrepancy in places such as Melbourne and Canberra does suggest a correction should occur: Over the past five years, while household incomes and wages have barely grown, the housing market has been the mainstay of strength in the Australian economy \u2013 especially in Sydney and Melbourne. But that strength was based on investors and progressively lower interest rates. With new rules limiting investors and interest rates seemingly having reached their bottom, that boom now looks to be over.",

      "bodyText": "The gloom on the high street deepened on Wednesday as struggling Carpetright said it was set to close stores, Moss Bros issued a stark profits warning, B&amp;Q reported falling sales, Mothercare said it remained in talks with its bankers and New Look\u2019s creditors voted to slim down the struggling fashion retailer. Carpetright, Britain\u2019s biggest carpet retailer, did not reveal how many outlets might shut, but it is believed to be considering axing up to a quarter of its 409 UK stores. A decision is expected in the next few weeks. It said the closures were needed to address the \u201clegacy property issue\u201d resulting from overexpansion under its previous management. The company is considering a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a process designed to stave off insolvency by closing stores and negotiating lower rents with landlords. It has arranged an emergency short-term loan of \u00a312.5m from shareholder Meditor in return for an additional 5% stake and also wants to raise between \u00a340m and \u00a360m through an equity issue. Carpetright has issued a series of profits warnings in recent months, sending its shares sharply lower. At their current level of 41p, the business is valued at less than \u00a330m. The potential Carpetright closures come as fashion retailer New Look\u2019s creditors met on Wednesday afternoon, with 98% voting for a CVA that will involve the closure of up to 60 of its 593 stores and rent reductions on dozens more. Landlords leaving the meeting expressed frustration at taking a financial hit and feared more retailers would follow the same route as New Look. Several said they were worried the CVA would not solve New Look\u2019s problems. The retailer has debts of \u00a31.2bn against sales of \u00a31.4bn last year. One said: \u201cThis is a chronically badly-run business. It\u2019s a difficult climate out there but to load up a retailer with this sort of debt is just crazy.\u201d Clothing suppliers at the meeting expressed relief that the chain would live on. One said: \u201cIt\u2019s a sensible CVA. New Look has continued to pay suppliers on time and that gives it the best chance of survival.\u201d There was grim news from another clothing retailer, Moss Bros, which warned that profits for the coming year were likely to be \u201cmaterially lower than current market expectations\u201d. The company\u2019s shares crashed 23% to 45p as it said the suit hire business was \u201cchallenging\u201d and that the number of shoppers on the high street remained lower than hoped, \u201creflecting a more cautious consumer environment\u201d. The company also admitted that sales were affected by stock shortages after Moss Bros made changes to the way it sourced clothing in an attempt to offset Brexit-driven inflation in costs. At B&amp;Q, which is owned by Kingfisher, sales dropped by 5.1% as the chief executive, V\u00e9ronique Laury, described the outlook for the UK as \u201cuncertain\u201d. Kingfisher\u2019s profits for the year to end January were down by 10% to \u00a3682m. The slowdown at Kingfisher comes despite troubles at its major competitor Homebase, where sales have slumped since a botched takeover by Australian group Bunnings. The group is considering closing as many as 40 stores putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Meanwhile, Mothercare, the struggling mother and baby retailer that is in talks with its banks, has been given more time to secure extra funding. Its lenders have deferred key tests of its financial covenants \u2013 which had been due on Saturday \u2013 until May. The retailer said talks on the terms of its existing loans were \u201cprogressing constructively\u201d and it hopes to reach agreement by mid-May when its results are due. \u201cRetail Black Wednesday: the sequel,\u201d said Patrick O\u2019Brien, the UK retail research director at market research firm GlobalData. \u201cJust three weeks after the administrations of Toys R Us and Maplin were announced on the same day dubbed \u2018Black Wednesday\u2019, it appears the sequel is already upon us, with Moss Bros, Carpetright, Mothercare and New Look all being in the news for the wrong reasons.\u201d Slowing consumer spending, rising costs and the switch to buying online have bitten down hard on retailers in the past six months, with businesses including electronics store Maplin, children\u2019s specialist Toys R Us, furniture retailer MultiYork and bedmaker Warren Evans calling in administrators and putting thousands of staff out of work. Expensive homeware such as sofas, kitchens and carpets have been hit particularly hard as the housing market has slowed. Department stores House of Fraser, Debenhams and Marks &amp; Spencer are either reducing the size of stores or closing them as they try to adapt to changing shopping habits. The recent cold weather also hit trade for many retailers, with sales at John Lewis down 14% that week, while Ocado warned on Tuesday that it took a \u00a31.5m profit hit from the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyd\u2019s of London slumped to a \u00a32bn loss last year, its first in six years, as the insurance market was hit by a series of major hurricanes and earthquakes. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, along with an earthquake in Mexico, wildfires in California, monsoon flooding in Bangladesh and a mudslide in Colombia, cost the Lloyd\u2019s market \u00a34.5bn in claims, more than double the previous year when it paid out \u00a32.1bn. The hurricanes, which tore through the southern US and Caribbean last summer, hit Lloyd\u2019s particularly hard because the US accounts for 44% of its business. It said it was its second costliest year for major claims behind 2011. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the Lloyd\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cTo date, the market has paid more than 50% by value of the claims notified in relation to Harvey, Irma and Maria, and is in the process of paying the rest.\u201d He expects 2018 to be another challenging year, and added: \u201cThe market\u2019s 2017 results are proof, if any were needed, that business as usual is not sustainable. As a result the market is embracing new ways of working.\u201d Last year\u2019s 330 natural disasters are estimated to have caused a global economic loss of $353bn (\u00a3251bn), with Harvey, Irma and Maria accounting for 60% of the insured losses. Inga Beale, the Lloyd\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe market experienced an exceptionally difficult year in 2017, driven by challenging market conditions and a significant impact from natural catastrophes. These factors mean that for the first time in six years Lloyd\u2019s is reporting a loss.\u201d The world\u2019s oldest insurance market made a pretax loss of \u00a32bn last year, compared with a \u00a32.1bn profit the previous year. The group\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 a measure of claims and costs as a proportion of premiums \u2013 worsened from 98% to 114%. A figure above 100% indicates a loss. Its annual report showed Beale was paid \u00a31.3m last year, down from \u00a31.5m in 2016. Along with other executives, she did not receive a bonus payout under the Lloyd\u2019s performance plan last year because the LPP only pays out if the company makes an annual profit of more than \u00a3100m. Lloyd\u2019s was one of the first UK businesses to publish its gender pay gap, revealing that women earn 32.1% less than men (for bonuses the gap is even bigger at 40.7%). Beale said she was \u201cnot proud of that at all\u201d and that Lloyd\u2019s was taking action, having signed up to the government\u2019s women in finance charter and introduced a back to work programme for parents. Its goal is to have women in 40% of its top management jobs in the next five years, up from 33.8% today. Women were not allowed into the Lloyd\u2019s underwriting room until 1973, when Liliana Archibald became the first female broker there. Lloyd\u2019s reiterated that its new office in Brussels would be up and running by July, ready to start writing business in January. However, Beale was concerned about what would happen to existing insurance policies across the EU after Brexit. She urged European regulators to agree a solution soon, as transferring the contracts to new entities would be an \u201cunnecessary expense and definitely doesn\u2019t benefit the consumer\u201d. Transferring insurance contracts would take 12-18 months and involve the courts, according to the Bank of England. It estimates 6 million UK policyholders and 30 million policyholders across the rest of the EU could be affected.",

    "webTitle": "Facebook, Google and Amazon could pay 'fair' tax under EU plans", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Amazon, Google and Facebook could be made to pay a \u201cfair\u201d share of tax under new European Union proposals on digital companies that could heighten transatlantic tensions. The European commission called for large technology companies to pay a 3% tax if they make money from user data or digital advertising in a country, regardless of their bricks-and-mortar presence. As well as social media companies making money through user data, the move would also catch online market places, such as Airbnb and Uber. Tech giants have been rattled by the proposals, which are a departure from the current system under which companies are taxed on profits where they are headquartered, often in countries offering lower tax rates. European leaders will discuss the plans at an EU summit on Thursday, opening a fractious debate about how to capture revenue from digital firms. France has led the charge for a digital tax, sometimes nicknamed the Gafa tax, after Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Smaller countries, such as Ireland, Luxembourg and Estonia, fear unilateral EU action could hand an advantage to the US, Japan, or even Brexit Britain. The plans have been in the works for months, before regulators called on Facebook to explain a data breach affecting 50m profiles, or a transatlantic dispute about steel tariffs. Theresa May is set to give cautious backing to the plans at the summit on Thursday. A senior Downing Street source said they recognised the international tax system was designed the best part of a century ago and was no longer suitable for a modern economy. \u201cThey are constructive proposals, we\u2019re going to look at them seriously,\u201d the source said. Despite the long gestation, the digital tax is likely to raise tensions between Brussels and Donald Trump\u2019s White House. The US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told the New York Times that gross taxes on internet companies were \u201cnot fair\u201d, on the sidelines of a debate among G20 finance ministers on taxation in Buenos Aires this week. The commission rejected claims that the plan was targeting US companies. \u201cThis is not an anti-American tax, this is not an anti-Gafa tax, this is a digital tax,\u201d said Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for tax, who said 150 firms would be affected, including European, American and Asian ones. Moscovici said he had stressed this point to ministers at this week\u2019s meeting in the Argentine capital, adding that the commission saw the plans as compatible with EU obligations under the World Trade Organization. The commission believes the tax will generate \u20ac5bn for European treasuries each year, but Moscovici suggested this sum would rise over time. The growing dominance of digital companies is seen as a long-term threat to Europe\u2019s tax base, while also sparking questions of fairness. The commission estimates that digital businesses pay an effective average tax rate of only 9.5%, compared with 23.2% for bricks-and-mortar firms. The proposals must be agreed unanimously by EU member states before they become law, so details may change. The commission\u2019s preferred option is reform of EU corporate tax rules that would include new ways to identify companies with a \u201cdigital presence\u201d. A company would be deemed to have digital presence in a country if its revenues exceed \u20ac7m (\u00a36m), or it has more than 100,000 users, or has signed more than 3,000 business contracts. Pending this bigger reform, the commission is looking at interim measures, such as the 3% tax on revenues from digital activities, which would include selling online advertising space. The measure would only apply to companies with global revenues of \u20ac750m and \u20ac50m in the EU. The commission hopes member states will agree the 3% tax by the end of the year, meaning it is likely the UK would have to apply it during a Brexit transition period mooted to end in 2021.

      "bodyText": "MPs have accused the accountancy firm tasked with salvaging money from Carillion on behalf of its creditors and pensioners of charging \u201csuperhuman\u201d fees, after it racked up a bill for \u00a320.4m in eight weeks. Partners from PricewaterhouseCoopers told the Commons work and pensions committee on Wednesday that they had no idea how much they would ultimately charge, admitting it would be at least June before they could estimate overall costs. MPs had earlier said PwC was attempting to \u201cmilk the Carillion cow dry\u201d with roles at various stages throughout its decline and eventual collapse into liquidation in January owing about \u00a32bn to its 30,000 suppliers. Greg Clark, the business secretary, told the committee he intended to launch an independent inquiry into the operations of the Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy regulator, in the wake of Carillion\u2019s failure. MPs have previously said the watchdog had been \u201cuseless\u201d in its oversight of the company. \u201cThere is a strong case for reviewing the operation of the FRC and that is something that I intend to require,\u201d he said. David Kelly, the special manager for PwC in Carillion\u2019s liquidation, told the committee the accountancy firm was charging about \u00a31.4m a week to employ 112 staff to keep the company running and to honour government contracts, while also trying to sell parts of the business and salvage funds for its creditors. The Pension Protection Fund, a government-backed pensions lifeboat, is likely to pick up all but two of Carillion\u2019s 13 pension schemes and has estimated the funding shortfall for them at about \u00a3900m. Kelly, who said his personal rate was \u00a3865 an hour, said PwC\u2019s costs would gradually fall as more parts of Carillion were sold and staff from the accounting firm stopped working on the project. He said the firm initially had 257 people working on Carillion, with a bill for about \u00a33m for their services in the first week after its collapse. He said that it was too early to say how much money would be recovered from the failure of the company, suggesting PwC would have a better idea in June. Defending the fees, which are yet to be paid but will be settled before claims by other creditors who are owed money, Kelly said it was impossible to estimate the costs given the \u201csheer complexity of the situation we\u2019re dealing with\u201d. \u201cIt depends on the asset realisation process, it depends on the pace at which we can migrate contracts,\u201d he said. Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP in charge of the business select committee, which is jointly investigating the collapse of Carillion alongside the work and pensions committee, said the charges were \u201csuperhuman\u201d. She said: \u201cIf I pay someone \u00a320.4m working for eight weeks, I would expect them to have some grasp of how much it might cost. \u201cIt\u2019s the big four accountancy firms that make a killing advising struggling companies how to turn them round and the big four that make millions tidying up when that advice fails.\u201d A spokesperson for PwC said the firm had helped save more than 8,500 Carillion jobs so far and continued the provision of school dinners and road gritting. \u201cWe were appointed because of our ability to deliver the scale, skills and experience at the speed required to minimise the disruption caused by the collapse of Carillion,\u201d the spokesperson said.",

      "bodyText": "Higher interest rates from the Bank of England have moved a decisive step closer after the latest official figures showed earnings growing at their fastest rate in more than two years. The latest snapshot of the labour market from the Office for National Statistics showed that a record high level of employment and a drift from part-time to full-time work pushed up wages in the three months ending in January. With inflation falling, the ONS said the squeeze on living standards that had dampened consumer spending over the past year had come to an end if bonuses were included in the yardstick used to calculate earnings. Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee is meeting to discuss interest rates this week and the prospect of an increase in borrowing costs pushed up the pound on foreign exchanges. An increase in May is thought more likely than one this week. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cGetting a job means securing an income for a family and the chance to build a better future. That\u2019s why up and down the country we are doing all we can to help people into work.\u201d But the TUC warned the squeeze on living standards was not over. The trade union body\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cIt\u2019s nine years since the recession ended, but wages are still falling and workers\u2019 living standards are worse than a decade ago. \u201cThe great pay squeeze is a long-term crisis. We need major changes to get the economy working again for working people.\u201d The ONS said that including bonuses, average earnings in the three months to January were 2.8% higher than in the same quarter a year earlier, the highest since September 2015. Excluding bonuses, earnings were 2.6% higher. The annual inflation rate has been coming down from a peak of 3.1% last autumn and stood at 2.7% in February. \u201cLatest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms \u2013 that is, adjusted for price inflation \u2013 fell by 0.2% excluding bonuses, but were unchanged including bonuses, compared with a year earlier,\u201d the ONS said. It added that both employment and unemployment rose in the three months ending in January, with the labour market not quite able to absorb a big increase in the number of people entering the workforce after being classified as economically inactive. The number of people in work rose by 168,000 to 32.25 million, pushing up the employment rate to 75.3%, the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. Unemployment on the internationally agreed measure rose by 24,000 in the three months to January, but the jobless rate remained unchanged on the previous quarter at 4.3%. Job vacancies were up 10,000 to 816,000 in the latest three months. Stephen Clarke, a senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s 12-month pay squeeze has finally ended, though public sector workers will have to wait until new pay settlements are agreed across the NHS, schools, the police and other parts of the public sector. \u201cWhile it\u2019s a relief that pay packets are no longer shrinking, the outlook for anaemic pay growth remains a huge living standards concern. Average pay is still lower than it was a decade ago, and an entire generation of young workers are still yet to experience the 3-4% pay rises that were once the norm.\u201d Separate ONS figures showed that the government borrowed \u00a31.3bn in February to bridge the gap between tax receipts and spending, a \u00a32.5bn increase on the same month in 2017, when there was a \u00a31.2bn surplus. The ONS also revised up its estimate of borrowing for the first 10 months of the 2017-18 financial year by \u00a32.5bn as a result of higher spending and weaker receipts. With one month of the year still to go, borrowing stood at \u00a341.4bn \u2013 \u00a32.5bn lower than a year ago.",

      "bodyText": "Politicians and regulators won\u2019t be the only people who want a word with Mark Zuckerberg. With Facebook\u2019s shares sliding more than 10% since the data breach involving Cambridge Analytica, shareholders would probably also like to quiz their chief executive about how he has been running the firm. But what are outside investors\u2019 chances of exerting real influence? What if, after a few more chapters in this saga, the majority owners of Facebook conclude the \u201ccatastrophic failure of process\u201d, as one MP put it, is so damaging that a new boss is required to restore credibility in the eyes of users, advertisers and the outside world? The short answer is that those investors would struggle to change the boardroom line-up. Zuckerberg owns only about 16% of Facebook but he has 60% of the votes, having achieved control by creating a class of stock with 10 times the voting rights of normal shares. To British eyes, the arrangement looks outrageous. Dual-voting structures at public companies were largely dismantled in the 1990s when they were deemed an affront to the idea that equal economic risk should imply equal voting power. In US technology sector, however, they prosper. Technology companies born in the 21st century prefer governance structures that belong in the 19th century. Google, Facebook, Groupon, LinkedIn and TripAdvisor all have unequal voting rights. Snap, owner of Snapchat, even managed to issue a class of share with zero votes. The thin justification is usually that the founders are geniuses who require complete freedom to pursue their visions. Being truly accountable to shareholders, with their grubby short-term concerns, is a distraction from the pursuit of greater long-term glory \u2013 or so the argument goes. It is astonishing that US investors, even in their greed to get on the next tech hit, tolerated such guff. But they did, and still do. Dropbox, an internet storage firm, and Spotify want to take the same route. One cannot, of course, say Facebook has been asleep to data risks because Zuckerberg is insulated via his super-charged shares. Nor can one say that harder accountability to owners would have made the company do anything differently, such as recognising the risk in allowing political messages to run like commercial adverts on the platform. But a proper voice for shareholders might have helped to puncture the instinctive defensiveness that Facebook displays whenever its \u201csocial mission\u201d is questioned. In the circumstances, the severe reaction in the share price is not a surprise. This is a $490bn company with a boss whose voting power means he cannot be removed against his wishes. That arrangement looks fine in good times \u2013 not so when crisis strikes. GKN v Melrose: the battle continues Another day, another tit-for-tat round of exchanges between GKN and Melrose over pensions, each side claiming its plan is superior. Who\u2019s right? Actually, that\u2019s the wrong question. It is the view of the trustees of GKN\u2019s pension funds that matters. The trustees have declared that GKN\u2019s version provides \u201cappropriate mitigation\u201d but what of Melrose\u2019s offer of \u201cup to\u201d \u00a31bn? It looks OK to the unpractised eye, but what do the experts think? They should hurry up and give a view. Voting on this takeover bid closes on Thursday next week and, at the margin, pensions could influence some shareholders. It seems unfair that one side has a thumbs-up and the other hasn\u2019t got an opinion. Melrose should have done itself a favour by approaching the Pensions Regulator for clearance, as it was asked to do. But the GKN trustees should still speak up soon. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 March 2018 to correct the valuation of Facebook from $66bn to $490bn.",

Technology companies born in the 21st century prefer governance structures that belong in the 19th century. Google, Facebook, Groupon, LinkedIn and TripAdvisor all have unequal voting rights. Snap, owner of Snapchat, even managed to issue a class of share with zero votes.</p> <p>The thin justification is usually that the founders are geniuses who require complete freedom to pursue their visions. Being truly accountable to shareholders, with their grubby short-term concerns, is a distraction from the pursuit of greater long-term glory \u2013 or so the argument goes. It is astonishing that US investors, even in their greed to get on the next tech hit, tolerated such guff. But they did, and still do. Dropbox, an internet storage firm, and Spotify want to take the same route.</p> <p>One cannot, of course, say Facebook has been asleep to data risks because Zuckerberg is insulated via his super-charged shares. Nor can one say that harder accountability to owners would have made the company do anything differently, such as recognising the risk in allowing political messages to run like commercial adverts on the platform. But a proper voice for shareholders might have helped to puncture the instinctive defensiveness that Facebook displays whenever its \u201csocial mission\u201d is questioned.</p> <p>In the circumstances, the severe reaction in the share price is not a surprise. This is a $490bn company with a boss whose voting power means he cannot be removed against his wishes. That arrangement looks fine in good times \u2013 not so when crisis strikes.</p> <h2>GKN v Melrose: the battle continues </h2> <p>Another day, another tit-for-tat round of exchanges between GKN and Melrose over pensions, each side claiming its plan is superior. Who\u2019s right? Actually, that\u2019s the wrong question. It is the view of the trustees of GKN\u2019s pension funds that matters. The trustees have declared that GKN\u2019s version provides \u201cappropriate mitigation\u201d but what of Melrose\u2019s offer of \u201cup to\u201d \u00a31bn? It looks OK to the unpractised eye, but what do the experts think?</p> <p>They should hurry up and give a view. Voting on this takeover bid closes on Thursday next week and, at the margin, pensions could influence some shareholders. It seems unfair that one side has a thumbs-up and the other hasn\u2019t got an opinion.</p> <p>Melrose should have done itself a favour by approaching the Pensions Regulator for clearance, as it was asked to do. But the GKN trustees should still speak up soon.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 March 2018 to correct the valuation of Facebook from $66bn to $490bn.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "UK house builder Bellway said it was on track to build more than 10,000 homes this year for the first time, despite an industry-wide shortage of materials such as bricks and roof tiles. Jason Honeyman, Bellway\u2019s chief operating officer, said the shortage was exacerbated by a higher demand for bricks in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, as construction firms sought alternatives to cladding. Materials are taking about three or four months to arrive \u2013 both from within the UK and overseas \u2013 instead of two to four weeks. Some roof tiles are in such short supply that they take five to six months to be delivered to building sites, Honeyman said. In addition, the weaker pound has pushed up the cost of imported materials. Bellway\u2019s building costs rose 3% in the first half and this is likely to continue in the second half. Honeyman said bricks and roof tiles had risen even more in price, by 6-7%. He added that shortages of skilled builders \u2013 a perennial issue in the housebuilding industry \u2013 were less of an issue for Bellway at the moment. Overall, the company said it was benefiting from a \u201cfavourable\u201d backdrop of low interest rates and mortgage availability, as well as a focus on homes priced in the middle-to-lower end of the market, predominantly outside London where demand is slowing. Newcastle-based Bellway sold 4,741 homes in the first half of its financial year to the end of January, an increase of 6.3% on the same period a year earlier. It has put the housebuilder on course to complete a record number of houses in the full year to the end of July, as consumer confidence is \u201cseemingly unaffected by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming exit from the EU\u201d, the company said. The average selling price of a Bellway home was \u00a3275,945 in the first half, up 7.7%. \u201cThe group has invested significantly in land to achieve future growth, in a market place in which customer demand is robust and mortgage availability remains good,\u201d said John Watson, Bellway\u2019s executive chairman. \u201cThis positive trading environment, together with a substantial order book, bodes well for the full year and should enable the group to complete in excess of 10,000 new homes.\u201d The company said its nationwide presence and lower price had insulated it from the slump in London, where would-be buyers have found themselves priced out of the market. Aside from The Residence, its flagship development in Nine Elms in Battersea, Bellway has few sites in central London. The company\u2019s focus is on outer London boroughs, where demand has held up better, and the commuter belt, Manchester, the Midlands and Scotland. Bellway has sold the majority of the 514 homes at The Residence, with 100 apartments left to sell before construction finishes next winter. Meanwhile annual growth in UK house prices edged down to 4.9% in the year to January from 5% a month earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. The weakest growth was in the north-east, at 0.7%, followed by London, where prices grew by 2.1%. Over the month, the average price of a home fell by 0.3% to \u00a3225,621. \u201cHouse price growth remained steady, with prices increasing strongly across much of the country, although London and the north east are both lagging behind,\u201d said Phil Gooding, a statistician at the ONS. Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, said the latest ONS figures suggested that \u201cprices will do little more than tread water this year and edge down in London\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Partners from PricewaterhouseCoopers will be questioned by the work and pensions committee on Wednesday about the accounting firm\u2019s role in the collapse of Carillion, with PwC accused of attempting to \u201cmilk the Carillion cow dry\u201d. The committee said the correspondence between the Pensions Regulator and Carillion exposed the regulator\u2019s weak position and the key role played by PwC. Most of the regulator\u2019s negotiations were conducted via PwC, which advised Carillion\u2019s directors on managing their pensions liabilities from 2012 to 2017. In the autumn of 2017, PwC became advisers to the pension scheme trustees; it was also advising the government on its dealings with Carillion. After the construction firm\u2019s collapse on 15 January, PwC was appointed special manager, tasked with trying to salvage money for the Pension Protection Fund. The PPF is likely to pick up all but two of Carillion\u2019s 13 pension schemes and has estimated the funding shortfall for the schemes at about \u00a3900m. It would cost an estimated \u00a32.6bn for a pension firm to buy out the defined-benefit schemes, which is unlikely to happen. Frank Field, the chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, said: \u201cPwC had every incentive to milk the Carillion cow dry. Then, when Carillion finally collapsed, PwC adroitly re-emerged as butcher, packaging up joints of the fallen beast to be flogged off. \u201cFor this they are handsomely rewarded by the taxpayer. They claim to be experts in every aspects of company management. They\u2019re certainly expert in ensuring they get their cut at every stage.\u201d Three partners from PwC will face questions from MPs as part of the joint inquiry by the work and pensions committee and business committee into the collapse of Carillion: Marissa Thomas, head of deals; David Kelly, special manager; and Gavin Stoner, restructuring and pensions. MPs on the two select committees have already accused the \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firms of \u201cfeasting on what was soon to become a carcass\u201d. KPMG, Deloitte, EY and PwC banked \u00a372m for work carried out on Carillion, its pension scheme and its government contracts in the 10 years leading to its failure. Greg Clark, the business secretary, and Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, will also appear before the committees on Wednesday at a separate session. They will be asked about the lessons from Carillion, especially in relation to the just-announced white paper on defined-benefit pensions and the consultation on corporate governance. Field stepped up his criticism of the Pensions Regulator (TPR) for not using its powers effectively with Carillion in forcing it to make higher contributions to its pension schemes. Field said the regulator\u2019s performance before the joint committees last month gave him \u201cno assurance that the TPR leadership is equipped to bring about the necessary cultural change\u201d. He added: \u201cIt would hardly have scheme sponsors quaking in their boots and it is difficult to imagine TPR emerging victorious from negotiations with a ruthless American private equity firm.\u201d",

The Centre for Cities thinktank said urban renaissance in Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham and Liverpool had been so marked that problems of urban decay had been replaced by a need to find room for further expansion. Calling for changes to planning laws to permit commercial and residential development, the thinktank said the central districts of England\u2019s big regional cities had all seen their populations grow more than six times as quickly as that of central London. When measured by a combination of jobs and population increase, Manchester had seen the fastest city centre growth in England and Wales in the period 2002-2015, followed closely by Leeds, Birmingham and Liverpool. London was in 20th position. The thinktank said the big regional cities were starting from a low base compared to London but were also benefitting from the desire of knowledge-based businesses to be based in city centres. Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: \u201c30 years ago the centres of places like Manchester and Birmingham were run-down and struggling, but since then they have undergone a dramatic transformation and have become increasingly attractive locations for people to live and work in.\u201d Britain has a distinct north-south economic divide, with the richer parts of the country lying below a line drawn from the Wash to the Severn estuary. London has been the fastest growing region over the past 20 years and led the way during the recovery from the deep recession of 2008-09, but the thinktank said the city centres expanding most rapidly were in parts of the country seeking to shake off their post-industrial hangovers. A separate report last week from Your Move \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s biggest estate agency chains \u2013 showed that while property prices were falling in London they were rising in the north-west. The Centre for Cities warned that recovery in Manchester and elsewhere could be undermined by planning polices that prioritise residential development over commercial space in city centres. It said permitted development right, which allow commercial space to be converted for residential use without planning permission, posed a threat to commercial property needed to attract firms and jobs to city centres. The thinktank\u2019s report recommended that the government should allow cities to exclude their centres from permitted development rights, and that cities should relax planning laws \u2013 including controlled development of green belt land \u2013 to allow more house building in other areas. \u201cThis urban renaissance has brought opportunities for people living across these cities and their surrounding areas, and it\u2019s vital that it continues,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBut for that to happen, cities need to take tough decisions on how to sustain the growth of their commercial centres, while also providing the homes their residents need.\u201d",
