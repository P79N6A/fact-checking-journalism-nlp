      "bodyText": "Sales at the online fashion retailer Boohoo doubled at Christmas as young women flocked to the website for party outfits and gifts. The Manchester-based company, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing [PLT] and Nasty Gal online brands, is winning sales from traditional high street retailers as it cashes in on a generation that shops via their mobile phones and takes style cues from social media. Boohoo said group sales surged 100% year-on-year to \u00a3228.2m in the four months to 31 December, thanks to stellar sales during the Black Friday promotional bonanza in November. Sales at PLT, where hundreds of new products are added to the website every day to satisfy its fashion hungry shoppers, were up 191% on the previous year. Boohoo\u2019s USP is inexpensive clothing aimed at fashion-conscious women, with its figure-hugging Lycra dresses starting at \u00a310 while thigh-high boots cost \u00a330. Its sharp pricing is giving high street rivals such as Primark a run for their money as it targets young shoppers with limited finances. The standout performance by Boohoo comes as Britons\u2019 finances are squeezed by slow wage growth and higher inflation, a predicament that forced them to cut back on buying almost everything other than food in the run-up to Christmas. Retailers with strong digital operations are proving to be more insulated from the downturn in consumer demand than those with large store networks to run. Earlier this week, fashion company Ted Baker also reported higher sales over Christmas thanks to a surge in online purchases. Boohoo was set up in 2006 by Mahmud Kamani and his business partner, Carol Kane, who previously supplied high street rivals such as Primark and New Look. The duo share the role of chief executive. Its shares have soared in value since listing on the stock exchange in 2014. When it joined the stock exchange, the company\u2019s shares were worth 50p but are now worth nearly four times that. Charlotte Pearce, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said Boohoo\u2019s brands were luring dissatisfied shoppers away from the likes of New Look, Miss Selfridge and H&amp;M. \u201cThe group stands out compared to online rivals such as Missguided and Quiz thanks to its innate understanding of its core shopper base, its low-priced on-trend product and its well-targeted marketing and social media.\u201d Pearce said Boohoo had relied on a campaign of heavy discounting to win customers by offering Black Friday discounts of between 30% and 60%. \u201cWhile its relentless discounting activity needs attention, boohoo.com\u2019s product and brand presence is clearly winning over 16-24 year old shoppers.\u201d In a joint statement, Kamani and Kane said: \u201cWe are delighted to report another set of strong financial and operational results, with record sales in the four months to December across all our brands. \u201cThe Black Friday period was our most successful ever. PrettyLittleThing has continued to deliver exceptional results and Nasty Gal is making excellent progress in its first year. \u201cOur focus remains on the customer proposition: offering the best range of the latest fashion at affordable prices, coupled with great customer service.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Talks over the future of loss-making Four Seasons Health Care, which looks after 17,000 elderly and vulnerable people, hit a fresh snag after minority bondholders claimed the company\u2019s biggest lender is trying to push through measures that are not in the firm\u2019s best interest. US investment firm H/2 Capital Partners, which owns the majority of Four Seasons\u2019 bonds, has agreed a \u201cstandstill\u201d deal that defers crippling interest payments, allowing time for a restructuring of the debt-laden company. Minority bondholders support this but a group holding about \u00a3100m of the debt have been angered by conditions attached to the deal, drawn up by H/2 and Four Seasons without their involvement. The row threatens to complicate rescue talks, which are already fraught due to icy relations between H/2 and Terra Firma, the private equity group that still owns Four Seasons. Terra Firm is seeking an exit after austerity cuts to local authority social care budgets and increased nursing costs rendered its debt-fuelled model unsustainable. Cheyne Capital, which has lent money to Four Seasons since 2006, said the standstill agreement includes terms that \u201cprejudice the contractual rights and position of the minority bondholders as well as the company\u201d. \u201cIf H2 cannot reach agreement with the company on terms that do not adversely impact the rights of the minority bondholders, then we would urge the company to seek alternative funding suitors to work with,\u201d it added. Continuing with the existing terms would limit Four Seasons\u2019 ability to secure the best restructuring deal during rescue talks due to continue over the next few months, the lender warned. M&amp;G, the investment arm of global insurer Prudential, is thought have similar concerns to Cheyne but declined to comment. H/2 also declined to comment. Sources close to minority bondholders stressed that the dispute will not put at risk the survival of the company. Cheyne and fellow lenders are expected to argue that the agreement cannot be legally applied, which could complicate ongoing efforts to restructure the company\u2019s long-term finances. The dispute revolves around several key clauses, one of which prevents Four Seasons from repaying any other creditors without express permission from H/2. If Four Seasons were offered new cheap loans as part of the upcoming restructuring effort, it could not accept them unless H/2 allowed it to repay existing loans first, one source said. The agreement also allows H/2 to force Four Seasons to refinance its debt with an entity nominated by the US company. H/2 would also have the power to stop Four Seasons from paying interest to bondholders holding a higher ranking debt without paying those with lower ranking bonds. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nobody expected Christmas trading miracles from Marks &amp; Spencer, but surely chief executive Steve Rowe would be able to unveil some juicy figures for the online operation. Didn\u2019t M&amp;S, under predecessor Marc Bolland, go through agonies to build its expensive distribution centre at Castle Donington \u2013 the one with nine miles of hanging garments? Wasn\u2019t the website revamped to relegate the magazine-style fluff and make it sell more stuff? Aren\u2019t clothing retailers constantly telling us that the \u201cchannel shift\u201d to online continues to accelerate? Yet somehow the sales growth at M&amp;S.com was a miserable 3% in an online market for non-food goods that is generally reckoned to be motoring at about 8%. That 3% should alarm shareholders as much as the 0.4% fall in like-for-like food sales at a time of inflation. That is because, there\u2019s little mystery about M&amp;S\u2019s online shocker. Despite massive investment in logistics over the years, the system still isn\u2019t up to speed. When Rowe talks about \u201crestrictions on our ability\u201d at Donington and \u201cmanaging the proposition quite carefully over the last few weeks\u201d, he means M&amp;S too often missed its next-day delivery targets to customers. That news will rightly provoke groans from shareholders who had been told years ago that Donington was the answer to their prayers and was merely suffering a few teething problems. The issues are plainly more serious. Without a fast and reliable distribution operation, a retailer is fighting with one arm behind its back in today\u2019s market. The trading part of Rowe\u2019s strategy is to restore \u201cprice integrity\u201d by getting prices lower and by refusing to join the Black Friday silliness. That sounds entirely sensible \u2013 about time. But, again, it\u2019s not a quick fix. The benefits, assuming they arrive, come over the long-term and M&amp;S needs fresh ideas in food to combat supermarkets who have copied its best tricks. Cauliflower steaks \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 weren\u2019t the answer. In the circumstances, it was a mini-triumph that M&amp;S left its full-year profit guidance unchanged. But, as the 7% damage to the share price indicates, investors have now clicked that Rowe was serious about the timetable when he unveiled his five-year plan last year. Nice Paddington advertisements, but the nuts and bolts of retailing matter more. Don\u2019t believe the hype at Tesco Tesco used the word \u201coutperformance\u201d five times in its Christmas statement. \u201cRecord\u201d got six mentions and \u201cstrong\u201d was shoehorned in eight times. An overdose of hype usually suggests an oversensitive chief executive. If so, David Lewis\u2019s mood will not have been improved by the reaction in the share price \u2013 down 4%. The market isn\u2019t always right, but that snap judgment looks fair. Lewis, the hotshot hire from Unilever in 2014, has engineered a turnaround that is competent and solid but so far unremarkable. From the point of view of investors, the big breakout \u2013 the moment when Tesco asserts its market leadership again and leaves rivals in the shade \u2013 seems perpetually to lie around the next corner. Like-for-like UK sales improved by 2.3% in the third quarter but the rate of growth slipped to 1.9% over Christmas period. The figures were good on food \u2013 not so hot on non-food \u2013 but the City had primed itself for more. This, after all, was Lewis\u2019s fourth Christmas in charge. On the plus side, Tesco is \u201cfirmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions\u201d, which is shorthand for saying the goal of restoring profit margins to 3.5%-4% is intact. Fine, but there\u2019s another way to view the medium term at Tesco. The share price is virtually the same as after Lewis\u2019s first Christmas report \u2013 a smidgen over 200p. Save the hyperbole for another day, Dave. In share price terms, Morrisons\u2019 recovery from its own heart attack has been faster and slicker. South Korea shows states won\u2019t sit on the sidelines over bitcoin If keeping a check on the value of your investment requires you to monitor hour-by-hour announcements from the South Korean justice ministry, it\u2019s probably time to try something else. True bitcoin enthusiasts won\u2019t, of course. Instead, it\u2019s possible that South Korea\u2019s clampdown on cryptocurrencies (which turned out to be a proposal to ban trading via exchanges, rather than immediate action) will be interpreted as a reason to buy. The back-to-front logic will be that, if the authorities are getting heavy, then cryptocurrencies must be the real deal. Thus prepare for more rollercoaster days and nights when the value of bitcoin can fall by $2,000 (\u00a31,500), or about 14%, and then recover. But, if the South Korean episode shows anything, it\u2019s that governments are not going to stand idly on the sidelines if they suspect cryptocurrencies are being used to dodge taxes. Boring economists and bankers have made that argument for ages \u2013 and they\u2019re right to do so. States like to protect the integrity of their monetary systems. If cryptocurrencies become a problem, governments will act. The South Korean authorities may be moving prematurely, but their local bitcoin mania is world-beating. Punters have been paying 30% over prices elsewhere. If economists don\u2019t convince, try Warren Buffett. \u201cI can say almost with certainty that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end,\u201d he said this week. Remember, he\u2019s the greatest investor the world has seen in the past century.",

      "body": "<p>Nobody expected Christmas trading miracles from Marks &amp; Spencer, but surely chief executive Steve Rowe would be able to unveil some juicy figures for the online operation.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t M&amp;S, under predecessor Marc Bolland, go through agonies to build its expensive distribution centre at Castle Donington \u2013 the one with nine miles of hanging garments? </p> <p>Wasn\u2019t the website revamped to relegate the magazine-style fluff and make it sell more stuff? Aren\u2019t clothing retailers constantly telling us that the \u201cchannel shift\u201d to online continues to accelerate?</p> <p>Yet somehow the sales growth at M&amp;S.com was a miserable 3% in an online market for non-food goods that is generally reckoned to be motoring at about 8%. That 3% should alarm shareholders as much as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/11/tesco-and-john-lewis-enjoy-a-good-christmas-but-ms-downbeat\">the 0.4% fall in like-for-like food sales</a> at a time of inflation.</p> <p>That is because, there\u2019s little mystery about M&amp;S\u2019s online shocker. Despite massive investment in logistics over the years, the system still isn\u2019t up to speed. </p> <p>When Rowe talks about \u201crestrictions on our ability\u201d at Donington and \u201cmanaging the proposition quite carefully over the last few weeks\u201d, he means M&amp;S too often missed its next-day delivery targets to customers.</p> <p>That news will rightly provoke groans from shareholders who had been told years ago that Donington was the answer to their prayers and was merely suffering a few teething problems. The issues are plainly more serious. Without a fast and reliable distribution operation, a retailer is fighting with one arm behind its back in today\u2019s market.</p> <p>The trading part of Rowe\u2019s strategy is to restore \u201cprice integrity\u201d by getting prices lower and by refusing to join the Black Friday silliness. That sounds entirely sensible \u2013 about time. </p> <p>But, again, it\u2019s not a quick fix. The benefits, assuming they arrive, come over the long-term and M&amp;S needs fresh ideas in food to combat supermarkets who have copied its best tricks. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/10/ms-ditches-2-cauliflower-steak-aka-slice-amid-ridicule-from-customers\">Cauliflower steaks</a> \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 weren\u2019t the answer.</p> <p>In the circumstances, it was a mini-triumph that M&amp;S left its full-year profit guidance unchanged. But, as the 7% damage to the share price indicates, investors have now clicked that Rowe was serious about the timetable when he unveiled his five-year plan last year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/07/ms-christmas-ad-paddington-bear-marks-spencer-john-lewis\">Nice Paddington advertisements</a>, but the nuts and bolts of retailing matter more.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t believe the hype at Tesco</h2> <p>Tesco used the word \u201coutperformance\u201d five times in its Christmas statement. \u201cRecord\u201d got six mentions and \u201cstrong\u201d was shoehorned in eight times. An overdose of hype usually suggests an oversensitive chief executive. If so, David Lewis\u2019s mood will not have been improved by the reaction in the share price \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/11/tesco-and-john-lewis-enjoy-a-good-christmas-but-ms-downbeat\">down 4%</a>.</p> <p>The market isn\u2019t always right, but that snap judgment looks fair. Lewis, the hotshot hire from Unilever in 2014, has engineered a turnaround that is competent and solid but so far unremarkable. From the point of view of investors, the big breakout \u2013 the moment when Tesco asserts its market leadership again and leaves rivals in the shade \u2013 seems perpetually to lie around the next corner.</p> <p>Like-for-like UK sales improved by 2.3% in the third quarter but the rate of growth slipped to 1.9% over Christmas period. The figures were good on food \u2013 not so hot on non-food \u2013 but the City had primed itself for more. This, after all, was Lewis\u2019s fourth Christmas in charge.</p> <p>On the plus side, Tesco is \u201cfirmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions\u201d, which is shorthand for saying the goal of restoring profit margins to 3.5%-4% is intact. Fine, but there\u2019s another way to view the medium term at Tesco. The share price is virtually the same as after Lewis\u2019s first Christmas report \u2013 a smidgen over 200p.</p> <p>Save the hyperbole for another day, Dave. In share price terms, Morrisons\u2019 recovery from its own heart attack has been faster and slicker.</p> <h2>South Korea shows states won\u2019t sit on the sidelines over bitcoin </h2> <p>If keeping a check on the value of your investment requires you to monitor hour-by-hour announcements from the South Korean justice ministry, it\u2019s probably time to try something else.</p> <p>True bitcoin enthusiasts won\u2019t, of course. Instead, it\u2019s possible that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/11/bitcoin-drops-value-south-korea-trading-ban-cryptocurrencies-tax-gambling\">South Korea\u2019s clampdown on cryptocurrencies</a> (which turned out to be a proposal to ban trading via exchanges, rather than immediate action) will be interpreted as a reason to buy. The back-to-front logic will be that, if the authorities are getting heavy, then cryptocurrencies must be the real deal.</p> <p>Thus prepare for more rollercoaster days and nights when the value of bitcoin can fall by $2,000 (\u00a31,500), or about 14%, and then recover. </p> <p>But, if the South Korean episode shows anything, it\u2019s that governments are not going to stand idly on the sidelines if they suspect cryptocurrencies are being used to dodge taxes.</p> <p>Boring economists and bankers have made that argument for ages \u2013 and they\u2019re right to do so. States like to protect the integrity of their monetary systems. If cryptocurrencies become a problem, governments will act. </p> <p>The South Korean authorities may be moving prematurely, but their local bitcoin mania is world-beating. Punters have been paying 30% over prices elsewhere.</p> <p>If economists don\u2019t convince, try Warren Buffett. \u201cI can say almost with certainty that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/10/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies-will-come-to-a-bad-end-says-warren-buffett\">he said this week</a>. Remember, he\u2019s the greatest investor the world has seen in the past century.</p>",

    "webTitle": "BHS ex-owner Dominic Chappell guilty of not disclosing information", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, has been found guilty of three charges of failing to provide vital documents to the pensions watchdog. Chappell, 51, was charged with neglecting or refusing to respond to three section 72 notices demanding he hand over vital documents and information relating to the purchase of the company. He led the Retail Acquisitions consortium that bought BHS from Sir Philip Green for a nominal \u00a31 in 2015. It subsequently crashed, with 11,000 jobs lost, 13 months later \u2013 leaving a pensions black hole of about \u00a3571m. Chappell was found guilty of all three charges after a trial at Brighton magistrates court this week and faces an unlimited fine for failing to comply with the notices. After six and a half hours of deliberation, district judge William Ashworth said some of the evidence given by Chappell was \u201cnot credible\u201d, with some of his explanations \u201cmaking no sense\u201d. Ashworth said: \u201cAll the requests made were valid and reasonable and all the time frames to fulfil these requests were also reasonable.\u201d The judge said some of the evidence was \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and Chappell\u2019s excuses for not providing the information were unreliable. Chappell sat in the dock and did not react as judgment was delivered. Outside court, Chappell said he would be appealing against the verdict. He said: \u201cAs you can imagine, I\u2019m extremely disappointed and annoyed about the outcome. It\u2019s not the one we were looking for. \u201cI\u2019ve instructed my legal team to put in an immediate application for an appeal on this case. We feel that this case has not been treated fairly and we will look deeply into this.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Pensions Regulator (TPR) said: \u201cDominic Chappell failed to provide us with information we had requested in connection with our investigation into the sale and ultimate collapse of BHS, despite numerous requests. \u201cAnyone who fails to cooperate with our information notices risks getting a criminal record.\u201d While there have been successful prosecutions brought in the past, including one woman who was tried in her absence, Chappell is the first person to be convicted after denying such an offence at trial, the regulator said. The regulator had demanded hundreds of documents from Chappell in relation to the \u00a3571m pension black hole at BHS just days after the company collapsed in April 2016. It made a second request in May 2016 and a further approach in February 2017. The regulator, which has a responsibility to safeguard pensions, was seeking to protect the pensions of 19,000 members. It subsequently agreed a deal with Green that he should pay \u00a3363m towards the pension deficit. Michael Levy, defending, told Brighton magistrates court that Chappell was a \u201cpolitical scapegoat\u201d for the failure of the high street chain. He claimed Chappell had been \u201cset up to fail\u201d and the case against him was a \u201csham\u201d and a \u201cshow trial\u201d. The court heard that shortly before Chappell bought the company, staff had been seen putting bin bags of documents into an industrial-sized shredder located in the back of the BHS headquarters in London. Alex Stein, prosecuting, said a \u201cstick and carrot\u201d approach had been used to try to get Chappell to comply with the notices but the actions were \u201calways reasonable\u201d under the parliamentary statute. He said: \u201cThis defendant has refused to provide, to the best of his abilities, responses to the section 72s. \u201cWhen you look at all of the evidence as a whole, you get a clear picture of obfuscation on behalf of the defendant.\u201d The case is not the end of the line for Chappell as the regulator is still seeking money from him to help plug the BHS pension deficit. It is understood to be seeking more than \u00a310m from Chappell. \u201cOur separate anti-avoidance action against Dominic Chappell continues. TPR\u2019s determinations panel is considering evidence submitted by various parties and is expected to be in a position to issue its written determination notice to affected parties in the coming weeks,\u201d the regulator\u2019s spokeswoman said. Chappell will be sentenced in Winchester on Friday 19 January. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What does Sadiq Khan\u2019s Brexit report say? A no-deal Brexit would leave Britain\u2019s economy diminished and its people poorer. That is the conclusion of the economic forecast commissioned by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan from Cambridge Econometrics. It\u2019s not the first report to argue that crashing out of the European Union would be bad for business, but it is one of the most comprehensive and draws on a wide range of existing studies. It concludes: \u201cThe more severe the type of Brexit, the greater the negative impact will be on the UK.\u201d What do the Brexit numbers tell us? By 2030, Britain\u2019s national income, using the measure gross value added, which approximates to GDP, will be 3% lower should the UK crash out of the EU without a transition deal or any form of trade agreement. It\u2019s not better under what the report\u2019s authors call scenario four, which allows for a transition deal, when the loss of GDP will be 2.7%. Scenario one allows for full membership of the single market and customs union and is considered to be equivalent to the status quo while scenarios two and three are based on membership of one or the other. Whichever path is adopted, from two to five, there will be a long slow slide in GDP compared to current forecasts. It won\u2019t replicate the collapse that the economy experienced in the wake of the 2008 financial crash, but there will be a cumulative loss that will be huge nonetheless, the report says. Do the numbers stack up? As a piece of future gazing and guesstimating, it is much more circumspect than the Treasury\u2019s pre-referendum vote warnings. The Treasury, under George Osborne chancellorship, predicted that voting for Brexit would cost every household \u00a34,300 or 6% of GDP. It was considered by many to be exaggerated scaremongering that forecast a dive in trade with the rest of the EU. There are still plenty of assumptions in the Cambridge forecast, including the way trade with the rest of the world will be affected, how much the size of the working population will decline and whether a decade of low productivity will come to an end. What is the worst outcome? A breakdown of the impact from crashing out of the EU with no transition or final deal shows that there will be over half a million fewer jobs than previously expected and nearly \u00a350bn in investment lost by 2030. Trade with the rest of the world will be down, and not just trade with our neighbours. The London School of Economics has showed how changes in tariffs and regulations can change the level of imports and exports. The Cambridge study used this study, but ditched widely held economic law, known as the gravity model, that argues countries trade with their neighbours first and foremost, in favour of simple cause and effect of trade barriers on current business relationships. This it hopes, provides a more realistic and less theoretical basis for arguing that trade links with Europe will suffer badly outside the single market and customs union. Is there a regional bias? The analysis by Cambridge Econometrics predicts that a no-deal Brexit could mean London loses as many as 87,000 jobs, with the capital\u2019s economic output 2% lower in 2030 than what would be expected under a soft Brexit. Ben Gardiner, one of the authors of the Cambridge report, said previous reports had found that London was one of the worst affected due to its strong connections with the continent and dependence on finance and an international labour force. \u201cBut our analysis shows that London is one of the most resilient economies in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only has it increased its share of the UK\u2019s GDP over many years, gaining in importance, it has shown itself to be very resilient and robust with a young and flexible workforce that bounces back strongly from any upsets.\u201d That leaves the north-east and Midlands, which export more goods per head of population, to suffer the most from a no-deal Brexit. Is there a silver lining? There could be the Japan-ification of the UK economy. The report expects all parts of the UK economy to shrink over the next 12 years from trade and investment to employment and government revenues. But with the population also expected to fall significantly from current official projections, the number of people in the country needing jobs and government services will be lower, allowing for only marginal falls in GDP per head. In Japan, GDP has remained largely static for two decades and yet the population has remained largely satisfied. This follows a decline in the population that means GDP per head increases. Another silver lining could be that trade with other parts of the world takes off in defiance of current economic models. That is the basis of studies by the Economists for Brexit group, which have argued that UK firms, freed from stifling EU regulations, would find they can expand the number of export destinations for their goods and services.",

      "body": "<h2><br></h2> <h2>What does Sadiq Khan\u2019s Brexit report say? </h2> <p>A no-deal Brexit would leave Britain\u2019s economy diminished and its people poorer. That is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/11/brexit-uk-could-lose-half-a-million-jobs-with-no-deal-says-sadiq-khan\">the conclusion of the economic forecast commissioned by the mayor</a> of London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan\">Sadiq Khan</a> from Cambridge Econometrics. It\u2019s not the first report to argue that crashing out of the European Union would be bad for business, but it is one of the most comprehensive and draws on a wide range of existing studies. It concludes: \u201cThe more severe the type of Brexit, the greater the negative impact will be on the UK.\u201d</p> <h2>What do the Brexit numbers tell us?</h2> <p>By 2030, Britain\u2019s national income, using the measure gross value added, which approximates to GDP, will be 3% lower should the UK crash out of the EU without a transition deal or any form of trade agreement. It\u2019s not better under what the report\u2019s authors call scenario four, which allows for a transition deal, when the loss of GDP will be 2.7%. Scenario one allows for full membership of the single market and customs union and is considered to be equivalent to the status quo while scenarios two and three are based on membership of one or the other.</p> <p>Whichever path is adopted, from two to five, there will be a long slow slide in GDP compared to current forecasts. It won\u2019t replicate the collapse that the economy experienced in the wake of the 2008 financial crash, but there will be a cumulative loss that will be huge nonetheless, the report says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/11/brexit-uk-could-lose-half-a-million-jobs-with-no-deal-says-sadiq-khan\">Brexit: UK could lose half a million jobs with no deal, says Sadiq Khan</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Do the numbers stack up?</h2> <p>As a piece of future gazing and guesstimating, it is much more circumspect than the Treasury\u2019s pre-referendum vote warnings. The Treasury, under George Osborne chancellorship, predicted that voting for Brexit would cost every household \u00a34,300 or 6% of GDP. It was considered by many to be exaggerated scaremongering that forecast a dive in trade with the rest of the EU.</p> <p>There are still plenty of assumptions in the Cambridge forecast, including the way trade with the rest of the world will be affected, how much the size of the working population will decline and whether a decade of low productivity will come to an end.</p> <h2>What is the worst outcome?</h2> <p>A breakdown of the impact from crashing out of the EU with no transition or final deal shows that there will be over half a million fewer jobs than previously expected and nearly \u00a350bn in investment lost by 2030. Trade with the rest of the world will be down, and not just trade with our neighbours.</p> <p>The London School of Economics has showed how changes in tariffs and regulations can change the level of imports and exports. The Cambridge study used this study, but ditched widely held economic law, known as the gravity model, that argues countries trade with their neighbours first and foremost, in favour of simple cause and effect of trade barriers on current business relationships. This it hopes, provides a more realistic and less theoretical basis for arguing that trade links with Europe will suffer badly outside the single market and customs union.</p> <h2>Is there a regional bias?</h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/brexit-analysis\">analysis by Cambridge Econometrics</a> predicts that a no-deal Brexit could mean London loses as many as 87,000 jobs, with the capital\u2019s economic output 2% lower in 2030 than what would be expected under a soft Brexit.</p> <p>Ben Gardiner, one of the authors of the Cambridge report, said previous reports had found that London was one of the worst affected due to its strong connections with the continent and dependence on finance and an international labour force.</p> <p>\u201cBut our analysis shows that London is one of the most resilient economies in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only has it increased its share of the UK\u2019s GDP over many years, gaining in importance, it has shown itself to be very resilient and robust with a young and flexible workforce that bounces back strongly from any upsets.\u201d</p> <p>That leaves the north-east and Midlands, which export more goods per head of population, to suffer the most from a no-deal Brexit.</p> <h2>Is there a silver lining?</h2> <p>There could be the Japan-ification of the UK economy. The report expects all parts of the UK economy to shrink over the next 12 years from trade and investment to employment and government revenues. But with the population also expected to fall significantly from current official projections, the number of people in the country needing jobs and government services will be lower, allowing for only marginal falls in GDP per head.</p> <p>In Japan, GDP has remained largely static for two decades and yet the population has remained largely satisfied. This follows a decline in the population that means GDP per head increases.</p> <p>Another silver lining could be that trade with other parts of the world takes off in defiance of current economic models. That is the basis of studies by the Economists for Brexit group, which have argued that UK firms, freed from stifling EU regulations, would find they can expand the number of export destinations for their goods and services. </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 may have hit a new peak, Wall Street may have recovered from Wednesday\u2019s losses but the mood was more downbeat in Europe. The strengthening euro after the more hawkish than expected minutes from the European Central Bank pushed a number of European markets into the red by the close of trading. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 14.43 points or 0.19% at 7762.94 Germany\u2019s Dax was down 0.59% at 13,202.90 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.29% lower at 5488.55 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.64% to 23,305.26 Spain\u2019s Ibex edged up 0.07% at 10,435.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.28% to 846.98 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 142 points or 0.56%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. One of the consequences of today\u2019s market moves is that Just Eat has overtaken Marks &amp; Spencer in market value. WIth its 4.7% rise Just Eat is now worth \u00a35.46bn. Marks on the other hand has fallen 7% to be valued at \u00a34.87bn. Another day, another record close for the FTSE 100. Despite a poor performance from key retailers following their updates - Marks &amp; Spencer is down 7% and Tesco off 4.5% - the leading index has added 0.19% to a new record of 7762.94. Earlier it recorded a new intraday peak of 7768.96. Commodity stocks were in demand following the rise in oil prices, while the biggest gainer was Just Eat, up nearly 5% as analysts at Barclays raised their price target from 700p to 1000p. Brent crude has climbed above $70 a barrel, a new three year high. Growing demand as the global economy strengthens and the effect of Opec and Russia\u2019s agreement to extend output caps continue to support the price. But it is bad news for motorists, who face an increase in petrol prices: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The euro rocketed higher this Thursday afternoon following a slightly more hawkish than expected set of ECB meeting minutes. While the end of QE isn\u2019t here just yet, there were a few notable shifts in the phrasing of the central bank\u2019s December accounts that suggest talk of winding down its massive bond buying programme is likely going to become more and more prevalent as 2018 continues. Of course the euro \u2013 which at the moment doesn\u2019t need much excuse to celebrate \u2013 was incredibly receptive to these signals. Here\u2019s the chief business economist at IHS Markit on the ECB minutes: The euro gained 0.9% to $1.2053 following the release of the ECB minutes, although it has now come off its best levels and is currently sitting at $1.1.2045. It is up around 5% against the pound at 88.9p. Earlier, a more hawkish tone from the minutes of the recent European Central Bank meeting gave some support to the euro. With the eurozone economy improving, the ECB minutes suggested policymakers might soon start preparing the markets for the end of its massive stimulus programme. The minutes said: The language pertaining to various dimensions of the monetary policy stance and forward guidance could be revisited early in [2018]. John Dolan, senior dealer at FEXCO Corporate Payments, said: The ECB\u2019s mood music has dramatically picked up the tempo. While this is far from a definitive announcement, it\u2019s a clear signal that monetary policy tightening has entered mainstream ECB thought. On this evidence, the end of loose monetary policy is coming, and coming faster than previously assumed. But despite the Eurozone\u2019s increasingly brisk growth rate, the ECB is still deeply concerned about inflation and the stubbornly low pace of wage rises. So for all the hawkish nods and winks in today\u2019s minutes, the QE money presses are still expected to keep turning until September. The euro has strengthened as markets adjust to this change of tone, and the stakes for Mario Draghi\u2019s next press conference have notched up as markets dare to hope that the ECB is finally ready to wean the Eurozone economy off monetary stimulus. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING believes there will be no abrupt end to QE: It is unsurprising that the ECB is not ignoring further steps in its tapering (or recalibration) process. Phrases [in the minutes] indicate a further adjustment but in our view no abrupt end. We stick to our previous view that the ECB will not stop QE in September but will rather decide on another \u201clower for longer\u201d beyond September, probably until the end of the year. Interestingly, the ECB is more and more focusing on growth and seems to regard inflation only as a derivative of growth developments. Judging from previous experiences, to get an inflation rate sustainably at around 2%, the Eurozone economy needs to have a positive output gap. This could, but does not necessarily have to, happen in the course of 2018. It is also obvious that the ECB\u2019s balancing act between uniting the Governing Council and not distorting markets on the rest of the way towards the exit is a difficult one. While the ECB had actually tried to hush speculation with the October decision for \u201clower for longer\u201d, some ECB officials\u2019 talks are clearly undermining this intention. In this regards, next week should be interesting when both Jens \u201cthe hawk\u201d Weidmann and Benoit \u201cfirst proponent now advocate for a September end\u201d Coeure will have public appearances. US stock markets have opened in positive territory, as concerns about the bond market eased (pace Bill Gross). Investors were put on edge on Wednesday after reports that China was planning to cut its buying of US Treasuries. A denial however seems to have calmed the nerves a little, for the moment at least. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: US stocks, Treasuries and the dollar all sold off [on Wednesday] on reports that China is considering cutting purchases of Treasuries. China is a huge buyer of US debt and so, should the reports turn out to be correct, one would expect yields on US debt to rise, which is why we saw such a knee jerk reaction. The report was later denied and even labelled fake news by China\u2019s FX regulator, which prompted an unwinding of the earlier moves, although investors appear to have remained on edge. Yields had already been rising in the 24 hours preceding the report after the Bank of Japan bought fewer 10-25 year and 25-40 year JGBs than it had been previously, prompting speculation that monetary stimulus is being withdrawn, despite the central bank having claimed only last month that tightening is not imminent. Despite any remaining jitters, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered 55 points or 0.23% ahead of a host of forthcoming trading updates. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.23% higher while the Nasdaq 100 is up 0.21%. Time for a quick recap, before Wall Street opens. Marks &amp; Spencer has been crowned as a Christmas loser, after reporting underwhelming sales figures. The high street chain suffered a 2.8% decline in clothing sales, while food - often a solid performer - shrank by 0.4%. Shares in M&amp;S have slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, down 6.5% right now, taking the Footsie away from a record high. Analysts say the figures show that M&amp;S is suffering from weak consumer confidence, and the growth of e-commerce. Tesco\u2019s shares have also been pummelled today, down 4%, even though it recorded a \u2018record\u2019 Christmas. Tesco grew sales by 1.9% over Christmas, which wasn\u2019t enough to meet City forecasts. But analysts are hopeful the CEO Dave Lewis\u2019s turnaround plan is working. Another street name, John Lewis, warned that its profits have been hit by inflation - even though sales were up year-on-year. Black Friday was a record, but that could actually have eroded John Lewis\u2019s profitability, thanks to its promise to never be knowingly undersold.... In other news.... Germany has posted its strongest annual growth in six years. Eurozone industrial production has surged, as Europe\u2019s recovery picks up Influential investor Bill Gross has warned that bonds, and men, are in a bear market It\u2019s getting harder to obtain credit in the UK, according to the Bank of England Newsflash: More Americans became unemployed last week than expected. The number of US citizens filing new claims for jobless benefit jumped by 11,000, to 261,000 - which is 10,000 more than expected. That suggests that US companies cut staff at the turn of the year, and might be a sign that the labor market is weakening. Or it could just be down to seasonal factors. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says: \u201cThe trend of rising US jobless claims looks to be gathering momentum into the early parts of 2018, with today\u2019s reading confirming a fourth rise in as many weeks. \u201cWhile the White House will need to address why such a traditionally robust labour market has begun to dwindle in recent months, there will be no reaching for the panic button just yet as labour market data during year-end holidays tends to be a little unpredictable. The severe cold snap can also be blamed for keeping people out of work. \u201cAny figures that remain under the 300,000 barrier will be viewed as positive, and President Trump can be comfortable for now knowing that the jobs market will likely remain tight for the foreseeable future.\u201d Spotted: The best reaction to Bill Gross\u2019s comments: An influential billionaire investor has warned that US government debt has entered a bear market -- just like your average man. In remarks that might cause a stir, Bill Gross of Janus has compared the US Treasury market to the recent torrent of revelations about unacceptable conduct by wealthy and powerful men. Bonds, like men, are falling in value and will continue to depreciate, Gross says in a new letter to his clients. He writes: Bonds, like men, are in a bear market. For both, it\u2019s hard to say when it all began. There was no Helen Reddy \u201cI Am Woman\u201d moment back in June 2012, and then again in July 2016 when the 10 year Treasury double-bottomed at 1.45%, but then in retrospect it should have been obvious that for bonds, like men \u2013 \u201ctheir time was up\u201d. Eighteen months ago, it was obvious to most observers that the economy, measured by nominal GDP, was not going to go much lower than 3% and that the Fed was having second thoughts about quantitative easing. Gross does \u2018concede\u2019 that men have some positive qualities - not losing the remote control (!) and starting wars (good for economic progress, don\u2019tcha know). But his serious point is that US bond prices rose much too high after the financial crisis, sending the yield (rate of return) to historically ultra-low levels. That process has started to reverse recently -- the US 10-year Treasury bond now yields 2.55% today, up from that 1.45% 18 months ago. Gross argues that the bear market will drive prices down, and yields up, during 2018. As he puts it: Oprah shouted, \u201cTheir time has come\u201d. The bear bond market\u2019s time has come as well. Many would say, including yours truly \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s about time\u201d. He\u2019s not the first to predict this. US bond yields have been creeping higher for months, as the US Federal Reserve continued to unwind its stimulus programme. Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts are another factor - they could push inflation higher, which is usually bad for bond prices. Gross has a reputation for \u2018colourful\u2019 commentary, and some observers aren\u2019t too impressed by today\u2019s effort: But.... Gross isn\u2019t actually criticising the #MeToo campaign, and he backs the idea of Oprah Winfrey could run for president. Indeed, he argues: Actually most of the world\u2019s problems would go away if men just stayed home, watched football and learned to talk to their partners during commercial breaks. There are certainly enough of them. Jewellery maker Pandora has added to the anxiety in the retail sector today by missing its sales targets for the last year. The news sent its shares spiralling down by over 10%, on track for their worst day in six years. Reuters has the details: Pandora missed its own 2017 sales forecasts on Thursday and warned of thinner margins ahead, putting shares in the world\u2019s largest jewellery maker on course for their worst day in more than six years. In a trading update, Pandora said it aims to generate around half of its revenue from rings, earrings and necklaces by 2022 and would increase its annual collections to 10 per year from seven. The Danish firm also aims to increase the share of its owned stores in a bid to gain larger share of revenue and better be able to control its brand. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time intraday high. The blue-chip index has risen to 7,764 points for the first time ever, up 15 points this morning, extending its recent rally. Online takeaway ordering app Just Eat is the top riser, up over 5% at 809p. That\u2019s because Barclays has just hiked its target for its shares to \u00a310, from 700p, in recognition of its blistering sales growth. But traditional retailers are having a tougher time. Marks &amp; Spencer is down almost 6%, while Tesco has lost 4.3% today. By my reckoning, that takes Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s value down to around \u00a35bn, while Just Eat is now worth nearly \u00a35.5bn. Quite remarkable. A business without any stores, that doesn\u2019t actually produce the food its customers eat, can be worth more than a company with over 900 UK stores and 30 million-plus customers. Hugh Fletcher, Global Head of Consultancy and Innovation at ecommerce consultancy Salmon, says \u2018forward-looking\u2019 UK retailers who embraced technology are now reaping the rewards. He writes: \u201cThe Christmas sales figures from retailers this week paints a varied picture of their success, with mixed sales performance across the industry. The retailers who have spent time investing and learning about omni-channel strategies are those that are starting to pull away from the less digitally literate ones, with the likes of Boohoo and Ted Baker revealing strong online sales for the Christmas period, with the latter reporting a huge 35% rise in online sales. The hard work of years of investment and organisational change is now visible, and with these stats there\u2019s no hiding for the digital laggards. Earlier this week Marks &amp; Spencer announced a major shake-up of its IT system; a sign that its previous technology efforts weren\u2019t really paying off. Over in Greece the statistics service has announced a further drop in unemployment - by far the country\u2019s biggest social ill. Helena Smith reports from Athens. From a record high of of almost 28% in September 2013, Greece\u2019s jobless rate dropped to 20.7% in October with Elstat, the country\u2019s statistics agency, putting the number of registered unemployed at 990.288 people. At the height of Athens\u2019 debt crisis five years ago more than 1.3 million Greeks were recorded as being out of work resulting in a massive exodus of well-trained professionals to wealthier European countries. But Greece\u2019s youth continue to pay a high price with the jobless rate among those under the age of 25 hovering at 40.8% - down from 44.4% a year ago. Greece has by far the highest unemployment rate in the euro zone - along with a debt pile that stands at around \u20ac320bn, also the highest in the EU. If budget projections are correct unemployment could fall to 18.4% this year, in a country whose economic output has dropped by around 26% since 2008. Take note, consumers and retailers. Lenders are making it harder to get credit. The Bank of England has just reported that the availability of unsecured credit to households decreased in the last three months of 2017 - the fourth quarterly decline in a row. That\u2019s because lenders took a tougher line when assessing applications, and are likely to keep tightening in 2018. The BoE says: Lenders expected a significant decrease in Q1 [January-March 2018]. Credit scoring criteria for granting total unsecured loan applications tightened again in Q4, and lenders expected them to tighten significantly further in Q1. The latest eurozone factory figures are out, and they\u2019re sparklingly good. Eurozone industrial production jumped by 1% during November, and was 3.2% higher than a year earlier. October\u2019s growth rate was also revised up, from 0.2% to 0.4%, further suggesting that manufacturers ended 2017 on a high. Most of Britain\u2019s major retailers have now reported financial results for the festive period. Tesco look like one of the winners (despite missing City forecasts), while M&amp;S are firmly in the losers camp after its clothing and food sales fell. We\u2019re keeping tabs on the sector here: Getting back to Britain\u2019s retailers, Martin Lane of money.co.uk says Tesco fought a good fight over Christmas, while M&amp;S struggled: \u201cTesco is still facing fierce competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl, but these results show they are still holding their ground. They can\u2019t afford to rest on their laurels though. With both Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons beating their Christmas trading forecasts, the supermarket giant needs to keep prices competitive despite inflation to keep customers loyal and coming back for more. \u201cThese positive results come in stark contrast to Marks and Spencer\u2019s who are suffering. Their signature luxury products are being undercut by bargain supermarkets at a fraction of the price. Shoppers expect quality and convenience for less than ever before, and M&amp;S simply aren\u2019t offering that at the moment.\u201d Breaking away from UK retailers, we have some strong economic data from Germany. The German economy expanded by 2.2% in 2017, the fastest rate since 2011. Once you adjust for working day changes, GDP actually rose by 2.5%. It\u2019s a stronger performance than many experts were predicting last year, when political risks threatened the German economy. Carsten Brzeski of ING says: Today\u2019s GDP data mark the end of a remarkable year for the German economy. A year ago, consensus forecasts for German growth were around 1.5% for 2017. Now, GDP growth is likely to come in at around 2.5%. How could the German (and the Eurozone) economy surprise so positively? A year ago, the German recovery already looked rather stretched. Sentiment indicators stagnated, with Brexit, the upcoming Dutch and French elections political risks had increased, and the new US administration had added possible trade wars into the growth equation of every forecaster. One year later the lesson is clear: \u201cit was not politics, but economics, stupid\u201d. Following a real Trump-spirit, the strong labour market, low interest rates and low inflation pushed the domestic economy into a sixth gear. Also, instead of suffering from protectionism or a Trump trade war, exports surged to new record highs and the long awaited investment pick-up finally kicked in. The result: the strongest annual growth performance since 2011. Yikes! Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer are now down 5% as the selloff gathers pace. Chief executive Steve Rowe has told journalists that Britain is suffering a spending squeeze. This means the UK consumer is \u201cquite fragile, quite volatile\u201d, Rowe adds (rather like M&amp;S\u2019s share price this morning...) Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics, says Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s financial results for the last three months paint a worrying picture: M&amp;S continues to struggle with the sheer pace of structural change reshaping the industry. The business model has come under increasing strain as the unforgiving shift towards online and the experience economy collide with inflexible leases, high rents and excess properties.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, isn\u2019t impressed either: \u2018This is a disappointing set of figures for M&amp;S, particularly in its food and online businesses. Sales in clothing and home actually fell by the biggest margin, but in a market which is shrinking, that\u2019s more a reflection of wider economic trends. In recent years the food business has been the bright light of the M&amp;S empire, but its glow has definitely dimmed of late. That\u2019s probably a result of consumers tightening their belts when it comes to grocery shopping, and the strong performance of supermarket premium ranges suggests when customers are splashing out, they are increasingly doing it at Sainsbury, Tesco and Morrison rather than at M&amp;S. Online sales growth at M&amp;S also looks pretty feeble when compared to the wider market. Steve Rowe\u2019s target of pushing digital sales at M&amp;S to one third of the total looks like a steep climb from here, and he\u2019ll be hoping a new deal to outsource 250 IT jobs to the Indian conglomerate Tata is part of the solution. It\u2019s still early days in the M&amp;S turnaround plan, however the risk is by the time M&amp;S gets up to speed, the rest of the pack might have disappeared out of sight.\u2019 Connor Campbell of SpreadEx is also concerned by the drop in food sales: While M&amp;S avoided a Debenhams-esque disaster, it was a long way from Next\u2019s surprisingly strong Xmas numbers. The perpetually unfashionable clothing and home business was, as ever, the headline casualty, posting a 2.8% plunge in like-for-like sales across the 13 weeks to the end of December \u2013 hardly a surprise given the division\u2019s head, Jo Jenkins, shockingly jumped ship in October. But, but, but, the clothing department is always a bit rubbish; how about the food business, ostensibly the company\u2019s shining star which, on paper, should have received a Christmas boost? Well once again the division under-performed expectations, suffering a 0.4% decline in comparable sales at the same time as its major supermarket rivals all saw some level of growth. Marks &amp; Spencer just can\u2019t shake its image as a sector dinosaur, with these results nipping a nascent rise in the bud as it fell 2.5% after the bell. Bryan Roberts, global insight director at tcc global, says Tesco\u2019s turnaround plan is on course. \u201cDespite many predictions that Tesco had \u2018won\u2019 Christmas, with that accolade instead being shared by Morrisons and the Co-op, the market leader nonetheless enjoyed a very creditable festive period. We were impressed by Tesco\u2019s seasonal ranging and merchandising across both food and general merchandise, backed up by solid availability and ongoing improvements in customer service and shopper experience. \u201cWhile a lot of attention in 2018 will be focused on the integration of Booker, we feel confident that the core supermarkets are in largely good shape.\u201d Retail analyst Steve Dresser agrees: Neil Wilson of ETX Capital points out that Tesco\u2019s food sales did well: \u201cLots to be positive about for Tesco as the Dave Lewis turnaround continues to yield results. Q3 was strong with like-for-like sales +2.3%, with a particularly good performance in Fresh Food, which grew by 3.7% in the UK. Stronger grocery and fresh food sales offset a less impressive performance in general merchandise and slower tobacco sales following the Palmer &amp; Harvey failure. But Naeem Aslam of Think Markets cautions that several rival supermarkets did better: Looking at competitors such as Sainsbury and Morrison, both have beaten their forecast for Christmas trading. This doesn\u2019t put Tesco in a strong position at all. The retailer which dominates the British High Street needs to make sure that it keeps its tools sharp to fight inflationary pressure by keeping the prices low. There is no doubt that Tesco has turned the corner and avoided a Debenhams style disaster but it needs to make sure that it stays on track to deliver on its medium-term ambition. This is mainly because the competition is fierce in this space and discounters such as Lidl and Aldi have performed extremely well. Lidl\u2019s Christmas sales increased by 16% and Aldi saw 15%. Amid the torrent of company news, small UK retailer Card Factory has slipped out a profits warning. It blames \u201ccontinue pressure\u201d on its profit margins, plus \u201cwage inflation\u201d and the inflationary pressure from the weak pound. Shares are down 21% in early trading! Here\u2019s my colleague Zoe Wood on today\u2019s retail sales figures: Tesco and John Lewis have emerged as winners from a tough Christmas trading period as Marks &amp; Spencer reported a downbeat set of figures with a slump in sales of both food and clothing. The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain reported like-for-like sales growth of 1.9% for its UK stores, a performance it said was thanks to the strength of its food business which saw underlying growth of 3.4%. At M&amp;S, the chief executive, Steve Rowe, admitted there had been a \u201cmixed\u201d performance. Its like-for-like clothing and homewares sales fell 2.8% while, despite inflation of about 3.7%, sales in its food halls were down 0.4%.... Here\u2019s her full story: DING DING! The London stock market is open...and retail shares are falling. Marks &amp; Spencer are down 2.4% in early trading, as traders react to its \u2018mixed\u2019 Christmas trading figures. Tesco are being thumped too, down 3.6% despite posting a rise in sales over the festive period. That confirms that the City had hoped for stronger figures from Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket. Tesco\u2019s Christmas trading figures were dented by the demise of wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey. Palmer &amp; Harvey, which supplied around 90,000 UK shops, collapsed in December with the loss of thousands of jobs. This left the supermarket giant struggling to get enough tobacco products on the shelves, and apparently knocked 0.5% off like-for-like sales growth [partly explaining why it missed City forecasts]. Tesco\u2019s CEO Dave Lewis says: Incorporating Palmer &amp; Harvey volumes and complexity during this peak period was challenging, resulting in lost tobacco sales across December and putting further strain into our distribution network, particularly post-Christmas. Whilst I am pleased to say these challenges have now been resolved, they took the shine off an otherwise outstanding performance for the period as a whole. Although Tesco is reporting a \u201crecord\u201d Christmas, its shares may actually drop when the stock market opens. That\u2019s because the City had expected an ever bigger jump in sales. Some analysts had expected growth of 2.4% or more, not the 1.9% which Tesco actually reported this morning. Elsewhere, online electrical goods vendor AO World has posted an 11% jump in revenues for the last three months of 2017. But the company also warns that the UK economic outlook remains uncertain. Online fashion retailer Boohoo.com had a good Christmas The company, which recently acquired PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, doubled its revenues in the last four months of 2017, in a \u201cin highly successful trading period\u201d. Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane, joint CEOs, say: \u201cWe are delighted to report another set of strong financial and operational results, with record sales in the four months to December across all our brands. The Black Friday period was our most successful ever and we traded well throughout the period under review. Ouch! House of Fraser has just reported some rather unimpressive figures - which won\u2019t calm fears over its future. Sales at House of Fraser sales shrank by 2.9% over the six-week Christmas period, a poor performance. It also says that the first week of the post-Christmas sales was \u201cdisappointing\u201d, although things have picked up since. Last week we learned that House of Fraser is pushing its landlords for a rent cut, and planning to downsize some of its stores. Onto John Lewis! They have just reported a 2.5% increase in gross sales over the Christmas period, with takings up at its department stores and Waitrose supermarkets. Black Friday was a particular highlight - boosting weekly sales by 7.2%. Sir Charlie Mayfield, Chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, says: \u2018We traded well during the Christmas period, with gross sales in the six weeks to 30 December \u00a31,962m, up 2.5% on last year, with 1.4% sales growth in Waitrose and 3.6% in John Lewis. This was due to the exceptional hard work and commitment of our Partners. We focused on our differentiated product offering, attention to service and strong value proposition, underpinned by our Never Knowingly Undersold promise. But Mayfield also warns that profits have been hit by rising inflation: The pressure on margin seen in the first half of the year has intensified because of our choice to maintain competitive prices, despite higher costs mainly due to the weaker exchange rate. This will negatively affect full-year financial results as indicated previously. Marks &amp; Spencer has less to celebrate this Christmas. Like-for-like sales in the UK fell by 1.4% in the last 13 weeks of 2017. Food sales dipped by 0.4% while clothing sales declined by 2.8%. Steve Rowe, Chief Executive says: \u201cM&amp;S had a mixed quarter with better Christmas trading in both businesses going some way to offset a weak clothing market in October and ongoing underperformance in our Food like-for-like sales. As a result, full year guidance remains unchanged.\u201d Tesco\u2019s sales figures in detail.... Boom! Supermarket giant Tesco says it has racked up its best ever Christmas. UK like-for-like sales over the festive period rose by 1.9%, including a 3.4% rise in food sales over the Christmas period. Tesco says it posted its \u201cbiggest ever sales week in the UK\u201d, thanks to a \u201cfresh food market outperformance of nearly 4%\u201d Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, is upbeat, saying Tesco is \u201cfirmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions.\u201d He says: \u201cWe have continued to outperform the market throughout this period, particularly in fresh food, thanks to our most competitive offer for many years. Our trading momentum accelerated across the third quarter and into December, with the four weeks leading up to Christmas Day delivering record sales and volumes in the UK. Retail analysts are impressed: Financial results are flashing across trading screens in the City.... Good morning. Today, a blizzard of Christmas trading updates will show how some of Britain\u2019s biggest retailers fared over the festive period. Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, House of Fraser and John Lewis all report results today. Online retailers AO World and Boohoo.com will all jostle for attention, as we try to separate the Christmas crackers from the turkeys. City analysts are expecting Tesco to do well, while Marks &amp; Spencer may have struggled (if only Meghan Markle had worn that \u00a345 M&amp;S jumper a little sooner...) In recent days we\u2019ve seen profit warnings from Debenhams, Mothercare and Moss Bros, but decent performances from Next and Sainsburys. It appears that companies selling food have performed better than non-food outlets, partly because food price inflation has pushed up turnover. Retailers who resisted slapping \u2018sale\u2019 stickers all over their stores have also been rewarded, as colleague Sarah Butler reported earlier this week: Kate Calvert, a retail analyst at Investec, said the different experiences of Debenhams and Next indicated that clothing chains which held back from early discounting may have fared better. That may potentially be good news for M&amp;S, which had fewer promotional days in 2017 than the year before, according to Calvert. But she still expects a \u201cmediocre\u201d performance from M&amp;S with clothing sales at established stores down by 3%. \u201cIt will be more like Next than Debenhams,\u201d she said. While retail specialists plough through these results, economists will be examining new UK credit stats, a healthcheck on Germany\u2019s economy, and the latest eurozone factory output data. European markets are expected to open a little higher. Last night, Wall Street fell after reports that Donald Trump will soon pull America out of the Nafta trade pact. Traders will also be watching the US bond market closely, after Treasuries suffered a sharp selloff yesterday. As the Financial Times explains: Is the three-decade bond bull market coming to a close? A fierce sell-off in the US bond market abated late on Wednesday but left yields on benchmark government debt at their highest level in nine months. There were signs of this last year but here\u2019s why the sell-off could be very different this time. The yield of 10-year Treasuries approached levels not seen since the \u201cTrumpflation\u201d retreat nearly a year ago, hitting a nine-month high of nearly 2.6 per cent on expectations that cash freed up by the recent US tax cut will finally help spark higher inflation driven by stronger economic growth.

Phrases [in the minutes] indicate a further adjustment but in our view no abrupt end.</p> <p>We stick to our previous view that the ECB will not stop QE in September but will rather decide on another \u201clower for longer\u201d beyond September, probably until the end of the year. Interestingly, the ECB is more and more focusing on growth and seems to regard inflation only as a derivative of growth developments. Judging from previous experiences, to get an inflation rate sustainably at around 2%, the Eurozone economy needs to have a positive output gap. This could, but does not necessarily have to, happen in the course of 2018.</p> <p>It is also obvious that the ECB\u2019s balancing act between uniting the Governing Council and not distorting markets on the rest of the way towards the exit is a difficult one. While the ECB had actually tried to hush speculation with the October decision for \u201clower for longer\u201d, some ECB officials\u2019 talks are clearly undermining this intention. In this regards, next week should be interesting when both Jens \u201cthe hawk\u201d Weidmann and Benoit \u201cfirst proponent now advocate for a September end\u201d Coeure will have public appearances. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/951433346235715584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There you go!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ECB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ECB</a>: &#39;Could consider gradual shift in guidance from early 2018&#39;! <a href=\"https://t.co/M8jUTqCOHX\">pic.twitter.com/M8jUTqCOHX</a></p>&mdash; jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/951433346235715584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 11, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-11T14:58:15.538Z\">at 2.58pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a57754de4b043ead794d033\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-11T14:41:43.807Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US stock markets have opened in positive territory, as concerns about the bond market eased (pace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/11/christmas-tesco-marks-and-spencer-john-lewis-retail-stock-markets?page=with:block-5a576176e4b043ead794cf78#block-5a576176e4b043ead794cf78\">Bill Gross</a>).</p> <p>Investors were put on edge on Wednesday after reports that China was planning to cut its buying of US Treasuries.

Steve Rowe\u2019s target of pushing digital sales at M&amp;S to one third of the total looks like a steep climb from here, and he\u2019ll be hoping a new deal to outsource 250 IT jobs to the Indian conglomerate Tata is part of the solution.</p> <p>It\u2019s still early days in the M&amp;S turnaround plan, however the risk is by the time M&amp;S gets up to speed, the rest of the pack might have disappeared out of sight.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Connor Campbell of SpreadEx is also concerned by the drop in food sales:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While M&amp;S avoided a Debenhams-esque disaster, it was a long way from Next\u2019s surprisingly strong Xmas numbers.

Well once again the division under-performed expectations, suffering a 0.4% decline in comparable sales at the same time as its major supermarket rivals all saw some level of growth.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer just can\u2019t shake its image as a sector dinosaur, with these results nipping a nascent rise in the bud as it fell 2.5% after the bell.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a5721d5e4b043ead794cd23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-11T08:40:31.718Z\">8.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a571f3de4b034b6630d31bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-11T08:33:12.956Z\">8.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tesco: What the experts say</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <strong>Bryan Roberts</strong>, global insight director at <strong>tcc global</strong>, says Tesco\u2019s turnaround plan is on course.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cDespite many predictions that Tesco had \u2018won\u2019 Christmas, with that accolade instead being shared by Morrisons and the Co-op, the market leader nonetheless enjoyed a very creditable festive period.

      "bodyText": "Ocado is to test a humanoid maintenance assistant in its warehouses, in the online grocery specialist\u2019s latest move to reduce reliance on human workers. The SecondHands robot prototype, which resembles a cousin of Star Wars\u2019 C3P0 with a wheeled platform instead of legs, is designed to assist engineers looking after the company\u2019s handling systems. The aim is to use artificial intelligence to predict the technician\u2019s needs and hand them tools or move ladders or bolts. The robot and its operational software, including speech recognition, were developed at the Institute for Anthropomatics and Robotics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), in southern Germany. Ocado is also working with researchers at University College London, the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne and Sapienza University in Rome on systems that can recognise and interpret human actions and decide how to help. Graham Deacon, robotics research team leader at Ocado, said the aim was to develop a robot that could help without prompting in \u201ca fluid and natural interaction between robot and technician\u201d. Ocado, which delivers groceries for Waitrose and Morrisons, has invested millions of pounds in developing technology to manage home deliveries for global grocery retailers. In November, it signed its first big international contract to develop a robotic warehouse for the French supermarket Groupe Casino. Its newest warehouse in Andover, Hampshire, uses hundreds of battery-powered robots to shift boxes of groceries stored in a giant grid. The group is also developing packing robots that can grasp many types of products, from potentially dangerous bottles of bleach to fragile avocados and eggs. Retailers have used automated warehouse systems for years but the involvement of robots is expected to step up dramatically as technology gets smarter and labour costs rise. Last year, a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers said more than 10 million workers in the UK were at risk of having their jobs rendered obsolete by automation in the next 15 years, About 2.25 million of them work in retail and distribution. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The crucial Christmas trading season can be make or break for retailers. As the festive season got under way, companies faced intense competition to win sales as cash-strapped consumers constrained by falling real pay sought out the best deals. It was tough for the whole retail market but, with most of the major retailers having now reported, more winners have emerged than losers. Winners Tesco The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain is one of the winners even though its sales performance fell short of some City expectations. It reported like-for-like sales growth of 1.9% for its UK stores, a performance it said was thanks to the strength of its food business which saw underlying growth of 3.4%. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, was upbeat, saying Tesco is \u201cfirmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions.\u201d John Lewis Underlying sales at John Lewis department stores rose 3.1% over the six weeks to 30 December. Its sister chain Waitrose enjoyed growth of 1.5% on a like-for-like basis. Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said the group had traded well but the widespread discounting in the market had hurt profits as its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d pledge forced it to match rivals prices. Sainsbury\u2019s The UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket benefited from its merger with Argos, despite experiencing \u201cchallenging conditions\u201d. The company upgraded profit expectations by about 5%, saying it had been able to make cost savings from its tie-up with the retail chain earlier than expected. Sales at established stores rose by 1.1% in the 15 weeks to 6 January, in line with consensus. The company said Argos had gained market share, despite a 1.4% fall in sales almost entirely due to the closure of dozens of outlets of the DIY chain Homebase, as a result of the change in ownership. Sainsbury\u2019s increased grocery sales by 2.3%, partly as a result of inflation, and there was an 8.2% surge in sales at the group\u2019s convenience stores and a 7.3% rise online. Next The fashion and homeware chain kicked off the festive reporting season in style, beating forecasts by reporting a surprise rise in sales. Next received a last-minute boost from the the colder weather in the run-up to Christmas, which helped the retailer achieve a 1.5% increase in total sales in the 54 days to 24 December. It was much better than the 0.3% fall that City analysts had predicted, and prompted Next to upgrade its profit expectations for the year to January. Morrisons The UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket chain was a Christmas hit with bargain-hunting shoppers, after it said it had held the price of a basket of key festive items at the same level as the previous year, despite the rising cost of many commodities. Morrisons said it had improved customer service by opening more tills and improving stock availability, while shoppers snapped up premium foods, children\u2019s clothes and bags of vegetables. Sales rose by 2.8% in the 10 weeks to 7 January, well ahead of the 1.7% expected by analysts. AO World Internet retailers have also done well. Online electrical retailer AO said it was \u201con track\u201d as it posted UK revenue growth of 11.4% in the three months to 31 December. Revenues in its Europe business jumped nearly 60% excluding currency effects, and overall group revenues advanced 16.6%. Even so, AO, which sells domestic appliances and electronic products in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands, remained \u201ccautious given the uncertain UK economic outlook\u201d. Boohoo The online fashion retailer had its best Black Friday period ever and said its PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands, acquired in late 2016 and early 2017 respectively, were faring well. Overall revenues doubled to \u00a3228.2m, with Boohoo up 25% to \u00a3142.6m in the four months to 31 December \u2013 slightly worse than expected. But PrettyLittleThing beat expectations with a 191% surge in revenues to \u00a373.8m and Nasty Gal made \u00a311.9m. The retailer raised its forecast for full-year group revenue growth to 90% from 80%. Joules The recently floated clothing chain popular with middle-class women and known for its bright floral prints and pink wellies enjoyed a bumper Christmas. Sales jumped 19.2% in the seven weeks to 7 January, compared with the same period a year earlier. Joules said sales had grown both in its chain of shops and online, with the chief executive, Colin Porter, putting the success down to the \u201cstrength of the Joules brand, unique product proposition and customer engagement\u201d. The company, which has 118 UK stores, said gross retail margins were unchanged over the festive period because it took \u201ca selective approach to promotional activity\u201d. Fat Face The casual clothing retailer was another festive winner, revealing a 12% increase in total sales in the five weeks to January. Fat Face said its decision not to go down the pre-Christmas discounting route was crucial to its success. \u201cWe continue to believe that giving our customers price integrity before the big day has been central to this performance,\u201d said Anthony Thompson, chief executive. Like-for-like sales over the five weeks rose 8%, and it had its best ever week of sales in the week ending 30 December. Oxfam Vintage designer clothing and first-edition books helped drive a sharp rise in online sales at Oxfam over Christmas. They jumped by one-third in the eight weeks to 23 December, increasing total sales by 1.2% to \u00a316.9m. The charity store chain also more than doubled sales of its ethical Sourced by Oxfam gifts. Losers Marks &amp; Spencer Marks &amp; Spencer reported a downbeat set of figures with a slump in sales of both food and clothing. Chief executive Steve Rowe admitted there had been a \u201cmixed\u201d performance. Like-for-like clothing and homewares sales at the highstreet stalwart fell 2.8% while, despite inflation of about 3.7%, sales in its food halls were down 0.4%. House of Fraser Another loser, House of Fraser said sales in its stores fell 2.9% in the six weeks to 23 December. Its internet sales were also down 7.5%. Its chief executive Alex Williamson said it had pulled back from discounting to shore up profits. Last week it emerged that the department store chain is pushing its landlords for a rent cut, and planning to downsize some of its stores. Card Factory The greeting card retailer warned on profits, despite \u201csolid\u201d like-for-like sales growth of 2.7% in the 11 months to 31 December. The FTSE 250 firm, which opened 48 new UK stores during the period, is now expecting underlying profits for the year to come in between \u00a393m and \u00a395m. This is less than the \u00a397m expected by analysts and last year\u2019s profits of \u00a398.5m. Card Factory blamed the weaker pound and wage inflation as well as a bigger sales proportion of less profitable non-card products, which will result in extra costs of \u00a37m to \u00a38m. Signet Jewelers Another loser, the company posted a 5.3% decline in same-store sales to $1.9bn (\u00a31.4bn) for the nine weeks to 30 December. Sales at its H. Samuel and Ernest Jones chains in the UK dropped more than 10% on the same basis, with bridal and diamond fashion jewellery struggling, although luxury watches and online sales fared better. Debenhams The first big shock of the Christmas reporting season came from Debenhams last week, which brought its festive update forward by a week to issue a profits warning. The department store chain said sales of seasonal gifts and clothing had fallen, despite heavy discounting. Sales fell by 2.6% at Debenhams\u2019 established UK stores, open for more than a year, in the 17 weeks to 30 December. Shares fell by 15% after the retailer warned full-year profits would come in between \u00a355m and \u00a365m \u2013 sharply below City expectations of \u00a383m. Mothercare The baby and maternity products chain was another festive loser, after its decision to hold off from discounting in the run-up to Christmas failed to pay off. Mothercare was forced to issue a profits warning after like-for-like sales fell by 7.2% over the 12 weeks to 30 December. The retailer said pre-tax profits in the full year to the end of March were likely to be somewhere between \u00a31m and \u00a35m \u2013 well below City expectations of \u00a310m and a far cry from the \u00a319.7m achieved a year earlier. Shares plunged by more than 30% to an all-time low of 42p. Moss Bros The men\u2019s outfitter warned that profits would be slightly lower than expected, blaming lower shopper numbers in its stores. Like-for-like store sales slumped 8% in December in what the company described as \u201ca very challenging backdrop\u201d. It said consumer demand was weaker while it faced \u201ccost headwinds\u201d. Total retail sales rose 1.6% in the 23 weeks to 6 January, helped by a 12.3% rise online. It said profits for the year to the end of January would be between \u00a36.5m and \u00a36.8m, which it said was slightly below analysts\u2019 expectations. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

This means that some companies include new extensions to stores in their like-for-like sales, while others include sales generated by a customer paying with a voucher. Critics of the measure say that like-for-like sales do not always give an accurate picture of a retailer\u2019s health.

      "bodyText": "Three of the UK\u2019s biggest retailers have delivered disappointing Christmas figures as weak consumer confidence and ferocious online competition take their toll on the high street. Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Tesco reported their Christmas sales on what had been billed as Super Thursday in the City, but it proved to be a flop with investors. M&amp;S and Tesco ended the day as the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 index with more than \u00a31bn collectively wiped off the value of their shares. Retailers are trapped in a profit squeeze as the devaluation of sterling pushes up the cost of sourcing products at a time when shoppers\u2019 spending power is under pressure and they are making fewer trips to the shops and scouring the internet for the best deals. \u201cSuper Thursday turned out to be the day of disappointments,\u201d said Whitman Howard analyst Tony Shiret. M&amp;S reported a sales slump in clothing and food as a series of own goals, including a misfiring website and high food prices, compounded tough market conditions. At Tesco, although its supermarkets chalked up underlying growth of 1.9% over the key Christmas weeks, the City complained it had not delivered the \u201cslam dunk\u201d expected. M&amp;S\u2019s chief executive, Steve Rowe, revealed the store had been forced to remove products such as wrapping paper and Christmas cards from its website after operational issues at its high-tech warehouse in Castle Donington meant it was unable to deliver them to customers in time. Clothing and homewares sales slumped 2.9%, while food sales fell 0.4%. Its website trailed rivals with growth of 3%. There were also issues in M&amp;S\u2019s upmarket food halls as shoppers headed there for organic turkey, with sales up 42%, but not for the trimmings. The chain was also caught up in a brussels sprout price war after rivals slashed the cost of the Christmas staple, making M&amp;S\u2019s offering look expensive. \u201cWe have more to do in some of the commodity items where there really is a battle on price,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cWe have not been sharp enough there. The consumer is quite fragile and volatile, if you give them a reason not to spend they\u2019ll take it.\u201d Employee-owned department store John Lewis fared better, with sales breaking through \u00a31bn for the first time during the six-week Christmas period. But sales were hard won, with the John Lewis Partnership, which also owns Waitrose, warning that profits would be down this year after it matched the blizzard of price cuts that began on Black Friday. John Lewis\u2019s \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d pledge means it has no choice but to take part in events like Black Friday, even if they dent profits. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t exist, I wouldn\u2019t invent it, but it\u2019s here, and it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d said John Lewis managing director Paula Nickolds. John Lewis slashed its staff bonus for the fourth year running in 2017, reducing it to 6% of pay \u2013 the lowest payout since 1954. With profits under pressure again this year, analysts suggested the staff bonus could be in the firing line again. M&amp;S\u2019s weak food sales handed it the wooden spoon for Christmas 2017 as arch-rival Waitrose enjoyed growth of 1.5% thanks to hit products such as chocolate and ginger mince pies and citrus sherbert lazy gin created by celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal. The major stock market-listed chains enjoyed mixed fortunes over Christmas 2017, with strong online sales helping Next deliver better-than-expected figures, while mid-market rival Debenhams fired off a profit warning. Other casualties included Mothercare, Moss Bros, and House of Fraser, where underlying sales fell 2.9%. Even Card Factory found the going tough as shoppers skimped on Christmas cards. Online fashion retailer Boohoo is among the few standout successes, with sales doubling over Christmas as its fashion-hungry shoppers snapped up inexpensive party outfits. Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: \u201cThere are Christmas winners and losers every year, and the slew of trading updates we\u2019ve seen in the past 10 days shows that 2017 was no different. Despite rising prices, shoppers managed to find a way to treat themselves to more mince pies and craft gins than ever before. \u201cWhile most of the figures we have seen are flattered by inflation, the grocers have proven that consumers will spend where the offering is right. Non-food stores were not so fortunate. A cold snap just before Christmas boosted some fashion retailers, but sales of toys and jewellery were disappointing across the board.\u201d Earlier this week, Theo Paphitis, the owner of Ryman and Robert Dyas and a former judge on the BBC\u2019s Dragons\u2019 Den show, said trading conditions were the toughest he had faced: \u201cIn all my years I have never seen it so hard and unforgiving where the shopper will punish you if you take your eye off the ball.\u201d Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, insisted the store had delivered a phenomenal performance despite the City\u2019s negative reception. Its food sales were strong, but household goods did less well, with sales of TVs, home computers and DVDs in decline. Some analysts were also critical of the weaker-than-expected performance delivered by its website and Express convenience stores. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here",

      "bodyText": "Whether it\u2019s over pints of warm ale in a mocked-up canal-side pub or flutes of champagne on the bow of brand new 76ft (23-metre) luxury yachts, the London Boat Show\u2019s organisers were raising a glass to Brexit on Wednesday. The collapse in the value of the pound since the referendum vote in June 2016 has fuelled a boom in British boat building as the vast majority of UK-built yachts are sold overseas. Boats and equipment sales totalled \u00a33.1bn last year \u2013 a 3.4% increase on 2016 and the best year since before the 2008 financial crisis, when rich people\u2019s appetite for new yachts evaporated. \u201cWe suddenly became 15 to 20% cheaper than our competitors in Europe and the US [after Brexit],\u201d said Russell Currie, managing director of Fairline Yachts, at the opening of the London Boat Show at ExCel in east London. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic year.\u201d Currie said 95% of the company\u2019s yachts, the biggest of which sell for several million pounds, are exported so the collapse in the pound has made its vessels better value compared to European and US rivals. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that only 5% of owners are British,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of them are British but they are buying them in a sunnier climate than ours.\u201d Brexit has helped Fairline recover from collapsing into administration two years ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from zero employees, with zero contracts and zero dealers in January 2016 to more than 380 employees, and a full order book,\u201d Currie said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sold 162 boats in the last two years ... no, 163, we sold one this morning.\u201d Currie explained that Fairline\u2019s customers, who he said are generally very rich with self-made wealth, are increasingly demanding bigger boats, which had created a headache for the company which is based in landlocked Oundle, Northamptonshire. At present Fairline\u2019s boats are transported to the sea by lorry in the middle of the night, but doing so has limited the maximum size of its yachts to 78ft. \u201cOur Oundle base is nowhere near the sea, and the cost [of transporting boats to the sea] has compromised the size and design of our boats,\u201d Currie said. \u201cSo, we have invested \u00a330m in a shore-side manufacturing facility on Southampton Water.\u201d The company will hire about 200 new workers in Southampton. The new base will allow the company to match its customers\u2019 growing demand for roomier boats. \u201cWe have made 115 78ft boats, and 80 65ft boats, that gives you an indication of the appetite \u2013 they want bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cBuying our boats is how our customers reward themselves for the success they have achieved.\u201d Currie said the company\u2019s customers tend not to be too ostentatious, but have been been known to buy \u201cseven, eight, nine or 10 Fairlines \u2013 but not all at the same time\u201d. He said the company\u2019s strategy is to encourage owners to start small and then upgrade to bigger models as they get more experienced with yachting, and their bank balance grows. \u201cThey want to bring their families and enjoy their free time,\u201d Currie said of his customers. \u201cThey tend to be very family-orientated , they want to enjoy their wealth rather than show their wealth.\u201d Even Fairline\u2019s Russian owners Alexander Volov and Igor Glyanenko, who bought the company out of administration for \u00a34m in 2016, do not own the brand\u2019s biggest boat. \u201cOne owns a 42ft boat the other a 62ft,\u201d Currie said. \u201cThese are conservative guys. These are very hard-working business guys \u2013 this is not an oligarch story.\u201d Sales are so strong at Poole-based Sunseeker International that the now-Chinese owned company is splashing cash on sponsoring the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia, which will allow the company to invite a selection of its super-rich customers to the tournament. Phil Popham, chief executive of Sunseeker International, said Brexit had helped fuel \u201cvery, very strong growth\u201d and he expected 2017 sales will have increased by at least 10% on 2016. The company collected revenue of \u00a3252m in 2016, an increase of 26% on 2014. \u201cWe sold 140 yachts last year, and we expect to sell a lot more than that this year,\u201d he said, on the bow of a newly launched 76ft model. \u201cWe\u2019ve sold 90% of our production for 2018 already on forward order.\u201d For some larger models customers will have to wait until 2020 for delivery if they order now. Popham said demand is strongest for superyacht-sized models, including the largest 131ft Sunseeker, which costs \u00a316m plus tax. \u201cIt takes 10-12 guests and requires seven crew, it really is a superyacht,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sold 125 boats over 100ft since 2002.\u201d Sunseeker is now the world\u2019s largest producer of yachts over 85ft, turning out about 30 a year. While Brexit has helped make Sunseekers more price competitive, Popham said cost was not the primary motivator of his customers. \u201cThis [he said tapping the yacht] is a discretionary purchase, no one needs a superyacht. \u201cThe world is becoming more and more affluent. There are more ultra-high net-worth individuals than ever before, we see that trend continuing and that is clearly our target market.\u201d Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "body": "<p>Whether it\u2019s over pints of warm ale in a mocked-up canal-side pub or flutes of champagne on the bow of brand new 76ft (23-metre) luxury yachts, the London Boat Show\u2019s organisers were raising a glass to Brexit on Wednesday. </p> <p>The collapse in the value of the pound since the referendum vote in June 2016 has fuelled a boom in British boat building as the vast majority of UK-built yachts are sold overseas. Boats and equipment sales totalled \u00a33.1bn last year \u2013 a 3.4% increase on 2016 and the best year since before the 2008 financial crisis, when rich people\u2019s appetite for new yachts evaporated. </p> <p>\u201cWe suddenly became 15 to 20% cheaper than our competitors in Europe and the US [after Brexit],\u201d said Russell Currie, managing director of Fairline Yachts, at the opening of the London Boat Show at ExCel in east London. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic year.\u201d</p> <p>Currie said 95% of the company\u2019s yachts, the biggest of which sell for several million pounds, are exported so the collapse in the pound has made its vessels better value compared to European and US rivals. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that only 5% of owners are British,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of them are British but they are buying them in a sunnier climate than ours.\u201d </p> <p>Brexit has helped Fairline recover from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/02/yacht-maker-fairline-administration-450-jobs-risk\">collapsing into administration two years ago</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from zero employees, with zero contracts and zero dealers in January 2016 to more than 380 employees, and a full order book,\u201d Currie said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sold 162 boats in the last two years ... no, 163, we sold one this morning.\u201d</p> <p>Currie explained that Fairline\u2019s customers, who he said are generally very rich with self-made wealth, are increasingly demanding bigger boats, which had created a headache for the company which is based in landlocked Oundle, Northamptonshire. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e450cce062cbf4fd229d26ecc709f53013c931a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e450cce062cbf4fd229d26ecc709f53013c931a2/0_58_5430_3258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside a Fairline Squadron 53 boat at the London Boat Show, but the company is facing increasing demand for larger models.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside a Fairline Squadron 53 boat at the London Boat Show, but the company is facing increasing demand for larger models.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At present Fairline\u2019s boats are transported to the sea by lorry in the middle of the night, but doing so has limited the maximum size of its yachts to 78ft. </p> <p>\u201cOur Oundle base is nowhere near the sea, and the cost [of transporting boats to the sea] has compromised the size and design of our boats,\u201d Currie said. \u201cSo, we have invested \u00a330m in a shore-side manufacturing facility on Southampton Water.\u201d The company will hire about 200 new workers in Southampton. </p> <p>The new base will allow the company to match its customers\u2019 growing demand for roomier boats. \u201cWe have made 115 78ft boats, and 80 65ft boats, that gives you an indication of the appetite \u2013 they want bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cBuying our boats is how our customers reward themselves for the success they have achieved.\u201d</p> <p>Currie said the company\u2019s customers tend not to be too ostentatious, but have been been known to buy \u201cseven, eight, nine or 10 Fairlines \u2013 but not all at the same time\u201d. He said the company\u2019s strategy is to encourage owners to start small and then upgrade to bigger models as they get more experienced with yachting, and their bank balance grows. </p> <p>\u201cThey want to bring their families and enjoy their free time,\u201d Currie said of his customers. \u201cThey tend to be very family-orientated , they want to enjoy their wealth rather than show their wealth.\u201d</p> <p>Even Fairline\u2019s Russian owners Alexander Volov and Igor Glyanenko, who bought the company out of administration for \u00a34m in 2016, do not own the brand\u2019s biggest boat. \u201cOne owns a 42ft boat the other a 62ft,\u201d Currie said. \u201cThese are conservative guys.
