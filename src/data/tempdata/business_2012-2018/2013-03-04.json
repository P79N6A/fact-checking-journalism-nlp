    "webTitle": "200 HSBC staff paid more than \u00a31m in 2012", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC paid 204 of its staff more than \u00a31m in 2012, a year when Britain's biggest bank made profits of $20.6bn (\u00a313.7bn) despite being fined \u00a31.2bn by the US authorities for helping Mexican drug barons launder money through the financial system. At the start of a week in which Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland are both expected to publish the pay of their highest earners for the first time, HSBC disclosed that 78 of those who took home more than \u00a31m were based in the UK. Britain's biggest union, Unite, described the scale of the pay as an \"outrage\" given that some of its members at HSBC take home \u00a314,000 a year and are facing changes to their pension schemes and holidays. The bank paid $200m of corporation tax in the UK on the profits, which were lower than the City expected, causing the shares to fall 2.5% to 710p. The 2012 profits were down 6% on 2011 and included $5.2bn caused by accounting rules requiring the bank to take account of the cost of buying back its own debt. HSBC is lobbying for these rules to be changed and stressed underlying profits were up 18% at $16.4bn after making $1bn losses in the UK and $2.5bn of losses in the US. It could yet be fined for rigging Libor but said there was \"high degree of uncertainty\" about ongoing investigations. \"The potential impact and size of any fines\" cannot be measured, the bank said. HSBC, whose $1bn of UK losses were partly due to $2.3bn charges for misselling payment protection insurance and interest swaps, part of the US fine as well as the bank levy, makes a number of disclosures on pay. Banks are not required to disclose how many of their staff take home over \u00a31m but HSBC has provided the number in recent years with out publishing the information in its annual report. To comply with UK rules HSBC said its eight highest paid staff reporting to the chief executive were handed between \u00a32.3m and \u00a37m, totalling just over \u00a328m. Under Hong Kong rules its five highest paid staff received between \u00a33.9m and \u00a37.5m, and \u00a327.8m in total. Bonuses worth just $700,000 were clawed back from staff, according to a separate disclosure required to comply with international regulations which also showed that HSBC paid its 314 \"code staff\" \u2013 takers and spotters of risk \u2013 a total of $384.3m, an average of $1.2m.All employees are subject to a \"values\" test before being handed any payout, which the bank described as a \"gating item\". HSBC's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, was awarded a near \u00a32m annual bonus for his \"strong leadership\" and \"personal behaviour\" in tackling the revelations that led to the US fine. The bank produced a number of methods for disclosing his pay, including one total of \u00a38.9m \u2013 which included his \u00a31.2m salary and benefits of \u00a31.2m as well as \u00a35.6m of bonuses which will be released to him next week from previous years and \u00a3780,000 of the \u00a32m bonus he was awarded for 2012 which he received during the year. If the full \u00a32m bonus is included \u2013 some of it is deferred for five years and subject to clawback \u2013 his take home pay rises to \u00a310m. This does not include \u00a33m of shares awarded to him for 2012 nor \u00a34.1m of pay plans from prior years which vested during 2012. Gulliver, who has been leading an effort to improve returns for shareholders and urged staff to demonstrate \"courageous integrity\", has closed or disposed of 26 businesses in 2012 and axed 27,700 jobs in the process, leaving the workforce at 270,000. In total 47 business have been axed since he was promoted from running the investment bank at the start of 2011. The bonus pool took account of the US fine, although the investment bank bonuses were up slightly on 2011 at $1.3bn \u2013 although down across the group at $3.7bn. More bonuses could be clawed back during 2013, potentially including that paid to Sandy Flockhart, who retired with ill health in 2012 and used to run the Mexican business. Flockhart took home \u00a3782,000 in 2012 and is allowed to keep shares from bonus plans handed to him in the past. In 2012 these paid out \u00a34.2m. HSBC used $8.3bn to pay dividends to shareholders and took the unusual step of revealing that three interim dividends for 2013 will be up 11% at $0.10 per share. Chairman Douglas Flint, who took home \u00a33.7m last year, said the US fine had been \"extremely damaging to HSBC's reputation\". The bank had already \"apologised unreservedly\" for the incident in its US and Mexican operations, he said. The UK's government bank levy cost HBSC $571m, just under half of which was on its balance sheet outside the UK, which Flint said knocked $0.03 off the bank's dividend, which stood at $0.45 per share for 2012. Another measure of return \u2013 which measures the difference between the return on capital deployed by shareholders and the cost of that capital \u2013 showed that the bank made an \"economic loss\" of $5.1bn. The directors were penalised for failing to meet their targets for return on equity of up to 15% by reporting 8.4% but received bonuses based on the capital strength as the crucial core tier one ratio was 12.3% above the 10% target.",

      "body": "<p>HSBC paid 204 of its staff more than \u00a31m in 2012, a year when Britain's biggest bank made profits of $20.6bn (\u00a313.7bn) despite being fined \u00a31.2bn by the US authorities for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-bank-us-money-laundering\" title=\"\">helping Mexican drug barons</a> launder money through the financial system.</p> <p>At the start of a week in which Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland are both expected to publish the pay of their highest earners for the first time, HSBC disclosed that 78 of those who took home more than \u00a31m were based in the UK.</p> <p>Britain's biggest union, Unite, described the scale of the pay as an \"outrage\" given that some of its members at HSBC take home \u00a314,000 a year and are facing changes to their pension schemes and holidays.</p> <p>The bank paid $200m of corporation tax in the UK on the profits, which were lower than the City expected, causing the shares to fall 2.5% to 710p.</p> <p>The 2012 profits were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/27/hsbc-170-staff-million-dollar-pay\" title=\"\">down 6% on 2011</a> and included $5.2bn caused by accounting rules requiring the bank to take account of the cost of buying back its own debt. HSBC is lobbying for these rules to be changed and stressed underlying profits were up 18% at $16.4bn after making $1bn losses in the UK and $2.5bn of losses in the US.</p> <p>It could yet be fined for rigging Libor but said there was \"high degree of uncertainty\" about ongoing investigations. \"The potential impact and size of any fines\" cannot be measured, the bank said.</p> <p>HSBC, whose $1bn of UK losses were partly due to $2.3bn charges for misselling payment protection insurance and interest swaps, part of the US fine as well as the bank levy, makes a number of disclosures on pay. Banks are not required to disclose how many of their staff take home over \u00a31m but HSBC has provided the number in recent years with out publishing the information in its annual report.</p> <p>To comply with UK rules HSBC said its eight highest paid staff reporting to the chief executive were handed between \u00a32.3m and \u00a37m, totalling just over \u00a328m. Under Hong Kong rules its five highest paid staff received between \u00a33.9m and \u00a37.5m, and \u00a327.8m in total.</p> <p>Bonuses worth just $700,000 were clawed back from staff, according to a separate disclosure required to comply with international regulations which also showed that HSBC paid its 314 \"code staff\" \u2013 takers and spotters of risk \u2013 a total of $384.3m, an average of $1.2m.All employees are subject to a \"values\" test before being handed any payout, which the bank described as a \"gating item\".</p> <p>HSBC's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, was awarded a near \u00a32m annual bonus for his \"strong leadership\" and \"personal behaviour\" in tackling the revelations that led to the US fine. The bank produced<a href=\"http://www.img.ghq.hsbc.com/1/2/investor-relations/financial-info/pillar-3\" title=\"\"> a number of methods for</a> disclosing his pay, including one total of \u00a38.9m \u2013 which included his \u00a31.2m salary and benefits of \u00a31.2m as well as \u00a35.6m of bonuses which will be released to him next week from previous years and \u00a3780,000 of the \u00a32m bonus he was awarded for 2012 which he received during the year. If the full \u00a32m bonus is included \u2013 some of it is deferred for five years and subject to clawback \u2013 his take home pay rises to \u00a310m. This does not include \u00a33m of shares awarded to him for 2012 nor \u00a34.1m of pay plans from prior years which vested during 2012.</p> <p>Gulliver, who has been leading an effort to improve returns for shareholders and urged staff to demonstrate \"courageous integrity\", has closed or disposed of 26 businesses in 2012 and axed 27,700 jobs in the process, leaving the workforce at 270,000. In total 47 business have been axed since he was promoted from running the investment bank at the start of 2011.</p> <p>The bonus pool took account of the US fine, although the investment bank bonuses were up slightly on 2011 at $1.3bn \u2013 although down across the group at $3.7bn. More bonuses could be clawed back during 2013, potentially including that paid to Sandy Flockhart, who retired with ill health in 2012 and used to run the Mexican business. Flockhart took home \u00a3782,000 in 2012 and is allowed to keep shares from bonus plans handed to him in the past. In 2012 these paid out \u00a34.2m.</p> <p>HSBC used $8.3bn to pay dividends to shareholders and took the unusual step of revealing that three interim dividends for 2013 will be up 11% at $0.10 per share.</p> <p>Chairman Douglas Flint, who took home \u00a33.7m last year, said the US fine had been \"extremely damaging to HSBC's reputation\". The bank had already \"apologised unreservedly\" for the incident in its US and Mexican operations, he said.</p> <p>The UK's government bank levy cost HBSC $571m, just under half of which was on its balance sheet outside the UK, which Flint said knocked $0.03 off the bank's dividend, which stood at $0.45 per share for 2012. Another measure of return \u2013 which measures the difference between the return on capital deployed by shareholders and the cost of that capital \u2013 showed that the bank made an \"economic loss\" of $5.1bn. The directors were penalised for failing to meet their targets for return on equity of up to 15% by reporting 8.4% but received bonuses based on the capital strength as the crucial core tier one ratio was 12.3% above the 10% target.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Many of the world's largest economies may be weathering the toughest recessionary storms in living memory, but for those at the top there has rarely been an easier time to join the billionaires' club. Some 210 multi-millionaires were propelled into the premier league of extreme wealth in the last 12 months as they achieved 10-figure fortunes and the world now plays host to a record 1,426 dollar billionaires, according to Forbes magazine's study. This super-rich set together sit on wealth estimated at $5.4tn (\u00a33.6tn) \u2013 equal to more than a third of the annual output of the US, the world's largest economy. Last year the billionaires' club held a combined wealth of $4.6tn. At the top of the billionaire tree, once again, is the Mexican telecoms magnate Carlos Slim, with an estimated worth of $73bn, followed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has a fortune of $67bn. The success of the company behind Zara, the world's biggest rag\u2011trade operation, saw the retired Spanish entrepreneur Amancio Ortega \u2013 who still owns 60% of the business \u2013 climb into third place in the rankings. His fortune is put at $57bn. Despite Spain being locked in one of Europe's most crippling recessions, with 55% youth unemployment, Ortega was estimated to have seen the biggest rise in wealth of any billionaire, adding $19.5bn to his pot. As a result, he has leapfrogged Warren Buffett, the investment tycoon known as the Sage of Omaha, who last month swallowed up the Heinz food empire for $28bn. Buffett's wealth is put at $55.5bn. It is the first time in 13 years that he has not featured in Forbes' top three. Despite this slip, the rankings at the very top echelons of the billionaires' club remained remarkably static, dominated by wise heads that have weathered many recessions in the past. Of Forbes' top 10, eight are aged 70 or older. Trade union leaders, economists and anti-poverty campaigners said the swelling fortunes of the fast-expanding billlionaire set signalled that levels of wealth inequality were fast approaching crisis levels. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"These latest findings from Forbes make for very disturbing reading. Trickle-down economists may love having a growing super-elite, but seem to forget the fact that rising pay inequality was a major cause of the financial crash. \"Faced with flat wages, many people borrowed to maintain their living standards whilst the very wealthy put their cash into ever more risky investments to squeeze out returns. Unless wealth is spread more broadly, we will be unable to build a sustainable recovery, as consumer spending will continue to flat-line.\" Other senior figures to raise concerns over spiralling inequality include Angel Gurr\u00eda, OECD secretary general, who said \"widening disparities weaken the structures that hold our society together\", while Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, recently warned business leaders in Davos that \"the economics profession and the policy community have downplayed inequality for too long.\" Among the young turks to join the billionaires club in recent years are the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, 28, and his former collaborators Eduardo Saverin, 30, and Dustin Moskovitz, 28. Despite a fortune estimated at $3.8bn, Moskovitz is said to bike to work, shun business class flights and, according to Forbes, \"pitches his own tent at [Nevada desert counter-culture festival] Burning Man\". The Twitter co-founder and punk music fan Jack Dorsey also scrapes on to the list, with a fortune put at $1.1bn. Women were well represented among newcomers to the Forbes list, though they still only account for 138 of the world's billionaires, albeit up from 104 last year. The world's richest woman is the 90-year-old French cosmetics heiress Liliane Bettencourt, who is the ninth-richest person internationally. Her L'Or\u00e9al empire is best known for its \"because I'm worth it\" television advertising slogan. The US is home to 442 billionaires, according to Forbes, with 366 in Europe, 129 elsewhere in the Americas and 103 in the Middle East and Africa. Despite turbulent times for many of the largest economies in the world, 210 new billionaires were minted in the last 12 months \u2013 three times the number of individuals who fell off the list. This concentration of wealth took place despite a strengthening in the dollar against many major currencies. Credit Suisse, a Swiss bank that specialises in catering to super-rich clients, estimated last autumn that the world's richest 1% \u2013 that is, those with wealth of $710,000 and greater \u2013 control 46% of global assets. In its annual Global Wealth report, the bank estimated that the number of individuals with fortunes in excess of $50m around the world had reached 84,500. \"Notwithstanding the credit crisis and the more recent setbacks, the past decade has been especially conducive to the establishment of large fortunes,\" Credit Suisse concludes. The tax campaigner James Henry, a former economist with the global consultancy firm McKinsey, has estimated that between $21tn and $32tn of the world's wealth had been stashed, tax-free, in offshore investments \u2013 with about half of this sum controlled by the world's richest 91,000 people. \"Almost all of it has managed to avoid all income and estate taxes, either by the countries where it has been invested and or where it comes from,\" his study found. The highest-ranking British billionaire on Forbes' list is the Duke of Westminster, Gerald Grosvenor. His Grosvenor Group owns large tracts of land in Mayfair and Belgravia and can trace its roots back to 1677, is worth $11.4bn. Fourth on the UK rankings was his fellow land-owning aristocrat Lord Cadogan, whose Cadogan Estates includes a lot of real estate in Chelsea. Foreign billionaires who have made London their home and who feature in many UK rich lists were not classed as British by Forbes. Those not qualifying as British billionaires included the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, the Russian mining and investment tycoon Alisher Usmanov and the Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich.",

      "bodyText": "EasyJet, the airline founded in 1995 by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou with two borrowed planes, should, by close of trading on Tuesday, secure its place among Britain's blue-chip companies as a member of the FTSE 100. Bar a last-minute collapse in easyJet's shares, the FTSE group will confirm on Wednesday the remarkable rise of the upstart airline from Luton that now operates more than 1,000 flights a day across 600 routes. The airline's share price has more than doubled in the last year to 1018p \u2013 valuing the company at more than \u00a34bn, not far off that of British Airways' parent firm, International Airlines Group at \u00a34.4bn. EasyJet's chief executive, Carolyn McCall, who took over in July 2010, would bring to three the number of women at the helm of a FTSE 100 company. The airline's valuation has soared as traditional carriers have retrenched and cost-conscious business travellers have increasingly been filling its seats. Haji-Ioannou started painting the aviation world a garish orange 18 years ago by flying from Luton to Scotland with two Boeing 737-200s on a \"wet-lease\" \u2013 hired complete with air and ground crew. The airline took delivery of its first fully owned plane the following year and started international flights to Amsterdam. In 2000 it floated on the stock exchange. Significant milestones were the acquisitions of Go and then GB airways, greatly expanding easyJet's fleet and reach. Over the last decade it has opened bases in France, Germany, Spain and Italy, allied to its early Geneva base, capitalising on broader shifts in the airline industry and the problems besetting traditional carriers.

But where the board and Haji-Ioannou were on Monday united was in expressing delight at the impending elevation. EasyJet director of communications, Paul Moore, said that while the airline had never targeted a FTSE 100 place, it would be pleased to join the list. \"The share price reflects our successful strategy.

It's the fact that he's always on their case makes them a better board.\" High flyer Carolyn McCall would join Angela Ahrendts at fashion group Burberry and Alison Cooper of Imperial Tobacco as one of only three women running London's top 100 public companies if easyJet is promoted to the blue chip index on Wednesday. The number of female bosses has fallen after the departure of Dame Marjorie Scardino from Pearson and Cynthia Carroll from Anglo American. Scardino was the first woman FTSE 100 chief executive when she took charge at the Financial Times owner in 1997, but stepped down in October \u2013 followed days later by Carroll's resignation from the mining giant. McCall, the 51-year-old former chief executive of Guardian Media Group, has won plaudits since joining easyJet in July 2010 and is credited by many analysts with improved focus on customer service in a male-dominated industry. Douglas McNeill of Charles Stanley said: \"There was a turnaround in fortunes that can be dated to McCall's arrival.

For a start, it sees nothing wrong in handing a \u00a32m bonus to the boss in a year in which the bank took a record-breaking fine of \u00a31.2bn in the US for money-laundering and sanctions breaches. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver, it should be said, was well away from the bank's main board when the offences were taking place (mainly 2004-10). All the same, you might have expected the \"balanced scorecard\" approach to directors' bonuses at HSBC to be suspended for a year to underline corporate penitence. After all, on any sober calculation of relative sins, HSBC's dealings with Mexican drug bandits were surely several leagues more serious than other banks' Libor-rigging scandals. The absence of uproar may be related to the other way in which HSBC is different: it is well-capitalised, pays a proper dividend to shareholders and is close to earning returns in excess of the cost of shareholders' equity. On capital, HSBC will soon be at 10.3% on the Basel committee's more stringent definition of tier 1 capital, which is within touching distance of the demand for 10.5% by 2019. Last year's dividend was raised 11% and a 10% increase for the first nine months of this year was pre-announced on Monday. It means dividends are now about 65% of the pre-crisis level of 2007 and the yield on the shares is now almost 4.5%. Very few banks can make similar boasts. Incidentally, for Gulliver, with a personal shareholding worth \u00a333m after years of service in the investment banking division, the 2012 dividend is worth \u00a31.5m. Return on equity fell to 8.4% from 10.9%. The mad accounting rules of valuing the bank's own debt were partly to blame (improvements in credit valuations force banks to take a hit to profits) and the various fines and mis-selling charges also played a significant role. But, assuming those whacks aren't repeated, a proper economic profit lies around the next corner. All it should require is a continuation of last year's growth in underlying revenues (7%) and a tighter grip on costs, an area where Gulliver scored zero on his performance scorecard. The big picture, then, at HSBC is straightforward: the bank is enjoying beautiful trading conditions in the Far East while the west, especially the US and Europe, is a drag. Given that the former is so much bigger than the latter, the ship moves on. Add an extra kicker for clearing out small and sub-par units, and the bank is now a model of stability again. Just imagine how good things could have been for shareholders without the appalling 2003 acquisition of US sub-prime lender Household and the disgraceful money-laundering episode. HSBC could have been an exciting growth story, rather than an illustration of strength through diversity.",

      "bodyText": "Time to stop, after a fairly slow-moving day, I\"m afraid. Tomorrow should be more exciting, when EU finance ministers meet to finalise plans for a clampdown on bankers bonuses. Here's a brief closing summary. \u2022 Eurozone finance minister are meeting in Brussels tonight. They have already discussed Cyprus's bailout request, with sources telling Reuters that they will commit to an agreement by the end of March (see 5.43pm for the latest) \u2022 Portugal was also due to put its case for an extension to its bailout targets, after widespread protests over the weekend. (see 9.50am for details of Portugal's problems, and 10.03am for some photos of the demonstrations) \u2022 The radical Five Star Movement's MPs and senators have held their first meeting, and chosen their first parliamentary leaders. The movement's cofounder, Beppe Grillo, also reiterated that the group will not back another party in any vote of confidence. (see 5.55pm) \u2022 The latest Spanish unemployment data has shown another rise, with the Labour ministry reporting that almost 60,000 lost their jobs in February. This pushed the total to 5.0 million, with roughly another million not appearing in the statistics (see 9.03am) \u2022 George Osborne is preparing for a battle over Europe's plans to cap bankers' pay. The UK chancellor is unlikely to persuade fellow finance ministers to change course (see 4pm) \u2022 Latvia confirmed it would apply to join the euro (see 1.14pm) \u2022 European stock markets had a mixed day (see closing prices here), with the Italian market seeing the biggest fall. Earlier, one leading Chinese index suffered its biggest fall since November 2010, after a clampdown on the country's property boom (see 10.40am) Thanks for reading and commenting -- see you all tomorrow? Goodnight! And finally, an update on the Five Star Movement's meeting today, which was live-streamed (see 2.05pm). Each of the party's MPs and senators introduced themselves at the event, saying a few words and receiving a friendly round of applause from their fellows. Because of the party's policy of picking candidates online, the new parliamentarians hadn't really met before. They also elected their first parliamentary leaders. Vito Crimi, a 40-year old judicial assistant from the Northern town of Brescia, will lead M5S in the senate. Roberta Lombardi, who holds a law degree and works for a furniture company, is the first M5S leader in the lower house. (more details on La Stampa). Open Europe, the think tank, was quite impressed by the scene, commenting: Whatever one thinks of the Five-Star Movement, it was quite impressive to see so many Italian MPs in their thirties (or even twenties) in the same room. Finally some fresh air in Italian politics, some might say. We still don't know what the Five-Star Movement will do next. Grillo made a quick appearance at the very beginning of the meeting today, saying that the Movement will only vote for the laws which fit with its manifesto - but he said that several times before. It remains to be seen how this enthusiastic but inexperienced lot will react when the new Italian parliament convenes - on 15 March, or a bit earlier - and talks on the formation of the next government enter their decisive stage. The time for post-election celebrations may already be over for the Grillini. The question is: will this innovative approach to party politics hold (think party discipline) when things get serious? Just in from Brussels - Eurozone finance ministers have finished discussing Cyprus's bailout request, and it appears that they've made little progress. Reuters reports: Euro zone finance ministers have not yet agreed how to bail out Cyprus but are committed to having a deal ready by the end of the month, two European Union officials told Reuters on Monday. \"The (Eurogroup) statement will say that a deal is due at the end of March but there is no progress on what the programme should look like,\" one of the officials involved in the negotiations told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Euro zone finance ministers and European Union institutions have not been able so far to bridge differences over whether to make bank depositors pay a share of the cost of a Cypriot bailout. Cyprus is looking for around \u20ac17bn, much of which is needed to recapitalise its banking sector following big losses on Greek debts. As mentioned this morning, Germany's concerns over money-laundering through the Cypriot financial sector - denied by its government - remain a big hurdle. Kit Juckes, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's top foreign exchange guru, just warned Bloomberg TV that Europe's lack of a economic growth plan needs to be resolved, given the huge debts of countries such as Italy/ As he put it: The reality is the crisis isn't over, and there isn't an economic plan for growth in Europe. adding that it's hard to imagine what shape Europe will be in, in 10 year's time, even if you believe the euro will survive the decade. Another sign that some financial experts share the general concerns about Europe's austerity drive. The Italian stock markets has ended the day as the worst performer of the main Europe markets. Closing prices Italian FTSE MIB: down 133 points at 15542, -0.85% FTSE 100: down 32 points at 6345, -0.5% German DAX: down 16 points at 7691, -0.2% French CAC: up 9 points at 3709, +0.27% Spanish IBEX: up 59 points at 8246, +0.7% The tumbling Chinese stock market (see 10.40am) has hit mining stocks, while UK bank shares are also down after HSBC's results this morning. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, commented: London shares have struggled to make headway all day, having been put on the back foot by the Chinese government\u2019s decision to introduce new measures to take some heat out of the property market. Risk-on stocks such as miners have been hit by this, on fears of reduced demand from the supposedly-insatiable Chinese market. However, one of the more disturbing elements of current market action is the unwillingness of such companies to participate in any upward move. Financial stocks remain in the spotlight following HSBC\u2019s results, although the bank escaped the heavy selling that followed results from the state-backed RBS and Lloyds. Today's eurogroup meeting is, for once, just a taster ahead of the big action tomorrow -- a clash between Britain and the rest of the EU over the plan to cap bankers bonuses. George Osborne, the UK chancellor, is hoping to make last-ditch changes to the plan, announced last week, to cap performance-related payouts at 100% of salaries. He's likely to fail. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, sets the scene: In a highly unusual defeat for the British financial services sector, illustrating the UK's deepening isolation in Europe and the reluctance of EU partners to do Britain any more favours, finance ministers of the other 26 are expected to endorse new legislation to slash \"fat cat\" bonuses. The decision to limit bonuses ordinarily to a year's salary was made last week at hard-fought negotiations between the European Parliament and officials from the 27 member states. Despite David Cameron's denunciation of the deal and Osborne's pledges to contest it, the decision appears irreversible. The UK is unable to wield a veto as Tuesday's decision can go to a qualified majority vote if necessary. Britain has been unable to muster enough allies to block the proposal. Its likeliest supporters, Sweden, The Netherlands, and, most crucially, Germany have all come out in favour of capping bonuses. After David Cameron's success over the EU budget, it looks like Britain is returning to familiar isolation, as it cannot block the plan. However, Osborne could perhaps win some concessions.... More here The early news from the Five Star Movement meeting is that Beppe Grillo has reiterated that the party will not support any government in a vote of confidence (which is essential for a new administration to take power): Here's a live feed of the Five Star Movement's meeting: The meeting between Beppe Grillo and the new Five Star Movement parliamentarians has begun in Italy, and is being live-streamed at Grillo's site (click here). Unfortunately, the site appears to be struggling under the weight of traffic. I'll try and embed the livestream. Otherwise, I'll drop in the highlights ASAP. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Dutch finance minister and the new head of the Eurogroup, has told reporters in Brussels that he hopes to make progress on Cyprus's bailout application today. Dijsselbloem said he was looking forward to meeting the \"new colleague from Cyprus\", following last month's presidential election. However, the big breakthrough won't come today. Dijsselbloem added: Of course we're very glad that there is a new government that we can work with, to find a solution for Cyprus. As I've said before we're probably going to reach an agreement in March, that's what we're aiming at, and it's going to be an agreement that works on stabilisation, both for Cyprus and the eurozone as a whole. The full video clip is here. Latvia has taken the plunge and decided to apply to join the eurozone. Finance minister Andris Vilks told reporters this morning that the application will arrive in Brussels tomorrow, adding: This is a day that will enter Latvia's history. It's caused a bit of a buzz in Brussels, where eurocrats see it as a sign that the euro project is still on the road. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, told us all two weeks ago that the application would come in March. That article is well worth a read, with prime minister, Algirdas Butkevicius, explaining exactly why Latvia still wants to join the euro club. It's all about the security: \"We see it as a kind of insurance mechanism,\" said Dombrovskis. \"We don't expect to go back into a crisis. We're sticking with prudent fiscal policies and we don't expect to overheat our economy again. \"And whatever happens to the euro happens to us anyway. Our economy is completely euro-ised: 80% of borrowing, households and businesses, is in euros. This will help financial and economic stability.\" The political situation in Italy remains masked (ahem) in uncertainty today. Last night, centre-left leader Pier Luigi Bersani threw down a challenge to the Five Star Movement (M5S) warning leader Beppe Grillo that \"we'll all go home\" unless he backed a temporary government. Speaking on Italian TV, Bersani declared that: \u201cHe heads a movement that has a third of the Chamber, he needs to decide what he will do or we will all be sent packing, including Grillo. Bersani's failure to win a majority in the Italian Senate, and his refusal to form an alliance with Silvio Bersluconi, leave the former communist dependent on some kind of agreement with M5S. Grillo himself has taken to wearing a mask in public, in an effort to deter journalists from asking about his plans. Over the weekend he indicated that he might support a government that was committed to cleaning up Italian politics (a prospect he saw as somewhat remote) The situation could develop today - Grillo is due to meet with his new parliamentarians to discuss strategy. And Bloomberg are reporting that M5S is considering abstaining in an up-coming confidence vote. That, if it happened, would help a minority government to be created. Here's the Bloomberg story: Beppe Grillo\u2019s senators-elect, who hold a blocking minority in Italy\u2019s upper house of parliament, may consider staging a confidence-vote walk-out to allow a political rival to form a government and ease gridlock. Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement is seeking to influence the program of Italy\u2019s next government and would require policy concessions in exchange for a walk-out, said two senators-elect who declined to be identified because no deal has been made. Five Star won\u2019t vote to support any government, they said. Walking out would lower the threshold for achieving a majority in the Senate confidence vote, making it easier to secure enough backing for a new government. The political mess in Italy has alarmed investors, whose growing confidence over the euro area has taken a knock this month. The monthly eurozone investor confidence index, conducted by Sentix, has dropped to -10.6, down from -3.6 in February. That shows that investors across the eurozone have grown more nervous, reversing a six-month trend. Sentix blamed the Italy election results: The reason for this setback is obvious: it is the outcome of the election in Italy which has caused uncertainty over the country's future development to skyrocket....This has had a negative impact on the whole euro zone. Most of Europe's stock markets have fallen this morning, after the main Chinese indices suffered an alarming sell-off. Overnight the CSI 300 share index (which includes the biggest companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets) slumped by 4.6%, its biggest daily fall since November 2010. The Shanghai Composite index shed 3.7%, with property companies the biggest fallers. The selloff was prompted by a new clampdown on speculators, and plans to force second home owners to pay higher interest rates and larger deposits Some traders also blamed an investigation into China's 'ghost towns' -- newly built residential areas where no-one actually resides -- by CBS News's 60 Minutes. It showed images of vacant shops, empty streets, and half-built apartments where work appears to have suddenly stopped - suggesting that the Chinese property bubble may be bursting.... Here's a video clip: And here's the situation in Europe: FTSE 100: down 24 points at 6353, - 0.4% German DAX: down 42 points at 7665, -0.5% French CAC: down 8.5 points at 3691, - 0.23% Italian FTSE MIB: down 146 points at 15528, -0.93% Spanish IBEX: up 22 point at 8210, +0.3% Sharan Burrow, head of the international Trade Union Movement, argues that the International Monetary Fund should heed the public anger in Portugal. She argues that austerity is being challenged across Europe, with Dutch unions now clashing the Netherlands government over a \u20ac4bn cuts package. In the Netherlands, the government wants new wage freezes and tax rises after an official estimate that the Dutch budget deficit will hit 3.3% in 2013 and 3.4% per cent in 2014, over the EU's 3% target. Ton Heerts, head of the FNV federation of unions, has slammed the proposal as \u201cstupidest thing you could do right now\u201d, warning it will make the Dutch recession even worse (the FT has more details). Here's a few snaps from Saturday's anti-austerity demonstrations in the Portuguese capital: Last weekend's protests in Portugal were some of the largest seen in Europe during the crisis. Organisers said that half a million people joined the demonstrations in Lisbon, with hundreds of thousands more attending other protests st some thirty cities (photos to follow). The huge crowds in Lisbon's Praca do Comercio square chanted, \"It's time for the government to go\", and there were also slogans declaring \"Austerity Kills\" and \"Screw the Troika\". Last week, Portugal's government insisted it could not change its austerity programme, saying it would be \"rudderless in a sea of storms\" if it couldn't rely on the support of the International Monetary Fund and the IMF. However, Portual is expected to tell Eurogroup members today that it needs to be given an extra year to hit its bailout targets - a recognition that its recession is deeper than official forecasts. As the Wall Street Journal explains here (with a handy graphic): Portuguese officials acknowledge they overestimated tax revenues and underestimated how much money the country would have to spend on social benefits to the unemployed. They say Portugal has been hit hard by a deeper-than-expected slowdown in the euro zone, with which it does most of its trade. Labor unions and opposition parties have accused the government of blindly making spending cuts and raising taxes without realizing that they would contribute to a downward economic spiral. Full story: Portugal to Seek New Bailout Terms Euro finance ministers will begin today's Eurogroup meeting at 3pm Brussels time, or 2pm GMT. A press conference is expected at 8pm GMT. Matina Stevis, the WSJ's Brussels hotshot, flags up that ministers will consider whether to extend Ireland and Portugal's financial reform programmes, but doesn't believe any decisions will be taken: Gloomy economic news from Spain this morning \u2013 the number of people registered as out of work has risen by 1.2% last month, breaking through the 5 million barrier. The Labour ministry reported that the number of registered jobless in Spain rose by another 59,444, as the country's economy continued to contract. The data doesn't include around 1 million people who are out of work, but not registered as such. The austerity programme being implemented by the current government is widely blamed for stifling economic growth and driving people out of work. As this chart shows, employment in Spain has been falling since the financial crisis began, a trend that accelerated in the last two years: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other major events in the world economy. The finance ministers of the eurozone will have a lot to chew on today when they gather in Brussels this afternoon for the latest Eurogroup meeting. Top of the list - Cyprus's bailout, which is back on the agenda following the election of Nicos Anastasiades last week. The \u20ac17bn package had stalled over the country's reluctance to sell state assets, and Germany's concerns that much of the aid would (it claims) benefit criminals who use the island's banking sector for money-laundering. The eurogroup is also expected to discuss the situation in Italy, mired in political uncertainty following last month's general election. Ministers are likely to insist that Italy sticks to its commitments, following last week's rise in Italian bond yields -- despite the wave of support for anti-austerity candidates, which leaves president Giorgio Napolitano struggling to form a government. The talk this morning is that a second technocratic government could be installed, or that fresh elections will be called this summer. And ministers may also be alarmed by the huge protests in Portugal over the weekend, with mass rallies urging the Lisbon government to halt its austerity programme. Europe's drive for spending cuts and tax rises has already been shaken by the Italian election results. Could the Portuguese protests help to turn the tide? As usual, we'll be tracking the latest development through the day.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Debenhams shares crash on profits warning", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Debenhams blamed the snow for a surprise profits warning that sent its shares tumbling more than 14% on Monday. Sales at Britain's second-largest department store chain dropped 10% in the two weeks of January during which the UK was blanketed in snow, and failed to recover in February, hitting full-year profits and margins. The chief executive, Michael Sharp, said disruption from the snow had affected all retailers, pointing to data from accountants BDO that showed like-for-like sales across the sector dropped by an average of 9% over the two-week period. \"The disappointing factor is the impact of snow,\" he said. \"It's quite clear what the problem was and it's now behind us.\" But analysts said Debenhams appeared to be among the worst hit, as it failed to recoup full-price sales in the following weeks. Overall, UK retail sales in February enjoyed their strongest growth for three years, according to the latest health check of the sector. The British Retail Consortium-KPMG retail sales monitor released today showed like-for-like retail sales rising 2.7% compared with February last year. Helen Dickinson, director general of the BRC, said: \"After the disappointing figures that brought 2012 to a close, it's reassuring that the sales momentum established during January has built, not faded. There are certainly highly welcome signs here of gradual improvement and customers feeling a bit more positive. But it's too soon to assume this represents the permanent turnaround we need.\" Food sales held up well, with like-for-like sales up 1% over the year, despite the horsemeat scandal. Joanne Denney-Finch, chief executive of industry analysts IGD, said: \"Although there was a lot of 'switch buying', such as a fall in frozen burger sales in favour of more ingredients to cook from scratch, the overall effect on food and drink sales was neutral.\" Like-for-like sales of other, non-food products rose by 1.9% over the year. The survey said department stores performed well, as promotions helped to boost sales. Separately, Visa Europe said a survey of consumer spending showed a second successive monthly rise last month. Spending on Visa cards, which account for one in three of all purchases, was 0.8% higher in February following a 0.9% rise in January, though the underlying trend was still weak, with a decline in the rate from one quarter to the next of 1.1%. Debenhams said it launched promotions for Valentine's Day, half-term and the end of the month to try to make up for the dire performance during the icy weather, but failed to fully recover sales lost in January. As a result, it expects pre-tax profits for the first half to come in at \u00a3120m, rather than the \u00a3130m analysts had pencilled in, and more than 5% lower than in the first half last year. Like-for-like sales for the six months to 2 March rose 3%. Sharp said the snow fell during the key January sales period, so there was still leftover Christmas stock to shift after the thaw. \"When you get into February, people are starting to look for new products.\" That meant last year's stock had to come with even deeper discounts, he said, which hit margins. Gross margins for the first half will be around 0.2% lower than in the same period last year and will be unchanged over the full year, rather than rising by 0.1% as previously forecast. That will worry analysts, who say Debenhams has been buying too much stock and discounting heavily to clear it. Kate Calvert of Seymour Pierce said: \"They are hooked on promotions. Their customers know there is no point paying full price for things.\" But Sharp defended the store's strategy. \"Customers like our promotions, they feel they offer genuine value for money and that is one of the reasons they shop with us.\" Debenhams is aiming for 4% growth in like-for-like sales in the second half and is thought to be buying enough stock to meet that target. Calvert said: \"That seems a very aggressive trading strategy in the current climate.\" Sharp said conditions on the high street would remain tough this year. \"The reality of life is we are bumping along the bottom. We've talked in the past about customers becoming acclimatised to the new economic reality. We are not expecting any bounce-back this year.\" But he was confident Debenhams could grow sales in the second half. The shares dropped to 81p.",

      "body": "<p>Debenhams blamed the snow for a surprise profits warning that sent its shares tumbling more than 14% on Monday.</p> <p>Sales at Britain's second-largest department store chain dropped 10% in the two weeks of January during which the UK was blanketed in snow, and failed to recover in February, hitting full-year profits and margins.</p> <p>The chief executive, Michael Sharp, said disruption from the snow had affected all retailers, pointing to data from accountants BDO that showed like-for-like sales across the sector dropped by an average of 9% over the two-week period.</p> <p>\"The disappointing factor is the impact of snow,\" he said. \"It's quite clear what the problem was and it's now behind us.\"</p> <p>But analysts said Debenhams appeared to be among the worst hit, as it failed to recoup full-price sales in the following weeks.</p> <p>Overall, UK retail sales in February enjoyed their strongest growth for three years, according to the latest health check of the sector. The British Retail Consortium-KPMG retail sales monitor released today showed like-for-like retail sales rising 2.7% compared with February last year.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, director general of the BRC, said: \"After the disappointing figures that brought 2012 to a close, it's reassuring that the sales momentum established during January has built, not faded. There are certainly highly welcome signs here of gradual improvement and customers feeling a bit more positive. But it's too soon to assume this represents the permanent turnaround we need.\"</p> <p>Food sales held up well, with like-for-like sales up 1% over the year, despite the horsemeat scandal. Joanne Denney-Finch, chief executive of industry analysts IGD, said: \"Although there was a lot of 'switch buying', such as a fall in frozen burger sales in favour of more ingredients to cook from scratch, the overall effect on food and drink sales was neutral.\"</p> <p>Like-for-like sales of other, non-food products rose by 1.9% over the year. The survey said department stores performed well, as promotions helped to boost sales.</p> <p>Separately, Visa Europe said a survey of consumer spending showed a second successive monthly rise last month. Spending on Visa cards, which account for one in three of all purchases, was 0.8% higher in February following a 0.9% rise in January, though the underlying trend was still weak, with a decline in the rate from one quarter to the next of 1.1%.</p> <p>Debenhams said it launched promotions for Valentine's Day, half-term and the end of the month to try to make up for the dire performance during the icy weather, but failed to fully recover sales lost in January. As a result, it expects pre-tax profits for the first half to come in at \u00a3120m, rather than the \u00a3130m analysts had pencilled in, and more than 5% lower than in the first half last year. Like-for-like sales for the six months to 2 March rose 3%.</p> <p>Sharp said the snow fell during the key January sales period, so there was still leftover Christmas stock to shift after the thaw. \"When you get into February, people are starting to look for new products.\" That meant last year's stock had to come with even deeper discounts, he said, which hit margins. Gross margins for the first half will be around 0.2% lower than in the same period last year and will be unchanged over the full year, rather than rising by 0.1% as previously forecast.</p> <p>That will worry analysts, who say Debenhams has been buying too much stock and discounting heavily to clear it. Kate Calvert of Seymour Pierce said: \"They are hooked on promotions. Their customers know there is no point paying full price for things.\" But Sharp defended the store's strategy. \"Customers like our promotions, they feel they offer genuine value for money and that is one of the reasons they shop with us.\"</p> <p>Debenhams is aiming for 4% growth in like-for-like sales in the second half and is thought to be buying enough stock to meet that target. Calvert said: \"That seems a very aggressive trading strategy in the current climate.\"</p> <p>Sharp said conditions on the high street would remain tough this year. \"The reality of life is we are bumping along the bottom. We've talked in the past about customers becoming acclimatised to the new economic reality. We are not expecting any bounce-back this year.\" But he was confident Debenhams could grow sales in the second half. The shares dropped to 81p.</p>",

The company employs about 80,000 people and sales in 2011-12 reached \u00a310.8bn, of which more than half came from outside the UK, chalking up pre-tax profits of \u00a3807m. While Kingfisher also runs Screwfix, which has a major online presence in trade tools and hardware, and sells thousands of lines through its web sites, some of the company's other popular product lines \u2013 such as new kitchens, paints and other decorations, and gardening products \u2013 are still more likely to attract customers to physical stores. Nevertheless, \"if I were starting today, I'd start Screwfix not B&amp;Q,\" said Cheshire.",
