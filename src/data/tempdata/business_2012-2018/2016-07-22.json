      "bodyText": "Trade unions are seeking the support of City investors for a resolution to be put to Sports Direct\u2019s annual general meeting calling for a fully independent review of working practices at the embattled retailer. At a meeting on Tuesday the TUC and Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest union, presented their resolution to representatives of leading fund managers including Aberdeen Asset Management and HSBC\u2019s investment arm. Influential pension funds such as the Railways Pension Scheme were also at the crowded meeting at the TUC\u2019s headquarters in London as well as a representative from the Investor Forum, which works behind the scenes to put pressure on companies. Unite confirmed the plan to submit a resolution but declined to comment further because the meeting was held in private. Sports Direct \u2013 which did not immediately comment \u2013 will hold its AGM on 7 September at its head office in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where the company also has its giant warehouse. The Guardian\u2019s investigation into conditions at Shirebrook revealed an environment where workers were afraid to speak out over pay and conditions for fear of losing their jobs. It is unusual for big fund managers to consult with trade unions about how to bring about change at a company. But investors have become increasingly alarmed about how Sports Direct is run, particularly after financial performance suffered, and are prepared to back the resolution. A City source who was at the meeting said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen very often. The number of people in the room, the degree of attention paid and the close interest in the information that was coming from the unions is a sign that this company is causing a lot of concern. \u201cMost people now recognise that no company prospers if it exploits its workforce and this company looks like it might be exploiting its workforce. If the resolution is worded sensibly it will be difficult for sensible people not to agree with it.\u201d The meeting was held before MPs published a scathing report into Sports Direct that accused Mike Ashley, the company\u2019s majority owner, of running the company like a \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d. The business, innovation and skills committee said Sports Direct\u2019s success is based on treating workers without dignity and respect. Responding to the report, the Institute of Directors\u2019 business group said Sports Direct risked damaging the standing of all British companies. Simon Walker, the IoD\u2019s director general, said: \u201cI implore Mike Ashley to reflect on the deep damage he has done to public trust in business. He, the chairman Keith Hellawell and the board of Sports Direct should take immediate steps to improve conditions for his staff.\u201d The City source said: \u201cThe MPs haven\u2019t pulled any punches and that is only going to stiffen [investors\u2019] sinews.\u201d Ashley admitted to the business committee last month that conditions at Shirebrook were unacceptable. He has appointed a law firm, RPC, to conduct a review but the unions say RPC is not sufficiently independent because it has acted for Ashley on several occasions. Ashley is also carrying out his own review, which he told MPs would never end. He increased pay for workers at Shirebrook in January to more than the minimum wage. The Investor Forum, whose members include big investors such as Legal &amp; General, met to discuss Sports Direct in December soon after the Guardian\u2019s revelations about Shirebrook. The forum is understood to have discussed Sports Direct regularly since and is pushing for changes to take place before the AGM.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green is facing an uphill battle in his attempt to bail out BHS\u2019s pension fund after the British vote to leave the European Union added about \u00a3100m to the potential bill. As MPs prepare to publish a report on the demise of BHS on Monday, Green is in talks with regulators and pension fund trustees about how to fulfil his promise to \u201csort\u201d the failed department store\u2019s pension deficit, which stood at \u00a3571m on one measure at the time of the company\u2019s collapse. Industry experts said a plunge in the value of gilt yields after the EU referendum had contributed to a near 19% rise in the average value of pension deficits controlled by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), a lifeboat scheme funded by levies on industry, between February and June. This indicates a rise of about \u00a3100m for the BHS scheme. In order to ensure members of BHS\u2019s schemes receive full pension benefits, Green\u2019s total bill could now be about \u00a3670m, valued on a buyout basis that includes the assumed overheads that an insurance company would seek to recoup. Green, who sold BHS for \u00a31 to the formerly bankrupt Dominic Chappell about a year before the retailer went into administration, remains responsible for bailing out the pension deficit as regulators have powers to pursue former owners. The former BHS owner is thought to be hoping to work out a deal under which he could use cash lump sums to buy out members of the pension scheme who have savings of less than \u00a318,000. That would leave a small number of remaining members who could transfer to a new scheme, potentially knocking hundreds of millions of pounds off Green\u2019s bill. A spokesman for Green\u2019s Arcadia Group declined to comment but sources close to the company admitted the deal would need more work given Brexit\u2019s impact on the pension deficit. Lord Myners, the former M&amp;S chairman who is working as an adviser to MPs investigating BHS\u2019s pension problems, has suggested such a deal could cost about \u00a3400m. Green began working on the plan, then named Project Thor, when he owned BHS, but decided to sell the business before a deal had been agreed. When BHS went into administration, the pension scheme automatically fell under the auspices of the PPF. Pensions experts said the PPF\u2019s rules meant it would now be much tougher for Green to buy out BHS fund members with small pension pots. The lifeboat\u2019s rules do not allow him to buy out individual members unless its lawyers can be assured that no members of the scheme are disproportionately benefiting or losing out. John Ralfe, an independent pensions expert, said no such deal had ever been agreed with the PPF and it would be difficult for Green to break new ground. An alternative would be to move all members to a new scheme and then offer to buy out those with small pension pots \u2013 potentially a highly expensive move. \u201cThere is no clever \u2018financial engineering\u2019 solution available. The only way for Sir Philip to square the circle, and remove the threat of legal action, is to agree a big cash payment with the Pensions Regulator,\u201d Ralfe said. Frank Field MP, chairman of parliament\u2019s work and pensions committee which has been investigating the demise of BHS, said: \u201cSir Philip can break the logjam by signing a cheque. The only restraint is his generosity.\u201d Given the complexity of agreeing a deal within Green\u2019s budget, it\u2019s thought to be unlikely that pensioners will hear about the future of their savings before the end of the year. Chris Martin, chairman of the BHS pension fund trustees, said: \u201cThe trustees are really positive about the possibility of finding a solution but are also very conscious that sorting out the practicalities and technical complexities may take some time.\u201d The importance of the PPF reaching a deal with Green was laid bare on Thursday. The body\u2019s annual report revealed that the value of claims on the PPF rose by \u00a3322m to \u00a3476m in the year to the end of March, with BHS making up more than half the value of all claims on the pensions lifeboat in the year. For technical reasons, including its ability to trim benefits to members by 10%, the cost to the lifeboat of bailing out BHS\u2019s pensions scheme is \u00a3275m. On Friday, a second administrator tasked with investigating the role of former directors was appointed to BHS after pressure from the PPF. FRP Advisory will work alongside the existing administrators at Duff &amp; Phelps.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s knighthood is under review following complaints about his former ownership of the failed department store chain BHS, it has emerged. The Cabinet Office confirmed in a letter to a Labour MP that it was looking into Green\u2019s knighthood after there were a number of calls for him to be stripped of the honour. The statement to Jim McMahon set out the process of cancelling an honour, which has to be recommended by the Cabinet Office and forfeiture committee before being approved by the Queen. It said: \u201cI hope you will understand that I cannot comment on the particular circumstances of Sir Philip, but I can assure you that the case is being reviewed.\u201d Green has been heavily criticised for taking large sums of money out of BHS before selling the company to a three-time bankrupt just over a year before it failed. MPs on the Commons work and pensions committee are expected to heavily criticise the actions of Green, who sold BHS for \u00a31 to Dominic Chappell in March 2015, in a report scheduled to be published shortly. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said on Friday: \u201cApplications for forfeiture are considered by an independent committee. They have been clear that they will not consider reviewing an honour until any formal reviews or investigations which establish the facts of a case have been completed. However, we continue to keep the case under review.\u201d Last week, Green set out a robust defence of his stewardship of BHS, claiming that he put \u00a3421m into the group during his 15 years at the helm. In a letter to MPs investigating the demise of BHS, which is being wound down after falling into administration with a \u00a3571m pension fund deficit, Green said: \u201cIt is clear that we invested substantially in the business.\u201d The amount of capital investment highlighted by Green during his tenure almost exactly matches the \u00a3423m paid in dividends to his family and other BHS shareholders between 2000 and 2004. It is part of the more than \u00a3580m, including rental payments and interest, extracted from the company under his control. The review of Green\u2019s knighthood comes at a time when the government is embroiled in a row about David Cameron\u2019s decision to draw up a list of honours in his last week in office. It was reported on Thursday that some of Cameron\u2019s suggestions for peerages or other honours for his advisers and supporters have been blocked by the Cabinet Office, delaying the publication of the final list. At least three Tory donors were vetoed last year over concerns about their suitability to be peers. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cFirst David Cameron overruled civil service advice in order to give massive payoffs to his special advisers and now we learn officials have reportedly raised concerns about the suitability of some of his resignation honours. \u201cGiven the former prime minister previously claimed to want to clean up the political system this level of cronyism is astounding.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Brexit vote has delivered a boost to Heathrow\u2019s fortunes, with the weak pound attracting foreign investors, encouraging international passengers to spend more in its terminals, and strengthening the airport\u2019s case for expansion, the chief executive has claimed. The airport has reported an 8% rise in profits for the first six months of this year, driven by an increase in retail sales that John Holland-Kaye suggested could accelerate with the further drop in sterling since the referendum on 23 June. \u201cWith the exchange rate dropping, it\u2019s better value to shop at the airport than at the destinations,\u201d he said. The growth in airport shopping revenues came despite a decline in \u201cbig spenders\u201d from Russia, China and Nigeria, he said. In recent weeks Heathrow had \u201cseen there\u2019s a huge appetite to invest: we\u2019ve done a lot of deals and refinancing abroad, we just raised around \u00a385m in Norwegian kroner at very attractive terms\u201d, Holland-Kaye added. He said while buying into the UK had become much cheaper for foreign investors, there was also a \u201cflight to quality \u2026 We\u2019re a very safe, long-term investment for people.\u201d Releasing its results, the airport chief said the referendum had further strengthened the case for expansion: \u201cIn an uncertain economic environment, a \u00a316bn privately funded infrastructure investment will create up to 180,000 jobs and \u00a3211bn of growth across the UK. Only Heathrow expansion will allow exporters to trade with all the growing markets of the world.\u201d However, the head of the National Audit Office, Sir Amyas Morse, has warned that major infrastructure projects may have to be culled as the government prepares for a costly Brexit. Although the runway would be privately financed, additional road and rail infrastructure to support expansion was estimated to cost \u00a35.7bn by the Airports Commission and up to \u00a310bn more by Transport for London, a figure Heathrow disputes. Holland-Kaye expects a decision on the third runway to come in early September, more than a year after the Airports Commission delivered its recommendation to the government. \u201cLook at the energy that the government has been putting in to showing their difference to the previous administration \u2013 they want a positive plan for the post-Brexit world and to assure everyone that Britain is open for business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw the difficulty David Cameron had. Theresa May is very different, she\u2019s at the height of her powers and this is a time when she drives big change and shows she means business.\u201d However, May opposed the Labour decision to build a third runway in 2009, and ministers who were ardent critics of the expansion, including Justine Greening, Boris Johnson, and Philip Hammond, have gained heavyweight promotions under May. Some bookmakers have recently reduced the odds on Gatwick beating Heathrow in the race for an additional runway. But Holland-Kaye said: \u201cLook at what the government is trying to achieve \u2013 there\u2019s only one game in town for that. If we want to go to long-haul markets rather than short-haul EU, we are the ones who get you there. There\u2019s no logic for going against the Airports Commission policy recommendation.\u201d Airlines have trimmed their profit forecasts for the coming years, with demand expected to fall along with UK growth rates. Holland-Kaye said Heathrow would withstand such a decline, pointing out that passenger numbers had dropped only slightly during the 2008 financial crisis and then bounced back. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a decision for one or two years but a long-term decision, something for 10 years\u2019 time when the economy will be different,\u201d he said. The Heathrow chief was speaking on Friday morning before what was expected to be one the busiest ever days at the London hub, with 136,000 departing passengers at the start of the summer break.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s a good moment to wrap up for the day, and indeed the week. Here\u2019s our full news story about the worrying slide in UK business confidence, activity and new orders this month: We\u2019ll be back next week with more rolling coverage of the twists and turns in the economy, the financial markets and more. Thanks, and have a good weekend. GW Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, fears that the UK economy might be in even worse shape than the PMI show. That\u2019s because today\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 survey doesn\u2019t include the construction industry, which has probably also taken a Brexit hit. The full PMIs, released in a couple of weeks, will give a fuller picture. Larry adds: The abrupt and large fall in both orders and output reported by IHS Markit and the CIPS clearly makes a recession in the second half of 2016 a real risk. Similar results for August and September would suggest a 0.4% contraction in the economy in the third quarter. It only takes two successive quarters of contraction to constitute a technical recession. More here: Newsflash from America: The US manufacturing sector has grown at its fastest pace in a year, suggesting the Brexit vote has not caused any problems. The US manufacturing PMI has jumped to 52.9, from 51.3 in June, the highest figure since last October (any figure over 5o shows growth). Quite a contrast with the UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI, which dived from 52.1 in June to just 49.1 this month. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll all score full marks on our new Brexit quiz..... It\u2019s now a month since the UK\u2019s EU referendum, so my colleague Martin Belam has taken a look at the economic, financial and social impact of that historic vote: And Ben Chu of the Independent has calculated that the taxpayer\u2019s stake in two British banks has shrunk by \u00a36bn: Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says the government needs to take action now to combat the slowdown gripping the UK economy. Speaking on Sky News, McDonnell says Philip Hammond shouldn\u2019t wait until the autumn statement to scrap the government\u2019s fiscal plans. I think he needs to get back here now, scrap the fiscal framework that is failing at the moment, and start the investment that is needed. Right now, government departments are pausing investment decisions and implementing austerity measures, at a time when the economy needs more help, McDonnell adds. And finally... Oops, Faisal hadn\u2019t finished explaining the wonders of the PMI report.... Back to the grim UK PMI report... and Faisal Islam of Sky News has tweeted why this survey is worth taking seriously: It\u2019s also worth noting that Markit survey purchasing managers at over 1,200 UK firms each month; this is a serious report. Christine Lagarde\u2019s lawyer says she is confident of proving her innocence over the Tapie case. Breaking news from France: The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has lost her final attempt to avoid appearing in court over a long-running financial scandal. Reuters has the details: France\u2019s highest appeals court ruled on Friday that IMF chief Christine Lagarde must stand trial for her role in a \u20ac400m payout as French finance minister in 2008 to businessman Bernard Tapie. The court rejected her appeal against a judge\u2019s order in December for her to stand trial at the Cour de Justice de la Repulique, a special court that tries ministers for crimes in office. Here\u2019s some background on the Tapie affair: Some mild optimism from the Resolution Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon: Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at City firm Monex Europe, also fears that Britain is heading into recession. Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s PMI survey: \u201cThe report makes for grim reading and suggests that the shock to the economy will be severe compared to others on record. Composite Output and New Orders, which include data for other sectors of the economy, registered their steepest ever recorded falls. Although an increase in manufacturing export business offers a ray of hope, it\u2019s difficult to see how this report points to anything other than a recession in the immediate future. \u201cThe question now is just how deep and sustained this slump in output will prove. With services activity and new orders falling at their quickest rate in seven years the risk of businesses delaying investment and hiring is very significant. If the slump is extended or worsens into August and July, even the reduced forecasts we\u2019ve recently seen for growth in 2016 will start to look optimistic. Sky News\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway has collared chancellor Philip Hammond in China, and got him to comment on today\u2019s PMI survey. Hammond says the PMI shows that business sentiment has suffered from the Brexit vote. It tells us that people\u2019s confidence, businesses\u2019 confidence has been dented. They\u2019re not sure, there\u2019re in a position of uncertainty now. Our job is to restore as much certainty as we can, as quickly as we can. That means reaching agreements with European partners, and also striking deals with other countries such as China, the chancellor says. [reminder: He\u2019s hoping to drum up some investment opportunities during his trip to Beijing, before arriving at the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers this weekend]. Philip Hammond also repeated that he could \u201creset fiscal policy\u201d in the autumn statement later this year, once the government has a clearer picture of the UK economy after the Brexit vote. We are clear that we are going to support the economy over this period, so we can take advantage of the opportunities that the referendum gives us in the medium and long term. The pound is sliding deeper into the red, as investors digest the news that Britain\u2019s companies have suffered their worst month since the financial crisis. Sterling is now down 1% against the US dollar at $1.31, down from $1.323 overnight. Some traders are pricing in a cut in UK interest rates in August, and perhaps a wide-ranging stimulus package to help the economy. Encouragingly, Markit also found that companies become less gloomy as July unfolded. The rapid political changes that saw Theresa May installed as prime minister last week may have reassure business leaders, according to Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson. The slump in the UK PMI, from 52.4 to just 47.7, shows that UK businesses are gripped by Brexit uncertainty. Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says Westminster needs to take action, fast. \u201cThe very sharp pause in activity indicates that manufacturers have reacted to the shock of the referendum result by adopting a wait-and-see approach. A key question is how long this will be sustained, as a failure to restart activity will have implications for their appetite for investment and recruitment, and thus have an implication for the real economy. The uncertainty surrounding the outlook for manufacturing highlights that there is potential for the Government to shore up confidence in the coming months.\u201d It\u2019s not ALL bad news, though. UK manufacturers have reported the biggest jump in new exports in two years, Markit says. That suggests the slump in the pound since the referendum is providing a boost, making exports more competitive: Perhaps the most alarming part of today\u2019s survey is that service sector companies are extremely downbeat about economic prospects. Markit\u2019s business expectations index has slumped by its largest amount on record, back to levels last seen during the financial crisis: This implies service sector firms will be cautious about taking on new staff or launching new projects in the coming months. Today\u2019s report is vindication for those Remain campaigners who warned against Brexit, argues journalist Sunny Hundal: Markit\u2019s PMI surveys have undermined the notion that the rest of Europe would suffer as badly as the UK from the Brexit vote. While Britain appears to be shrinking, France\u2019s economy was quite resilient and German private sector growth hit its highest level of the year (see earlier post). Ferdinando Giugliano of the La Republica newspaper tweets the key numbers: Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, reckons Europe is actually benefitting from the uncertainty: Today has shown a stark contrast between Eurozone and UK economic fortunes in the wake of the EU referendum, with the negative impact felt after the vote largely isolated to the UK. There is perhaps a feeling amongst the likes of France and German that the vote is a case of the UK shooting itself in the foot, with a significant amount of business expected to leave the UK in favour of Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin. There is no surprise that the eurozone services PMI readings have shown particular strength, with the French services sector taking on extra staff to the greatest extent since 2008 as UK based firms look to become less London centric. Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex, also fears that Britain is heading into recession. \u201cThe first clear evidence of the economic damage done by the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU was shown today. The Flash UK Services PMI missed the target by some distance, posting a worrying 47.4 \u2013 far lower than the 49 expected by economists. \u201cThe figure was the worst since April 2009, when the country was still shaken by the fallout from the global financial crisis. Chris Leslie MP, a former shadow chancellor, has called for MPs on both sides of the House of Commons to pay attention to the PMI survey: This chart shows just how quickly the UK economy has gone into reverse this month; in the biggest one-month fall ever: (50 is the cut-off point between growth and contraction) Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the UK PMI survey is \u201ctruly abysmal\u201d, and suggests that the EU referendum vote has - as feared - hit the economy. \u201cToday\u2019s super-weak PMI is the first hard evidence that Brexit has already had an impact on the UK economy. There was a sharp fall in activity in July and it now looks like the Bank of England has the data it needs to launch fresh easing at its next meeting at the start of August. Quite simply, the UK economy contracted at the fastest pace since the start of 2009, when the global financial crisis plunged us into recession. The readings suggest we are heading for a recession again and it is almost certain the BoE will pull the trigger on aggressive stimulus to boost aggregate demand. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says today\u2019s PMI report is \u2018woeful\u2019, and should prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates. Rupert Harrison of investment management group Blackrock is also concerned (Harrison is a former advisor to chancellor George Osborne) Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever says Britain appears to be heading into recession: The pound has fallen by over half a cent against the US dollar, as traders react to the news that Britain\u2019s economy appears to be shrinking. It\u2019s dropped from $1.323 to $1.317. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says Markit\u2019s report paints a pretty worrying picture. He also warns that the weak pound has driven up the cost of imported materials: \u201cThe UK economy has suffered sharp falls in output and new orders following the EU referendum as uncertainty has taken hold. The overall pace of decline was the strongest since early-2009. \u201cWeaker sterling has driven a steep rise in input prices for manufacturers but there is a glimmer of positivity with the new exchange rate encouraging a rise in export orders. However, with a subdued global economy, it is not yet clear whether these opportunities will materialise in the long term. This chart shows how British services and manufacturing have both suffered a plunge in output this month: Breaking: Britain\u2019s economy is shrinking at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, as the Brexit vote hits confidence and spending. Data firm Markit reports that services and manufacturing sectors have both suffered a big hit this month. They are contracting at the fastest pace since 2009, as output and new orders fall across the sector. Many firms blamed uncertainty caused by June\u2019s EU referendum. It suggests that the UK economy is shrinking, at a quarterly rate of 0.4%. Markit economist Chris Williamson says: \u201cJuly saw a dramatic deterioration in the economy, with business activity slumping at the fastest rate since the height of the global financial crisis in early-2009. \u201cThe downturn, whether manifesting itself in order book cancellations, a lack of new orders or the postponement or halting of projects, was most commonly attributed in one way or another to \u2018Brexit\u2019. Here\u2019s the details (any reading below 50 shows a contraction): Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index at 47.7 (52.4 in June). 87-month low. Flash UK Services PMI Activity Index at 47.4 (52.3 in June). 88-month low. Flash UK Manufacturing PMI at 49.1 (52.1 in June). 41-month low. Flash UK Manufacturing PMI Output Index at 49.1 (52.9 in June). 40-month low. Reaction to follow.... The City is on tenterhooks, as we await Markit\u2019s first healthcheck on the UK economy since the Brexit vote.... Despite Germany\u2019s robust performance, eurozone growth has edged down to its lowest in one-and-a-half year low in July. That\u2019s the verdict from Markit\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 assessment of the euro economy, which has dropped to 52.9 this month from 53.1 in June. That still shows growth, but at the slowest rate since January 2015. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson says the eurozone was \u201csurprisingly resilient\u201d, but is concerned that the Brexit vote has caused some damage: Business confidence about the outlook in the service sector has deteriorated to the worst for just over one-and-a-half years, linked primarily to the political and economic instability induced by the UK referendum, pointing to near-term downside risks for an already-lacklustre eurozone economy. \u201cPolicymakers will be reassured by the resilience of the PMI in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the fragility of the recovery leaves plenty of room for speculation about further stimulus later in the year.\u201d Economist Rupert Seggins shows the key points: UK property company shares are sliding this morning. Upmarket London estate agent Foxtons have shed almost 5%, and rival real estate firm Countrywide have tumbled almost 8%. That\u2019s partly due to LSL Property\u2019s Brexit-induced profit warning this morning. But it\u2019s also triggered by a survey from Hometrack, showing that London will bear the brunt of the property slowdown. Back in the UK.... supermarket chain Sainsbury has been given the green light to take control of the Argos chain. Here\u2019s an audio clip of chancellor Philip Hammond revealing that he might \u2018reset\u2019 UK fiscal policy this autumn. Thanks to my colleague Matthew Weaver, who is running our Politics Live blog today: This morning\u2019s economic data is a case of \u2018so far, so good\u2019, with Germany\u2019s private sector growing at its fastest pace this year. Germany\u2019s private sector has shrugged off the Brexit shock. Market\u2019s German PMI reports, just released, show that manufacturers and service companies kept growing this month - faster than expected. Ouch! Shares in UK property firm LSL have slumped by a fifth after it warned that the Brexit vote will hit its profits this year. LSL, which owns the Your Move chain, has told the City that trading slowed in the run-up to the referendum, and has worsened since as consumer uncertainty has increased. It no longer expects to hit its targets this year, and warns that full year group operating profit will be \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than previously expected. Shares have tumbled by 21% in early trading. The first of today\u2019s PMI surveys are out...and they show that France\u2019s private sector was flat this month, after shrinking a little in June. The French composite PMI rose to 50.0in July - the point separating expansion and contraction - up from 49.6 in June. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson says it\u2019s a decent figure, given everything France has been through recently: \u201cIn the face of the terrorist attack [in Nice] and the Brexit vote, to have the index coming up to 50.0 in a stable economy is perhaps a good result.\u201d Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics fears that today\u2019s UK PMIs will show Britain\u2019s economy is contracting this month. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has called for the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s Brexit vote to be removed as soon as possible. Speaking to reporters after meeting China\u2019s Premier Li Keqiang, Lagarde also blamed the EU referendum for making the IMF downgrade its global growth forecasts this week. Chancellor Philip Hammond has dropped a clear hint that he\u2019ll tear up his predecessor\u2019s tax and spending plans. During his first overseas visit since becoming Britain\u2019s finance minister, Hammond said that he might have to \u201creset\u201d fiscal policy when he delivers the autumn statement later this year. The scale of such a \u2018reset\u2019 will depend on how Britain\u2019s economy responds to the Brexit vote. George Osborne\u2019s goal of a budget surplus by the end of the parliament already appears doomed. Hammond is planning to use his China trip to promote British business opportunities, especially the City. He\u2019ll be telling his hosts that Britain is still open for business. We\u2019ll get the first clear glimpse of how Britain\u2019s economy has fared since the EU referendum this morning. Markit\u2019s Purchasing Managers Index survey, due at 9.30am, will show if UK manufacturers, construction firms and services companies expanded or contracted in the last few weeks. The PMI measures activity, output and employment levels, and economists fear they will show the UK economy took a hit after the surprise win for the Leave campaign. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explains: Markit is releasing a special one-off \u2018flash\u2019 version of the July UK PMIs today based on ~70% of the normal responses. The UK PMIs were already drifting lower even ahead of the referendum. Now they are expected to dip below the breakeven level of 50. In the case of services, that would be the first contractionary reading since late 2012. But...the initial response may evolve as respondents get more political certainty. We will need to see the August PMI surveys in early September to get a more definitive view of the impact on UK activity. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group warns that the pound could take a hit, if he PMIs are disappointing: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s lots on the agenda to keep us busy today. First up, MPs have delivered a withering verdict on Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct empire, warning that conditions are more suited to a Victorian workhouse than a 21st century retail chain. Eight months after a Guardian investigation, the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee concluded that Ashley treated his workers like commodities, not human beings. They condemned the company\u2019s \u2018six strikes and you\u2019re out\u2019 policy, and the use of thousands of zero-hour contracts which left staff in a precarious state. It\u2019s a pretty devastating verdict on Ashley, who admitted to MPs last month that Sports Direct had failed to pay the minimum wage due to searching staff in their own time. Luke Primarolo, the regional officer at Unite, says other companies have lessons to learn too: \u201cSports Direct is by no means the only company to engage people on such terms. What this highlights is a wider issue of real work today. The government needs to seriously consider what legislation needs to be put in place to protect people from exploitation.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Second, finance ministers and central bankers have headed to China for a G20 meeting. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union will be high on the agenda. Philip Hammond, the UK\u2019s new chancellor, is holding meetings with his Chinese counterparts right now. Thirdly, we get new PMI surveys showing the state of the European economy this month. Excitingly, this will include a rare \u2018flash\u2019 assessment of Britain\u2019s private sector in the first few weeks after the Brexit vote. Here\u2019s the timings: 8am: French flash PMI for July 9.30am: German flash PMI for July 9am: Eurozone flash PMI for July 9.30am: UK flash PMI for July European markets are expected to take a breather, as investors ponder whether central banks will deliver more stimulus to fight a downturn.",

The first big snapshot of the UK economy in the weeks immediately after Brexit is not one of those. As expected, there has been a heavy blow to confidence and activity in the weeks after the referendum on 23 June. Few companies were expecting the UK to decide to leave the EU and even fewer had a contingency plan for such an eventuality. In truth, the immediate hit to the economy is probably even more serious than suggested by the survey from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. That\u2019s because it excludes construction, where projects can be mothballed quickly. This sector looks especially vulnerable in the post-Brexit world. Of the two sectors covered by the flash estimate, services have taken a bigger hit than manufacturing. Again, that\u2019s unsurprising. Manufacturers will see the impact of Brexit cushioned by the fall in the value of the pound, which makes exports cheaper. What\u2019s more, in the event that Britain cannot negotiate continued membership of the single market, EU tariffs on UK manufactured goods would be small. For the service sector, however, it is a different story. It would be quite possible for the EU to impose quite tough barriers on UK service sector exports, and this is of deep concern, particularly to the City. The abrupt and large fall in both orders and output reported by IHS Markit and the CIPS clearly makes a recession in the second half of 2016 a real risk. Similar results for August and September would suggest a 0.4% contraction in the economy in the third quarter. It only takes two successive quarters of contraction to constitute a technical recession. There is a possibility, of course, that July will mark the depths of post-Brexit anxiety among business, and there have been a few positive signs. A new government has been formed that is taking its time about triggering the start of the UK\u2019s divorce proceedings from the EU. Consumers still seem to be spending in the shops. But the Bank of England will be taking no chances. Members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee wanted more evidence when they met earlier this month before sanctioning new measures to stimulate growth. Now they have it. The Bank\u2019s approach has been to exude calm reassurance that it is in control of events. But it is going to take more than words to prevent the economy sliding into recession, and most MPC members seem to understand that.

In an unscheduled trading update, LSL Property Services, whose brands include Your Move and Marsh &amp; Parsons, said business slowed in the run-up to the referendum on 23 June and had deteriorated since. LSL said it had a strong first three months of the year as buyers snapped up properties before stamp duty increases in April. But business slowed in the second quarter as the referendum approached and potential buyers and sellers became wary. The company said: \u201cThe EU referendum outcome has led to further consumer uncertainty and LSL\u2019s post-referendum trading performance has reflected these market conditions. LSL now expects that full-year group operating profit will be significantly lower than previously anticipated.\u201d Analysts\u2019 average forecast before the profit warning was for annual operating profit to increase to \u00a346m, from \u00a342.9m a year earlier. Jefferies, LSL\u2019s house broker, cut its estimate to \u00a335.5m. The company\u2019s shares plunged 21% in early trading and at 9.30am were down 7% to 230p \u2013 their lowest since November 2012. Rivals Countrywide were down 7% and Foxtons was off more than 4%. LSL\u2019s profit warning follows a similarly gloomy update from Foxtons soon after the referendum. The London-focused estate agent predicted concerns about Brexit would depress London property sales for the rest of this year. The warnings underline the effect of the referendum on the UK property market. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has reported three straight months of falling buyer enquiries and predicts the number of homes changing hands will slump over the summer. Estate agents and surveyors are more pessimistic than at any time since the late 90s. LSL bought the upmarket chain Marsh &amp; Parsons, founded by the former Foxtons managing director Peter Rollings, in 2011 to expand in the central London market. In March, it described business in central London as challenging and said there had been no pickup after last year\u2019s election. Asking prices are falling sharply in London and some analysts have argued the vote for Brexit could be the catalyst to burst a bubble that has caused prices to double. Analysts at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said last week that prices could halve in London\u2019s most expensive boroughs if senior City managers are forced to relocate outside the UK.",

Marks &amp; Spencer is the biggest faller, down 8.2p or 2.5% to 320.3p as analysts at Barclays cut their recommendation from equal weight to underweight and slashed their price target from 410p to 290p on worries about falling like for like sales and earnings, and rising costs. They said: The new management team\u2019s strategy of focusing on customers and product may be the start of a turnaround story, but things can get worse before they get better. We expect a painful transition and material earnings per share downgrades. We view the price cuts in clothing lines as an essential but mostly corrective action that could keep general merchandise like for likes deep in negative territory in 2017 and 2018. We expect the strong appreciation of the US dollar and higher cotton prices to have a 130 basis points negative impact in 2018 gross margin, adding to the pressure, while investment in service does not leave much room for cost cutting. We don\u2019t see material downside risk to M&amp;S\u2019s multiple but we have cut our 2018 earnings per share estimate by 20% and are now 17% below Reuters consensus. November\u2019s strategy update may include positive news on the simplification of the clothing sub-brands, the rationalization of M&amp;S\u2019s international business and better use of the company\u2019s store estate. While we expect this to be positive in the longer term, it is unlikely to have a positive impact on earnings over the next two years. We find the current low visibility on earnins per share unappealing and without signs of stabilisation in consumer confidence we see any rerating as unlikely. We expect general merchandise like for likes down 5% in 2017 and down 2% in 2018. This is 2-3 percentage points below our previous estimate as we expect volume growth to only partially offset price investment while less discounting will likely hurt demand, especially online. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 25.10 points to 6674.79, with the decline accelerating on poor UK purchasing manager numbers. Mining shares are also in decline again as metal prices ease, with Rio Tinto down 33p at \u00a323.44 and BHP Billiton 13.9p lower at 925.3p. There are some notable risers. Vodafone is up nearly 4% at 233.4p after first half revenues rose by a better than expected 2.2% increase. Irish building materials group CRH has climbed 63p to \u00a322.58 as it raised its first half profit forecast from \u20ac1bn to \u20ac1.1bn. Russ Mould, investment director at broker AJ Bell said: The improvement comes thanks to strong trading in the latter part of the second quarter.

      "bodyText": "The competition regulator has approved the Sainsbury\u2019s \u00a31.4bn takeover of Home Retail Group, which owns Argos, clearing the way for the supermarket chain to become Britain\u2019s biggest seller of general goods. The Competition and Markets Authority said that after an initial review, it had decided not to refer the deal to an advanced, phase-two inquiry. The decision spares Sainsbury\u2019s months of delays and potential costs of millions of pounds. The CMA said in late May it was considering an investigation into the takeover, which was agreed between the two companies in April. The regulator set a deadline of 13 June for comments about the deal\u2019s likely effect on consumers and had until 25 July to decide whether to hold an inquiry. Sainsbury\u2019s is buying Argos to broaden its product range, reduce its reliance on the highly competitive grocery market and acquire Argos\u2019s online delivery business. Sainsbury\u2019s will put Argos stores into its supermarkets, adding to its own range of homeware and other non-food goods. The CMA said in May it would judge \u201cwhether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s said at the time it had expected the CMA to look at the deal but that it believed the takeover would be passed. The CMA surprised the retail industry last year by subjecting Poundland\u2019s takeover of 99p Stores to a full inquiry, before withdrawing early objections and clearing the deal. Home Retail and Sainsbury\u2019s said they were pleased with the CMA\u2019s decision. The deal will go to Home Retail shareholders for approval at a meeting on 27 July. The CMA said it would publish more information on its decision next month.",

      "bodyText": "Running an airline has always been a volatile game. Fixed overheads are heavy and profit margins can be clobbered by events and sudden dips in demand. It has always been so. If easyJet\u2019s shareholders, after a wonderful run over the past half-decade, thought the old rules had been suspended, they have had to think again. The company, in common with most of its direct rivals, has lost a third of its stock market value since the EU referendum. The vote for Brexit is not the sole cause, of course. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, started her review of the past quarter with a statement of the obvious. \u201cThe economic and operating environment has been difficult \u2026\u201d You bet. Two-thirds of easyJet\u2019s flights pass through France and the air traffic controllers there have been striking with extra enthusiasm this summer. Meanwhile, the Brussels terror attack and the Egyptair tragedy has been followed by the horror in Nice and the attempted coup in Turkey. All sap consumer confidence, at least for a while. EasyJet\u2019s revenue per seat was down 8.3% in the third quarter and is unlikely to improve meaningfully in the short term. But is the UK\u2019s vote for Brexit really as significant as the share price suggests? UK consumers will have to adapt to a weaker pound, it\u2019s true. Some will be more inclined to take a holiday at home. And the exchange rate movement makes fuel, which is denominated in dollars and is the airline\u2019s biggest cost, more expensive. But investors\u2019 prime Brexit-related worry has been more basic: regulation. EasyJet, like Ryanair, is a child of the European common aviation area, which allows airlines to operate from any EU airport. If automatic flying rights are threatened, or become harder to secure, does the business model need a complete overhaul? It\u2019s an uncertainty \u2013 but the threat is probably overstated. First, the most likely outcome of the UK\u2019s negotiation with the rest of the EU is that flying rights will continue as before. Continental airlines and airports are not lobbying for easyJet to be excluded. It is in neither side\u2019s interest to rip up a system that has produced clear benefits for consumers. Second, easyJet has a plan B, which is to obtain an airline operator certificate in an EU country. That, in theory, ought to be a relatively painless process since easyJet has a large operation within the non-UK EU. It flies Spaniards to Germany, for example, and operates internal flights within France. In practice, life could turn out to be complicated once the politicians sit at the bargaining table. But, as matters stand, the regulatory risks from Brexit should be slight. The current \u201cdifficult\u201d operating climate, on the other hand, looks very real. William Hill chief pays penalty for bookmaker\u2019s troubles Gareth Davis is a no-nonsense chairman of the old school, which is one reason why nobody in the City is remotely bothered about him heading three companies simultaneously \u2013 bookmaker William Hill; FTSE 100 builders merchant Wolseley; and DS Smith, Europe\u2019s leading packaging company. James Henderson, chief executive of William Hill until Wednesday night, can now testify to what no-nonsense means. After only two years in the post, Henderson is out of his job. He is paying the penalty for William Hill\u2019s struggles with an upgrade of its online and mobile technology. Is that harsh on a man with 31 years of service on the clock? Not really. There was no fresh profits warning on Thursday, to follow March\u2019s thumper, but a board is obliged to take a longer view. William Hill had grown used to comfortable market leadership in the UK, but now sees its rivals combining dangerously. PaddyPower and Betfair have merged and Ladbrokes and Gala Coral are doing the same. If William Hill\u2019s online growth has stalled, its board can\u2019t afford to be sentimental. Sports Direct\u2019s problems are extreme but not unique Mike Ashley cannot grumble with the damning verdict of the business, innovation and skills select committee: he is accountable for the \u201cappalling\u201d working practices at Sports Direct. On his own admission, he is responsible for what goes on at a company he founded and still controls: either he should have known, or else he turned a blind eye. But committee chair Iain Wright, in his article for this paper, is right to say the problems at Sports Direct may be an extreme example but are probably not unique. The so-called \u201cgig\u201d economy is stretching the link between employer and employee to breaking point. The growth in self-employed, temporary and zero-hours jobs has created the conditions for abuse of workers. If the trend conditions, Wright argues, the government will look again at the employment laws. Bring it on.",
