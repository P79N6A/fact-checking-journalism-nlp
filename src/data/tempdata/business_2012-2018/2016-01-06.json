      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s largest shareholder, the Qatari Investment Authority, has expressed unease about the retailer\u2019s \u00a31bn bid for Home Retail Group and may be prepared to block a deal. On Tuesday, Sainsbury\u2019s revealed that it had approached the Argos and Homebase owner with a cash-and-shares takeover bid in November. The offer was rejected last month, but Sainsbury\u2019s has until 2 February to consider whether it will make a new offer or walk away. However, it is understood that the QIA, which owns a 25.1% stake in Sainsbury\u2019s, does not want its shareholding in the retailer to be diminished or to pour more money into new shares to help fund a deal. If Sainsbury\u2019s makes a cash-and-shares bid for Home Retail Group it would need to issue new shares, forcing the QIA, an investment firm founded by the state of Qatar, to buy more stock to keep its stake at 25%. Sources said the QIA was unhappy that it had not been fully consulted about the bid for Home Retail Group, and that relations between the investor and the supermarket had cooled since the departure of the former chief executive Justin King in July 2014. However, if the investment firm\u2019s concerns about the dilution of its stake in Sainsbury\u2019s could be satisfied, it may yet back a deal. If the value of the bid for Home Retail Group from Sainsbury\u2019s is worth more than a quarter of the supermarket\u2019s stock market value, it would require shareholder approval. In that case, the Qataris, who took control of Canary Wharf last year but are otherwise diversifying outside Europe, would be in a strong position to block a deal should they want to. Even if a deal did not need the support of shareholders, any opposition from the retailer\u2019s largest shareholder would make a transaction politically difficult to pull off. It is understood that the founding Sainsbury family is supportive of the management, but its combined stake is now only about 3%. On Wednesday, shareholders in Home Retail Group expressed differing views about the company\u2019s decision to reject the Sainsbury\u2019s approach outright without consulting them first. Martin Hughes, the founder of Toscafund, which owns 5% of Home Retail Group, said: \u201cLeading shareholders of Home Retail are sympathetic to Sainsbury\u2019s approach. They are unhappy the board of Home Retail did not consult prior to rejection.\u201d Another shareholder, Schroders, is also reportedly unhappy about the lack of consultation. However, Richard Buxton of Old Mutual, which owns 4.9% of Home Retail Group, said the company\u2019s board was right to have rejected the Sainsbury\u2019s bid. \u201cThis was an opportunistic approach just after the October profit warning and ahead of a key trading period when the share price was low. No way should the board have consulted shareholders,\u201d he said. Buxton said Home Retail was three years into a five- to six-year transformation programme that could see profitability dramatically improve. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s can\u2019t come in just when a lot of the hard work has been done,\u201d he said. \u201cHome Retail has got a strong balance sheet that can fund this transformation. Sainsbury\u2019s does not.\u201d Shares in Home Retail Group, which rose by 41% on Tuesday to 139.3p after the supermarket put out a statement, fell to 132.4p on Wednesday as investors awaited further developments. Sainsbury\u2019s statement to the stock market this week was prompted by an early morning spike in Home Retail Group\u2019s share price. Trading in its shares ahead of the Sainsbury\u2019s statement is likely to be examined by the City watchdog. It has emerged that the November approach came from the Sainsbury\u2019s chairman, David Tyler, to John Coombe, his opposite number at Home Retail Group. Tyler\u2019s close involvement in the deal is no surprise. The Sainsbury\u2019s chairman was finance director of GUS, which previously owned Home Retail Group. He was closely involved in GUS\u2019s acquisition of Homebase from private equity firm Permira and Sainsbury\u2019s for \u00a3900m in 2002. Sainsbury\u2019s share price has fallen by about 5% since it announced its bid for Home Retail, as analysts and investors remain sceptical about the benefits of a deal. Analysts at Exane said they were concerned that Argos faces structural challenges, with sales 5% lower today than five years ago. \u201cAs such, we\u2019d rather Sainsbury\u2019s focuses on grocery and its core estate,\u201d they said.",

No way should the board have consulted shareholders,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Buxton said Home Retail was three years into a five- to six-year transformation programme that could see profitability dramatically improve. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s can\u2019t come in just when a lot of the hard work has been done,\u201d he said. \u201cHome Retail has got a strong balance sheet that can fund this transformation. Sainsbury\u2019s does not.\u201d</p> <p>Shares in Home Retail Group, which rose by 41% on Tuesday to 139.3p after the supermarket put out a statement, fell to 132.4p on Wednesday as investors awaited further developments.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s statement to the stock market this week was prompted by an early morning spike in Home Retail Group\u2019s share price. Trading in its shares ahead of the Sainsbury\u2019s statement is likely to be examined by the City watchdog.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/05/argos-story-green-shield-stamps-tesco-sainsburys\">The Argos story: from Green Shield Stamps via Tesco and now Sainsbury's?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has emerged that the November approach came from the Sainsbury\u2019s chairman, David Tyler, to John Coombe, his opposite number at Home Retail Group.</p> <p>Tyler\u2019s close involvement in the deal is no surprise.

      "bodyText": "The risk of the global economy being battered by a \u201cperfect storm\u201d in 2016 has been highlighted by the World Bank in a flagship report that warns that a synchronised slowdown in the biggest emerging markets could be intensified by a fresh bout of financial turmoil. The Bank said the possibility that Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 the so-called Brics economies \u2013 could all face problems simultaneously would put in jeopardy the chances of a pick-up in growth in the coming year. It added that the impact would be heightened by severe financial market stress of the sort triggered in 2013 by the announcement by the Federal Reserve that it was considering reducing the stimulus it was then providing to the US economy. Launching its annual Global Economic Prospects, the Bank said activity in 2015 had failed to live up to its expectations \u2013 the fifth year in a row that growth has undershot the forecasts made by the Washington-based institution, which lends to the world\u2019s poorest countries. The Bank said growth had slowed to 2.4% in 2015, from 2.6% in 2014, but added that a stronger performance in developed countries should lead to 2.9% growth this year. \u201cDownside risks dominate and have become increasingly centred on emerging and developing countries,\u201d it said. The Bank is predicting that recessions in Brazil and Russia will bottom out in 2016, that China will experience only a modest growth slowdown from 6.9% to 6.7% and that India will continue to expand at a robust pace. The report said that, in a development unmatched since the 1980s, most of the largest emerging market economies were slowing at the same time. Sharp declines in commodity prices, subdued global trade, weaker capital flows and currency pressures had combined last year to create a \u201cparticularly challenging external environment for commodity exporters\u201d, where most of the growth slowdown had occurred. The Bank has estimated that growth in developing countries reached a post-crisis low of 4.2% in 2015, down from 4.9% in 2014, and warned that 2016 could be another difficult year. In the event that growth in the Brics economies fell one percentage point short of expectations, the Bank said this would knock 0.8 points off growth in other emerging markets and reduce growth in the global economy by 0.4%. But the Bank also highlighted the risks of what it called a perfect storm. \u201cSpillovers could be considerably larger if the Brics growth slowdown were combined with financial market stress. \u201cIf, in 2016, Brics growth slows further, by as much as the average growth disappointment over 2010-14, growth in other emerging markets could fall short of expectations by about one percentage point and global growth by 0.7 percentage points. \u201cIf such a Brics growth decline scenario were to be combined with financial sector turbulence, emerging market growth could slow by an additional 0.5 percentage points and global growth by an additional 0.4 percentage points.\u201d Jim Yong Kim, the Bank\u2019s president, said: \u201cMore than 40% of the world\u2019s poor live in the developing countries where growth slowed in 2015. Developing countries should focus on building resilience to a weaker economic environment and shielding the most vulnerable. The benefits from reforms to governance and business conditions are potentially large and could help offset the effects of slow growth in larger economies.\u201d The Bank said it expected the growth rate in the Middle East and North Africa region to more than double as a result of the ending of sanctions against Iran and an end to declining oil prices. \u201cGrowth is forecast to accelerate to 5.1% in 2016 from 2.5% in the year just ended, as the expected suspension or removal of economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran will allow that country to play a larger role in global energy markets. Growth is expected to pick up in other oil exporters as well, predominantly on the assumption that oil prices will stabilize.\u201d More stable commodity prices should also help Africa, the Bank added, predicting growth to pick up from 3.4% in 2015 to 4.2% in 2016.",

Sales rose nearly 7% in the six weeks to 2 January, as shoppers clicked up 31% more sales via smartphones and tablet computers. Despite fears of a fashion meltdown during an unseasonably warm autumn and winter, John Lewis increased sales of clothing and beauty products by about 6%. That growth was largely a result of strong demand online which accounted for 40% of the chain\u2019s total sales over the period. But analysts estimated that underlying sales at physical stores were down by about 3% as shoppers preferred buying from the sofa to the high street. The department store\u2019s performance was in stark contrast to the group\u2019s Waitrose supermarket chain, where sales at established stores fell 1.4% amid a wave of price cuts in the grocery market. Total sales rose 1.4% to \u00a3859.8m as online sales increased nearly 8%. The upmarket grocer said it enjoyed record trading days on 22, 23 and 24 December as shoppers left stocking up for the festive celebrations later than ever. But industry-wide price deflation of 1.7%-2%, as a result of falling commodity prices and retailers battling over the price of essentials and seasonal favourites hit the value of sales. Mark Price, the outgoing managing director of Waitrose, said: \u201cThere was a lot of price deflation and customers were buying more on promotion. There were a lot of offers out there so it was hard to make top line progress but I think all the numbers will show we won market share over Christmas.\u201d Price said Waitrose had increased the number of items it sold and attracted more shoppers and added that he believed the business had enjoyed a more profitable Christmas this year despite the disappointing sales figures. Andy Street, managing director of John Lewis, said he believed the department store had taken market share because as its heavy investment in distribution and IT systems meant it was seen as a reliable option by shoppers. \u201cAll the signs are that we dramatically out-performed the market,\u201d Street said, because the late rush had increased the pace of sales growth from 3.5% in November to nearly 7% over the six weeks to 2 January. \u201cPeople were ordering online in huge quantities even on the Monday and Tuesday before Christmas,\u201d he added. On Tuesday, Next cut its profit guidance after the warmest December on record hit sales at the fashion and homewares retailer. A fall in the number of high street shoppers after Christmas suggested big discounts were failing to lure people into stores. At John Lewis, homewares rose 5% and electrical goods up nearly 10%, driven by sales of hi-tech gadgets including Apple Watches, the new iPad Pro and Nutribullet blenders. Menswear sales rose 8% while Star Wars Lego was another strong seller. Street said: \u201cChristmas gives retail brands momentum or sadly for some it doesn\u2019t. We will go into 2016 with great momentum and I am expecting to grow our sales in this coming year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The price of a barrel of Brent crude fell below $35 on Wednesday for the first time since 2004, a remarkable event given that the global economy, while plainly not red hot, is several degrees above lukewarm. Even after the banking crash of 2008, and the global recession that followed, oil only briefly traded below $40 a barrel. So, you would assume, a rebound in prices must lie around the next corner, just as the Opec cartel and oil company chiefs keep telling us. One of these days \u2013 or months, or years \u2013 those predictions of more expensive oil will be proved correct. Today\u2019s glut of supplies always becomes tomorrow\u2019s shortage as exploration and production budgets are slashed and low prices stimulate demand. The question, however, is when that day arrives. The guess here is that it\u2019s still some way off. In the short-term, sub-$30 oil seems a real possibility. First, almost nobody has stopped pumping the stuff. Opec is in disarray and unable to agree on production quotas. Instead, it is obliged to march to the Saudis\u2019 apparent policy of trying to break the US shale industry. So far, that strategy has yielded next to nothing. Overall, US oil production continues to rise and the US shale producers have shown that they cut costs like everybody else. It\u2019s true that exploration is slowing down, but actual production volumes matter more in the short-term. Second, the old assumption that a surge in tensions in the Middle East implies higher oil prices probably doesn\u2019t apply this time. Saudi Arabia and Iran are at diplomatic loggerheads but the effect on supplies may be zero. Iran doesn\u2019t want to imperil its return to world oil markets when sanctions are lifted this year, as seems likely. The Saudis don\u2019t want to cede market share to an economic rival. Third, the real state of the Chinese economy is a mystery to most outsiders but almost every piece of the data in the past year points to a slowdown that\u2019s sharper than the official statistics imply. Then there\u2019s a potential joker in the pack from the US economy. Has the Federal Reserve started raising rates just as the business cycles turns down? It\u2019s a possibility. In short, then, there are few reasons to believe oil supplies are about to reduce in coming months and a couple of reasons to think demand could falter. And this is at a moment when the world is running out of places to store current stockpiles of oil. Sub-$30 wouldn\u2019t last for long, one suspects. But, until the Saudis decide they\u2019ve had enough of these prices, it\u2019s hard to see what will alter the current plotline. At the moment, Saudi Arabia isn\u2019t even trying to talk up prices, let alone curbing production. Shelling out to save face How goes Shell\u2019s planned \u00a336bn purchase of BG Group in this climate? Logically, you\u2019d think the deal would be dead in the water since the terms were negotiated last April, when a barrel of Brent fetched $65. As every can investor can see, BG\u2019s shareholders are getting the better end of this transaction, and then some. If the talks were happening today, the Shell chief executive, Ben van Beurden, would not dream of offering 383p in cash plus shares currently worth 670p, the terms on which its shareholders will vote on later this month. That \u00a310.53-a-share offer compares to BG\u2019s share price a year ago of 800p, which might be 700p-ish today without a bid on the table. The remarkable fact, however, is that protests from Shell\u2019s shareholders about an apparent giveaway of billions of pounds of value haven\u2019t risen above murmuring from the likes of David Cumming at Standard Life. Why not? Some fund managers own both stocks, so can take the view that what they lose on Shell they gain on BG. Others may be persuaded by Shell\u2019s argument that it has spotted extra savings and the cash arithmetic now works once oil returns to $50, rather than the $70 figure cited at the outset. But one suspects that the main explanation for fund managers\u2019 near-silence is Shell\u2019s status as a global titan whose board cannot be embarrassed into seeking a last-minute renegotiation of terms. That is depressing. Fund managers are not paid to be poodles. Priory purchase brings policy problem If Labour MPs ever tire of internal squabbling and decide to return to day-to-day politics, here\u2019s a deal to complain about: the purchase of Priory Group, the chain of private hospitals, by Acadia Healthcare of the US. The deal, unveiled earlier this week, is worth \u00a31.28bn plus shares worth \u00a3230m and looks very good point of the view of the seller, private equity group Advent International. But it raises competition issues \u2013 and public policy questions \u2013 that are being ignored. Acadia already owns Partnerships in Care in the UK, a rival to Priory, which it bought for almost \u00a3400m in June 2014. After the latest acquisition, Acadia will control about 50% of the independent \u2013 or non-NHS \u2013 market for psychiatric care in the UK. What\u2019s the problem, it might be argued, won\u2019t the NHS still dominate the market? Well, yes, but the NHS is also obliged to buy mental health services from outside when it can\u2019t cope with demand itself. There would seem to be a real risk that the NHS ends up outsourcing to a highly concentrated market where it lacks pricing power. No wonder Acadia\u2019s chief executive, Joey Jacobs, likes the \u201cfavourable industry dynamics\u201d in the UK. If the opposition can\u2019t see the potential problem, the Competition and Markets Authority should. Indeed, one hopes alarm bells are already ringing at the competition regulator.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/06/oil-prices-crash-to-11-year-low\">The price of a barrel of Brent crude fell below $35 on Wednesday for the first time since 2004</a>, a remarkable event given that the global economy, while plainly not red hot, is several degrees above lukewarm. Even after the banking crash of 2008, and the global recession that followed, oil only briefly traded below $40 a barrel. So, you would assume, a rebound in prices must lie around the next corner, just as the Opec cartel and oil company chiefs keep telling us.</p> <p>One of these days \u2013 or months, or years \u2013 those predictions of more expensive oil will be proved correct. Today\u2019s glut of supplies always becomes tomorrow\u2019s shortage as exploration and production budgets are slashed and low prices stimulate demand. The question, however, is when that day arrives. The guess here is that it\u2019s still some way off. In the short-term, sub-$30 oil seems a real possibility.</p> <p>First, almost nobody has stopped pumping the stuff. Opec is in disarray and unable to agree on production quotas. Instead, it is obliged to march to the Saudis\u2019 apparent policy of trying to break the US shale industry. So far, that strategy has yielded next to nothing. Overall, US oil production continues to rise and the US shale producers have shown that they cut costs like everybody else. It\u2019s true that exploration is slowing down, but actual production volumes matter more in the short-term.</p> <p>Second, the old assumption that a surge in tensions in the Middle East implies higher oil prices probably doesn\u2019t apply this time.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has begun a trial scheme to increase the size of its food halls and cut back on the space it devotes to fashion as its clothing sales continue to slump. The retailer has already lined up eight stores where it will increase the amount of floorspace for its upmarket food range over the next six months. It is now examining how many more could be rejigged to bolster its struggling sales and profit performance. The strategy is being developed as M&amp;S is expected to reveal another dive in fashion sales over the key three months to 26 December. Sales from stores \u2013 rather than online \u2013 are expected to be down by as much as 10%. Online sales are expected to be up by as much as a third, as M&amp;S recovers from problems at the distribution centre for its internet business a year ago. With both stores and online taken into account, City analysts are expecting underlying sales of clothing to have fallen by 2%. It will be the third consecutive quarter of falling clothing sales \u2013 the M&amp;S has now had just one quarterly rise in five years. The retailer has struggled to compete with growing competition from rivals including Next and Debenhams, and fashion chains such as H&amp;M, Zara and New Look, where its once core \u201cmum and dad\u201d customers are now happy to shop. But the M&amp;S food business is thriving in a tough market. Food sales at its established stores are expected to have risen by as much as 1% over the three months to Boxing Day \u2013 putting M&amp;S well ahead of grocers such as Tesco and Morrisons. Well informed sources said M&amp;S had concluded that it devoted too much store space to clothing, especially as shoppers\u2019 shift towards buying online and the retailer continues to struggle to regain the broad family appeal it had in the 1980s. The food business, which currently does not offer home deliveries, is better protected from the switch to online shopping as its upmarket own-label products cannot be bought elsewhere. With food performing well, one source said there could be as many as 60 stores which had space for larger departments. The retailer\u2019s biggest stores have food departments as large as 16,000 sq ft (1,500 sq m) \u2013 the size of a small high street supermarket. But the average space devoted to food in its medium-sized stores is about 7,000 sq ft and it is understood that there are dozens which could be expanded by up to 30%. Fraser Ramzan, a retail analyst at Nomura, said: \u201cThe channel shift [towards online sales] in the most recent quarter does raise questions about what to do with store space longer term. Other retailers such as B&amp;Q and Debenhams have already addressed store space with concessions or closures. M&amp;S does have a decent alternative use for some of their spare space \u2013 food.\u201d About 10 years ago, M&amp;S cut back the amount of space devoted to food in a handful of stores. But the retailer is thought unlikely to simply unwind those changes One well-informed source said the retailer would have to consider a number of factors including the location, car-parking facilities, the spending power of the local community and level of competition in an area to judge the opportunity for expanding food space. \u201cEach store will have to be judged on its own merits with a lot of factors taken into consideration,\u201d said the source. \u201cClothing profit margins are much higher so they don\u2019t want to shrink clothing sales and find they don\u2019t make the money back on food.\u201d M&amp;S has already cut back the amount of space devoted to clothing in some stores by introducing cafes, restaurants, delis and dedicated areas for picking up goods bought online. One source who knows the retailer well said there was still further opportunity to expand cafes and takeaway food areas to reflect the rising trend in eating out and buying pre-prepared food. Retailers such as Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose and Tesco are already introducing more eateries and takeaway food areas to take advantage of the changing spending habits. Spending in restaurants and pubs rose 14.4% and nearly 10% respectively last year, according to credit and debit card provider Barclaycard, while food and drink shopping rose just 1%. With all the challenges it faces, Ramzan said M&amp;S not only needed to reassess its existing outlets but be more proactive in reshaping its store estate. The retailer closed 12 stores in the six months to November, nearly twice the number in the previous six months, and analysts said M&amp;S appeared to have stepped up action to move out of less popular shopping locations. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about closing stores but opening in the right places where, in an increasingly online world, people want to shop,\u201d Ramzan said. A spokeswoman for M&amp;S said the changes to store space were just business as usual and it had no plans to alter dozens of stores. The company has said it wants to keep the space devoted to clothing and homewares steady across the business and that was still the current plan. \u201cWe will move some space from GM [clothing and homeware] to food in eight stores over the next few months. This is part of our regular work to ensure every store has the best possible set up for our customers,\u201d she added.",

      "bodyText": "As many as 245 Argos shops could close if Sainsbury\u2019s secures a deal to buy Home Retail Group. Analysis for the Guardian by property agent Harper Dennis Hobbs shows that 245 Argos shops are within half a mile of at least one Sainsbury\u2019s store, meaning their future will be under threat if the supermarket chain agrees a takeover of Argos\u2019s parent company. Thousands of jobs would be lost if these stores were closed. Argos has 840 shops across the UK in total and employs around 30,000 people. Sainsbury\u2019s revealed on Tuesday that it had made an approach to buy Home Retail, which also owns DIY chain Homebase, and sources expect the company to return with another bid. The grocery retailer made clear in its statement that store closures would be likely if a deal happens. Sainsbury\u2019s said a combination of the two companies would provide \u201ccost synergy potential\u201d \u2013 which is City parlance for cost-cutting \u2013 through \u201cproperty rationalisation\u201d. In addition, Sainsbury\u2019s said it would \u201coptimise the use of their combined retail space\u201d. The company already has Argos concessions inside ten of its supermarkets. If a takeover is complete, Sainsbury\u2019s could open more Argos stores within its supermarkets and then close nearby Argos stores. Jonathan De Mello, head of retail consultancy at HDH, said: \u201cI definitely think they will need to close some of the Argos stores \u2013 they will need to quickly find ways to reduce costs. \u201cSelling Homebase as soon as possible would be one way of doing so, but maximising synergies where considerable store overlap exists is another. I don\u2019t think they will close all the stores where overlap exists, but certainly 100-plus would be very much \u2018at risk.\u2019\u201d Homebase has 296 stores across the UK. Analysts believe Sainsbury\u2019s would look to sell off the DIY chain after not mentioning Homebase in the statement revealing its approach to buy Home Retail. However, if it keeps Homebase then Sainsbury\u2019s could look to merge its products into nearby supermarkets and close existing sites. In late 2014, Home Retail announced it would close one quarter Homebase stores by February 2019. The prospect of Sainsbury\u2019s closing Argos stores is made even more likely by the leases running out on the catalogue retailer\u2019s stores. Data provided by Home Retail in its last financial results show that the lease on 55% of its shops will either expire or reach a break clause in the next five years. This means that Sainsbury\u2019s could close shops without having to pay any outstanding rent. Freddie George, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s, we suspect, would plan to dispose of Homebase and look to restructure the Argos estate, which has an average length of lease of under five years, with a focus on hub stores and concessions.\u201d A tie-up with Sainsbury\u2019s could help Argos to negotiate cheaper rents with its landlords, Bruno Montenye, analyst at stockbroker Bernstein, added. Monteyne said: \u201cArgos would suddenly be in a very strong negotiation position to either close the store and move the sales to a nearby Sainsbury\u2019s store and renegotiate rates with lease holders, using the threat of walking away and using a nearby store. It would only take a few tens of Argos store closures to put pressure on the leases of the 700 to 800 other leases.\u201d Shares in Home Retail, which rise 41% on Tuesday, fell back 5% on Wednesday, while Sainsbury\u2019s dropped by 0.4%.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of customers of Bradford &amp; Bingley face the prospect of having their mortgages sold off to another lender as the government prepares \u00a317bn of home loans for sale. The vast package of mortgages is in government hands because B&amp;B had to be rescued by taxpayers during the 2008 banking crisis. The mortgages could be sold off in parcels or as one giant bundle of loans. The potential sell-off follows the recent sale of \u00a313bn of Northern Rock mortgages which the government took over when the lender was nationalised in February 2008. The home loans of about 125,000 customers of the Newcastle-based lender were sold to US private equity company Cerberus Capital Management in November, prompting concerns that the terms and conditions of customers may be adversely affected. Following that sale, the chancellor, George Osborne, announced in his autumn statement that another \u00a37.5bn of mortgages could be sold off by UK Asset Resolution (Ukar), the body that looks after loans issued by Northern Rock and B&amp;B that are now owned by taxpayers. B&amp;B was a major buy-to-let lender before it ran into problems. It was split in two in September 2008, when the Treasury rescued about \u00a340bn of its troublesome loans and the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander took over its branches and savings customers. The \u00a317bn of B&amp;B mortgages now being considered for a possible sale would be in addition to those and further reduce the size of the balance sheet of Ukar, which stood at \u00a3115bn at the time of the bailout and is close to being halved. The loan from the taxpayer to keep the operation afloat has been cut by 30% to \u00a348.7bn. The latest sale is not certain but has been outlined in documents sent to investment bankers. Separately, the remaining stake in Lloyds Banking Group is also expected to sold off this year, partly through a move by Osborne to offer \u00a32bn of shares to the public at a discount. The government stake stood at 43% at the time of its bailout. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have proved more difficult to sell. The first chunk was sold in August at a \u00a31bn loss to reduce the taxpayer stake from 79% to just below 73%. Any sale of the \u00a317bn of B&amp;B mortgages is likely to be some months away as Ukar is has yet to complete the sell-off of the Northern Rock mortgages \u2013 known as the Granite portfolio \u2013 to Cerberus. It could also face scrutiny from MPs who are considering whether the sale to the private equity firm was in the public interest. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, has asked Harriett Baldwin, the economic secretary to the Treasury, for reassurance about the treatment of customers whose mortgages were sold.",

      "bodyText": "Global financial markets suffered a third day of new year turbulence after fresh fears over the health of China\u2019s economy and tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran sent the price of oil plummeting to its lowest level in more than a decade. In a move that motoring organisations said would trigger further cuts in petrol prices, the cost of Brent crude dropped by 5% during trading in London to stand at $34.60 (\u00a323.66) a barrel. Share prices were also down, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 closing 64 points lower at 6,073 and New York\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average dropping below the 17,000 level in early trading. Oil\u2019s slide began in east Asia, where Beijing\u2019s decision to allow its currency, the yuan, to weaken prompted concerns in financial markets that China\u2019s economy is performing much less strongly than suggested by official statistics. The selling then continued in Europe as dealers calculated that the tension between two of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers \u2013 Saudi Arabia and Iran \u2013 would prevent the Opec cartel from agreeing on production cuts that might stabilise prices by bringing supply into line with demand.

American output, which has surged in recent years, has remained relatively strong despite oil prices falling from their $115 peak in June 2014. The growing rapprochement between the west and Iran has increased the likelihood of a huge rise in Iranian crude exports just as Iraq and other countries are ramping up output. This has influenced price makers more than the growing standoff between Saudi Arabia and Iran over the recent execution of a Shia Muslim cleric and the terrorist attacks on Libyan oil storage tanks. The tumbling oil price has made refined products, including petrol, cheaper.

      "bodyText": "Investors could see the FTSE 100 - currently at 6073 - slip below 6000 during the current market rout, according to Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct. He said: It\u2019s been another difficult day for London equities with the FTSE-100 failing to find any meaningful support, in line with sentiment across the bulk of global stock markets. Once again miners are leading the rout, this time with suggestions that some of the big names could look to use a rights issue to build so-called war chests so they\u2019re well placed to pick up distressed assets from smaller rivals when the inevitable fire sales come along. The fact oil prices have hit levels not seen in over a decade is also cause for concern, with traders taking the glass half empty approach here \u2013 US crude inventories fell, but there was simultaneously a sharp build in the corresponding gasoline reading... Downside pressure may be with us for a while yet and the obvious next level to watch for is a break below 6,000 on the FTSE-100. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It was another day of dramatic declines on global markets. It started badly with more poor Chinese data - this time from the service sector - which prompted renewed fears of a severe slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy. However there were also suggestions that the country\u2019s central bank might unveil new stimulus measures, as well as extending the ban on short selling which is due to expire at the end of this week. News that North Korea had claimed to have exploded a hydrogen bomb also unnerved investors, while the oil price continued to slide. Growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran make it unlikely the oil-rich countries will be able to agree on production cuts to cope with falling demand and oversupply. On top of that came new figures showing a 10.1m rise in gasoline inventories in the US last week. So markets fell sharply again, with commodity companies bearing the brunt of the selling, although they recovered from their worst levels towards the end of trading. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 63.86 points or 1.04% to 6073.38, having earlier fallen as low as 6018. Around 22 points of the decline came from mining and oil companies Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.93% to 10,214.02 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.26% at 4480.47 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 2.67% to 20,422.39 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.48% at 9197.4 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.57% to 617.59 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 217 points or 1.26%. Brent crude is 5.1% lower at $34.56 a barrel, after earlier touching $34.26 - its worst level for around eleven and a half years. Back with the stock markets, and the day\u2019s events seemed to follow a familiar pattern according to Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. He said: The 2016 meltdown has moved into its third day, with both European and US markets selling off heavily once more, spurred on by yet another leg lower in crude prices. A hat-trick of underperforming services PMIs saw the Chinese, UK and US readings all fall short of market expectations today. With the UK and US heavily reliant on the services sector, the continued slide in services PMIs will no doubt be worrying, with certain negative implications for future growth in both countries. As we head towards the European close there is a distinct pattern taking shape, with selling dominating the morning session, followed by a rally within the crossover period between the US and European markets. Perhaps this is US optimism at work, yet there certainly appears to be substantially more negativity within Europe than in the US, despite the fact that the Fed is the only central bank to be raising rates. Following the news that the US added 10.1m barrels of gasoline to inventories last week, John Kilduff of Again Capital told CNBC: It\u2019s the biggest increase in gasoline supply since 1993. Gasoline prices are going to collapse. On the other hand US crude inventories dropped by 5.1m barrels last week, but this has done nothing to support the oil price. And now a new low for the day. Brent crude is down $2 a barrel or 5.7% at $34.30, in the wake of the US inventory figures. These have added to worries about oversupply and falling demand, at a time when tensions between Saudia Arabia and Iran make it less likely the major producers will be able to agree on production cuts. After staging a minor recovery, oil prices are falling again after US gasoline stocks rose by 10.6m last week, the biggest weekly rise since 1993, according to the US Energy Information Administration. So Brent crude is now down 4.75% at $34.69, back down towards the lows of the day. However: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: Whilst not quite at bad their early afternoon nadirs, the global indices were still drunk off today\u2019s toxic China/oil/North Korea cocktail, staggering to fresh lows like a troop of inebriated uncles at an uncomfortable family function. The Dow Jones, at its worst down by nearly 300 points, settled into a 200 point loss as the open receded into the background, lifted slightly by an absurdly strong ADP non-farm employment change figure and a shrinking trade balance number. Some of that goodwill was undone, however, by a huge month-on-month drop in factory orders (from 1.5% to -0.2%) and a pair of Markit and ISM services PMIs that, at 54.3 and 55.1 respectively, both worryingly underperformed expectations. And whilst the Dow may have climbed away from its lows, it remains both firmly below the 17000 mark and approaching 3 month lows. Over in Europe and things remained just as bad, the DAX, CAC and FTSE all haemorrhaging around 1-1.5% as the day dragged on. If anything it is admirable the UK index hasn\u2019t fallen even further given that Brent Crude truly lost its way this Wednesday, trading below $35 per barrel to hit new 11 year lows for most of the afternoon, at one point extending its losses to nearly 5%. Here are the bigget fallers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It\u2019s a broad based decline, with only retailer Wal Mart bucking the downward trend: And US factory orders fell in November and inventories declined for the fifth straight month, according to the Commerce Department. New orders slipped 0.2% in November compared to a 1.3% rise in October, itself downgraded from an initial reading of 1.5%. Inventories fell 0.3% in November after a 0.5% decline the previous month. The ISM non-manufacturing report also suggests some weakness in the US economy. Its PMI came in at 55.3 in December, down from 55.9 in November and lower than the 56 that analysts had been expecting. This was the lowest reading since April 2014. But the new orders index rose from 57.5 in November to 58.2, while the business activity index improved from 58.2 to 58.7. The Markit survey suggests that US economic growth could be losing momentum. Its chief economist Chris Williamson said: The PMI surveys show the service sector losing momentum alongside a stalling of growth in the manufacturing sector, pushing the overall rate of economic expansion down to the weakest for a year. While the survey data indicate that the economy grew at a reasonably healthy 1.9% annualised clip in the fourth quarter, the weakness seen in the final month of the year raises concerns that growth is losing momentum, possibly quite markedly. The survey also signals robust employment growth, but likewise suggests the pace of hiring has slowed since earlier in the year as businesses have become more cautious in the face of worries such as the forthcoming elections, the strong dollar, global growth jitters and the outlook for interest rates. The December survey data are consistent with non-farm payrolls rising by around 175,000 compared to an average of 200,000 in the first eleven months of the year. Having hiked interest rates for the first time in almost a decade at the end of last year, the Fed will likely err on the side of caution and hold off with further policy tightening until the full extent of the slowdown becomes apparent. US services grew more strongly than expected in December, according to Markit, but were still at their lowest level since January last year. Its services PMI came in at 54.3 compared to expectations of 54 and an initial reading of 53.7. But it was weaker than the November figure of 56.1. Markit\u2019s composite PMI for December was 54, down from 55.9 in November and the lowest since December 2014. Markit said: December data highlighted that the U.S. service sector ended the year on a weaker growth footing, with business activity and incoming new work both expanding at slower rates than in November. Staffing numbers continued to rise at a solid pace, but the latest survey suggested a greater degree of caution about the business outlook. The ISM non-manufacturing survey is due shortly. As expected, US markets are joining in the global downturn, sparked by the latest poor Chinese data, this time from the service sector, and of course the reports of a hydrogen bomb test by North Korea. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 235 points or 1.4% in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 1%, while Nasdaq is off 1.5% (not helped by weakness in Apple following reports of iPhone 6 production cutbacks.) Oil continues to fall, the latest lurch down coming after the strong ADP jobs report which has in turn strengthened the dollar on the basis of more possible US interest rate rises. Commodities are denominated in dollars, so any rise in the US currency makes them more expensive to hold. So Brent crude is now down 4.7% at $34.71 a barrel, having touched a low of $34.62. That\u2019s a new low of more than 11 years (since July 2004). Here is our story on the oil price slide: There\u2019s quite a New Year hangover in the markets today. Today\u2019s selloff has sent European stocks down to a three-week low, knocking 1.7% off the Stoxx 600 index (which tracks listed companies across Europe). That pretty much wipes out the \u201cSanta Rally\u201d that kicked off after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in mid December: Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst at IG, says weak Chinese data and tensions overseas have hurt stocks this week. Only three days into the new year and both the economic data and equity markets in China are giving investors plenty to worry about. The People\u2019s Bank of China has already suspended equity markets, closing them early for the day, injected 130 billion yuan into the markets and has now weakened the currency. What will the fourth day of the trading year bring? The escalation in rhetoric between Saudi Arabia and Iran has already heightened fears over the Middle East and now North Korea has decided this is the optimum time to carry out its latest nuclear bomb test. If 2016 is going to be a good one for equities, they are going to have to do it the hard way. Here\u2019s today\u2019s damage, with just over two hours trading left in Europe: City firm Fathom Consulting is particularly pessimistic about China - it believes growth is way, way below the official reading of 7% (which is also Beijing\u2019s official target) Today\u2019s ADP report shows that the US labour market saved the best till last.... Is it too early to speculate about another US interest rate rise? Rob Carnell of ING thinks markets could start pricing in a fresh rise in borrowing costs in March, if Friday\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll matches today\u2019s decent ADP jobs report. Such a move would be backed by rising inflation, notwithstanding what is currently happening to oil prices - the base effects from last year dominate any current downward pressure on prices. Wages too will likely bolster the case for more tightening (only +0.2%mom needed to take wage inflation to 2.8% in December), and sooner than markets are expecting. There is still a long way to go until the March meeting, and we think that by the time we get there, the Fed will have managed to come up with an excuse for dragging its feet some more. But in the meantime, stronger labour data, rising inflation and wages are making a decent case for a more aggressive Fed, a stronger USD, and higher bond yields. America\u2019s trade deficit narrowed in November, according to figures just released by the Commerce Department. With businesses reducing inventory, imports fell to their lowest level in five years, with exports also declining but at a lower rate. So the trade gap fell by 5% to $42.4bn, while October\u2019s deficit was revised up to $44.6bn for $43.9bn. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: The November US trade deficit narrowed by a little over $2bn to $42.374bn, which will help lift the fourth quarter 2015 GDP figures by about 0.1%/0.2% relative to what a flat reading would have delivered (assuming this is sustained). But this is not quite as good a data post as first glance shows. The deficit was not materially affected by petroleum flows or prices, with the ex-petroleum deficit actually narrowing even more than the headline figure. What appears to be dominating this result is a sharp (1.7% month on month) decline in imports, particularly on the goods side (service imports broadly unchanged). And this may reflect a much weaker level of underlying demand in the economy than some other recent data have suggested. Exports were a little softer too, but it is weak imports that dominated this result. Analysts are surprised by the unexpectedly strong US private sector jobs report. It doesn\u2019t really match up to recent economic data, particularly from US manufacturing sector: Breaking: American companies hired more new staff than expected last month. It\u2019s a sign that the US labour market remains robust, despite weakening economic growth in emerging markets such as China. The closely watched monthly survey conducted by the Automatic Data Processing (ADP) showed that 257,000 new private sector jobs were created last month. That beats estimates; it\u2019s around 62,000 more jobs than expected. It suggests Friday\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report will not contain any shocks that might make the Federal Reserve regret raising interest rates last month. undefined Wall Street traders should take their tin hats into work. The futures market is predicting chunky falls across the three main share markets, CNBC flags up. Trading begins in 75 minutes, at 2.30pm GMT. America\u2019s tech-heavy Nasdaq index is on track to shed 2% when trading begins, in an hour and half\u2019s time. That reflects concerns that Apple is reportedly cutting iPhone production, which may herald wider problems in the technology sector.... There was no relief to the commodity crunch this morning: Shares in tech giant Apple are on track to hit their lowest level since last August, when Wall Street opens. According to reports from China, Apple is cutting back on production of its iPhone 6 smartphone, in response to weaker than expected sales. Foxconn, a major iPhone assembler, has already cut staff levels according to the Wall Street Journal. The news has already hit the shares of the various tech firms whose components go into the iPhone. ARM, the UK chip firm, are down 3%. And Apple is on track to fall by 2.7% to around $99.98.... European markets are lurching lower -- the FTSE 100 is flirting with a triple-digit loss, as concern swirls over China and North Korea. The German, French and Italian markets are also deeper in the red: Mining firms are still the biggest fallers, as commodity prices are hit by concerns over the global economy. The fall in the crude price has hit producer Tullow Oil, which is down over 5%. In another sign of nervousness, the price of gold is rising: The Russian rouble is being hit by the weakening oil price, dropping 1% to 74 roubles to the US dollar. Oil is continuing to slide..... Today is definitely a \u201crisk-off\u201d trading session, says Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at online bank Swissquote Bank. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s announcement of a hydrogen bomb test has done little to calm already jittery nerves. The announcement was supported by media outlets reporting a \u201cman-made\u201d earthquake in the area that North Korea generally uses to test their nuclear capabilities. This concerning news follows directly on the heels of the escalations of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Given the weak economic growth data emulating for emerging markets recently investors had little appetite to wait around. Spreadex\u2019s Conner Campbell says markets are suffering a triple-whammy -- poor Chinese data, weakening oil, and North Korean worries. \u201cThe dismal start to 2016 appears to have only intensified this Wednesday, with disappointing Chinese services data (sending the yuan to a 5-year low against the dollar even if the Shanghai Composite managed some counter-intuitive growth), a fresh 11-year low for Brent Crude and reports of a fourth nuclear test from North Korea.\u201d There\u2019s still 90 minutes to wait until dawn breaks over New York. But any early-rising Wall Street workers should brace for a lively day. The futures market is predicting the Dow Jones industrial average will shed almost 200 points, or 1.3%, at the open. A fresh dose of gloom has swept the oil market today, driving down crude prices to their lowest levels since the summer of 2004. Rising geopolitical tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran pushed prices down; good news for consumers, and countries who import their energy supplies, but another blow to producers. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, tumbled by 2% to just $35.52 per barrel, a new 11-year low. US crude dropped 1.5% to $35.38. This partly reflects concerns over China\u2019s slowing economy -- weaker growth equals less demand for energy. But oil traders are also watching the tensions between Tehran and Riyadh carefully. Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with Iran after protesters ransacked the Saudi embassy in Tehran, following Saudi\u2019s execution of a senior Shia Muslim cleric. Middle Eastern tensions usually push the oil price up. But in this case, it dampens the prospect of producers working together and cutting the amount of crude hitting the market. RBC Capital Markets say: In particular, we would highlight the government\u2019s decision to execute the prominent Shiite Cleric and political dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr as a catalyst for increased sectarian tension both at home and throughout the region. At the time of writing, protests had broken out in the restive city of Qatif in the Kingdom\u2019s oil-rich eastern province and angry demonstrators had set the Saudi Embassy in Tehran on fire. Returning to China... Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says traders are alarmed that Beijing allowed the yuan to hit a five-year low today. The sentiment-sensitive Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars dropped while the safety-linked Japanese Yen pushed higher as risk aversion gripped markets in Asian trade. The move followed China\u2019s move to set the daily reference rate for the onshore Yuan exchange rate at the lowest in five years. \u201cNewswires suggested the move reflected Beijing\u2019s determination that the economy needs additional stimulus, which implies a deteriorating growth outlook. Curiously, the prospect of additional policy support might have been expected to be supportive for sentiment considering a slowdown in China has been baked into consensus forecasts for some time. He also reckons traders should chill... \u201cWith this in mind, today\u2019s move may prove to be a reflexive, knee-jerk response rather than a sober evaluation of China\u2019s FX policy on its merits. The PBOC spooked investors when it began to rapidly revalue the Yuan in August, catching markets off-guard and sending asset prices scrambling. Today\u2019s response may reflect fears of a similar scenario, but the ingredients for a repeat appear to be absent. Growth across the UK\u2019s service sector dipped last month, suggesting the British economy isn\u2019t growing as fast as hoped. Markit\u2019s UK Services PMI dropped to 55.5 in December, from 55.9 in November. That still shows robust expansion, with firms taking on more business....but Markit sounds a little concerned about the situation. It says: Employment increased at a robust pace, albeit the weakest in five months.... Growth in recent months has been slower than in the first half of the year and when compared with the trend rates set in 2013-14. Reflecting this, outstanding business continued to grow only modestly in December, and firms\u2019 longer-term expectations for business activity were the weakest since early-2013. Jeremy Cook of currency exchange firm World First wonders if the service sector may have peaked: Despite France\u2019s problems, private sector growth across the euro area has hit its highest level since mid-2011. Data firm Markit reports that activity rose across Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Ireland last month, with many firms taking on more staff. Its composite PMI, which measures manufacturing and service sector growth across the eurozone, hit 54.3, up from 54.2 in November. That indicates that growth in the final three months of 2015 was the strongest since the eurozone debt crisis kicked off. Ireland posted the fastest growth, continuing a strong run. More surprisingly, Italy was the second-best performer, ahead of Germany. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the data is encouraging: \u201cThe eurozone economy starts 2016 on a solid footing and well placed to enjoy a year of robust expansion. Growth of business activity continued to edge higher at the end of 2015, with an upturn in the PMI rounding off the strongest quarter for four- and-a-half years. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly encouraging to see firms taking on staff in increased numbers, suggesting that businesses are preparing for stronger demand in the coming year by boosting capacity.\u201d France is kicking off 2016 where it ended 2015, with more bad economic news. Markit\u2019s French service sector PMI, which measures activity across the sector, fell to 49.8 in December. That\u2019s an 11-month low, and suggests a small contraction) (50 is the cutoff point). Firms reported that new business growth slowed to near-stagnation during the month which also suggests economic demand is weak. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, flags up that business expectations are also lacklustre, following November\u2019s terrorist atrocities in Paris. Anecdotal evidence suggested that a number of businesses continued to be affected by cancellations following the recent terrorist attacks, exerting a drag on new business growth. Correspondingly, business expectations dipped to the lowest level for over a year. Service providers responded by cutting their charges to the greatest extent in six months, which they will be hoping may spur new work intakes to get the New Year off to a more positive start.\u201d Back in the UK, John Lewis has shrugged off a drop in shoppers at its high street outlets to report a \u201cstrong\u201d Christmas. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details: Group sales for the six weeks to 2 January rose 4.1% from a year earlier to \u00a31.81bn as sales at its John Lewis department store business, including online, rose 6.9% to \u00a3951.3m. At operations open a year or more, John Lewis sales rose 5.1% with performance spread between homeware, fashion and technology. Sales at John Lewis department stores fell 1.2%, reflecting fewer visits to high streets and shopping centres as online sales jumped 21.4%. Maybe that Man in the Moon advert charmed the shoppers again (despite cynical hacks wondering what terrible crime the old chap had committed to prompt his lunar exile). Personally I preferred Monty the Penguin. China\u2019s yuan is continuing to weaken -\u2013 it just hit a record low of 6.7250 to the US dollar in London trading, according to Reuters. Stocks are weakening across Europe this morning. As this chart shows, the basic resources sector (miners and energy suppliers) are the worst hit, but it\u2019s a pretty broad selloff: Mining shares are leading the selloff in London, with BHP Billiton down 4%, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta shedding 3.7% and Glencore down 2.9%. That highlights concerns that China\u2019s economy may be slowing faster than official figures show, which would dampen demand for commodities. UK fashion chain Burberry is also feeling the chill, dropping 2.3% at the open. It warned in October that Chinese demand for its pricy coats and handbags had weakened since last summer\u2019s stock market turmoil. Down we go again..... Europe\u2019s stock markets are dropping in early trading, hit by worries over China and anxiety over North Korea\u2019s nuclear test. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed almost 1% at the open, with other markets close behind. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors have plenty to worry about: Geopolitical risk has moved up a gear thanks to North Korea testing a hydrogen bomb for supposed self defense which will only go to make for more tension with its neighbours, while China data disappointed with a pullback in PMI Services adding to Monday\u2019s weakness in Manufacturing, bolstering investor fears about the slowing economy. China\u2019s stock markets are defying today\u2019s selloff, and rallying on hopes that Beijing will be forced into more stimulus moves soon. The Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.7% to close 61 points higher, at 3,539 points. That still leaves the index down 5% this year, after Monday\u2019s 7% slump forced trading to be suspended. Most Asian stock markets has fallen today, driven down by worries over China and the nuclear test claims from North Korea. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 1%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index lost 0.8% to hit its lowest level since October. More here: In another sign of problems building in China, the country\u2019s currency has hit a five-year low against the US dollar today. The People\u2019s Bank of China surprised investors by setting its daily yuan fix at the lowest level since April 2011, which triggered fresh selling overseas. CNBC has the details: The offshore yuan fell to 6.6915 against the greenback, the lowest rate of exchange since at least the last quarter of 2010 and a 2.1 percent discount to the onshore yuan\u2019s 6.5506 level. The People\u2019s Bank of China has been under growing pressure as nervous investors pull capital out of the country. A weaker yuan should help Chinese firms compete overseas, but may also fuel concern about currency wars. Nizam Idris, head of foreign-exchange and fixed-income strategy at Macquarie Bank in Singapore, has told Bloomberg that the drop in the yuan will \u201cconfuse\u201d the markets. Economists are concerned to see that China\u2019s service sector growth ground to a halt last month. Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore, warned: \u201cThis sentiment gauge clearly clouds the growth outlook for China,\u201d Iris Pang, greater China economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong, hopes for a recovery this month. \u201cServices have felt the heat from the economic slowdown....Spending in the Chinese New Year may lead to a rebound\u201d. This chart from Caixin shows how China\u2019s economy took a dive in December, with service sector growth hitting a 17 month low and manufacturing actually shrinking (as we learned on Monday) Dr He Fan, their chief economist, says it shows Beijing needs to do more to stimulate its economy: \u201cThe headline Caixin China General Services PMI for December is 50.2, down 1 point from the reading for the previous month and reaching the lowest point in 17 months. The Caixin Composite Output Index came in at 49.4, below the 50-point neutral level and 1.1 points lower than November\u2019s record. In light of the setback to services sector growth, the government needs to gradually relax restrictions in the sector. This will release the potential of supply-side reform, improve the economic structure and help with the industrial transformation and upgrading.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Worries over China\u2019s economy are in focus again this morning. Overnight, fresh data has shown that the country\u2019s service sector economy grew at its slowest rate in 17 months in December. The Caixin/Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) fell to 50.2 last month, which implies that the sector basically stagnated last month. That follows Monday\u2019s weak manufacturing data, and adds to concerns that its economy is softening, It also suggests Beijing\u2019s move to a more consumer-driven economy isn\u2019t going as well as hoped. Investors are also (understandably) alarmed that North Korea is claiming to have detonated a hydrogen bomb overnight (live coverage of that drama is here). That\u2019s weighing on Asia markets, which are mostly in the red today, and driving up the US dollar. We get service sector data from across Europe this morning, which is likely to show that the slow recovery in the eurozone continued in December (with Germany doing rather better than France). The eurozone data comes in dribs-and-drabs from 8.15am to 9am GMT, with the UK services PMI at 9.30am. We then get the US services data at 3pm, after the monthly ADP report shows how many new private sector jobs were created last month. That will tee up Friday\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll (the broad measure of the American labour market). And in the City, investors will be chewing through Christmas trading figures from retail bellwether John Lewis, and Topps Tiles. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

A hat-trick of underperforming services PMIs saw the Chinese, UK and US readings all fall short of market expectations today. With the UK and US heavily reliant on the services sector, the continued slide in services PMIs will no doubt be worrying, with certain negative implications for future growth in both countries.</p> <p>As we head towards the European close there is a distinct pattern taking shape, with selling dominating the morning session, followed by a rally within the crossover period between the US and European markets.

But this is not quite as good a data post as first glance shows.</p> <p>The deficit was not materially affected by petroleum flows or prices, with the ex-petroleum deficit actually narrowing even more than the headline figure.<br></p> <p>What appears to be dominating this result is a sharp (1.7% month on month) decline in imports, particularly on the goods side (service imports broadly unchanged).

      "bodyText": "The phrase \u201ccurrency war\u201d speaks to a seemingly phoney battle between the world\u2019s major trading powers over the price of exports. It has all the attributes of an illusory conflict because no one ever agrees that a genuine dispute has taken place. And as long as everyone denies they have drawn swords to slash their currency to compete with rival powers, talk of a war fizzles and dies. There is a fringe constituency of analysts who have long argued that, much like the hundred years\u2019 war of intermittent battles between England and France, currency wars make headlines only when there is a lurch in policy, which is the equivalent of deploying archers and unleashing the cavalry. China\u2019s decision to set its benchmark for the yuan at a five-year low is such a moment. It makes clear what has been true since last August, namely that the Communist leadership believes it needs a low-valued currency to help bail out its ailing export industries. The problem is that everyone wants to use the same trick. Beijing\u2019s decision followed a similar deployment by the European Central Bank, which last January amassed all its weapons to drive down the value of the euro. The ECB\u2019s reluctant move came after the Japanese central bank did something similar a year earlier. And going back to the height of the financial crisis, the worst-hit economies \u2013 the US and Britain \u2013 expended vast resources driving down the value of their currencies. In each case, policymakers denied their currency was even a minor concern. The funds, they said, were spent to boost inflation, reduce unemployment or rescue banks in need of cheap loans. Yet these disavowals are hollow and fit a growing trend for policymakers to simply deny the effects of their proposals if they believe them to be politically unpalatable. The ECB boss, Mario Draghi, needed a low-value euro after his other efforts to increase growth failed. And it worked, at least in the first year of operation. As soon as he started pumping \u20ac60bn (\u00a345bn) a month into the eurozone economy, the value of the euro tumbled and exports grew. The latest figures, showing the recovery remains on track, are almost solely the result of the weak euro boosting Italian, Spanish and French exports. Tokyo was a little more honest when its central bank started to print money. In 2013, the incoming central bank boss, Haruhiko Kuroda, was given the explicit task of driving down the value of the yen by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as part of a three-arrowed scheme to increase growth. Now the value of the yen is climbing as China devalues. American multinationals are lobbying Congress to complain about the high value of the dollar and British business groups argue that the UK\u2019s recovery is cooling as a result of the high pound against the euro. This is a war by other means and it has a direct impact on millions of workers in export industries, who find themselves protected or vulnerable, depending on which side they find themselves. For instance, Germany\u2019s biggest union, IG Metall, last year agreed a 3.4% wage rise for 2016 covering the 3.7 million workers in the country\u2019s metals and engineering sector. More broadly, hourly wages rose 3.1%. UK manufacturing staff, stuck in the trenches on the other side of the pound/euro divide, face layoffs, short-time working and low wage rises. The relative merits of German as opposed to UK production techniques are less important when the currency has fallen 20% in value in just two years, making German cars, fridges and vacuum cleaners cheaper. The balance of trade before Draghi started spending was already skewed heavily in Germany\u2019s favour. That situation is only going to get worse. So far, the UK authorities have refused to act. But they may need to do something if manufacturing is to be saved. Admittedly, the US is making the situation worse for its exporters by raising interest rates, which in turn is encouraging more money to pour into its banks from around the world and increasing demand for the dollar, which will raise its value. US manufacturers, which have seen domestic demand soar and are sitting on huge piles of cash, have been told to grin and bear it. UK businesses are not in the same position. Like their US counterparts, they profited from years of a low currency, and still do in relation to the dollar. But their long-term prospects are more likely tied to trade with the EU and investment decisions are more finely balanced. It won\u2019t take much more inaction from the Treasury and Bank of England for businesses to consider expanding production in other parts of the world, and not from a location that prices their goods out of the global marketplace.",

      "bodyText": "The brent crude oil price has crashed to its lowest level in 11 years as traders fretted about global overproduction. The global oil benchmark fell 5% to $34.62 a barrel at one stage, as signs of weakness in the Chinese and US economies soured expectations of stronger oil demand. The refusal of leading oil producers such as Saudi Arabia to cut their output has also led to a supply glut that has helped depress prices. Analysts believe the value of oil could still fall further, especially after figures showing a strong surge in US gasoline stockpiles. This downward trend comes despite fresh political tensions in the Middle East involving Saudi Arabia and Iran, which would usually push up prices. \u201cWith the lack of a strong upward catalyst on the horizon, we are not out of the [low oil price] woods yet,\u201d said Miswin Mahesh, an oil market analyst at Barclays Capital, adding: \u201cNon-Opec production from the North Sea, Canada and Brazil is falling, but not quick enough at a time when demand is weak, partly due to a mild winter in the northern hemisphere.\u201d New numbers showed the Chinese service sector today growing at its lowest level for 17 months while a fifth consecutive month of weaker manufacturing data led to a 7% fall in equity prices in Shanghai on Monday. They have since regained some ground. China, the driver of recent global economic growth, is slowing faster than expected, meaning oil imports are likely to be lower than anticipated. In the past, the Saudis have encouraged Opec (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) to reduce its output targets during periods of low oil prices. This time it has stuck fast in what most market watchers believe is a deliberate attempt to drive competitors from the US shale fields out of business. This ploy has been only partly successful. American output, which has surged in recent years, has remained relatively strong despite oil prices falling from their $115 peak in June 2014. The growing rapprochement between the west and Iran has increased the likelihood of a huge increase in Iranian crude exports just as Iraq and other countries are ramping up output. This has influenced price makers more than the growing standoff between Saudi and Iran over the recent execution of a Shia Muslim cleric and the terrorist attacks on Libyan oil storage tanks. The tumbling oil price has made refined products, including petrol, cheaper. The average price of unleaded fuel fell by more than 4p a litre in December to 102.89p and reduced the cost of filling up a family-sized car by more than \u00a32. Four supermarkets cut their petrol prices to below \u00a31 a litre last month and the RAC motoring organisation said on Wednesday that pump prices were likely to fall further.",

      "bodyText": "The impact of government spending cuts, jittery world markets and the prospect of an EU referendum vote have dragged down expectations of UK services growth this year. The sector, which accounts for more than three-quarters of economic activity and ranges from shops and hotels to banking, maintained its solid growth in the run-up to Christmas, but a survey found that expectations for business activity over the next 12 months was the weakest for almost three years. The Markit/Cicps UK services business activity index, a single-figure measure tracking the health of service companies, fell slightly in December to 55.5, from 55.9 in November, but remained just above the long-run survey trend level of 55.2, with a reading above 50 indicating expansion. Companies said they continued to hire staff and pay them more to cope with high levels of business in 2015, though the rate of job creation slowed to the weakest since July. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the sector had put in a solid performance and provided enough impetus to make it likely that GDP growth was 0.5% in the last quarter of the year, slightly above the 0.4% registered for the third quarter. \u201cThe services sector remained the key driver of the UK\u2019s economic upturn in December, helping to offset the recent weakness seen in manufacturing and putting the economy on the starting block for another year of 2-2.5% growth in 2016.\u201d But he warned that \u201ca rosy outlook\u201d was not guaranteed. \u201cWith business expectations about future workloads dropping to the lowest for almost three years, firms are becoming more cautious in the face of growing uncertainties. The cost impact of the living wage, government spending cuts, a potential hike in interest rates, global economic growth jitters and, of course, Brexit are all weighing on business minds and pose significant downside risks to economic growth in 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pace of hiring has already slowed accordingly as firms scale back expansion plans in what might be seen as a warning shot to those taking a complacent view of economic prospects for the coming year.\u201d Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, agreed that significant headwinds would restrict GDP growth this year. \u201cThe recovery seems unlikely to pick up significant pace this year as it is battling the renewed fiscal squeeze and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum,\u201d she said.",

The company\u2019s shares have climbed 6.9p or 1.5% to 444.1p as - a day after a positive note from Cantor Fitzgerald - analysts at Barclays raised their recommendation from equal weight to overweight. They said Royal Mail was in a period of transformation and should deliver better growth than its rivals over the next three to five years, mainly due to cost saving. They said: We see three key issues for 2016. The current wage deal expires in March and we expect a new deal to be negotiated during the first quarter of the year. Management is moving towards the closure of the defined benefit pension scheme, which will become unaffordable once the current contribution deal with the trustees expires in 2018; we would expect this to be resolved in the second half of the year and require some asset injection to close. The regulatory review, which is focusing on the access regime, has no fixed timetable within 2016, but the regulator expects next steps to be announced in the first quarter. Overall though investors are taking cover again. Asian markets set the trend with another fall, the exception being China despite disappointing services data to follow the poor manufacturing figures earlier in the week. There is some expectation of further stimulus from the country\u2019s authorities to follow the various liquidity moves made already, along with talk that the ban on short selling due to expire this week may be extended. The FTSE 100 is currently down 48.10 points at 6089.14, not helped by reports of North Korea detonating a hydrogen bomb. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: Despite a late recovery in Chinese share prices, markets continue to worry about the potential weakness of the Chinese economy in 2016. This has seen European equities fall once again as the New Year remains challenging for investors, against a backdrop of heightened geo-political tensions, global growth concerns and continued pressure on commodity prices. So mIning shares are among the leading fallers, on continuing concerns about a slowdown in China. BHP Billiton is down 27p at 719p while Rio Tinto is off 63p at 1876.5p. But BAE Systems has climbed 10p to 504p after an upbeat note from RBC, saying the company should benefit from a larger than expected US defence budget. Reasonable figures from John Lewis have lifted rivals Marks &amp; Spencer, up 2.8p to 437.8p, and Next, 25p better at \u00a368.85 after Tuesday\u2019s fall following its disappointing update. Elsewhere Home Retail has lost some of the takeover gains made after Sainsbury revealed it had made a bid approach to the Argos and Homebase owner. Home Retail is down 6.4p or 4.5% at 132.9p after jumping 41% following the news. Sainsbury has recovered 0.3p to 242.4p. Game Digital is down 4p at 106p after Liberum downgraded its ratings: Following Game\u2019s trading update on 23 December we now downgrade to hold and cut our target price from 290p to 120p. In our note on 23 December we cut our earnings per share forecasts by 60% for 2016, 42% for 2017 and 30% for 2018.

    "webTitle": "Asia Pacific stock markets extend losses after North Korea nuclear test", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asia Pacific stock markets have endured another day of losses after North Korea said it had conducted a nuclear test, stoking geopolitical concerns in the region. The Nikkei share average in Tokyo closed down more than 15 at its lowest point since October last year while the Kospi index in Seoul suffered steep falls over concerns about its northern neighbour\u2019s nuclear capability. In Australia the ASX/S&amp;P200 benchmark index was down 1%. \u201cNorth Korea woes added to investor fears and hit further the Japanese market, which was already battered by geopolitical worries about the Middle East and volatility in Chinese shares,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. The South Korean won also fell sharply on news about the nuclear test. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing dollar-long positions form from the beginning of the year and this North Korea news is not good for the market,\u201d a Bank of Korea official told Reuters. \u201cHowever, when we consider previous cases we don\u2019t feel this will have a sustained influence on markets,\u201d he said. It was North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test. Despite falls elsewhere in the region, Chinese stocks edged up on Wednesday on hopes that regulators would extend a ban on share sales by major stakeholders as Beijing scrambled to avert a potential repeat of last summer\u2019s market crash. The CSI300 index of leading companies was up 1.5% in late afternoon trading. State media reported the ban on some share sales, which had been due to expire on Friday, would remain in place until new rules to manage the process are promulgated. The market was also helped by statements from at least 30 companies saying their controlling shareholders or senior executives would not sell shares on the secondary market within the next six or 12 months to help stabilise the stock market. The reports were the latest damage-control measures announced after China\u2019s major benchmark indexes plunged 7% on Monday, forcing the first-ever nationwide trading halt and roiling global markets. Many traders largely attributed Monday\u2019s sell-off to fears that the expiry of the share sale ban, imposed during the height of the market rout last year, could see an estimated 1.24 trillion yuan ($190.23bn) of shares dumped onto the market. However, some say further restricting share sales by major shareholders was not justified, and would do little to help the market. \u201cExtending the restrictions would only prolong the problem, rather than cure it,\u201d said Shen Weizheng, fund manager at Shanghai-based Ivy Capital. Companies can extend the ban for six months, \u201cbut what about six months later? It\u2019s like the sword of the Damocles overshadowing the market.\u201d The latest worrying news on China came in a private survey which showed activity in China\u2019s services sector expanded at its slowest rate in 17 months in December, bucking robust findings in an official survey and a further indication that the world\u2019s second-largest economy has lost momentum. Policymakers and economists have been hoping that growth in services would offset persistent weakness in Chinese manufacturing and keep the economy from cooling too sharply. As the move to safe haven assets such as the yen and the US dollar continued on Wednesday, markets were also rocked after the People\u2019s Bank of China set the yuan\u2019s midpoint rate at its weakest level in 4-1/2 years. China has guided the yuan lower since a surprise devaluation of the currency last summer, rattling traders who fear it could eventually set off a round of competitive devaluations which will put further pressure on other emerging economies. Some see the tactic as a desperate attempt by China to shore up growth, prompting concerns that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy could be even weaker than imagined, though others say further yuan weakness is inevitable in the face of the strong US dollar. The US dollar touched a near three-month low of 118.35 yen and the euro slid to a nine-month trough of 127.465 yen . The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield fell by about three basis points to 2.22%. Bond yields move down when the price moves up. Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in Tokyo, said that the US and Japanese currencies were being bought because \u201cChina is in trouble, U.S. data has been disappointing, Japan refuses to increase stimulus and oil prices continue to fall, but everyone\u2019s greatest fear is that stocks have finally peaked\u201d. In commodities, crude oil prices struggled near 11-year lows and added to the pessimistic mood with the market giving more attention to the stronger dollar and swelling US inventories rather than growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Brent crude was up slightly at to $36.45 a barrel, still in reach of the 11-year trough of $35.98 hit late last month.",

      "body": "<p>Asia Pacific stock markets have endured another day of losses after North Korea said it had conducted a nuclear test, stoking geopolitical concerns in the region.<br></p> <p>The Nikkei share average in Tokyo closed down more than 15 at its lowest point since October last year while the Kospi index in Seoul suffered steep falls over concerns about its northern neighbour\u2019s nuclear capability. In Australia the ASX/S&amp;P200 benchmark index was down 1%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jan/04/stock-markets-investors-nervous-china-intervention-mistakes\">Investors nervous as China looks set to repeat mistakes of last summer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNorth Korea woes added to investor fears and hit further the Japanese market, which was already battered by geopolitical worries about the Middle East and volatility in Chinese shares,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.<br></p> <p>The South Korean won also fell sharply on news about the nuclear test.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing dollar-long positions form from the beginning of the year and this North Korea news is not good for the market,\u201d a Bank of Korea official told Reuters. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, when we consider previous cases we don\u2019t feel this will have a sustained influence on markets,\u201d he said. It was North Korea\u2019s fourth nuclear test. </p> <p>Despite falls elsewhere in the region, Chinese stocks edged up on Wednesday on hopes that regulators would extend a ban on share sales by major stakeholders as Beijing scrambled to avert a potential repeat of last summer\u2019s market crash. </p> <p>The CSI300 index of leading companies was up 1.5% in late afternoon trading.</p> <p>State media reported the ban on some share sales, which had been due to expire on Friday, would remain in place until new rules to manage the process are promulgated. </p> <p>The market was also helped by statements from at least 30 companies saying their controlling shareholders or senior executives would not sell shares on the secondary market within the next six or 12 months to help stabilise the stock market. </p> <p>The reports were the latest damage-control measures announced after China\u2019s major benchmark indexes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/04/china-manufacturing-slowdown-ftse-100-stocks-markets\">plunged 7% on Monday</a>, forcing the first-ever nationwide trading halt and roiling global markets. </p> <p>Many traders largely attributed Monday\u2019s sell-off to fears that the expiry of the share sale ban, imposed during the height of the market rout last year, could see an estimated 1.24 trillion yuan ($190.23bn) of shares dumped onto the market. <br></p> <p>However, some say further restricting share sales by major shareholders was not justified, and would do little to help the market. </p> <p>\u201cExtending the restrictions would only prolong the problem, rather than cure it,\u201d said Shen Weizheng, fund manager at Shanghai-based Ivy Capital. <br>Companies can extend the ban for six months, \u201cbut what about six months later? It\u2019s like the sword of the Damocles overshadowing the market.\u201d </p> <p>The latest worrying news on China came in a private survey which showed activity in China\u2019s services sector expanded at its slowest rate in 17 months in December, bucking robust findings in an official survey and a further indication that the world\u2019s second-largest economy has lost momentum. <br></p> <p>Policymakers and economists have been hoping that growth in services would offset persistent weakness in Chinese manufacturing and keep the economy from cooling too sharply.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/05/china-stock-market-intervention-fuels-flight-to-dollar-and-yen\">move to safe haven assets such as the yen and the US dollar </a>continued on Wednesday, markets were also rocked after the People\u2019s Bank of China set the yuan\u2019s midpoint rate at its weakest level in 4-1/2 years. <br></p> <p>China has guided the yuan lower since a surprise devaluation of the currency last summer, rattling traders who fear it could eventually set off a round of competitive devaluations which will put further pressure on other emerging economies. </p> <p>Some see the tactic as a desperate attempt by China to shore up growth, prompting concerns that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy could be even weaker than imagined, though others say further yuan weakness is inevitable in the face of the strong US dollar. <br></p> <p>The US dollar touched a near three-month low of 118.35 yen and the euro slid to a nine-month trough of 127.465 yen . The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield fell by about three basis points to 2.22%. Bond yields move down when the price moves up. </p> <p>Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in Tokyo, said that the US and Japanese currencies were being bought because \u201cChina is in trouble, U.S. data has been disappointing, Japan refuses to increase stimulus and oil prices continue to fall, but everyone\u2019s greatest fear is that stocks have finally peaked\u201d.</p> <p>In commodities, crude oil prices struggled near 11-year lows and added to the pessimistic mood with the market giving more attention to the stronger dollar and swelling US inventories rather than growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. </p> <p>Brent crude was up slightly at to $36.45 a barrel, still in reach of the 11-year trough of $35.98 hit late last month.</p>",
