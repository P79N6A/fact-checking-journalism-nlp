      "bodyText": "The chair of the bank that almost bankrupted Ireland has walked free from a Dublin court after being acquitted of misleading auditors about multimillion-euro loans. Se\u00e1n Fitzpatrick was once head of the country\u2019s biggest bank, Anglo Irish, which ended up requiring a \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn) government bailout and sent the country cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund for support. But on Wednesday, after the longest criminal trial in Irish history, a judge ordered the jury to acquit him on all charges. Later Fitzpatrick stood on the steps of the Republic\u2019s criminal courts of justice and declared: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful day.\u201d Twenty-four hours earlier Mr Justice John Aylmer had told jurors he was going to direct them to acquit Fitzpatrick. The former executive had pleaded not guilty to misleading the Anglo Irish bank\u2019s auditors about loans to him and people connected to him. On Wednesday, the 126th day of an at times a bewildering and complex trial, Fitzpatrick\u2019s defence had argued that the case should not go before the jury because of flaws in the investigation and in the prosecution case, which involved coaching witnesses and shredding documents. The trial judge told Fitzpatrick: \u201cYou are free to go; thank you very much for your attendance.\u201d Fitzpatrick replied: \u201cThank you, judge\u201d before leaving Dublin circuit criminal court. Apart from his \u201cwonderful day\u201d comment, Fitzpatrick refused to answer reporters\u2019 questions. He told them: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude, but I\u2019m not going to speak. I\u2019m not making any comment.\u201d Fitzpatrick had pleaded not guilty to 27 offences under the Republic\u2019s 1990 Companies Act. These include 22 charges of making a misleading, false or deceptive statement to auditors and five charges of furnishing false information in the years 2002 to 2007. The Irish director of public prosecutions had dropped some of these charges in the past four weeks. The case against Fitzpatrick at the Dublin circuit criminal court was a retrial after his first trial in May 2015 ended after weeks of legal argument over the flaws in the investigation by the Republic\u2019s anti-corruption corporate watchdog. Ireland\u2019s Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement said on Tuesday it accepted witnesses were coached during the investigation into Fitzpatrick and that their evidence was contaminated. It also admitted that other documents held by the watchdog were shredded by one its officials. He was said to be under enormous stress at the time. \u201cThose actions clearly should not have occurred,\u201d the ODCE said. The watchdog admitted there had been \u201cserious failures\u201d in its investigations into the Anglo Irish bankers\u2019 loans. It also confirmed that some of the statements taken in evidence against Fitzpatrick were carried out by \u201ccivilian staff\u201d who did not have proper training. Taoiseach Enda Kenny joined opposition parties in the D\u00e1il in criticising the ODCE\u2019s handling of the investigation. Kenny said if a government minister had performed as badly as some ODCE officials they would be sacked. Miche\u00e1l Martin, leader of the main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il, also criticised the Garda Sioch\u00e1na for their role in the investigation into white-collar crime that he said had been proved to be \u201cinept, negligible, wasteful and virtually redundant\u201d. In 2009, Anglo Irish was nationalised, with the Irish taxpayer having to pay \u20ac30bn (\u00a323bn) to rescue an institution that was once the preferred bank of builders and property speculators. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic boom, when it became the major financier for overstretched Irish developers and investors playing the global property market, caused national outrage. At a time of austerity cuts and the country losing its financial independence in the IMF/European Central Bank bailout programme, the sight of billions of taxpayers\u2019 money being used to save Anglo Irish provoked widespread public anger. One of those who used Anglo Irish to play the global property casino was Ireland\u2019s one-time richest man, Se\u00e1n Quinn. Quinn is the former billionaire whose rise and fall while overborrowing from Anglo Irish personifies the collapse of Ireland\u2019s Celtic Tiger economy. The 65-year-old County Fermanagh-born tycoon used to employ up to 5,000 people in construction and his family\u2019s insurance corporation. He had been previously listed at the richest Irishman in history \u2013 with a personal wealth of about \u20ac4.7bn. But Quinn went bankrupt with huge debts, having bought a significant number of shares in the former Anglo Irish Bank with a view to buying a global property empire stretching from North America to parts of the former Soviet Union.",

      "bodyText": "At the moment the ALP is having a fight over the merits of a Buffett rule for income tax. It is a high-profile battle involving two former treasurers. What perhaps has been ignored is that the ALP has also come up with a policy that might achieve some of its aims with much less tinkering with the tax system. The Buffett rule of tax comes from the US billionaire Warren Buffett, who in 2011 was surprised that, because of deductions and differing tax rates, he paid a lower average rate of tax than did his secretary. The rule generally involves setting a floor on the average tax that must be paid by very high income earners. In Australia, the Greens have a policy of a minimum of 35% tax for those earning over $300,000 \u2013 in line with that proposed by the progressive think tank the Australia Institute in 2015. The ALP is rather split over the issue. Two frontbenchers, Terri Butler and Andrew Giles, recently argued in an essay titled Tax and Equality that the Buffett rule is \u201ca readily understandable symbol of what\u2019s wrong with the present arrangements\u201d. The left wing of the party is pushing for it to be debated at the next ALP national conference. Wayne Swan has also been advocating for a debate on the idea. However, both Bill Shorten and the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, have ruled out taking a Buffett rule policy to the next election. You can see why the Buffett rule is appealing. Because of our progressive income-tax system, the average amount of tax you pay rises the more your earn. Those earning around $300,000 pay roughly 36% tax \u2013 just above the 35% minimum proposed by the Buffett rule advocates: But the problem of course is that tax is paid on taxable income, not total income. Deductions and tax strategies can enable people\u2019s taxable income to actually be much lower than their total income. As Gareth Hutchens recently reported, in 2014-15 48 millionaires paid no tax at all. The Buffett rule would catch such people and, in theory at least, force them to pay 35% tax on their income. One issue Bowen has with the rule is that while we may dislike the ability for people to reduce their taxable income to zero, society does benefit from some of the ways they do \u2013 for example, donations and angel investor funding. Such a reasoning is especially pertinent in light of the $400m donation made this week by Andrew Forrest, for which it has been reported he will claim a $200m tax deduction. Now I have no issue with him doing that, although I do take issue with the prime minister\u2019s assertion, made on Monday, that donations are somehow better than taxes because they are made with \u201clove\u201d. Personally I\u2019d prefer to rely on our hospitals and schools being built from money that comes from people and companies paying their fair share of taxes rather than wait for love to come to town. Bowen is right to be concerned about the impacts on other areas of the tax system. I wonder at the complexity of such a rule within the tax code, which would see some people be able to claim deductions but others not because of their total income. I suspect it would make for a tax lawyers\u2019 picnic. Bowen has argued instead that if the issue is deductions themselves, get rid of or limit those deductions. The most obvious of these is negative gearing. But in Shorten\u2019s budget reply he announced a new one, which I think is almost a Buffett rule by stealth. When you look at the 48 millionaires who paid no tax, one aspect really sticks out \u2013 they claimed a combined $20.2m in deductions for managing tax affairs. What the ALP is proposing to do is limit the amount you are able to claim for such a purpose at $3,000. The reasoning is clear. The average amount spent by people managing their tax affairs in 2014-15 was just $378 and yet the millionaires who reduced their tax to zero paid an average of $1.1m. When the policy was announced the deputy PM, Barnaby Joyce, took to Twitter suggesting it was an attack on all accountants\u2019 incomes. But Joyce incorrectly assumed the policy applied to businesses, whereas the ALP\u2019s policy will only apply to individuals. And the fact is it will apply to only a very small fraction of people. Most people don\u2019t even claim anything. In 2014-15 only 86,066 people out of 13.2 million claimed more than $2,500 for managing their tax affairs: And if we look at the average amount claimed according to total income, the $3,000 average only occurs for those earning over $500,000: But these averages can hide what is really occurring \u2013 and fortunately the taxation data gives us more detailed breakdown, which allows us to see a very strong link between the amount claimed for managing tax affairs and the lack of tax paid. Take for example the 33,813 people who earned between $500,000 and $1m. Most of these individuals stayed in the $180,000 plus tax bracket, and they paid on average just $3,145 on their tax affairs. But 118 of them were able to avoid paying tax by reducing their taxable income below $18,200. For these people the average cost of their tax affairs was $128,000: The desire to get below $18,200 and thus pay no tax is strong and is led by paying for your tax accountant. In 2014-15 there were two and half million people who earned between $80,000 and $180,000. They claimed an average of $416 on their tax affairs, but the 2,663 of them who were able to get below the tax-free threshold claimed an average of $20,482: Even among the two and half million people who had a taxable income below $18,200, 473,000 people claimed for management of tax affairs \u2013 and it is clear that the more you actually earned, the more you paid an accountant to help you get below the tax-free threshold: The importance of having an accountant to get your taxable income down as opposed to, for example, charitable donations is highlighted by the fact that while the millionaires who avoided paying any tax in 2014-15 accounted for just 0.4% of all millionaires, they claimed 3% of the total donations made by millionaires but a staggering 20% of all money spent on tax affairs: The Buffett rule certainly is appealing and is definitely worth debating. But the ALP\u2019s policy of limiting deductions for managing tax affairs will go some way to limiting the ability of the very wealthy to avoid paying tax. It is not a cure-all but it certainly is a sharp way to target those who pay people vast sums of money to avoid paying even more vast amounts of tax.",

The average amount spent by people managing their tax affairs in 2014-15 was just $378 and yet the millionaires who reduced their tax to zero paid an average of $1.1m.</p> <p>When the policy was announced the deputy PM, Barnaby Joyce, took to Twitter suggesting it was an attack on all accountants\u2019 incomes. But Joyce incorrectly assumed the policy applied to businesses, whereas the ALP\u2019s policy will only apply to individuals.</p> <p>And the fact is it will apply to only a very small fraction of people. Most people don\u2019t even claim anything. In 2014-15 only 86,066 people out of 13.2 million claimed more than $2,500 for managing their tax affairs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WCf3d/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And if we look at the average amount claimed according to total income, the $3,000 average only occurs for those earning over $500,000: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Y28m5/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But these averages can hide what is really occurring \u2013 and fortunately the taxation data gives us more detailed breakdown, which allows us to see a very strong link between the amount claimed for managing tax affairs and the lack of tax paid. </p> <p>Take for example the 33,813 people who earned between $500,000 and $1m. Most of these individuals stayed in the $180,000 plus tax bracket, and they paid on average just $3,145 on their tax affairs. But 118 of them were able to avoid paying tax by reducing their taxable income below $18,200. For these people the average cost of their tax affairs was $128,000: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2Cx2W/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The desire to get below $18,200 and thus pay no tax is strong and is led by paying for your tax accountant. </p> <p>In 2014-15 there were two and half million people who earned between $80,000 and $180,000.

      "bodyText": "UK shares managed to end the day in positive territory, as investors shrugged off Moody\u2019s downgrade of China\u2019s credit rating. The FTSE 100 edged higher while the FTSE 250 recorded yet another closing high. But with the euro holding steady, European markets were more subdued, dipping lower by the close. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 29.61 points or 0.4% higher at 7514.90 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.13% to 12,642.87 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.13% at 5341.34 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.21% to 21,369.73 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.08% lower at 10.907.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.17% to 766.03 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 27 points or 0.13%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with Moody\u2019s downgrade of China\u2019s credit rating, and Capital Economics says it is not surprised the market reaction has been limited. The forecasting group\u2019s Daniel Christen and Mark Williams said: There was no particular trigger for the move, other than ongoing concerns about the lack of reform momentum in the country\u2019s financial markets... Ultimately, as is often the case with such downgrades, the announcement contained little, if any, \u201cnews\u201d: China\u2019s struggles to bring down leverage, while maintaining rapid economic growth are well-documented, and Moody\u2019s had lowered its outlook for China in March 2016. Bond prices barely moved. Most are purchased overwhelmingly by domestic, state-owned banks, and held to maturity. There was therefore little chance of a spike in yields. And in any case, an A1 rating still puts China well within \u201cinvestment grade\u201d status. Admittedly, excessive credit growth raises the risks of a government bailout out of the financial sector in the event of a severe downturn, which could plausibly add around 35%-pts to the debt ratio. But with only a tiny fraction of China\u2019s debt denominated in dollars, there is little chance of an outright default: the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) can theoretically inflate away the debt. Moreover, while we expect a slowdown in GDP growth, we do not expect a \u201chard-landing\u201d. Equity markets dropped initially \u2013 the Shanghai Composite fell by about 1% on the news \u2013 but had recouped their losses by the end of trading. We have long argued that Chinese equities might face a downward correction once the economy starts to slow, and as the crackdown on leverage begins to bite. But there is little chance of a slump, as P/E ratios are nowhere near the levels reached just during the bubble in the first half of 2015 and not particularly high relative to levels seen at other times in the past. Finally, there appears to have been little pressure on the renminbi. While it might weaken a little this year, we then see it rising again to \u00a56.8/$ in 2018, and \u00a56.5/$ in 2019, as the dollar starts to come under pressure against the other \u201cmajor\u201d currencies, and as the authorities in China permit some appreciation of their currency in trade-weighted terms. The jump in the oil price has not lasted long. With the key Opec meeting on Thursday, some caution has returned to the market after the positive price move after the bigger than expected drop in US crude stocks. Brent is now down 0.15% at $54.07 a barrel. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: US crude stockpiles dropped by an impressive 4.4 million barrels last week, according to data released this afternoon. While the news did cause a spike in the price of crude, traders then remembered that the Opec meeting is tomorrow and reversed course. Now we all wait for Opec, although tomorrow\u2019s schedule suggests that we have a whole day ahead of us before Opec announces its decision to the world. On the stock market he said: \u2018Off the lows\u2019 is about the best that can be said of a very dull session in London... For the time being, we are still stuck with a market that doesn\u2019t want to go down, but it doesn\u2019t want to go up, either. Ahead of the Opec meeting on Thursday, which could well see production cuts extended for nine months, comes data showing a bigger than forecast decline in US crude stocks. They fell by 4.43m barrels last week to 516.34m, compared to expectations of a 2.4m barrel drop. Byt gasoline stocks fell by a smaller than expected 787,000 barrels. The news has pushed oil prices higher, with Brent crude now up 0.7% at $54.53 a barrel. Before the US figures, it was sitting at $54.33, up 0.33%. The earlier speech by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has given some support to the euro. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: There was little in Mario Draghi\u2019s speech to indicate when the European Central Bank might start to reduce its policies of quantitative easing and low interest rates, but there was enough to boost investors\u2019 hopes that the eurozone\u2019s finances can remain stable. Draghi\u2019s confirmation that it will be business as usual for the ECB has seen the euro strengthen initially, with the financial stimulus provided by the bank looking set to continue for the foreseeable future. However, Draghi should be wary that the low inflationary pressure, caused by muted wage growth across the continent, doesn\u2019t stamp out the green shoots of recovery that he has helped to sow. Over to the US, and some disappointing housing figures. Existing home sales fell by a higher than expected 2.3% in April, due to a shortage of houses on the market. They fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57m units, compared to expectations of a 1.1% decline. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said: Last month\u2019s dip in closings was somewhat expected given that there was such a strong sales increase in March at 4.2 percent, and new and existing inventory is not keeping up with the fast pace homes are coming off the marke. Demand is easily outstripping supply in most of the country and it\u2019s stymieing many prospective buyers from finding a home to purchase. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s Opec meeting in Vienna - where there are hopes of an agreement to extend the production restrictions agreed in November - comes a recommendation from Opec and non-Opec monitoring committee. The committee said it believed the cutbacks should be extended by nine months: The [monitoring committee] took note of the current market conditions, including the level of global inventories, and concluded that it is necessary to extend the production adjustments. The Committee also took note of the fact that the duration of the anticipated extension should be longer than the originally stated period in the Declaration of Cooperation of six months. The [monitoring committee] then considered several scenarios presented by the [technical committee] regarding the extension of the Declaration of Cooperation and decided to recommend that the production adjustments of the participating countries be extended for nine months commencing 1 July 2017. In this regard, the [monitoring committee] should continue monitoring conformity levels as well as market conditions and immediate prospects, and recommend further adjustment actions, if deemed necessary. More from the European Central Bank, and governing council member and head of the Bank of Slovenia Bostjan Jazbec: US markets have opened marginally higher, helped by a positive start for technology stocks. Ahead of the latest Federal Reserve minutes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 6 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite opened around 0.1% and 0.2% higher respectively. He was one of the masters of the Irish financial universe whose bank almost bankrupted Ireland. But on Wednesday the former chairman of the Anglo Irish Bank Sean Fitzpatrick walked free from a Dublin court after being acquitted of misleading the bank\u2019s auditors about multi-million euro loans. After the longest trial in Irish criminal history Fitzpatrick stood on the steps of the Republic\u2019s Criminal Courts of Justice to declare: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful day.\u201d Twenty four hours earlier Mr Justice John Aylmer had told jurors he was going to direct them to acquit Fitzpatrick. The former Anglo Irish Bank executive had pleaded not guilty to misleading the bank\u2019s auditors about loans to him and people connected with him. Today, the 126th day of at bewildering and complex trial, Fitzpatrick\u2019s defence had argued that the case should not go before the jury because of flaws in the investigation process and in the prosecution case.... We\u2019ll have more details shortly.... Investors searching for clues as to when the European Central Bank might start gradually reducing its stimulus measures will find little in president Mario Draghi\u2019s latest comments. In a speech in Madrid on financial stability, Draghi said there was no need to change its current guidance, saying the euro area was seeing \u201can increasingly solid recovery driven largely by a virtuous circle of employment and consumption, although underlying inflation pressures remain subdued.\u201d He said: The macroeconomic environment is improving. The monetary policy measures put in place in recent years have proven to be effective at sustaining a resilient recovery that is increasingly broad-based across countries and sectors. This recovery in turn contributes to greater financial sector resilience...Nonetheless, we remain vigilant. Negative rates may also have unwarranted side-effects, but those have so far remained limited. Our current assessment of the side effects suggest therefore that there is no reason to deviate from the indications we have been consistently providing in the introductory statement to our press conferences. It\u2019s been a tough few months for Tiffany &amp; co, with regular protests close to its flagship store in New York (it\u2019s right next to Trump Tower...). And the upmarket jewellery chain has just delivered more bad news, with quarterly sales missing expectations in the last quarter. Shares in Tiffany have dropped almost 5% in pre-market trading, after it posted a 2% drop in comparable sales across the globe. Like-for-like sales in the America shrank by 4%, due to \u201clower spending by both foreign tourists and local customers\u201d. They fell by 3% in the Asia-Pacific region, and also in Europe, and by 1% in Japan. Moody\u2019s downgrade has made a small dent in the copper price. Copper traded on the London Metal Exchange has fallen 0.6% to $5,678 a tonne. Back in February it was trading at $6,200. Why hasn\u2019t Moody\u2019s warning about China\u2019s slowing economy and rising debts caused more alarm? I think it\u2019s because canny investors (who have the same information as Moody\u2019s) already understood the challenges facing Beijing. They\u2019d already priced its debt accordingly. Secondly: institutional investors are often forced, by their own rules, to sell sovereign debt after a downgrade because it is officially riskier. But Chinese debt is mainly held by Chinese investors, who wouldn\u2019t feel the same compulsion. Alan Siow of BlueBay Asset Management explains: Downgrade largely expected and priced in, with China IG [investment grade] spreads trading wider to equivalently rated developed market and emerging market peers prior to the announcement. China IG issuance is largely owned by Chinese end investors (some estimates are as high as 80%), and foreign investors are underweight, so limited forced selling. Downgrade rational is uncontroversial and highlights well understood vulnerabilities (i.e. not new news) After being rattled by Moody\u2019s, China\u2019s stock market managed to recover its losses by the close of trading. The Shanghai Composite Index closed up 1 point, or 0.06%, as investors digested the news that China had been downgraded by one notch to A1 (the fifth-highest rating). Vishnu Varathan, Asia head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, believes the one-notch downgrade will cause some angst, as Beijing deals with some of the bad debt incurred by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). \u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite negative in terms of sentiment,particularly at a time when China is looking to de-risk the banking system (and) when there\u2019s going to be some potential restructuring of SOEs.\u201d David Cheetham, chief market analyst at brokerage XTB, says China has now been bumped back up the list of worries. \u201cAfter being very much at the front and centre of global risk sentiment at the beginning of last year, the Chinese slowdown story has been almost forgotten, with politics throughout Europe and the U.S. taking the limelight.\u201d The price of iron ore traded in the Chinese city of Dalian slumped by 7% today, partly thanks to Moody\u2019s downgrade. Local reports also blamed signs that stockpiles are building up (suggesting a dip in demand). The wider iron ore prices also fell, but less steeply, adding to recent losses in the last few months. Fred Goodwin might still get his day in court, whether he likes it or not. A high court judge has agreed to adjourn the case brought by thousands of Royal Bank of Scotland customers who say they were misled into supporting its rights issue in 2008, before the financial crisis. The case was due to begin on Monday, with Goodwin (RBS\u2019s former CEO) expected to face questions over the bank\u2019s collapse. But RBS then made a last-ditch offer to settle, which has split the investors. Both sides have now asked for a formal adjournment until June 7th, to allow talks to continue. From the high court, Jill Treanor explains: Jonathan Nash QC, representing the shareholders, told the judge on Wednesday that while prospects of a settlement remained good more time was needed. Asked by Hildyard what the impediments to a deal were, Nash said the shareholder group was not able to contact all its members. There were a \u201csmall number of shareholders whose current address does not appear to be correct\u201d, he added. The judge set a court hearing for 4pm on Thursday for an update and will require written updates next Tuesday and Thursday when the court is not sitting. This is from the BBC\u2019s Simon Jack: UBS\u2019s Paul Donovan has a refreshingly blunt take on the Moody\u2019s downgrade: One of the credit rating agencies \u2013 no one cares which one \u2013 lowered China\u2019s credit rating from something to something else \u2013 no one cares what. There was a flicker of interest in Asian markets (an unusual reaction to a credit rating agency move), but there is no real new information. Karishma Vaswani, the BBC\u2019s Asia business correspondent, has explained why Moody\u2019s downgrade will have irked the Chinese leadership: Remember - this is a critical year for President Xi Jinping, who faces a key political congress towards the end of the year. A strong economy gives him credibility and legitimacy - China observers tell me that the perception of stable growth is crucial for him at this time. This is why negative assessments from international financial institutions like Moody\u2019s on Chinese debt are unlikely to go down well in Beijing. Currently, China\u2019s debt stands at something like 260% to GDP. Higher debt levels usually mean a higher level of risk. But it is worth noting that most of this debt is held by Chinese state-owned enterprises or \u201cquasi-state\u201d like entities - not international investors - so it is less likely to have a spillover effect into other economies. All the same, as the world\u2019s second largest economy, what happens in China matters to the rest of the world. More here. Over in Sofia, European Central Bank policymaker Peter Praet has warned that Europe\u2019s recovery could falter if the ECB tightens policy too quickly. Praet told his audience that Europe\u2019s economy was recovering, thanks to domestic demand (thanks to the actions taken by the ECB!). But wage growth is still muted, meaning inflationary pressure is low. Praet struck a cautionary note, saying: While we are certainly seeing a firming, broadening and more resilient economic recovery, we still need to create a sufficiently broad and solid information basis to build confidence that the projected path of inflation is robust, durable and self-sustained. First, underlying inflation pressures still give scant indications of a convincing upward trend as domestic cost pressures, notably wage growth, remain subdued. And, second, the economic recovery and the outlook for price stability remain conditional on the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation, including our forward guidance. Without this support, the progress towards a sustained adjustment that we see in our projections will likely be slower or even stall. That might disappoint those who are pushing the ECB to start normalising monetary policy, and raise interest rates from their record lows. Mining shares in London have been hit by the Chinese downgrade. Rio Tinto has shed 1.2% while Anglo American is down 0.8%, following the drop in commodity prices (as China is a huge consumer of iron, nickel, copper, etc). Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group explains: The heavy sell-off in commodities following China\u2019s debt rating downgrade has taken its toll on the UK\u2019s mining stocks (-1.10%). Copper futures cheapened by 1.29%, as iron ore future slid more than 5%. The wider FTSE 100 has gained 13 points, back to 7499 points. Guardian Business is launching a daily email.

That\u2019s a little surprising, as the retailer reported a 10% fall in underlying profits (and a 65% slump on a pre-tax basis) this morning, and another fall in clothing sales. But investors are hoping that CEO Steve Rowe is turning the business around;. He\u2019s been talking up M&amp;S\u2019s sales of full-price clothing, after removing \u201cexcessive discounting\u201d. But DIY chain Kingfisher is having a rough morning. Shares are down 6% after reported a small fall in like-for-like sales, mainly due to a 5.5% slump in France in the last three months (was everyone too busy voting to put any shelves up?) Newsflash: Moody\u2019s has just downgraded 26 Chinese organisations, following today\u2019s sovereign credit rating downgrade. They\u2019re all classed as GRIs, or \u201cnon-financial corporate and infrastructure government-related issuers\u201d. Moody\u2019s says: The 26 issuers comprise 1) 17 GRIs and rated subsidiaries that are ultimately owned by the central government (central GRIs), and 2) nine GRIs and rated subsidiaries that are ultimately owned by regional and local governments (local GRIs). The list includes China National Petroleum Corporation, China Three Gorges Corporation, Guangzhou Metro Group, and Dongfeng Motor Group Company. Luc Froehlich, head of investment directing for Asian fixed income at Fidelity International, believes China has got a grip on its economic problems. He says: \u201cToday\u2019s downgrade is yet another sign of the challenges faced by China, which is juggling rising leverage issues, declining economic growth rates and ongoing structural reforms. \u201cDespite these mounting pressures, we are confident that China\u2019s central bank and its regulators are firmly in control of the situation. In particular, China\u2019s recent regulatory tightening should help deflate the country\u2019s credit markets and lead to long-term market stabilization. \u201d Moody\u2019s downgrade has hit the price of commodities in China. Iron ore shed 6%, with steel and coke prices also suffering, as traders anticipated weaker demand for metals and energy. It\u2019s easy to be dismissive of credit rating firms, given their shortcomings in the run-up to the financial crisis. Today\u2019s downgrade doesn\u2019t tell us anything massively new; it\u2019s no secret that China is facing rising debts, slowing growth, and a tricky tightrope from an industrial economy to a service sector one. But Moody\u2019s downgrade will matter to Chinese firms; they\u2019ll probably end up paying higher borrowing charges, now that Beijing itself is seen as riskier. The Wall Street Journal explains how Chinese banks already piggy-back on the country\u2019s sovereign credit rating (which is higher than their own). Moody\u2019s gives the broader sector a baseline credit assessment of Baa3 based on indicators like loan-to-deposit ratios and counterparty risk. But because the government owns much of the banking system and\u2014it is assumed\u2014would provide it with support in a crisis, banks are in practice able to issue debt at higher ratings. Bank of China , one of the country\u2019s big four banks, has a base rating of Baa2, but any debt it issues is rated at A1, four notches higher. By this logic, a notch down in China\u2019s rating should push down those of issuers that rely on government backing. In July 2007, when Moody\u2019s upgraded China, it simultaneously upgraded seven Chinese banks. Currently, Moody\u2019s deems about half of the state-owned entities it rates as being in the \u201cmoderate credit risk\u201d bucket. Thirteen of those companies would fall into junk territory if their ratings were lowered a notch. More here: Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University in Shenzhen, believes Beijing won\u2019t be happy about Moody\u2019s move: Balding told Bloomberg that: \u201cIt is a psychological blow that China will not take kindly to and absolutely speaks to the rising financial pressures. \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter much in the grand scheme of things because so much of Chinese debt is held by state or quasi-state actors and minimal amounts are international investors.\u201d Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says that investors won\u2019t be badly alarmed. Moody\u2019s downgraded China\u2019s credit rating overnight, to A1 with a stable outlook, from Aa3. There was an initial risk-averse reaction but this has been mostly reversed in the last few hours. The stable outcome and the fact that rating agencies are more market-following than market-leading, not to mention recent Chinese equity market under-performance, all argue that there\u2019s no new news in this move. And so, the market reaction is to buy the dip, yet again. Analysts at Macquarie Group point out that Moody\u2019s downgrade brings them into line with Fitch; so will Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s be the next to downgrade China? S&amp;P has had China on outlook negative since February 2016, indicating there is a potential downgrade brewing. But S&amp;P currently rates China one notch above Moody\u2019s and Fitch, so a cut would not break new ground.\u201d The last time Moody\u2019s downgraded China was November 1989, a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests were crushed. The Chinese government has tried to dismiss Moody\u2019s downgrade. It claims the move is based on an inappropriate, \u201cpro-cyclical\u201d approach, that is too gloomy about China\u2019s current situation and future potential. In a statement, the Minister of Finance says: \u201cThese viewpoints overestimate the difficulties facing the Chinese economy and underestimate the capabilities of China to deepen supply-side structural reform and expand overall demand.\u201d Big news from China this morning. Moody\u2019s has downgraded the country\u2019s credit rating for the first time in almost three decades. Moody\u2019s warned that China\u2019s financial strength is likely to deteriorate in the coming years, as its economy slows and its national debt keeps rising. It\u2019s a one-notch downgrade, from Aa3 (the fourth-highest rating) to A1. In a statement, Moody\u2019s explains that Beijing is likely to drive borrowing levels higher as it tries to transform China into a consumer-driven economy. And it fears that Beijing\u2019s reforms will not fully offset the rise in economic and financial risk, As Moody\u2019s put it: The downgrade reflects Moody\u2019s expectation that China\u2019s financial strength will erode somewhat over the coming years, with economy-wide debt continuing to rise as potential growth slows. \u201cWhile ongoing progress on reforms is likely to transform the economy and financial system over time, it is not likely to prevent a further material rise in economy-wide debt, and the consequent increase in contingent liabilities for the government.\u201d The agency added that debt levels across the Chinese economy are likely to keep climbing: \u201cMoody\u2019s expects that economy-wide leverage will increase further over the coming years. The planned reform program is likely to slow, but not prevent, the rise in leverage. The importance the authorities attach to maintaining robust growth will result in sustained policy stimulus, given the growing structural impediments to achieving current growth targets. Such stimulus will contribute to rising debt across the economy as a whole.\u201d The move hit shares in China, sending the Shanghai Composite Index down to its lowest level since last October. More reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be watching the US dollar. After being buffeted by Donald Trump\u2019s travails, the greenback is clawing back some ground as investors wonder whether the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates again in June. The minutes of the Fed\u2019s meeting are due out tonight (7pm BST), and could give some new clues about its next step. CMC Market\u2019s Michael Hewson explains: The US dollar appears to have caught itself a bit of a break yesterday ahead of the release of the latest Fed minutes. In the last week or so market odds of a June rate rise have fluctuated quite sharply, though the consensus still remains that it remains more or less a done deal. I still have doubts about that but the Fed do appear to have boxed themselves into a corner for a move in June, and one that they may find difficult to extricate themselves from if things do go a bit pear shaped in the next few weeks. Another central bank will also be in focus; European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is giving a speech on Financial Stability in Madrid this lunchtime. The ECB\u2019s chief economist Peter Praet is also on duty, and speaking at an event on \u201c25 Years of the Association of Banks in Bulgaria\u201d in Sofia, Bulgaria. There may be developments in Greece, where the government has returned empty-handed from Monday night\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Pressure to unlock its next bailout payment in time for debt repayments in June is intensifying. In London, the court battle between Royal Bank of Scotland and irate shareholders who supported its 2008 rights issue continues. Will the investors accept RBS\u2019s last-minute compensation offer, or will they insist on seeing ex-CEO Fred Goodwin in court? The City of London remain subdued in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing, with the FTSE 100 not expected to move much. And it\u2019s a big day for retail news, with Marks &amp; Spencer, Kingfisher and Dixons Carphone all reporting results (more on that shortly).",

The forecasting group\u2019s Daniel Christen and Mark Williams said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was no particular trigger for the move, other than ongoing concerns about the lack of reform momentum in the country\u2019s financial markets...</p> <p>Ultimately, as is often the case with such downgrades, the announcement contained little, if any, \u201cnews\u201d: China\u2019s struggles to bring down leverage, while maintaining rapid economic growth are well-documented, and Moody\u2019s had lowered its outlook for China in March 2016.</p> <p>Bond prices barely moved. Most are purchased overwhelmingly by domestic, state-owned banks, and held to maturity. There was therefore little chance of a spike in yields. And in any case, an A1 rating still puts China well within \u201cinvestment grade\u201d status.</p> <p>Admittedly, excessive credit growth raises the risks of a government bailout out of the financial sector in the event of a severe downturn, which could plausibly add around 35%-pts to the debt ratio. But with only a tiny fraction of China\u2019s debt denominated in dollars, there is little chance of an outright default: the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) can theoretically inflate away the debt. Moreover, while we expect a slowdown in GDP growth, we do not expect a \u201chard-landing\u201d.</p> <p>Equity markets dropped initially \u2013 the Shanghai Composite fell by about 1% on the news \u2013 but had recouped their losses by the end of trading. We have long argued that Chinese equities might face a downward correction once the economy starts to slow, and as the crackdown on leverage begins to bite. But there is little chance of a slump, as P/E ratios are nowhere near the levels reached just during the bubble in the first half of 2015 and not particularly high relative to levels seen at other times in the past.</p> <p>Finally, there appears to have been little pressure on the renminbi. While it might weaken a little this year, we then see it rising again to \u00a56.8/$ in 2018, and \u00a56.5/$ in 2019, as the dollar starts to come under pressure against the other \u201cmajor\u201d currencies, and as the authorities in China permit some appreciation of their currency in trade-weighted terms.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconMarkets/status/867399394194333696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Chinese markets barely reacted to Moody&#39;s downgrade.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s share price has improved 10% since Archie Norman, lately of ITV and once of Asda, was named as the next chairman earlier this month. This show of faith in one non-executive is remarkable, but one can almost understand why it\u2019s happened. After a decade of modernisation programmes under former chief executives Stuart Rose and Marc Bolland \u2013 and another five years in prospect under Steve Rowe \u2013 poor old M&amp;S shareholders must be crying out for a proven outsider\u2019s analysis of where it\u2019s all leading, and how quickly. Since 2012, M&amp;S has clocked up an astonishing \u00a3890m in \u201cadjustments to reported profit\u201d, of which the latest \u00a3437m is the biggest contributor. Needless to say, the adjustments have all been downwards. Beneath the surface, the verdict on Rowe\u2019s first lap of the track is: fine, as far it goes. Pre-adjusted profits fell to \u00a3614m but the new boss can credibly claim to be \u201cpleased with progress\u201d. He hasn\u2019t been diverted from his ambition to get off the treadmill of promotions and sell more clothes more cheaply but at full price. If this strategy is \u201cstarting to stabilise\u201d market share, as he says, it\u2019s a hopeful sign. So is the 8% improvement in cashflow to \u00a3585m. The big doubt in the City, however, is whether Rowe is being bold enough in his plan to close 10% of the floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares. The programme would be radical in one swoop, but this is a five-year goal. In the age of internet shopping, the obvious danger is that market shifts faster than M&amp;S intends to run in clothing. Norman\u2019s verdict is keenly awaited. He probably knows next to nothing about women\u2019s fashion, but he does do \u201cself-help\u201d strategies quickly \u2013 and speed is the quality M&amp;S\u2019s frustrated shareholders are entitled to expect. Berendsen says no Hands off our strategically significant industrial laundromats! As a defence strategy, it wouldn\u2019t wash, as Berendsen, a UK company on the receiving end of a \u00a32bn bid approach from French group Elis, has worked out for itself. Nobody is ever going to be fussy about the ownership of a business that washes workwear clothing and cleans sheets for care homes and hospitality tents. Besides, Berendsen spins two-thirds of its stuff on the continent. Lack of glamour, however, is not an excuse for letting the company slip away on the cheap. Until a profits warning last October, Berendsen was the model of a reliable FTSE 250 index performer. You could have bought at 400p at the start of 2012 and sold last autumn at \u00a313. The profits warning, which related to the UK operations, sent its shares sliding to 750p before a rally to 850p. At that point Elis pounced with a cash-and-shares offer currently worth about \u00a311.60. No way, said Berendsen, and its latest defence tactic is to predict that profits in 2018 will be about \u00a3170m, or about \u00a315m more than the City had expected. That is not a game-changer, but it does underline the opportunistic nature of Elis\u2019s approach. The bidder might equally argue that Berendsen is full of jam-tomorrow tales, the biggest of which is the claimed 15% returns from a three-year \u00a3300m investment in new facilities. That criticism would be fair \u2013 but so is the objection that Elis would be piling on financial leverage in a cross-border deal many times larger than it has attempted in the past. That is a serious shortcoming if you\u2019re expecting the target\u2019s investors to accept part-payment in shares. The risks and rewards, then, are finely balanced. But the French bidder will know how the takeover game is played in the UK: in a tight fight, the surest way to succeed is to put a knock-out offer on the table. Whether Elis can afford to do so is a separate question. But, unless it does, Berendsen investors should stick with what they\u2019ve got \u2013 a company that, in theory, ought to be able to scrub itself up. RBS talks It would be very funny if Fred Goodwin ends up giving evidence in court only because 9,000 retail investors in Royal Bank of Scotland are too disorganised to agree to the bank\u2019s \u00a3200m offer to settle. But such a turn of events would be farcical. The judge in the case, agreeing yet another adjournment, heard the claimants\u2019 QC say that one impediment to a deal was the fact that there are \u201ca small number of shareholders whose current address does not appear to be correct\u201d. Come on, if you\u2019re off to the high court with lawyers\u2019 meters whirring, you check these things in triplicate.",

That criticism would be fair \u2013 but so is the objection that Elis would be piling on financial leverage in a cross-border deal many times larger than it has attempted in the past. That is a serious shortcoming if you\u2019re expecting the target\u2019s investors to accept part-payment in shares.</p> <p>The risks and rewards, then, are finely balanced. But the French bidder will know how the takeover game is played in the UK: in a tight fight, the surest way to succeed is to put a knock-out offer on the table. Whether Elis can afford to do so is a separate question. But, unless it does, Berendsen investors should stick with what they\u2019ve got \u2013 a company that, in theory, ought to be able to scrub itself up.</p> <h2>RBS talks</h2> <p>It would be very funny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/24/high-court-rbs-royal-bank-of-scotland-fred-goodwin\">if Fred Goodwin ends up giving evidence</a> in court only because 9,000 retail investors in Royal Bank of Scotland are too disorganised to agree to the bank\u2019s \u00a3200m offer to settle.</p> <p>But such a turn of events would be farcical. The judge in the case, agreeing yet another adjournment, heard the claimants\u2019 QC say that one impediment to a deal was the fact that there are \u201ca small number of shareholders whose current address does not appear to be correct\u201d. Come on, if you\u2019re off to the high court with lawyers\u2019 meters whirring, you check these things in triplicate.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China\u2019s credit rating has been downgraded by Moody\u2019s for the first time in almost 30 years over fears that slowing growth and rising debts will weaken the world\u2019s second largest economy. The agency lowered China\u2019s sovereign rating by one notch to A1 from Aa3, putting it in the same category as countries such as Japan and Israel. The outlook was raised to stable from negative. Moody\u2019s said the downgrade reflected its expectations that \u201cChina\u2019s financial strength will erode somewhat over the coming years, with economy-wide debt continuing to rise as potential growth slows\u201d. The last time Moody\u2019s cut China\u2019s credit rating was 1989, the same year as the Tiananmen Square protests. The new move frustrated Beijing, where the finance ministry accused Moody\u2019s of overestimating the risks facing the economy. \u201cMoody\u2019s views that China\u2019s non-financial debt will rise rapidly and the government would continue to maintain growth via stimulus measures are exaggerating difficulties facing the Chinese economy, and underestimating the Chinese government\u2019s ability to deepen supply-side structural reform and appropriately expand aggregate demand,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. The downgrade is likely to increase \u2013 if only modestly \u2013 the cost of borrowing for Beijing and Chinese state-owned organisations, and it remains within the investment grade rating range. The negative view initially weighed on Asian markets, commodities and China\u2019s currency on Wednesday. Moody\u2019s said Beijing\u2019s planned economic reforms would not avert a significant rise in debt: \u201cWhile ongoing progress on reforms is likely to transform the economy and financial system over time, it is not likely to prevent a further material rise in economy-wide debt, and the consequent increase in contingent liabilities for the government.\u201d Government stimulus has been a key driver of growth in recent years, but it has also led to a sharp rise in credit and debt levels. Moody\u2019s expects growth to slow to about 5% over the next five years. Last year the Chinese economy grew by 6.7% \u2013 the weakest since 1990. Moody\u2019s also cut the rating of 26 state-owned enterprises by one notch, shortly after the main sovereign downgrade. The list included China National Petroleum Corporation, China Three Gorges Corporation, Guangzhou Metro Group, and Dongfeng Motor Corporation. China\u2019s finance ministry insisted the country\u2019s GDP would continue to grow at medium to high levels \u201c and that will provide fundamental support to fend off local government debt risks\u201d. The ministry added: \u201cChina\u2019s government debt risks will not change dramatically in the period of 2018-20 from 2016.\u201d Moody\u2019s expects government debt to rise to 40% of GDP by the end of 2018, and to 45% by 2020. Luc Froehlich, head of investment directing for Asian fixed income at Fidelity International, said China was facing a number of issues: \u201cThe downgrade is yet another sign of the challenges faced by China, which is juggling rising leverage, declining economic growth rates and ongoing structural reforms. \u201cDespite these mounting pressures, we are confident that China\u2019s central bank and its regulators are firmly in control of the situation.\u201d Chang Liu, China economist at Capital Economics, said activity in the country was likely to slow further in the forthcoming quarters as officials continue their efforts to rein in credit risks. He said a weaker property market could also start to weigh on the wider economy. \u201cThe property sector may also become a headwind to growth in the coming quarters. There are already signs that property sales are cooling due to recently imposed curbs on residential purchases. If this continues, developers may begin to slow the pace of construction.\u201d The sovereign downgrade brought Moody\u2019s into line with Fitch\u2019s rating; Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s rates China one notch above its two rival agencies.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands took to the streets of downtown Chicago on Tuesday night calling McDonald\u2019s the \u201cDonald Trump of corporations\u201d and protesting low wages and sexual harassment at the world\u2019s largest fast food chain a day before the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. The protest, coordinated by pressure groups including Fight for $15, a union-backed lobby group calling for a hike in US minimum wage, plan a second day of protests at McDonald\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in Chicago on Wednesday morning. The marchers, many of them in red ponchos in the driving rain, marched between Trump Tower and the Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll McDonald\u2019s, the company\u2019s flagship restaurant in its hometown. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s just like Donald Trump steals wages from its workers. McDonald\u2019s just like Donald Trump avoids paying taxes. McDonald\u2019s just like Donald Trump supports low wages. McDonald\u2019s just like Donald Trump harasses women,\u201d Fight For $15 national campaign organizer Kendall Fells said. McDonald\u2019s did not return calls for comment. Steve Easterbrook, McDonald\u2019s British-born chief executive, will address shareholders on Wednesday about the company\u2019s turnaround plans. Under Easterbrook the company has bounced back from a years-long slump but faces stiff competition as it attempts to grow its business. Marchers from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Wendy\u2019s and other fast food outlets, along with home healthcare workers and employees of Amazon\u2019s warehouses and other companies, marched on Tuesday and will protest at the fast food giant\u2019s headquarters on Wednesday. Through a series of strikes and protests the Fight for $15 campaign, which aims to raise the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15, has been successful in lobbying for states including California and New York to increase wages. But Trump has offered mixed messages about his stance on the minimum wage, saying that the federal minimum wage is too low but also saying there should be no federal minimum wage at all. Terrence Wise, a McDonald\u2019s worker from Kansas City, Missouri, who came to Chicago for the march, said striking had paid off for him. \u201cBefore I started organizing with Fight for $15 it had been two years since I had a raise,\u201d said Wise, who has worked in different fast food and retail stores since age 16. \u201cAfter the first time I went on strike I got a raise the very next day. Being in the fight and seeing my wage increase slightly has given me hope that we\u2019re doing something right.\u201d Workers rallied outside the new McDonald\u2019s corporate headquarters being built in Chicago\u2019s trendy West Loop, on the site of Oprah Winfrey\u2019s former studios. There, Chicago alderman Carlos Ramirez Rosa charged that taxpayers subsidize McDonald\u2019s since its workers must rely on food stamps and other public assistance. \u201cEvery time McDonald\u2019s fails to provide health care and child care, who do they turn to?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou! McDonald\u2019s, it\u2019s time for you to pay your fair share.\u201d Wise blamed the corporation for perpetuating \u201cintergenerational poverty\u201d. Growing up in South Carolina, he said his mother worked for Hardee\u2019s restaurants for nearly 30 years. \u201cWatching her get up faithfully every morning at 5 am, working hard for years and years, and yet we continued to live in poverty in my childhood,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d come home some days and the lights were off, an eviction notice on the door. Now I see a repeat of it with me and my three little girls and my fiance. We\u2019re working hard every day, I\u2019m working for a very profitable company, and I\u2019m still not being able to provide for my family.\u201d Along with demanding higher wages, the Fight for 15 campaign, supported by the SEIU labor union, is demanding fast food companies recognize workers\u2019 right to organize unions. \u201cWe need a union so we\u2019ve got someone backing us up,\u201d said Betty Douglas of St Louis, who has worked for McDonald\u2019s for 10 years and earns $10 an hour, after previously making $7.90. Organizers said the Chicago march represented the largest yet coming together of groups on different issues relating their struggles to fast food workers\u2019 rights. Women in poverty are more likely to suffer gender-based violence as well as sexual harassment and abuse on the job, advocates noted. \u201cA McDonald\u2019s that respects women would have equal numbers of women in its boardrooms and its kitchens,\u201d said Sheerine Alemzadeh, co-founder of the group Healing to Action. \u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t worry that getting a raise or a promotion would mean complying with a boss\u2019s sexual advances.\u201d And as the largest global buyer of beef, pork, lettuce and tomatoes, they said, McDonald\u2019s is responsible for farmworkers\u2019 exposure to toxic chemicals and the environmental impacts of mass agriculture. \u201cWith all those people combined together we\u2019re hoping to be heard,\u201d said Ashley Bruce, a 22-year-old McDonald\u2019s worker from Chicago and one of the leaders of the march. \u201cNo matter who\u2019s in office, we\u2019re still going to fight for what belongs to us. More and more of us are speaking out and speaking up. We deserve to be respected in the workplace, we deserve $15 an hour and union rights.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Attempts to avert a legal battle that would force the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Fred Goodwin to give evidence in the high court are to continue into next month. The \u00a3520m compensation claim brought by 9,000 retail investors and a handful of major institutions alleges that Goodwin, three former directors and the bank misled them into buying shares during a \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008. Granting an adjournment of the case to 7 June, the judge also set a deadline of 1 June for him to be informed of any agreement over the \u00a3200m settlement being offered by RBS. \u201cWe must have certainty one way or another,\u201d Mr Justice Hildyard told the court. The case had been due to start in central London on Monday and the judge has already granted two 24-hour adjournments to allow shareholders to thrash out a deal with RBS, which made a last-minute settlement offer just before the case was due to begin. Asked by Hildyard what the impediments to a deal were, Jonathan Nash QC for the claimants said the shareholder group was not able to contact all its members. There were a \u201csmall number of shareholders whose current address does not appear to be correct\u201d, Nash said. Nash told the judge that while prospects of a settlement remained good, more time was needed. He said he remained hopeful that it would be possible to reach a deal, blaming \u201clogistical problems\u201d. Nash had told the court on Tuesday the majority of the shareholders were minded to settle but by the end of that day there was no announcement amid a disagreement among some of the private investors who wanted to reject the offer. Some 15% of the group of investors who have yet to agree a settlement have died, 35% are pensioners, and 20% live abroad, according to court documents reported by Bloomberg. The bank has settled with 87% of the shareholders who brought claims relating to the 2008 rights issue, which took place six months before its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. RBS has nearly doubled its offer to the remaining group. While the terms have not been confirmed it is thought the investors in the high court are being offered 82p a share \u2013 worth about \u00a3200m \u2013 compared with offers in the region of 42p agreed with the others. Goodwin has been scheduled to give evidence for two days from 8 June \u2013 the first time since February 2009 that he would be forced to account for this actions at the helm of RBS. Eight years ago, when he appeared before the MPs on the Treasury select committee, he offered a \u201cprofound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused\u201d. The bank\u2019s legal bills are expected to reach \u00a3125m if the case goes through the courts, while the investors\u2019 legal bills are in part being paid by the businessman Trevor Hemmings. There have been reports that Hemmings, owner of Preston North End football club, is willing to accept the RBS offer, but they have not been confirmed. RBS has not accepted liability during previous settlements for investors. It has set aside \u00a3800m for these cases but has said consistently it will defend itself in court.",

As the UK\u2019s largest building society reported a 18% fall in profit to \u00a31bn, its chief executive, Joe Garner, said customers were alert to the economic risks associated with the Brexit negotiations and forecast that house price growth would slow to its lowest pace in four years to 2% in 2017. He said the decision to hold savings rates for some customers had led to them receiving \u00a3380m more in interest than the average market rate and that in total an extra \u00a3500m had been returned to the society\u2019s members through \u201cenhanced pricing\u201d. Garner said: \u201cAs a member-owned organisation we don\u2019t seek to maximise our profits but to manage them in our members\u2019 interests. We make conscious choices about how we distribute our profitability between strategic investment, capital generation and member financial benefit.\u201d The profits of \u00a31bn are at the lower end of the annual range for profits of between \u00a31bn-\u00a31.5bn a year that Garner targeted when he became chief executive last year. He was hired from BT, an unusual move for the Swindon-based mutual that usually hires from within its ranks. The figures for the financial year, which ended on 4 April, also showed a \u00a357m rise in staff costs after more people were hired, pay rises were awarded and contributions made into the pension scheme. An efficiency drive is under way, although Garner played down the need for job cuts. He said the branch network would \u201cevolve\u201d as customers adopted new technology. Competition in the mortgage market also dented profits. Nationwide is the UK\u2019s second-largest mortgage lender and while its total mortgage lending rose 3%, its buy-to-let lending fell by 36% after last year\u2019s move to toughen the terms on which it would lend to landlords. The society has also announced it will stop lending against any new-build leasehold flat or house where the ground rent is more than 0.1% of the value of the property. The society is winning the share of the current account market, in part because of customers switching from the troubled Co-operative Bank. Garner said the Nationwide did not have an interest in acquiring Co-op Bank in its entirety. The Co-op Bank has put itself up for sale and the City is awaiting an update on whether its bondholders and shareholders will put in more cash to help bolster its financial position. Garner is pulling out of selling car insurance and commercial property lending.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has reported a 64% drop in annual profits to \u00a3176.4m as weak clothing sales were compounded by more than \u00a3400m of restructuring costs relating to the new chief executive\u2019s turnaround plan. Chief executive Steve Rowe insisted the retailer was on the road to recovery despite a worsening sales performance in both its clothing and food aisles in the last three months of the financial year. \u201cWe do remain on track,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made some costly but necessary decisions, so profits are down but they are in line with expectations.\u201d Headline pre-tax profits were down 10% at \u00a3613.8m on sales of \u00a310.6bn. But once \u00a3437m of charges, including \u00a3156m relating to pay and pensions changes and \u00a3184m to cover store closures in the UK and overseas, were taken into account, its statutory pre-tax profit dived by 63.5% to \u00a3176.4m. The headline figure was better than analysts were expecting, sending the shares up 1%. M&amp;S\u2019s clothing and homewares sales tumbled by 5.9% in the first three months of 2017, which was far worse than analysts\u2019 expectations of a 3.3% decline. The retailer also reported a weaker-than-expected performance from its food halls, where underlying sales fell by 2.1%. Sales in the fourth quarter were hit by calendar changes that meant key December sales days and Easter fell outside the quarter. Jon Copestake, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said a year into Rowe\u2019s stewardship it was beginning to feel like \u201cgroundhog day\u201d at M&amp;S. \u201cThe retailer faces the same challenges that it has for much of the last decade, notably a structural decline in sales of clothing and homewares as the brand struggles to keep pace with competitors in fast fashion.\u201d Despite the disappointing quarterly figures Rowe pointed to green shoots within its clothing arm, which he will be handing over to Jill McDonald \u2013 who has been poached from car parts and bike retailer Halfords \u2013 in the autumn. \u201cWe are starting to stabilise market share and importantly have seen full price market share growth, as we removed excessive discounting,\u201d said Rowe. McDonald was a surprise appointment as she has never worked in fashion retail but Rowe defended the choice, highlighting her experience at both Halfords and fast food chain McDonald\u2019s. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another buyer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business is not just about picking knitwear, it\u2019s running the buying departments, sourcing operations, logistics and marketing ... it\u2019s a much broader job.\u201d Rowe, who began his retail career aged 15 with a Saturday job at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store and took over as chief executive in April 2016, is seeking to revive the 132-year-old retailer\u2019s declining profits. His biggest job is turning around its clothing arm, which under predecessor Marc Bolland relied on heavy discounting to attract shoppers, but he must also capitalise on the success of its foodhalls, which are in a sweet spot as Britons increasingly visit convenience stores rather than do a big weekly grocery shop. He will also gain the expertise of retail turnaround expert Archie Norman, who is to succeed Robert Swannell as chairman in the autumn. The retailer will trial an online grocery shopping service this autumn, which Rowe said would test its customers\u2019 enthusiam for home delivery. Its foodhalls are different from the major supermarkets as they stock just 7,000 products compared with 40,000 at most Tesco shops. The first part of the trial would involve staff picking orders from the shelves of a small number of shops. \u201cIt\u2019s a trial and we will react to that,\u201d he said. Rowe is facing strong headwinds as he tries to revive M&amp;S\u2019s clothing business. Britons are spending less on clothing at a time when profit margins are being squeezed by the weakness of the pound since the Brexit vote, which is pushing up the cost of imported goods. Rowe described the clothing market as \u201cvolatile and slightly depressed\u201d, while profit margins at its food business are also coming under pressure as inflation bites. He said that while consumers were feeling OK about their personal finances, their view of the economy was more fragile. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have a gap between those two things,\u201d he added.",

But once \u00a3437m of charges, including \u00a3156m relating to pay and pensions changes and \u00a3184m to cover store closures in the UK and overseas, were taken into account, its statutory pre-tax profit dived by 63.5% to \u00a3176.4m. The headline figure was better than analysts were expecting, sending the shares up 1%.</p> <p>M&amp;S\u2019s clothing and homewares sales tumbled by 5.9% in the first three months of 2017, which was far worse than analysts\u2019 expectations of a 3.3% decline. The retailer also reported a weaker-than-expected performance from its food halls, where underlying sales fell by 2.1%. Sales in the fourth quarter were hit by calendar changes that meant key December sales days and Easter fell outside the quarter.</p> <p>Jon Copestake, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said a year into Rowe\u2019s stewardship it was beginning to feel like \u201cgroundhog day\u201d at M&amp;S. \u201cThe retailer faces the same challenges that it has for much of the last decade, notably a structural decline in sales of clothing and homewares as the brand struggles to keep pace with competitors in fast fashion.\u201d </p> <p>Despite the disappointing quarterly figures Rowe pointed to green shoots within its clothing arm, which he will be handing over to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/03/marks-and-spencer-halfords-clothing-jill-mcdonald#img-1\">Jill McDonald</a> \u2013 who has been poached from car parts and bike retailer Halfords \u2013 in the autumn. \u201cWe are starting to stabilise market share and importantly have seen full price market share growth, as we removed excessive discounting,\u201d said Rowe. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/05/marks-and-spencer-fashion-novice-retail\">M&amp;S puts faith in fashion novice from Halfords and retail veteran</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McDonald was a surprise appointment as she has never worked in fashion retail but Rowe defended the choice, highlighting her experience at both Halfords and fast food chain McDonald\u2019s. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another buyer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business is not just about picking knitwear, it\u2019s running the buying departments, sourcing operations, logistics and marketing ... it\u2019s a much broader job.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/03/new-ms-boss-steve-rowe-faces-baptism-of-fire-as-sales-fall\">Rowe</a>, who began his retail career aged 15 with a Saturday job at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store and took over as chief executive in April 2016, is seeking to revive the 132-year-old retailer\u2019s declining profits. His biggest job is turning around its clothing arm, which under predecessor Marc Bolland relied on heavy discounting to attract shoppers, but he must also capitalise on the success of its foodhalls, which are in a sweet spot as Britons increasingly visit convenience stores rather than do a big weekly grocery shop. </p> <p>He will also gain the expertise of retail turnaround expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/05/m-and-s-archie-norman-chairman-marks-spencer\">Archie Norman</a>, who is to succeed Robert Swannell as chairman in the autumn.</p> <p>The retailer will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/this-is-not-just-any-online-grocer-ms-plans-food-delivery-service\">trial an online grocery shopping service</a> this autumn, which Rowe said would test its customers\u2019 enthusiam for home delivery. Its foodhalls are different from the major supermarkets as they stock just 7,000 products compared with 40,000 at most Tesco shops. The first part of the trial would involve staff picking orders from the shelves of a small number of shops. \u201cIt\u2019s a trial and we will react to that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rowe is facing strong headwinds as he tries to revive M&amp;S\u2019s clothing business. Britons are spending less on clothing at a time when profit margins are being squeezed by the weakness of the pound since the Brexit vote, which is pushing up the cost of imported goods. </p> <p>Rowe described the clothing market as \u201cvolatile and slightly depressed\u201d, while profit margins at its food business are also coming under pressure as inflation bites. He said that while consumers were feeling OK about their personal finances, their view of the economy was more fragile. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have a gap between those two things,\u201d he added.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover has delivered a record year of sales bolstered by demand for luxury cars in China and North America. Britain\u2019s biggest car manufacturer sold 604,009 vehicles in the 12 months to the end of March, the most in its 95-year history and 16% more than a year earlier. Growth was strongest in China, where sales jumped 32%, followed by North America, where growth was 24%. Sales were up 16% in the UK and 13% in Europe. The Coventry-based company said growth was driven by demand for newer models such as the Jaguar F-Pace SUV, as well as more established models. \u201cThese solid results demonstrate the appeal of our products and our ability to deliver strong, profitable and sustainable growth,\u201d said Ralf Speth, chief executive. \u201cWe are continuing to invest significantly in new models and innovation, as shown by the new Land Rover Discovery, the forthcoming Range Rover Velar and all-electric Jaguar I-Pace, reinforcing our commitment to new technologies and providing new and compelling customer experiences.\u201d Record sales and a strong fourth-quarter performance drove full-year revenue up 9% to \u00a324bn, generating pre-tax profits of \u00a31.6bn, up 3%. Jaguar Land Rover has been held up by ministers as a poster child for British manufacturing, and is one of the UK\u2019s largest exporters, with about 80% of revenue generated from cars sold abroad. Over the past six years, the carmaker owned by India\u2019s Tata has doubled sales and employment, more than tripled turnover, and invested more than \u00a315bn. During the 2016-17 financial year, the company invested over \u00a33.4 bn, which included \u00a31bn on the construction of its new manufacturing plant in Nitra, Slovakia, and expansion at its UK sites. The company said despite the \u201cvolatile economic environment\u201d, it planned to spend more than \u00a34bn in this financial year on new products, technology, factory expansion and research and development. The company announced in March that the new Range Rover Velar will be built exclusively at its plant in Solihull, West Midlands. Speth said at the time it was a sign of Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s confidence in British manufacturing. \u201cOur heart, soul and headquarters will always be in the UK,\u201d he said. The UK car industry had a record year in 2016, with annual sales of new vehicles at 2.69m. Demand has partly been driven by consumers capitalising on cheap finance deals and those seeking more fuel-efficient vehicles. Industry leaders have voiced fears however about the outlook for UK carmakers once Britain has left the EU. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned in November car manufacturing was at risk of \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d if companies choose to invest in other countries. New car sales fell 20% to 152,076 in April compared with a year earlier. It was the sharpest fall since 2010 as government cuts to subsidies for green cars and a rise in prices hit the market.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two more Labor MPs have taken a stand against the controversial Adani coalmine, with Victorians David Feeney and Peter Khalil expressing objections. Rightwinger Feeney issued a statement on Facebook after a meeting with local activists, declaring the environmental costs of the Adani project \u201ctoo high\u201d. \u201cWhether you look at it financially or environmentally, this project just doesn\u2019t stack up,\u201d Feeney said. He said the Turnbull government should not approve any subsidies to the project \u201cbut, even without this funding, the cost of this project to our future when it comes to the environment and real action on climate change is too high\u201d. Fellow Victorian Khalil, who represents the neighbouring electorate of Wills, has also issued a statement to local activists that points in the direction of outright opposition. The statement says the project should not go ahead \u201cif it doesn\u2019t stack up commercially and environmentally\u201d. \u201cA billion dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money should not be used to prop up this project,\u201d the statement says. The Tasmanian Labor senator Lisa Singh also departed from the official federal ALP position on Adani on Monday, telling Guardian Australia: \u201cIf we are going to be serious about climate change, we should not be starting any new coalmines in this country. \u201cI believe the Adani coalmine is a big mistake for this country. Our future, like India, has to be in renewables.\u201d Singh said she understood the need for jobs in the regions \u201cbut those jobs need to be long-term sustainable jobs\u201d. With an eye on the looming Queensland state election, and on several marginal seats in north Queensland with the potential to decide the next federal election, federal Labor has adopted a position that says the Adani mine can proceed on its merits but the project should not be given federal support. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has argued there is no point having a giant coalmine if you wreck the reef \u201cbut, on the other hand, if the deal does stack up, if the science safeguards are there, if the experts are satisfied, then all well and good and there\u2019ll be jobs created\u201d. The recent breakout by federal Labor MPs follows an intensifying civil society campaign against the project, which is applying pressure to a number of major party MPs in metropolitan areas. A government MP from Queensland, Michelle Landry, acknowledged the pressure being placed on her colleagues in the southern states in a contribution she made during the Coalition party room meeting this week. According to government sources, Landry told colleagues she understood the Adani project was causing grief for government MPs in the southern states but it was important for regional job creation. The Labor breakout also follows a split in the Queensland Labor government about whether the mine should get a royalties holiday. Shorten stepped around the Queensland fight when he spoke to reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m running for prime minister, not for premier,\u201d he said. Shorten said what the state government in Queensland chose to do on royalties for Adani was \u201cultimately a matter for them\u201d. He reiterated Labor\u2019s statements that Adani should not be given taxpayer support. \u201cWe will not use a dollar of the commonwealth taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d Shorten told reporters. \u201cIf the Adani mine is a commercial success, then it doesn\u2019t need the taxpayers to underwrite a $1bn loan for a multibillion-dollar coal company.\u201d",

Our future, like India, has to be in renewables.\u201d</p> <p>Singh said she understood the need for jobs in the regions \u201cbut those jobs need to be long-term sustainable jobs\u201d.</p> <p>With an eye on the looming Queensland state election, and on several marginal seats in north Queensland with the potential to decide the next federal election, federal Labor has adopted a position that says the Adani mine can proceed on its merits but the project should not be given federal support.</p> <p>The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/01/bill-shorten-welcomes-jobs-from-adani-coalmine-but-says-taxpayers-shouldnt-foot-bill\">has argued</a> there is no point having a giant coalmine if you wreck the reef \u201cbut, on the other hand, if the deal does stack up, if the science safeguards are there, if the experts are satisfied, then all well and good and there\u2019ll be jobs created\u201d.</p> <p>The recent breakout by federal Labor MPs follows an intensifying civil society campaign against the project, which is applying pressure to a number of major party MPs in metropolitan areas.</p> <p>A government MP from Queensland, Michelle Landry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/23/australian-conservation-foundation-vows-to-pursue-all-avenues-to-stop-adani-loan\">acknowledged the pressure</a> being placed on her colleagues in the southern states in a contribution she made during the Coalition party room meeting this week.</p> <p>According to government sources, Landry told colleagues she understood the Adani project was causing grief for government MPs in the southern states but it was important for regional job creation. <br></p> <p>The Labor breakout also follows a split in the Queensland Labor government about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/18/adani-offered-320m-deferment-of-carmichael-coal-export-royalties\">whether the mine should get a royalties holiday</a>.</p> <p>Shorten stepped around the Queensland fight when he spoke to reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m running for prime minister, not for premier,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Shorten said what the state government in Queensland chose to do on royalties for Adani was \u201cultimately a matter for them\u201d.</p> <p>He reiterated Labor\u2019s statements that Adani should not be given taxpayer support.</p> <p>\u201cWe will not use a dollar of the commonwealth taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d Shorten told reporters. \u201cIf the Adani mine is a commercial success, then it doesn\u2019t need the taxpayers to underwrite a $1bn loan for a multibillion-dollar coal company.\u201d</p>",
