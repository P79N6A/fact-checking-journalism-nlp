      "bodyText": "\u27ba No big company would dare to forecast its performance over five years. Most executives know it's silly to offer hostages to fortune when there are so many uncertainties. Even City analysts, spreadsheet junkies, tend to look no further than three years when plotting corporate courses. Yet, when it comes to budgets and autumn statements, we are expected to hold our breath as the chancellor unveils hot-off-the-press estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Thus George Osborne on Thursday could trumpet the OBR's new growth forecasts: 1.4% this year \u2013 much higher than March's guess \u2013 to be followed by 2.4%, 2.2%, 2.6%, 2.7% and 2.7% again in 2019-19. Such precision. Unfortunately, its impact was undone in the previous passage where the chancellor said the Office for National Statistics had reassessed the depth of the 2008-09 recession and found the peak-to-trough fall in GDP to be 7.2%, not 6.3% as previously thought. If measuring the past is so tricky, forecasts for what might happen in the next half-decade require a hefty helping of salt. None of which is to suggest that the OBR's predictions are worthless; the Treasury requires a model of the economy and it's a good thing that the OBR works independently. And one can't really blame Osborne for milking the moment for political advantage. But look at the detail of the OBR's projections in two areas \u2013 business investment and exports. This is the crucial territory where the numbers must improve if the recovery is to become more substantial than a housing-induced sugar-rush. The good news is that the OBR expects good news. But take a step back, examine these two graphs and ask yourself: on the evidence of the past (the stuff to the left of the dotted line), do the forecasts (the stuff to the right) strike you as solid? The projections for business investment are, perhaps, credible possibilities because we know surges do happen \u2013 one can clearly see the late-1980s Lawson boom and the late-1990s dotcom and technology excitement. So, on paper, one could construct an argument that we stand on the brink on another sudden uplift and that bosses were just waiting for consumer confidence to return before dipping into the corporate coffers. On the other hand, that jag upwards from 2014-19 looks heroic. As recently as March, the OBR expected a 2% rise in business investment this year; it now thinks the outcome will be minus 5.5%. Yet consistent gains of 8%-plus are still on the cards, apparently. Similarly, on export market share, the chart heads steadily downwards for 15 years and then, miraculously, almost goes sideways for five years. That takes some believing, notwithstanding welcome developments like JCB's big expansion announced on Friday. Sterling, unhelpfully for exporters, is now strengthening. Yes, a \u00a31.5tn economy and a company are very different beasts. Maybe the high hopes will be fulfilled. But if those graphs were presented as part of corporate turnaround plan, the shareholders would be deeply sceptical. \u27ba Aviva's prospects (but not the dividend) started to improve when John McFarlane arrived on the board in 2011. He helped to ditch the unloved chief executive, Andrew Moss. Then he filled that front-line role himself for eight months until promising recruit, Mark Wilson, arrived. And then took up the job of non-executive chairman, the post originally intended. Despite this year's dividend cut, Aviva's message of greater cost-control and concentration on cash sounds more believable this days. So one can understand why FirstGroup, the Aberdeen-based bus and rail firm, would also wish to have the plain-speaking McFarlane as its chairman. FirstGroup, too, is a company recovering from a heart attack. It had a big rights issue this year to tackle sky-high debts and also now preaches a gospel on tighter management. McFarlane, a well travelled Scot, seems a decent pick for chairman, as the 5% rise in the share price on news of the appointment suggested. Harder to understand, though, is why Aviva's board has allowed McFarlane to take another chairmanship at a large company. Aren't big insurers, like big banks, meant to be so important that the chairman, whatever it says in the contract about a three-day week, must be on hand at all times if required? Aviva's crisis, it might be argued, passed when Wilson arrived and a heap of under-powered foreign units were sold. Life may indeed turn out swimmingly, but Aviva retains a big presence in the eurozone, where the crisis looks as if it's been suppressed rather than resolved. It's a little early, surely, for simultaneously chairing another large business. FirstGroup is still a company with 120,000 employees on two continents. McFarlane is an experienced chap, but a chairmanship double-header at two companies that have just left the emergency ward is asking a lot. Aviva's shareholders may note that Paul Manduca, chairman of the Prudential, shuffled off most of his other roles soon after appointment and has accepted no other major gig since. \u27ba Royal Mail watch: the shares briefly touched 600p this week, for a gain of 82% since privatisation in October, or one-third since the first day of trading when business secretary Vince Cable predicted the \"froth\" would blow away. An outbreak of peace between the company and the Communication Workers Union was a mini-trigger for the latest improvement in the share price. So the government, defending itself against the charge of woeful under-pricing of the shares, might argue that factor could not possibly have been foreseen in October. But a successful negotiation was always the way to bet. The two sides never looked far apart and the CWU knew public sympathy for a prolonged strike would be limited. A nurse, for example, might regard Royal Mail's original pay offer of 8.6% over three years, plus legal protections on conditions, as not so bad. \u27ba This is no way to run a pizza joint. Lance Batchelor resigned on Friday as chief executive of Domino's Pizza Group, the UK master franchisee for the US brand. Where's he off to? Domino's seems to want shareholders to play guessing games. \"Lance has been offered a new role in a significant private equity-backed company,\" says chairman Stephen Hemsley. Yes, but which one? \"His new company operates in a non-competing sector.\" This is a high-handed way to treat shareholders, who will pay Batchelor's \u00a3452,000 salary until his departure next April. He has been in the post for only two years. If he has lost his appetite for Domino's so quickly, he should do the courteous thing and say why. In the absence of information, you can't blame investors for assuming Domino's troubles in Germany have worsened and that Batchelor thinks performance-related jackpots are out of reach. Shares fell 9% \u2013 understandably so.",

Those \u2013 like us \u2013, who thought that the Fed wants to get more evidence that the labor market improvement is sustainable, still anticipate that the majority of FOMC members prefer to wait a bit longer before moderating the pace of asset purchases; our baseline view remains that the tapering will be announced at the January meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rob Carnell at ING said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The figures will spur thoughts of an earlier taper \u2013 perhaps December or January. However, despite some more positive noises on the political front, Congressional approval for a budget deal by December 13 could still prove a decisive factor in the Fed\u2019s decision on the timing of the taper. Consequently, whilst the beginning of the end of QE is a little closer following this release, it is not yet a done deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's World First's chief economist Jeremy Cook:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/statuses/408975149455532032\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I&#39;m sticking with the March 2015 taper fwiw.

Here are a few of the most interesting comment pieces:</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy Warner</strong> in the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/10497728/Autumn-statement-2013-George-Osbornes-recovery-is-built-on-sand.html\">Daily Telegraph</a>&#xa0;writes&#xa0;of a sense that growth is borrowed from the future.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The disappointment in this Autumn Statement was that there was so little in it to encourage the fundamental structural shift the UK economy so desperately needs \u2013 away from unsustainable levels of consumption and towards business investment and net trade. This might seem a little unfair; there was welcome relief for small firms on business rates. But like much of what the Coalition has done when it comes to \u201csupply-side reform\u201d \u2013 structural reform that genuinely increases the economy\u2019s productive potential \u2013 it\u2019s scarcely transformational.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Martin Wolf</strong> in the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/592a0dde-5d0d-11e3-a558-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2mh0LFmGH\">FT</a> (metred \u00a3) describes the recovery as needlessly slow.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government had the room to sustain strong fiscal support, but reversed it prematurely. It is not hard to accept that this has affected investment and so potential, as well as actual, output. Furthermore, despite extraordinarily low borrowing costs, in nominal and real terms, net public investment will average 1.5 per cent of GDP between 2013-14 and 2018-19 \u2013 about two-thirds of the share before the crisis, and surely vastly below what the economy needs and can afford. This is just one of many ways in which the obsession with public sector deficits and debt, rather than with the health of the economy and the public sector\u2019s net worth, has led the government astray.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>George Eaton</strong> at <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/12/what-osborne-didnt-mention-wage-growth-has-been-revised-down\">The Staggers</a>&#xa0;points out one set of forecasts George Osborne chose not to mention - wages.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&#xa0;Unlike every other measure, the OBR now expects earnings growth to be weaker, not stronger, than it did at the Budget. The forecast for this year was left unchanged (at 1.5%), while that for next year was revised downwards by 0.2% to 2.6% and that for 2015 by 0.4% to 3.3%. As a result, after already falling by an average of \u00a31,600 since 2010, wages will continue to lag behind inflation in 2014 and will be flat in 2015.&#xa0;</p> <p>The danger for Osborne is that even as the UK grows faster than any other G7 country, most families won't feel the benefits, not least in an economy as unequal as Britain's. Labour will still be able to warn that this is a \"recovery for the few, not the many\" right up until May 2015.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52a1b2c0e4b0a8ed49b80918\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-06T11:21:48.628Z\">11.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Breakthrough in Bali trade talks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/15be3dd0-5e26-11e3-8fca-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2mh0LFmGH\">FT is reporting a breakthrough</a> in global trade talks in Bali.</p> <p>From&#xa0;<strong>Shawn Donnan</strong>, their correspondent in Nusa Dua</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>India and the US resolved their differences over how to push forward with negotiations on food security in the WTO on Friday, clearing the way for the first global trade deal in almost two decades.</p> <p>The agreement, which includes binding rules to clear red tape for goods at borders around the world, marks a significant victory for the World Trade Organisation as a venue to draft the global rules of commerce.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-06T11:29:45.996Z\">at 11.29am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a1af9ce4b0a8ed49b80914\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-06T11:07:25.733Z\">11.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Bali, the trade talks go on, and on.&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MLexGeneva/statuses/408907933800337410\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Latest at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MC9&amp;src=hash\">#MC9</a> : Texts coming out at 20:00 Bali time, HODS also at 20:00. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WTO&amp;src=hash\">#WTO</a></p>&mdash; Jennifer Freedman (@MLexGeneva) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MLexGeneva/statuses/408907933800337410\">December 6, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The time difference makes this 12 midday GMT, but the talks could run into the night, so we could still be waiting late afternoon.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-06T11:14:39.612Z\">at 11.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a1acb8e4b01127dc8a432b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-06T11:04:13.502Z\">11.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>European stock markets are up</strong> this morning, as investors wait for positive US jobs data out later today.

      "bodyText": "Over in Greece, major rallies are planned by public and private sector trade unions to mark tomorrow\u2019s vote in parliament of the 2014 state budget, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Thousands are expected to gather in front of the Greek parliament in Syntagma Square, the arena for anti-austerity protests since the outbreak of the debt crisis, in the count-down to the midnight vote taking place. Both ADEDY, the public sector union and GSEE its private sector counterpart, say the draft budget will only worsen conditions for ordinary Greeks when the vast majority have already lost around 40% of their disposable incomes in the last three years. With private employees worst hit by the crisis \u2013 hundreds of thousands of small and medium sized businesses have been forced to close \u2013 GSEE said the budget, which sees further cuts, would not only trigger higher unemployment but \u201can unprecedented humanitarian crisis.\u201d Close to two million Greeks are currently out of work with at least one in two Greeks unpaid for months according to labour groups. The unions issued their call as thousands took to the streets today to commemorate the police killing of a teenage boy, Alexis Grigoropoulos, in Athens five years ago. Police fired tear gas at school children and students as they marched on parliament to mark the murder. The boy\u2019s death sparked two weeks of widespread riots in Greece in what historians now say was the first concrete sign that all was far from well in the country. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend, and we'll be back on Monday. European markets have ended a downbeat week on an upbeat note. Whether or not the US Federal Reserve will turn off the money taps has been the dominant theme, with shares suffering on fears its $85bn a month bond buying programme might be ending sooner than expected. But even with the better than forecast US non-farm payroll report, investors decided to accentuate the positive aspects of US economic growth for once: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 53.66 points or 0.83% higher at 6551.99 \u2022 Germany's Dax has added 0.96% to 9172.41 \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.72% at 4129.37 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.73% higher at 18,124.39 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 0.09% to 9400.5 * But the Athens market ended 1.09% lower at 1177.34 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 146 points or 0.92% higher. A mini-eurogroup meeting today in Berlin hosted by German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has ended after attempting to find a compromise on how to deal with failing banks. Attendees included other eurozone finance ministers as well as EU financial markets commissioner Michel Barnier and ECB board member J\u00f6rg Asmussen. EUObserver reported: A mini-Eurogroup in Berlin ended as \"one of many working meetings\" ahead of the finance ministers' regular meeting in Brussels next week, an EU commission spokesperson said. Commissioner Barnier and German finance minister Schaeuble are at odds over who should call the shots when a bank needs to be closed. Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Charles Plosser - who does not seem to be a fan of quantitative easing - has told CNBC it is probably time to \"gracefully exit\" the $85bn a month bond buying programme. Speaking after the better than expected non-farm payroll report he said: It's pretty positive clearly. We continue to make solid progress. It would be wise if we began to get rid of this [QE] program. I don't think it's doing very much good for us. It has a lot of unintended consequences and risk for the economy down the road. Plosser will become a voting member of the Fed's open market committee next year. Here are some new global growth forecasts from ratings agency Fitch: Fitch Ratings says in its latest Global Economic Outlook that world growth will accelerate in 2014 and 2015 driven by a more robust recovery in major advanced economies, while emerging market growth rates will improve only modestly. Our latest forecasts for world GDP growth, weighted at market exchange rates, are 2.3% in 2013, firming to 2.9% in 2014 and 3.2% in 2015 (unchanged from the September outlook). \"Although latest trends support our base case that a stronger global expansion is gradually taking hold, several risks lie ahead, including the impact of Fed tapering, emerging market growth stresses, fresh setbacks in the eurozone and the risk of deflation,\" says Gergely Kiss, director in Fitch's Sovereign team. Full story here: Fitch: Global Recovery Taking Hold, But Risks Still Ahead Ireland expects to beat its budget deficit targets this year and next, finance minister Michael Noonan said in London today. He added: We built our budget on the expectation that we wouldn't absolutely achieve our tax estimates for the year for 2013, but it's quite clear now that (we) are going to significantly exceed them. He said the deficit would come in at around 7% of gross domestic product compared to a forecast 7.5%, and would also beat next year's 4.8% target. (Quotes from Reuters) On top of the US jobs figures, consumer confidence has climbed sharply according to a preliminary reading for December. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer confidence index rose from 75.1 in November to 82.5, much higher than the expected 76. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The progressive improvement in the labour market has definitely been supportive for consumer sentiment. We expected the early December spike in fuel prices to have weighed on the overall index but the overall encouraging picture for the labour market seems to have prevailed. US markets have opened sharply higher after the better than expected non-farm payroll and unemployment figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 150 points or nearly 1% as analysts scour the figures for clues as to the US Federal Reserve's next move on its economic stimulus programme. The concensus seems to be at the moment that good news really is good news. Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research, said: We think that the report contains something for everybody: those, who expected the Fed to announce the taper already at the upcoming meeting on December 17/18 will certainly feel vindicated by another 200,000+ employment increase and the further drop in the unemployment rate. Those \u2013 like us \u2013, who thought that the Fed wants to get more evidence that the labor market improvement is sustainable, still anticipate that the majority of FOMC members prefer to wait a bit longer before moderating the pace of asset purchases; our baseline view remains that the tapering will be announced at the January meeting. Rob Carnell at ING said: The figures will spur thoughts of an earlier taper \u2013 perhaps December or January. However, despite some more positive noises on the political front, Congressional approval for a budget deal by December 13 could still prove a decisive factor in the Fed\u2019s decision on the timing of the taper. Consequently, whilst the beginning of the end of QE is a little closer following this release, it is not yet a done deal. And here's World First's chief economist Jeremy Cook: Following 2.21 post: RBS says NatWest website hit by cyber-attack With that I am handing over the blog to Nick Fletcher. A lot of interest has been generated in the Institute for Fiscal Studies' analysis on the cost of living and autumn statement. The IFS take a dim view of the chancellor's spending promises (see 13.26). If you are a PowerPoint fan, you can view their presentations here Dominic Rushe, the Guardian's US business correspondent, has filed this report on the US jobs data. US unemployment falls to lowest level for five years as 203,000 jobs added He writes: But while the jobs report was stronger than expected, problems remain. The unemployment rate for African Americans is 12.5%, more than twice the 6.2% rate for white Americans. For Hispanics the rate is 8.7%. The number of long-term unemployed \u2013 those jobless for 27 weeks or more \u2013 was essentially unchanged at 4.1 million in November. These individuals accounted for 37.3% of the unemployed. The number of long-term unemployed has declined by 718,000 over the past 12 months. More bad news for the Royal Bank of Scotland. After an embarrassing technical glitch on Monday left millions of RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers unable to use their debit cards, it now looks like NatWest has been the victim of a cyber attack. From their press office: More to follow... On top of the jobs data, the US commerce department published figures on consumer spending. These showed that consumer spending was up 0.3% in October, compared to 0.2% in September. Excluding food and energy, the index rose 0.1%, the same as last month. Both these numbers fall below the Federal Reserve's 2% target, which could make policymakers more cautious about reining in the stimulus programme. The strong jobs data raises that long-running question: to taper or not to taper - or will the US Federal Reserve cut back their 85-bn monthly stimulus programme. Over on Forex Live, here is Adam Button's take: For me, the jobs situation is strong enough to taper, or at least strong enough to signal a January taper. The reason not to taper is inflation. PCE inflation (which is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure) fell to 0.7% y/y from 0.9% and core PCE slipped to 1.1% from 1.2% y/y. The dollar is up agains the euro ($1.3629) and the yen (102.73 yen). More details from the US jobs data - full breakdown here. The US economy created 203,000 jobs in November, slightly up on 200,000 the previous month. 196,000 of the new jobs were in the private sector. The unemployment rate was 7%, the lowest rate since November 2008, and significantly lower than the 7.2% economists had forecast. US labour force participation was 63% in November, compared to 62.8% in October Breaking news: the US economy added 203,000 jobs in November, according to the latest data from the Labour department. This was higher than expectations: economists had forecast 180,000 new jobs. The wise heads at the Institute for Fiscal Studies have been giving their assessment on the chancellor's autumn statement. From the Guardian's economics correspondent Phillip Inman The IFS was highly critical of the chancellor's spending promises, including the freeze on fuel duty, introduction of marriage allowances, national insurance cut and cuts in business rates, which will cost \u00a32.5bn, without concrete plans to fund them. On the plan to expand university student numbers by selling the student loan book, IFS director Paul Johnson said: \"This may work in the near term fiscal numbers, but economically it makes little sense. Selling the loan book will be broadly fiscally neutral in the long run, bringing in more money now at the expense of less money later on. Lifting the cap on numbers will cost money every year.\" More broadly, he said, this tactic was a theme of the autumn statement.\"Continuing to announce tax cuts and to make new spending commitments, unfunded beyond 2015/16, can only increase the difficulty of reaching the fiscal he is targeting.\" Johnson has backed Ed Balls' insistence that living standards have fallen in contrast to Osborne's claim that disposable incomes went up last year. He said the survey used by Osborne \"was not something with which to measure living standards\". \"We know from household surveys that income fell sharply in 2010 and 2011. It is almost certainly lower now than it was in 2010.\" But he said it was surprising that household incomes and living standards have fallen given the severity of the slowdown after the crash and the fact that output is still its 2008 peak. Hot off the wires... 13:16:59 RTRS - INDIAN TRADE MINISTER SAYS HE APPROVES OF DRAFT WTO DEAL, REMOVING THE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO HISTORIC TRADE REFORM We are still waiting for that WTO text in Bali, but the Times of India has already declared victory. The paper writes that WTO negotiators will accept India's demands on food security. [These] will protect India and other developing countries from penalties for breaching the domestic support cap of 10% of value of production. In return, the government agreed to a new agreement on trade facilitation, the first since WTO was set up nearly two decades ago, that will ease controls at ports and airports. The endorsement of the draft ministerial remains a formality as trade ministers are set to approve plan after almost 24 hours of behind the scenes dialogue. For India the victory was particularly sweet as it managed to have its way despite major players China and Brazil backing out, leaving South Africa as the only major ally along with Argentina and some large African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria. German industrial orders have slowed down, posting their biggest fall in nearly a year, according to data (German text) from the economy ministry. Factory orders fell back 2.2% in October, after a 3.1% rise the previous month. The change reflects a big drop in bulk orders for investment goods, although orders for consumer goods continued to rise. The ministry said: The trend in demand for industrial goods is still pointing upwards...That indicates a continued positive development in industry for the coming months. Some images from Bali, where people have been protesting against the World Trade Organisation, as negotiators come close to a deal. And a view from inside the talks... From a Finnish diplomat in Bali... The papers have plenty of coverage of yesterday's autumn statement. Here are a few of the most interesting comment pieces: Jeremy Warner in the Daily Telegraph writes of a sense that growth is borrowed from the future. The disappointment in this Autumn Statement was that there was so little in it to encourage the fundamental structural shift the UK economy so desperately needs \u2013 away from unsustainable levels of consumption and towards business investment and net trade. This might seem a little unfair; there was welcome relief for small firms on business rates. But like much of what the Coalition has done when it comes to \u201csupply-side reform\u201d \u2013 structural reform that genuinely increases the economy\u2019s productive potential \u2013 it\u2019s scarcely transformational. Martin Wolf in the FT (metred \u00a3) describes the recovery as needlessly slow. The government had the room to sustain strong fiscal support, but reversed it prematurely. It is not hard to accept that this has affected investment and so potential, as well as actual, output. Furthermore, despite extraordinarily low borrowing costs, in nominal and real terms, net public investment will average 1.5 per cent of GDP between 2013-14 and 2018-19 \u2013 about two-thirds of the share before the crisis, and surely vastly below what the economy needs and can afford. This is just one of many ways in which the obsession with public sector deficits and debt, rather than with the health of the economy and the public sector\u2019s net worth, has led the government astray. George Eaton at The Staggers points out one set of forecasts George Osborne chose not to mention - wages. Unlike every other measure, the OBR now expects earnings growth to be weaker, not stronger, than it did at the Budget. The forecast for this year was left unchanged (at 1.5%), while that for next year was revised downwards by 0.2% to 2.6% and that for 2015 by 0.4% to 3.3%. As a result, after already falling by an average of \u00a31,600 since 2010, wages will continue to lag behind inflation in 2014 and will be flat in 2015. The danger for Osborne is that even as the UK grows faster than any other G7 country, most families won't feel the benefits, not least in an economy as unequal as Britain's. Labour will still be able to warn that this is a \"recovery for the few, not the many\" right up until May 2015. The FT is reporting a breakthrough in global trade talks in Bali. From Shawn Donnan, their correspondent in Nusa Dua India and the US resolved their differences over how to push forward with negotiations on food security in the WTO on Friday, clearing the way for the first global trade deal in almost two decades. The agreement, which includes binding rules to clear red tape for goods at borders around the world, marks a significant victory for the World Trade Organisation as a venue to draft the global rules of commerce. In Bali, the trade talks go on, and on. The time difference makes this 12 midday GMT, but the talks could run into the night, so we could still be waiting late afternoon. European stock markets are up this morning, as investors wait for positive US jobs data out later today. Germany's DAX is doing especially well, with market mood no doubt helped by the upward revision (9.01) to the Bundesbank's jobs forecast. FTSE 100 +0.37% at 6,522.24 points FTSE EuroFirst300 +0.31% at 1,265 points Dax +0.55% at 9,135.21 points CAC+0.28% at 4,111 points The early consensus is that the Bank of England has taken a hit on its flagship forward guidance policy, with a survey showing a rise in the public's inflation expectations. Why is this such bad news for the bank? Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS, reminds us that inflation expectations are one of the bank's three \"knockouts\" under its forward guidance plan. Forward guidance - a pledge to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.5% until the unemployment rate falls to 7% - is the signature policy of Mark Carney, the newish governor . The marked rise in inflation expectations is potentially significant as under the forward guidance scheme that the Bank of England has adopted, a de-anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations is one of the three \u201cknockout\u201d criteria that the bank has set out that could potentially cause it to raise interest rates before the unemployment rate gets down to 7.0%. But he thinks the bank's monetary policy committee won't be too influenced by this for now. Significantly, the survey was carried out during 7-16 November just after most of the energy companies had announced marked increases in their prices which undoubtedly would have had a significant upward impact on inflation expectations... While the Bank of England will not be pleased to see a marked rise in the balance of people expecting interest rates to rise over the next 12 months, they will likely argue that even more people would be expecting interest rate rises were it not for forward guidance given the recent improvement in the economy. More headlines from Ewald Nowotny's press conference in Vienna, where he said the European Central Bank would like new instruments to get funds to small and medium companies. Here are the snaps from Reuters: ECB'S NOWOTNY SAYS HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHERE MONETARY POLICY HASN'T HAD MUCH EFFECT, FOR EXAMPLE FINANCING SMES ECB'S NOWOTNY SAYS WANTS CAPITAL MARKET INSTRUMENTS THAT CAN BE USED AS COLLATERAL AT ECB And some details from Twitter: Is the Bank of England's forward guidance policy working? Data out this morning shows a significant rise in the number of people who expect interest rates to go up. In a survey 34% said they expected rates to rise over the next 12 months, up from 29% in August. The bank points out this is still significantly lower than the the 52% average reading in 2010 when economic growth was last as strong. Some other interesting snippets, the public also expect inflation to rise - the median expectation is for an inflation rate of 3.6% for the coming year, compared with 3.2% in August. Only 18% thought rates should \u2018go up\u2019. The same number thought rates should \u2018go down\u2019, while 38% wanted to keep them as they are. You can read the full report here. The pound has made modest gains this morning, after further evidence of rising UK house prices emerged, buoying sentiment on the UK economy. Sterling was up 0.1% against the dollar at $1.6349 and made a similar gain against the euro with the pound at 83.565 pence. A report from mortgage lender Halifax showed that house prices rose 1.1% in November compared to the previous month. House prices have risen 7.7% this year, leaving the average home valued at \u00a3174,910. Yet another eurozone big cheese has declared an end to recession in the eurozone. Today it is the turn of European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny. Speaking at a news conference in Vienna, Nowotny said every country in the eurozone, barring Cyprus, was expected to grow in 2014. The recession is over for the euro zone. Fiscal policy and monetary policy must give this growth a chance. He also said there was no immediate need for the ECB to act to curb inflation, as expectations on prices were stable. Quotes via Reuters The latest chatter from the trade talks in Bali is that a text will be ready at 6pm local time (10 am GMT). As the talks continue, the World Trade Organisation have flagged up a speech made by Nelson Mandela in 1998 at a Geneva trade meeting. Mandela, almost at the end of his term as South African president, argued that globalisation would only win support if the benefits were fairly distributed. We must start by a reaffirmation that the building of a multilateral rules-based system is fundamentally correct. Powerful economies must stop applying unilateral measures and the developing countries must negotiate their specific needs within this framework... The WTO must be able to facilitate these changes in world production and not be used as a means to revert to protection. The pace of events is rapid and reality requires us to address the so--called new issues, particularly as new pressing matters will emerge and are emerging. But only if there is confidence in the system will all parties feel comfortable doing so. It is therefore imperative that we build confidence in the system. It would be unwise to ignore the increased frustration of ordinary people, or to confuse patience which is exercised in order to ensure an advance, with reluctance to comply. These are complex matters, and in dealing with such matters there are no easy solutions. But where there is a determination to find joint, negotiated solutions then there is a way. The director-general of the WTO Roberto Azevedo has also made his tribute to Mandela. As the Johannesburg exchange pauses trading to Nelson Mandela's death, one Twitter user breaks down some economic stats: It is not only the economists at the OBR who are changing their forecasts. The Bundesbank has raised its growth forecast for Germany this morning, confirming that Europe's largest economy continues to pull away from the rest of the eurozone pack. Germany is expected to grow 0.5% this year and 1.7% next year, a notch up on the Bundesbank's previous forecasts of 0.3% for 2013 and 1.5% for 2014. Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, said: The German economy is in good shape: the unemployment rate is low, employment is rising, and wage growth is returning to normal. These factors are supporting private consumption and driving housing construction. In contrast to George Osborne, who struck a gloomy note about eurozone trade in yesterday's mini budget, Weidmann said an improvement in the eurozone will help German trade to pick up. With the cyclical situation continuing to become brighter in the industrial countries and the emerging improvement in the euro area, there should, however, also be a pick-up in exports and, in their wake, an upturn in corporate investment and imports. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange has said it will pause trading for five minutes at 11.00 (9.00 GMT) to mark the death of former president Nelson Mandela. Could it really happen? After 12 years of talks, trade negotiators are sounding hopeful about reaching an elusive deal on global trade. The World Trade Organisation's spokesman Keith Rockwell told journalists in Bali that prospects were promising: \"we are very close.\" The WTO's director-general Roberto Azevedo, sounded confident about the prospects for success, although he told delegates there was more work to do. As Rockwell said: [Azevedo] told members they were now very close to something that has eluded us for many years and that the decisions over the next few hours would have great significance beyond this day. Quotes from Reuters As the Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott wrote earlier this week, the future of the WTO and the governance of the global economy is at stake. The package on the table would have little real impact on the global economy. On the other hand, failure this week would be a disaster for the WTO, which might continue as the court where trade disputes are settled but would cease to exist as a forum for serious trade liberalisation talks... Free trade is seen as a racket dominated by a particular class interest. Unless that changes and the fruits are more equitably shared, the WTO will continue to stumble from crisis to crisis and globalisation will remain a dirty word. George Osborne has been on BBC Radio 4's Today programme talking about his autumn statement. The message was very familiar: the chancellor talked up \"better economic news\" and those revised forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. I am the first to stay that although the economic plan is working the job isn't done. Asked about when the UK might return to \"normal\" interest rates of 4% or 5%, he didn't have any good news for savers, noting that Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, had set out his forward guidance policy. One of the paradoxes of recovery and of an economic calamity is that the people who pay the price are those \"who have done the right thing and saved\", Osborne said. Asked about his plan to charge capital gains tax on foreigners' UK properties, he did not have an answer about why this had taken so long. He said that after talking to developers he was convinced that \"a move like this would not to huge amounts of damage to investment in Britain\". You can read our full coverage and reaction to the autumn statement here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The main economic event of the day is the publication of US non-farm payroll data. Economists think that the US economy created 180,000 jobs in November, bringing unemployment down to 7.2%. The expectation of these positive figures has put nervy market watchers back on stimulus watch, once again raising expectations that the Fed will start reining in its $85bn-a month stimulus programme. But as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets points out improvements in November are not uncommon, as firms take on more workers around the holiday time. Markets may well be premature in thinking that the Fed will act on a strong number in the knowledge that we could well see a drop off going into December and the New Year. If anything, given how strong payrolls numbers have been in previous years at in November, it would be a surprise if we did not get a strong jobs number. The publication of the US data is likely to be the main economic event of the day, but plenty else is afoot. We could have some eurozone news, with Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem speaking at a conference today. I\u2019ll also be picking up further reaction to George Osborne\u2019s autumn statement.

    "webTitle": "Living standards to be lower in 2015 than in 2010, IFS warns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's leading experts on tax and spending have said that living standards would be lower at the end of the current parliament than at the start, as they backed claims by the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, that family budgets were being squeezed hard under the coalition. Delivering its judgment on George Osborne's autumn statement, the Institute for Fiscal Studies took issue with the way Labour had calculated its estimate of a \u00a31,600 loss to the average family in the three years since the coalition came to power in 2010 but said it was \"pretty consistent\" with survey data showing a big drop in household incomes between 2009-10 and 2011-12. Paul Johnson, the IFS's director, said there was a lack of reliable figures for the current year, but added: \"We do know from household surveys that income fell sharply in 2010 and 2011. It is almost certainly significantly lower now than it was in 2010. \"And while it should start to grow, it will surely still be below its 2010 level by the time we get to the election in 2015.\" Osborne sought to counter Labour's claims this week by using a different way of calculating incomes to show total household incomes rose by 3.9% between their pre-recession peak of early 2008 and the second quarter of 2013. Johnson said the yardstick for household incomes used by the chancellor was not normally used to measure living standards, and an IFS study found that it had failed to detect a squeeze on real spending power in any of the four big recessions Britain has experienced since the early 1970s. \"As a series it [Osborne's measure] behaves quite differently both since 2008 and over long periods of time to other series measuring living standards,\" Johnson said. \"It includes some income which does not accrue to the household sector at all. And its actual construction is opaque. It tells us something about household incomes but it should certainly not be used in isolation to measure how they are changing.\" The IFS said Osborne's adoption of that National Accounts measure of household disposable income meant \"non-profit institutions serving households\", such as universities, were included alongside areas like pension savings, which have declined, freeing up more disposable income. The Balls measure, it added, did not include changes to tax and benefits and used the retail prices index \u2013 no longer considered a reliable gauge of inflation by the Office for National Statistics \u2013 to come up with the statement that real wages had fallen by \u00a31,600. \"That said a \u00a31,600 fall is a fall of about 6%. That is pretty consistent with what we know from survey data happened to household incomes between 2009-10 and 2011-12,\" said Johnson. The IFS director said it was not surprising that household incomes were lower than before the recession and had fallen since 2010. \"We have just lived through the deepest recession in generations and measured output is still below its pre-crisis level. And earnings have been hit particularly hard. In part that is the flipside of the strong employment numbers and is directly related to the apparent fall in productivity.\" The IFS was critical of the chancellor's spending promises, including the freeze on fuel duty, introduction of marriage allowances, national insurance cut and freeze in business rates, costing \u00a32.5bn, without concrete plans to fund them. Of the plan to expand university student numbers by selling the student loan book, Johnson said: \"This may work in the near-term fiscal numbers, but economically it makes little sense. Selling the loan book will be broadly fiscally neutral in the long run, bringing in more money now at the expense of less money later on. Lifting the cap on numbers will cost money every year.\" More broadly, he said, this tactic was a theme of the autumn statement. \"Continuing to announce tax cuts and to make new spending commitments, unfunded beyond 2015-16, can only increase the difficulty of reaching the fiscal balance he is targeting.\" The IFS said the chancellor's plan to balance the budget by 2018-19 involved an acceleration in the pace of spending cuts from 2.3% a year in the five years from March 2011 to March 2016 to 3.7% a year in the three years after that. The thinktank agreed with the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that this would involve shrinking the state to a level not seen since at least 1948. The IFS said this would hold true even if debt interest payments and infrastructure spending were added to the running costs of Whitehall departments. To avoid a stepping up of the pace of spending cuts in the next parliament would require welfare cuts or tax increases worth \u00a312bn, the IFS said. TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"Today's IFS analysis confirms that spending cuts will go on and on as George Osborne makes austerity permanent. \"This has nothing to do with economics, but is all about a rightwing political project. \"The chancellor is using the fallout from the global recession to permanently cut services and shrink the state back to where it was in 1948. \"This is not what voters want. They may have accepted the need for harsh medicine in the wake of the crash, but they want a cure that delivers rising living standards, decent services and a fair economy.\" Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"It's an embarrassing blow to the chancellor that his favoured measure of living standards turns out to include the incomes of charities and universities. The IFS is also right to question whether George Osborne's sums for future years really do stack up.\"",

In part that is the flipside of the strong employment numbers and is directly related to the apparent fall in productivity.\"</p> <p>The IFS was critical of the chancellor's spending promises, including the freeze on fuel duty, introduction of marriage allowances, national insurance cut and freeze in business rates, costing \u00a32.5bn, without concrete plans to fund them.</p> <p>Of the plan to expand university student numbers by selling the student loan book, Johnson said: \"This may work in the near-term fiscal numbers, but economically it makes little sense. Selling the loan book will be broadly fiscally neutral in the long run, bringing in more money now at the expense of less money later on. Lifting the cap on numbers will cost money every year.\"</p> <p>More broadly, he said, this tactic was a theme of the autumn statement. \"Continuing to announce tax cuts and to make new spending commitments, unfunded beyond 2015-16, can only increase the difficulty of reaching the fiscal balance he is targeting.\"</p> <p>The IFS said the chancellor's plan to balance the budget by 2018-19 involved an acceleration in the pace of spending cuts from 2.3% a year in the five years from March 2011 to March 2016 to 3.7% a year in the three years after that.</p> <p>The thinktank agreed with the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/05/government-spending-cuts-budget-deficit\" title=\"\">would involve shrinking the state to a level not seen since at least 1948</a>. The IFS said this would hold true even if debt interest payments and infrastructure spending were added to the running costs of Whitehall departments.</p> <p>To avoid a stepping up of the pace of spending cuts in the next parliament would require welfare cuts or tax increases worth \u00a312bn, the IFS said.</p> <p>TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"Today's IFS analysis confirms that spending cuts will go on and on as George Osborne makes austerity permanent.</p> <p>\"This has nothing to do with economics, but is all about a rightwing political project.</p> <p>\"The chancellor is using the fallout from the global recession to permanently cut services and shrink the state back to where it was in 1948.</p> <p>\"This is not what voters want. They may have accepted the need for harsh medicine in the wake of the crash, but they want a cure that delivers rising living standards, decent services and a fair economy.\"</p> <p>Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"It's an embarrassing blow to the chancellor that his favoured measure of living standards turns out to include the incomes of charities and universities. The IFS is also right to question whether George Osborne's sums for future years really do stack up.\"</p>",

The 21st century has seen a dramatic shift in \"traditional\" family dynamics and greater recognition of gender in legislation has helped pull apart gender-role divisions. As a result women are far more economically independent and socially autonomous, representing 42% of the UK workforce and 55% of university graduates. Yet women are still less&#xa0;likely than men to be associated with leadership positions in the UK: they account for 22% of MPs and peers, 20% of university professors, 6.1% of FTSE 100 executive positions, and 3% of board chairpersons. This stark inequality is consistently reflected in pay gaps, despite the introduction of the Equal Pay Act in 1975. Income inequality has risen faster in the UK than any other OCED country and today women earn on average \u00a3140,000 less than men over their working careers.&#xa0;</p> <p>In recent reports 2.4 million unemployed women said that they want to find employment, and nine out of 10 people want to see men and women equally represented in leadership positions. If the intention to change is there, and basic social and political frameworks support women in the workforce, then we need to look beyond facts and figures to establish what other factors contribute to the gaping hole in gender equality. While statistics offer insights into current patterns and behaviours, they do not address why the skills and talents of women are not being fully utilized.</p> <p>A relatively neglected factor is the role of stereotypes, reinforced by social and cultural norms, which underline certain expectations about gender. Decades of research has shown that stereotypes about men and women have a huge impact on our beliefs about how they should (or should not) behave. Consequently gender stereotypes reinforce social status and gender hierarchies: for example, surveys and experiments show that women are generally perceived as more \"communal\" and \"loyal\", whereas men are described more as \"protectors\" and \"competent\". Of course not everyone subscribes to these stereotypes, but there is evidence that men and women who behave in ways that contrast with these traditional stereotypes \u2013 such as career women or stay-at-home dads \u2013 are likely to be evaluated negatively by others. A lifetime of exposure to what women should be, how they should behave and who they should represent drives and reinforces unconscious and unseen biases.</p> <p>Unconscious bias is particularly important as it arises from the implicit assumptions and unspoken attitudes, beliefs and expectations that we all have about others. Study after study has highlighted that both men and women have unconscious gender biases. For example, people view men as more capable leaders, men are rewarded more highly than women \u2013 just having a male name is more likely to get you the job. If you are a mother, your chances of getting the job are reduced by 70%. Overcoming stereotypes and unconscious bias can only be achieved if we are all willing to address our own immediate judgments and can put in place practices and procedures to mitigate their potential effects.</p> <p>When we pair the psychological evidence with the economic facts, the argument for gender equality is overwhelming. Research consistently shows that groups perform to a higher standard if the gender balance is even, or when women outnumber men. For example, Catalyst research found that companies with high-level female representation on boards significantly outperformed those with sustained low representation by 84% on return on sales, 60% on return on invested capital, and 46% on return on equity. The Women's Business Council predicts that we could add 10% (that is over \u00a3150bn) to our GDP by 2030 if all the women that wanted to work were employed.</p> <p>In the long term encouraging women to participate in the labour market is vital to ensure economic growth at both micro and macro level. As we face an increasingly ageing population and the resulting shortage of skilled workers, it is fundamental that we also depend on high female employment and high wage returns in order to manage the skills deficit.</p> <p>We are taking bigger and bigger steps towards providing more flexible workplaces, better parental leave policies and more chances for women to get back into the workplace. But these opportunities are wasted if our stereotypes and biases distort the way we evaluate others, and often to their disadvantage.</p> <p>\u2022 Abigail Player is a PhD student at the Centre for the Study of Group Processes at Kent university's school of psychology.</p>",

For example, people view men as more capable leaders, men are rewarded more highly than women \u2013 just having a male name is more likely to get you the job. If you are a mother, your chances of getting the job are reduced by 70%. Overcoming stereotypes and unconscious bias can only be achieved if we are all willing to address our own immediate judgments and can put in place practices and procedures to mitigate their potential effects. When we pair the psychological evidence with the economic facts, the argument for gender equality is overwhelming. Research consistently shows that groups perform to a higher standard if the gender balance is even, or when women outnumber men. For example, Catalyst research found that companies with high-level female representation on boards significantly outperformed those with sustained low representation by 84% on return on sales, 60% on return on invested capital, and 46% on return on equity. The Women's Business Council predicts that we could add 10% (that is over \u00a3150bn) to our GDP by 2030 if all the women that wanted to work were employed. In the long term encouraging women to participate in the labour market is vital to ensure economic growth at both micro and macro level. As we face an increasingly ageing population and the resulting shortage of skilled workers, it is fundamental that we also depend on high female employment and high wage returns in order to manage the skills deficit. We are taking bigger and bigger steps towards providing more flexible workplaces, better parental leave policies and more chances for women to get back into the workplace. But these opportunities are wasted if our stereotypes and biases distort the way we evaluate others, and often to their disadvantage. \u2022 Abigail Player is a PhD student at the Centre for the Study of Group Processes at Kent university's school of psychology.",

The ATS runs from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2020 and includes capped assistance of $1.5bn from 2011 to 2015; capped assistance of $1bn from 2016 to 2020; and uncapped assistance of approximately $847m.</p> <p>Macfarlane has been in touch with Holden executives this week and believes the company is yet to make a final call on the Australian business.</p> <p>Macfarlane told Guardian Australia the government wanted a strong manufacturing sector and a \"sustainable car industry.\"</p> <p>Abbott's call for Holden to clarify its future comes as the inquiry into the car industry established by his government has only just begun. The Productivity Commission is not due to deliver its interim findings until 20 December and it has until the end of March 2014 to deliver its final report.</p> <p>Macfarlane said the Productivity Commission would complete its current work. \u201cThe government has made clear from day one the timetable for its response, and neither Holden nor Toyota have raised any concerns about that timetable. Consultations are continuing in good faith with Australian car makers, the components industry and workers.\"</p> <p>\u201cThese consultations will continue as the Productivity Commission prepares its interim findings, ahead of a full report next March, and a government response by mid 2014.\u201d</p> <p>The managing director of Holden, Mike Devereux, is not due to give evidence to the PC inquiry until next Tuesday, 10 December, although the carmaker has made a written submission which says that continued industry assistance is needed to win $1bn in investment needed to keep its Australian manufacturing operations open after 2016.</p> <p>A Holden spokesman has refused to comment on the most recent ABC report quoting unnamed senior Abbott ministers saying that a decision has already been made for Holden to stop making cars at its Adelaide plant: \u201cWe do not respond to speculation. Our discussions with government are continuing.\u201d</p> <p>The South Australian secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, John Camillo, said Devereux had addressed workers at the Adelaide assembly plant on Thursday, telling them that employees would be the first to hear if any decision was made on the future of the plant.</p> <p>Devereux has been promoted to a regional management role with General Motors, based in Singapore. But he told Holden workers that he would continue to run Holden at the Australian operation until at least February, when a new appointee takes over.</p> <p>Camillo said he had spoken to the SA premier, Jay Weatherill, who had been told by Holden that no decision had been made to shut the plant.</p> <p>But the union leader said he walked the factory floor early Friday morning and that workers were \"pretty emotional\" about the latest speculative reports quoting an unnamed senior Coalition minister saying that Holden has already made a decision to shut the plant. He said senior figures in the Abbott government appeared to want GM to make a decision, allowing them to argue \"hang on, GM left of its own accord\u201d.</p> <p>ACTU secretary Dave Oliver called for urgent action from the government, warning that the PC inquiry could turn into an inquest into the death of the local car industry.</p> <p>Shadow industry minister Kim Carr has meanwhile urged the government to desist from a \u201cfactional fight\u201d and focus on agreeing on a plan to shore up Holden. \u201cWe understand that no decision has yet been made by GM Holden, however it is on a knife\u2019s edge.\u201d</p> <p>Car industry sources say that Holden's parent, the US auto giant General Motors, has noted the government's lukewarm stance to its Australian presence, and that the parent is leaving it to local management to try to put in place a survival package.</p> <p>While there is opposition to continued taxpayer assistance to the car industry among the government's economic dries, there is strong support among state-based Coalition MPs in South Australia and Victoria.</p> <p>The car industry supports about 45,000 direct jobs, with proponents arguing that it sustains about 200,000 jobs overall.</p> <p>The closure of Holden's assembly plant in Adelaide would be a massive blow to the SA economy and there is a state election in mid-March at which the Coalition is keen to oust the incumbent Labor administration.</p> <p>Victoria has a state election in November 2014, while massive job losses in the car industry would also colour the next federal election due in 2016.</p>",

The ATS runs from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2020 and includes capped assistance of $1.5bn from 2011 to 2015; capped assistance of $1bn from 2016 to 2020; and uncapped assistance of approximately $847m. Macfarlane has been in touch with Holden executives this week and believes the company is yet to make a final call on the Australian business. Macfarlane told Guardian Australia the government wanted a strong manufacturing sector and a \"sustainable car industry.\" Abbott's call for Holden to clarify its future comes as the inquiry into the car industry established by his government has only just begun. The Productivity Commission is not due to deliver its interim findings until 20 December and it has until the end of March 2014 to deliver its final report. Macfarlane said the Productivity Commission would complete its current work. \u201cThe government has made clear from day one the timetable for its response, and neither Holden nor Toyota have raised any concerns about that timetable. Consultations are continuing in good faith with Australian car makers, the components industry and workers.\" \u201cThese consultations will continue as the Productivity Commission prepares its interim findings, ahead of a full report next March, and a government response by mid 2014.\u201d The managing director of Holden, Mike Devereux, is not due to give evidence to the PC inquiry until next Tuesday, 10 December, although the carmaker has made a written submission which says that continued industry assistance is needed to win $1bn in investment needed to keep its Australian manufacturing operations open after 2016. A Holden spokesman has refused to comment on the most recent ABC report quoting unnamed senior Abbott ministers saying that a decision has already been made for Holden to stop making cars at its Adelaide plant: \u201cWe do not respond to speculation. Our discussions with government are continuing.\u201d The South Australian secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, John Camillo, said Devereux had addressed workers at the Adelaide assembly plant on Thursday, telling them that employees would be the first to hear if any decision was made on the future of the plant. Devereux has been promoted to a regional management role with General Motors, based in Singapore. But he told Holden workers that he would continue to run Holden at the Australian operation until at least February, when a new appointee takes over. Camillo said he had spoken to the SA premier, Jay Weatherill, who had been told by Holden that no decision had been made to shut the plant. But the union leader said he walked the factory floor early Friday morning and that workers were \"pretty emotional\" about the latest speculative reports quoting an unnamed senior Coalition minister saying that Holden has already made a decision to shut the plant. He said senior figures in the Abbott government appeared to want GM to make a decision, allowing them to argue \"hang on, GM left of its own accord\u201d. ACTU secretary Dave Oliver called for urgent action from the government, warning that the PC inquiry could turn into an inquest into the death of the local car industry. Shadow industry minister Kim Carr has meanwhile urged the government to desist from a \u201cfactional fight\u201d and focus on agreeing on a plan to shore up Holden. \u201cWe understand that no decision has yet been made by GM Holden, however it is on a knife\u2019s edge.\u201d Car industry sources say that Holden's parent, the US auto giant General Motors, has noted the government's lukewarm stance to its Australian presence, and that the parent is leaving it to local management to try to put in place a survival package. While there is opposition to continued taxpayer assistance to the car industry among the government's economic dries, there is strong support among state-based Coalition MPs in South Australia and Victoria. The car industry supports about 45,000 direct jobs, with proponents arguing that it sustains about 200,000 jobs overall. The closure of Holden's assembly plant in Adelaide would be a massive blow to the SA economy and there is a state election in mid-March at which the Coalition is keen to oust the incumbent Labor administration. Victoria has a state election in November 2014, while massive job losses in the car industry would also colour the next federal election due in 2016.",
