      "bodyText": "A strong and properly regulated free-market economy is the only way to guarantee higher living standards, Theresa May will say on Thursday as she contrasts her economic approach with the call for more state control made by Labour at this week\u2019s conference. In a speech to mark the 20th anniversary of the independence of the Bank of England, the prime minister will insist that there are benefits from an open and innovative economy \u2013 provided it is reformed and properly regulated. \u201cA free-market economy, operating under the right rules and regulations, is the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created,\u201d May will say. \u201cIt was the new combination which led societies out of darkness and stagnation and into the light of the modern age. It is unquestionably the best, and indeed the only sustainable, means of increasing the living standards of everyone in a country.\u201d May has favoured a more interventionist approach since succeeding David Cameron as prime minister in July 2016, announcing support for an industrial strategy and saying that her mission was to create a Britain that worked for those \u201cjust about managing\u201d as well as the better off. But living standards have been falling this year as a result of wages failing to keep pace with the price increases caused by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote 15 months ago, leaving the government vulnerable to attacks from Labour on its handling of the economy. In a sideswipe at Corbyn likely to be followed by a more concerted assault at next week\u2019s Conservative party conference in Manchester, the prime minister will attack an ideological approach to running the economy. \u201cWe should never forget that raising the living standards, and protecting the jobs, of ordinary working people is the central aim of all economic policy. Helping each generation to live longer, fuller, more secure lives than the one which went before them. Not serving an abstract doctrine or an ideological concept, but serving the real interests of the British people.\u201d The prime minister will contrast her belief in open and innovative markets with the more state-dominated approach favoured by Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow chancellor at this week\u2019s Labour party conference. Corbyn believes the hung parliament that resulted from June\u2019s general election demonstrates that voters have tired of the spending cuts that have formed a central part of economic policy since 2010. May\u2019s government has slowed the pace of deficit reduction and on current plans it will take until the middle of the next decade for the budget to be balanced. But she is expected to say that it would not be in the best interests of working people to abandon deficit reduction altogether and that a balanced approach is needed. \u201cThat means continuing to deal with our debts, so that our economy can remain strong and we can protect people\u2019s jobs. At the same time, it means investing in our vital public services, like schools and hospitals, which our successful management of the economy has made possible. \u201cTo abandon that balanced approach with unfunded borrowing and significantly higher levels of taxation would damage our economy, threaten jobs, and hurt working people. Ultimately, that would mean less money for the public services we all rely on.\u201d May began her career at the Bank of England 40 years ago, and her speech will also discuss how the nature of central banking has changed over the past 30 years with its new defining characteristics being \u201copenness and transparency\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "HBOS must have known of Reading fraud, Thames Valley PCC says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The police and crime commissioner of Thames Valley police has claimed that HBOS must have known of the fraudulent activities inside its Reading branch as long ago as February 2008. Six individuals, including two former HBOS employers, were jailed earlier this year for committing the fraud, described by the judge as an \u201cutterly corrupt scheme\u201d that left small business owners cheated, defeated and penniless. Anthony Stansfeld told a meeting attended by 150 people on Wednesday that it had still taken the bank \u2013 rescued by Lloyds following the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 a decade to offer compensation to the 67 companies affected. Sitting alongside TV celebrity Noel Edmonds, who is claiming \u00a3300m from Lloyds for the damage caused to his company, Stansfeld also told the audience that Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, had rescinded an offer to meet to discuss concerns the commissioner was raising about the banking sector after he had received briefings on the matters. The Cabinet Office had not responded to a request for comment on the claim about Heywood at the time of publication. [See footnote.] Stansfeld said: \u201cIt must have been known quite clearly to the directors of the bank as far back as February 2008 that a massive fraud had taken place [at HBOS Reading].\u201d The scam took place between 2003 and 2008 and involved a former HBOS employee, Lynden Scourfield, who was in charge of looking after troubled businesses. He was bribed by David Mills, the owner of a financial consultancy, to load loans on to struggling companies and refer them to Mills\u2019s business. Many of the firms went bankrupt and some of the owners lost their homes. Victims of the fraud were among those attending the meeting in Conway Hall in central London organised by the SME Alliance, a campaign group for small business fronted by Nikki Turner, who, with her husband Paul, lobbied for the HBOS Reading branch to be investigated. Some of those present have also claimed they were badly treated by Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s now defunct global restructuring group, which was supposed to help turn around businesses in trouble but has been accused of running them into the ground. The hall heard Edmonds explain that he had a copy of the report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority into the division which the regulator was refusing to publish. Edmonds said he had been warned by Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, that if he published the report, it would be a criminal offence. The FCA would not comment directly, but had made a similiar point to Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, which is also calling for the so-called section 116 report to be published. He said he had heard that RBS could collapse under the weight of claims if the report was published. \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the publication of the report is in the victims\u2019 interest,\u201d he added, but said it was a complex question. The Deal or No Deal host said that Antonio Horta-Osorio, the boss of Lloyds since 2011, must have known about the HBOS fraud and said he was either a \u201cshit banker or a liar\u201d. He is going to mediation with the bank on 11 November over his claim. Lloyds said it was cooperating with an investigation by the FCA into the discovery and reporting of misconduct at HBOS at the time. The bank has commissioned an independent review from retired judge Dame Linda Dobbs into whether Lloyds could and should have done more after the acquisition of HBOS. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: \u201cWhile concerns regarding the misconduct of certain HBOS individuals were identified, there was not sufficient evidence to establish criminal behaviour. The police and regulators were the appropriate authorities to conduct the investigation.\u201d Edmonds said there was a \u201ccancer in our financial institutions\u201d that had deliberately targeted small businesses to raise cash during the financial crisis. Stansfeld said Thames Valley police had not been paid back any of the \u00a37m it had cost the force to conduct the HBOS Reading investigation, and called for the fines levied by the FCA to be paid to police forces to fund fraud investigations. Since the Libor crisis in 2012, the fines have gone to the Treasury rather than the FCA. \u2022 After publication, the Cabinet Office provided the following response: \u201cThe Cabinet Secretary was in correspondence with Mr Stansfeld and encouraged him to pursue his allegations through the appropriate channels.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Google price comparison site to compete with rivals for top search slot", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Google\u2019s price comparison service will compete with rivals for the right to appear at the top of the search engine\u2019s home page, in an effort to comply with an European Union anti-trust ruling. Google Shopping will also operate as a separate business, seeking to make a profit, albeit it will continue to be part of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. The changes, introduced from Wednesday, are an attempt to answer the EU\u2019s claim that the Google shopping service could always outbid others for the advertising space at the top of the site, as its cash would not be leaving the wider company. The shopping service will have its own accounts, which it will provide to the European commission to scrutinise, and there will be Chinese walls within the company to ensure it gains no competitive advantage, Google said. The tech giant was forced to make the change after the European commission ruled in June that it had been artificially and illegally promoting its own price comparison service in searches, denying consumers real choice and rival firms the ability to compete on a level playing field. Google was set a deadline of 28 September to change its practices, or face huge daily fines. The company is appealing against an initial \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) fine tabled by the commission last June as a consequence of the ruling. The commission has been aware of Google\u2019s plan since August but Brussels has not given any indication as to whether the change goes far enough. Competitors in the price comparison market are not expected to find the change acceptable, however, and there is talk of a boycott of the internet search engine\u2019s auctions. Such an outcome would mean Google\u2019s shopping services ads would continue to monopolise the top of the site. It is understood that of 300 price comparison sites, only about a dozen have so far agreed to take part in auctions for the advertising spots at the top of its search page. Al Verney, a spokesperson for Google, said that whatever the outcome the company had provided a level playing field that should satisfy the European regulator. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re implementing a remedy to comply with the European commission\u2019s recent decision. \u201cWe\u2019re giving comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show shopping ads from merchants on Google\u2019s search results pages as we give to Google Shopping. \u201cGoogle Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else.\u201d From Wednesday evening, users searching for products may notice a small change to the advertising panel at the top of the search screen that shows pictures of products with links to retailers\u2019 websites. Instead of Google\u2019s shopping comparison service monopolising all the slots, the name of the price comparison site that has won the ad space auction will be displayed below the picture of whatever product is being sought by the user. The commission\u2019s fine of \u20ac2.4bn was said to take into account the \u201cduration and gravity of the infringement\u201d, and was based on Google\u2019s revenue from its comparison shopping service in the 13 countries where the illegality occurred. It was claimed by Brussels that Google\u2019s illegal promotion of its shopping service caused traffic to it to jump 45-fold in the UK, 35-fold in Germany and 19-fold in France. The changes brought in by Google will only be seen by users of the search engine in the European Economic Area (EEA).",

The company is appealing against an initial \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) fine tabled by the commission last June as a consequence of the ruling. <br></p> <p>The commission has been aware of Google\u2019s plan since August but Brussels has not given any indication as to whether the change goes far enough.</p> <p>Competitors in the price comparison market are not expected to find the change acceptable, however, and there is talk of a boycott of the internet search engine\u2019s auctions. Such an outcome would mean Google\u2019s shopping services ads would continue to monopolise the top of the site.</p> <p>It is understood that of 300 price comparison sites, only about a dozen have so far agreed to take part in auctions for the advertising spots at the top of its search page.</p> <p>Al Verney, a spokesperson for Google, said that whatever the outcome the company had provided a level playing field that should satisfy the European regulator.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe\u2019re implementing a remedy to comply with the European commission\u2019s recent decision.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re giving comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show shopping ads from merchants on Google\u2019s search results pages as we give to Google Shopping.</p> <p>\u201cGoogle Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>From Wednesday evening, users searching for products may notice a small change to the advertising panel at the top of the search screen that shows pictures of products with links to retailers\u2019 websites.</p> <p>Instead of Google\u2019s shopping comparison service monopolising all the slots, the name of the price comparison site that has won the ad space auction will be displayed below the picture of whatever product is being sought by the user.</p> <p>The commission\u2019s fine of \u20ac2.4bn was said to take into account the \u201cduration and gravity of the infringement\u201d, and was based on Google\u2019s revenue from its comparison shopping service in the 13 countries where the illegality occurred.</p> <p>It was claimed by Brussels that Google\u2019s illegal promotion of its shopping service caused traffic to it to jump 45-fold in the UK, 35-fold in Germany and 19-fold in France.

The US company is a $150bn (\u00a3112bn) titan whose business is underpinned by a cosy relationship with the country\u2019s Department of Defense and a near-duopoly with Airbus in the market for large commercial aircraft. It is grumbling about state-aid for a firm a fraction of its size. It is behaving like a bully. As Delta Air Lines, the US customer for the order at the centre of the dispute, has argued, Boeing these days doesn\u2019t make commercial aircraft as small as the 100-seaters it wants. In theory, an invigorated Bombardier, if it was able to extend its C-series planes, might mount a challenge to the US firm\u2019s 737s one day. But that prospect is distant. Boeing\u2019s motivation in pursuing this case is probably twofold. First, causing serious financial damage to Bombardier may discourage more dangerous up-starts, such as Chinese and Russian firms who can summon larger sums than the $1bn the Canadian company secured from the provincial Quebec government in 2015. Second \u2013 and more significantly \u2013 Boeing\u2019s lawyers will have been encouraged by President Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric. It is useful for them to know what the language means in practice. A lot, it turns out: the 219% tariff slapped on Bombardier\u2019s planes for Delta after the ruling by the US Commerce Department is far stiffer than expected. This dispute has a long way to run, of course. In the second stage, Boeing must demonstrate it has suffered material harm.

Lobbying Trump has achieved nothing so far, as Theresa May, and also Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, have discovered. Threatening Boeing with loss of UK defence contracts has merit but, as the US firm is always quick to point out, it employs 12,000 people in the UK. It is hard to see what other tactics UK and Canadian politicians can deploy. Delta could encourage other US airlines to shout support for Bombardier, but has presumably done so already.

What to make of Labour plans for City Business leaders may never take up the Jeremy Corbyn chant but, like everyone, they can see that the possibility of the Labour leader becoming prime minister is real. So, while there was predictable hostility to passages in Corbyn\u2019s speech in Brighton, reactions from business lobby groups carried a strong strain of \u201clet\u2019s talk\u201d. Try this from Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI: \u201cWhere Labour has sought insight from business, such as on its policy for Brexit and investment in infrastructure, we have seen sensible proposals that support jobs and living standards.\u201d Specifically, the CBI would like to talk about nationalisation and business taxes. Good idea \u2013 a conversation might suit both sides, if only so that we can all have a better idea of what is being contemplated. On nationalisation, Labour has sown confusion this week with its stance on private finance initiative contracts. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said they would be brought \u201cback in-house\u201d and seemed to mean all 700-plus contracts. Labour\u2019s briefing notes said the contracts would be taken over \u201cif necessary\u201d, which is a different proposition, possibly to the tune of several tens of billions of pounds in up-front costs. What\u2019s the policy? On utilities, we\u2019ve heard little beyond the fact that Labour is in favour of public ownership \u201cto put them at the service of our people and our economy and stop the public being ripped off\u201d. That there are scandalous examples of rip-offs hardly requires debate. The water industry, which Corbyn highlighted, has seen egregious examples of off-shore owners collecting big dividends for little risk while executives are paid life-changing sums. Why, though, has the option of installing better regulators under a tougher regulatory system been rejected? It would be cheaper to execute and the gains for consumers might be more certain and arrive more quickly, as even an unfriendly business voice might be able to demonstrate. There is also a question of priorities. Nationalising the railways, the water companies, the energy companies and the Royal Mail would be a huge undertaking.

    "webTitle": "UK government threatens retaliation against Boeing in Bombardier tariff row - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The day has been dominated by the ructions following the US decision to slap 219% tariffs on Bombardier, the result of a dispute with rival Boeing. Here\u2019s our latest report: The government has warned aircraft manufacturer Boeing it could lose UK defence contracts over its part in a US decision to slap punitive tariffs of 219% on rival Bombardier, in a dispute that threatens to sour trade relations between London and Washington. Theresa May said she was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d by the move to impose a tariff on sales of Bombardier\u2019s C-Series passenger jet, which threatens at least 1,000 manufacturing jobs in Northern Ireland. Michael Fallon, the UK defence secretary, stepped up the government\u2019s rhetoric, warning that Boeing\u2019s assault on Bombardier \u201ccould jeopardise\u201d its chances of securing government contracts. The business secretary, Greg Clark, joined the chorus of disapproval, branding the ruling \u201cunjustified\u201d and vowing to work with Canada - where Bombardier is based - to get it overturned. The backlash follows an interim decision by the US Department of Commerce, which agreed with Boeing\u2019s case that Bombardier received unfair, anti-competitive state support from the Quebec regional government, including a \u00a3740m bailout. Bombardier, which has also received \u00a3113m in repayable funding from the UK government, called the decision \u201cabsurd and divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programmes\u201d. The full story is here: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s our full report on Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s departure from his role as German finance minister: Here\u2019s Foster\u2019s tweet on her talks with Theresa May over Bombardier jobs: Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionists, has said UK prime minister Theresa May has given a commitment to work to secure jobs in Belfast following the Bombardier row. The DUP of course have an important position in UK politics, given they are now propping up May\u2019s government in Westminster. Donald Trump\u2019s proposed US tax reforms have given some support to markets, but investors remain to be fully convinced the US president will be able to pass these latest plans given his legislative difficulties so far in his term. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: While the headlines are sure to focus on the tax cuts for rich individuals, the market focus will no doubt centre on the planned corporate tax cut which has the potential to sharply impact profitability throughout the market. With a hawkish Yellen and the prospect of a US economic boom, it comes as no surprise that the dollar has been a big outperformer of late. While the prospect of lower taxes promise a bounty for stocks, it is worth noting that Trump has yet to deliver on any major policies given the constant rebuttals from the Republican dominated Congress. There is a good chance that these tax reforms are going to be as difficult to pass at the health reforms, with issues such as the controversial border adjustment tax likely to provide significant hurdles along the way. There is also some notable caution thanks to the continuing concerns about the tensions between the US and North Korea. Even so, European markets managed to end the day in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 27.77 points or 0.38% higher at 7313.51 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.41% to 12,657.41 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.25% at 5281.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB gained 0.85% to 22,622.19 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.76% ahead at 10,368.9 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.5% to 736.64 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently flat on the day. Over to German politics again, and if the Greek government is celebrating the prospect of Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble leaving as finance minister, the joy may be short-lived. ING says: UK defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has ruled out cancelling existing orders with Boeing over the Bombardier dispute. But he pointedly added that there were other contracts which Boeing was expected to bid for in the future. Earlier Fallon told reporters in Belfast that the UK\u2019s current relationship with Boeing could be damaged by the row and even suggested the UK might decline to buy Boeing products in future. Now he has told Reuters the UK would not cancel orders from Boeing for nine P-8 spy planes and 50 Apache helicopters but added: \u201cWe know they will be back at the door.\u201d Here\u2019s the statement from Boeing, courtesy of the Press Association: We have heard and understand the concerns from the Prime Minister and the Government about Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. Boeing is committed to the UK and values the partnership, which stretches back almost 80 years. The company has doubled its direct employment in the UK since 2011 and tripled its spending with more than 250 companies in the UK supply chain over the same period, to 2.1 billion in 2016. More than 18,700 jobs in the UK are at Boeing or in the company\u2019s tier one supply chain. Earlier this month Boeing broke ground for its first factory in Europe, in Sheffield. We are pleased to work with our partners, including the British Government, and provide such a vote of confidence in the UK. Any claimed economic threat to Bombardier is due to the weakness of its product in the marketplace, which explains its desperate action that prompted the ITC case due to Bombardier\u2019s decision to violate US trade rules. Boeing welcomes competition and Bombardier can sell its aircraft anywhere in the world. But sales must be made according to globally-accepted trade rules. We believe that global trade only works if everyone abides by the same rules of the road, and that\u2019s a principle that ultimately creates the greatest value for Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our respective aerospace industries. Boeing\u2019s petition to the International Trade Commission seeks to restore a level playing field in the US single-aisle airplane market. Boeing had to take action as subsidised competition has hurt us now and will continue to hurt us for years to come. With US refineries restarting after the closures caused by Hurricane Harvey, crude stocks fell by 1.8m barrels last week, compared to expectations of a 3.4m increase. But gasoline stocks rose by 1.1m barrels, rather than the 750,000 fall expected. More on the dollar. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A better than expected durable goods order reading, and the prospect of Trump\u2019s tax speech this evening, allowed the dollar to maintain its post-Yellen growth this Wednesday. Ahead of Trump\u2019s appearance in Indiana details have been leaked about his proposed tax plan, the headlines being a lowering of the corporate rate from 35% to 20%, and a reduction to the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%. The Republicans want to push through these tax reforms in part to distract from their complete and utter failure at repealing Obamacare. They face myriad obstacles, however, not least a Democratic Party who\u2019ll be keen to hammer home the point that the proposed changes favour the country\u2019s wealthiest members, something that might not go down well with the President\u2019s key base of support. Regardless, the prospect of progress on one of Trump\u2019s market-wooing election promises has helped the dollar keep hold of most of its daily growth. The greenback was further shored up by a decent durable goods order figure, which came in at 1.7% against the 1.0% forecast and the miserable -6.8% the month previous. This all meant cable was pinned back at $1.34 after a 0.3% fall, with the euro suffering a 0.6% drop, taking the weary currency to a fresh, sub $1.175 one month nadir. Against the yen, which has been shaken in recent weeks by the North Korea situation, the dollar found even greater success, briefly hitting a 10 week peak of \u00a5113. Ryanair is back in the headlines with its latest cancellations, and affected passengers are already having to rethink their plans. Henry McDonald writes: There is more airplane-related trouble for Northern Ireland on top of the Boeing versus Bomdardier battle and it comes in the shape of Rynair. The budget airline has announced on Wednesday afternoon that it is suspending its Belfast to Gatwick route from November to March. The Belfast-Gatwick route is Ryanair\u2019s most popular airlink to Britain in Northern Ireland. Among those affected by the four month cancellation of flights is former Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon who tweeted today that her flight had been cancelled. A West Belfast choral society from the parish of St Agnes\u2019s will have to change their 60th anniversary bash in London in November. And here is a list of the affected routes: Back with Bombardier, and Ulster Unionist peer Lord Empey, vice chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Aerospace, has slammed Boeing for \u201cbully boy tactics\u201d and said the disputed subsidy was in fact a loan: The launch aid that was provided to Bombardier which came via Treasury is repayable on the basis of royalties from sales so it is effectively a loan. Throughout my time as DETI and DEL Minister I am content that all transactions with Bombardier were consistent with EU State Aid rules. In the United States both cities and states give very substantial tax incentives and breaks to Boeing and other manufacturers. The majority of the C Series aircraft, by value, is actually produced in the US like the engine and avionics to name but two. What I see the core of this dispute being, given that Boeing did not even tender for the Delta Airlines contract, is an attempt by Boeing \u2013 and in Europe, Airbus \u2013 to suffocate Bombardier. It is bully boy tactics. The manufacturing of the C Series sees a dramatic increase in efficiency and a reduction in fuel consumption that would mean when oil prices rise the plane becomes much more significant. It is not the current version of the plane that is the target \u2013 it is the long term project and what flows from it that has got Boeing in particular so aggravated. In the markets, shares are edging higher but investors remain cautious thanks to the continuing tensions between North Korea and the US and ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s latest tax proposals. The dollar is moving higher following the hints from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen that US interest rates could rise again as early as December. In turn that has helped lift European markets as a weaker pound and euro gives a boost to exporters. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.44%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.57% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.34%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.13% better. Earlier US durable goods orders climbed by 1.7% in August, better than the 1% analysts had been expecting. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: A sense of anticipation can be felt across the financial markets ahead of President Trump\u2019s tax proposal in Indiana later today. Although some information has been leaked that corporate tax may be lowered to 20% from 35%, market players are still likely to closely scrutinise the speech for further details on tax reforms. If legislation is passed this year, this should boost sentiment towards the US economy and support the Dollar further. Back with the reports that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is stepping down as German finance minister: Over in Canada, the 219% tariff imposed by the US on Bombardier has been described as an attack on the country. Quebec premier Philippe Couillard told reporters: \u201cQuebec has been attacked. And Quebec will resist. And Quebec will unite. All together we will protect our workers. All together we will be proud of our engineering.\u201d He said Quebec had taken a $1bn stake in Bombardier\u2019s C Series plane but had not received any government subsidies. Back with the row over Bombardier, and Boeing said it understands the UK\u2019s concerns but blames its rival\u2019s \u201cweak products.\u201d A spokesman told Reuters that the company was committed to the UK and it had heard and understood the concerns of the UK government over Bombardier\u2019s workers in Northern Ireland. But it added that any claimed economic threat to Bombardier was due to the weakness of its product in the marketplace. Earlier Boeing said in a statement: Global trade works only if everyone plays by the rules that we\u2019ve all endorsed to ensure fair competition, as adjudicated by independent national and international bodies. This dispute has nothing to do with limiting innovation or competition, which we welcome. Rather, it has everything to do with maintaining a level playing field and ensuring that aerospace companies abide by trade agreements. The process that will continue to play out over the next several months at the International Trade Commission and Commerce is the longstanding, transparent course for examining and addressing situations where products are \u2018dumped\u2019 into the United States at below-cost prices for the purposes of gaining market share. We have full confidence that this will continue to be a fair and fact-based investigation, and we look forward to its conclusion early next year. In the wake of the weekend\u2019s general election in Germany, there are now reports that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble will be stepping down as finance minister to become president of the country\u2019s parliament. Sch\u00e4uble was first elected 45 years ago and is the longest-serving MP in the Bundestag. He has been finance minister since 2009, and was heavily involved in the bailout deals with Greece, albeit he had a fractious relationship with the struggling country. At one point he is believed to have said the heavily endebted Greece should leave the eurozone. A decade after the financial crisis, the global economy is still vulnerable to another crash. So says the World Economic Forum today, in a new report into global competitiveness. WEF warns that some banks are actually less sound than they were before the credit crunch struck in 2007, triggering the near-collapse of the financial system. The Fund says: After a long period of low growth following the global financial crisis, the world economy appears to have picked up speed. This is welcome news. Yet despite this gradual improvement, policymakers in many countries are concerned about the prospects for longterm economic development. This is partly because the current expansion appears to be cyclical, bolstered by exceptionally low interest rates rather than by the fundamental drivers of structural growth. Productivity improvements appear to remain sluggish and are not expected to return to the levels experienced in past decades. The report also showed that Britain has dropped to 8th, from 7th, in WEF\u2019s list of competitiveness. WEF says Britain\u2019s \u2018macroeconomic environment\u2019 is a concern (that\u2019s a reference to the UK\u2019s growth, inflation and unemployment situation). It warns that this situation could deteriorate further after the UK has left the European Union. The United Kingdom (UK) (8th) falls one spot. This drop does not yet reflect the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, which is likely to further undermine the country\u2019s competitiveness. Currently the country performs very well on technological readiness and the sophistication of its business sector (4th and 7th overall). Its macroeconomic environment remains challenging (68th) and could become an important constraint in the future as the timeline for a reduction of the fiscal deficit is repeatedly pushed back. The full report is online here. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has just told his party conference in Brighton that the tariffs imposed on Bombardier C Series planes threaten \u201cthousands of jobs\u201d. Corbyn says that Theresa May must use Britain\u2019s special relationship with America to protect the company\u2019s workers in Northern Ireland. Thousands of jobs are now at stake, thousands of jobs at risk A Prime minister betting our eocnomic future on a deregulated trade deal with the US might want to take a moment to explain how 220% tarifsf are going to boost our exports from this country. Are you one of the 400,00 people whose Ryanair flight has just been cancelled? If so, Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice: \u201cIt\u2019s so disappointing for Ryanair passengers whose flights have been cancelled, even with more notice this time it\u2019s still seriously frustrating. Ryanair are still in a mess here, but you shouldn\u2019t be left out of pocket. \u201cIf your flight has been cancelled, ask for a refund. You should get your money back within 7 days or given an alternative flight. This should also apply to connecting flights you miss as a result, as long as they were booked together. \u201cAside from this, generally if your flight is delayed by over 3 hours you can claim compensation for the inconvenience. Cancellation amounts vary from \u20ac250 to \u20ac600 depending on your flight. \u201cIf your other travel plans are impacted, look to your travel insurance for cover. This is when having a decent policy can really come in handy.\u201d Wow! Breaking away from Bombardier.... budget airline Ryanair has just extended its flight cancellation programme, affecting an additional 400,000 passengers. Ryanair is cancelling 34 routes until next year, in a fresh attempt to tackle its rostering crisis that has left it without enough pilots. Those affected are being offered a refund or an alternative flight. It\u2019s a big u-turn; just last week, CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said he hoped to avoid further cancellations. The UK government is rolling out the big guns against Boeing, with the defence secretary dropping an unsubtle hint that Britain could retaliate. Sir Michael Fallon has told reporters in Belfast that the UK\u2019s current relationship with Boeing could be damaged by the row. He even suggests that London might decline to buy Boeing products in future: Fallon says: \u201cThis is not the behaviour we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardise our future relationship with them. \u201cBoeing has significant defence contracts with us and still expects to win further contracts. Boeing wants and we want a long term partnership but that has to be two-way. Boeing is an important investor in the United Kingdom and an important employer in the United Kingdom but we would prefer this kind of issue to be settled on a negotiated basis. \u201cThis is not the kind of behaviour that we expect from along-term partner and I\u2019ve made that very clear to Boeing. (Thanks to Reuters for the quotes). Boeing\u2019s military arm produces a wide range of equipment, including Apache attack helicopters, Chinook transport helicopters and surveillance planes. As this infographic shows, Boeing also employs or supports more than 10,000 jobs in the UK; any tit-for-tat retaliation could affect them. Last night, Delta argued that Boeing\u2019s case lacked merit, because it simply doesn\u2019t make an aircraft that competes directly with Bombardier\u2019s C Series: St\u00e9phane Lessard, the consul general of Canada in Denver, warned that imposing steep tariffs on Bombardier could backfire. Here are some photos of Bombardier staff working on C Series aeroplane wings: Back in Belfast, a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly has revealed he has family members employed at the Bombardier plant in East Belfast, and that he fears for their future job prospects. Chris Lyttle of the cross community Alliance Party is an East Belfast representative in the deadlocked Stormont Assembly. Lyttle said: \u201cThis was an astounding ruling but it is important to remember it is only preliminary. The US International Trade Commission must now find as Boeing did not compete for the Delta contract awarded to Bombardier C Series and does not serve this market, no injury has occurred. \u201cI have constituents, friends and family employed by Bombardier and I am acutely aware of the concern that exists amongst staff. Alliance has already engaged on this issue with the most senior levels of the UK, US and Canadian Governments and we will continue to do so, to work to achieve a fair outcome and protect the thousands of jobs in our aerospace manufacturing sector and economy. \u201cThis ruling could have severe implication not only for jobs in NI but for international trade with the United States, particularly in the aerospace sector. The UK government is turning up the pressure on Boeing. Business secretary Greg Clark says that the US planemaker\u2019s complaint against Bombardier is simply \u201cunjustified\u201d, and vowed to work with Canada to reverse last night\u2019s preliminary ruling. We will work completely hand in glove with the Canadian government to get this overturned. Clark also believes that the final ruling in this dispute, due next year, should be in Bombardier\u2019s favour. The Trade Commission needs to look to see if there\u2019s been any detriment to Boeing.. There hasn\u2019t been, as this aircraft doesn\u2019t compete with Boeing. Labour MP Conor McGinn, who was born and brought up in Northern Ireland, says the Bombardier dispute shows that Britain is stronger within the European Union. \u201cHard Brexit campaigners in Government keep promising that Britain will get a great new trade deal with the US after we leave the EU. That\u2019s how they justify their ideological choice to leave the Single Market and Customs Union. \u201cBut now we see the US Government taking a decision which is totally against our economic interests and could put thousands of jobs at risk across the UK, especially in Northern Ireland. \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on a good trade deal with the US being agreed after Brexit. To protect jobs and our economy, we need to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union to preserve trade with our largest market \u2013 the EU.\u201d Paul Adams, head of aerospace at management consultancy, Vendigital, reckons that the Bombardier-Boeing dispute will take some time to resolve: \u201cBoeing\u2019s legal challenge may in part be influenced by Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policy. The US manufacturer could be seeking to test the new administration\u2019s resolve when it comes to protecting US jobs against foreign competitors selling to US customers. \u201cAs history shows, trade disputes in the aerospace sector can become protracted - the Boeing / Airbus dispute ultimately had to be resolved by the World Trade Organisation. It is likely that Bombardier will appeal the US court\u2019s decision, before the final hearing in 2018. Manufacturing Northern Ireland, a trade body, have blasted the US tariff decision -- and warned that Britain could be more exposed to such rulings after it leaves the EU: In other news: UK retail sales have grown at their fastest pace in two years this. That\u2019s according to the latest CBI Distributive Trades Survey, which suggests consumers are still spending despite rising inflation and weak wages. It\u2019s a volatile survey, though, so.... The DUP\u2019s Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has repeated his warning that Boeing could be hit by retaliatory sanctions. Donaldson, who is the party\u2019s chief whip, tells Sky News: Boeing do sell a lot of aircraft to the UK, and to Canada, and to other countries. The US government has to weigh that in the balance as well. We think there is still a strong case to be made for Bombardier, and believe that common sense will prevail in the end. Q: So you would support tit-for-tat sanctions? Canada has made clear that they will impose import restrictions against Boeing, Donaldson replies. It\u2019s too early to say what the UK should do, he adds. He also disputes the suggestion that the row has anything to do with Brexit, pointing out that Britain is still in the EU today. I can\u2019t believe that the US president wants to take an entirely protectionist approach against its closely ally, Donaldson adds. Q: What are the implications for Northern Ireland if this preliminary decision is upheld? It would be a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to Bombardier if they were priced out of the US market, and we would struggle to keep the jobs in Belfast, Donaldson warned. Labour\u2019s shadow industrial strategy minister, Chi Onwurah, has also heavily criticised Theresa May over the Bombardier tariff ruling. Onwurah told Sky News: It\u2019s a damning indictment of the criminal negligence and complacency of Theresa May and her government, and a sign of their entire lack of international negotiating skills which bodes really badly for our post-Brexit negotiations. Worryingly, the value of Bombardier\u2019s corporate bonds has fallen this morning. That means traders believe the risk that the Canadian firm defaults on its debts has risen. Bloomberg has the details: Bombardier Inc.\u2019s euro-denominated bonds maturing in 2021 have declined the most in more than two years after the U.S. imposed import duties of 220 percent on the company\u2019s C-series plane, threatening to upend deliveries of more than $5 billion to Delta Air Lines Inc. next year. The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer\u2019s senior unsecured notes are currently down by more than seven price points at 99.963, according to Bloomberg prices at 10am London time. The notes had already fallen 2.2 points on Tuesday -- the same day that competitors Siemens AG and Alstrom SA agreed to join their rail businesses. That bond has been one of the top 10 most actively traded in the European secondary bond market, according to MarketAxess subsidiary, Trax. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may comment on the Bombardier news when he addresses the Labour Party conference at noon today. Liberal Dem Leader Vince Cable has accused America of \u2018protectionist bullying\u2019 over the Bombardier ruling. He is urged Theresa May to stand alongside Canada\u2019s government in refusing to accept the new tariffs lying down. Cable says: \u201cRather than simply expressing \u2018bitter disappointment\u2019, our government should be out there fighting for vital British manufacturing jobs in Belfast. May must support Trudeau\u2019s administration in standing up to protectionist bullying from Donald Trump and his crude \u2018America First\u2019 philosophy. Do we really believe the US will save us from Brexit with a comprehensive trade deal, when this is how they deal with fair and free international competition?\u201d Workers at the Bombardier aerospace factory in Northern Ireland have admitted they are shocked and stunned by America\u2019s decision. The news that a tariff of 220% will be imposed on Bombardier\u2019s jet sales to Delta airlines has come a a big blow to the workforce, who make wings for the C Series planes. Geordie Burnside, a shop steward, says the size of the tariff - effectively tripling the cost of the C Series jet - has taken everyone by surprise. Burnside, who has worked at the factory for 26 years, told the Guardian that: \u201cI\u2019ve been getting phone calls from early morning asking why the ruling had slapped down such an enormous tariff. They cannot believe the enormity of it or get their heads around it. There have been a lot of tough times at this factory over the last 26 years and we got through. I hope that the company will appeal and the battle isn\u2019t over yet. Burnside also warned that the decision has big ramifications for Northern Ireland\u2019s economy: \u201cThere are highly skilled jobs inside this plant which is the biggest manufacturer in Northern Ireland. Thousands of other people\u2019s jobs outside of Bombardier depend on this company too. There are a lot of worried people out there not only in Northern Ireland but the Republic and Britain who supply into Bombardier. It\u2019s a very worrying time.\u201d The Press Association have written a handy Q&amp;A on the trade dispute between Bombardier and Boeing. What is the row about? It centres on US-based Boeing\u2019s allegations that Canadian-headquartered Bombardier received state subsidies allowing it to sell its C-Series planes at below-market prices in America. The DoC has carried out its own investigation and said it had made a preliminary determination that imports should be subject to a 219.63% import tariff, although it will continue to evaluate the figure. If the tariff is imposed when deliveries of the aircraft begin it will increase the cost of selling into one of the world\u2019s most important aviation markets. Bombardier is contracted to supply up to 125 C-Series aircraft to Atlanta-based Delta Airlines in a deal underpinning many staff posts at its manufacturing plant in Belfast. The UK Government has been actively lobbying in the US for a compromise between Boeing and Bombardier amid growing concern about the potential implications for Bombardier\u2019s Northern Ireland operations. What are the aerospace companies saying about it? Boeing submitted a petition with the US International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce in April which claimed large government subsidies helped Bombardier launch an aggressive campaign to \u201cdump\u201d its C-Series aircraft in the US. It said there was a shared industry interest in a level playing field. Bombardier has repeatedly rejected Boeing\u2019s claims, accusing its rival of pure hypocrisy after it alleged anti-competition practices in the sale of aircraft. The manufacturer described the DoC\u2019s interim determination as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cdivorced from the reality about the financing of multi-billion-dollar aircraft programmes\u201d. What are the implications for Belfast? Bombardier had been under financial pressure and invested large sums in its new jet programme, which is crucial to many jobs in the city. Last year the firm announced 1,080 job losses at its Northern Ireland plants following delays to the C-Series. It is one of the country\u2019s largest employers, with around 4,500 on the books. According to the GMB union it supports nearly 10,000 further jobs through its suppliers. What is the Government doing about it? Political powersharing at Stormont has been in cold storage for months. However the DUP\u2019s 10 anti-Brexit MPs are a crucial force propping up the Government in key votes after Theresa May lost her majority in this year\u2019s General Election. DUP leader Arlene Foster\u2019s influence has seen the Prime Minister lobbying US President Donald Trump during a recent visit to New York. Following the DoC\u2019s announcement the UK Government said it would \u201ccontinue to strongly defend UK interests\u201d and labelled Boeing\u2019s position as \u201cunjustified\u201d. More from Labour\u2019s shadows secretary of state for Northern Ireland: Northern Ireland\u2019s devolved government collapsed in January, and the region\u2019s political parties haven\u2019t yet agreed a new power-sharing setup. The CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s business leaders, has warned that this deadlock is hurting the economy. Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland Director, says: \u201cBombardier makes a huge contribution to the Northern Irish economy. They are a major regional employer and support a wider supply chain that stretches across Northern Ireland. \u201cThe decision by the US Department of Commerce represents a challenge to the Northern Ireland economy and places an important driver of regional economic growth at risk. \u201cThis just reinforces the need for the swift return of an inclusive devolved government. Government and business must work in partnership to deliver a new far-reaching industrial strategy to improve regional resilience, economic competitiveness and facilitate growth. \u201cWith jobs and future prosperity in the region being put at risk by decisions made far away from Belfast, we need a devolved government that can speak up for and champion the needs of the local workers and businesses most affected.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack has done a good blogpost explaining the issues around the Boeing-Bombardier case. In it, he points out that Boeing has received plenty of money from the US government over the years. Can it really complain about other companies getting subsidies with a straight face?! The deal with Delta to supply up to 125 planes was the largest order yet for its big hope, the C-Series, but an order only made possible, say Boeing, by absurdly low pricing made possible by Canadian and UK government subsidies. While it is true that Bombardier has received billions from the government of Quebec and the state\u2019s pension fund, Boeing has received more, a lot more, from the US military, Nasa and the State of Washington over many decades. Boeing would argue these were commercial arrangements, others would call them padded contracts amounting to subsidies. Jack adds that Theresa May is in a bind. She needs Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP to back her in parliament, but she can\u2019t really afford to upset a major employer like Boeing either.... Boeing issued a polite but firm reminder to Theresa May that it employs 16,500 people in its UK supply chain and last week broke ground on a new facility in Sheffield. The Prime Minister may find it difficult to keep her new best friends in the DUP sweet while not offending such an important employer in the rest of the UK. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Labour MP Owen Smith, shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, has heavily criticised Theresa May\u2019s government. He says they were \u2018criminally negligent\u2019 for not persuading the US to reject Boeing\u2019s claim. Smith also points out that the decision suggests cracking a new trade deal with America after Brexit will be tough: Conservative MP Anna Soubry, a vocal opponent of Brexit, has also tweeted about the ruling: Unions are blaming Theresa May for not persuading Donald Trump to reject Boeing\u2019s claim. Ross Murdoch, of the GMB union,says the PM was: \u201casleep at the wheel when she could and should have been fighting to protect these workers. It\u2019s high time she woke up\u201d. Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionists, also said the Department of Commerce\u2019s decision was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. Foster says: \u201cThe CSeries is a hugely innovative aircraft that is vital to Bombardier\u2019s operations in Belfast. It is this innovation that sets the C-Series apart and it is not in direct competition with Boeing. The Department of Commerce released its ruling against Bombardier last night - you can see it online here: U.S. Department of Commerce Issues Affirmative Preliminary Countervailing Duty Determination on Imports of 100- to 150-Seat Large Civil Aircraft From Canada It argues that Bombardier has received subsidies from the Canadian government on the C-Series planes that it has sold to the Delta airline, worth 219%. So, it is ordering US Customs and Border Protection to collect cash deposits on every plane shipped into America - effectively tripling the cost. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross says the Trump administration won\u2019t tolerate illegal subsidies: \u201cThe U.S. values its relationships with Canada, but even our closest allies must play by the rules. The subsidization of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump Administration takes very seriously, and we will continue to evaluate and verify the accuracy of this preliminary determination.\u201d Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner called on the government to protect the thousands of Bombardier workers in Belfast. She stressed that the UK had followed the rules and added that the government \u201cneeds to be robust in their defence of that\u201d. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe Bombardier situation is quite a crucial one because these are UK jobs that we depend on, thousands, and actually the government were involved in that contract process and were robust and I think that we have to defend the fact that that contract was awarded and we followed the rules. \u201cAt times Jeremy [Corbyn] talks about sometimes the global rules don\u2019t benefit UK jobs, but actually we followed the rules, we got that contract fair and square and the government must ensure that we protect those jobs to ensure that we can keep our businesses running.\u201d Q: There are reports that Canada may retaliate by imposing a block on Boeing imports into Canada. Should Britain hit Boeing with reprisals too? Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP says it is too early to consider this, as we\u2019ve only had the preliminary decision from the US Department of Commerce. But he drops a hint that the UK could hit back, saying Theresa May is \u201cputting down a marker\u201d by criticising the decision so strongly today. If Boeing want to do business in the UK, they need to stop acting in such an unreasonable and irrational way against an aircraft that is innovative and isn\u2019t in direct competition with Boeing. If America is about free trade and free enterprise, it really shouldn\u2019t be doing this. Reminder: Donaldson\u2019s position is significant, as the DUP are now propping up Theresa May\u2019s government in Westminster. Q: Are you pessimistic or optimistic about Bombardier\u2019s chances in this dispute, Sir Jeffrey? I believe David can defeat Goliath, Donaldson shoots back. Q: What did Trump say to Theresa May about this dispute? At that stage, they were waiting for the interim decision, replies Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. He\u2019s sure they\u2019ll speak again now the decision is out. Donaldson adds: He [Trump] has adopted in the past a protectionist approach to US business. But we believe strongly in this case that it isn\u2019t about protectionism because Bombardier and Boeing were not competing for the Delta aircraft [contract]. We think the C-Series is not in direct competition with Boeing. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, a Democratic Unionist Party MP, is also on the Today Programme. He says Bombardier\u2019s factory is critical to Belfast, supporting 4,000 jobs and around 80 firms in the supply chain. There would be devastating consequences for the economy if the factory were closed, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. Donaldson adds that Bombardier have a strong case, and accuses Boeing of acting unreasonably by bringing its case against its Canadian rival. The C-series is an innovative aircraft, it\u2019s hugely competitive, and that\u2019s why Boeing in the most unreasonable and irrational way have tried to block Bombardier from the market. Haley Dunne, director of public affairs at Bombardier Belfast, says the 219% tariff is \u201cabsurd\u201d. Speaking on Radio 4 she says that: It\u2019s a preliminary decision, and we\u2019ll continue though the process.... The magnitude of the fines that are being imposed are absolutely absurd. Q: Can you give any guarantees to your workers that jobs are safe? Dunne says that Boeing\u2019s claim is \u201cmeritless\u201d, and Bombardier are confident that the facts will support them in the end. However, there is \u201cno doubt\u201d that the C series jet is crucial to our future, she adds. This 219% tariff slapped on Bombardier could \u201ckill demand for the C-Series in the US\u201d, says the BBC\u2019s Simon Jack on the Today Programme. He points out that last night\u2019s ruling is only \u2018preliminary\u2019. A further ruling in February will examine how much damage has actually been suffered by Boeing (who didn\u2019t actually pitch for this contract to supply jets to Delta). Some critics have claimed that Boeing is just trying to \u201cstrangle a competitor\u201d by bringing its complaint, Jack adds. The UK government has hit back against the US Department of Commerce\u2019s decision to imposing a 219% tariff on sales of Bombardier\u2019s C-Series jet to Delta. Theresa May says she is \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d by the move, and pledged to keep working with Bombardier to protect jobs in Northern Ireland. Unions had urged May to step in to protect Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. She raised concerns about the future of the factory in a recent phone call with President Donald Trump, and also discussed the issue with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau when she visited Canada this month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Thousands of aircraft workers in Northern Ireland have woken up to an uncertain future after the US sided with Boeing in its war against Canada\u2019s Bombardier. Donald Trump\u2019s administration have slapped Bombardier with preliminary tariffs of up to 219% on sales of its C-Series jet to the US airline Delta. This follows allegations from Boeing that Bombardier had unfairly used subsidies from the UK and Canada to sell its regional C-series jets at below cost into the US. The decision could be a huge blow to Northern Ireland\u2019s economy, as Bombardier is the region\u2019s biggest hi-tech employer, with more than 4,000 workers. Our Ireland correspondent, Henry McDonald, explains how the decision will hurt Bombardier, and how Canada has already hit back: If imposed, the duties would more than triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold in the US to about $61m per plane, based on Boeing\u2019s assertion that Delta received the planes for $19m each. Bombardier called the decision \u201cabsurd and divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programs\u201d. Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland reacted angrily to the decision saying it was \u201cclearly aimed at eliminating\u201d Bombardier\u2019s narrow body jets from the US market. We\u2019ll be tracking full reaction to the decision through the day. Also coming up today..... 11am BST: The CBI releases its survey of UK retail sales in September. Volumes are expected to rebound, after shrinking in August. 1.30pm BST: US durable goods figures for August. Economists expect a small rise, after a surprise 6.8% tumble in July. 2pm BST: The IMF publishes the Analytical Chapters of the October 2017 World Economic Outlook. They will examine issues including wage dynamics, how low-income countries cope with weather events, and the impact of fiscal policy across countries. European stock markets are expected to open a little higher.",

Earlier this month Boeing broke ground for its first factory in Europe, in Sheffield.</p> \n   <p>We are pleased to work with our partners, including the British Government, and provide such a vote of confidence in the UK. </p> \n   <p>Any claimed economic threat to Bombardier is due to the weakness of its product in the marketplace, which explains its desperate action that prompted the ITC case due to Bombardier\u2019s decision to violate US trade rules.</p> \n   <p>Boeing welcomes competition and Bombardier can sell its aircraft anywhere in the world. But sales must be made according to globally-accepted trade rules.</p> \n   <p>We believe that global trade only works if everyone abides by the same rules of the road, and that\u2019s a principle that ultimately creates the greatest value for Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our respective aerospace industries.</p> \n   <p>Boeing\u2019s petition to the International Trade Commission seeks to restore a level playing field in the US single-aisle airplane market.

According to the GMB union it supports nearly 10,000 further jobs through its suppliers. </p> \n  <h2>What is the Government doing about it? </h2> \n  <p>Political powersharing at Stormont has been in cold storage for months.

      "bodyText": "EasyJet could be flying planes powered by batteries rather than petroleum to destinations including Paris and Amsterdam within a decade. The UK carrier has formed a partnership with US firm Wright Electric, which is developing a battery-propelled aircraft for flights under two hours. EasyJet said the move would enable battery-powered aircraft to travel short-haul routes such as London to Paris and Amsterdam, and Edinburgh to Bristol. Wright Electric is aiming for an aircraft range of 335 miles, which would cover the journeys of about a fifth of passengers flown by easyJet. Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, said the aerospace industry would follow the lead of the automotive industry in developing electric engines that would cut emissions and noise. \u201cFor the first time in my career I can envisage a future without jet fuel and we are excited to be part of it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is now more a matter of when, not if, a short-haul electric plane will fly.\u201d The airline said it was the next step in making the airline less harmful for the environment, after cutting carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 31% between 2000 and 2016. Wright Electric claims that electric planes will be 50% quieter and 10% cheaper for airlines to buy and operate, with the cost saving potentially passed on to passengers. The US firm said its goal was for every short flight to be electric within 20 years. It has already built a two-seater prototype and is working towards a fully electric plane within a decade. The next step is to scale-up the technology to a 10-seater aircraft, and eventually to build a single aisle, short haul commercial plane, with the capacity to carry at least 120 passengers. Wright Electric was founded in 2016 by a team of aerospace engineers, powertrain experts, and battery chemists, with a background in organisations including Nasa, Boeing, and Cessna. Jeffrey Engler, chief executive and founder of Wright Electric, said the startup firm\u2019s partnership with easyJet was \u201ca powerful validation\u201d of its work. \u201cTheir insights have been invaluable as we look to commercialise our electric aircraft for the large and growing short-haul flight markets,\u201d he added. EasyJet\u2019s chief commercial officer, Peter Duffy, said the partnership would help Wright Electric understand what was required to make the planes commercially successful, looking at factors such as maintenance and revenue management. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing cities and countries starting to talk about banning diesel combustion engines. That would have been unthinkable just a short time ago,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cAs technology moves on, attitudes shift, ambitions change and you see opportunities you didn\u2019t see. This is genuinely exciting.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK warns Boeing it could lose contracts over Bombardier dispute", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has warned aircraft manufacturer Boeing it could lose UK defence contracts over its part in a US decision to slap punitive tariffs of 219% on rival Bombardier, in a dispute that threatens to sour trade relations between London and Washington. Theresa May said she was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d by the move to impose a tariff on sales of Bombardier\u2019s C-Series passenger jet, which threatens at least 1,000 manufacturing jobs in Northern Ireland. Michael Fallon, the UK defence secretary, stepped up the government\u2019s rhetoric, warning that Boeing\u2019s assault on Bombardier \u201ccould jeopardise\u201d its chances of securing government contracts. The business secretary, Greg Clark, joined the chorus of disapproval, branding the ruling \u201cunjustified\u201d and vowing to work with Canada \u2013 where Bombardier is based \u2013 to get it overturned. The backlash follows an interim decision by the US Department of Commerce, which agreed with Boeing\u2019s case that Bombardier received unfair, anti-competitive state support from the Quebec regional government, including a \u00a3740m bailout. Bombardier, which has also received \u00a3113m in repayable funding from the UK government, called the decision \u201cabsurd and divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programmes\u201d. The decision will come as a blow to May, who has made trade relations with the US a key component of the UK\u2019s trade strategy after Brexit. Under pressure from the Democratic Unionist party, May has also personally lobbied the US president, Donald Trump, to persuade Boeing to drop its legal action, in order to protect jobs in Northern Ireland. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, told the country\u2019s parliament on Wednesday that his foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, had raised the issue earlier in the day during trade talks with US trade representative Robert Lighthizer. He said: \u201cWe will continue to stand up for Canadian jobs every step of the way, defend our workers in the aerospace industry in Quebec and right across the country. We know that the punitive actions taken by Boeing are completely unfounded and without merit.\u201d Bombardier employs more than 4,000 people at its plant in east Belfast, about 1,000 of whom build wings and fuselage for 75 C-Series jets being sold to US airline Delta as part of a $5.6bn (\u00a34.2bn) deal struck last year. The US government is preparing to impose a tariff of 219% on each plane sold to Delta. The extra charge would more than triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold in the US to about $61m per plane, based on Boeing\u2019s assertion that Delta received the planes for $19m each. The duty will be imposed only if the DoC\u2019s final verdict, due in February, does not change. Labour\u2019s shadow industrial strategy minister, Chi Onwurah, lashed out at the apparent failure of the prime minister\u2019s lobbying efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s a damning indictment of the criminal negligence and complacency of Theresa May and her government, and a sign of their entire lack of international negotiating skills which bodes really badly for our post-Brexit negotiations,\u201d she said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said: \u201cDo we really believe the US will save us from Brexit with a comprehensive trade deal, when this is how they deal with fair and free international competition?\u201d A UK government spokeswoman said after the decision: \u201cThis is a disappointing interim statement but only the first step in the process. As the prime minister said last week, we will continue to strongly defend UK interests in support of Bombardier at the very highest level because an adverse outcome risks jobs and livelihoods among the 4,200 skilled workers in Belfast. \u201cBoeing\u2019s position in this case is unjustified and frankly not what we would expect of a long-term partner to the UK \u2013 as well as damaging the wider global aerospace industry.\u201d Joe Walters, who is in his 30s and works in material logistics at the Bombardier plant in east Belfast, called on May and the British government to take a harder line with Boeing to end the dispute with Bombardier. \u201cThe Canadian government has already stated that it will not do business with Boeing if it continues to try to break Bombardier. The British government needs to be as hardline as that. It\u2019s simple, forget appealing to Donald Trump \u2013 he\u2019s too busy trying to kill us all with his contest with North Korea.\u201d Geordie Burnside, a shop steward at the Belfast plant, said the size of the tariff had taken everyone by surprise. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting phone calls from early morning asking why the ruling had slapped down such an enormous tariff,\u201d he said. \u201cThey cannot believe the enormity of it or get their heads around it. There have been a lot of tough times at this factory over the last 26 years and we got through. I hope that the company will appeal and the battle isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d In a statement, Boeing said: \u201cWe have heard and understand the concerns from the Prime Minister and the Government about Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. Boeing is committed to the UK and values the partnership, which stretches back almost 80 years.\u201d The company added that it was seeking to restore a \u201clevel playing-field\u201d in the market for short-haul passenger jets and that ultimately all countries benefit if they abide by global trade rules.",

As the prime minister said last week, we will continue to strongly defend UK interests in support of Bombardier at the very highest level because an adverse outcome risks jobs and livelihoods among the 4,200 skilled workers in Belfast.</p> \n<p>\u201cBoeing\u2019s position in this case is unjustified and frankly not what we would expect of a long-term partner to the UK \u2013 as well as damaging the wider global aerospace industry.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joe Walters, who is in his 30s and works in material logistics at the Bombardier plant in east Belfast, called on May and the British government to take a harder line with Boeing to end the dispute with Bombardier.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Canadian government has already stated that it will not do business with Boeing if it continues to try to break Bombardier. The British government needs to be as hardline as that. It\u2019s simple, forget appealing to Donald Trump \u2013 he\u2019s too busy trying to kill us all with his contest with North Korea.\u201d</p> \n<p>Geordie Burnside, a shop steward at the Belfast plant, said the size of the tariff had taken everyone by surprise.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been getting phone calls from early morning asking why the ruling had slapped down such an enormous tariff,\u201d he said. \u201cThey cannot believe the enormity of it or get their heads around it. There have been a lot of tough times at this factory over the last 26 years and we got through. I hope that the company will appeal and the battle isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a statement, Boeing said: \u201cWe have heard and understand the concerns from the Prime Minister and the Government about Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. Boeing is committed to the UK and values the partnership, which stretches back almost 80 years.\u201d</p> \n<p>The company added that it was seeking to restore a \u201clevel playing-field\u201d in the market for short-haul passenger jets and that ultimately all countries benefit if they abide by global trade rules. </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Swedish truckmaker Scania, which is owned by Volkswagen, has been fined \u20ac880m (\u00a3770m) by EU antitrust regulators for price fixing. The European commission said Scania had broken antitrust rules by colluding for 14 years with five other European truck manufacturers on pricing. The manufacturers have been fined \u20ac3.8bn in total \u2013 a record penalty imposed by the commission for a vehicle cartel. The other five members of the cartel \u2013 Daimler, DAF, MAN, Iveco and Volvo/Renault \u2013 settled with the commission a year ago but Scania refused to cooperate, the commission said. Scania maintains its innocence and says it fully cooperated with the commission and was likely to appeal. A Scania spokeswoman said: \u201cWe just received the information and it will take some time to go through the material. If no new information has emerged in the investigation we are planning to prepare an appeal against the decision.\u201d She added: \u201cScania has not on any level or in any context entered into an agreement with other manufacturers with regards to pricing. Scania has also not delayed the introduction of new engines that meet EU legislation on exhaust emissions.\u201d MAN, also owned by VW, alerted the commission to the cartel and escaped a \u20ac1.2bn fine. The other four received reduced fines for settling. The biggest penalty, of \u20ac1bn, was imposed on Germany\u2019s Daimler. Dutch company DAF was fined \u20ac753m, Volvo/Renault \u20ac670m and Italy\u2019s Iveco \u20ac495m. Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision marks the end of our investigation into a very long-lasting cartel \u2013 14 years. \u201cThis cartel affected very substantial numbers of road hauliers in Europe, since Scania and the other truck manufacturers in the cartel produce more than nine out of every 10 medium and heavy trucks sold in Europe. Instead of colluding on pricing, the truck manufacturers should have been competing against each other \u2013 also on environmental improvements.\u201d Vestager said Scania would have received a 10% lower fine if it had reached a settlement with the commission. She said road haulage was an essential part of the European transport sector, and its competitiveness depended on truck prices. The collusion began at a meeting at a hotel in Brussels in January 1997, according to the commission, and came to an end in 2011 when it carried out surprise inspections of the firms. Senior managers colluded at meetings on the fringes of trade fairs and other events, and also discussed price fixing by phone. From 2004, the cartel was run by lower- level managers through the companies\u2019 German subsidiaries and information was exchanged by email. The truck makers coordinated \u201cgross list\u201d prices and also colluded on passing on to customers the costs of new technologies to meet stricter emission rules. The commission said its investigation did not reveal any links between this cartel and the use of defeat devices to cheat emissions tests. Vestager said the commission had investigated nine car cartels and fined manufacturers more than \u20ac6bn in total, with more investigations ongoing.",
