    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Chancellor George Osborne claimed on Friday that 200,000 new homes could be created by 2020 by accelerating development of disused industrial sites. In the increasingly contested ground of housing policy, Osborne is proposing to order local councils to pre-approve planning permissions on 90% of suitable brownfield land by 2020. This will allow developers to start building sooner than otherwise, the Treasury argues. The government will set aside an initial \u00a35m fund to help local authorities create the first 100 sites with so-called local development orders and this fund could grow to \u00a3500m. The government wouldalso consult on a range of measures to enforce this approach, including allowing developers to apply directly to central government where councils have not done enough to remove planning obstacles on brownfield sites. Osborne said: \"This urban planning revolution will mean that in effect development on these sites will be pre-approved \u2013 local authorities will be able to specify the type of housing, not whether there is housing. And it will mean planning permission for up to 200,000 new homes \u2013 while at the same time protecting our green spaces.\" Details of the new regime in London, first outlined in Osborne's Mansion House speech, were set out with the mayor of London, Boris Johnson. The two men proposed the building 50,000 new homes across 20 new housing zones in the capital. In total, the Treasury and the Greater London Authority will provide \u00a3400m to help prepare brownfield land for development, and councils will be tasked with identifying and packaging together that land into housing zones. The mayor will also have the power to call in developments of 100 or more homes where there are delays. Currently this is only possible on sites of over 150 homes. Five sites have already been identified, including Tottenham Hale in Haringey, Southall in Ealing and South Poplar in Tower Hamlets. Johnson first set out some of the plans in his March housing strategy. The housing zones, similar to enterprise zones, will have lighter-touch planning and effective land assembly, including, where necessary, the use of compulsory purchase powers. There will be \u00a3200m of additional government funding available for 10 zones outside London with bids due to start at the end of this year. Communities secretary Eric Pickles said: \"We're determined to make the very best use of derelict land and former industrial sites to provide the homes this country desperately needs in a way that protects our valued countryside. By ensuring commitments to housing development are in place early and having dedicated housing zones, building becomes quicker and easier for homebuilders, businesses and councils.\" The Treasury said the government will also look at how more housing can be built on existing estates. Research shows London's inner boroughs will contain 1.7 million fewer people than they did in 1911 \u2013 despite record numbers of people expected to be living in the capital by 2021. The mayor is suggesting developers can bid for a share of a \u00a3150m loan fund to invest in kickstarting and accelerating the radical regeneration of some of the country's most deprived social housing estates. Johnson said: \"Many of our estates date back to the 1960s and it is high time that they received a new lease of life. I urge developers to apply for the funding and get building.\"",

      "bodyText": "It is a sweltering day in the west London neighbourhood of Hammersmith, but for one estate agent the temperature of the housing market has been distinctly colder in recent weeks. News this week that the government will give the Bank of England extra powers to deflate a housing bubble, allied to hints of an earlier than expected rise in interest rates from the Bank governor, will only make people more cautious. \"We noticed a cool breeze coming in about eight weeks ago,\" says Teresa Brewer, a partner at long-established Hammersmith estate agent Finlay Brewer. The local \u00a32m-plus market, centred on desirable areas such as Brook Green, seems to be \"quietening down\u2013 people were less willing to pay the guide prices\". \"We could see that people were being more cautious and slower to offer,\" chips in Paul Cosgrove, a director at the firm. \"So there is a natural correction already \u2013 there doesn't need to be any action in our opinion,\" says Brewer. The pair are explaining why they do not think the new powers being given to the Bank, or a surprise interest rate rise, were necessary or desirable. It is the rapid pace of house price growth in the capital that has raised concerns about a property bubble and led to the moves by the Treasury to limit the amount people can borrow. Annual price growth in the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is running at 16.4%, with an average price of \u00a3708,000, compared with \u00a3172,000 for the UK overall, according to the Land Registry, while Nationwide's most recent analysis put the figure at 21%. According to Mark Coden, partner at nearby estate agent Barnard Marcus, some pockets saw prices rise by up to 15% in the first three months of this year alone. The Finlay Brewer pair say that at the \u00a32m-plus end of the market, buyers were already contending with ongoing talk about a mansion tax, 7% stamp duty, general election uncertainty and the knowledge, even before Bank governor Mark Carney's latest comments, that interest rates were probably going to rise within months. On top of that, there are strict rules on mortgage affordability that came into force in April, which have had a big impact, and what the industry regards as unhelpful headlines about an \"overheating\" market. \"With all that, you've got your natural correction happening anyway,\" says Brewer. Down the road at a well-known estate agent, not far from Brook Green, an anonymous staff member backs up this diagnosis of the local market's temperature. Eighteen months ago, a one-bedroom property would have gone for up to \u00a3450,000. A year later the same type of flat might have gone for up to \u00a3600,000, but that is changing. He says: \"Literally in the last two or three months the pedal has just come off, and we've been seeing things slow down a little bit. Prices are still going up but we're not getting as many instances of 'best and final offers' and sealed bids. It has definitely cooled a little. Buyers are becoming a bit more sensible.\" He reckons an interest rate rise would probably have minimal impact. Many buyers earn \"considerable amounts of money\" in the City. As to the moves to cap home loans, \"that will probably affect first-time buyers a lot more\".Over at Barnard Marcus, Coden said he hadn't really noticed any slowdown. As of lunchtime on Friday, his office had 110 viewings booked in on 10 properties, with perhaps another 20 or more viewings likely to be booked in before close of play. \"I think west London will stay strong,\" he said.",

In fact, S&amp;P\u2019s growth forecast could even be slightly on the conservative side as they see GDP growth coming in at 3.0% in 2014 and 2.5% in 2015. We currently expect GDP growth to come in at 3.1% in 2014 and 2.7% in 2015, and there is an increased prospect that growth in 2014 could come in even higher following the news that expansion in the first quarter is likely to be revised up from 0.8% quarter-on-quarter to 0.9% quarter-on-quarter due to an upgrading of construction growth. S&amp;P express optimism that UK productivity growth will pick up</p> <p><b>The Chancellor will see S&amp;P removing the threat of downgrading its AAA rating on the UK as further vindication of his economic policy. </b>This follows on from the IMF praising the UK\u2019s recovery earlier this month and adjusting its stance to consider that the Chancellor\u2019s deficit reduction plans are appropriate.

The message was caveated, but Carney would have been well aware of the probable impact of his words. He would not have chosen the words lightly, which makes them significant. As of yesterday, markets were pricing in a hike around Q2 2015, but two-year swap rates have since risen more than 15bps. We expect the first hike in November 2014. The change in tone was sensible, in our view. Record low interest rates are increasingly unnecessary.</p> <p>Mark Carney seems much more pragmatic than the dogmatic dove he is often caricatured as. That is an important takeaway for how monetary policy will be conducted. As the economy has recovered, his tone has changed. Less than one year ago Mark Carney said he did not expect to have to hike interest rates until late-2016 or perhaps 2017. Now he is saying they may go up in 2014. </p> <p>His speech last night is in marked contrast to the message he gave at the Inflation Report press conference in the middle of last month, which pushed market expectations of a rate hike back a few months.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wood adds that the UK no longer needs record low interest rates of just 0.5%, as the economy is \"flying now\". </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employment is rising at a record pace and we see no sign of economic growth slowing from its current approaching 4% annualised pace. Wage growth remains weak, which could still delay the first hike. But weak wage inflation will not last for long if growth remains this strong. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KatieAllenGdn/statuses/477359087748120576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Pound soaring on UK rate rise prospects.

      "bodyText": "I mentioned earlier today that L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor, European Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs, had given an eye-catching speech in Berlin (where else?!) calling for fiscal transfers across the eurozone. And tonight, the Telegraph's Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has weighed in: The European Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs is very close to outright revolt, not surprisingly since his job is to deal with terrible consequences of these policies. At least someone is speaking for the moderate Left in this Europe of Omerta, where the code of silence stifles criticism from those whose political values are most injured. His proposal \u2013 for starters \u2013 is a pan-EMU unemployment scheme to act as a fiscal stabiliser and share the burden of asymmetric shocks. European Commission endorses Telegraph view of the euro (cheeky headline alert!) Here's Katie Allen's news story about today's developments, from S&amp;P's upgrade to the pound surging as interest rate rises loom: Bank of England looks set to call time on era of record-low interest rates More rating action -- Fitch has reaffirmed France's credit rating at AA+ with a stable outlook.... And DBRS, one of the smaller rating agencies, has left Austria's top-notch rating intact. It's a busy evening for rating decisions, with S&amp;P cutting South Africa and Bulgaria's ratings by one notch, to BBB+ and BBB- respectively. IHS Global Insight's Howard Archer - never slow with a reaction - agrees that George Osborne will be feeling vindicated tonight by S&amp;P's announcement. He writes: A real boost for Chancellor George Osborne and the government as Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s upgraded the outlook on the UK\u2019s AAA credit rating from negative to stable. This is particularly welcome news for the Chancellor as Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s is the only major credit rating agency that has retained a prized AAA rating for the UK. The restoration of a Stable outlook to the UK\u2019s AAA rating means that S&amp;P now attach a less than a one-in-three probability of a downgrade within the next two years. Furthermore, the general tone of S&amp;P\u2019s comments will be music to the Chancellor\u2019s ears, as it considers that the UK\u2019s recovery is robust and broadening while fiscal consolidation is continuing. In fact, S&amp;P\u2019s growth forecast could even be slightly on the conservative side as they see GDP growth coming in at 3.0% in 2014 and 2.5% in 2015. We currently expect GDP growth to come in at 3.1% in 2014 and 2.7% in 2015, and there is an increased prospect that growth in 2014 could come in even higher following the news that expansion in the first quarter is likely to be revised up from 0.8% quarter-on-quarter to 0.9% quarter-on-quarter due to an upgrading of construction growth. S&amp;P express optimism that UK productivity growth will pick up The Chancellor will see S&amp;P removing the threat of downgrading its AAA rating on the UK as further vindication of his economic policy. This follows on from the IMF praising the UK\u2019s recovery earlier this month and adjusting its stance to consider that the Chancellor\u2019s deficit reduction plans are appropriate. Last year, the IMF had called for slower spending cuts to help the UK recovery strengthen. S&amp;P's upgrade of Britain's AAA credit rating outlook to stable is a pre-weekend present for the government, reckons Sky's Ed Conway. Britain's credit rating has been restored to AAA: Stable by Standard &amp; Poor's tonight; meaning the UK once again holds a gleaming, top-notch credit rating with one of the Big Three rating agencies. S&amp;P, which unlike Fitch and Moody's did not downgrade the UK during the crisis, removed the \"negative\" rating tonight. It made the move after seeing that: \"amid further progress in consolidating public finances, the UK's economic recovery is broadening\". S&amp;P said that it realised that next May's general election could lead to a change in fiscal plan, but still believes the Britain could achieve a budget surplus within five years: Our base-case assumption is that the next government will not abandon the goal of arriving at a position where the U.K. could start to pay down the stock of debt in absolute terms during the fiscal year ending April 2019. S&amp;P also predicted that the UK would expand by nearly 3% this year, and another 2.5% in 2015. Reaction to follow.... The ongoing insurgency in Iraq, and the prospect of UK interest rates being raised before Christmas, has driven European stock markets down across the board today. The pound has surged close to a five-year high against the US dollar after Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned last night that the first rate rise could come sooner than markets expect. Economists are predicting that the BoE will hike before Christmas, with Berenberg bank pencilling in November's MPC meeting. Its chief economist, Rob Wood, said: We expect the first hike in November 2014. The change in tone was sensible, in our view. Record low interest rates are increasingly unnecessary. Business groups have urged the Bank to be cautious, as bookmakers cut the odds of a rate rise in 2014. John Cridland, CBI Director-General, says: \u201cWith the economic recovery firming up nicely, any change in monetary policy should ensure this isn\u2019t blown off course. The Bank has clearly stated in its forward guidance that when rates do begin to rise they will do so gradually and to a level materially below their pre-crisis average.\" And there are warnings that over-stretched households will struggle to cope when mortgage repayment rates rise. The pound jumped 1.5 cents to $1.696 since last night, and is holding an 18-month high of \u20ac1.253 against the euro. Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says Mark Carney's speech was his most hawkish since taking office, and may reflect disagreements among the monetary policy committee about rate rises: Carney\u2019s comments are likely the precursor of the first official vote for higher interest rates and all eyes will be on the voting ratio in next week\u2019s minutes. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 63 points, or 1%, to 6,779 points. The selloff has been led by building firms and retailers, as traders anticipate that interest rate rises will hit demand for housing and eat into disposable income. Shares in two of Britain's largest builders, Persimmon and Barratt, tumbled by over 6%. High street stalwarts Next and Marks &amp; Spencer have both shed 3.5%. The oil price hit nine-month highs, on ongoing fears of supply disruption from Iraqi oil fields. A barrel of Brent crude is trading around $113, a level since last September, having touched $114 earlier. Traders have been watching events in Iraq closely -- with US secretary of state John Kerry saying that President Obama must take \"timely decisions\" in response to the gains made by the Isis group this week. ETX Capital says there is concern in the oil market, rather than panic: Prospects of a civil war in Iraq \u2013 OPEC\u2019s second-largest exporter \u2013 will keep oil prices uncomfortably high, although for the moment these tensions have been confined to the north of the country. The Resolution Foundation is worried that many UK families are already struggling to meet mortgage payments; a rate rise will hurt them badly. Their Matthew Whittaker, chief economist, says: \u201cThe scale of mortgage debt in this country is still substantial, even after years of economic downturn, and it could start to look precarious for many households over the coming years. There\u2019s no sign yet of a surge in wages which could help to deal with higher mortgage repayments \u2013 so there\u2019s every reason to be very cautious on interest rates. Even a modest rise could have profound implications for the number of households exposed to difficult repayment levels. \u201d Over in America, General Motors has announced yet another car recall, reports CNBC: This will interest eurozone-crisis watchers. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, has given a lecture in Berlin today arguing for Eurozone members to share some of the costs of short-term unemployment insurance in the region. Such a policy, he claims, would underpin confidence in the euro and allow countries to help each other recover from cyclical economic problems. It would also breach the current ban on 'fiscal transfers' - where one country funds the budget of another. But Andor argues that the eurozone must break its rejection of fiscal transfers -- citing the example of Germany after reunification, where the West helped the East to grow. He says: The EU cannot live together for too long with the risk of monetary breakdown, which also would bring with itself social and political breakdown. If our Economic and Monetary Union is meant to be irreversible, it must also be fair and it must be based on solidarity. We must pay attention to the employment and social outcomes, and try to prevent lasting divergence. For that, an automatic fiscal stabiliser is needed at the euro zone level. Either we give up the dogma of \u2018no fiscal transfers\u2019 in the EMU, or we give up the European Social Model and everything the Europe 2020 Strategy ever stood for. More here: UK households have been warned to get ready for the first rise in borrowing costs since mid-2007. And if you're looking for a new mortgage, the search could get trickier. David Hollingworth at mortgage broker London &amp; Country, explains: \"Fixed rate mortgages have been drifting up over the course of the year but this could be a trigger for some more increases. \"The Bank is at pains to say that when rates do start to move it will be gradual, so we should see a continuation of the drift upwards, but there might be an initial rush of deals disappearing.\" More here: Households braced for first rise in borrowing costs in more than five years Takeover news -- OpenTable, the website which lets people book restaurant tables at a discount, has been snapped up by Priceline, the airline and hotels reservation service. Boris Johnson's economics advisor, Dr Gerard Lyons, suggests that the Bank of England should ease the UK into a world of higher rates, with an \"eighth-point\" hike: Online bookmaker Paddy Power has slashed its odds on a UK interest rate rise this year. It is now offering 5/4* on the first borrowing hike coming between July and December, down from 3/1 yesterday (before the City's top brass glammed up for the Mansion House). It is still offering 7/4 on a rate rise in January-June 2014, or 3/1 that the Bank of England holds off until the second half of the year. * - if you didn't enjoy a misspent youth, that means you win \u00a35 for every \u00a34 you bet, plus the \u00a34 stake back Banks across the European Union have been put on notice that the regulators are preparing new guidelines to ensure they do not breach the cap on bonuses which was implemented this year. Several banks, including Lloyds and Barclays, handed top staff 'allowances' on top of their fixed pay and bonuses this year; allowing them to evade the cap. As my colleague Jill Treanor reports, the EBA is now investigating this practice: The European Banking Authority, publishing its first analysis of pay practices across Europe, said that it was looking at the new \"allowances\" being handed to top bankers as a result of the cap which restricts bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve. \"In general these allowances which are paid as fixed amounts in addition to the base salary as considered by institutions as fixed remuneration. However these allowances are discretionary as they are paid to selected members of staff and in most cases only for limited periods of time. Under exceptional periods they can also be cancelled,\" the EBA said. \"The EBA is currently analysing this emerging practice and will set guidance criteria to correctly assign these elements to either variable or fixed remuneration so as to ensure that these practices do not lead to a circumvention of the newly introduced cap between the variable and fixed component of remuneration,\" the pan European banking regulator said. The EBA has conducted its own analysis of data published by bankers about pay for \"high earners\" - those staff earning \u20ac1m or more - in 2012. It found there has been a shift to variable to fixed pay and indicates that is expects more bankers to fall under the scope of its pay codes. It says: Currently bankers deemed to be taking or managing risks are covered by its codes, as just 1.2% of staff are covered. The average ratio between variable and fixed pay reduced from 205% in 2010 to 108% in 2012. FastFT flags up that the EBA report also shows that the UK has more than 10 times as many bankers making more than \u20ac1,000,000 per year than any other European country. (note that this is a logarithmic scale!) London remains the region's \"financial centre of gravity\", they point out: Shares in UK retailers are being hit hard today by the prospect of an interest rate hike before Christmas. A rise in borrowing costs could easily hit high street spending in the crucial spending period, as households deal with higher mortgage payments. Sports Direct shares have fallen by 4%, with Next following close behind. Until last night, retailers had been looking forward to a World Cup bounce -- Mark Carney's speech has raised new fears.... Bruce Dear, head of London real estate at law firm Eversheds, urges Mark Carney to take a nurturing approach to the UK economy when the time comes to raise borrowing costs. \u201cSince 2008 the UK economy has been supported by a zimmer frame of 300-year low interest rates. With recovery underway, the trick is to raise rates in small and well spaced quarter point steps. Pull the cheap money crutch away too suddenly and the economy may not be strong enough to walk alone. For Mr Carney, this appears to be more a case of nursing rather than ice hockey.\u201d Our Canadian-born bank governor is quite the ice hockey fan, of course -- so perhaps he didn't mind missing last night's World Cup game. The number of people in work across Europe continued to creep up in the first quarter of this year, despite falling in five countries. New data from Eurostat shows that the number of employed people increased by 0.1% in the euro area in January-March, compared to October-December, and by 0.2% in the wider European Union. But employment totals didn't rise everywhere, as Eurostat reports: Among Member States for which data are available, Hungary (+1.5%), Latvia (+0.8%), the United Kingdom (+0.6%), the Czech Republic and Poland (both +0.5%) recorded the highest increases in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the previous quarter. Cyprus (-1.2%), Portugal (-0.3%), Lithuania and Finland (both -0.2%) and Italy (-0.1%) recorded the only decreases. In Greece, the total number of people in work rose by 0.2%, Eurostat added, having slid by 0.7% in the last three months of 2013. Britain's economy may have grown even more strongly than we thought in the first three months of this year. The Office for National Statistics has revised its assessment of the UK construction sector, based on new information from builders. It now reckons that the sector grew by 1.5% in the January-March quarter, a big jump on the 0.6% previously estimated. That may mean the overall economy grew by 0.9% in the quarter, not the 0.8% previously estimated. The ONS also reported that total construction output was 4.6% larger in April than the previous year, as the building sector recovered. However, the amount of new orders flowing into the sector did drop, compared to the end of last year: There were falls in orders for public new housing (-45.7%), infrastructure (-16.5%), private industrial (-14.6%) and private commercial work (-1.9%). Public other new work and private housing new orders both increased by 6.8% and 2.8% respectively. A possible reason for the fall in public housing new orders is that investment in housing associations is coming from private investment rather than a public source. S&amp;P is also due to publish its latest assessment of the UK's credit-worthiness today; that report probably won't come until late this afternoon. The recent recovery in the UK economy wasn't enough to persuade Fitch to upgrade Britain's credit rating. Early this morning, Fitch announced that it had decided to leave the UK on AA+ rating, the second highest notch, with a stable outlook. Fitch did note that the UK has improved since December, saying: \"favourable macroeconomic trends, including strong GDP growth, falling unemployment and inflation close to the 2.0 percent target, have continued in the UK economy\" It reckons the UK will grow at a healthy 3% this year, and 2.5% in 2015. So why no upgrade? Because the UK is still running \"too large\" a deficit to merit a triple-A rating. Fitch expects gross general government debt (GGGD), using the EU Treaty definition, to peak at 92%-93% of GDP in 2015-16 and to start falling in 2017, when the primary balance turns positive. Debt remains among the highest of 'AA' and 'AAA' rated sovereigns. And Fitch also cited the housing boom as a potential risk: At the same time, recent rapid increase in the house price-to-income ratio, in particular in London, could lead to excessive leverage if supported by unsustainable lending practices. If unchecked over the longer term, this would increase macroeconomic risks and could also have a knock-on impact on the sovereign's fiscal position. Berenberg bank now reckons that the first UK interest rate rise will come in November. That's around five months earlier than markets had been predicting before last night's Mansion House speech. Its chief economist, Robert Wood, says that Carney's comments mark \"a significant change in tone on interest rates and the housing market\". Wood tells clients: Carney said an interest rate hike: \u201ccould happen sooner than markets currently expect\u201d. The message was caveated, but Carney would have been well aware of the probable impact of his words. He would not have chosen the words lightly, which makes them significant. As of yesterday, markets were pricing in a hike around Q2 2015, but two-year swap rates have since risen more than 15bps. We expect the first hike in November 2014. The change in tone was sensible, in our view. Record low interest rates are increasingly unnecessary. Mark Carney seems much more pragmatic than the dogmatic dove he is often caricatured as. That is an important takeaway for how monetary policy will be conducted. As the economy has recovered, his tone has changed. Less than one year ago Mark Carney said he did not expect to have to hike interest rates until late-2016 or perhaps 2017. Now he is saying they may go up in 2014. His speech last night is in marked contrast to the message he gave at the Inflation Report press conference in the middle of last month, which pushed market expectations of a rate hike back a few months. Wood adds that the UK no longer needs record low interest rates of just 0.5%, as the economy is \"flying now\". Employment is rising at a record pace and we see no sign of economic growth slowing from its current approaching 4% annualised pace. Wage growth remains weak, which could still delay the first hike. But weak wage inflation will not last for long if growth remains this strong. Brent crude has now hit $114 per barrel, a new nine-month high, amid fears that the crisis in Iraq will hit supplies (see 7.45am onwards). Press Association has more details: Analysts at Barclays said: \"The stakes are high for the oil market. With Libyan production looking set to be offline for a significant period, and the return of Iran's sanctions-restricted barrels likely to be slow, Iraqi oil is an important swing factor.\" They pointed to disruption to a key pipeline linking Kirkuk in Iraq to Ceyhan in Turkey, which has been repeatedly bombed by insurgents. \"The security situation is thwarting repair efforts. With no immediate end in sight to the violence in the north, we do not expect that pipeline to be operational on a sustained basis any time soon,\" the analysts said. Shares in UK housebuilders and property developers are falling in early trading, following chancellor George Osborne's decision to hand the Bank of England new powers to control the housing market. While Carney was laying the ground for a rate hike, the chancellor was telling the black-tied throng at the Mansion House that the BoE can impose caps on how large a mortgage people can get, relative to income and property value. Here's last night's story: Bank of England gets new powers to curb mortgages to prevent asset bubble Barratt Development are down 3%, Land Securities fell 2.5%, British Land shed 2.4% and Persimmon lost 2.1%. Reuters is reporting that investors now predict that the first UK interest rate hike is likely to come before Christmas, rather than next spring: STERLING OVERNIGHT INTERBANK AVERAGE CURVE PRICING IN CHANCE OF UK RATE HIKE IN 5 MONTHS, VS 8 MONTHS ON THURSDAY It's the Mark Carney effect: the pound has hit a one-month high against the US dollar, and an 18-month high against the euro, Last night's Mansion House speech, in which the governor set the stage for interest rate rises to start before next May's election, sent traders rushing to buy the pound (unless they were watching the opening game of the World Cup, of course). The pound hit $1.6987 against the US dollar this morning. And sterling also surged to a new 18-month high of \u20ac1.252 against the euro; one euro is now worth 79.9p. Stan Shamu of IG explains: Sterling got a kicker from comments by BoE Governor Mark Carney, suggesting rates could be lifted from a record low level sooner than the market expects. Mr Carney has been one of the more dovish members within the central banks ranks, so when traders see comments like \u2018the start of BoE rate increases is getting nearer\u2019 and an \u2018acute need for vigilance on housing market\u2019 they react. This chart shows how Brent crude has climbed steadily since the Iraq insurgency began, to hit its highest level since last September this morning ($113.75 per barrel). US crude oil has also hit a nine-month high, as traders watch events in the Middle East: Ken Hasegawa, a Tokyo-based commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan, sums up the mood: \"There have been no disruptions to oil supplies so far but people are very nervous.\" Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. The Iraq insurgency continues to loom over the markets today, pushing up the oil price and weighing on shares. Overnight the price of Brent crude has climbed to a new nine-month high, touching $113.75, as the crisis raises fears that US military could be sent back into Iraq. And European stock markets are likely to fall again today, with economists concerned about the impact which a spike in energy costs will have on the world economy. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets points out: The prospect of further [oil price] rises appears quite likely as the Iraqi government tries to stem the losses of territory to the insurgents. Given the fragile state of the global economic recovery sharply rising oil prices is the last thing the global economy needs... Equity market calls FTSE 100 is expected to open 27 points lower at 6,816 German DAX is expected to open 22 points lower at 9,916 French CAC40 is expected to open 9 points lower at 4,545 And in the currency markets, the pound has jumped against the dollar after governor Mark Carney's Mansion House speech, in which he warned that interest rate rises could come sooner than the markets expect. Sterling has gained 1.5 cents against the US dollar since 9pm last night, to $1.695, and could well move higher.... I'll be tracking all the action through the day as usual.",

      "bodyText": "The Isle of Man-based Scheinberg family behind the world's two biggest online poker sites \u2013 PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker \u2013 are to sell the controversial business they founded 14 years ago for $4.9bn (\u00a32.9bn) in a deal backed by private equity group Blackstone. The sale is designed to draw a line under the group's contentious past in America which has left past senior executives, including Isai Scheinberg, charged in the US with bank fraud, money laundering and illegal gambling offences. The two poker sites were run by competing firms until both had their respective operations in the US shut down in 2011, and a criminal indictment was filed against top executives. Full Tilt, then based in Alderney in the Channel Islands, was quickly found to have a black hole in its books and was only saved from imploding when it was bought by PokerStars after the latter reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice and pledged not to return to unlicensed online poker in America. PokerStars agreed to forfeit $547m (\u00a3322m) to the US authorities as part of the deal, which did not include an admission of wrong-doing. The settlement also required PokerStars to bar Isai Scheinberg from any management influence at the company. The combined group last year made most of its $1.1bn revenues from European markets, among the largest of which is the UK. Poker player Victoria Coren Mitchell, who in April became the only player to win PokerStar's European poker tour twice, is affiliated to the company as a \"Team PokerStars Pro\". The group is now keen to return to its many American players as US states have begun to legalise online poker one by one. So far only Nevada and New Jersey have active licences and PokerStars has so far been unsuccessful in licence applications, in part because of its past in the US. Cutting ties with the Scheinbergs is seen as the key to winning support from US state regulators. The business is being bought by Amaya Gaming, a relatively small casino and lottery software group listed on the Canadian stock exchange. It is taking on huge borrowings to fund the deal from Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Macquarie and others. Amaya has agreed to transfer its listing to a larger market within 15 months of its acquisition of PokerStars. That could see it join the London stock market alongside competitor Bwin. Party, which owns the PartyPoker brand \u2013 another name that once dominated the prize US online poker market, but exited after George Bush introduced anti-online-gambling laws in 2006. PokerStars already has about 400 staff in the West End of London. Sources close to the Scheinberg family privately said Isai and his son Mark, who is chief executive, live in the Isle of Man and have done for some time. While a banking source said Mark is understood to travel regularly to the US, his father, who is among those indicted, does not. Both sources declined to be named. The Department of Justice describe Isai Scheinberg as being \"at large\". A criminal indictment, unsealed in 2011, describes him as being \"founder, owner, and principal decision-maker for PokerStars\". In the official sale press release Amaya stress that PokerStar's current Isle of Man operating group was founded and run by Mark Scheinberg, not his father. Mark Scheinberg said: \"I am incredibly proud of the business Isai and I have built over the last 14 years.\"",

      "bodyText": "Will caps on loan-to-income ratios work? Mark Carney is like one of these World Cup referees with a can of magic vanishing spray. Whenever the governor of the Bank of England draws a line on the pitch, the mark quickly disappears. On arrival in the job just less than a year ago, Carney's forward guidance indicated that interest rates wouldn't go up until at least 2016. That idea was quickly abandoned as the economy took off and unemployment started to fall rapidly. As recently as last month, Carney was still playing down expectations of a rate rise this year by saying the economy had \"only just begun to head back towards normal\". Now the first rate hike \"could happen sooner than markets currently expect\". The revised betting in markets after Thursday's Mansion House speech is November. There is nothing wrong with being flexible, of course. It would be odd if the governor and colleagues were not. But the rapid evolution of thinking indicates the tricky nature of the coming decisions for the Bank's rate-setting monetary policy committee. Inflation is low \u2013 just 1.8% on the latest reading \u2013 but there are obvious dangers in maintaining Bank rate at emergency levels when the economy is expanding at 4% or so and the housing market has taken off, thereby creating risks to stability if borrowers over-extend themselves. House prices have risen by 10% over the past year, approaching early-2007 levels, and the excitement is no longer confined to London and the south-east. As Carney noted, \"expectations that prices will continue to rise are now most marked outside London\". The governor's aim, roughly speaking, is to keep rises in interest rates \"gradual and limited\" and use specific measures to guard against excessive indebtedness. The latter are the so-called macroprudential tools, such as caps on loan-to-income ratios and demands to lenders to hold more capital against mortgages. Nice plan, but do macroprudential tools actually work? Carney conceded they are \"relatively novel\" in the UK, even if they have proved effective in other countries. Not everybody is convinced by the evidence from elsewhere. Fidelity's Trevor Greetham argues that Canada has been using loan-to-value caps since the second world war and \"the jury is still out as to their impact\". On the UK today, Greetham says: \"I don't think macroprudential measures will slow the housing boom effectively, and they could actually raise financial risks if they delay a warranted rise in base rates.\" Carney might counter that he's anticipated that threat. After all, he also said at the Mansion House that \"macroprudential policy is not a substitute for monetary policy\". Fair enough. But the interplay between interest rates and loan caps is going to be hard for policy-makers to gauge. Vanishing lines could be followed by blurred lines. A word in favour of cabbies General opinion seems to regard London's black-cab drivers as a bunch of Luddites unworthy of protection on account of their arrogance, lack of road manners and shunning of journeys they don't fancy. They're not all like that by any means, but the caricature was reinforced when the cabbies blocked roads in central London on Wednesday to protest about Uber's smartphone app. They deserve their comeuppance, many argued. Really? On the issue at the heart the protest \u2013 does the Uber app represent fair competition? \u2013 the taxi drivers surely have a strong case. The current licencing regime requires black-cab drivers to ride around for a couple of years on mopeds to acquire \"the knowledge\" of London's roads. In the age of sat-nav, that requirement is probably overdoing things. But those are the rules and, in return, taxis are supposed to enjoy several privileges, such as a regulated meter, which private hire firms do not enjoy. They also have obligations: drivers must use high-specification vehicles that cost \u00a335,000 and upwards and attract a heavy road tax. The Uber app would appear to bypass the meter regulations altogether. A smartphone is used to calculate fares according to time and distance. That's a meter by any commonsense definition, even if it fits in a pocket. It's now up to the high court to judge the legality of Uber's app, which is the correct way to settle the dispute. But you can't blame the cabbies for insisting their rights are enforced, if that's how the court rules. Nobody, after all, is suggesting that their obligations should also be ripped up and that they be allowed to drive Toyota Priuses, or whatever, to compete with Uber on price. High-quality, safe taxis offering regulated fares have been seen as a social good for decades, whatever the short-comings of some drivers. Transport for London, which approved the Uber app, seems dazzled by the notion that all disruptive technology benefits consumers. Usually it does. But sometimes it produces a dispiriting race to the bottom. TSB not so challenging Half the banking world styles itself a \"challenger\" bank these days. Ridiculously, Lloyds, the UK's biggest domestic banking group, even applies the term to its 100%-owned Halifax operation. If that's the benchmark, TSB, taking the first steps towards separation from Lloyds next week via flotation, definitely has rights on the label. Sure enough, TSB chief executive Paul Pester has been using it liberally. To give TSB credit, it is full of ideas on how to be different. An interest rate of 5% on current accounts is market-leading. And, as mentioned here last week, the new pay arrangements at TSB are novel. Pester will be paid less than peers, and bonuses for all staff will be calculated as a percentage of salary with the aim of rewarding good customer service rather than flogging financial products. But being different is not quite the same as being a forceful challenger. There is no neat definition of a challenger bank , but Sir John Vickers's Independent Commission on Banking had a stab in 2011. It recommended that the entity being split from Lloyds should have a share of the current account market of \"at least 6%\". TSB will start with 4.2%. Good luck to TSB, but, purely from a competition perspective, its rebirth as an independent bank is pretty timid. Severn Trent's valuation Severn Trent's shares briefly touched \u00a320 this week, before closing yesterday at \u00a319.77. So what? Well, it's the first time the share price has started with a 2 since the company rejected a \u00a322-a-share offer last summer from LongRiver, a consortium led by a Canadian pension fund. Severn Trent's board was booed by most of the City for rejecting \u00a322, or \u00a35.3bn, as inadequate. Such a valuation wouldn't be seen again for years and years, ran the consensus view, and the shares slumped almost to \u00a316. \"Severn Trent's management should have jumped at the offer,\" said one analyst at the time. There is clearly still a little ground left to reach \u00a322, but the same offer today would be laughed out of court. Long-termish, eh? It'll never catch on.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Financial markets have raced to price in a UK interest rate rise by the end of the year following the clearest indication yet from the Bank of England that it is close to calling time on the era of record low borrowing costs. Households and business owners were warned to prepare for rates to rise as soon as November from 0.5%, where they have been for more than five years. Comments by Bank governor Mark Carney on Thursday that rates could increase sooner than markets thought prompted financial players to bring forward their bets for a hike to Christmas rather than in 2015, prompting sharp movements in interest rate futures. The pound also jumped to a five-year high against a basket of currencies, shares in housebuilders slumped and retail stocks were hurt by the prospect of fresh pressure on already squeezed households. The last time the Bank raised rates was before the crisis back in 2007, and until this week Carney had repeatedly emphasised he and his colleagues on the rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) were in no rush to go back to increases, preferring instead to wait for signs that the recovery was more entrenched. Carney's change of tune was taken as a sign that some MPC members were already pushing for borrowing costs to rise and analysts will be scouring minutes released next week from the latest MPC meeting. A Reuters poll of economists taken after Carney's speech showed they now saw a rate hike in the first quarter of 2015, compared with a forecast for a second-quarter hike in a poll just two weeks earlier. But the Bank has said that when rates do rise it will only be gradually, and in the poll economists said they only saw rates reaching 1.5% by the end of 2015. The talk of higher rates was welcomed by savers and those economists who argue that the solid pace of the economic growth no longer justifies crisis-level borrowing costs. But business groups urged the Bank to be careful not to derail the recovery and there were warnings that households could get into financial difficulty. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the thinktank Resolution Foundation, noted that there were already 1.1m mortgage-holders, or 13% of those with home loans in the UK, saddled with repayments they can barely afford. \"The scale of mortgage debt in this country is still substantial, even after years of economic downturn, and it could start to look precarious for many households over the coming years,\" he said. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group CBI said: \"With the economic recovery firming up nicely, any change in monetary policy should ensure this isn't blown off course.\" Boris Johnson's economics advisor, Gerard Lyons, suggested that the Bank should ease the UK into a world of higher rates, with an \"eighth-point\" hike: \"The Bank of England needs to manage expectations when they hike by opting for small 0.125%. Reinforce gradual message,\" he tweeted. Carney's speech came alongside the move by the chancellor, George Osborne, to give the Bank more powers to rein in mortgage lending and take the heat out of the housing market. That expanded toolkit will be explored by the Bank's financial policy committee when it meets on Tuesday. The prospect of tighter mortgage rules and higher interest rates hit shares in housebuilders Barratt Developments, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey. Meanwhile, the ratings agency Fitch joined the chorus of warnings about Britain's housing market as it kept the UK one notch below the top credit score. Maintaining its AA+ rating for the UK, Fitch highlighted the recent rapid rise in the house price-to-income ratio, in particular in London. There was more upbeat news for the chancellor from Standard and Poor, however. The only one of the three big agencies to rate the UK at the top AAA level revised its credit outlook for the country to \"stable\" from \"negative\" on Friday, citing a broadening economic recovery and \"further progress in consolidating public finances\". \"The stable outlook reflects our opinion that there is a less than one-in-three probability of a downgrade over the next two years,\" it added. It took a more relaxed view of the housing market. \"We do not currently see a possible house price correction as a risk to financial stability,\" the S&amp;P update said.",

The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/13/interest-rate-warning-pound-oil\" title=\"\">pound also jumped to a five-year high against a basket of currencies</a>, shares in housebuilders slumped and retail stocks were hurt by the prospect of fresh pressure on already squeezed households.</p> <p>The last time the Bank raised rates was before the crisis back in 2007, and until this week Carney had repeatedly emphasised he and his colleagues on the rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) were in no rush to go back to increases, preferring instead to wait for signs that the recovery was more entrenched.</p> <p>Carney's change of tune was taken as a sign that some MPC members were already pushing for borrowing costs to rise and analysts will be scouring minutes released next week from the latest MPC meeting.</p> <p>A Reuters poll of economists taken after Carney's speech showed they now saw a rate hike in the first quarter of 2015, compared with a forecast for a second-quarter hike in a poll just two weeks earlier. But the Bank has said that when rates do rise it will only be gradually, and in the poll economists said they only saw rates reaching 1.5% by the end of 2015.</p> <p>The talk of higher rates was welcomed by savers and those economists who argue that the solid pace of the economic growth no longer justifies crisis-level borrowing costs. But business groups urged the Bank to be careful not to derail the recovery and there were warnings that households could get into financial difficulty.</p> <p>Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the thinktank Resolution Foundation, noted that there were already 1.1m mortgage-holders, or 13% of those with home loans in the UK, saddled with repayments they can barely afford.</p> <p>\"The scale of mortgage debt in this country is still substantial, even after years of economic downturn, and it could start to look precarious for many households over the coming years,\" he said.</p> <p>John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group CBI said: \"With the economic recovery firming up nicely, any change in monetary policy should ensure this isn't blown off course.\"</p> <p>Boris Johnson's economics advisor, Gerard Lyons, suggested that the Bank should ease the UK into a world of higher rates, with an \"eighth-point\" hike: \"The Bank of England needs to manage expectations when they hike by opting for small 0.125%. Reinforce gradual message,\" he tweeted.</p> <p>Carney's speech came alongside the move by the chancellor, George Osborne, to give the Bank more powers to rein in mortgage lending and take the heat out of the housing market. That <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/13/bank-of-england-tame-housing-market\" title=\"\">expanded toolkit</a> will be explored by the Bank's financial policy committee when it meets on Tuesday.</p> <p>The prospect of tighter mortgage rules and higher interest rates hit shares in housebuilders Barratt Developments, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the ratings agency <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/13/risky-housing-market-uk-credit-rating-aa-plus\" title=\"\">Fitch joined the chorus of warnings about Britain's housing market</a> as it kept the UK one notch below the top credit score.</p> <p>Maintaining its AA+ rating for the UK, Fitch highlighted the recent rapid rise in the house price-to-income ratio, in particular in London.</p> <p>There was more upbeat news for the chancellor from Standard and Poor, however. The only one of the three big agencies to rate the UK at the top AAA level revised its credit outlook for the country to \"stable\" from \"negative\" on Friday, citing a broadening economic recovery and \"further progress in consolidating public finances\".</p> <p>\"The stable outlook reflects our opinion that there is a less than one-in-three probability of a downgrade over the next two years,\" it added.</p> <p>It took a more relaxed view of the housing market. \"We do not currently see a possible house price correction as a risk to financial stability,\" the S&amp;P update said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain has form when it comes to housing bubbles. Since the early 1970s, there have been powerful booms that have been followed by painful busts. Between them, George Osborne and Mark Carney are trying to avoid a fourth. The problem is simple. Britain is a relatively small island with a relatively large \u2013 and growing \u2013 population. It has tough planning controls that prohibit development on green belts around the country's major cities, and it has a tax system that provides incentives for people to buy bricks and mortar. Even in normal circumstances, keeping demand and supply in balance is hard to achieve, which is why house prices have tended to rise more quickly than the cost of living overall. But it is when money becomes cheap and readily available that the fun really starts. Demand surges, driving up prices, leaving borrowers and the banks that lend to them vulnerable to a crash. That crash comes either when borrowers find the market too hot or when the Bank of England decides that there is a spillover into the rest of the economy and jacks up interest rates in response. The problem with interest rates, though, is that they are a blunt instrument. Threadneedle Street could kill off the property boom by raising borrowing costs to punitive levels, but it has to be aware that there will be collateral damage to the rest of the economy. And with output only just back to the levels it was at before the economy plunged into recession six and a half years ago, both Osborne and Carney want interest rates to be the weapon of last resort. What we have instead is a walk down memory lane to the 1950s and 1960s. Back then, governments of both left and right took action to boost supply and restrict demand, with the result that house prices rose only gently in the first 25 years after the second world war. There were no property booms and no property busts. Fashionable London dinner parties did not think what was happening to the price of a home in Stoke Newington or Dulwich was remotely interesting. On the supply side, the 1950s saw the number of new council homes peak at 300,000 a year. Greater affluence also led to more private homes being built, so that by the mid 1960s house building peaked at more than 400,000 a year. There were also measures for curbing demand. The Treasury and the Bank used an array of credit controls to limit how much lenders could provide and how much individuals could borrow. Building societies, the main providers of mortgages, operated as a cartel, all offering the same rate. The new arrangements announced by Osborne in Thursday's Mansion House speech hark back to this pre-bubble age. He is trying to boost the supply of homes by forcing councils to free up brownfield sites for development. And he is giving the Bank back the power to give orders to lenders about how much they can lend to first-time buyers. The Bank's financial policy committee meets next week to consider whether rising house prices present a significant risk and what \u2013 if any \u2013 action is warranted. But the proposed shake-up of planning will at best result in 200,000 homes being built. The prospect of a return to the days when 400,000 homes were being built each year looks a long way off. Osborne's critics, such as the free-market Institute for Economic Affairs, say that he needs to be bolder by giving developers the right to build on the green belt, which is more than twice the size of Britain's urban footprint. Others say that supply is not the issue at all. Danny Gabay, of the economic consultancy Fathom, says the number of new homes has been increasing at 0.6% a year, precisely the same rate at which the population has been increasing. The problem, Gabay says, is all on the demand side. \"The high level of house prices in the UK, relative to incomes, has nothing to do with a shortage of housing and everything to do with a combination of exceptionally low mortgage rates, and subsidised access to mortgage credit.\" Neither Osborne nor Carney thinks there is going to be a rapid increase in the number of new houses built. Both know that an increase in interest rates is inevitable at some point, and the Bank's governor went out of his way on Thursday to warn that this might be sooner than people think. What concerns them is that household debt is at high levels despite the efforts of many borrowers to reduce their financial exposure since the crash. Loan to income ratios for first-time buyers are already at record levels. Clearly rates are not going to remain at 0.5% for ever. Given that even relatively modest rises in rates will hurt, the aim is to use macro-prudential tools (as credit controls are now called) to limit both the pace at which borrowing costs rise and the level that they have to rise to. Hence the walk down memory lane.",

So Miele built a special rack to hold the plastic bricks, and any other small pieces likely to jump about during the cycle.</p> <p>It is this kind of attention to detail, along with the durability of the products \u2013 a Miele washing machine should last 5,000 cycles \u2013 that Miele says has convinced his customers to pay seriously high prices for the company's appliances \u2013 up to \u00a32,800 for a washing machine, albeit one that claims to cut the amount of ironing required afterwards by 50%. Or maybe \u00a32,500 for a mobile Teppan grill, and another \u00a32,500 for a wine cooler.</p> <p>Miele is actually a two-family business that has lasted four generations. Carl Miele's partner was Reinhard Zinkann, and today Markus runs the company alongside Zinkann's great-grandson, also called Reinhard, with ownership split 51%-49% between the Miele and Zinkann families.</p> <p>The firm has maintained its independence under the twin-family control through two world wars and without recourse to stock markets. The recent economic crisis has also been weathered. Revenues rose nearly 4% last year to \u00a32.6bn.</p> <p>Miele and Zinkann now have children who could eventually take up the reins, although not yet given that the eldest is just 19. The elder Miele says there is no pressure to hand over the baton. \"We've seen a number of our electrical retailers, if they force their kids inside the business and then the business is not growing, it's not only bad for the business, but it's also bad for the family. Most of the time the better solution is to sell the business or give it to somebody else.\"</p> <p>But right now the Miele business is growing. Sales are surging in the US and among the new middle classes of Russia and China. The UK is also having a double-digit growth spurt, propelled by the property boom in the capital. \"I was a little bit surprised, even shocked by house prices,\" says Miele, who is in the capital on a flying visit. This astonishment at London's house prices comes from a man whose top-of-the-range coffee machine will set you back \u00a33,300.</p> <p>Even in Greece, where in 2010 Miele suffered as public spending cuts tipped many homes into poverty, normal service is resuming. \"Last year was the first growth in Greece for seven years,\" he says. \"The spirit is coming back. They are saying this is now the bottom, we can't fall any further.\"</p> <p>Miele, who joined the family firm in 1999 and became managing director three years later, runs the research department and the factories. About 80% of production still takes place in Germany. Zinkann, who is a decade older than 45-year-old Miele, travels the world organising sales and distribution through 47 international subsidiaries.</p> <p>Miele's first products were butter churns, some of which spun horizontally. Very soon, these morphed into Miele's first washing machines, which were initially made of wood. By 1929, the firm had produced electrical washing machines, dishwashers and vacuum cleaners.</p> <p>The years since the second world war have been dedicated to refining the appliances, bringing them to the mass market, and expanding abroad: 70% of revenues come from outside Germany.</p> <p>Since the digital revolution took hold, white goods have been left in something of a technological backwater. But the internet of things means that is now changing rapidly. Electrical appliances are now part of the 21st-century tech boom. This month Apple announced a software platform for the home, which lets householders control everything from lightbulbs to boilers and garage doors from their smartphones. Leave the house, and you can tell your phone to lock the doors, switch off the lights and make sure the oven isn't on. Google has ambitions in this space too.</p> <p>Miele now has intelligent household appliances that communicate via broadband. Its tumble drier will send an email when the filter needs de-fluffing, its fridge will text when the door has been left open, and in Germany, where the price of electricity can vary according to the time of day, the washing machine can be programmed to start a new load when energy is cheapest \u2013 so long as the home has a smart meter.</p> <p>Steve Jobs, whose phones first popularised the touchscreen, was a Miele customer, as are David Beckham and Madonna. Jobs once described to a journalist how European washing machines were better than American ones because they were kinder to clothes by using less water and detergent, even though they took twice as long to complete a cycle.</p> <p>Miele was flattered but baffled when he read the interview. \"He said he was discussing for two weeks with the family about a washing machine,\" he says. \"I was thinking about the family life \u2026 it is difficult to imagine talking for two weeks to my family about a washing machine. But it was interesting because he looked at all the details, energy consumption and so on and then decided.\"</p> <p>With ownership of the business shared by an unwieldy 71 descendants, making decisions can take time. \"The company comes first, then the family. We have never had any voting on anything that wasn't 100%.\"</p> <p>A family council, with three people from each clan, meets four times a year. If Miele and Zinkann cannot agree, the finance director, Olaf Bartsch, one of the five-person management team, intervenes.</p> <p>Miele, whose ascendancy to the top job was never guaranteed, studied industrial engineering and worked at another family-run firm, the car parts maker Helle, before being offered a post in his father's company. Before he joined, he had to make a presentation and be interviewed by a recruitment agency, which gave a second opinion on whether he was capable.</p> <p>Given that Miele is really a partnership, it seems unfair that the Zinkanns have still not got their name above the door, let alone on the products. But the company's motto is <em>immer besser</em>, which means forever better, and Miele says discussion focuses on how to improve the merchandise rather than rebrand the business or redistribute the shares.</p> <p>\"My grandfather said whenever this doesn't work out, I can take another partner into the company.

Wood, a former economist at the Bank of England, said: \"The message was caveated, but Carney would have been well aware of the probable impact of his words. He would not have chosen the words lightly, which makes them significant. The change in tone was sensible, in our view. Record low interest rates are increasingly unnecessary.\" The price of oil rose to its highest since September owing to fears that violence in Iraq could disrupt supplies from one of the world's biggest producers. The Brent Crude price rose 0.6% to $113.68 after Barack Obama said the US was looking at all options to help the Baghdad government repel Sunni jihadists who have seized three of the country's biggest cities. A prolonged spike in the oil price could also put upward pressure on interest rates by increasing the cost of energy and other goods.",
