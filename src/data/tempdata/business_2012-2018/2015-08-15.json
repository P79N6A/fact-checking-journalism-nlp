      "bodyText": "After China unexpectedly devalued its currency last week, one City economist shrugged despairingly and said: \u201cIt\u2019s August.\u201d While it\u2019s meant to be a time for heading for the beach or kicking back in the sunshine with the kids, August has often witnessed the first cracks that presaged what later became profound shifts in the tectonic plates of the global economy \u2014 from the Russian debt default in 1998, to what Northern Rock boss Adam Applegarth called \u201cthe day the world changed,\u201d when the first ripples of the credit crunch were felt in 2007; to August 2011, when ratings agency Standard and Poor\u2019s sent shockwaves through financial markets by stripping America of its triple-AAA credit rating. Taking the long view, last week\u2019s devaluation by China, which left the yuan about 3% weaker against the dollar, was relatively modest \u2014 sterling had lost 16% of its value in 1967 when Harold Wilson sought to reassure the British public about the \u201cpound in your pocket\u201d. But China\u2019s decision represented the largest yuan depreciation for 20 years; and the ripples may yet be felt thousands of miles away. So what difference will it make to the rest of the world? 1. It could be serious China\u2019s devaluation may be best seen as a distress signal from Beijing policymakers \u2013 in which case the world\u2019s second-largest economy may be far weaker than the 7% a year growth that official figures suggests. China has been trying to engineer a shift from export-led growth to an expansion based on consumer spending \u2013 while simultaneously trying to deflate a property bubble. Last week\u2019s move, which loosened the yuan\u2019s link to the value of the dollar, suggested some policymakers may be losing patience with that strategy, and reaching for the familiar prop of a cheap currency. Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman described the decision as \u201cthe first bite of the cherry,\u201d suggesting more could follow, and in a reference to Chinese president Xi Jinping, warned that such a modest move gave the impression that, \u201cwhen it comes to economic policy Xi-who-must-be-obeyed has no idea what he\u2019s doing\u201d. If its economy really is much weaker than Beijing has let on, it would be alarming for any company hoping to export to China \u2014 something firms in Britain have been encouraged to do in recent years, to lessen reliance on the stodgy European economies. China was the sixth-largest destination for British exports last year. China will remain a vast market; but it may not be quite such a one-way bet as some analysts have suggested. And when it comes to the challenges facing Chinese policymakers, Russell Jones, of consultancy Llewellyn Consulting says: \u201cThe potential for getting this wrong is quite high.\u201d 2. A less costly Christmas China has been trying to shift from being a vast factory producing cut-price consumer goods for the rest of the world. Yet glance at the label on almost any T-shirt or toy \u2013 let alone consumer gadget \u2013 and it\u2019s still likely to read \u201cMade in China\u201d. A country\u2019s currency is not the only determinant of how much its goods will cost when they reach the high street: Chinese wages have been rising, making its products less competitive, and the price of raw materials and shipping is also important. However, the devalued yuan will force China\u2019s Asian rivals, such as Indonesia and South Korea, to compete even harder in response; and the result may be a few pence off the price of Chinese-made Christmas presents. Martin Beck, of consultancy Oxford Economics, says, \u201cAlmost 9% of the UK\u2019s goods imports come from China, a share that has doubled over the last decade.\u201d So there will be a direct disinflationary effect from cheaper imports. 3. Cheaper petrol at the pump China\u2019s apparently insatiable demand for natural resources has been a key factors supporting the price of oil in recent years. So fears that China\u2019s economy is in trouble tend to undermine oil prices \u2013 and that probably means cheaper petrol in Britain. Of course, there are other factors, including strong oil production in the US; but global oil prices resumed their decline last week following China\u2019s move, dipping back below $50 a barrel. In coming months, weak Chinese demand could force down the cost of many commodities, from oil to iron ore. 4. Delayed rate rises Central bankers in the US and the UK have been issuing warnings for months that, with growth strengthening, they are preparing to start pushing up interest rates \u2013 reversing the emergency cuts made in the global credit crunch. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has suggested \u201cthe turn of the year\u201d might be the moment to consider tightening monetary policy (ie raising rates); Janet Yellen at the US Federal Reserve has signalled that an increase could come as early as September. However, if the cheaper yuan cuts the price of imports, this will undermine inflation, which is already at zero in the UK; and could delay a rate rise. A renewed bout of market turbulence as global investors assess the implications of China\u2019s decision could have the same effect. 5. Deflation, deflation, deflation In the short term, lower-than-expected borrowing costs will benefit indebted consumers in the west \u2013 including Britain\u2019s mortgage-holders. But some analysts believe China\u2019s decision is the latest evidence of a deep-seated lack of demand in the global economy, which will unleash deflation. Brief periods of falling prices \u2013 particularly if concentrated among one or two commodities \u2013 can be good news; but economists fret about periods of persistently falling prices, which can undermine spending and investment and feed through to wages, as consumers and businesses delay spending, expecting goods to be even cheaper in future. And if a fresh downturn does come, central bankers have little ammunition left to tackle it, since interest rates in the US, the UK and Europe are already on the floor. Economist Ann Pettifor, of thinktank Prime, who foreshadowed the credit crunch in her 2006 book, The Coming First World Debt Crisis, believes the developed economies face some of the challenges felt by Japan during its \u201clost decade\u201d, when it suffered both deflation and weak demand \u2013 but unlike Japan, many developed economies, not least the UK, would enter any new crisis under a heavy burden of borrowing. \u201cIt\u2019s the pressure of debt on consumers, corporates, municipalities,\u201d Pettifor says, raising the spectre of the kind of debt trap identified by the US economist Irving Fisher in the wake of the Great Depression. Not everyone is so pessimistic, and Carney has shrugged off the idea that deflation is a threat in the UK; but as Neil Mellor, of BNY Mellon, put it in a research note on Friday, \u201cas we watch and wait, the market will be anxiously aware that a sustained depreciation could have ramifications across the globe by shifting the inflation dynamic at a most inopportune time.\u201d 6. Tough times for Oz Australia has experienced an impressive economic boom in recent years on the back of selling natural resources, including coal and iron ore, to its Asian neighbours, and China accounts for more than a quarter of its exports. So weakness in the Chinese economy is bad news for Australia. Research by consultancy Oxford Economics last week, which modelled the impact of a 10% Chinese devaluation, accompanied by a sharp slowdown, suggested other hard-hit countries could include Brazil, Russia, Chile and Korea. 7. Even more pain for Greece If the Chinese devaluation does bring what one City analyst, Albert Edwards, last week called a \u201ctidal wave of deflation\u201d to the global economy, the most vulnerable countries will be those that are heavily in debt \u2013 because while wages and profits fall in a deflationary period, the value of debts remains fixed, making them harder to service (to pay interest on). And economies where consumer demand and confidence is already weak tend to be hit harder by the reduced spending that deflation can bring. As economists at consultancy Fathom said last week, \u201cperipheral European economies\u201d, not least crisis-hit Greece, fit that definition. Greece is already suffering deflation after repeated cuts in wages and benefits as the government tries to balance the books, and if it worsens, that will only make its gargantuan debts \u2013 worth more than 170% of the size of the economy \u2013 harder to service. 8. Currency wars Beijing\u2019s move was ostensibly offered as part of measures to open up its financial system, and allow foreign exchange markets more say over the value of the yuan \u2013 something America has long demanded as evidence that China is genuinely open to financial reform. The International Monetary Fund described the move as welcome. But the devaluation was nevertheless greeted angrily in Washington. New York senator Chuck Schumer said: \u201cFor years, China has rigged the rules and played games with its currency, leaving American workers out to dry. Rather than changing their ways, the Chinese government seems to be doubling down.\u201d Republican senator and former US trade representative Rob Portman accused China of trying to gain an unfair trade advantage over America though \u201ccurrency manipulation\u201d \u2013 just as the US is negotiating an important trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with a number of China\u2019s rivals, including Japan. If Beijing allows the yuan to decline further in coming months, it could increase trade tensions, or even a \u201ccurrency war\u201d, in which the world\u2019s big trading blocs face off in a beggar-thy-neighbour battle to seize the largest possible share of global consumer demand. For now, a 4% devaluation in the yuan is more of a hairline crack in the world economic order than a seismic shift; but policymakers will be weighing up its consequences long after they return from their summer break. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 August 2015.

      "bodyText": "Conglomerates have been distinctly unfashionable among investors for decades. But that may be about to change. Just as Warren Buffett put the final touches to a $37.2bn deal to add a nuts-and-bolts maker to his sprawling Berkshire Hathaway empire last week, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin unveiled a restructuring that borrowed liberally from the sage of Omaha\u2019s rulebook. Suddenly, the word \u201cconglomerate\u201d, not heard frequently in the UK since the heyday of Hanson Trust in the 1980s, is on everybody\u2019s lips. Google\u2019s founders have always admired Buffett. Google\u2019s IPO letter to shareholders in 2004 disclosed that it was inspired by the octogenarian\u2019s essays in Berkshire\u2019s annual reports. And when asked recently how Google would manage an ambitious expansion without becoming bloated and impossible to run, Page said he would follow the example set by the famed investor. So when the technology group announced a restructuring last week, with various businesses operating under the umbrella of a holding company called Alphabet, it was no surprise that analysts detected the subconscious influence of Buffett. Stifel analyst Scott Devitt labelled Google the Berkshire Hathaway of the internet. Google is proposing a structure in which the profitable search business funnels some profits into its more speculative ventures like driverless cars or Calico, which aims to extend the human lifespan. Page explains: \u201cAlphabet is mostly a collection of companies, the largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead.\u201d There are those who feel the Buffett analogy is not fair on the investor. His businesses \u2013 from brickmaking to clothing and insurance \u2013 might be run under a similar structure to the one being described by Page, but they are expected to be profitable in the medium term. He is not trying to develop new businesses but reinvigorate old ones. And his model relies on well-timed acquisitions. \u201cGoogle\u2019s Alphabet sounds like a 21st-century Berkshire Hathaway, but with a lot of very large venture bets,\u201d Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive, tweeted last week. Some also fear the greater transparency of Alphabet will be damaging to the experimental businesses, such as driverless cars and kite turbines. \u201cStartups remain private for a reason,\u201d says Scott DeRue, professor of management at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cThe primary reason is that management in startups can take full risks and be free to make errors. The market is going to increase the pressure on the moonshot businesses under this structure.\u201d DeRue thinks the newer businesses under the Alphabet umbrella will not thrive without strong-willed executives driving them on. \u201cIf they can withstand the market pressure and maintain a high level of exploration, then it could work,\u201d he believes. But that is a big if.",

      "body": "<p>Conglomerates have been distinctly unfashionable among investors for decades. But that may be about to change.</p> <p>Just as Warren Buffett put the final touches to a $37.2bn deal to add a nuts-and-bolts maker to his sprawling Berkshire Hathaway empire last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/10/google-alphabet-parent-company\" title=\"\">Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin unveiled a restructuring</a> that borrowed liberally from the sage of Omaha\u2019s rulebook.</p> <p>Suddenly, the word \u201cconglomerate\u201d, not heard frequently in the UK since the heyday of Hanson Trust in the 1980s, is on everybody\u2019s lips.</p> <p>Google\u2019s founders have always admired Buffett. Google\u2019s IPO letter to shareholders in 2004 disclosed that it was inspired by the octogenarian\u2019s essays in Berkshire\u2019s annual reports. And when asked recently how Google would manage an ambitious expansion without becoming bloated and impossible to run, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3173f19e-5fbc-11e4-8c27-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"\">Page said he would follow the example set by the famed investor</a>.</p> <p>So when the technology group announced a restructuring last week, with various businesses operating under the umbrella of a holding company called Alphabet, it was no surprise that analysts detected the subconscious influence of Buffett. Stifel analyst Scott Devitt labelled Google <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/08/12/is-google-really-becoming-the-berkshire-hathaway-of-the-internet/\" title=\"\">the Berkshire Hathaway of the internet</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c11bee35b3b1d5fa2a442ac4db6a0a2e73d351c3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/14/1439574559006/80a3b5ea-b40b-44fb-9ab2-42a4db668879-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Warren Buffett\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warren Buffett: sprawling empire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevork Djansezian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Google is proposing a structure in which the profitable search business funnels some profits into its more speculative ventures like driverless cars or Calico, which aims to extend the human lifespan.</p> <p>Page explains: \u201cAlphabet is mostly a collection of companies, the largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead.\u201d</p> <p>There are those who feel the Buffett analogy is not fair on the investor. His <a href=\"http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/subs/sublinks.html\" title=\"\">businesses</a> \u2013 from brickmaking to clothing and insurance \u2013 might be run under a similar structure to the one being described by Page, but they are expected to be profitable in the medium term. He is not trying to develop new businesses but reinvigorate old ones. And his model relies on well-timed acquisitions. \u201cGoogle\u2019s Alphabet sounds like a 21st-century Berkshire Hathaway, but with a lot of very large venture bets,\u201d Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive, tweeted last week.</p> <p>Some also fear the greater transparency of Alphabet will be damaging to the experimental businesses, such as driverless cars and kite turbines.</p> <p>\u201cStartups remain private for a reason,\u201d says <a href=\"https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/scott-derue\" title=\"\">Scott DeRue</a>, professor of management at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cThe primary reason is that management in startups can take full risks and be free to make errors. The market is going to increase the pressure on the moonshot businesses under this structure.\u201d</p> <p>DeRue thinks the newer businesses under the Alphabet umbrella will not thrive without strong-willed executives driving them on. \u201cIf they can withstand the market pressure and maintain a high level of exploration, then it could work,\u201d he believes. But that is a big if.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Legendary investor Warren Buffett likes to think of his keynote deals as elephants. The one he unveiled last week, a $37.2bn (\u00a323.8bn) takeover of Precision Castparts, a supplier of parts for aircraft, has trumped all his other solo deals to stand as the largest. Buffett\u2019s move took place against the backdrop of an increasingly buoyant global mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) market that could see deal values for this year topping pre-crash totals. US deals are already well on their way to beating their previous high of 2007; the UK is quieter, but nevertheless keeping investment bankers busy. UK deal values this year have already surpassed last year\u2019s annual figure, according to data firm Dealogic, and a London-based deal, Shell\u2019s $81.5bn proposed takeover of oil and gas explorer BG, tops the list of global transactions so far. But Britain is still some way short of its peak, with this year\u2019s deals, at $233bn to date, well below the $485bn for the year achieved in 2000. US deal values so far this year stand, at $1.51tn, already close to last year\u2019s full-year figure of $1.55tn, and will surely beat the previous record total of $1.56tn in 2000. The global figure, swollen by an upsurge in Asian deals, broke through $3tn last week, not far short of last year\u2019s annual total of $3.6 trillion. Despite faltering growth in the eurozone and the more dramatic market fluctuations in China, investment bankers say conditions are right for a continuing merger boom, especially while interest rates remain low and most of the world\u2019s equity markets are reasonably stable. \u201cThe deals being announced are highly strategic transactions,\u201d says David Lomer, co-head of M&amp;A in Europe and the Middle East for JP Morgan. \u201cThere\u2019s appetite and confidence among corporates to make strategic moves that will materially evolve their businesses and we expect this to continue.\u201d In fact, the weakness of the euro is one of the magnets for some cross-border deals, according to Lomer. \u201cThere\u2019s a realisation that economies in Europe are recovering but the euro has yet to follow. For chief executives in Asia and North America, the strategic partners they have assessed for years now cost 15-20% less in yuan or dollar terms than they did 18 months ago.\u201d The sum of $37.2bn might constitute an elephant-sized deal for Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway Group, which has made investments that range from railroad companies to Duracell in recent years. But the size of the deal only just puts it in Dealogic\u2019s top 10. There have been some very big elephants indeed in 2015, including the $62.6bn merger between food giants Kraft and Heinz, in which Buffett is also involved (as a shareholder in Heinz). Even that only comes in fourth on the list. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so far this year more deals above $10bn than we\u2019ve ever had before,\u201d says Luigi Rizzo, head of M&amp;A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cA lot of industry severely needed to consolidate after a subdued few years.\u201d Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is paying a high price for his latest deal. Yet many analysts are prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. After all, they say, the sage of Omaha, as he is known, is riding the M&amp;A wave and he is one of the best at timing his deals. And interest rates are low, making financing costs historically cheap. \u201cOur view of this deal is favourable because Berkshire\u2019s acquisition will enhance its exposure to increased secular demand for aerospace travel,\u201d says Jay Gelb, an analyst at Barclays. Bankers say investors are currently in the mood to back deals that consolidate industries, or put two companies together to make them strategically stronger. They are less keen to back deals just because the M&amp;A cycle is on the up. Certainly shareholders are in a receptive mood if the right deal comes along. \u201cConfidence is building and boards and shareholders are more comfortable backing the right strategic moves today than 12 or 24 months ago,\u201d says Lomer. \u201cThis is playing out with record numbers of transactions using shares, and we\u2019re seeing an unprecedented favourable reaction from the market, with buyer share prices up 4-5% on average.\u201d Over three quarters of deals involving listed companies in Europe this year have involved shares. Also, central bankers\u2019 response to the financial crisis has helped, Lomer continues. \u201cQuantitative easing in Europe has lowered both the euro and the cost of financing for acquirers making relative values historically attractive between international and European companies.\u201d The three best performing sectors have been \u201cTMT\u201d \u2013 technology, media and telecommunications \u2013 oil and gas, and healthcare. Charter Communications\u2019 $79.6bn acquisition of US rival Time Warner Cable leads the TMT sector, where industry consolidation is in overdrive. The falling oil price \u2013 it dipped below $50 per barrel last week \u2013 has also led to consolidation in the exploration and production sector, where Shell is buying BG for $81.5bn and Energy Transfer of the US has launched a $70.6bn bid for rival pipeline operator Williams Companies. Israeli pharmaceuticals company Teva\u2019s $40.5bn purchase of Allergan\u2019s generic business tops the pharma deals. The Dealogic figures also include demergers, such as PayPal\u2019s spin-off from eBay, on the grounds it represents a change of economic ownership. A further sign of how the latest M&amp;A boom marks a recovery from the banking crash is the deal activity among financial services companies. Last week, two annuity-focused insurers that had been hit by changes in government regulation, Just Retirement and Partnership, announced a \u00a31.6bn merger. \u201cThere are a lot of strong undercurrents underpinning M&amp;A in the financial services sector,\u201d says Malik Karim, chief executive of Fenchurch Advisory, who worked on the deal. \u201cDespite pockets of macro uncertainty, the market is pretty stable compared to the dislocation after the financial crisis, and the low interest-rate environment and relatively open equity markets are conducive to financing transactions.\u201d He adds: \u201cThere is also a lot of CEO confidence out there following leadership changes, which has ushered in a generation of new leaders who are either minded to grow or sell businesses which may have been \u2018sacred cows\u2019.\u201d Bankers are predicting that global takeover-deal announcements this year could reach the record-breaking $4.6tn achieved in 2007 if the current pace of activity continues. This is due in part to emerging economies becoming even more powerful since the crash. \u201cThe new news is Asia,\u201d says Lomer. \u201cFor corporates with slowing domestic markets there\u2019s a real appetite for international growth and a desire for crossborder transactions to accelerate it. \u201cThis is being joined by a wave of new investment capital from Asia that is seeing attractive opportunities to invest in Europe. These two effects are driving an unprecedented interest in the region from the major Asian economies.\u201d Such activity might spark fears of a bubble, but many are confident that the market is not getting ahead of itself. They say prices aren\u2019t increasing as fast as in earlier pre-crash periods and valuations are still in what they consider \u201cnormal territory\u201d. They add that there is no sign that over-the-top borrowing \u2013 a hallmark of any bubble \u2013 is financing the recent deals. The risks appear to be macroeconomic, such as the fear of interest rates rising faster than expected, a lack of liquidity in the bond markets and the recent market fluctuations in China. \u201cThe current turbulence in China, where the currency has been depreciating amid fears of slowing growth, is clearly a risk factor,\u201d says Bank of America\u2019s Rizzo. But he adds: \u201cThere\u2019s still a belief that the Chinese authorities have the ability to manage the markets when they need to.\u201d If fears over China are kept in check and do not destabilise international markets for a sustained period, bankers say there is no reason why deal values for 2015 shouldn\u2019t top the 2007 total. The expectation, therefore, is that there will be more elephants before the end of the year. But Buffett, having pulled off his own record deal, has ruled out adding to the herd for a while.",
