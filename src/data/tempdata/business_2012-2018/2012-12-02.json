Even with Switzerland's famously low tax rates, Glasenberg, pictured above, paid 360m Swiss francs (\u00a3242m) in tax to R\u00fcschlikon's coffers because under Swiss law a large proportion of income taxes are paid to the local community rather than directly to the state.</p> <p>As a result R\u00fcschlikon, which was already known as the \"richest village in Switzerland\", was left with so much spare cash that the village council proposed cutting its already low tax rate by a further 7%. The idea was overwhelmingly approved in a public vote, but some citizens argued against the windfall \u2013 suggesting it was tainted money \u2013 and are still concerned today.</p> <p>The money which R\u00fcschlikon is benefiting from comes via Glencore's mining and trading operations in more than 40 countries around the world. \"He [Glasenberg] covers a lot of territory and has access to a lot of heads of state,\" said James Campbell, a former executive at mining multinational Anglo American who worked closely with Glasenberg on one of his first deals in the 1980s. \"His modus operandi is active. Certainly you either like Ivan or you don't. I'm not sure those who don't like him can tell you why.\"</p> <p>Growing up, Glasenberg was a keen athlete, going on to become a champion race walker who would have competed in the 1984 Olympics if South Africa had not been banned from the competition during the apartheid period. Chris Rael, who trained with him in California in the 1980s and now works for the US athletics team, remembers Glasenberg as courteous, friendly and approachable. \"He never talked about money or business, so I would never have suspected that was what he'd become.\"While Glasenberg, who lives in a glass and steel chalet up a steep hill with views over the lake, is on first-name terms with presidents and prime ministers, few people in R\u00fcschlikon had heard of him until his taxes reached the village coffers. The huge payment caused an immediate stir, with the mayor being advised to call the village's bank to make sure it was prepared to receive such a large payment.</p> <p>In Le Bistro cafe in the converted waiting room of R\u00fcschlikon station, from where the village's rich residents can be whisked to downtown Zurich in 15 minutes, none of the clientele whiling away the afternoon have met Glasenberg but all are happy to chat about his impact on the community.</p> <p>\"They are really happy with him paying a lot of taxes,\" said waitress Sylvia Hauser. \"But they don't like his business, they don't like what he is doing. It's not very friendly and they do not agree with what he does, especially in&#xa0;Africa.</p> <p>\"[Glencore] is cheating other people, taking things out of the ground and not paying [much in taxes in the countries in which it operates] and selling it at a lot of profit.\"</p> <p>Further down the quiet road winding down the hill towards the calm waters of Lake Zurich, the manager of one of the village's opulent boutiques, who did not wish to be named, said: \"A lot of people think it [Glencore] is bad for the world. We have a lot of money, we don't need money from Mr Glasenberg. It is not right to close the eyes and take the money. I can't say that he is a bad man \u2013 I do not know him \u2013 but I have heard about what he does.\"</p> <p>R\u00fcschlikon resident Daniel Zbinden said: \"We don't want his money; it is bad money that comes from the bad things Glencore does in Africa.\"</p> <p>Some of the locals decided to try and use some of the windfall to redress the balance between the wealth of Glasenberg's village and the poverty endured by many of the communities where Glencore operates. Peter Cadisch set up the Solidarity R\u00fcschlikon campaign calling for the village to cut taxes by 5% rather than 7% and to send the rest of the money \"back to where the particular workers in the commodity trade generated it\".</p> <p>The proposal led to the most highly attended meeting in R\u00fcschlikon's history, when 424 people turned out to vote in the village hall that seats 280. The full tax cut was voted through by a&#xa0;big majority.</p> <p>But many residents still have concerns, including the mayor, Dr Bernhard Elsener, a professor at a nearby university. \"We know that Glencore is accused of not acting well in developing countries, but the business that Glencore is performing around the world is considered legal [and] we have no means to discuss about the origin of this money,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I agree Glencore as a company is accused by NGOs [non-governmental organisations] that not everything is going as it should. They [Glencore] do not communicate very frequently, which is also a problem.\"</p> <p>In May 2011 an NGO in Switzerland, Berne Declaration, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/19/glencore-in-dark-ages-says-ngo-boss\" title=\"\">claimed Glencore lagged behind other mining companies on a range of ethical and environmental issues</a>, such as corporate responsibility and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Glencore denied the&#xa0;charge.</p> <p>Elsener says the village would have been unable to reject the money even if the electorate voted to, because the localised tax system is mandated by federal Swiss law.</p> <p>Elsener said he received two letters of complaint after the villagers voted to&#xa0;allow Glasenberg to become a naturalised Swiss citizen two years ago.</p> <p>While none of the residents the Guardian spoke to had seen Glasenberg in the village in the 18 years he has been living in R\u00fcschlikon, Elsener said he had several discussions with the businessman to \"make sure he was good enough in German [the local language of the area] in order to make sure he can communicate\".</p> <p>\"He is a very interesting personality, but because he's travelling a lot around the whole world maybe he's not in R\u00fcschlikon that often.\"</p> <p>Concern about Glasenberg's millions has now spread to other parts of the canton. Yvonne Beutler, the finance director of nearby Winterthur village council, which is to receive a big proportion of the money via a complex system that diverts more of the funds to the poorest villages, told the local newspaper: \"I am not really happy about this money. I can't ignore who is actually paying the price for this and I don't like the fact that a few commodity traders make billions while the people in the producing countries remain bitterly poor.\"</p> <p>In the interview with Der Landbote, Beutler said Switzerland's MPs had a moral responsibility to question \"how much longer our country shall remain an oasis for commodity trading regarding transparency and regulations\".</p> <p>A Glencore spokeperson told the Guardian that the company believes \"sustainability must be an integral part of everything we do\"</p> <p>\"We have put a corporate sustainability framework in place to balance social, environmental, ethical and commercial interests at every level of our group. This framework is called Glencore Corporate Practice, or GCP. We have designed and implemented GCP to meet internationally recognised, sector-specific, good practice standards.\"</p>",

It's not very friendly and they do not agree with what he does, especially in Africa. \"[Glencore] is cheating other people, taking things out of the ground and not paying [much in taxes in the countries in which it operates] and selling it at a lot of profit.\" Further down the quiet road winding down the hill towards the calm waters of Lake Zurich, the manager of one of the village's opulent boutiques, who did not wish to be named, said: \"A lot of people think it [Glencore] is bad for the world. We have a lot of money, we don't need money from Mr Glasenberg. It is not right to close the eyes and take the money. I can't say that he is a bad man \u2013 I do not know him \u2013 but I have heard about what he does.\" R\u00fcschlikon resident Daniel Zbinden said: \"We don't want his money; it is bad money that comes from the bad things Glencore does in Africa.\" Some of the locals decided to try and use some of the windfall to redress the balance between the wealth of Glasenberg's village and the poverty endured by many of the communities where Glencore operates. Peter Cadisch set up the Solidarity R\u00fcschlikon campaign calling for the village to cut taxes by 5% rather than 7% and to send the rest of the money \"back to where the particular workers in the commodity trade generated it\". The proposal led to the most highly attended meeting in R\u00fcschlikon's history, when 424 people turned out to vote in the village hall that seats 280. The full tax cut was voted through by a big majority. But many residents still have concerns, including the mayor, Dr Bernhard Elsener, a professor at a nearby university. \"We know that Glencore is accused of not acting well in developing countries, but the business that Glencore is performing around the world is considered legal [and] we have no means to discuss about the origin of this money,\" he said. \"I agree Glencore as a company is accused by NGOs [non-governmental organisations] that not everything is going as it should. They [Glencore] do not communicate very frequently, which is also a problem.\" In May 2011 an NGO in Switzerland, Berne Declaration, claimed Glencore lagged behind other mining companies on a range of ethical and environmental issues, such as corporate responsibility and CO2 emissions. Glencore denied the charge. Elsener says the village would have been unable to reject the money even if the electorate voted to, because the localised tax system is mandated by federal Swiss law. Elsener said he received two letters of complaint after the villagers voted to allow Glasenberg to become a naturalised Swiss citizen two years ago. While none of the residents the Guardian spoke to had seen Glasenberg in the village in the 18 years he has been living in R\u00fcschlikon, Elsener said he had several discussions with the businessman to \"make sure he was good enough in German [the local language of the area] in order to make sure he can communicate\". \"He is a very interesting personality, but because he's travelling a lot around the whole world maybe he's not in R\u00fcschlikon that often.\" Concern about Glasenberg's millions has now spread to other parts of the canton. Yvonne Beutler, the finance director of nearby Winterthur village council, which is to receive a big proportion of the money via a complex system that diverts more of the funds to the poorest villages, told the local newspaper: \"I am not really happy about this money. I can't ignore who is actually paying the price for this and I don't like the fact that a few commodity traders make billions while the people in the producing countries remain bitterly poor.\" In the interview with Der Landbote, Beutler said Switzerland's MPs had a moral responsibility to question \"how much longer our country shall remain an oasis for commodity trading regarding transparency and regulations\". A Glencore spokeperson told the Guardian that the company believes \"sustainability must be an integral part of everything we do\" \"We have put a corporate sustainability framework in place to balance social, environmental, ethical and commercial interests at every level of our group. This framework is called Glencore Corporate Practice, or GCP. We have designed and implemented GCP to meet internationally recognised, sector-specific, good practice standards.\"",

      "bodyText": "Recessions are usually job killers, so the way in which the UK economy has created new jobs at a time when growth has been so weak has baffled the experts. Employment is up even though national output has been flat over the past year. Economists have been searching high and low for an explanation. Is Britain actually doing a lot better than the official data suggests? If so, the double-dip recession will be revised away in due course. Has the UK become less efficient, with more people needed to provide the same quantity of goods and services? It could be the expansion of part-time work \u2013 people working 20 hours week when they would actually like to be working 40. Official data last week showed underemployment in the economy has risen by 1 million since the recession began. Robin Chater, the secretary-general of the Federation of European Employers has a different explanation: labour is dirt cheap in Britain and that encourages firms to boost output by hiring or retaining workers rather than by investing in new plant and machinery. Since 2005, Chater says, capital replacement has been falling faster in Britain than in any European country. This is confirmed by official figures for investment as a share of national output, which at 13.9% is the lowest since records began in 1955. \"The UK is turning into an old-style third world country with low pay growth for most workers below managerial level, widening pay differentials and poor levels of capital investment,\" Chater says. \"This has been partly encouraged by the influx of workers from eastern Europe since 2004 \u2013 who have been willing to perform many functions at low wage rates that would have been otherwise automated.\" Governments of both left and right have said their aim is to turn Britain into a high-wage, high-productivity economy that competes with countries such as China and India on the basis of quality and technological expertise rather than cost. The opposite appears to be happening. Some might argue that an economy that is creating low-wage employment is preferable to one that is creating no jobs at all. So what's happened? The first thing to note is that this is not a new phenomenon. Life has been getting tougher for labour for decades, with the real break coming in the 1980s. Over the past 35 years there has been a marked shift from wages to profits in the UK economy, with labour's share of national income falling from 59% in 1977 to 53% in 2008 and the share of profits up from 25% to 29% over the same period. Over the same period, median earnings failed to keep pace with growth in the economy as measured by gross domestic product. Had they done so, median earnings for full-time workers would be \u00a37,000 a year higher than they are. Two separate factors are involved here: labour has got a smaller share of the national cake, and the distribution of earnings has become more unequal. These figures are contained in a paper by Howard Reed and Jacob Mohun Himmelweit, which will be published soon by the TUC as part of its Touchstone Extra series. In the past explanations for the falling share of wages in national income has been attributed to a combination of technological change, globalisation and the reduced bargaining power of trade unions. Reed and Himmelweit say there is a fourth factor: the increased financialisation of the economy. Their analysis shows that over the past three decades the whole of the increase in the profit share can been attributed to the increased profitability of the financial sector. \"Firms are increasingly able to invest in financial assets as an alternative to direct investment in productive capital (ie, plant and machinery) and they are also able to invest abroad instead of at home,\" the paper says. It adds that financialisation has also empowered shareholders to put constraints on companies designed to make life tougher for labour. This has been especially marked in the case of private equity deals where companies are loaded with debt and under pressure to cut costs aggressively. The rationale for a rising profit share is that it leads to higher investment, which in turn leads to stronger growth and rising employment. Workers gain in the end because companies expand and become more productive. The supply-side reforms of the 1980s were in part based on the theory that the wage share in the 1970s was too high, leading to low levels of investment. There is, however, no evidence that the squeeze on labour's share of national income has led to higher investment. While the profit share rose from 25% to 30% of GDP between 1980 and 2010, investment fell from 20% to 15% and is still falling. It is a similar picture for spending on business research development, which has been dropping steadily since the mid-1980s. What appears to have happened is that the rising profit share went to the financial sector and has been used to boost City pay and bonuses rather than used for new investment. In the bracing climate, few groups of workers are able to garner the full fruits of their labour: Premier League footballers are one, investment bankers another. A number of conclusions can be drawn from this analysis. The first is that the task of rebalancing the economy may be even more daunting than first thought. If the financial sector is responsible for the entire increase in the profit share over the past three decades, that shows how dependent the economy has become on the City as a source of growth. The second conclusion is that the 30-year experiment with supply-side economics has failed to deliver the results in terms of higher investment. That supports those who argue that the UK \u2013 if it is serious about rebalancing \u2013 needs a national investment bank to provide the sort of support provided for business in other developed nations. Finally, investment might be higher if the wage share started to increase. At present, there is little real incentive for businesses to invest. Labour is cheap, finance is difficult and expensive to obtain from the banks, and demand is weak. A rising share of wages in national income would lead to stronger demand. Reed and Himmelweit say this could be achieved either by reform of the financial sector so it has a less pivotal role in the economy, a full-blooded campaign to raise skill levels or reforms to wage bargaining. A rising share of wages in national income would require either a prolonged period of full employment or a rethink of UK economic policy making over the past 30 years. Neither looks remotely probable.",

      "bodyText": "Anti-smoking campaigners have expressed alarm that \"big tobacco\" has been employing two of the world's most powerful lobbying companies in a bid to stymie the introduction of plain packaging for cigarettes. Crosby Textor, which has been hired by the Conservative party to provide \"strategic direction\" at the next election, has played a powerful behind-the-scenes role in mobilising opposition to the Australian government's plans for plain packaging, which became law on Saturday. Tobacco giants fear that the landmark law, which they tried to thwart by funnelling millions of pounds into an array of front groups purportedly representing small shopkeepers, will be copied around the world. The UK government has concluded a consultation on the issue and will report next year. Many other countries are studying Australia's decision closely. News that Lynton Crosby, described as the \"master of the dark political arts\" and \"Australia's Karl Rove\", is to become the Tories' election mastermind triggered concerns from campaigners. \"It's very alarming that Mr Crosby now has the ear of the prime minister while the government is still trying to make its mind up whether to bring in such a law,\" said Deborah Arnott, head of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). While Crosby was federal director of the Liberals in Australia, the party accepted substantial donations from the tobacco lobby. Crosby Textor's co-founder, Mark Textor, has been an adviser to the tobacco industry in Australia, fighting plain packaging. His clients have included Philip Morris, the owner of the Marlboro brand. His company, which has opened an office in London, Crosby Textor Fullbrook (CTF), has been on retainer for tobacco firms since the 1980s. CTF has also represented British American Tobacco. Mark Fullbrook, CTF's co-founder, was also head of campaigning for the Tories. It has emerged that Luther Pendragon, a major UK lobbying and PR firm whose clients include McDonald's and Exxon Mobil, has been quietly lobbying against plain packaging on behalf of Philip Morris. The firm has been contacting trading standards officers around the country, warning them that plain packaging \"will lead to a significant increase in counterfeiting and so will harm the sales of legitimate retailers\". An email from a Luther Pendragon lobbyist to trading standards teams, obtained by the Observer, says: \"We aren't against their objective, but don't think this will achieve their aims.\" A related briefing document produced by Philip Morris makes a series of unsubstantiated claims about plain packaging, warning that the \"government risks creating the perfect storm for black market expansion\", that jobs will be lost and \"that there is no evidence that the move will reduce youth smoking. In fact, it might actually make the situation worse\". Ash said it was writing to a number of health organisations that have used Luther Pendragon, including St George's Healthcare NHS Trust and NHS Skills for Health, suggesting that they may want to think again before using a firm that promotes the interest of cigarette companies. \"Any of the many health organisations that have used Luther Pendragon in the past should think carefully about whether to do so in the future,\" Arnott said. \"Do they really want the services of a company that is happy to profit from protecting cigarette sales and fighting efforts to cut the toll of death and disease caused by smoking?\" The lobbying firms' claims about counterfeiting have been roundly rejected by the Trading Standards Institute, which claims that tobacco products are already easy to counterfeit and that it is not convinced by arguments that suggest the introduction of plain packaging will lead to an increase in counterfeiting. It also claims that covert safety markings will be used in standardised packaging that will help authorities to distinguish them from counterfeits. Luther Pendragon's Brussels office has also been working for the European Retailers and Tobacconists Association. In an email sent to dozens of Brussels-based EU affairs journalists, it promoted a day of action by tobacco retailers in several EU countries, offering to arrange interviews for journalists and providing pictures to illustrate their articles. \"The tobacco industry has poured millions into the campaign to try to stop plain, standardised packaging, first in Australia, where they failed, and now here in the UK,\" Arnott said. \"That's because the industry is terrified that standardised packaging will hit their sales.\" Luther Pendragon did not return requests for comment. CTF declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "The last time erstwhile HBOS boss Andy Hornby appeared in front of MPs with his old chairman Lord Stevenson, all did not end well for Hornby's predecessor Sir James Crosby. The knight had to resign from the Financial Services Authority's board after his clueless old colleagues were savaged by the Treasury select committee in 2009. The key turned out to be testimony supplied by HBOS whistleblower Paul Moore \u2013 whom Crosby had allegedly fired, seemingly for saying HBOS's model was too risky.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A man's word is supposed to be his bond. When it comes to George Osborne, a chancellor's word is \u2013 well, his word. After presiding over one of the most lamentable economic strategies of any post-war Conservative chancellor \u2013 even Black Wednesday had the advantage of leading to an economic recovery \u2013 George Osborne has just given us another example of how his word can only be trusted up to a point. I refer, of course, to the announcement that the next governor of the Bank of England is to be Mark Carney, at present governor of the Bank of Canada. Just as Osborne's deficit reduction strategy was to have produced a sizeable economic recovery \u2013 always a delusion, but we had the chancellor's word for it \u2013 now, in desperation, he has gone back on his word about the promised arrangements for appointing a governor of the Bank of England. In opposition and in government, Osborne made a huge fuss about his brilliant idea that future governors would be appointed for one eight-year term. This would, we were told, be a clever way of avoiding all the inevitable speculation that occurs about whether or not governors serving a five-year term will have their contracts renewed. He also took up the suggestion from his Labour predecessor, Alistair Darling, that, to avoid cronyism, the job should be advertised and those fancying their chances should have to apply. It was not a great idea to ask people to apply, because at that level there was an obvious danger that some good candidates might not wish to expose themselves to the public humiliation of not getting the job. But the eight-year term always struck me as a bad idea too, because the traditional practice gave ministers the opportunity to rid themselves of turbulent governors, especially if there had been a change of government. In appointing Carney, Osborne has gone back on both of his commitments. Carney's initial denials of interest in the job were not, as has been reported in some places, what Winston Churchill (a former chancellor) called \"terminological inexactitudes\", or plain lies. He did not apply. Indeed, he had to be wooed by a star-struck chancellor. In addition, not to put too fine a point upon it, he had to be bribed. Yes, at a time of a policy of planned penury for the poorest in our society, including shameful cuts in welfare benefits, causing misery for hundreds of thousands of citizens, the salary of the governor of the Bank of England will go up by more than 50% next July, and be accompanied by pension contributions and \"relocation and housing expenses\". There seems to be little question of Carney's ability, although, as usual, much of the comment has been well over the top. As Jeremy Paxman said on Newsnight when the editor of the Economist (a friend of Carney's) was lauding the Canadian, \"you'll be telling me he walks on water next\". Carney's initial reaction was, according to the Financial Times, negative. He \"told UK officials he did not want the strings attached to the job: a central bank with an economy in severe difficulties, a salary much lower than he liked, the need to move his wife and four daughters to Britain, and the prospect of serving an eight-year term\". Well, it has to be said that, if nothing else, Carney, who will serve for five years, is a formidable negotiator. Osborne has proved to be putty in his hands. And we have it on the authority of Mrs Carney in the Canadian press that Carney only accepted the job because an opening in Canadian politics has disappeared for the time being. At all events, we are back to the old days of appointments not applications, and a lot of distinguished candidates have been the victims of what became a complete charade. The chancellor's mind had already been made up. In announcing the appointment, Osborne looked like the cat who got the cream. But if he is still at the Treasury when Carney arrives next July \u2013 and a Macmillan-style prime minister would by now have given him the sack for his abject failure to \"deliver\" \u2013 Osborne may be in for a nasty shock. Our chancellor seems to think that Canada is a glowing example of \"expansionary fiscal contraction\" \u2013 that is, of emerging from depression and securing a good rate of economic growth by cutting the budget deficit and imposing austerity on those who are most certainly not \"in this together\". He cites the experience of Canada in the 1990s \u2013 failing to appreciate that it was rapid growth, fuelled by a devaluation and a boom in trade with the US, that induced the Canadian recovery, a recovery which enabled the deficit to be reduced with little pain. Well, as the autumn statement and the latest report from the Office for Budget Responsibility will demonstrate once again on Wednesday, Osborne's policy is hurting but it isn't working. And how! Carney, if he is as good as people say he is, must know this. Indeed, as noted above, when first approached he did not wish to have any truck \"with an economy in severe difficulties\" \u2013 namely the UK. He has contrived to be bribed into changing his mind. He apparently relishes the challenge of restoring supervision to the Bank of England and repairing the banking system. But if he has any sense he will take one look at the policies his chancellor is conducting, and become as difficult as many a governor before him.",

      "body": "<p>Tesco boss Philip Clarke will probably have reason to be grateful to George Osborne come Wednesday. The retailer which could once do no wrong will unveil its last trading statement before Christmas on the same day as the chancellor's autumn statement and will likely benefit from something of a \"Jo Moore moment\" \u2013 it will be a good day to bury bad news.</p> <p>Tesco has had a torrid year. Twelve months ago the wheels came off the once unstoppable juggernaut. It was walloped by rivals over Christmas 2011 and Clarke was forced to issue the retailer's first profit warning in more than 20 years. The shares slumped from 411p to 312p in the space of a couple of weeks and have gone nowhere since. On Friday they closed at 325p \u2013 not good when they were changing hands at 488p five years ago.</p> <p>This year Clarke has been going back to basics \u2013 he calls it his Build a Better Tesco plan and it will cost \u00a31bn \u2013 with more staff, better ranges, smarter stores and a complete rethink of longer-term strategy which will mean far fewer vast out-of-town stores.</p> <p>But analysts reckon that this week's numbers will still be bad. Expect like-for-like UK sales to be flat at best, or down by about 1%. Compare that with Sainsbury's 1.7% increase. Rival grocers are still miles behind the mighty Tesco, but Sainsbury is sitting on its biggest share of the \u00a3160bn annual grocery market for a decade.</p> <p>Analysts point out that the Tesco update will not reveal how much of their sales have been \"bought\" \u2013 ie, are the result only of expensive promotions which reduce profit margins. But Clarke &amp; co have already warned that profit margins will be down about 1%.</p> <p>However, despite the promotions \u2013 more than 40% of the groceries going through the tills are now on special offer, up from about 20% five years ago \u2013 Tesco is no longer perceived by consumers as offering the best value.</p> <p>Another huge problem is the performance of the non-food ranges. Just a couple of years ago Tesco's vast fashion and homeware ranges, which generate higher profit margins than food and could be displayed in the massive Extra hypermarkets, were regarded as the jewel in Tesco's crown. No longer. Such purchases have been hit by the squeeze on shoppers and are rapidly shifting online. Clarke knows it. Apps rather than out-of-town sheds, he acknowledged recently, \"are the new high street\". Amazon is now its biggest rival for those goods.</p> <p>But his problems are not just in the UK stores. The drive for a full-scale Tesco bank to challenge the established operators is moving at snail's pace. And the international division is far from running on rails. Sales growth has faded in key central European markets. The huge Korean business has been hit by new restrictions on trading hours; sales there could be down 8% and \u00a3100m will be wiped off profits. China and Poland are also delivering less than expected.</p> <p>The US operation, Fresh &amp; Easy, is another major headache. It is five years since the first store opened in Hemet, east of Los Angeles. The idea was to build a business the same size as Tesco UK and it seemed success was a slam dunk. Top Tesco operatives had spent two years researching Californian consumers, living in their homes, even looking in their cupboards.</p> <p>Except that it wasn't. Almost everything about Fresh &amp; Easy has been changed, from the look of the stores, to the pack sizes, ranges and self-serve checkouts. The venture has so far eaten through about \u00a31bn. Less than a third of the outlets make a positive contribution to the bottom line. Clarke has cut back the number of F&amp;E store openings and has declared that: \"We need more from Fresh &amp; Easy.\" Indeed he does. Analysts at Panmure Gordon reckon that if the US business was sold or closed down Tesco shares would rocket.</p> <p>This Christmas will be crucial for Clarke. He has to show progress and has to be brave \u2013 even if that means pulling down the shutters in California. Or he will find his own future is doubt.</p> <h2>Banks must knuckle down and raise capital<br></h2> <p>The Bank of England's financial policy committee has issued numerous recommendations since being established in February 2011. There has been a consistent theme throughout: UK banks need more capital. Note the rising urgency in governor Sir Mervyn King's remarks. In June 2011, he said: \"There is a strong case for banks to build up their capital levels further when the opportunity arises.\" In December last year: \"It is sensible and desirable to raise capital buffers further in order to improve resilience in light of the continuing threats to UK financial stability.\" And in June this year: \"There is a need for banks temporarily to raise their levels of capital in view of the exceptional threats they currently face.\"</p> <p><a href=\"www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/29/bank-of-england-financial-system-needs-more-capital\" title=\"\">Thursday's warning was the starkest yet</a>. King said there were three reasons to fear capital levels may be overstated. Future losses may be underestimated; the cost of scandals such as payment protection insurance may not be fully recognised; and risk assessments of loans may be too optimistic.</p> <p>So how big is the shortfall? \u00a310bn? \u00a350bn? More? There was no clear answer. It could be \"very misleading\" to give a single number, explained King, while adding that the figure would be \"material in aggregate\", though \"manageable.\"As it happens, one can comb through the financial stability report and arrive at a figure of up to \u00a360bn: \u00a315bn for cases where the borrower is struggling but the bank is practising forbearance; \u00a310bn for more PPI and Libor claims; and a cool \u00a335bn in the contentious area of what risk weights should be attached to loans.</p> <p>But are these solid estimates or fingers in the air? \"I wouldn't take any of those numbers too literally,\" said Andrew Haldane, a member of the committee, when pressed on risk weights.</p> <p>Is this vagueness deliberate? Only if you believe the Financial Services Authority is on the brink of cracking the problem. Maybe it is: for the first time, King is talking about banks having to report to investors on what actions they propose regarding capital.</p> <p>All the same, it's amazing that we've had almost two years of earnest debate about the difficulties posed by modern accounting techniques, (for example, the disappearance of general provisions for losses that are expected to occur but can't be specifically identified) yet so little capital-raising has actually happened.</p> <p>Setting capital levels is not a parlour game with no consequences for the real economy. King has been plain that more capital and more lending go together. Banks must get on with it.</p> <h2>Tucker set for new pastures?<br></h2> <p>The usually affable Paul Tucker is finding it difficult to hide his dismay at being passed over as the next governor of the Bank of England. Asked about it last week at a somewhat difficult press conference, the deputy governor merely repeated that he still had a \"job of work\" and intended to get on with it, before the Bank's head of communications stepped in hastily to move things on.</p> <p>Such surliness will only fuel speculation that the Bank of England lifer will want to move on. Matchmakers are already pointing out that Tucker could make a neat fit for Lloyds Banking Group when Sir Win Bischoff retires as chairman. Others reckon he will finally get his hands on the big prize in five years, when Carney intends to return to his native Canada. That is certainly the view of his friend, the Kingfisher chief executive Ian Cheshire, <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/money/4673113/Sir-Mervyn-King-Big-five-banks-need-35bn-disaster-funds.html\" title=\"\">who told the <em>Sun</em> last week</a>: \"He's a very good guy and ought to be considered in five years\". Still, no reason not to try pastures new in the meantime.</p>",

The shares slumped from 411p to 312p in the space of a couple of weeks and have gone nowhere since. On Friday they closed at 325p \u2013 not good when they were changing hands at 488p five years ago. This year Clarke has been going back to basics \u2013 he calls it his Build a Better Tesco plan and it will cost \u00a31bn \u2013 with more staff, better ranges, smarter stores and a complete rethink of longer-term strategy which will mean far fewer vast out-of-town stores. But analysts reckon that this week's numbers will still be bad. Expect like-for-like UK sales to be flat at best, or down by about 1%. Compare that with Sainsbury's 1.7% increase. Rival grocers are still miles behind the mighty Tesco, but Sainsbury is sitting on its biggest share of the \u00a3160bn annual grocery market for a decade. Analysts point out that the Tesco update will not reveal how much of their sales have been \"bought\" \u2013 ie, are the result only of expensive promotions which reduce profit margins. But Clarke &amp; co have already warned that profit margins will be down about 1%. However, despite the promotions \u2013 more than 40% of the groceries going through the tills are now on special offer, up from about 20% five years ago \u2013 Tesco is no longer perceived by consumers as offering the best value. Another huge problem is the performance of the non-food ranges. Just a couple of years ago Tesco's vast fashion and homeware ranges, which generate higher profit margins than food and could be displayed in the massive Extra hypermarkets, were regarded as the jewel in Tesco's crown. No longer. Such purchases have been hit by the squeeze on shoppers and are rapidly shifting online. Clarke knows it. Apps rather than out-of-town sheds, he acknowledged recently, \"are the new high street\". Amazon is now its biggest rival for those goods. But his problems are not just in the UK stores. The drive for a full-scale Tesco bank to challenge the established operators is moving at snail's pace. And the international division is far from running on rails. Sales growth has faded in key central European markets. The huge Korean business has been hit by new restrictions on trading hours; sales there could be down 8% and \u00a3100m will be wiped off profits. China and Poland are also delivering less than expected. The US operation, Fresh &amp; Easy, is another major headache. It is five years since the first store opened in Hemet, east of Los Angeles. The idea was to build a business the same size as Tesco UK and it seemed success was a slam dunk. Top Tesco operatives had spent two years researching Californian consumers, living in their homes, even looking in their cupboards. Except that it wasn't. Almost everything about Fresh &amp; Easy has been changed, from the look of the stores, to the pack sizes, ranges and self-serve checkouts. The venture has so far eaten through about \u00a31bn. Less than a third of the outlets make a positive contribution to the bottom line. Clarke has cut back the number of F&amp;E store openings and has declared that: \"We need more from Fresh &amp; Easy.\" Indeed he does. Analysts at Panmure Gordon reckon that if the US business was sold or closed down Tesco shares would rocket. This Christmas will be crucial for Clarke. He has to show progress and has to be brave \u2013 even if that means pulling down the shutters in California. Or he will find his own future is doubt. Banks must knuckle down and raise capital The Bank of England's financial policy committee has issued numerous recommendations since being established in February 2011. There has been a consistent theme throughout: UK banks need more capital. Note the rising urgency in governor Sir Mervyn King's remarks. In June 2011, he said: \"There is a strong case for banks to build up their capital levels further when the opportunity arises.\" In December last year: \"It is sensible and desirable to raise capital buffers further in order to improve resilience in light of the continuing threats to UK financial stability.\" And in June this year: \"There is a need for banks temporarily to raise their levels of capital in view of the exceptional threats they currently face.\" Thursday's warning was the starkest yet. King said there were three reasons to fear capital levels may be overstated. Future losses may be underestimated; the cost of scandals such as payment protection insurance may not be fully recognised; and risk assessments of loans may be too optimistic. So how big is the shortfall? \u00a310bn? \u00a350bn? More? There was no clear answer. It could be \"very misleading\" to give a single number, explained King, while adding that the figure would be \"material in aggregate\", though \"manageable.\"As it happens, one can comb through the financial stability report and arrive at a figure of up to \u00a360bn: \u00a315bn for cases where the borrower is struggling but the bank is practising forbearance; \u00a310bn for more PPI and Libor claims; and a cool \u00a335bn in the contentious area of what risk weights should be attached to loans. But are these solid estimates or fingers in the air? \"I wouldn't take any of those numbers too literally,\" said Andrew Haldane, a member of the committee, when pressed on risk weights. Is this vagueness deliberate? Only if you believe the Financial Services Authority is on the brink of cracking the problem. Maybe it is: for the first time, King is talking about banks having to report to investors on what actions they propose regarding capital. All the same, it's amazing that we've had almost two years of earnest debate about the difficulties posed by modern accounting techniques, (for example, the disappearance of general provisions for losses that are expected to occur but can't be specifically identified) yet so little capital-raising has actually happened. Setting capital levels is not a parlour game with no consequences for the real economy. King has been plain that more capital and more lending go together. Banks must get on with it. Tucker set for new pastures? The usually affable Paul Tucker is finding it difficult to hide his dismay at being passed over as the next governor of the Bank of England. Asked about it last week at a somewhat difficult press conference, the deputy governor merely repeated that he still had a \"job of work\" and intended to get on with it, before the Bank's head of communications stepped in hastily to move things on. Such surliness will only fuel speculation that the Bank of England lifer will want to move on. Matchmakers are already pointing out that Tucker could make a neat fit for Lloyds Banking Group when Sir Win Bischoff retires as chairman. Others reckon he will finally get his hands on the big prize in five years, when Carney intends to return to his native Canada. That is certainly the view of his friend, the Kingfisher chief executive Ian Cheshire, who told the Sun last week: \"He's a very good guy and ought to be considered in five years\". Still, no reason not to try pastures new in the meantime.",
