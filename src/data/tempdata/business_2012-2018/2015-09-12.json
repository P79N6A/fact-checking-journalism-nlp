      "bodyText": "Vodafone Australia has admitted an employee hacked a journalist\u2019s phone records in an attempt to uncover her sources for stories, but the telecommunications company denies any \u201cimproper behaviour\u201d, despite internal emails suggesting it deliberately misled authorities about systemic privacy breaches. In 2011, after a series of stories by Fairfax journalist Natalie O\u2019Brien detailing grave security lapses in Vodafone\u2019s Siebel data system, a Vodafone employee accessed her phone call and text message records in an attempt to uncover company whistleblowers. O\u2019Brien \u2013 herself a Vodafone customer \u2013 reported that Vodafone\u2019s Siebel data system was vulnerable to hacking, and that the data of millions of customers was available online and easily accessible through generic passwords that were being shared around the company and publicly. Customers\u2019 home addresses, driver\u2019s licences and credit card details were all available online, O\u2019Brien wrote, and criminal groups were paying for customers\u2019 private information. The day after the story broke, a Vodafone employee accessed O\u2019Brien phone records and trawled through the data in order to find out who might have been leaking her information. Writing in the Sun-Herald, O\u2019Brien said she had been devastated by the invasion of privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s a creepy nauseating experience to know that someone has been trawling through your mobile phone account looking at all your call records and private text messages. \u201cThe invasion of privacy is devasting. It plays with your mind. What was in those texts? Who were they to? What did they see? What did they do with the information?\u201d She said the stories she wrote were \u201cin the public interest\u201d, and the vulnerability in Vodafone\u2019s system serious enough that both the Information and Privacy Commissioner and the Australian Communications and Media Authority launched independent investigations. \u201cThe shock and anger is only compounded knowing it was because I was doing my job that I was targeted and it was my own telco that was doing it to me. Since when did telling the truth become the wrong thing to do?\u201d An internal Vodafone email, reported by the Australian, shows the company was aware of the extent of the security breaches and the potential legal and reputation damage of hacking a journalist\u2019s phone. The head of fraud management and investigations for Vodafone Group, Colin Yates, wrote to then global corporate security director Richard Knowlton that there was a \u201chuge risk\u201d to the company if the hacking of O\u2019Brien\u2019s phone \u201cgets into the public domain\u201d. \u201cIf the issue relating to breaching the reporter\u2019s privacy by searching her private call records and text messages gets into the public domain, this could have serious consequences given it is a breach of the Australian Telecommunications Act,\u201d Yates wrote. \u201cAnd would certainly destroy all of the work done by VHA [Vodafone Hutchison Australia] over the past months to try and restore their reputation.\u201d The Yates email also suggests the company covered up the extent of the Siebel security breaches from the public and industry regulators. Following the series of stories, Vodafone executives allegedly \u201ctold the press, the NSW Privacy Commissioner and other high-profile Australian agencies that the breach was a one-off incident\u201d, Yates wrote to Knowlton. \u201cAs you know this is in fact not the case and VHA has been suffering these breaches since Siebel went live and did nothing or very little to close off the weaknesses that allowed them to occur.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, a Vodafone spokeswoman said the company \u201cstrongly denies any allegations of improper behaviour.

      "bodyText": "A quarter of a century ago, it was given up for dead. Triumph, a much-loved British manufacturing brand that began life in the 19th century, seemed to be heading for the scrapheap, another motorbike maker destined to go the way of so many motorcycle marques. The company that built the machines on which a leather-clad Marlon Brando smouldered in The Wild One and on which Steve McQueen sought to escape the Nazis in The Great Escape was forced to close its doors, unable to compete against an invasion of faster, technologically more advanced bikes from Japan. Fast-forward 25 years and today Triumph has a future firmly rooted in its past \u2013 thanks in no small part to consumers\u2019 never-ending nostalgia for the Britain of the Swinging Sixties. The Triumph brand has become synonymous with cool, something that has helped it achieve a near Lazarus-like revival. Last year Triumph sold 54,500 motorbikes \u2013 close to its peak in the 60s. It operates in 57 countries and over the last 12 months in the UK sold more large motorbikes \u2013 those above 500cc \u2013 than any of its rivals. Dealers say a second-hand Triumph can cost nearly as much as a brand-new one because demand for some of its models, notably its retro bikes such as the Bonneville, are so strong. \u201cBiking per se is cool,\u201d said Paul Stroud, Triumph\u2019s sales and marketing director. \u201cIt has been since Marlon Brando and The Wild One. The Triumph brand\u2019s heritage makes it attractive.\u201d Mining the 60s for inspiration is a tried and tested route for many vehicle manufacturers. BMW brought back a remodelled Mini, Fiat a Cinquecento. \u201cThe retro chic of the 60s has never been away,\u201d suggested Ellis Cashmore, visiting professor of sociology at Aston University and author of the book Celebrity Culture. \u201cThere\u2019s always been this deference to the 60s \u2013 the decade of release, when everything changed. It was the first decade when the young asserted themselves. It is by far the most iconic decade.\u201d Triumph was admired by the likes of Bob Dylan, and no less a style icon than David Beckham is now regularly photographed riding his customised Triumph Bonneville. Indeed the machines are appearing with such extraordinary regularity on both the small and large screens that there is a suspicion the company must be spending a fortune to make sure its products are seen. Triumph bikes have appeared in Luther and Hannibal; they feature in next year\u2019s BBC spy thriller The Night Manager, and the forthcoming blockbuster London Has Fallen, starring Gerard Butler. In the new series of Doctor Who, Clara, the doctor\u2019s assistant, will ride a Bonneville Scrambler. The actor Chris Pratt rode the same machine in Jurassic World, sparking a 100% increase in internet searches for the bike and doubling bookings for test rides. Such product placement would normally cost millions of pounds. But Triumph is unusual. While it employs an agency to make production companies aware that its bikes are available for use, it has never paid for its machines to feature in films or for celebrity endorsement. \u201cWe\u2019re not really into marketing and advertising to the masses,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve paid to put it there, then that\u2019s pretty clear. The bigger the film the odder it looks.\u201d It was an approach that worked for the company in the past. \u201cSteve McQueen wasn\u2019t paid to ride Triumphs,\u201d Stroud explained. \u201cHe just wanted to ride the best thing you could buy. That\u2019s our ambition. We are delighted that David Beckham is a fan of the brand and chooses to ride Triumph. We are incredibly pleased that he chose to ride one of our bikes in the BBC documentary Into the Unknown.\u201d Not since Charlie Boorman and Ewan McGregor popularised BMW\u2019s all-terrain adventure bikes in their series, Long Way Round, has a motorcycle brand received such high-profile support. \u201cHaving Beckham seen on your motorbike is similar to having Madonna drink Timothy Taylor\u2019s,\u201d Cashmore said. After the singer declared a love of the real ale brand, sales soared. But Triumph is painfully aware how fickle success can be. In 1967 Evel Knievel attempted to jump the fountain at Caesar\u2019s Palace casino in Las Vegas on a Bonneville. Just 15 years later, Triumph\u2019s Meriden factory in the West Midlands closed its doors. Today, having resumed production in 1990, it employs 2,000 people and has five factories spread across the UK and Thailand, as well as assembly plants in India and Brazil. The risk for the company now is that it could become a victim of its own success. Aware of the retro trend, BMW has brought out the R nineT, Ducati its Scrambler, Yamaha the XSR700, and Kawasaki the W800. Cultural commentators have suggested that the emergence of the \u201cclassic\u201d bike market has given the industry a new affinity with the fashion world, taking it back to the heyday of Brando and McQueen and beyond its association with motor racing that has seen enthusiasts spend a small fortune kitting themselves out to look the part. \u201cYou can drive around in cool leather jackets instead of full leather outfits,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cThe whole association with fashion and bikes is back in again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As he gazes across the Commons to a new shadow cabinet, George Osborne will doubtless be prouder than ever of the long-term economic plan that helped his party stampede to victory in May. For a chancellor who never tires of saying that his stewardship of the UK economy has made it among the best performing of the developed world, now more than ever he will want to paint himself as a safe pair of hands. But Osborne can\u2019t expect an easy ride: he has a bumper in-tray and economic threats from home and abroad. Here are his six big challenges: Spending review Osborne will face growing criticism as he seeks to impose yet more austerity. He has been collecting ideas from government departments about how they might slash up to 40% more from their budgets by 2019-20, and will reveal where the axe will fall in his spending review on 25 November. His call for the state to \u201cdeliver more with less\u201d and save an additional \u00a320bn in public spending comes on top of measures in July\u2019s budget for \u00a312bn of savings from welfare and \u00a35bn from tax changes. Rankled retailers It is not just civil servants who are feeling hard done by. Osborne is on a collision course with the retail sector thanks to his plans to hike business rates and increase the minimum wage. The chancellor used his summer budget to unveil a \u201cnational living wage\u201d \u2013 a 50p increase in the statutory minimum pay rate for over-25s from April, to \u00a37.20 an hour, followed by a series of stepped increases expected to take the rate above \u00a39 an hour by 2020. But businesses are already warning they might have to cut jobs and raise prices as a result. Retailer Next and Whitbread, owner of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, have been among those complaining of their higher labour costs. High street stores and supermarkets are also anxious about business rates rising over coming years. The rates are hated by many small high street businesses, and Osborne is under pressure to shake up the system. A review is due before next year\u2019s budget. Economic wobble The coming months may well challenge Osborne\u2019s claim that his plan is working. Latest indicators suggest 2015 could be a year of two halves: momentum has been seeping out of the economy since July. Sharp falls in exports and manufacturing output last week offered the first evidence that the global slowdown may be taking its toll \u2013 bad news for a chancellor who espoused a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d to rebalance the economy away from its over-reliance on consumer spending. Martin Beck of Oxford Economics commented: \u201cWith growth in the third quarter likely to be wholly reliant on services, the goal of a better-balanced economy looks an ever-more-distant prospect.\u201d Among other domestic challenges, Osborne must prove that his Northern Powerhouse plan is more than just a catchy name, and that he is serious about the UK\u2019s woeful productivity. And with crude prices tumbling, Osborne may be called on to find more ways to help North Sea oil producers. One area beyond Osborne\u2019s control but bound to ruffle business and household feathers alike is interest rates. After more than six years of borrowing costs at a record low, the Bank of England is telling borrowers to prepare for a hike. Global headwinds The Bank of England highlighted the \u201cglobal headwinds\u201d facing the UK as it unveiled its decision to keep interest rates on hold last week. China\u2019s downturn has sent shockwaves through global markets and been felt in the real economy too thanks to waning demand for all manner of goods and services and big swings in commodity prices. Closer to home, the Greek problem has not gone away. It remains to be seen whether, after elections next week, a new government will push through the reforms international creditors have demanded. That leaves lingering fears over the prospects for exports to our key trading partner, the eurozone. Brexit The planned referendum on whether the UK should stay in the EU is another potential flashpoint between the Conservative government and business. Big employer associations such as the CBI have repeatedly called for the UK to remain in a \u201creformed EU\u201d. Osborne will want to convince them his government is getting the changes they want in Brussels in return for the hit to confidence they say they will suffer as a result of the referendum. Banks Osborne\u2019s plan for an eight-percentage-point corporation tax surcharge from next year is infuriating \u201cchallenger banks\u201d such as Metro and Secure Trust, which are trying to break the stranglehold of the big four on the high street. The surcharge is being introduced just as the bank levy \u2013 based on a bank\u2019s balance sheet rather than its profits \u2013 is being watered down, in a move that helps large banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered.",
