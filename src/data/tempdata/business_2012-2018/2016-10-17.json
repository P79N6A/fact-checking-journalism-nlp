      "bodyText": "Britain can jettison hundreds of costly agricultural regulations which have pushed up food prices, offsetting the extra costs of European Union tariffs, according to a report by a free market thinktank. A study by the Institute of Economic Affairs argues that Brussels has fallen victim to intense lobbying by pressure groups which benefit from tighter rules on food standards, animal welfare and the environment. These rules often have little benefit for consumer health or reduce risks, but \u201ccreate deadweight costs\u201d, it said. The IEA said banning all synthetic pesticides currently allowed under the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) could add as much as \u00a37.5bn to the cost of food production should the UK remain within the EU. Behind the calculation is a move towards imposing organic standards on farmers, the report said, which would lower crop yields. If all food were grown organically, it said wheat yields would halve, leading to a price rise of nearly 70%, potato yields would fall by 44% leading to a price increase of nearly 200%, and bean yields would fall by a quarter, leading to a price rise of more than 50%. The report attacks Friends of the Earth and farmers\u2019 unions for persuading EU officials to widen the remit of the CAP to include regulation of food production. It said the CAP had evolved into an \u201cinterventionist\u201d and complex bureaucracy with \u201ca remit that covers a multitude of areas, from biodiversity to food safety to environmental protection, all of which have led to a huge regulatory burden on the food industry\u201d. Mark Littlewood, the IEA\u2019s director general, said he was concerned that official figures showed existing agricultural regulations were already costing nearly \u00a3600m every year in England. \u201cEU member states face staggering food price rises unless the march of increased regulation is halted. The UK is fortunate that it now has the opportunity to repatriate control of its farming regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that decisions stem from good scientific evidence, and pay attention to consumers\u2019 interests and the potential crippling costs that overregulation can have in pushing up food prices and the cost of living.\u201d The report said consumers should be allowed to buy cheaper food, including genetically modified products, without the intervention of Brussels officials \u201ccaptured\u201d by special interest groups. It added: \u201cSince the 1990s, the growth of regulation and subsidies has gone hand-in-hand as subsidies have been increasingly tied to environmental requirements imposed on farmers. This leads to costs for consumers and taxpayers alike. \u201cOne cause of the growth in regulation is the use of the precautionary principle. This is poorly defined. However, in general, it means that the benefit of the doubt is given to the protection against any possible harm at the expense of consumer, business or economic interests. \u201cThe result has been a drift towards overregulation and a jettisoning of rational principles of managing and taking into account risk.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As ever housing affordability remains a hot topic. The latest little spot fire this week came via demographer, Bernard Salt\u2019s venture into a hipster cafe where he saw young people buying a smashed avocado dish for $22 (I know, the shock). He mused \u201chow can young people afford to eat like this? Shouldn\u2019t they be economising by eating at home? How often are they eating out? Twenty-two dollars several times a week could go towards a deposit on a house\u201d. Now look, I could get outraged over this boomer-millennial war, but as a proud member of Gen X, I\u2019d rather both sides shut up and let me listen to Nirvana on Spotify in peace. But if one must take a side, as ever I\u2019ll side with the evidence over the anecdote. Suggesting that seeing a person in their 20s eating a $22 meal is somehow representative of any group is a pretty specious bit of research. Perhaps that person buying the dish already owns a house or apartment, perhaps the avocado lover in question had decided he might as well buy a $22 bit of food given the likelihood of never being able to afford a house, given people over 50 are pushing up the prices as they frantically try to buy an investment property in order to negatively gear it. But when you gotta file some dumb copy to make the yell-at-the-cloud clique smile, I guess you leave the research for the younger, more energetic folk. Thankfully evidence abounds. And as is often the case, a graph showed it quite nicely. Matt Cowgill, an economist and stout defender of the millennial, yesterday tweeted an excellent graph showing that according to the ABS\u2019s household expenditure survey, people in households aged 25-34 actually spend more of their income now on housing than they did in 1989. Not only that, they spend less of their income on food now than they did then. Cowgill showed the data comparison of 1989 and 2010 which is the latest data we have (but the ABS has had regular such surveys going back to 1984). A look at the amount of 25-24 year-olds income spent on housing, food, alcohol and recreation shows that, rather unsurprisingly, the big increase in housing expenditure came in the 2000s with the housing boom: And far from being food gluttons, drunkards or spending all their money on slovenly \u201crecreation\u201d, in all three of those categories 25-34 year-olds spent less of their income than did their counterparts of earlier years. This really should be no surprise to older folk \u2013 that is those now in Generation X (sigh) and above \u2013 because the same spending patterns have happened for them. In 1984 households with the head aged 45-54 spent 7% of their income on housing costs. By 1999 this had risen marginally to 7.9%, but by 2010 it had boomed to 10.5%: Rather unsurprisingly, when housing costs go up for one group, they also go up for others. And anyone arguing that people spend less now on housing expenses than they did in the past has probably eaten a few too many dodgy avocados and best go have a lie down and take a nap. One problem specific to youth now compared to the past is that not only are they in the process of trying to save up for a deposit, they are doing so at a time where rent is more expensive now than it once was. Compare the annual price growth of rents and overall CPI over the past 15 years and again you see that for renters, costs have risen markedly compared to other items. That\u2019s great if you own an investment property and have been negative gearing it like mad; not so good if you are one renting while saving up to buy your first home: What has also changed is the type of property a young person might be able to now buy. In the past, Australia was very much a place where houses were built. But the latest housing boom, since the RBA cut rates in November 2011, has very much been a boom of construction of apartment and flats: And the apartment boom has been most marked in Sydney: Melbourne: And Brisbane: So big has this apartment boom been that the RBA has been worried that a glut of apartments in these cities might occur \u2013 where the supply of apartments outstrips demand and thus the price of the apartments crashes \u2013 or at least falls significantly. In its latest Financial Stability Review released last Friday, the RBA even made special mention of the \u201cBanks\u2019 Exposures to Inner-city Apartment Markets\u201d warning that \u201cthe large number of new apartments recently completed and currently under construction in many capital cities raises the risk of a marked oversupply in some geographic areas\u201d. And certainly the supply continues to come \u2013 with the total value of work on non-housing residential building still to be done now reaching a record $33.6bn: The increase in supply is good for housing affordability \u2013 even if the affordability is likely to be first improved for those buying an apartment rather than a house. But such things filter through the system, and anything that allows younger people to get into the housing market in the first place is generally a good thing. But should a glut occur and a housing market bubble bursts due to the surge of apartments, the flow-on might mean lower house prices, but the overall impact would see the economy as a whole as smashed as a $22 avocado brunch. And you wouldn\u2019t be able to blame the millennials for that.",

Despite the sudden panic about \u201csoaring\u201d gilt yields and thus the rise in the government\u2019s cost of borrowing, the answer is not the UK. It is the US. The question is a slight cheat in the sense that US 10-year Treasury yields have barely budged \u2013 they were 1.74% on referendum day, fell to 1.32% in early July and are now 1.76%. But a comparison with the US makes a useful point. The UK\u2019s journey from 1.37% to 0.5% to 1.11% can be made to resemble a screeching handbrake turn because yields have doubled from their low point. But, viewed in the round, gilt yields haven\u2019t strayed very far from the curve taken by most G7 countries\u2019 bond markets since the summer. Even Germany\u2019s 10-year bund rates, as Oxford Economics points out, are close to their pre-UK referendum levels \u2013 albeit Germany\u2019s cost of borrowing for 10 years is close to zero. The thinktank offers other reasons to be sanguine about gilt yields. For example, the UK\u2019s cost of borrowing is still remarkably low. Over the past 80 years, UK governments have paid an average of 6.4% to borrow for a 10-year period, it calculates. We will discover next month how much chancellor Philip Hammond intends to borrow to spend on infrastructure and suchlike, but it would be amazing if he has altered his plans because of the up-tick in gilt yields in the past three weeks. Indeed, gilts always have to be viewed against the backdrop of inflation expectations. As the pound has fallen, so have investors naturally come to predict a higher rate of inflation in the UK over the next decade. But the government can still borrow well below the expected rate of inflation of 3%. It would be ridiculous, of course, to assume conditions will remain so benign forever. There are dangers from many directions. A further downwards lurch for the pound, an inflation shock (September\u2019s data will be published on Tuesday), or a Brexit-related collapse in business investment could all upset investors\u2019 appetite for gilts. But let\u2019s at least use a sensible definition of what would represent a crisis: a yield of 1.11% is not even close. Poorer Pearson? Pearson is testing the faith of its loyal shareholders. A 13% fall in North American revenues was a scary-looking figure to unveil at the nine-month stage, even if it looks much gentler in sterling terms. Don\u2019t worry, says chief executive John Fallon, there\u2019s an explanation. Bookshops at US university and college campuses have been running down stocks of textbooks to get their inventories under control. When that period passes, Pearson will be seen to have suffered merely a slight hiccup. For the time being, hope is alive \u2013 as are this year\u2019s earnings forecasts. The entire US education market has been moving to digital formats and Pearson has tried to get ahead of the trend by cutting 4,000 jobs, 10% of its workforce. It would not be surprising if campus bookshops have been slower to react and are now adjusting in haste. Yet the nagging doubt is whether the digital drift will leave publishers permanently poorer in a world where students have gained the ability to rent materials, for example. Fallon needs to show that Pearson can still grow sales in the US college market. Judgment day arrives next year. If all goes to plan, operating profits will improve from about \u00a3600m this year to \u00a3800m in 2018. Terrific if it happens because a dividend yielding almost 7% would look considerably safer. Monday\u2019s 8% fall in the share price says the market remains sceptical. Biffa cuts and floats Biffa\u2019s private equity backers were clearly extremely anxious to see the waste management firm floated. They agreed to cut the price of the shares to 180p from a reputed 220p-270p. And, instead of selling a few shares themselves, the owners have ended up increasing their investment. Current shareholders chipped in \u00a350m of the \u00a3262m raised by Biffa. In the shoes of Bain Capital, Angelo Gordon and Avenue Europe, you might be tempted to ask for a refund from your battalion of bankers on the float \u2013 Citi, JP Morgan, HSBC, Peel Hunt and Rothschild. No chance. The prospectus reveals the expected expenses of the offer will be \u00a319.6m \u2013 call it a 9% rake-off from the new shareholders\u2019 \u00a3212m.

      "bodyText": "Dozens of diesel farms stand to win millions of pounds in lucrative contracts to keep the UK\u2019s lights on, sparking anger from environmental groups. National Grid, which operates the UK\u2019s electricity network, said small power generators had bid for 15-year contracts starting in 2020-21, as part of the government\u2019s capacity market reforms. The contracts, for firms that produce below 100MW, will see them paid to be on standby in case of a shortfall from power sources such as coal, gas or wind. Of the total 8.7GW of back-up power that firms have offered, 3.9GW \u2013 more than the generating capacity of the Hinkley Point nuclear power station \u2013 is from generators who say they will burn either gas or diesel. The companies could make up to \u00a3787m between them, depending on how many opt for diesel over gas and how many are successful in the final auction in December. Diesel power firms submitted bids to provide just 0.87GW in last year\u2019s auction, winning about three-quarters of their bids, worth some \u00a3176m. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy said it was unable to provide an exact figure for how much diesel generation had been bid for, although insiders said the true figure could be lower than 3.9GW. But a spokesman said that even though diesel firms could be paid millions to be on standby, they were unlikely to contribute much to pollution because they would only run when there was a heightened risk of power shortages. \u201cDiesel generation accounts for less than 0.1% of total energy generation and will only ever be used for very short periods of time to provide instant electricity when it is needed. \u201cWe are taking action on diesel emissions and all new diesel systems will have to comply with new emission controls,\u201d the spokesman said. A spokesman for climate change campaign group Sandbag said: \u201cWe are surprised and disappointed that so much new diesel could be built. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk we\u2019re sleepwalking into a new generation of polluting diesel farms unless the government gets a grip on this. We need the right type of investment to help modernise our electricity system, and that certainly isn\u2019t diesel. \u201cThe government needs to ensure that the capacity auction is incentivising the right investment, rather than building a nationwide fleet of dirty diesel.\u201d Richard Black, director of thinktank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the government should be doing more to encourage the use of battery storage and demand-side response, where firms agree to reduce or shift their energy usage. \u201cThe capacity market is a necessary tool but it would be very sensible to design it so that it also fits in with the long-term objective of building a smart low-carbon system and fulfilling its aim of the UK becoming a world leader on battery technology,\u201d Black said. \u201cThey\u2019ve missed a trick. They could have rewritten the rules and redesigned the capacity mechanism, they could have differentiated between clean and dirty energy and they chose not to. \u201cIf they\u2019d rewritten the rules to prioritise batteries and demand-side response then we might have more of those technologies available now.\u201d A spokesperson for Greenpeace said: \u201cBritain is one of the world\u2019s leading economies and the idea that in the 21st century we may have to rely on highly polluting diesel farms to keep the lights on is quite embarrassing.\u201d",

Keith Harris Wantage, Oxfordshire \u2022 The notion that alcohol is fattening is raised in your pages (Report, 17 October). By what metabolic pathway is this achieved in the body? The only organisms I know that utilise alcohol are certain bacteria that downgrade it further to vinegar \u2013 acetic acid. It may be that some alcoholic drinks contain sugar too. But it is the sugar that fattens, not the alcohol. Colin Purdom Shotesham St Mary, Norfolk \u2022 I keep hearing that employers value soft skills as much as academic qualifications. It is interesting, then, that women working on the Asda shop floor, where they are likely to encounter customers and require such skills, are being paid less than men well away from the public eye in warehouses (Report, 15 October). If Asda women win their case, maybe this will encourage young people to believe that what they can do, and how they do it, is as important as their exam results. Carole Easton Chief executive, Young Women\u2019s Trust \u2022 If, as claimed in your review of The Book of Human Emotions (Review, 15 October), there exists a condition called \u201cbasorexia, which is a sudden urge to kiss someone\u201d, can we expect it to appear in the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Pfizer to invent a pill for it, and Donald Trump to blame it for his past indiscretions?

      "bodyText": "Another high street retailer could join BHS on the scrapheap after the steepest slump in fashion sales since the financial crisis, a leading retail analysis firm has warned. Kantar Worldpanel said its latest figures showed that shoppers spent \u00a3700m less on clothing, shoes and accessories in the year to 25 September than they did during the previous 12 months. The period ended with four consecutive months of falling sales, the sharpest decline to hit the \u00a336bn UK fashion market since 2009, when the banking crisis ravaged consumer confidence. Kantar said retailers had been hit by a combination of unseasonal weather and fragile consumer confidence caused by economic doom warnings around the Brexit vote. It forecast that retail sales could worsen next year when the closure of BHS, which accounted for about \u00a3400m of annual UK retail sales, is factored in. Kantar said the high street was in such a parlous state that another major retailer could yet follow the department store chain and close. \u201cOnly 10 of our top fashion retailers are worth more than the \u00a3700m which the market has lost, so this decline is equal to one of them disappearing from our high streets,\u201d said Glen Tooke of Kantar. \u201cGiven the events of this summer this [the closure of another retailer] no longer seems impossible.\u201d Kantar said it was not predicting the demise of a household name, but pointed out that conditions have made such an event more probable. Tooke also blamed the sales decline on \u201cdiscount fatigue\u201d \u2013 where by consumers were no longer impressed by sales \u2013 and on changing spending patterns as consumers chose to spend on evenings out instead of clothes. He added that while it was too early to assess the true impact of the EU referendum on retailers, the slump in sterling that followed the June 23 vote means further pain could be ahead. \u201cIf production costs are going up [owing to the weak pound] do you do something to control costs such as decreasing your quality?\u201d said Tooke. \u201cDo you absorb the cost yourself or do you pass it on to your consumers? None of that is an ideal solution. Price increases usually means volume of sales decreasing.\u201d Retailers could be exacerbating weakness in the sector themselves, he said. \u201cRather than chasing after the same \u2018micro trends\u2019 as every one of their competitors, they need to work on understanding what their customers really want and to fulfil their needs. \u201cIt\u2019s more about understanding what customers want rather than seeing a small pocket of the market that\u2019s performing well and going after that. If you do that then everybody chases that one thing and loses their point of difference.\u201d The Kantar figures are drawn from monitoring the spending patterns of 15,000 people and extrapolating them to give a broader picture of national habits. Recent sales figures released by some of the biggest companies in UK fashion retail appear to support Kantar\u2019s gloomy outlook. High street bellwether Next reported a 0.3% increase in sales in the quarter to 30 July but saw profits fall. Its chief executive, Lord Wolfson, warned of tough times for the company and the wider industry. Several of the UK\u2019s other fashion firms have been unable to arrest declining sales. Marks &amp; Spencer had its biggest fall in clothing sales in 10 years earlier this summer, with sales in its fashion and homeware division plunging 8.9%. Primark said last month that sales in the year to mid-September were down 2%. The announcement came just a few months after it reported its first fall in half-year sales for 12 years. Debenhams reported a 0.2% decline in like-for-like sales in the third quarter, blaming shifting spending patterns that saw consumers splash out on holidays and restaurants. Retail sales bounced back in September after a weak August, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). But the industry body also warned of rising prices in shops owing to retailers\u2019 higher import costs as sterling fell amid uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future trade relationship with the European Union. The BRC called on the government to do everything it can to ensure that Brexit does not result in import tariffs being added to clothes arriving from the EU.",

      "bodyText": "Sterling has edged up against the dollar but is still below $1.22 after the speech from US Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fischer. He said \u201ca variety of factors have been holding down interest rates and may continue to do so for some time,\u201d which seems contrary to the idea of an imminent US rate rise. So the pound is currently up 0.07% at $1.2192, while against the euro it is off its worst levels, down 0.19% at \u20ac1.1084. As for bonds, they have also recovered some ground but the 10 year yield at 1.117%, up 0.02 percentage points, is still at its highest since the aftermath of the Brexit vote. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A leading member of the US Federal Reserve has warned of the dangers of continuing low interest rates. Vice chairman Stanley Fischer said in a speech in New York there were three reasons to be concerned about low rates: First, and most worrying, is the possibility that low long-term interest rates are a signal that the economy\u2019s long-run growth prospects are dim...A second concern is that low interest rates make the economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks that can put it in a recession...And the third concern is that low interest rates may also threaten financial stability as some investors reach for yield and compressed net interest margins make it harder for some financial institutions to build up capital buffers... Those are three powerful reasons to prefer interest rates that are higher than current rates. But, of course, Fed interest rates are kept very low at the moment because of the need to maintain aggregate demand at levels that will support the attainment of our dual policy goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, defined as the rate of inflation in the price level of personal consumption expenditures.. being at our target level of 2 percent. He said there were a variety of factors holding down interest rates - including slow economic growth, low investment, a slowdown in the global economy - and they may continue to go so for some time. But he added economic policy could help offset these factors, and boost the economy\u2019s growth potential: While there is disagreement about what the most effective policies would be, some combination of more encouragement for private investment, improved public infrastructure, better education, and more effective regulation is likely to promote faster growth of productivity and living standards--and also to reduce the probability that the economy and, particularly, the central bank will in the future have to contend with the effective lower bound. Over in Greece thousands of leftwing protestors are demonstrating outside the Athens parliament as pressure mounts on the government to revoke unpopular reforms demanded by the country\u201ds creditors. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Timed to coincide with the arrival this week of international inspectors, the rally is one of scores taking place this evening around Greece by protestors aligned with the communist-run labour group Pame. In a sign of the disquiet measures have caused, some 436 labour groups have joined the protests seen as the first step in a campaign to send a \u201cfierce response\u201d to a government implementing \u201cbarbaric measures\u201d under the guise of progressive policy. Demonstrators denounced cuts that will reduce Greeks \u201cto further wretchedness\u201d demanding the reinstatement of collective work agreements that the ruling two party coalition has vowed to abolish along with other labour reforms. Meanwhile technical groups representing the EU and IMF have been poring over files in preparation of the arrival of mission chiefs. The review, projected by credit rating agency Fitch to take months, comes as government officials announced that prime minister Alexis Tsipras will meet the French and German leaders later this week to discuss the review. A combination of factors, but all revolving around the uncertainty over Brexit, have seen the UK market start the week on a negative note, falling further than its European peers. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Markets have started the week on a softer note with stocks and oil lower, yields streaking higher and havens including gold and the Japanese yen in demand. Reports of divisions between Chancellor Philip Hammond and the rest of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet over Brexit have caused investors to sell UK assets across the board. UK stocks, bonds and the pound were all lower on Monday. Over the weekend Mr Hammond was rumoured as preparing to quit over the divisions, though the Treasury has since denied this is the case. In a cabinet with some hot-headed opinions on Brexit, Mr Hammond is viewed by markets as a cooler cucumber. His departure and the resulting political uncertainty would likely see another nose-dive in the pound and exacerbate the rise in gilt yields. The EY Item Club calling the economic stability in the UK since the Brexit vote \u201cdeceptive\u201d and Open Europe suggesting banks could shift operations to Europe in 2017 without passporting rights are doing little to remedy shaken sentiment. The government bond sell-off has sent UK 10 year Gilt yields to the highest since the EU referendum, putting them on course for one of the biggest monthly rises in 20 years. US markets have also edged lower although positive results from Bank of America have helped limit the damage. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 66 points or 0.94% at 6947.55 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.73% to 10,503.57 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.46% at 4450.23 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.23% to 16,630.34 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.31% at 8740.7 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.55% to 586.06 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 24 points or 0.13%. Here\u2019s our latest report on the perceived tensions in the government over Brexit which have helped weaken the pound, from Peter Walker: Theresa May is keen to hear the \u201cdiffering views\u201d of ministers in the run-up to Brexit negotiations, her spokeswoman has said following cabinet media briefings against the chancellor, Philip Hammond, by pro-leave cabinet colleagues. In a sign of apparent cabinet tensions over the balance between limiting immigration and keeping open access to the EU, unnamed cabinet sources told two newspapers about anger towards Hammond over his concerns about plans to swiftly restrict immigration from the EU. But the prime minister\u2019s official spokeswoman told reporters: \u201cThe prime minister has full confidence in the chancellor and the work that he is doing.\u201d The chancellor is said to have used a meeting last week of May\u2019s cabinet Brexit committee to urge caution about a plan to force EU workers to show they have a guaranteed skilled job before they are allowed into Britain. The full story is here: It\u2019s not just against the dollar that the pound is weakening. It has slipped 0.24% against the euro to \u20ac1.1073, but this is still better than the six year low of \u20ac1.094 it reached last Tuesday. Oil prices are on the slide on renewed concerns that producer will be able to finalised a proposed deal to limit output when they meet next month in Vienna. Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Monday he was optimistic about a deal but when asked if his country\u2019s output was now high enough after its return on sanctions for it to join an agreement, he said: \u201cWe should decide in November how much each country should produce.\u201d The amount each country can produce could well prove a new stumbling block. At any rate, Brent crude is down 1% at $51.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has fallen 1.1% to $49.79. US markets have followed the general downward trend, ahead of a spate of important economic data later in the week, notably inflation figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 30 points or 0.17%, with markets unmoved by reasonable results from the likes of Bank of America and Hasbro. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Today\u2019s news that industrial production has returned to growth is the latest encouraging piece of data to come out of the US in recent weeks. It is also a very positive result considering the strength of the dollar and China\u2019s weakening trade demands. More US data, and a recovery in industrial production. Industrial output rose by 0.1% in September, better than the 0.5% fall seen in August but lower than the 0.3% expected. Manufacturing output rose by 0.2% in September, compared to expectations of no change and a 0.5% drop in August, revised down from the original 0.4% decline. Manufacturing capacity utilisation edged up from 74.8% to 74.9%. More on Tuesday\u2019s UK inflation figures, and Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, reckons the number could be higher than the market believes: The market is expecting prices to rise by an annual 0.9% rate last month, up from 0.6% in August. Core prices, which exclude energy and food prices, are also expected to pick up to 1.4% from 1.3%. We believe that the risks are to the upside for September\u2019s price data, as the impact of a weak pound continues to weigh on price pressure.... We think.. annual CPI could breach the 1% mark for September, while the market expects a reading of 0.9%. A strong inflation reading could be another reason to sell the pound tomorrow, which, ironically, could lead to even higher inflation in the coming months. If prices rise as we expect, then the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s 2% inflation target to be breached at some point in the first quarter of 2017. If, against the odds, CPI does not rise by as much as expected, then we would expect the pound to rally as it could brighten the UK economic outlook and put less pressure on future consumption. However, we view this outcome as unlikely at this stage. The Empire report says: Business activity continued to decline in New York State, according to firms responding to the October 2016 Empire State Manufacturing Survey. The headline general business conditions index slipped five points to -6.8. The new orders index edged up but remained negative at -5.6, indicating an ongoing drop in orders, and the shipments index increased to -0.6, suggesting that shipments were essentially flat. Labor market conditions remained weak, with both employment levels and the average workweek reported as lower. Price indexes increased somewhat, and continued to signal moderate input price increases and a slight increase in selling prices. But the outlook is more optimistic: Indexes for the six-month outlook suggested that manufacturing firms expect conditions to improve in the months ahead. The latest snapshot of US manufacturing - in this case in New York state - has shown a shock plunge rather than the expected revival. The New York Empire manufacturing index came in at -6.8 in October compared to -2.0 in September and forecasts of a rebound to 1.1. This is the lowest level since May. Another reason for the slide in bond prices, and subsequent rise in yields, is recent comments from central bankers on their willingness to tolerate an increase in inflation. On Friday Bank of England governor Mark Carney said he was willing to let inflation run a bit higher than the Bank\u2019s 2% target to help boost the economy and employment. Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, said something similar a little later, saying there were plausible ways to let higher inflation lift the economy. Higher inflation erodes the fixed payments on bonds, adding to the downbeat mood. So UK inflation figures on Tuesday will be widely watched, with consumer prices expected to rise by an annual 0.9% in September, up from 0.6% in August. It\u2019s a thin day for data but there are some US figures out later. Ahead of that, the futures are suggesting an opening fall on Wall Street. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Looking to the US open and the Dow Jones seems fairly uninterested this Monday, with the futures suggesting a 40 point fall after the bell. There is a string of B-tier data for the US index to deal with this afternoon; the Empire State manufacturing index is set to bounce back to 1.1 from -2.0, while the capacity utilization rate is expected to edge up 0.1% to 75.6% and the industrial production reading is forecast to climb back to 0.3% from -0.4% last month. The pound continues to hover below $1.22 against the dollar, and is currently down 0.3% at $1.2144, a new low for the day as US traders begin to start work. That is nowhere near the levels hit during the flash crash earlier this month, of course, when it fell as low as $1.1491, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Reuters has just issued a report saying that sterling traded more than three times its daily average against the dollar in the 24 hours following the flash crash, showing the volatility and nervousness around the currency at the moment. Newsflash from Downing Street: Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has insisted the prime minister has \u2018full confidence\u2019 in Philip Hammond, following reports of a split with other cabinet members over Brexit. The PM also respects the Bank of England\u2019s independence -- which is reassuring, until you realise that this ought to go without saying.... (reminder, May criticised the BoE\u2019s stimulus programme during her party conference two weeks ago, prompting governor Mark Carney to hit back on Friday). Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has more details from today\u2019s briefing to Lobby journalists: The disputes between Philip Hammond and the Brexiteers in the cabinet are hitting shares, the pound and government debt today, according to one analyst. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says rumours (now denied) that the chancellor might quit are alarming investors. Over the weekend Mr Hammond was rumoured as preparing to quit over the divisions, though the Treasury has since denied this is the case. In a cabinet with some hot-headed opinions on Brexit, Mr Hammond is viewed by markets as a cooler cucumber. His departure and the resulting political uncertainty would likely see another nose-dive in the pound and exacerbate the rise in gilt yields. Mr Hammond is thought to prefer a plan in which migration curbs are delayed and Britain would pay into the EU budget for single market access. It\u2019s a stance that would be welcomed by markets but he has been described as \u201carguing like an accountant\u201d and \u201conly seeing the risks\u201d by fellow MPs. So that\u2019s why 10-year UK gilt prices have hit their lowest level since the referendum (see earlier post), sending yields up. And housebuilders are also falling in value today, Lawler adds, matching the rise in gilt yields. Barratt Developments is one of the biggest decliners on the FTSE 100. Higher interest rates lead to higher mortgages, which is typically not good for the housing market since it makes borrowing to buy a house more expensive. So, the FTSE 100 is now down by 55 points, or 0.8%, at 6957 points, with almost every share falling. The pound still near a 31-year low against the US dollar, at $1.2167. And 10-year gilt yields (a measure of UK borrowing costs) are hovering around 1.17%, from 1.1% on Friday. The FT published a good piece yesterday, pointing out how car parts whizz around the EU on their journey from raw materials to finished product. In some cases, they could cross the Channel five times -- creating a serious headache for auto makers if Britain left the single market. The piece is here. Here\u2019s a flavour: Bumpers for some Bentley Bentaygas, for example, are made in Europe but then sent to Crewe for inspection before then going to Germany for specialist painting. After that, they return to the UK for final assembly. Another example of the interconnectedness of the supply chain is a fuel injector for diesel lorries manufactured by the US component maker Delphi. This part uses steel from Europe which is machined in the UK before going to Germany for special heat treatment. The injector is then assembled at Delphi\u2019s UK plant in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, before being sold on to truckmakers based in Sweden, France or Germany. If the resulting truck is sold into the UK market, the component or materials used in it will have crossed the Channel five times before the lorry is ever driven by the customer. If tariffs are applied at each stage, the cost could be substantial. Britain isn\u2019t alone. Germany\u2019s borrowing costs have also hit their highest level since the EU referendum: A tiny gobbet of economic data \u2013 inflation in the euro area rose by 0.4% in September, up from 0.2% in August. That\u2019s the highest in nearly two years. Higher prices at restaurants &amp; caf\u00e9s pushed living costs up, along with more expensive rent, food and tobacco. Energy prices still pulled inflation down, but by less than earlier this year. The slump in the pound since June\u2019s Brexit vote isn\u2019t a bad thing, according to Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England. He told BBC Radio 5 this morning that sterling has helped to cushion the shock of the referendum result. According to Broadbent: \u201cHaving a flexible currency is an extremely important thing, especially in an environment when your economy faces shocks that are different from your trading partners.\u201d \u201cIn the shape of the referendum, we\u2019ve had exactly one of those shocks. Allowing the currency to react to that I think is a very important shock absorber. Hurrah for floating exchange rates, eh? However... analysts at Deutsche Bank aren\u2019t convinced that the weak pound will give UK factories a major boost. They argue that modern trade is simply too complicated.... International economics has evolved since the Victorian era, and world trade no longer consists of final consumption goods being bartered for raw materials. The rise of global value chains has come with huge growth in the trade of intermediate and capital goods. Any economy\u2019s manufacturing exports today contain a significant chunk of value that is added abroad. We find that the low domestic value added in UK manufacturing means sterling depreciation will hurt exporters as well as help them This morning\u2019s selloff in UK government debt is gathering pace, as the City ponders the tensions in the Ten-year gilts (bonds that mature in a decade\u2019s time) are dropping in value, to levels not seen since the aftermath of the Brexit vote. This chart shows how the price of gilts has dropped back in recent weeks, and is now the lowest since late June. As prices fall, borrowing costs rise. And the interest rate (yield) on 10-year gilts has now jumped to 1.2%, from 1.1% on Friday night. That indicates that it will cost the government more to issue new debt to cover the gap between tax revenues and spending. And the pound is still under some pressure, bobbing around $1.217. Traders said the selloff in gilts was hurting sentiment towards the currency, Reuters reports. Over in Westminster, health secretary Jeremy Hunt has done his best to calm talk of cabinet infighting. Ministers are just having a \u2018lively debate\u2019, he says. That\u2019s via our Politics Liveblogger, Andy Sparrow, who writes: Theresa May\u2019s government has only been in office for three months but already cabinet infighting has hit peak intensity on the \u201cferrets in a sack\u201d scale. Amazingly, there was even a story yesterday (which was denied) claiming that Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was on the verge of resignation because he was so fed up. He\u2019ll be tracking all the latest punch-ups lively debates here: Here\u2019s our latest news story on the cabinet split over Brexit: And some snap reaction from a former Downing Street insider: (Ben Wegg-Prosser was Tony Blair\u2019s director of strategic communications). Sterling is also weaker against the euro this morning, down 0.25% at \u20ac1.108. That\u2019s close to a five-year low. Again, that\u2019s not a massive fall, but it does suggest that reports of a row between Philip Hammond and other cabinet ministers are weighing on the pound. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: A number of UK newspapers\u2019 front-pages lead this morning with reports of disagreements within the cabinet between the Chancellor and his colleagues over the terms of the UK\u2019s EU exit. The disagreements stem from differences over whether the UK should prioritise maintaining single market or controlling migration post-exit. The Treasury denied claims in the Telegraph newspaper that Phillip Hammond was set to resign over as Chancellor over the government\u2019s approach to Brexit. This chart shows how British borrowing costs have jumped this month: London\u2019s stock market has started the week on the back foot. The FTSE 100 index has fallen back through the 7,000 point mark, as it sheds 36 points to hover at about 6,977. The education group Pearson is leading the sell-off, sliding by 5% after reporting a drop in sales amid \u201ctough conditions\u201d. Conner Campbell of SpredEx says: Another day, another set of Brexit headlines, with reports of cabinet splits and City passport fears causing a gloomy start to the week. British government debt is weakening in value this morning, in another sign that investors are worrying about the UK economy. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year government gilts has risen to 1.18%, from 1.1% on Friday night. Yields move inversely to prices, so this means gilts are falling in value. It\u2019s quite a large move for a Monday morning, and pushes yields to their highest level since the referendum. It suggests traders are anticipating a jump in UK inflation, as the weak pound drives up import prices It\u2019s not a reason to panic -- Britain\u2019s borrowing cost are still very low, in historical terms. But it does mean that the cost of financing the deficit is rising.... Kathleen Brooks of City Index confirms that those political tensions are weighing on the pound this morning. She points out that sterling has had a shocking few weeks -- even against countries whose finance minister are facing criminal charges: Although the Treasury has denied that Philip Hammond will quit his post, it doesn\u2019t help to instil confidence in the pound. The British pound is down more than 5% so far this month vs. the US dollar; it is also weaker against every other G10 currency. To put this month\u2019s fall into context, the pound is weaker against the majority of emerging market currencies, including the resurgent Mexican peso, and the Malaysian ringgit. The South African rand managed to eek out a gain vs. the pound, even thought its finance minister was recently hit with charges of criminal misconduct. In fact, the pound is starting to act like an emerging market currency, with volatile price swings, and no stabiliser to limit the selling pressure. Risks of a break up of the United Kingdom and further signs of tension in Downing Street over the Prime Minister\u2019s handling of Brexit, are the chief concerns of the currency market right now, and until these issues go away the pound is likely to remain the market\u2019s favourite whipping boy. Sterling has come under renewed pressure in early trading, amid reports of tensions at the heart of the UK government. The pound is bobbing below the $1.22 mark, hitting a low of $1.215, which is close to a 31-year low against the US dollar. Investors are disconcerted by front-page tales of a rift between chancellor Philip Hammond and other cabinet members, over the government\u2019s Brexit strategy. According to the Daily Telegraph, Hammond has been accused of trying to undermine Brexit by pushing for delays to cabinet measures designed to control immigration. He\u2019s even accused of behaving \u201clike an accountant\u201d, rather than seizing the opportunities of life outside the EU. Here\u2019s a flavour: Members of the cabinet are said to be growing increasingly frustrated by Mr Hammond\u2019s position on Brexit. One cabinet source said he was \u201coverly influenced by his Treasury officials who think it is a catastrophe that Britain voted to leave the EU\u201d. Another source said: \u201cHe is arguing from a very Treasury point of view. He is arguing like an accountant seeing the risk of everything rather than the opportunity.\u201d There are very big personalities arguing different things. It\u2019s not easy Another source suggested that while the Treasury is quick to criticise solutions proposed by members of the cabinet, it has been \u201cless forthcoming\u201d in tabling its own policies. The Times also report that Hammond has annoyed colleagues by pushing back against migration curbs, arguing that UK businesses will suffer: There are also reports that Hammond isn\u2019t happy about being excluded from some key strategy meetings. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the City is also anxious about relations between the government and the Bank of England, after Mark Carney insisted last week he wouldn\u2019t take orders from politicians. Lots for investors to worry about.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s exit from the EU looms over the City at the start of a busy week for investors. Overnight, the Open Europe thinktank has warned that banks could shift operations out of London by the end of 2017, if they fear losing the \u201cpassporting\u201d right to sell services across the EU. Vincenzo Scarpetta, Open Europe\u2019s senior policy analyst, said firms were preparing for the worst. \u201cThere are plans in case the UK were to leave the single market without any kind of regulatory equivalence,\u201d he said. \u201cThese plans may be set into motion early on if the uncertainty drags on for too long.\u201d But could the government cut a deal to keep the City in the single market? The Financial Time is reporting that the government is considering paying billions into the EU budget to retain access to the single market. That may not be what Brexit voters expected, but it might protect vital parts of the UK economy. On Tuesday, we get the latest UK inflation rate, which may show that the weak pound drove prices up in September. That\u2019s followed by unemployment figures on Wednesday. Although Britain\u2019s economy has coped well since the June referendum, analysts are expecting a slowdown. The EY Item Club thinktank reckons growth will slow to just 0.8% in 2017, from 1.9% this year, as inflation jumps and consumers spend less. Also coming up today.. Looking ahead, there\u2019s no UK economic data in the diary. But we do get a final estimate of Eurozone inflation for September (at 10am), and a healthcheck on the US manufacturing sector:",

Vice chairman Stanley Fischer said i<strong><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20161017a.htm\">n a speech in New York</a></strong> there were three reasons to be concerned about low rates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, and most worrying, is the possibility that low long-term interest rates are a signal that the economy\u2019s long-run growth prospects are dim...A second concern is that low interest rates make the economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks that can put it in a recession...And the third concern is that low interest rates may also threaten financial stability as some investors reach for yield and compressed net interest margins make it harder for some financial institutions to build up capital buffers...</p> <p>Those are three powerful reasons to prefer interest rates that are higher than current rates. But, of course, Fed interest rates are kept very low at the moment because of the need to maintain aggregate demand at levels that will support the attainment of our dual policy goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, defined as the rate of inflation in the price level of personal consumption expenditures.. being at our target level of 2 percent.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said there were a variety of factors holding down interest rates - including slow economic growth, low investment, a slowdown in the global economy - and they may continue to go so for some time.</p> <p>But he added economic policy could help offset these factors, and boost the economy\u2019s growth potential:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While there is disagreement about what the most effective policies would be, some combination of more encouragement for private investment, improved public infrastructure, better education, and more effective regulation is likely to promote faster growth of productivity and living standards--and also to reduce the probability that the economy and, particularly, the central bank will in the future have to contend with the effective lower bound.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T17:09:00.287Z\">at 6.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804f9b8e4b0cd26ff71e06f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T16:21:50.588Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek protestors as inspectors arrive</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Greece thousands of leftwing protestors are demonstrating outside the Athens parliament as pressure mounts on the government to revoke unpopular reforms demanded by the country\u201ds creditors.

The brand, which started as an online subscription service with its products delivered through the post in brown boxes, will expand into more than 3,500 US stores from this week on the back of its growth in the UK. Graze only moved into physical shops in the UK last year but its nuts, brownies and popcorn are now on sale in more than 5,000 stores, including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Boots. Graze has become Boots third largest food brand and will expand into the retailer\u2019s sister chain in the US, Walgreens. The British supermarkets and Boots have placed Graze products in prominent positions next to their tills after removing confectionery from these shelves amid a government drive to crack down on childhood obesity. However, Graze\u2019s expansion from a solely online subscription business \u2013 which was available in the UK and US \u2013 to appearing in stores as well has led to a slowdown in sales growth in the past year. Revenues grew by 3.2% in the year to 29 February 2016 to \u00a370.3m. This was down on the sales growth of 29% last year as some customers switched from making internet orders to instore purchases, thereby cannibalising sales. Underlying profits before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell from \u00a39.5m to \u00a37.6m. However, Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze, said he was pleased with the performance and stated that the company is well-placed for significant growth over the next year. Graze has returned to a double-digit percentage growth in sales year-on-year since the end of February. \u201cPeople really do want healthy foods,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cFar too many of the brands are unhealthy and the market hasn\u2019t caught up. \u201cThere are plenty of healthy foods out there but they are not exciting to eat \u2013 that is the multimillion-pound opportunity. At the moment retailers are over the moon, we have solved a problem for them.\u201d Fletcher admitted that the online business had \u201cshrunk\u201d and that its profitability had been \u201csignificantly affected\u201d by Royal Mail changing the terms of its delivery agreement with the company. As well as expanding into US shops, Graze has agreed a potentially lucrative deal with Facebook worth tens of thousands of dollars a month to supply food to its office in Silicon Valley. Graze, which launches three new products a week on average, has remodelled its range for US customers, with new products including Sweet Memphis BBQ, New York Everything Bagel and Spicy Sriracha Crunch. Graze was founded in 2008 by seven friends as an online business selling snacks through the post. The company is controlled by the private equity group Carlyle, with Octopus Investments, Draper Esprit and the management team owning small stakes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Since 2010, when the coalition embarked on austerity, one profession has turned cuts to the public sector into a business opportunity: management consultants. How did they get the gig? Are they doing essential work for beleaguered services or are they charlatans with a PowerPoint presentation? You might ask why Whitehall and councils can\u2019t make these decisions for themselves, but the severity of the cuts has meant that the people who normally make the cuts have themselves been cut. An entire strata of bureaucracy has disappeared, and management consultants have filled the hole. They advise on decisions that will profoundly alter the shape of public services in Britain, and so how they make these judgments is crucially important. David Craig, a former management consultant with 30 years\u2019 experience, explains that their aggressive business plan involves a problem-finding strategy. \u201cWhat you\u2019re looking for is something that gives a big emotional shock to the client. We want to take them to what we call the \u2018valley of death\u2019.\u201d The \u201cvalley of death\u201d is the apocalypse scenario, telling the troubled organisation that if they don\u2019t do something huge and expensive to change quickly, it\u2019s going to fail, fast. Very few organisations need a complete overhaul; they need sensible tweaks. But this, Craig says, doesn\u2019t sound dramatic. That\u2019s why you hear consultants refer continuously to \u201ctransformation programmes\u201d. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve taken them into the valley of death, it\u2019s time for salvation. Now we go to the sunny uplands: it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s really bad, but working together we can save the situation. It\u2019ll only cost you two or three million, or maybe you need to buy a computer system for another 50 million.\u201d This strategy of finding things to fix once you\u2019ve got your foot in the door is known in the trade as \u201cland and expand\u201d. \u201cYou start to uncover issues in an organisation and put them under pressure,\u201d says John Bennett, a former management consultant to the public sector. But is this cynical or just good business? In Wales, PricewaterhouseCoopers rolled out a template called an \u201coperating model assessment\u201d across numerous councils, pocketing more than \u00a35m. But this initial work, Bennett says, was to land bigger money with something called a \u201crisk and reward\u201d contract. Instead of accepting a fee upfront, the consultancy firm takes a percentage on any savings it can find. The more cuts that are made, the more money it takes. One council in south Wales entered into a \u201crisk and reward\u201d contract that reportedly netted PwC 16% profits on all cuts made. This might seem outrageous, but it\u2019s a neat solution to a tricky situation. Councils accused of hiring expensive consultants can use a contract that avoids upfront money. And consultants have a stake in working hard to find new savings rather than rolling out a template. PwC says: \u201cIt is important that our work delivers a tangible return on taxpayers\u2019 investment. Our fees are often \u2013 and increasingly \u2013 dependent on the performance of our services, whereby we are only paid in full if we deliver the full benefits agreed.\u201d But is it morally right that management consultants are making a profit from cuts to public services? \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely right that they should be rewarded for achieving what the public sector wants to achieve,\u201d says Alan Leaman, chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association. Anthony Hunt, the leader of another Welsh council, Torfaen, says that if the advice leads to some services being protected, then it\u2019s a price worth paying. The danger comes when \u201cstrategic partnerships\u201d with consultants create a dependency on consultants. Consultants have been at the heart of government since the late 60s. Under Harold Wilson\u2019s technocratic revolution, the civil service wasn\u2019t trusted to deliver radical reform. The then minister of technology, Tony Benn, believed outside experts were the only way to make change happen. And so the allure of the \u201cexpert\u201d was cemented in the minds of politicians of all political persuasions, and parts of Whitehall\u2019s civil service were sidelined. Some accountants and IT managers turned consultants, became outsourcing suppliers, running everything from prisons to road maintenance. They had figured out that actually running a contract worth billions was more lucrative than advising on who should run it, for mere millions. McKinsey &amp; Company has advised and restructured everyone from the White House to General Motors since the 1920s. But it has also been entangled in Enron and John Major\u2019s privatisation of Britain\u2019s railways. Firms such as McKinsey have been at the heart of government for so long, they arguably now provide the continuity and in-house knowledge the civil service once did, so the question is: what\u2019s the problem? The answer might be lack of transparency, which creates suspicion, even if it may be unfounded. There are good consultants out there, doing valuable work helping public services in critical condition stay alive. Their work is focused and necessary but here\u2019s the key thing: they walk away when the job is done. It\u2019s just the other kind we should worry about. \u2022 Who\u2019s Spending Britain\u2019s Billions? is on BBC Two, Tuesday 18 October at 8pm",

But is this cynical or just good business?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b1b258a3578006f362a994edd50fc92c3123444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b1b258a3578006f362a994edd50fc92c3123444/0_237_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The London HQ of PricewaterhouseCoopers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The London HQ of PricewaterhouseCoopers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Wales, PricewaterhouseCoopers rolled out a template called an \u201coperating model assessment\u201d across numerous councils, pocketing more than \u00a35m. But this initial work, Bennett says, was to land bigger money with something called a \u201crisk and reward\u201d contract. Instead of accepting a fee upfront, the consultancy firm takes a percentage on any savings it can find. The more cuts that are made, the more money it takes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108182&amp;headline=Council%20paid%20consultants%20another%20%C2%A31m%20in%20eight%20months&amp;sectionIs=news&amp;searchyear=2016\">One council in south Wales</a> entered into a \u201crisk and reward\u201d contract that reportedly netted PwC 16% profits on all cuts made.</p> <p>This might seem outrageous, but it\u2019s a neat solution to a tricky situation. Councils accused of hiring expensive consultants can use a contract that avoids upfront money. And consultants have a stake in working hard to find new savings rather than rolling out a template.</p> <p>PwC says: \u201cIt is important that our work delivers a tangible return on taxpayers\u2019 investment. Our fees are often \u2013 and increasingly \u2013 dependent on the performance of our services, whereby we are only paid in full if we deliver the full benefits agreed.\u201d</p> <p>But is it morally right that management consultants are making a profit from cuts to public services? \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely right that they should be rewarded for achieving what the public sector wants to achieve,\u201d says <a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alan-leaman-ba22b711\">Alan Leaman</a>, chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association.</p> <p>Anthony Hunt, the leader of another Welsh council, Torfaen, says that if the advice leads to some services being protected, then it\u2019s a price worth paying. The danger comes when \u201cstrategic partnerships\u201d with consultants create a dependency on consultants.</p> <p>Consultants have been at the heart of government since the late 60s. Under Harold Wilson\u2019s technocratic revolution, the civil service wasn\u2019t trusted to deliver radical reform. The then minister of technology, Tony Benn, believed outside experts were the only way to make change happen. And so the allure of the \u201cexpert\u201d was cemented in the minds of politicians of all political persuasions, and parts of Whitehall\u2019s civil service were sidelined.</p> <p>Some accountants and IT managers turned consultants, became outsourcing suppliers, running everything from prisons to road maintenance. They had figured out that actually running a contract worth billions was more lucrative than advising on who should run it, for mere millions.</p> <p>McKinsey &amp; Company has advised and restructured everyone from the White House to General Motors since the 1920s. But it has also been entangled in Enron and John Major\u2019s privatisation of Britain\u2019s railways. Firms such as McKinsey have been at the heart of government for so long, they arguably now provide the continuity and in-house knowledge the civil service once did, so the question is: what\u2019s the problem?</p> <p>The answer might be lack of transparency, which creates suspicion, even if it may be unfounded. There are good consultants out there, doing valuable work helping public services in critical condition stay alive. Their work is focused and necessary but here\u2019s the key thing: they walk away when the job is done. It\u2019s just the other kind we should worry about.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0803b0s\"><em>Who\u2019s Spending Britain\u2019s Billions?</em></a><em> is on BBC Two, Tuesday 18 October at 8pm</em><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Billionaires are shunning the London luxury property market, with sales of \u201csuper prime\u201d \u00a310m-plus homes in the capital collapsing by 86% over the past year. Just five properties were sold for more than \u00a310m in the three months to August 2016, according to an analysis of Land Registry data, compared with 35 in the same period a year earlier. Outside of London, not a single property was sold for more than \u00a310m, compared with ten last year. The average price paid also fell steeply, from \u00a322m to \u00a316.3m, said property group London Central Portfolio, which carried out the analysis. It blamed increasing property taxes, such as the sharp hike in stamp duty and new obligations on non-dom foreign buyers, rather than Brexit, for the decline in prices and activity. Worried developers are now scaling down the most opulent projects, with one newbuild Mayfair block reworked to provide more, smaller, flats in a bid to find buyers. Newbuild sales have slumped in particular, said LCP, which runs investment funds of high-end central London apartments. No super-prime newbuild units were sold over the three-month period, compared with last year where they made up 23% of sales. Naomi Heaton of LCP said: \u201cA price correction was inevitable and is widely reflected in reports of price discounting. Whilst the long term outlook remains compelling, the luxury market is likely to experience continued instability especially in the face of the forthcoming \u2018look through\u2019 non-dom inheritance tax ... it may take some years before growth returns.\u201d Many will cheer any downturn in the London property market after years in which price rises have far outstripped local incomes, even of the well-off. Separate research by estate agents Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff has found that homes for sale at less than \u00a3100,000 are now extinct in the capital, and suggests that this year homes under \u00a3120,000 will completely vanish. But Heaton said the slowdown in the luxury property market should be \u201cvery concerning\u201d for the Treasury as it would lead to a decline in stamp duty receipts. She estimated that the reduction in super-prime activity in the last three months alone meant the government could face a \u00a345m fall in stamp duty receipts. The government\u2019s haul from stamp duty, particularly in London, has soared over the past year, but Heaton said that may now hit the buffers. The sudden disappearance of super-rich buyers is forcing developers to reconsider their plans. \u201cMany are looking to divide large, high-priced property into smaller flats to increase their attractiveness. Clivedale, for example, is reworking its flagship Hanover Square development to create four times more units, whilst the green light has been given to Citygrove Securities and McClaren Properties to replace seven Chelsea townhouses with smaller units,\u201d said LCP. Rents are also falling, partly as sellers unable to find buyers choose to rent out their properties instead. Separate data from upmarket property agents Knight Frank found that rents in prime central London locations fell by 4.7% in the year to September, although the number of tenancies agreed reached a record high. But it said the sales market had not fallen as steeply as the LCP figures suggest. It found that price falls were 2.1% in the year to September, noting that the amount of time it took for a property to sell was 14% higher than at the start of the year. Sterling\u2019s 20% devaluation since the EU referendum may bring foreign buyers back into the luxury London market. According to Juwai, which claims to be the biggest international property website for Chinese investors, inquiries were up 12% in August to a record high as the yuan-rich scout around for bargain buys in London. \u201cIronically, the rapid devaluation of sterling, now attracting foreign investors back to London, may be the biggest hope of salvaging a potentially embarrassing and costly situation,\u201d said Heaton. But the chances of normal people picking up a bargain is remote. The single most expensive residential property sold in the UK during the past three months still went for \u00a325m despite the slowdown \u2013 and even then it was a \u201cfixer-upper\u201d requiring total renovation. The six-storey house, 112 Eaton Square, went for just \u00a31.5m less than its \u00a326.5m asking price. The property, famous as the location where a group of rebel Tory MPs plotted to topple wartime prime minister Neville Chamberlain, has been empty for 20 years and the buyer will have spend millions on a restoration.

    "webTitle": "Heathrow third runway close to getting government green light", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Heathrow is edging closer to securing government approval for a third runway after the airport indicated that a last-minute Whitehall study into concerns over pollution will give the all-clear. The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said he had \u201cno reason to believe\u201d that any issues had been raised in research conducted this year by the Department for Transport into air quality around Heathrow, despite consistent breaches of legal limits. He said: \u201cEverything we have seen suggests that it won\u2019t be an issue. I suspect if it were we would know about that by now.\u201d The comments came as it emerged that a cabinet subcommittee on Heathrow will not make a final decision on Tuesday, as previously thought, but on 25 October. Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman refused to comment on reports that the full cabinet would discuss the matter on Tuesday, stressing that she would not disclose in advance the content of cabinet meetings. Holland-Kaye told the Guardian that a recent independent study by Cambridge researchers into air quality, separate to the DfT study, had bolstered Heathrow\u2019s case. He added that pollution studies had not taken into account further mitigation measures put in place by Heathrow that would counter the pollution impact from car traffic created by millions more passengers using an expanded airport. The Heathrow boss also claimed that approving a third runway was no longer the difficult political choice for the prime minister. \u201cWhat was once seen as a difficult political decision is becoming a much easier one.\u201d He pointed to support for expansion demonstrated on Monday in letters to May from 50 MPs and representatives from the major parties in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish devolved assemblies, as well as from representatives of Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite. Labour sources also said the party would back a third runway, despite the opposition of the leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the \u201cimperative was overwhelming\u201d for more capacity and implied he would back Heathrow over Gatwick. With 25 October looking the most likely date for the government to finally respond to the Airports Commission report of July 2015 that recommended expanding Heathrow, May\u2019s spokeswoman denied that the decision had been pushed back \u2013 saying that the decision would come \u201csoon\u201d. Ministers have never ruled out the rival plans of Gatwick, which hopes to build a second runway, while a third option, to lengthen one of Heathrow\u2019s existing runways, remains on the table. \u201cThe government is very clear on the importance of making a decision, the need that there is to address the problems around airport capacity and the huge potential economic opportunities of airport expansion,\u201d said the spokeswoman. \u201cClearly it\u2019s a decision that it\u2019s important to get right so that future generations can benefit.\u201d She added: \u201cYou can expect the decision soon. There has been no change in timing.\u201d The cabinet subcommittee deciding will exclude prominent ministerial opponents of Heathrow, such as Justine Greening and Boris Johnson. Heathrow remains confident that most MPs will back its plans. Holland-Kaye said: \u201cThe benefit of the Airport Commission process is that it\u2019s got us to a place where we\u2019ve got a much better plan. It\u2019s been a public process where we\u2019ve consulted with communities on what\u2019s acceptable.\u201d He said that by meeting new conditions and altering the scheme, the airport\u2019s expansion now had the backing \u201cof business, politicians, and unions, and even support from local people\u201d. As a result, Holland-Kaye said: \u201cIt makes it far more deliverable. It\u2019s got far more support than other infrastructure projects such as HS2.\u201d While he said the imminent decision was the key moment, he promised that Heathrow would \u201ckeep on listening\u201d to communities while drawing up plans. The third runway could be built by 2025 and would cost \u00a317.6bn. Gatwick airport has also said it will remain on standby to deliver its own plan for a second runway even if Heathrow\u2019s gets the green light next week. London\u2019s second airport believes that legal and political challenges will halt the west London hub\u2019s expansion once again. It warned again on Monday that the number of people overflown by a new runway at Heathrow would be 70 times more than would be affected by a second runway at Gatwick. A new runway at Heathrow would affect 278,000 people compared with 3,800 for Gatwick\u2019s plans. New flightpaths at Heathrow would cross prime residential areas of London whose inhabitants have so far escaped aircraft noise, including St John\u2019s Wood, Maida Vale, Kensington, Notting Hill and Shepherd\u2019s Bush. Gatwick\u2019s chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: \u201cThe difference in noise impact between the two schemes is stark. We have to decide whether to ignore the views of a million Londoners whose health will be affected by constant noise, or expand Gatwick, the environmentally responsible option where we can cap the number most affected by noise.\u201d Meanwhile, Greenpeace said it had joined forces with councils surrounding Heathrow to launch a legal challenge to any new runway. The environmental campaign group said it would contribute costs alongside Hillingdon, Richmond, Wandsworth and Windsor and Maidenhead councils to instruct lawyers to seek a judicial review over the environmental impacts of a decision to go ahead. The Greenpeace UK executive director, John Sauven, said: \u201cA third runway at Heathrow would be an air pollution and carbon timebomb.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Heathrow is edging closer to securing government approval for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/heathrow-airport\">third runway</a> after the airport indicated that a last-minute Whitehall study into concerns over pollution will give the all-clear.</p> <p>The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said he had \u201cno reason to believe\u201d that any issues had been raised in research conducted this year by the Department for Transport into air quality around Heathrow, despite consistent breaches of legal limits. He said: \u201cEverything we have seen suggests that it won\u2019t be an issue. I suspect if it were we would know about that by now.\u201d</p> <p>The comments came as it emerged that a cabinet subcommittee on Heathrow will not make a final decision on Tuesday, as previously thought, but on 25 October. Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman refused to comment on reports that the full cabinet would discuss the matter on Tuesday, stressing that she would not disclose in advance the content of cabinet meetings.</p> <p>Holland-Kaye told the Guardian that a recent independent study by Cambridge researchers into air quality, separate to the DfT study, had bolstered Heathrow\u2019s case. He added that pollution studies had not taken into account further mitigation measures put in place by Heathrow that would counter the pollution impact from car traffic created by millions more passengers using an expanded airport.</p> <p>The Heathrow boss also claimed that approving a third runway was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/16/heathrow-airport-expansion-third-runway-labour-decision\">no longer the difficult political choice for the prime minister</a>. \u201cWhat was once seen as a difficult political decision is becoming a much easier one.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to support for expansion demonstrated on Monday in letters to May from 50 MPs and representatives from the major parties in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish devolved assemblies, as well as from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/14/unions-write-to-labour-mps-urging-them-to-back-heathrow-expansion\">representatives of Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite</a>. Labour sources also said <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/16/heathrow-airport-expansion-third-runway-labour-decision\">the party would back a third runway</a>, despite the opposition of the leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the \u201cimperative was overwhelming\u201d for more capacity and implied he would back Heathrow over Gatwick. </p> <p>With 25 October looking the most likely date for the government to finally respond to the Airports Commission report of July 2015 that recommended expanding Heathrow, May\u2019s spokeswoman denied that the decision had been pushed back \u2013 saying that the decision would come \u201csoon\u201d. Ministers have never ruled out the rival plans of Gatwick, which hopes to build a second runway, while a third option, to lengthen one of Heathrow\u2019s existing runways, remains on the table.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is very clear on the importance of making a decision, the need that there is to address the problems around airport capacity and the huge potential economic opportunities of airport expansion,\u201d said the spokeswoman.</p> <p>\u201cClearly it\u2019s a decision that it\u2019s important to get right so that future generations can benefit.\u201d She added: \u201cYou can expect the decision soon. There has been no change in timing.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>The cabinet subcommittee deciding will exclude <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/14/anti-heathrow-mps-plan-undermine-government-third-runway-approval\">prominent ministerial opponents of Heathrow</a>, such as Justine Greening and Boris Johnson. Heathrow remains confident that most MPs will back its plans.</p> <p>Holland-Kaye said: \u201cThe benefit of the Airport Commission process is that it\u2019s got us to a place where we\u2019ve got a much better plan. It\u2019s been a public process where we\u2019ve consulted with communities on what\u2019s acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>He said that by meeting new conditions and altering the scheme, the airport\u2019s expansion now had the backing \u201cof business, politicians, and unions, and even support from local people\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As a result, Holland-Kaye said: \u201cIt makes it far more deliverable. It\u2019s got far more support than other infrastructure projects such as HS2.\u201d</p> <p>While he said the imminent decision was the key moment, he promised that Heathrow would \u201ckeep on listening\u201d to communities while drawing up plans.</p> <p>The third runway could be built by 2025 and would cost \u00a317.6bn. </p> <p>Gatwick airport has also said it will remain on standby to deliver its own plan for a second runway even if Heathrow\u2019s gets the green light next week. London\u2019s second airport believes that legal and political challenges will halt the west London hub\u2019s expansion once again.</p> <p>It warned again on Monday that the number of people overflown by a new runway at Heathrow would be 70 times more than would be affected by a second runway at Gatwick. A new runway at Heathrow would affect 278,000 people compared with 3,800 for Gatwick\u2019s plans. New flightpaths at Heathrow would cross prime residential areas of London whose inhabitants have so far escaped aircraft noise, including St John\u2019s Wood, Maida Vale, Kensington, Notting Hill and Shepherd\u2019s Bush.</p> <p>Gatwick\u2019s chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: \u201cThe difference in noise impact between the two schemes is stark. We have to decide whether to ignore the views of a million Londoners whose health will be affected by constant noise, or expand Gatwick, the environmentally responsible option where we can cap the number most affected by noise.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, Greenpeace said it had joined forces with councils surrounding Heathrow to launch a legal challenge to any new runway. The environmental campaign group said it would contribute costs alongside Hillingdon, Richmond, Wandsworth and Windsor and Maidenhead councils to instruct lawyers to seek a judicial review over the environmental impacts of a decision to go ahead.</p> <p>The Greenpeace UK executive director, John Sauven, said: \u201cA third runway at Heathrow would be an air pollution and carbon timebomb.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ladbrokes and Gala Coral have agreed to sell 359 betting shops to rival bookmakers in an attempt to meet the competition regulator\u2019s requirements for approving their \u00a32.3bn merger. The companies said they would sell 322 shops to Betfred for \u00a355m in cash and a further 37 to Stan James for \u00a3500,000 after the merger of Ladbrokes and Gala Coral. Ladbrokes will sell 185 shops and Gala Coral will sell 174. The money will be used to repay debt. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has ordered the companies to sell 350-400 shops to ensure customers have a choice of bookmakers in a large number of local areas. Ladbrokes has about 2,100 UK shops and Gala Coral has 1,800, meaning the combined company would overtake William Hill, with almost 2,400, as Britain\u2019s biggest bookmaker by number of stores. Ladbrokes said the companies would ask the CMA to approve the merger based on the planned sales and talks to offload one more shop. A Ladbrokes spokesman said, based on talks with the CMA, the companies believed the sales would meet the regulator\u2019s concerns about competition in specific locations. When it ordered the companies to sell shops the CMA said the merger could reduce the number of discounts and free bets offered by bookmakers competing locally and lead to betting odds, which are set nationally, less favourable for customers. Jim Mullen, Ladbrokes\u2019 chief executive, said: \u201cThe sale of these shops will clear the last significant hurdle to delivering on the merger with Coral and paves the way for our focus on completion and quickly delivering on the opportunities the merger offers.\u201d Ladbrokes agreed the terms of its all-share merger with Coral in July 2015 and its shareholders backed the deal in November. The companies hope to complete the transaction by the end of October if the CMA approves its plans. If the deal goes ahead, it will be structured as a takeover of privately owned Gala Coral by its bigger rival, the publicly listed Ladbrokes. The combined company would then apply to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have fallen back at the start of the trading week with the usual worries to blame: the outlook for the UK after Brexit, uncertainties around the US election and the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates before the end of the year. With signs of tensions in the UK cabinet over Brexit discussions, the FTSE 100 has fallen back below 7000 and is currently 46.27 points lower at 6967.28, not helped for once by further weakness in the pound. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: After the positive move in European equities on Friday, markets are giving back some of those gains today, as attention turns to Janet Yellen, Mark Carney and the bond market. Both Yellen and Carney have been attempting to manage bond yields higher from their record lows of the summer. Talk of allowing the economy to run hot by \u201ctemporarily running a high pressure economy\u201d and being willing to \u201ctolerate a bit of an overshoot in inflation\u201d from Yellen and Carney respectively are having the desired effect in the short term as bond yields rise. However, the key questions are whether this strategy will herald the start of a prolonged bond market sell-off and if so, what effect this might have on other asset classes. Alongside the bond market, the other key theme dominating investor sentiment is US earnings, with a plethora of results due this week from companies including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Intel. With US markets close to record highs, the potential for surprises on the downside remains, even though expectations are low. Ahead of the US financial sector figures, banks are putting in a mixed performance, with Standard Chartered up 15p at 667.1p, Lloyds Banking Group 0.22p better at 52.65 but Royal Bank of Scotland slipping 2p to 170.8p. Education specialist Pearson is leading the market ower, down 74.5p at 758p after a disappointing update. Among the mid-caps Drax has jumped 8p to 319.3p after a positive note from Credit Suisse, which put an outperform rating and 425p price target (up from 415p) on the power company. The bank\u2019s analysts said: GB power has been volatile and is pricing in scarcity across the coming five months. Drax is the clearest beneficiary and we raise our 2016 and 2017 EBITDA estimates around 10% and around 13% respectively for increased near-term power prices and the value of gas hedges. Credit Suisse said an EU decision on whether to approve the UK\u2019s plans for state aid to help convert some of its plant to biomass could be imminent and would be crucial to the business: EC state aid approval on the contracts for difference is key (worth around 111p a share). It has been 286 days since the EC opened their investigation, and the two precedents were EDF\u2019s Hinkley Point and RWE\u2019s Lynemouth; approved after 294 and 285 days respectively. We expect a new dividend policy and investor day to follow any EC state aid approval. Elsewhere Ladbrokes has dipped 2.4p to 136.7p after agreeing to sell 359 shops as part of its merger with Gala Coral at a lower than expected \u00a355.5m. In a buy note Stifel said: The price achieved is lower than expected, but this transaction should enable the merger to occur before the end of October. But Davy analysts were less positive: The end is in sight! It is almost 15 months since Ladbrokes and Gala Coral announced the intention to merge, and the final major obstacle to that deal being completed has now been overcome with the announcement of the sale of 359 shops to BetFred and Stan James. The sale of these units was required by the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As such, Ladbrokes and Coral were effectively forced sellers of these units which immediately put them on the back foot when it came to negotiating a price. A shortage of viable bidders was also a factor given that the CMA insisted that the buyers have demonstrable experience in running such shops. That said, it would be wrong to entirely blame the 3.3 times EBITDA multiple on the factors above. The valuation undoubtedly also includes a discount for regulatory uncertainty ahead of the pending review of gaming machines in the UK. We continue to believe that the combined entity will be stronger than its individual parts and therefore are supportive of this merger. However, the mood music in relation to UK machines remains ominous. Better to wait and buy when there is regulatory certainty, in our view.",

      "bodyText": "The full extent of the difficulties Pearson is facing following the sale of the Financial Times to focus on education has been laid bare, as jittery investors sent its share price tumbling 10% after the company reported worse than expected sales. Pearson\u2019s chief executive, John Fallon, sold the FT in 2015, as well as its 50% stake in the publisher of the Economist, for more than \u00a31.3bn to focus on Pearson\u2019s educational publishing business. Fallon\u2019s predecessor Marjorie Scardino, who had tidied up Pearson\u2019s sprawling conglomerate by selling assets including Madame Tussauds and Alton Towers theme park, tenaciously defended the ownership of the FT, memorably declaring she would sell the business newspaper \u201cover my dead body\u201d. Pearson had owned the paper for 58 years. However, Fallon, the former head of Pearson\u2019s international education division promoted to run the company in 2013, had few qualms selling off what had become non-core assets in its strategy to focus on global education. Since then the world\u2019s largest educational publisher has found itself facing tough trading conditions, reporting that underlying sales fell 7% in the first nine nine months of the year, and 9% in North America, its biggest market. Pearson blamed sluggish demand for higher education textbooks in the US as well as a decline in its exam marking businesses in the UK and America. Pearson looked to allay negative sentiment about the revenues decline by reiterating its full-year financial guidance, and pointed to a boost from the strength of the US dollar against the pound since the Brexit vote. However, jittery investors focused on the issue of sales which fell short of analysts\u2019 forecasts of 5-6% decline. Pearson said sales trends had improved in September and October which, combined with cost cuts, enabled the company to stick with its forecast of adjusted operating profit of between \u00a3580m to \u00a3620m this year. \u201cWhile market conditions continue to be challenging, particularly in higher education, thanks to tight cost management we are on track to deliver our guidance this year and to achieve our long-term growth goal,\u201d said Fallon. The company added that if the pound continued to remain weak this year the earnings-per-share guidance range would increase by about 4.5p to 59.5p. Pearson, which still owns a minority stake in book giant Penguin Random House in a joint venture with German firm Bertelsmann, announced in January that it was cutting 4,000 jobs. The company said 90% of those losses, which account for 10% of its global workforce, were complete. The cuts, which will incur a \u00a3320m restructuring bill this year, were announced after the company issued two profit warnings in three months. Pearson said as a result of the \u201csimplification\u201d programme the company would save \u00a3350m a year. Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi, said Pearson\u2019s results were a mixed bag for investors. \u201cThe good news is that Pearson has reiterated its 2016 and 2018 guidance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bad news is that while guidance has been reiterated, the third-quarter organic growth was -7% at group level and -9% in North America.\u201d Pearson is expected to sell off its 47% stake in Penguin Random House, the world\u2019s largest book publisher spanning titles including Fifty Shades of Grey, The Girl on the Train and Pippa Middleton and Nigella Lawson\u2019s recipe and craft books, next year. A sale of the business, which makes about \u00a3400m in profits and is valued at more than \u00a32.3bn, would mark Pearson\u2019s final exit from its once considerable non-education focused publishing empire. If the partnership with Bertlesmann were to reach five years \u2013 the joint venture deal was completed in 2013 \u2013 the companies have the option to sell shares in Penguin Random House in an initial public offering. Pearson held a conference call with analysts to explain its rationale for continuing to expect to hit full year financial expectations despite deteriorating sales. Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum, said that it was an \u201cunconvincing call that will raise more doubts\u201d. Whittaker said the group\u2019s 7% decline in revenues was \u201cunlikely\u201d to recover in the final quarter of the year. \u201cTheir attempt to put the blame for US higher education weakness on bookstores\u2019 changing their buying patterns were not convincing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd their explanations as to why things will get better sound unconvincing.\u201d Liberum compared the financial performance and strategy of Pearson as akin to that of newspaper publishers, ironic given the company\u2019s recent exit from the newspaper market. \u201cPearson will resemble more and more the newspaper stocks, which are meeting earnings numbers by cost savings but seeing significant top-line declines,\u201d said Whittaker. \u201c[The trading update] is more evidence for Pearson being the \u2018new newspapers\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Biffa, the waste management company, has cut the price of its flotation due to market nerves caused by worries over the economic impact of Brexit. Britain\u2019s second biggest disposer and recycler of waste said it would raise \u00a3262m before costs by selling new shares at 180p each. The initial public offering (IPO) of 47.2% of the company will value Biffa at \u00a3450m. When Biffa announced plans to float last month it was reported to be seeking a market valuation of about \u00a31bn. But last week the company failed to get investor support for a sale at 220-270p a share, which would have valued it up to \u00a3675m. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the outlook for UK companies amid worries about Britain\u2019s economic prospects, the plunging value of the pound and the government\u2019s confrontational stance over Brexit. Biffa and its owners, including private equity fund Bain Capital, were said to be determined to push the float through, suggesting they did not think markets would revive soon. Biffa, which has an annual turnover of \u00a3927.5m and employs more than 7,000 people, works for many local authorities. It collects, processes and disposes of 6.6m tonnes of waste and recyclables for more than 95% of UK postcodes and 2.4 million households. The company announced its intention to float a month ago amid signs of a revival in the market for flotations, which froze in the first half of this year as companies waited for the result of the EU referendum held on 23 June. But several companies have since cancelled or shelved IPOs, including the fitness chain Pure Gym, which scrapped plans to raise \u00a3190m on 11 October. TI Fluid Systems, a maker of car parts, and the energy provider First Utility have also pulled their planned floats. The flotation will mark a return to the stock market for Biffa after it was bought by a group of private equity firms in 2008 in one of the last big buyouts as the financial crisis grew. The company, which was part of Severn Trent until 2006, was taken over by its lenders in 2012 to save it from collapse. Ian Wakelin, Biffa\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cA return to the London Stock Exchange is a significant milestone for Biffa and a testament to the hard work of all our staff. This listing is an endorsement of Biffa\u2019s business model, strategy, track record and prospects.\u201d Biffa said the UK waste market was expected to grow 5% a year until 2020 as the population and number of households increase. Additional rules requiring separate collections and treatment of waste items would also lead to more business, it said. Conditional trading of the shares will start on Monday. Biffa said it expected to pay \u00a319.6m in fees to advisers on the flotation and \u00a316.8m for management incentives and other costs.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s union movement has set itself on a collision course with the federal Labor party, calling for a rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement which Labor supports in principle. The Australian Council of Trade Unions appeared before the joint standing committee on treaties on Monday, which is reviewing the TPP. It called on the Turnbull government to reject the TPP, claiming independent economic analyses showed the trade deal could destroy 39,000 direct jobs in Australia by 2025. The TPP is the biggest global trade deal in 20 years, involving 12 countries in the Pacific region that collectively represent more than 40% of world gross domestic product. It involves Australia, the US, New Zealand and Japan, among other countries, and will ensure the US\u2019s influence in the region in the face of a growing China \u2013 if ratified. Belinda Tkalcevic, the ACTU\u2019s director of policy, told members of the committee the World Bank had found the economic benefits of the TPP would be \u201cnegligible\u201d. She said recent research from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development also showed the TPP would increase economic inequality. She said the ACTU did not support the deal, just like it did not support the China-Australia free-trade deal. \u201cThe TPP puts globalisation before Australian workers, threatens the fundamentals of our democracy and drives up health costs,\u201d Tkalcevic said. \u201cBy destroying thousands of Australian jobs and driving down wages we believe the TPP will lead to higher levels of inequality. \u201cThe TPP is a toxic combination of more power to multinationals ahead of democracy and globalisation ahead of Australian workers.\u201d The ACTU is the peak body for Australian unions, made up of 46 affiliated unions and representing more than 1.6m workers. However, Labor has said it does not support the inclusion of the investor state dispute settlement provision in the TPP, marking a sticking point with the government. Jason Clare, the shadow minister for trade, made this distinction clear on Monday. \u201cLabor recognises the potential benefits for Australia from the TPP, including increased market access for our goods and services,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe TPP could be a stepping stone to closer economic engagement across the Asia-Pacific \u2013 a goal Labor has pursued from establishing Apec to releasing the Australia in the Asian Century white paper. \u201c[But] Labor has insisted that no element of the TPP should affect the cost and availability of medicines for Australians. \u201cLabor [also] does not support the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions in any trade agreement, including the TPP.\u201d In June this year, Labor said if it won the election it would try to remove investor-state dispute settlement clauses from every trade agreement, and every bilateral investment treaty, that Australia has signed. It meant Labor would have reviewed three major trade agreements concluded by the Abbott-Turnbull governments \u2013 with China, South Korea and the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 that have ISDS provisions.",
