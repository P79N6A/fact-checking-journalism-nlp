Overall shop prices \u2013 including both food and non-food \u2013 fell by 1.7% in April compared with a year earlier. That was the same rate of deflation as in March, according to the BRC-Nielsen shop price index. The BRC chief executive described the three-year milestone as an \u201cimportant anniversary for retailers and shoppers alike\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen three years of falling shop prices,\u201d Helen Dickinson said. \u201cThe 36 consecutive months of price falls is being driven by intense competition across the industry. It has knock-on implications for margins and profitability given the combination of continued investment in digital and rising cost pressures.\u201d Excluding food, prices dropped 2.9% in April compared with a year earlier. Within that clothing and footwear prices slumped 7.1% amid heavy discounting to clear last season\u2019s fashions. The drop in non-food prices was an acceleration of the 2.6% fall recorded in March, with canny shoppers also able to find bargains in electrical, furniture and floor-coverings stores. Non-food prices have fallen for the past for 37 months. It was a different picture in food, where prices started to climb in April, up 0.1% compared with the 0.4% decline of the previous two months. With supermarkets cutting the price of fruit, vegetables and meat to win shoppers the cost of fresh foods fell by 0.5%, albeit a slowdown from the 0.9% decline seen in March. However, the price of ambient lines continued to rise, up 1.0% from a 0.4% rise in March. \u201cWhile some food prices have stabilised this month, this is partly due to external factors, and will probably be short term,\u201d said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen. \u201cThe underlying trend in shop prices is downwards with continued price cutting by supermarkets which is driving deflation.\u201d Fashion retailers have had a poor year so far as the mild winter put a dampener on sales of high-margin winter gear. The new season has also got off to a slow start because of the cool weather. Analysts say there are too many mouths to feed on a high street battling the growth of online retailers while staff costs are rising due to the national living wage. The strength of the US currency last year also created a squeeze because retailers buy many garments in dollars but sell them in sterling. Next is due to update the City on first-quarter trading on Wednesday. RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain predicted like-for-like sales at its stores would be down at least 3% with sales from its Directory catalogue arm also slightly lower. The tough conditions mean retailers might have to go even further to drum up business, Watkins said. \u201cThe cool spring has impacted the sales of many retailers, and an increase in the levels of promotion over the next few weeks to drive footfall is not out of the question,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Wonga\u2019s losses are expected to almost double after a slump in revenues at the payday lender following price caps imposed by the City regulator. The results, due to be announced on Wednesday, appear to raise questions about the success of the company\u2019s attempts to reinvent itself in the tougher regulatory environment, as it tries to shrug off past controversies over its business practices. Last year Wonga was ordered to pay more than \u00a32.6m compensation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for \u201cunfair and misleading debt collection practices\u201d, after it was found to have sent threatening letters to customers from non-existent law firms. In 2012 the Office of Fair Trading told it to clean up its act after it sent letters to customers accusing them of fraud. On Tuesday Sky News reported that Wonga would post a pre-tax loss of about \u00a370m in 2015, compared with \u00a337m a year earlier. The results will also show a sharp decline in Wonga\u2019s revenues from \u00a3215m in 2014, the channel said. The company declined to comment. The numbers come after a year in which Wonga and other payday lenders have been forced to operate under tighter regulations. Last year interest and fees on all high-cost short-term credit loans were capped at a daily rate of 0.8% of the amount borrowed. Meanwhile, if borrowers do not repay their loans on time, default charges must not exceed \u00a315, while the total cost including fees and interest is capped at 100% of the original sum. According to the FCA, which introduced the rules, this means no borrower will pay back more than twice the amount they borrowed. The move followed a string of criticisms levelled at the sector amid allegations of unscrupulous practices and customers running up huge debts. Wonga \u2013which recruited Andy Haste, a former boss of RSA insurance group, to clean up its image in 2014 \u2013 has said it wants to move its business away from the short-term lending that made its name, but also made it the focus of public anger. \u201cWonga has understandably faced criticism and we know we need to repair our reputation and regain our right to be an accepted part of the financial service sector,\u201d Haste said when he took on the \u00a3500,000-a-year job. However, the scale of the turnaround facing Haste is illustrated by the latest figures, which take Wonga\u2019s losses for the past two financial years to more than \u00a3100m. In the two years before that, the company made a profit of \u00a339.7m in 2013 and \u00a384.5m in 2012.",

In areas as wide-ranging as the prohibition of GM food, the abolition of the EU process of chemical safety based on the precautionary principle, and the ban on cosmetic testing on animals, US demands go right to the heart of our systems of environmental protection.

Greens have been leading the fight against TTIP and are determined to keep our country a part of the EU so that we can defeat TTIP together. This treaty cannot be pushed through without the agreement of the European parliament or all 28 EU members. There is huge momentum to stop TTIP across Europe and 3.5 million EU citizens have signed a petition calling for the deal to be abandoned. UK campaigners have played a vital role in the fight against TTIP, so leaving the EU would only weaken these efforts. We now need the Labour party to join the fight against TTIP.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The bookies took a right old caning on Leicester City, right? Don\u2019t believe a word of it. The part of the tale that is correct is that the Foxes\u2019 triumph, at odds that started the season at 5,000-1, ensured a loss for most bookmakers on the thin market in predicting the outright winner of the Premier League. William Hill, for example, is paying out \u00a33m for a net loss of \u00a32.2m. But note just how thin that market is. Betting, for most punters, is a game of instant gratification, and a full Premier League season, running 38 games and lasting nine months, rarely brings out big money. William Hill took less than \u00a31m in bets and would expect to see more activity in Premier League games on any given weekend. So Leicester\u2019s success, and bigger clubs\u2019 failures, were excellent news for the bookies on most of the 36 weekends so far. Chelsea\u2019s horrendous early-season form was a gift because too many winning favourites \u2013 especially when part of accumulator bets \u2013 are what the bookies really fear. The bottom line is that it has been an excellent football season for those setting the odds. Just don\u2019t expect the bookies to say so \u2013 shouting about losses is good marketing. Besides, every die-hard fan of a long-odds club will now want a \u201cjust in case\u201d flutter. The bookies can also see them coming: never again, one suspects, will 5,000-1 be offered on any team. HSBC\u2019s shareholders cannot relax yet It is a modern banking rarity, at least for HSBC: a quarter without a single charge for what the industry euphemistically calls \u201clegacy\u201d issues. There was nothing for US litigation, market shenanigans or even that old favourite, payment protection insurance. Shareholders cannot relax, however. First, the US Department for Justice\u2019s monitor is still prowling the premises and, at the last time of asking a few months ago, did not sound impressed by the bank\u2019s progress in overhauling systems to combat financial crime. Second, the other legacy of the banking crisis is a vastly different capital and trading climate; HSBC\u2019s current \u201cprogressive\u201d \u2013 meaning upwards only \u2013 dividend policy may become an unaffordable luxury. For the time being, HSBC can point out that the year is still young. \u201cWe need a fairly significant downward pressure on our earnings or a significant upward pressure on our regulatory capital requirements to affect our ability to meet our dividend commitment,\u201d argued finance director Iain Mackay. The trouble is, a first-quarter 14% fall in pretax profits to $6.1bn (\u00a34.2bn) is downward pressure of some significance. Yes, the equivalent period a year ago was strong; and, yes, wobbly markets in January and February didn\u2019t help. But if the first three months were \u201cresilient\u201d \u2013 the bank\u2019s spin \u2013 investors will wonder if HSBC\u2019s dividend can stand another spot of volatility. March and April were easier, but the world looks fundamentally riskier for a big bank reliant on global trade and with a heavy weighting to the east. Put simply, growth is harder to come by. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver has been cutting costs for most of his five years in the job, but the gains are becoming harder to secure \u2013 witness the uproar in the ranks over a salary freeze. On the plus side, the already-agreed $5bn sale of the Brazilian operation will boost capital ratios. On the negative, the need to refinance $70bn of bonds over the next three years could nibble at profit margins. In the end, though, the equation is simple: banks, like all mature companies, need their earnings to exceed their dividends by a comfortable margin. In 2015, HSBC\u2019s arithmetic was too tight for comfort \u2013 $0.51-a-share of dividends from $0.65-a-share of earnings \u2013 and now 2016 has started slowly. The message in that prospective dividend yield of 7.8%, and a share price close to its six-year low, is unmistakable: even if Gulliver doesn\u2019t take an axe to the dividend, his successor may. Eyes on the wheel, not the road The boss of one big motor insurer confessed privately a few months ago that he was mystified as to why his supposedly long-term shareholders never asked him about the threat that driverless cars present to his industry. He said he spends long hours trying to understand the possibilities of the technology, and had visited US developers to watch their trials at first-hand. But investors did not want to talk about the insurance implications. That sounds a reasonable assessment of a fund management industry where \u201clong term\u201d can mean \u201cnext year\u201d. Maybe the current outbreak of conferences on the subject will concentrate minds, but the truth is probably that nobody can make a reliable guess. Volvo estimates an 80% fall in car crashes by 2035, which sounds optimistic, but may be plausible. If it happens, it would presumably imply a steep fall in premiums and a much smaller insurance industry. For what it\u2019s worth, the chief executive took the view that \u201cif cars still have a steering wheel, I think we\u2019ll still have a business\u201d. That is reassuring for investors up to a point \u2013 but hardly narrows the range of possible outcomes.",

      "body": "<p>The bookies took a right old caning on Leicester City, right? Don\u2019t believe a word of it. The part of the tale that is correct is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/03/leicester-city-title-inside-story-premier-league-champions-claudio-ranieri\">the Foxes\u2019 triumph</a>, at odds that started the season at 5,000-1, ensured a loss for most bookmakers on the thin market in predicting the outright winner of the Premier League. William Hill, for example, is paying out \u00a33m for a net loss of \u00a32.2m.</p> <p>But note just how thin that market is. Betting, for most punters, is a game of instant gratification, and a full Premier League season, running 38 games and lasting nine months, rarely brings out big money. William Hill took less than \u00a31m in bets and would expect to see more activity in Premier League games on any given weekend.</p> <p>So Leicester\u2019s success, and bigger clubs\u2019 failures, were excellent news for the bookies on most of the 36 weekends so far. Chelsea\u2019s horrendous early-season form was a gift because too many winning favourites \u2013 especially when part of accumulator bets \u2013 are what the bookies really fear.</p> <p>The bottom line is that it has been an excellent football season for those setting the odds. Just don\u2019t expect the bookies to say so \u2013 shouting about losses is good marketing. Besides, every die-hard fan of a long-odds club will now want a \u201cjust in case\u201d flutter. The bookies can also see them coming: never again, one suspects, will 5,000-1 be offered on any team.</p> <h2>HSBC\u2019s shareholders cannot relax yet</h2> <p>It is a modern banking rarity, at least for HSBC: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/03/hsbc-profits-fall-14-as-global-volatility-hits-bottom-line\">a quarter</a> without a single charge for what the industry euphemistically calls \u201clegacy\u201d issues. There was nothing for US litigation, market shenanigans or even that old favourite, payment protection insurance.<br></p> <p>Shareholders cannot relax, however. First, the US Department for Justice\u2019s monitor is still prowling the premises and, at the last time of asking a few months ago, did not sound impressed by the bank\u2019s progress in overhauling systems to combat financial crime. Second, the other legacy of the banking crisis is a vastly different capital and trading climate; HSBC\u2019s current \u201cprogressive\u201d \u2013 meaning upwards only \u2013 dividend policy may become an unaffordable luxury.<br></p> <p>For the time being, HSBC can point out that the year is still young. \u201cWe need a fairly significant downward pressure on our earnings or a significant upward pressure on our regulatory capital requirements to affect our ability to meet our dividend commitment,\u201d argued finance director Iain Mackay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c22dcdcb4349a7208b0de58a60653ef0373c6579\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c22dcdcb4349a7208b0de58a60653ef0373c6579/0_214_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Yip/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trouble is, a first-quarter 14% fall in pretax profits to $6.1bn (\u00a34.2bn) is downward pressure of some significance.

      "bodyText": "As talks to broker a global trade deal entered a second tortuous decade, the US and the European Union came up with an idea. Since it was proving impossible to find agreement among the 150 or so members of the World Trade Organisation about how to tear down barriers to freer commerce, they would strike their own agreement. Talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) began in the summer of 2013 with officials in Washington and Brussels confident they could iron out any difficulties by the time American voters decide on who should succeed Barack Obama as president in November this year. This always looked a ridiculously tight timetable and so it has proved. Cutting trade deals is an agonisingly slow process. The last successful global deal \u2013 the Uruguay Round \u2013 took seven years before being concluding in 1993. Talks continued on the Doha Round from 2001 until 2015 before terminal boredom and frustration set in. Was it really feasible that TTIP could be pushed through in little more than three years? Not a chance. There are three reasons for that. First, the main barriers to trade between the US and the EU are not traditional tariff barriers, which have been steadily whittled away in the decades since the second world war, but the differing regulatory regimes that operate on either side of the Atlantic. America and Europe have different views on everything from GM food to safety standards on cars so harmonising standards was always going to take a lot of time. Second, the talks have involved controversial issues and have been taking place when trust in politicians and business has rarely been lower. The main driving forces behind TTIP have been multinational corporations and business lobby groups, who stand to gain from harmonised regulations. With information about the secret negotiations having to be chiselled out by groups hostile to TTIP, voters have drawn the obvious conclusion: the aim of the talks is to enrich big business even if it means playing fast and loose with environmental and health standards. Which leads to the final and most important factor: there are no votes in trade. It would have been no surprise had Angela Merkel voiced strong opposition to the state of the TTIP negotiations, given the level of public antipathy to the trade deal in Germany and her delicate position in the polls ahead of elections next year. Instead, the German chancellor was beaten to it by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande (also facing a showdown with the voters in 2017) who has made it clear he will not sign TTIP in its current form. Years not months of hard slog lie ahead, by which time the US is likely to have a president much less wedded to the idea of striking trade deals.

    "webTitle": "Gun manufacturer CEO says 'we are good citizens' as gun sales surge", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co, one of the largest gun manufacturers in the US, reported sales of $173.1m for the first quarter of 2016, up 26% from last year and some of the highest earnings in the company\u2019s 67-year history. At a shareholding meeting, executives said \u201cwe are good citizens\u201d and predicted that demand for guns could continue to grow thanks to the increasingly heated political rhetoric of the 2016 election, and a long-term trend of Americans wanting guns for self-defense. At $1.21 a share, earnings per share increased 49% from the first quarter of 2015. Sturm Ruger\u2019s first-quarter results included the second-highest revenue and third-highest earnings since it was founded in 1949. Sturm Ruger reported that firearm orders by gun shops increased in the past year, and listed sales to 18 federally licensed firearm wholesalers. In the first quarter, the unit sell-through of Sturm Ruger\u2019s products by its distributors to retailers increased 17% compared to 2015, and distributors\u2019 inventories decreased by 54,300 units overall. More than 99% of the company\u2019s net sales came from firearms. Just $1.5m came from sales of casting. During its annual meeting with shareholders, Sturm Ruger\u2019s CEO, Michael Fifer, described the company as an American manufacturer and \u201cgood citizen\u201d. \u201cWe make products in American factories. We pour metal. We cut wood. We assemble guns,\u201d he said, noting that the company\u2019s three gun factories in New Hampshire, Arizona and North Carolina employ more than 2,000 people. \u201cWe are basically an industrial manufacturer of great consumer products. We take pride in being an American manufacturer.\u201d \u201cWe pay our taxes and we keep our cash in the United States. There are no tax inversions or offshoring for us. We are good citizens,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe understand that manufacturing \u2013 the conversion of raw materials into something useful \u2013 is a core foundation of any successful economy, including ours.\u201d His comments coincide with increased pressure on the gun industry by the Democratic frontrunner for president, Hillary Clinton. Clinton has promised that if elected president she would attempt to close the loopholes that make gun manufacturers and gun sellers exempt from certain lawsuits related to gun deaths. A decade of growth Despite an increased demand for gun control, gun sales and gun production in the US have surged over the past decade. \u201cOur industry appears to have been growing overall during the past 10 years as the number of new shooters has steadily increased, as the demographics of new shooters have broadened and many states have embraced more favorable gun-rights laws,\u201d Fifer said. \u201cParticularly, concealed-carry laws.\u201d In the presentation to shareholders, Sturm Ruger officials noted that the average age of gun-owning Americans has decreased in recent years. While the average gun owner may be getting younger, many are no longer coming from gun-owning families and so are discovering guns on their own at a later age than before. \u201cWe see a lot more women shooters. We see more folks from urban and suburban areas, and we see fewer folks who hunted prior to their first purchase,\u201d explained Chris Killoy, president of Sturm Ruger. \u201cA lot of folks are getting started older. They weren\u2019t necessarily started in a shooting family or a hunting family. They got started a little later.\u201d Although the demand for guns has increased, the number of US households with guns has declined. In 2010 and 2014, about 31% of US households reported having a firearm, the lowest level of gun ownership in about 40 years. Yet from 2010 to 2013, the number of guns manufactured in the US has almost doubled going from 5.5m to 10.9m, according to the Department of Justice. As Fifer pointed out, fear about gun rights can drive up demand, as gun owners stock up on firearms. According to the Washington Post, in 2013 there were on average eight guns in a gun-owning household; that\u2019s up from four in 1994. Sales boost due to political rhetoric Fifer added that the American gun industry has experienced dramatic rises and falls, volatility that he attributed to political rhetoric and the press. Periods of demand are often followed by periods when buyers \u201cretreated as threats to gun rights failed to materialize\u201d. Back in February, Fifer predicted that the demand for guns would go up if Democrats won the Senate and if a Democrat were elected the next president. The most recent spike in demand was attributed to an increased desire for self-defense. Fifer explained that terrorist attacks are a boon to the industry, saying: \u201c2015 was a recovery year in the cycle, until very late in the year when we observed very significant demand. The spike in demand was strongly correlated to the tragic terrorist activities in Paris and San Bernardino.\u201d \u201cDemand for firearms for self-defense and concealed carry increased dramatically,\u201d he added, \u201cand that demand continued to the first quarter of 2016.\u201d Last year saw a record 23m background checks for gun purchases. Additionally, background checks for the first three months of 2016 have gone up 36% compared to last year. More than 7.6m background checks for gun purchases have been performed in January, February and March. Background checks are not the most accurate metric for determining sales, as not every background check results in purchase and multiple guns can be purchased with one background check. The demand, however, might be \u201cretreating\u201d once again. \u201cIn the past couple of weeks, there have been some early anecdotal hints that the spike in demand might be easing and that the normal seasonal pattern of demand might be taking hold,\u201d Fifer said. \u201cIt is, however, an election year, and the rhetoric from both sides is likely to continue keeping consumers aware and thinking about their firearms rights.\u201d According to Fifer\u2019s presentations to the shareholders, Sturm Ruger has the broadest product line in the industry, featuring \u201cfirearms that the average person can afford\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has ordered the insolvency watchdog to launch an immediate investigation into the circumstances surrounding BHS\u2019s slump into administration. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, instructed the Insolvency Service to consider the extent to which the conduct of the BHS directors led to its collapse into insolvency last week, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. The investigation will not only look at the role of the directors, led by Dominic Chappell of Retail Acquisitions, at the time when administrators were called in, but their predecessors, led by Sir Philip Green. \u201cI have asked the Insolvency Service to bring forward its investigation rather than wait three months for the administrators to report before launching their inquiry ... Any issues of misconduct will be taken very seriously,\u201d Javid said. The Insolvency Service intervention is the latest in a series of investigations into what happened at BHS. Two cross-party committees of MPs are also looking at the matter. On Tuesday, Green agreed to appear before an unusual joint session of the business, innovation and skills select committee and the work and pensions select committee. He is expected to go to parliament in mid June after the committees have taken evidence from other parties, including Chappell, pension trustees and the former BHS chairman Lord Grabiner. However, the committees said they had no plans to call Green\u2019s wife, Tina, to appear. The work and pensions committee inquiry will begin on Monday with evidence from the Pensions Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, the industry-backed body that is likely to have to make up BHS\u2019s pension deficit of \u00a3571m. The Serious Fraud Office is also reported to be examining the flow of money in and out of BHS after Green sold the business for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions more than a year ago. The SFO would neither confirm nor deny its interest in the matter. The Insolvency Service normally waits for the conclusion of a final report by administrators before commencing any investigation into a company. But the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d surrounding the BHS case meant that Javid wanted to commence the investigation as soon as possible. Should it conclude that one or more present or former directors had been involved in any misconduct, an application may be made to a court to ask that they be disqualified from acting as a director for a period of between two and 15 years, depending on the nature of their misconduct. If the conduct that leads to a disqualification took place after 1 October 2015 and caused a loss to creditors, an application could also be made to a court for compensation. Retail Acquisitions extracted more than \u00a325m of payments, including professional fees and loan interest, from BHS in the year before it entered administration with debts of \u00a31.3bn. The Guardian has revealed that the former racing driver Chappell could be forced to return millions of pounds paid to his consortium during its controversial 13-month ownership of BHS. The legal director of BHS has written to Chappell asking him for \u00a350,000 that was not repaid after he moved \u00a31.5m from the retailer to an obscure corporate vehicle in the days before its collapse. Meanwhile, BHS administrators are examining whether loans paid to Retail Acquisitions can be called in. Under Green\u2019s stewardship, more than \u00a3586m was extracted in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans by the Green family and other shareholders, including The Ivy restaurant owner, Richard Caring. Administrators are urgently negotiating with up to 10 potential buyers who are thought to be interested in taking on as many as 60 of BHS\u2019s 160-plus stores as a going concern. The interested parties include the Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, who has pledged to save all the jobs at risk, discount retailer B&amp;M, the Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner, Philip Day, the Co-op chairman Allan Leighton and the Preston-based property entrepreneur Yousuf Bhailok. Bidders have been given access to the BHS books this week and are expected to assess the information over the coming days before first round bids are tabled. Angela Eagle MP, shadow business secretary, said: \u201cFollowing days of pressure from the Labour party and the announcement last week of a joint select committee inquiry, this latest statement from the government on the BHS affair is very welcome. \u201cThe former owners took hundreds of millions of pounds out of the business, before leaving a pension black hole which is now estimated to be worth \u00a3571m. If the former owners acted inappropriately, we need to ensure that they pay their fair share of the deficit, rather than leaving the Pension Protection Scheme \u2013 and other pension funds \u2013 to pick up the bill.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UN has urged governments to stem the flow of funds to tax havens after companies funnelled $221bn (\u00a3152bn) into countries with low tax rates last year. The Netherlands and Luxembourg were among the top destinations for funds from corporations seeking to avoid tax, along with the US, Britain, Switzerland and Ireland, according to the UN. Two tax havens under UK jurisdiction, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and Cayman Islands, received $72bn of investment as they became a focus for businesses in Russia, China, the US and Hong Kong. Illustrating the extent of profit shifting to the Caribbean, the UN report found that a sample of companies in 26 developed countries registered more profits in Bermuda than they did in China in 2014. The findings come only weeks after David Cameron was forced to admit his family benefited from funds based in the BVI following the Panama Papers revelations. Since then Cameron has come under pressure to secure tougher disclosure agreements with British dependencies and crown protectorates in the Caribbean and the Channel islands to end the secrecy that campaigners believe supports profit shifting to avoid tax. Unctad (the UN Conference on Trade and Development) said the growing practice among multinational corporations of diverting profits to low tax jurisdictions denied vital investment funds to developing world countries. Company subsidiaries based in low-tax countries were booking profits that were \u201cout of line with economic fundamentals\u201d, it said. These funds were disguised as investment when they were more likely to be funds shuffled from one centre to another to avoid tax. \u201cThe persistence of investment flows routed through offshore finance centres, as well as the level of profits booked in these jurisdictions, highlight the pressing need to create greater coherence among tax and investment policies at the global level,\u201d it said. \u201cA lack of coordination between these two crucial policy areas will limit positive spillovers from one to the other, limiting potential gains in tax compliance as well as productive investment.\u201d The British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca was found in 2015 to have paid no tax on \u00a33bn of profits after channelling funds through a subsidiary in the Netherlands. The report said \u201cspecial purpose entities\u201d (SPEs) set up by companies were typically subsidiaries that had little connection to the local economy but held assets or liabilities or raised capital. Quarterly flows to SPEs in the Netherlands reached $148bn in the third quarter, the highest since 2007, driven by investment from Luxembourg and Britain. But this trend sharply reversed in the last quarter of 2015 after the Netherlands introduced a general avoidance regulation in line with new OECD rules being adopted across Europe and other developed countries. The clampdowns in the Netherlands and Luxembourg meant investment flows to offshore financial centres retreated from their recent high of $132bn in 2013, but remained \u201chigh\u201d and roughly in line with the flows of previous years. It meant the global total for the year fell back to $221bn. Flows to Luxembourg, typically destined for the subsidiaries of major US corporations, had surged in the first three quarters of 2015 to three times the level in the same months of 2014, but turned negative with a net divestment of $115bn in the final quarter. \u201cThe tight interrelation between SPE flows in Luxembourg and the Netherlands highlights the existence of dense and complex networks of these entities in both countries, with capital flowing rapidly among them in response to financing needs and tax planning considerations,\u201d the Unctad report said.",

      "bodyText": "A combination of downbeat factors - the raft of disappointing data from around the world, the EU cutting its growth forecasts, falling commodity prices thanks to weak Chinese numbers, a cut in Australian interest rates to boost flagging growth and a volatile day for the dollar - all combined to revive worries about the state of the global economy and sent stock markets sharply lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 56.30 points or 0.9% to 6185.59 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.94% to 9926.77 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.59% at 4371.98 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.46% to 17,966.81 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.85% lower at 8764.9 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 583.65 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 150 points or 0.8%. Elsewhere Brent crude is down 1.9% at $44.96 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Commenting on the JP Morgan global survey, Capital Economics said: Manufacturing activity seems to have remained weak across the board at the start of the second quarter. Markit\u2019s global manufacturing PMI, released today, slipped from 50.6 in March to 50.1 in April, extending a downward trend which began in 2013. On past form, it is now consistent with global growth of only around 2%. A number of factors have led to today\u2019s market sell-off, including weak economic data and a volatile dollar. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Woeful economic news and weak bank earnings put stock market bears in charge on Tuesday. Weak manufacturing data from China and the UK, downgraded forecasts for UK and Eurozone growth as well as the Reserve Bank of Australia cutting interest rates to ward off deflation all point to a weaker economic outlook. US stocks slumped on the open with the Dow Jones losing over 200 points after weak auto sales number added to a weak economic outlook in China, the UK and Europe. The day started with new multi-month lows for the dollar index and corresponding highs in the euro, British pound and the yen. But dollar losses were reversed after the Fed\u2019s Dennis Lockhart suggesting June was a \u2018live meeting\u2019 triggered short-covering at oversold levels. Global manufacturing growth slipped in April, according to the latest JPMorgan and Markit survey. The global manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index came in at 50.1 in April, down from 50.6 in March and only just above the 50 level which separates growth from contraction. The reading is the second weakest in the past forty months. David Hensley, director of global economic coordination at J.P.Morgan, said: The latest PMI data indicate global manufacturing output is growing at an anemic pace, similar to the past year. What is notable is the sharp drop in the PMI finished goods inventory index. Once manufacturers have aligned inventories with sales, faster production gains should ensue. Markets continue to come under pressure. with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 178 points or just over 1%. Here are the biggest movers in the index: The latest New York manufacturing survey showed business activity growing at its fastest pace since December last year. But there was a drop in the six-month outlook in April to a seven year low. The Institute for Supply Management index rose from 50.4 in March to 57 but the six month outlook fell to 53.1. The ISM said the drop in outlook \u201cshould raise a caution flag.\u201d As expected, and in line with other global markets, Wall Street is on the slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 134 points or 0.75% in early trading, as fears about the global economy re-emerge. Poor manufacturing data from the US on Monday, and China and the UK today, have unsettled investors, along with the news that Australia\u2019s central bank cut interest rates to help support growth. The S&amp;P opened 0.4% lower while Nasdaq is down 0.7%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is currently 0.65% lower, Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 1.68% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 1.2%. The US could raise interest rates twice this year, following December\u2019s increase, but there were a number of uncertainties including whether Britain votes to leave the European Union. That is the view of Atlanta Federal Reserve president Dennis Lockhart. Speaking to reporters in Florida he said two hikes were possible, but it depended on how the economy evolved. He said (quote from Reuters): It is the repercussions [of a Brexit vote] for the US economy that would concern me....it\u2019s really a question of indications in the financial markets of a reaction to rising uncertainty and the degree of volatility we are seeing again in financial markets. But he added that the markets should put more probability on June being \u201ca real option\u201d for a rise. Indeed the dollar is currently weaker after Monday\u2019s disappointing US manufacturing data suggested no imminent rate rise. Never let it be said that government ministers can\u2019t learn from their mistakes. Britain\u2019s business secretary, Sajid Javid, has postponed a trade delegation to Iran so he can focus on the UK steel crisis. The trip had been billed as Britain\u2019s biggest ever trade mission to Iran, giving UK companies a chance to cash in develop business opportunities following the lifting of sanctions. But it\u2019s been put on ice, until the future of Britain\u2019s steel industry is resolved. A spokesman told Reuters: \u201cGiven the Business Secretary\u2019s focus on the steel industry,he has decided to postpone his trip to Iran. He remains committed to exploring the opportunities for trade and investment with this emerging market and an alternative date will be arranged in due course.\u201d Tata UK wants potential buyers to register their interest in its steel operations this week, so Javid\u2019s decision may indicate that progress is being made. One company, Liberty House, has already thrown its hard hat into the ring: Alternatively, Javid may be desperate to avoid a repeat of his infamous Australia trip - which left him on the far side of the world when Tata announced it was selling up. It\u2019s an old City motto, to \u201csell in May and go away\u201d. The theory is to cash in your gains once the May Day morris dancers have done their thing. Then, sit tight until the horses competing at the St Leger Stakes in early September have been rubbed down and fed a few sugar lumps It doesn\u2019t always pay off - although it worked rather well last year, when the FTSE 100 hit a record high in April, only to shed 12% by the end of August. So perhaps that\u2019s one reason that investors are reacting badly to today\u2019s disappointing economic data. The selloff in European markets has gathered pace, with Germany\u2019s DAX now down around 1.7%. And the FTSE is still at a three-week low, currently down 75 points. Mining stocks are suffering from concerns over the global economy, with Anglo American shedding 10%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the decline in the US dollar is hitting European shares, as eurozone companies benefit from a weaker euro, not a stronger one. The foreign exchange markets are taking centre stage today, as incessant US dollar selling has brought about an 18-month low in the US dollar-Japanese yen rate, an eight month high in the euro-US dollar rate, and a four-month high for the pound against the US dollar. With IG clients currently seeing a 71% chance of the UK remaining in the EU, it is clear traders are heavily betting that the late February low of $1.3836 represents the bottom for GBP/USD. Banking shares are also suffering, after Germany\u2019s Commerzbank reported that its net profits had halved in the last quarter. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, has warned that today\u2019s grim UK factory data could herald more bad new... \u201cManufacturing output in April recorded a shocking reading dropping to the lowest point since the throes of the euro-zone crisis in March 2013. The tailwinds afflicting the manufacturing sector \u2013 concerns around the health of the global economy, uncertainty surrounding the result of June\u2019s EU referendum and evidence of a broad slowdown in activity in the UK \u2013 means that the \u2018makers\u2019 will struggle to avoid a repeat in Q2 of the decline in output seen in the first three months of the year. \u201cThe detail of the survey offered further causes for pessimism. Both the consumer and investment goods sectors registered declines in output, while survey respondents highlighted a weakening in both domestic and overseas demand. In addition, export orders dropped for the fourth month in a row, while jobs in the sector fell at the fastest rates since February 2013.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story on the downturn in UK manufacturing: America\u2019s stock market is expected to fall when it opens in three hours time, following today\u2019s disappointing news from China and the UK. The EC has also predicted another year of recession in Greece, with its GDP shrinking by 0.3%. We all want Greece to find growth again, and create jobs particularly for its young people, says commissioner Mosocovici. In contrast, Ireland is expected to post the strongest growth this year: European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has challenged Europe\u2019s politicians to do more to stimulate growth: He says: Growth in Europe is holding up despite a more difficult global environment. \u201cThe recovery in the euro area remains uneven, both between Member States and between the weakest and the strongest in society. That is unacceptable and requires determined action from governments, both individually and collectively. Today\u2019s forecasts assume that the British public vote to remain in the EU, the Commisison says: In another blow, the European Commission has just cut its forecast for UK growth this year. The EC now expects Britain\u2019s economy to expand by just 1.8% this year, down from a previous forecast of 2.1%, inching up to 1.9% in 2017. It blames the uncertainty created by June\u2019s EU referendum -- echoing the slump in UK factory output. The commission says: \u201cRisks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, reflecting less favourable external demand and uncertainty in the lead-up to the June referendum. Net exports are forecast to continue to detract from growth although less markedly in 2017.\u201d But Britain isn\u2019t alone. The EC has also cut its forecast for eurozone growth, despite the bloc posting better-than-expected GDP figures last Friday. It now expects eurozone growth of 1.6% this year (down from 1.7%) and 1.8% in 2017 (down from 1.9%). And it has also admitted that its previous inflation forecasts were too optimistic - predicting that prices will only rise by 0.2% this year. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, agrees that the Brexit referendum is partly to blame for the slump in UK manufacturing: \u201cThe sharp drop to a three year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home. These chart shows how UK factories have weakened in the last few months: The shock slump in UK factory activity last month is a serious sign, warns David Noble of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. Noble says an \u201catmosphere of deep unease\u201d is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, as new orders and exports come under pressure. He also cites the recent collapse of high street chain BHS as proof that economic conditions are worsening. \u201cA sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum. In a month that saw the collapse of BHS, the troubles in the British High Street are being felt just as keenly in Britain\u2019s factories. Manufacturers are compensating for stalling new order growth by depleting their stocks, and dramatically cutting the amount of raw materials they buy from suppliers. Noble is also concerned that large factories cut jobs last month: The sector is nervously waiting to see whether this is a temporary blip or the beginning of a more pervasive slow down. UK factories slashed jobs last month at the fastest rate since February 2013, led by major manufacturers. Markit explains: The downturn at manufacturers was reflected in the labour market at the start of the second quarter. Job cuts were reported for the fourth successive month, with the rate of decline the fastest since February 2013. Losses were mainly centred on large-sized companies, as SMEs recorded (on average) a further increase in workforce numbers. Breaking! Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has suffered its worst performance in three years. Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has slumped to 49.2 in April, down from 50.7 in March It\u2019s the first time since March 2013 that the PMI has fallen below the 50-point mark, which separates expansion from contraction. British companies are suffering a double-whammy, with domestic demand softening and new orders from overseas falling too. Markit reports that new export orders fell for the fourth straight month in April, as global economic growth continued to slow. Rob Dobson, economist at Markit, says that June\u2019s EU referendum is partly to blame too: \u201cManufacturers are emphasising slower domestic demand growth and declining new export orders as the key weaknesses they are facing, amid rising uncertainty about the global economy, the oil &amp; gas industry, retail sector and the EU referendum. With this backdrop unlikely to change in the coming months, the second quarter is likely to remain a bleak landscape for industry.\u201d More details and reaction to follow.... The British pound is on a tear this morning, hitting its highest level against the US dollar since last December. Sterling has gained almost one cent to $1.4758, a level last seen in mid-December before Brexit fears began to bite. It appears that the pound has been recovering because City traders expect Britain to vote to remain in the EU on June 23, even though recent polls have suggested a tight fight. But the pound isn\u2019t alone -- the dollar is weakening against all the major currencies this morning (apart from the Australia dollar, of course). The London stock market has now hit its lowest level since early April, as traders begin May with a bout of selling. Europe\u2019s stock markets have all fallen in the first hour of trading. London\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 35 points at 6208, dragged down by those falling mining stocks. Germany\u2019s DAX has shed 1.5%, and France\u2019s CAC is down 0.8%. Shares are being hit because the euro has strengthened against the US dollar this morning. Mining stocks are sliding this morning, pulling London\u2019s stock market into the red. The miners are suffering from falling commodity prices, after today\u2019s weak Chinese factory data. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: Once again commodity stocks are taking a toll with Anglo American leading the pack lower, with a slide in oil prices during yesterday\u2019s session instrumental here. The Japanese yen has just hit an 18-month high against the US dollar, in another blow to the country\u2019s exporters. Investors are piling into the yen after the Japanese central bank disappointed investors last week by not boosting its stimulus programme. That\u2019s going to worry policymakers in Toyko, who are gunning for a weaker currency to help get inflation moving. Over in the City, HSBC shares have jumped 3% in early trading as investors show relief that profits have \u2018only\u2019 fallen by 14%. Just Eat, the online takeaway ordering company, have soared by almost 7% after it reported a 41% surge in sales and hiked its profit forecasts. But Aberdeen Asset Management is still struggling from the slowdown in emerging markets. It reported a 40% slump in underlying pre-tax profits this morning, sending its shares down 6% in early trading. Australia\u2019s interest rate cut will fuel fears of another round of \u2018currency wars\u2019 as nations fight for the competitive edge of a weaker currency, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Australia\u2019s stock market has hit a six-month high following today\u2019s interest rate cut. The S&amp;P/ASX jumped 2%, as investors welcomed the promise of cheaper money (even though it was driven by deflation fears). The Australian dollar suffered a predictable selloff, slumping by 1.5% against the US dollar to $0.756. There\u2019s no let-up in the pain gripping China\u2019s factories. The latest healthcheck of the sector shows that activity fell again last month. Total new orders stagnated and new export orders shrinking for the fifth month in a row. Data firm Caixin also reports that Chinese firms cut jobs, in the face of weakening demand for their products. Overall employment declined again, with the rate of job shedding nearly as sharp as in February\u2019s, when it hit a post-global financial crisis record. This drove Caixin\u2019s Chinese manufacturing PMI down to 49.4, from 49.7, on an index where anything below 50 shows a contraction. Dr. He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group, fears that the Chinese economy could be heading into dangerous waters: \u201cAll of the index\u2019s categories indicated conditions worsened month-on-month, with output slipping back below the 50-point neutral level. The fluctuations indicate the economy lacks a solid foundation for recovery and is still in the process of bottoming out. The government needs to keep a close watch on the risk of a further economic downturn.\u201d Australia has fired another shot in the currency battles by unexpectedly cutting interest rates to fresh record lows. The Reserve Bank of Australia blamed lower inflation, a stronger Aussie dollar and signs of weakness in its jobs market, as it slashed borrowing costs to just 1.75%, down from 2%. It\u2019s the latest sign that economic conditions remain weak, forcing central bankers to ease policy in an attempt to spur demand and ward off another financial crisis. The move also sparked a political row, as my colleague Paul Karp explains: Shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the interest rate decision reflected the Liberal government\u2019s incredibly poor economic management. He said in August 2013 when interest rates were cut to 2.5% the Coalition seized on it as a sign of economic weakness. \u201cThis decision reflects a weaker economic outlook, with the RBA expecting growth to moderate this year,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, incomes are falling, living standards are stagnating and home ownership is out of reach for so many Australians \u2013 facts the government will be hiding from tonight.\u201d In question time, Malcolm Turnbull responded to claims the rate cut demonstrated a softening economy by promising the budget would help manage a transition away from an economy reliant on the mining sector, and deliver jobs and growth. Here\u2019s the full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders in London are struggling back to their desks after the long weekend, and wondering whether the advice to \u201csell in May and go away\u201d holds firm this year. So they\u2019ll be watching the latest UK manufacturing data, due at 9.30am, for signs that the British economy is slowing down in the run-up to June\u2019s EU referendum. Yesterday, Germany and Italy reported a pick-up in factory growth, but France bucked the trend with another contraction. HSBC, the global bank, has already given investors something to ponder. It has just reported a 14% slide in profits following the stock market turmoil at the start of 2016. Our City editor Jill Treanor has studied the numbers, and explains: Profits at HSBC fell in the first three months of the year after Britain\u2019s biggest bank was knocked by the volatility that gripped global markets in January and February. Statutory pre-tax profits in the three-months to the end of March fell 14% to $6.1bn, which the bank described as \u201ca resilient performance despite challenging market conditions\u201d. If currency movements and other one-off items were excluded profits fell 18% to $5.4bn. Stuart Gulliver, the bank\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cMarket uncertainty led to extreme levels of volatility in January and February, which affected our ability to generate revenue in our markets and wealth management businesses. However, our diversified, universal-banking business model helped to cushion the impact through growth in other parts of the bank\u201d. Time is running out for potential bidders to express interest in Tata Steel\u2019s UK operations, including its famous blast furnace at Port Talbot in Wales. One firm, Liberty House, has already revealed it will bid.... At 10am UK time the European Commission releases its latest economic forecasts.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "About one in four owners of premium cars would buy a self-driving vehicle, according to Volvo\u2019s chief executive, who has vowed to make the technology affordable. H\u00e5kan Samuelsson said Volvo had had a deluge of interest in its \u201cDrive me\u201d trial in London next year, when 100 drivers will test its new autonomous driving technology on motorways and major roads. The Swedish carmaker plans to start selling vehicles equipped with the technology as early as 2020. Volvo will test the technology in Gothenburg this year. It is also looking into conducting a trial in China, where congestion and road safety are major issues. Speaking at a seminar on self-driving cars in London, Samuelsson said: \u201cA quarter of customers for premium cars would be very interested in the autopilot function.\u201d He added that the technology would be affordable. \u201cIt\u2019s not a product where you have to rely on subsidies.\u201d With industry experts estimating that 90% of road accidents are caused by human error, Samuelsson said the technology \u201cwill save lives and reduce congestion\u201d. He predicted \u201csubstantial benefits to society\u201d, with less time wasted by drivers sat in traffic. \u201cConference calls could be done in the car \u2013 it\u2019s an extension of office hours,\u201d Samuelsson said. \u201cPeople will be able to use their time better. You can read your mails, watch a movie or just relax.\u201d However, this does not mean that driving licences will become a thing of the past. Samuelsson expects drivers to switch to autopilot when appropriate \u2013 for example, when they drive on the motorway. James Dalton, head of the Association of British Insurers, said drivers would still have to be fully qualified, competent and sober. \u201cI can\u2019t see a scenario in the next 25 years where a driver gets into a car drunk and gets emailing on the way home. I don\u2019t think the average consumer will accept that.\u201d He drew a parallel with an aircraft being flown on autopilot, with a human pilot sitting in the cockpit, ready to take over should something go wrong. He added: \u201cThe challenges of driving in London are very different from driving in rural Worcestershire.\u201d Volvo pointed to US government research predicting that self-driving cars will lead to an 80% fall in the number of car crashes by 2035. Samuelsson also referred to a 2014 study that estimated a saving equivalent to 2% of US GDP, or more than $400bn, in lower yearly accident-related costs if all cars were self-driving. Car insurance premiums are also expected to fall, resulting in a financial hit to the insurance industry, which admitted it would have to adapt to what Volvo described as a \u201cseismic\u201d change. Younger male drivers, who currently pay the highest premiums, stand to benefit. Tim Marlow, head of autonomous &amp; connected vehicle research at insurer Ageas in the UK, said: \u201cAutonomy flattens risk.\u201d Marlow said insurers would have to move from a fault-based, or tort liability, system in which companies pay according to each party\u2019s degree of fault, to a product liability system. Data recorders will help establish whether the vehicle technology or the driver is to blame in the event of an accident. Dalton said this would be a big change for insurers, but also for car manufacturers, which would have to be adequately capitalised to pay out claims that could run into the tens of millions of pounds. Experts said customers expected a streamlined claims process and warned that if a manufacturer went to court, it could take years to settle a claim. Analysts said specialist motor insurers such as Admiral and RAC were under threat and would have to diversify into other areas such as home and pet cover. Dalton said: \u201cThe insurance industry has been around since the 16th century. It has dealt with the emergence of ships and aircraft and it will deal with the emergence of self-driving cars. It\u2019s a challenge and there will be a change but we are ready for it.\u201d",

Samuelsson also referred to a 2014 study that estimated a saving equivalent to 2% of US GDP, or more than $400bn, in lower yearly accident-related costs if all cars were self-driving.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/03/driverless-cars-dent-motor-insurers-volvo\">Car insurance premiums are also expected to fall</a>, resulting in a financial hit to the insurance industry, which admitted it would have to adapt to what Volvo described as a \u201cseismic\u201d change.</p> <p>Younger male drivers, who currently pay the highest premiums, stand to benefit. Tim Marlow, head of autonomous &amp; connected vehicle research at insurer Ageas in the UK, said: \u201cAutonomy flattens risk.\u201d</p> <p>Marlow said insurers would have to move from a fault-based, or tort liability, system in which companies pay according to each party\u2019s degree of fault, to a product liability system. Data recorders will help establish whether the vehicle technology or the driver is to blame in the event of an accident. </p> <p>Dalton said this would be a big change for insurers, but also for car manufacturers, which would have to be adequately capitalised to pay out claims that could run into the tens of millions of pounds.</p> <p>Experts said customers expected a streamlined claims process and warned that if a manufacturer went to court, it could take years to settle a claim.</p> <p>Analysts said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/03/driverless-cars-dent-motor-insurers-volvo\">specialist motor insurers such as Admiral and RAC were under threat</a> and would have to diversify into other areas such as home and pet cover.</p> <p>Dalton said: \u201cThe insurance industry has been around since the 16th century. It has dealt with the emergence of ships and aircraft and it will deal with the emergence of self-driving cars. It\u2019s a challenge and there will be a change but we are ready for it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Doubts about the controversial EU-US trade pact are mounting after the French president threatened to block the deal. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said on Tuesday he would reject the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership \u201cat this stage\u201d because France was opposed to unregulated free trade. Earlier, France\u2019s lead trade negotiator had warned that a halt in TTIP talks \u201cis the most probable option\u201d. Matthias Fekl, the minister responsible for representing France in TTIP talks, blamed Washington for the impasse. He said Europe had offered a lot but had received little in return. He added: \u201cThere cannot be an agreement without France and much less against France.\u201d All 28 EU member states and the European parliament will have to ratify TTIP before it comes into force. But that day seems further away than ever, with talks bogged down after 13 rounds of negotiations spread over nearly three years. The gulf between the two sides was highlighted by a massive leak of documents on Monday, first reported by the Guardian, which revealed \u201cirreconcilable\u201d differences on consumer protection and animal welfare standards. The publication of 248 pages of negotiating texts and internal positions, obtained by Greenpeace and seen by the Guardian, showed that the two sides remain far apart on how to align regulations on environment and consumer protection. Greenpeace said the leak demonstrated that the EU and the US were in a race to the bottom on health and environmental standards, but negotiators on both sides rejected these claims. The European commission, which leads negotiations on behalf of the EU, dismissed the \u201calarmist headlines\u201d as \u201ca storm in a teacup\u201d. But Tuesday\u2019s comments from the heart of the French government reveal how difficult TTIP negotiations have become. France has always had the biggest doubts about TTIP. In 2013 the French government secured an exemption for its film industry from TTIP talks to try to shelter French-language productions from Hollywood dominance. Hollande, who is beset by dire poll ratings, indicated on Tuesday that the government has other concerns about TTIP. Speaking at a conference on the history of the left, Hollande said he would never accept \u201cthe undermining of the essential principles of our agriculture, our culture, of mutual access to public markets\u201d. Fekl told French radio that the agreement on the table is \u201ca bad deal\u201d. \u201cEurope is offering a lot and we are getting very little in return. That is unacceptable,\u201d he said. The director of Greenpeace EU, Jorgo Riss, said the French president\u2019s concern was \u201cunsurprising given that the commission is clearly not following the mandate it was given by EU countries to protect European environmental and health standards\u201d. The question marks over TTIP are a setback for the British prime minister, David Cameron, who last year vowed to put \u201crocket boosters\u201d under the talks as he described TTIP as \u201ca deal we want\u201d. But Barack Obama has made it clear that the UK would not get any special treatment if it left the EU and tried to negotiate a separate trade deal. On a visit to London last month, the US president said the UK would be at \u201cthe back of the queue\u201d in any post-Brexit trade talks. The most recent round of TTIP negotiations took place last week, where EU and US officials reiterated that they hoped to reach a deal in the second half of 2016, before Barack Obama leaves the White House next January. Talks began in July 2013, but rapidly became bogged down amid widespread public concern on both sides of the Atlantic. Reducing tariffs is only a small element of the trade pact. The most contentious issues centre on aligning consumer and environmental standards and opening up markets to transatlantic rivals.",

      "bodyText": "Profits at HSBC fell in the first three months of 2016 as a result of volatility on the global markets in January and February, raising questions about the dividend policy at Britain\u2019s biggest bank. Statutory pre-tax profits in the three months to the end of March fell by 14% to $6.1bn (\u00a34.2bn), which the bank described as \u201ca resilient performance despite challenging market conditions\u201d. If currency movements and other one-off items were excluded, profits fell by 18% to $5.4bn. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cMarket uncertainty led to extreme levels of volatility in January and February, which affected our ability to generate revenue in our markets and wealth management businesses. However, our diversified, universal banking business model helped to cushion the impact through growth in other parts of the bank.\u201d The dividend was held at 10\u00a2 a share and the bank tried to quash concerns that management\u2019s plans to increase the payout each year would be difficult to achieve, by pointing out that earnings for the quarter easily covered the $2.1bn cost of the dividend for those three months. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cHSBC declared an unchanged dividend of 10\u00a2, which was twice covered by earnings over the quarter. Investors are clearly concerned on this front though, because a 7.5% yield on the stock suggests the market is sceptical the dividend can be maintained.\u201d Analysts at Bernstein said the plan to increase dividends was untenable. The bank is the second-largest dividend payer in the FTSE 100. Gulliver, who presented the results from Hong Kong, is in the process of cutting 25,000 jobs, a plan announced last June. The first quarter results show that the bank employed 254,212 staff, 991 fewer than at the end of 2015, even though it hired another 536 in compliance and 1,357 in other key roles. In the UK, another 53 branches are to shut this year, on top of the 78 already closed. HSBC has sold off more than 80 businesses and is close to completing the sale of its Brazilian bank, which should bolster the company\u2019s capital. In the small print attached to the accounts, the bank set out the risks it faces, including compliance with the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) agreed with US authorities at the time of HSBC\u2019s \u00a31.2bn fine for money laundering offences. In February, the bank admitted that the official monitor installed as part of that DPA, Michael Cherkasky, had raised \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about the slow pace of change to its procedures to combat crime. Gulliver said the management was sincere in its attempts to make the changes required by Cherkasky. Gulliver also pointed to the increased cost to the bank, which has been mired in controversy over the activities in its Swiss business and the Panama Papers, of regulatory and compliance programmes that reached $700m during the quarter, an increase of 19%. Bernstein analysts said that while the bank\u2019s profits were better than expected, its capital position was weaker. They also pointed to the continuing costs of meeting the requests of the monitor as a factor weighing on the bank\u2019s expenses. \u201cThere was nil customer redress taken this quarter (compared with $337m in the fourth quarter) and nil legal provision also,\u201d the analysts said. The bank, which is keeping its headquarters in London after a nine-month review, incurred costs of $31m in complying with rules to ringfence its high-street arm in the UK. HSBC set out information about its exposure to the oil and gas sector, which is currently a focus for investors due to the low oil price, and said 3% of its $30bn exposure was impaired. The bank is seeking a new chairman to replace Douglas Flint, who has said he will leave next year. Whoever is appointed will be expected to begin the process of finding a successor to Gulliver, who has been chief executive since 2011. The finance director, Iain Mackay, who is a possible contender to take the helm, set out two possible risks to the dividend: a spike in capital requirements and/or an economic recession. He said international regulators were still consulting on capital rules. \u201cUnfortunately this is a set of conditions we\u2019ve had [with regards to capital] for a number of years,\u201d Mackay said.",

      "bodyText": "An increase in fees charged to UK restaurants has delivered extra profit for Just Eat, the online takeaway food service. Just Eat, which lets diners order food from 27,000 UK restaurants, increased its commission rate by a percentage point to 13% for existing customers at the start of April. It said restaurants reacted positively to the changes, which also included paying them weekly instead of twice a month. The extra commission meant Just Eat expected annual revenue of \u00a3358m, up from an earlier prediction of \u00a3350m. After investing some of the extra money, annual earnings are forecast to be \u00a34m higher than expected at \u00a3102m to \u00a3104m. In the three months to the end of March, the first quarter of Just Eat\u2019s financial year, food orders rose 57% to 31.5m as diners increasingly opted to order takeaways on computers, tablets and phones. Underlying order growth was 41%. Just Eat shares rose 8.5% to 416p after the earnings upgrade and were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 350 index. The company is one of the big successes from the wave of flotations in 2014 when it listed its shares at 260p. The company is tapping into the trend for time-pressed households to order takeaways and increased use of smartphones and tablets. As a result, Britain is predicted to spend almost \u00a38bn a year on pizzas, curries and other takeaway meals by the end of this decade. Just Eat sends orders to restaurants using its service in return for a fee, claiming it is worth the expense for the extra orders generated. The company started life in Denmark in 2001 but moved five years later to the UK, its biggest market. It has operations across Europe as well as in Canada, Latin America and Australia, and has signed up a total of 64,000 restaurants. David Buttress, Just Eat\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe have had an excellent start to 2016 and I am delighted with the company\u2019s performance and the momentum in the business. Our focused strategy and improvements to both our consumer offering and restaurant support are working and we are well positioned to continue benefitting from channel shift in the category.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ahead of Sainsbury\u2019s results on Wednesday, analysts at HSBC have cautioned that the supermarket group\u2019s purchase of Argos could cause disruption at a key time for the business. HSBC analyst David Mccarthy said: Sainsbury lacks scale compared to Tesco in an industry that is scale driven, in our view. We also believe Sainsbury is vulnerable to a Tesco recovery that is gaining momentum. To combat this, Sainsbury is buying Argos with the expectation it will be a game changer. The deal is due to complete later this year when we expect price competition to intensify. We expect Tesco to turn the heat up again as part of its long-term plan, Asda to start trying to recover margin, and the industry generally to increase competition as Sainsbury faces the difficult task of converting and integrating the Argos business. There are positives around the Argos purchase, mainly concerning the loan book, for which consumers pay nearly 30% interest, but we do not see a retail solution to Sainsbury\u2019s structural disadvantages. Sainsbury has moved to a medium-low pricing strategy. We applaud this move, which sees overall core prices lower and less reliance on promotions. This brings more consistency in sales performance, which in turn makes forecasting and store operations simpler and more efficient. However, this does not address the disadvantages it faces through a lack of scale versus the market leader. These scale disadvantages include buying, cost sharing, and distribution. When Tesco was not using its advantages efficiently, Sainsbury did well, but now Tesco is becoming increasingly efficient in sharing these benefits with customers. 2015/16 results [are] due Wednesday 4 May. We expect EBIT to be down around 12% to \u00a3685m, and EBIT margin down 38 basis points to 2.92%. We forecast underlying pre-tax profit to have fallen to \u00a3575m from \u00a3681m last year. This near 16% decline follows on from a near 15% decline last year. As the dividend is linked to earnings, we expect a further decline in dividend per share to 11.6p versus 13.2p last year. Although some may suggest that Sainsbury has done well on a relative basis in recent years, on an absolute basis the company has seen its underlying profit performance deteriorate in a concerning manner. We remain cautious on Sainsbury, expecting further declines in profits and dividends over the next several years. Argos integration will confuse the numbers for a while, but the real issue is the potential disruption Argos could bring at a crucial time. HSBC has a reduce rating on the shares and a target price of 200p. Sainsbury is currently down 3.4p at 285.5p.",

Although some may suggest that Sainsbury has done well on a relative basis in recent years, on an absolute basis the company has seen its underlying profit performance deteriorate in a concerning manner. </p> <p>We remain cautious on Sainsbury, expecting further declines in profits and dividends over the next several years. Argos integration will confuse the numbers for a while, but the real issue is the potential disruption Argos could bring at a crucial time. </p> </blockquote> <p>HSBC has a reduce rating on the shares and a target price of 200p. Sainsbury is currently down 3.4p at 285.5p.</p>",

Joules announced its intention to sell shares on London\u2019s Aim by the end of next month in a transaction likely to value the company at about \u00a3140m. Tom Joule founded the company in 1989 selling branded clothing and accessories at outdoor events. After spotting the country set wanted more colourful clothes than dowdy tweeds he introduced his own line of pink wellington boots, which sold out immediately. In 2001, the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease wiped out the country events season, leaving the business with large amounts of stock. Joule sold it to independent shops, turning his business into a wholesaler and then a retailer though it still sells its goods at country fairs. The brand has become less rustic and now sells clothes for women, men and children as well as homewares aimed at middle-class families. The company, based in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, has 98 shops in the UK and sells to John Lewis and Next and online in the US and Germany. After tapping Lloyds Development Capital (LDC) for investment in 2013, Joule owns 80% of the company. LDC will sell most or all of its 20% stake and Joule, who will stay on as chief brand officer, will reduce his holding to less than 50%, making him about \u00a340m with his remaining stake valued at almost \u00a370m. Joules\u2019s revenue rose 50% to \u00a3116.4m in the two years to May 2015 as earnings before interest, tax and other items rose to \u00a310.7m from \u00a37.4m. International sales almost tripled to \u00a310.6m in that period. The company said it planned more stores in the UK and further growth in the US and Germany and was eyeing Japan, China and the Middle East. Colin Porter, Joules\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cJoules has enjoyed strong, consistent growth developing into the much-loved fun, family, \u2018time-off\u2019 lifestyle brand it is today.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s factories suffered their worst month in three years in April as falling export orders and a lack of domestic demand for consumer goods squeezed manufacturing output. Growth in factory output has been on the slide for a year, but last month the manufacturing sector contracted for the first time since March 2013. Economists believe the decline will drag on GDP growth this year. Financial data provider Markit, which carried out the survey, said manufacturers had blamed slower growth in the UK and a downturn in new export orders alongside \u201crising uncertainty about the global economy, the oil and gas industry, retail sector and the EU referendum\u201d. The slump in factory output provided a double blow for George Osborne after the European commission downgraded its forecast for UK growth this year to 1.8%, down from a previous forecast of 2.1%, before inching up to 1.9% in 2017. A fall in jobs was a knock-on effect of the factory activity downturn, said Markit. Its data shows almost 20,000 job losses over the past three months, mostly among large employers. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said the job cuts were \u201cthe clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy\u201d. She added: \u201cHowever, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\u201d Commenting on its growth downgrades, the European commission said: \u201cRisks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, reflecting less favourable external demand and uncertainty in the lead-up to the June referendum. Net exports are forecast to continue to detract from growth although less markedly in 2017.\u201d More widely, the JP Morgan global manufacturing index was stuck at 50.1 in April, reflecting a near standstill in production across the world stretching back over the last two of years. Much of the blame was heaped on a deterioration in international trade flows through 2015 and into this year. The level of new export business fell for the third straight month and to the greatest extent since September of last year. Pro-EU ministers have blamed the uncertainty surrounding next month\u2019s referendum for undermining confidence among consumers and producers and restricting new orders and investment. However, the decline in factory output is a broad trend, indicated by a steep fall in the US manufacturing PMI on Sunday to its lowest level since 2009 and stagnation in China and much of Europe. Economists have also blamed the government\u2019s austerity measures for reducing government spending and hitting household incomes. The Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) fell in April to 49.2, below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, for the first time since March 2013. The sector was still growing in March when the index registered a revised 50.7. Markit said the headline index was dragged lower by \u201clacklustre trends in production and new orders and declines in both employment and stocks of purchases\u201d. In the UK, new export orders fell for the fourth straight month as global economic growth continued to slow. To emphasise the point, firms producing equipment for international mining and infrastructure projects reported a sharp drop in new export business. Rob Dobson, Markit\u2019s senior economist, said: \u201cThe UK manufacturing PMI fell below its critical 50 mark for the first time in over three years in April, highlighting a further deepening of the sector\u2019s downturn at the start of the second quarter. \u201cOn this evidence, manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have started the shortened trading week in a downbeat mood after weak Chinese manufacturing data raised new concerns about the world\u2019s second largest economy. But insurers are bucking the trend. A new survey from the AA showed a small fall in car insurance rates after recent sharp rises, but the organisation believes the upward trend will soon resume. So Admiral has accelerated 68p to \u00a319.25 while Direct Line is up 6.7p at 368.6p. Analyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said: According to the AA Insurance, the so-called Shop around rate for comprehensive motor cover reduced by 0.4% and by around 1% for non-comp cover, leaving rates up around 21% and around 15% over the year respectively (with the latter impacted by the increase in the insurance premium tax in the fourth quarter of 2015...for example comprehensive rates were up around 10% in the fourth quarter. Although the first quarter of each year is often viewed as the most competitive, as companies attempt to build market share (to coincide with new car registrations), our analysis of the indices implies a fairly even spread of rate increases and reductions in the quarter. The key issue for the industry remains elevated levels of claims frequency and severity, which the rating environment is struggling to keep pace with. Sadly, whiplash claims remain a real problem for the industry despite repeated attempts by the government to address the issue. A survey from Willis Towers Watson/confused.com painted a similar picture, and analysts at Peel Hunt said: Quarterly rate trends were relatively flat during the first quarter 2016, as the Motor sector took a pause after strong rate increases in the second half of 2015. Year on year, underlying rates (excluding insurance premium tax) were up an estimated 9.6%, in line with the annual trend in the fourth quarter of 2015. With signs that claims inflation is stabilising and having built up margin in the fourth quarter, it seems the industry has had its usual competitive start to the year. Willis Towers Watson indicates that underlying trends continue to point to further rate increases in 2016. RSA Insurance is 15.3p better at 474.4p as Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight and raised its target price by 19% to 545p. It said: RSA has set out its ambition to close the gap to the best in class players in each of its core markets, UK, Scandinavia and Canada by 2018. While we acknowledge that it is rare for a mid of the pack insurer to become a \u201cbest in class\u201d insurer, we do believe RSA has set out a realistic plan to get there. RSA\u2019s ambition is to have a combined ratio of 94% or lower in the UK and Canada, and 85% or below in Scandinavia. We believe there is significant upside even if the company is only partially successful, and we revise our price target of 545p is based on the company on getting half way to its targets. With 19% upside to our revised price target of 545p, coupled with a 3% 2016 yield, we upgrade our rating to overweight. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 44.12 points to 6197.77, although off its worst levels after a weaker than expected UK manufacturing survey for April, making it even less likely that the Bank of England will make any imminent move to raise interest rates. Among the fallers, mining shares have been hit once more by the worries about China, with Anglo American down 57.3p at 706.1p and Rio Tinto 94p lower at 2206.5p. Banks are also heading lower after poor results from Germany\u2019s Commerzbank. So despite reasonable results from HSBC, its shares have dropped 2.4p to 450.1p. But BT is 3.8p better at 447p as UBS moved its recommendation from sell to neutral. Among the mid-caps Just Eat has jumped 37p to 420.5p after reporting a 57% rise in first quarter orders and raising its guidance for full year profits from \u00a398m-\u00a3100m to \u00a3102m-\u00a3104m. But Aberdeen Asset Management has dropped 23.3p to 275.4p as its half year profits fell by 40% on weakness in emerging markets. Numis moved from add to hold, calling the figures \u201can all round bad set of results.\u201d It said: In the short term, the group remains very much exposed to the fortunes of emerging markets, where we for choice would now prefer to wait for a more attractive entry point. Long term, you need to believe the group can achieve growth in other areas and/or make further cost cutting motivated acquisitions and/or will be sold to justify purchasing here.",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares have started the shortened trading week in a downbeat mood after weak Chinese manufacturing data raised new concerns about the world\u2019s second largest economy.</p> <p>But insurers are bucking the trend. A new survey from the AA showed a small fall in car insurance rates after recent sharp rises, but the organisation believes the upward trend will soon resume.</p> <p>So <strong>Admiral </strong>has accelerated 68p to \u00a319.25 while <strong>Direct Line</strong> is up 6.7p at 368.6p. Analyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the AA Insurance, the so-called Shop around rate for comprehensive motor cover reduced by 0.4% and by around 1% for non-comp cover, leaving rates up around 21% and around 15% over the year respectively (with the latter impacted by the increase in the insurance premium tax in the fourth quarter of 2015...for example comprehensive rates were up around 10% in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>Although the first quarter of each year is often viewed as the most competitive, as companies attempt to build market share (to coincide with new car registrations), our analysis of the indices implies a fairly even spread of rate increases and reductions in the quarter. The key issue for the industry remains elevated levels of claims frequency and severity, which the rating environment is struggling to keep pace with. Sadly, whiplash claims remain a real problem for the industry despite repeated attempts by the government to address the issue.</p> </blockquote> <p>A survey from Willis Towers Watson/confused.com painted a similar picture, and analysts at Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Quarterly rate trends were relatively flat during the first quarter 2016, as the Motor sector took a pause after strong rate increases in the second half of 2015. Year on year, underlying rates (excluding insurance premium tax) were up an estimated 9.6%, in line with the annual trend in the fourth quarter of 2015. With signs that claims inflation is stabilising and having built up margin in the fourth quarter, it seems the industry has had its usual competitive start to the year. Willis Towers Watson indicates that underlying trends continue to point to further rate increases in 2016. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>RSA Insurance</strong> is 15.3p better at 474.4p as Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight and raised its target price by 19% to 545p. It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>RSA has set out its ambition to close the gap to the best in class players in each of its core markets, UK, Scandinavia and Canada by 2018. While we acknowledge that it is rare for a mid of the pack insurer to become a \u201cbest in class\u201d insurer, we do believe RSA has set out a realistic plan to get there. RSA\u2019s ambition is to have a combined ratio of 94% or lower in the UK and Canada, and 85% or below in Scandinavia. We believe there is significant upside even if the company is only partially successful, and we revise our price target of 545p is based on the company on getting half way to its targets. With 19% upside to our revised price target of 545p, coupled with a 3% 2016 yield, we upgrade our rating to overweight.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has fallen 44.12 points to 6197.77, although off its worst levels after a weaker than expected UK manufacturing survey for April, making it even less likely that the Bank of England will make any imminent move to raise interest rates.</p> <p>Among the fallers, mining shares have been hit once more by the worries about China, with <strong>Anglo American</strong> down 57.3p at 706.1p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> 94p lower at 2206.5p.</p> <p>Banks are also heading lower after poor results from Germany\u2019s Commerzbank. So despite <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/03/hsbc-profits-fall-14-as-global-volatility-hits-bottom-line\">reasonable results</a></strong> from <strong>HSBC</strong>, its shares have dropped 2.4p to 450.1p.</p> <p>But <strong>BT </strong>is 3.8p better at 447p as UBS moved its recommendation from sell to neutral.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Just Eat</strong> has jumped 37p to 420.5p after reporting a 57% rise in first quarter orders and raising its guidance for full year profits from \u00a398m-\u00a3100m to \u00a3102m-\u00a3104m.</p> <p>But <strong>Aberdeen Asset Management </strong>has dropped 23.3p to 275.4p as its half year profits fell by 40% on weakness in emerging markets. Numis moved from add to hold, calling the figures \u201can all round bad set of results.\u201d It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the short term, the group remains very much exposed to the fortunes of emerging markets, where we for choice would now prefer to wait for a more attractive entry point. Long term, you need to believe the group can achieve growth in other areas and/or make further cost cutting motivated acquisitions and/or will be sold to justify purchasing here. </p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "It is predicted that driverless cars will prevent the vast majority of crashes and dramatically reduce the cost of insuring a car, according to industry experts. Volvo\u2019s chief executive will tell a seminar on driverless cars on Tuesday that autonomous vehicles are the \u201csingle most important advance in automotive safety\u201d in years. The Swedish carmaker\u2019s boss, H\u00e5kan Samuelsson, will cite US government research predicting that driverless cars will lead to an 80% fall in the number of car crashes by 2035. Even when an accident cannot be avoided, the impact speed will also drop due to automatic crash avoidance systems, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The result will be a huge decrease in the cost of car insurance premiums, according to separate research by insurer Swiss Re and the technology group Here. Premiums in the 14 largest car markets in the world are set to drop by $20bn (\u00a313.5bn) by 2020 alone, according to their projections. \u201cCar connectivity and the introduction of increasingly sophisticated driver-assist technologies and autonomous driving will lead to significantly improved road safety,\u201d they said. The report predicts that by 2020, more than two-thirds of cars sold worldwide will have some form of connectivity to the internet and other cars. Vehicle safety firm Thatcham Research said existing technology such as Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) had already reduced the frequency of road accidents. Its chief executive, Peter Shaw, said technology that allows drivers to \u201cdrop out of the loop\u201d for parts of the journey would be available as soon as 2021. \u201cWithout doubt, crash frequency will also dramatically reduce,\u201d he said. While drivers will welcome tumbling premiums, motor insurance experts warned that the industry will need to be overhauled or face extinction. \u201cVolvo believes the insurance industry will have no choice but to react to these seismic challenges to its existing business model by fundamentally restructuring \u2013 or face competition from new entrants into its market from technology-savvy disrupting companies,\u201d said Samuelsson. Insurance analyst Barrie Cornes, of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, warned that firms with a strong presence in motor insurance, such as Admiral or RAC, were under threat. He said specialist motor insurers would have to diversify into other areas. \u201cBusinesses will have to transform or motor insurers are going to die,\u201d Cornes said. \u201cIt\u2019s a number of years before we get there and there will be a transition period during which premiums are still going to be high. But it could well be that [motor insurers] move into home insurance, pet insurance and other areas.\u201d Volvo will begin the largest driverless car trial yet seen in the UK next year, with around 100 autonomous vehicles set to hit the streets. Britain is hoping to be at the forefront of autonomous driving, partly due to a legal loophole. The UK is one of the European countries not to have ratified the 1968 Vienna convention on road traffic that stipulates a driver must be in the front seat of a car. However, the government is still working on its own regulations to keep pace with changing technology. Samuelsson called on the government to help carmakers get driverless cars on the road as soon as possible. \u201cThe automotive industry cannot do this on its own,\u201d he said. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, said he was determined that the UK should lead the way in making the technology a reality. \u201cSuch advances in technology prove the fourth industrial revolution is just around the corner and our determination to be at the forefront is why we are attracting top names from across the globe for real-world testing,\u201d he said. However, the Association of British Insurers warned drivers not to get complacent about driving safely before the technology was fully developed. \u201cAutomation could be the biggest breakthrough in road safety since the invention of the seatbelt and insurers fully support its development,\u201d said James Dalton, the ABI\u2019s director of general insurance policy. \u201cHowever we need to get there safely. The growth in features like automatic braking and lane assistance systems may give drivers a false sense of security that they can relax while their car looks after them. But unless a vehicle is fully automated and able to respond appropriately in an emergency, drivers still have to be ready to take back control at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d",
