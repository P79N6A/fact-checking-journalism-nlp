      "bodyText": "Wonga, the payday lender that became notorious for its extortionate interest rates and was a toxic symbol of Britain\u2019s household debt crisis, has collapsed into administration after it was brought down by a welter of compensation claims. Its collapse on Thursday leaves an estimated 200,000 customers still owing more than \u00a3400m in short-term loans. But borrowers were told to continue making payments and administrators are expected to sell Wonga\u2019s loan book to another lending firm. After emergency talks the finance industry watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, said it would continue to supervise Wonga and seek fair treatment for customers. But it added: \u201cCustomers should continue to make any outstanding payments in the normal way. All existing agreements remain in place and will not be affected by the proposed administration.\u201d Wonga, known for controversial adverts featuring puppet grandparents, has been condemned over the years by campaigners for \u201clegal loan sharking\u201d and targeting vulnerable borrowers with small loans which quickly spiralled out of control. At one point customers faced interest rates as high as 5,853%, before they were capped by ministers in 2015 and now stand at about 1,500%. Britain\u2019s consumer debt mountain of more than \u00a3200bn \u2013 for car loans, credit cards and personal loans \u2013 has been labelled unsustainable by a leading credit agency, while the Bank of England has warned lenders about a \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d over consumers being able to service their debts. As Wonga fell into administration, the Labour MP Stella Creasy, a prominent payday loan campaigner, tweeted Wonga\u2019s customers need to be protected, but warned that the vulnerable were still being targeted. \u201cThe list of legal loan sharks goes on \u2026 Want to cap the lot of them,\u201d she said. During Wonga\u2019s heyday, the Church of England called the company \u201cmorally wrong\u201d and Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, pledged to compete it and other payday lenders out of existence. The Just Finance Foundation, Welby\u2019s charity, welcomed news of Wonga\u2019s demise. Canon Paul Hackwood, a trustee of the foundation, said: \u201cToday we are seeing the result of the much-needed tougher financial regulations starting to bite.\u201d Once lined up for a stock market flotation with a price tag approaching \u00a31bn, Wonga was laid low by a cap on interest rates that ruined its business model \u2013 but was tipped into collapse by a more recent flood of compensation claims. In 2014 it was censured for issuing fake legal letters to customers in arrears and was ordered to pay compensation of \u00a32.6m. In recent years, claims management firms have targeted the company over a number of issues and complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service, an official body that deals with unhappy borrowers, have surged. In 2015 Wonga and other payday lenders were hit with a price cap on their loans which slashed interest rates to a maximum of 0.8% a day and dealt a further blow to the high-cost credit industry In its last accounts, published in September 2017, the company reported a loss of \u00a366.5m, but said costs and impairments were falling and that it remained a going concern. It said it had 220,000 customers and \u00a3430m in loans outstanding, figures which are likely to have decreased since then. But in recent months Wonga has been hit by a wave of compensation claims, which cost the company \u00a3550 per claim to process, whether the borrower\u2019s claim is upheld or not. Many have come from claims management companies, such as PaydayRefunds, which said it had entered about 8,000 claims against the lender in the last six months alone. Wonga raised an emergency \u00a310m from shareholders as recently as early August, but the extra cash appears to have accelerated the flow of compensation claims. Anyone who made a claim but has not received compensation is now unlikely to receive a payout. A spokesman for the Financial Ombudsman Service said: \u201cWe are aware of the recently announced news about Wonga\u2019s administration. Due to the nature of the business, there is no protection offered to consumers under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) in this instance. \u201cOnce the administrators have been appointed, we\u2019ll speak to them urgently to clarify the impact on the cases we have with us and whether we\u2019ll be able to work any new cases brought to us after today. We do not yet know what, if any, funds will be available to settle complaints.\u201d In a statement, Wonga said its board had assessed \u201call options\u201d and concluded that administration was the only option, with accountancy group Grant Thornton called in to run the failed business as administrators. The Wonga board said: \u201cWonga customers can continue to use Wonga services to manage their existing loans but the UK business will not be accepting any new loan applications.\u201d The collapse of Wonga puts more than 500 jobs at risk, mostly in the London area where the company has its head office. The shadow economic secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said he would not mourn its demise. \u201cIts business model was exploitative and immoral. Wonga had become a testament to so much that is wrong with our economy \u2013 too many people stuck in insecure employment reliant on short-term debt just to keep their heads above water. \u201cWe need urgent action from the government to change this broken model and review the way lending is regulated.\u201d Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said the firm\u2019s collapse was a cause for celebration. \u201cNormally when firms go bust, the fear is diminished competition. Not here. Wonga\u2019s payday loans were the crack cocaine of debt \u2013 unneeded, unwanted, unhelpful, destructive and addictive. Its behaviour was immoral, from using pretend lawyers to threaten the vulnerable, to pumping its ads out on children\u2019s TV.\u201d The Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, who has become a campaigner against high-cost lenders, said the collapse was a \u201cpivotal moment\u201d the government should use to support the growth of ethical lenders. \u201c[Wonga] thrived when they thrived because of demand. That demand is not going to go away. The real danger is that those customers are going to go to possibly even worse places. The opportunity is there, there are alternatives \u2013 there are fair and responsible credit providers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Argentina has hiked interest rates to 60% as it takes dramatic steps to restore confidence in its plunging currency,in the latest sign of turmoil among emerging market economies this year. The Argentine central bank raised the cost of borrowing by 15 percentage points on Thursday in an attempt to shore up the peso, which has plummeted in value. The central bank said it would keep rates unchanged at 60% until at least December. The peso dropped amid intense trading on foreign exchanges, falling by more than 10%, despite the bank\u2019s rate move, in the most severe drop for the currency since it was floated in 2015. $1 (77p) is now worth about more than 39 pesos, having been worth about 18 pesos at the start of the year. Paul Greer of the City fund manager Fidelity said countries across emerging markets were being targeted by investors due to their economic problems, including high levels of debt and imports. \u201cThere are no easy answers for Argentina to its current woes,\u201d he said. Elsewhere on Thursday, the Turkish lira fell by more than 4% against the dollar amid increasing concerns over economic crises in developing nations. So far this year the Indian rupee and the South African rand have also come under pressure as concerns grow that the countries will struggle to pay their dollar-denominated debts following a rise in US interest rates. The rand fell a further 3% against the dollar on Thursday. With Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish president, under pressure from US sanctions imposed by Donald Trump in a dispute over an imprisoned American pastor, the lira has already seen a depreciation of about 40% against the dollar this year. Financial markets around the world sold off on Thursday as fears over the fallout from the crises unfolded, while there are also concerns over the impact of the White House\u2019s various trade disputes around the world. The FTSE 100 closed down 0.7% while on Wall Street the Dow closed down 0.5%. The latest developments come as the US dollar gathers strength this year with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, reminiscent of the early 1990s when tighter monetary policy under the former Fed chair Alan Greenspan triggered a series of crises across the developing world. Although the problems stem from Washington, there have been concerns the fallout could infect markets around the world, with Argentina and Turkey in the eye of the storm. Having approached the International Monetary Fund for emergency support amid an unfolding economic crisis, Argentina asked the Washington-based lender of last resort earlier this week to accelerate the release of the money to bolster its finances. Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, has said a lack of trust from the markets had forced him to ask for help as the peso weakens and inflation runs at 30%. The country has asked to borrow $50bn from the IMF to restore confidence in its finances amid high levels of government debt in dollars, which have become more expensive to pay off as the dollar strengthens. While the move was designed to soothe investor concerns, the effect has been the opposite in the financial markets, triggering concerns about the country\u2019s ability to pay its debts. Despite the massive increase for interest rates to 60% \u2013 by comparison the cost of borrowing is as low as 0.75% in the UK \u2013 economists said Argentina may still require further government action to bring the crisis under control. Edward Glossop of the research consultancy Capital Economics said Buenos Aires would need to give more details about how it planned to meet the targets for tax and spending set by the IMF. Latin America\u2019s third biggest economy is forecast to shrink this year, while borrowing has become harder for firms in the country amid higher interest rates. \u201cMaintaining investor confidence from here will require help from the government, which has been largely unconvincing over the past few weeks,\u201d Glossop said.",

      "bodyText": "Timing is everything in financial markets. And Argentina\u2019s embattled president, Mauricio Macri, just got it spectacularly wrong. Late on Wednesday, it emerged that Macri had asked the International Monetary Fund to speed up the disbursement of its $50bn (\u00a338bn) rescue package for South America\u2019s second biggest economy. Coming at the end of a day that had seen the peso fall heavily against the US dollar, the announcement was intended to shore up confidence. Currency dealers didn\u2019t see it that way. Working on the assumption that Argentina\u2019s problems must be even worse than they thought, they dumped the peso in even bigger quantities when the market in Buenos Aires opened for business. That triggered the next line of defence from the central bank: an increase in interest rates from 45% to 60% coupled with a commitment to hold borrowing costs at that punitive level until December. This didn\u2019t really work either. That there would only be a modest rally in the peso was only to be expected: Argentina is on course for an almighty recession and that could spell curtains for Macri in next year\u2019s presidential election. The country faces a toxic mix of financial, economic and political uncertainty. As if to prove the truth of Tolstoy\u2019s dictum that all unhappy families are unhappy in their own way, the other emerging market in the firing line this week has been Turkey. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the president, does not like high interest rates and will not let the central bank use them to combat high inflation or to defend the currency. Nor does he want to enlist the support of the IMF. In the light of what happened to Macri when he tried to do things by the book, Erdo\u011fan probably now feels his unorthodox approach has been vindicated. But so far his strategy has amounted to getting a $15bn loan from Qatar and that will not be nearly enough. The next update on inflation due next Monday looks like being a pivotal event. For years, there have been worries about what would happen to the emerging markets once global financial market conditions started to tighten. Countries that had borrowed heavily in US dollars \u2013 as many have \u2013 were inevitably going to find life a lot tougher when US interest rates started to rise. Those risks have now started to crystalise. Argentina and Turkey are particularly vulnerable, which is why they have been picked off first. But they are not alone. Other countries to keep an eye on over the coming weeks include South Africa, Ukraine, India and Indonesia. The IMF has already warned that debt in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries has risen to risky levels. For those with long enough memories, August has seen a worrying pattern emerge. Investors take fright at the deterioration in key economic indicators in countries that have seen hefty capital inflows in the past, and decide to shift their money somewhere safer. The resulting fall in the currency makes imports dearer and adds to inflationary pressure. Companies that have borrowed in foreign currency see their debt burdens increase. Recession bites and the contagion spreads to other countries deemed to be vulnerable. This is not yet a full-blown crisis to match that of the late 1990s but there are enough warning signs \u2013 trade tensions, high debt levels and a global economy losing momentum \u2013 to suggest that is the way things are heading.",

      "bodyText": "Larry Elliott is right to say that \u201cthe left had its chance and blew it\u201d after the economic crash, and right to identify the left\u2019s lack of a clear and united narrative as one of the main reasons for this (Opinion, 30 August). Instead, the different strands of the left \u201call headed off in their own directions\u201d, as Elliott says. It is worth exploring this in a little more detail and picking out two key problems. One of the biggest obstacles to developing a common left framework was the fact that during the crisis, social democratic parties throughout Europe kept on going into right-led coalitions which were implementing cuts and austerity programmes. The subsequent collapses of the social democratic parties in Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Germany and other countries all bear witness to this. The second big obstacle to forging a common left framework is the EU. This has become a major line of division on the left. The pro-integration left has yet to find a way of explaining how more progressive policies can be implemented in an EU whose economic policies have entrenched some of the neoliberal approaches that precipitated the crisis in the first place. However, the more Eurosceptic left equally has not found a way of explaining how a weakened EU can lead to progressive policies across Europe. Until an effective way of advancing progressive reforms through the EU can be found, this will remain a significant hurdle for the European left. Dr Michael Holmes European Institute, Liverpool Hope University \u2022 Larry Elliott, in lamenting the lack of radical change in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, once again raises the question of how economics is taught. I would go further and question how it is measured. The fundamental flaw with economics is that it doesn\u2019t assess the real value to society of a particular economic activity, just its financialisation. Value is determined by the market. In other words, it is subordinated to consumers who are easily manipulated, and sometimes addicted, by vested interests. There is a widely held, old-fashioned view that work should be, predominantly, in the common interest. Governments should have a duty to consider action on all contested issues of social value by taking recommendations from a cross-party parliamentary committee, duly informed by expert opinion from across the spectrum of society \u2013 as is currently the case with energy drinks (Ministers to ban energy drink sales to children, 30 August). If the government found a recommendation politically unsavoury, eg phasing out the sale of tobacco, the economics discipline should, nonetheless, adjust its macroeconomic metrics to reflect the true value to the country as assessed \u2013 or would this be too much of a progressive idea?

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest payday lender, Wonga, has collapsed into administration following a wave of customer compensation claims, leaving more than 200,000 customers wondering what it means for their loans. The short-term loan provider has hired the accountancy firm Grant Thornton to handle the administration. It will now seek to find a buyer for the company\u2019s loan book. Customers have in recent days deluged the company\u2019s helpline, where an automated message says there are delays in answering \u201cbecause of a high volume of calls\u201d. I have a Wonga loan. Should I keep making repayments? There are believed to be about 220,000 existing Wonga customers. It is not a stock market quoted company, so few figures are available, but its last set of figures \u2013 now nearly two years old \u2013 showed it had \u00a3430m lent out, with an average loan size of \u00a3237. Even though Wonga has collapsed into administration, the legal obligation for customers to repay their debts remains unchanged. Those who do get through to the helpline are being told that if they fail to make a payment, their account will be passed to a debt recovery agency, with extra fees to pay. Wonga\u2019s website points out: \u201cThe first time you miss a payment, you\u2019ll have three days to repay before we charge you a missed payment fee of \u00a315.\u201d Wonga\u2019s main assets are the loans it provides and Grant Thornton will look to sell these to another company. That company will then have the legal right to chase Wonga\u2019s borrowers for the outstanding balance. However, they do not have the right to change the terms and conditions of a loan \u2013 they cannot increase the interest or demand early repayment. But a buyer of Wonga\u2019s existing loan book may take a more \u2013 or less \u2013 aggressive approach to debt recovery than Wonga. I have made a compensation claim against Wonga. What will happen now? Until today, claims for compensation were either being settled by the company or passed on to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). But now that Wonga is formally entering administration, compensation claimants will join the list of creditors. The claims management companies that have been pursuing Wonga reckon that means the chance of obtaining compensation will be next to zero. The FOS had warned that if Wonga went into administration it would not make any further assessments for compensation, and customers are not entitled to claim against the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Are the regulators doing anything to organise an orderly exit for the business? The Financial Conduct Authority has had urgent discussions with Wonga to ensure that customer rights are being taken into consideration. Why didn\u2019t Wonga take out a 4,000% short-term loan to get it through its financial problems? Twitter is alive with people making jokes at the company\u2019s expense. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with Wonga? Did they lend themselves a fiver?\u201d is typical.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound has managed to stay above the $1.30 mark, after comments from Michel Barnier boosted hopes that a Brexit deal will be struck. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator said \u201cwe are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country\u201d. Meanwhile a report that France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron will push for a deal with Britain also raised the possibility of a softer approach from the EU. The pound is at $1.3017 and is up 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1146. Pressure is mounting on Canada and the US as a Friday deadline looms for a new NAFTA agreement. Negotiators struck an upbeat tone but remain locked in talks. In the UK, payday lender Wonga stopped taking new loan applications as its troubles deepen, and the competition watchdog gave the provisional go-ahead to a merger between energy firms SSE and Npower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims rose last week, to 213,000 from 210,000 the week before. It was slightly below the 214,000 claims predicted by economists, but ended a three-week run of falls. However the broader picture was more positive, with the four-week moving average of initial claims falling 1,500 last week to 212,250 - the lowest level since December 1969. US consumer spending rose 0.4% in July, the same rate as June and in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. The figures from the Commerce Department showed that American households spent more at restaurants and on hotels and other accommodation last month. Consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of the US economy, and helped to boost growth in the second quarter, when GDP rose at an annualised rate of 4.2%, nearly double the 2.2% rate in the previous quarter. Not everyone with an eye on markets is in a gloomy mood today: Daniel Boffey, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, gives his take on Michel\u2019s Barnier\u2019s latest Brexit comments: Greece has suffered the deepest depression in the modern era, according to an analysis by economists at Llewellyn Consulting. Greece might have emerged from its final bail-out with official creditors, they say, but 10 years on from the global financial crisis, the country has yet to enjoy a meaningful recovery. They point out that among other things, GDP is still about 25% below its pre-crisis peak; nearly a fifth of the workforce are unemployed, and the proportion of people in poverty has doubled. All this represents the deepest contraction in a major economy in the modern era. The only comparable downturn is the 1930s Great Depression in the US. However, then US real GDP was back to its pre-crisis peak after seven years. Here is a Q&amp;A on what Wonga\u2019s collapse would mean for its customers: Jonathan Reynolds, Labour MP and shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, has responded to the news that payday lender Wonga has stopped taking new loan applications: We need urgent action from the government to change this broken model and review the way lending is regulated. I cannot mourn the demise of Wonga. Its business model was exploitative and immoral. Wonga had become a testament to so much that is wrong with our economy - too many people stuck in insecure employment reliant on short term debt just to keep their heads above water. That is why the next Labour government will lift living standards and tackle the persistent debt spiral that many working families have become trapped in by capping exploitative lending, increasing real wages, and ending austerity. With equity markets across Europe still falling and US futures down, Connor Campbell at Spread Ex considers why investors are in a glum mood: The sentiment in Europe remained sour, with all the major indices catching a serious case of the blues. It is hard to pinpoint the exact reason for the downturn. A lack of distraction arguably puts Brexit and the US-China trade war at the forefront of investors\u2019 minds, though on both fronts there has been slight progress, with Barnier\u2019s bullish comments in relation to the former, and the US-Mexico trade deal (admittedly a tenuous positive) in regards to the latter. Regardless of the reason, the Dow Jones is set to join the end of August malaise after the bell rings on Wall Street, with the futures pointing to a 90 points drop when the US session gets underway. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda, says the more positive tone on Brexit struck by the EU could be the first step towards taking a no deal scenario off the table, which would be supportive of the pound. He explains: The pound is paring gains but continues to trade around four week highs against the dollar, with the currency having been buoyed on Wednesday by comments from Michel Barnier who claimed to be open to the idea of a bespoke Brexit deal for the UK, something the EU had appeared averse to previously. The apparent softening in the language, combined with French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s desire to maintain close ties, come at a time when a no deal Brexit was looking increasingly likely. The latest comments suggest there is a strong desire within the EU to find a solution and avoid a no deal Brexit which is understandably good for the UK and the pound. Sterling had come under pressure in recent months as the prospect of no deal became more of a possibility but this is hopefully the first step towards it not becoming a reality. We\u2019ve seen a small relief rally but we\u2019ll need to see many more positive steps before traders get carried away. Economic sentiment in the eurozone fell for an eighth consecutive month in August, as industrial and services firms were less optimistic. The monthly survey by the European Commission showed the economic sentiment indicator for the 19 euro countries dipped to 11.6 points in August from 112.1 in July, extending the run of falls. Jessica Hinds, European economist at Capital Economics, says that despite another fall, the indicator points to fairly strong growth. Although the EC\u2019s measure of eurozone economic sentiment fell again in August, it remains at a high level and consistent with growth slowing only slightly from a very strong pace. On the face of it, it still points to a pick-up in annual GDP from 2.2% in the second quarter to around 3%. Note, though, that it has overstated growth since last summer and other surveys have been slightly less positive. So, overall, the surveys are consistent with only a modest slowdown. Economists at RBC have played down the importance of a more optimistic approach to Brexit from Michel Barnier and Emmanuel Macron, stressing that major hurdles remain: On Brexit, after yesterday\u2019s comments from Barnier (relationship such as there has never been with any other third country) the market appears more hopeful. French president Macron has apparently suggested a \u2018new architecture\u2019 of \u2018concentric circles\u2019 with the UK in the first ring around the euro area. We, however, stress that even if there is a deal struck between the EU and the UK, an even tougher hurdle will be to get any deal through the UK House of Commons - which at present seems to have moved down the ladder of concerns. \u200e This is particularly true as any deal is unlikely to see the EU make any material concessions, as Barnier also highlighted yesterday when he stressed the importance of the integrity of the single market. The German foreign minister also said in a tweet that there will be \u2018no special rules for post-Brexit UK\u2019. British consumers borrowed at the weakest rate in more than two-and-a-half years in July, according to figures from the Bank of England. Consumer credit growth slowed to an annual rate of 8.5% in July from 8.8% in June. It was the slowest since November 2015. Meanwhile mortgage approvals dipped to 64,768 from 65,374, slightly below economists\u2019 forecasts of 65,000. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says the mortgage figures are surprisingly weak: These figures are a little disappointing in that they reflect a period when we would have expected a pick-up in the market over the spring buying season. Buyers and sellers are still engaged in a stand-off, whereas lack of energised demand has meant there is often very little urgency to complete deals, even when terms have been agreed. There are regional variations, however. In London, owners who have accumulated property wealth from previous booms seem more reluctant to recognise softening prices whereas outside the capital, where loans to value are generally higher, we have noticed more enthusiasm to move. Overall, viewings are starting to rise as buyers return from holiday so we do expect to see some increase in activity over the next few months. The competition watchdog has given the provisional go-ahead to the merger of Npower and the retail arm of SSE. The Competition and Markets Authority found that the two firms did not compete closely for customers on the default standard variable tariffs that most people are on. Few people switched between the pair, it added. A merger between the two would reduce Britain\u2019s \u201cbig six\u201d energy providers to five. The newly combined company would have 11 million customers, making it the second biggest UK energy provider after British Gas, which has 12.6 million customers. The merger is expected to complete in late 2018 or early 2019. European investors are in a subdued mood, with all major indices in the red this morning after falls in Asian markets. FTSE 100: -0.7% at 7,508 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.4% at 12,513 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 5,493 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 20,690 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.03% at 9,567 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 385 Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets: Markets in Asia have continued to be dominated by concerns over simmering China trade tensions, and the prospect of further tariffs next month, while markets in Europe have also slipped back. The unresolved nature of the EU US trade talks is clearly acting as a drag on European markets in the same way that markets in Asia have continued to lag behind. Wonga has stopped taking new loan applications in a sign of deepening trouble at the payday lender on the brink of collapse. A statement on Wonga\u2019s website reads: While it continues to assess its options Wonga has decided to stop taking loan applications. If you are an existing customer you can continue to use our services to manage your loan. It follows reports over the weekend that Wonga has lined up accountancy firm Grant Thornton to handle a potential administration of the company. On Wednesday, the pay day lender held emergency talks with the Financial Conduct Authority over the impact of its collapse on existing customers. Negotiators for Canada and the US are locked in \u201cintense\u201d talks as they try to strike a new trade deal by the Friday deadline set by President Trump. Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said on Wednesday evening that talks were at \u201ca very intense moment\u201d but added there was \u201ca lot of good will\u201d between negotiators on both sides of the table. The pressure is on to modernise the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement after the US and Mexico reached a bilateral deal on Monday. Trump set a Friday deadline for all three countries to reach a deal, but Canada said late on Wednesday that a number of tricky issues were yet to be resolved. Trump has warned he could try to go ahead with a deal with Mexico alone and impose tariffs on Canadian-made cars if Ottawa does not agree a deal, although US lawmakers have said that ratifying a bilateral deal would not be easy. The US President told reporters at the White House: They (Canada) want to be part of the deal, and we gave until Friday and I think we\u2019re probably on track. We\u2019ll see what happens, but in any event, things are working out very well. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was giving nothing away: We recognise that there is a possibility of getting there by Friday, but it is only a possibility, because it will hinge on whether or not there is ultimately a good deal for Canada. No NAFTA deal is better than a bad NAFTA deal.\u201d France\u2019s President, Emmanuel Macron, is preparing to push other EU leaders to agree a Brexit deal with Britain, according to a report in the Times. Macron is hoping to persuade fellow leaders that a close relationship with Britain after Brexit will promote a united Europe. He will use a summit in Austria next month to outline a new structure for European alliances, the Time said, quoting unnamed diplomatic sources. The idea is based on \u201cconcentric circles\u201d with the EU and the euro at the core and Britain in a second ring. If this is the case, it will be a major boost to Theresa May, who has been hoping to strengthen her hand in negotiations by persuading individual leaders that a decent Brexit deal for Britain will be good for the EU. Will Barnier\u2019s Brexit boost to the pound last? Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says there will be more volatility in the weeks ahead: Many investors would be wondering whether Barnier\u2019s statement could be a turning point for the pound. Although many issues related to trade and the Irish border are far from being resolved, it currently seems that negotiations may begin moving in the right direction. If positive news flows continue when Brexit secretary Dominic Raab heads back to Brussels on Friday to resume talks, GBPUSD may quickly return to July highs that were above 1.33. However, expect volatility to surge in the coming weeks as we get closer to the Brexit deadline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Just as fears were mounting that Britain is on course to crash out of Europe without a deal, Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, took markets by surprise with a more optimistic view. Specifically, Barnier said: We are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country. The comment on Wednesday has pushed the pound back above the $1.30 mark (currently at $1.3033), and up against the euro at \u20ac1.1133. As Viraj Patel, Foreign Exchange Strategist at ING explains, the optimistic intervention was unexpected: GBP markets were caught off guard as the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said they were \u201cready to propose a partnership the likes of which has not existed before with any third country\u201d. This is something that most hadn\u2019t thought was possible and may trigger a partial reassessment of no deal Brexit risks that lends support to a politically-infested pound. While we\u2019re not jumping to any conclusions about the actual final Brexit deal (this remains highly complex), constructive comments by Barnier (and Brexit secretary Raab) suggesting that negotiations remain on track \u2013 and a deal can be achieved \u2013 may be enough to ruffle the feathers of speculative GBP markets that have latched onto a bearish no deal Brexit story.

It usually only pays part of its annual profit to farmers but said it was making an exception this year as the industry struggles to pick up the pieces after a blazing hot summer. The proposal will be discussed at the next board meeting in October and, if approved, the money would be paid out in March 2019. \u201cOur balance sheet has improved significantly over the last few years, and the strength of our balance sheet makes room for this extraordinary initiative while still maintaining our investment plans for the continued future growth of the company,\u201d said the chief executive, Peder Tuborgh.

    "webTitle": "Npower-SSE merger wins go-ahead from competition watchdog", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog has provisionally given the green light to the merger of npower and the retail arm of SSE, removing the final hurdle to the biggest shakeup of the energy sector in years. An investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority found that the two firms did not compete closely for customers on default tariffs which most people are on. Few people switched between the pair, it added. Households on those tariffs would also soon be protected by the government\u2019s price cap, the authority said in a provisional finding. The inquiry was launched after the CMA raised concerns that billpayers on default tariffs would end up paying higher prices due to a substantial decrease in competition from the merger. However, Anne Lambert, chair of the CMA\u2019s inquiry group, said: \u201cOur analysis shows that the merger will not impact how SSE and npower set their standard variable tariff [default] prices because they are not close rivals for these customers.\u201d The approval from the watchdog clears the German-owned npower and UK-listed SSE to create a behemoth with 11 million customers that is second in size behind market leader British Gas, which has 12.6 million. The merger is expected to complete in the last quarter of 2018 or first quarter of 2019. The big six will then shrink to the big five, though challenger companies including Ovo, First Utility and Bulb are not far behind. SSE said it was pleased by the CMA\u2019s finding. \u201cThe planned transaction presents a great opportunity to create a more agile, innovative and efficient company that really delivers for customers and the energy market as a whole,\u201d said Alistair Phillips-Davies, the firm\u2019s chief executive. Innogy SE, npower\u2019s parent company, said the verdict was an important milestone and its plans for the merger were on schedule. The 34.4% stake held by Innogy SE in the new company is slated to be transferred over to rival German energy firm E.ON next year, as part of a huge asset swap between E.ON and Innogy SE owner RWE. The CMA merger inquiry looked at whether the market consolidation would lead to bigger rises in default tariffs, or to hikes being announced earlier. It concluded neither prospect was likely, because the large suppliers benchmark their prices against all the other big players rather than one specific firm. But consumer group Which? said it would be \u201cwatching closely\u201d to see whether households faced higher energy prices as a a result of the merger going ahead. Labour said the decision was concerning and warned that consumers could suffer from poor service if the merger resulted in job cuts. Alan Whitehead, shadow energy minister, said: \u201cGiven that both of these companies already struggle to provide good customer service, job losses in customer care as well as other departments must be avoided at all costs.\u201d There are now 72 domestic energy suppliers for consumers to choose from, according to the CMA. Comparison site MoneySuperMarket said that gave people a \u201csignificant\u201d number of alternatives if the newly merged firm was too expensive. One cloud facing the new company is Theresa May\u2019s price cap on default tariffs, also known as standard variable tariffs, which is due to take effect at the end of the year. The prime minister promised that consumers on SVTs will save up to \u00a3100 on their annual bill, which will hit profit margins at the big six. With more than two thirds of its customers on SVTs, SSE is heavily exposed to the cap. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cShould the cap be more severe than expected, the new business would face a fresh headwind from day one.\u201d The merged company will be headed by the first woman to be a chief executive at a a large supplier, Katie Bickerstaffe, the former chief executive of Dixons Carphone.",

      "bodyText": "Vodafone Australia and TPG Telecom have agreed to merge into a single $15bn telecommunications company that could provide a serious competitor to Telstra and Optus and help lower prices for consumers. The two companies confirmed to the Australian Securities Exchange on Thursday that they plan an all-stock merger-of-equals after discussions last week. Under the deal, TPG shareholders will own 49.9% of the group, with Vodafone Australia shareholders owning 50.1%. The merged company \u2013 to be called TPG Telecom Limited \u2013 will have a combined value of about $15bn and annual revenue of $6bn. TPG is Australia\u2019s second largest internet service provider, with more than 1.9 million subscribers, while Vodafone is the third largest mobile operator with 6 million subscribers. I\u00f1aki Berroeta, the chief executive of Vodafone Australia \u2013 jointly owned by the British company Vodafone and Hong Kong\u2019s CK Hutchison, said the biggest winners from the deal would be consumers because the combined entity would be able to give the market leaders Telstra and Optus a run for their money. \u201cThe combination of the two companies will create an organisation with the necessary scale, breadth and financial strength for the future,\u201d Berroeta said. \u201cThe equal terms of the combination preserves the competitive strengths of the two businesses, meaning a sustainable long-term fixed/mobile competitor to Telstra and Optus.\u201d Berroeta is expected to stay on as boss of the merged group, while TPG\u2019s chief and chairman, David Teoh, is set to become chairman. Through a series of acquisitions, TPG has a 11,000km-long fibre network providing wholesale broadband services to businesses. But it wants to branch out into retail with a fibre-to the-building offer which could provide fast, cheap broadband to up to 500,000 apartment blocks in major cities, analysts say. Combined with Vodafone\u2019s mobile spread \u2013 it has 19% of the market \u2013 TPG\u2019s broadband could help attract customers disaffected with Telstra and Optus although Telstra shares soared on the news because investors now expect TPG to withdraw ultra-cheap discounts such as its $9.99 montly mobile offer. \u201cWhen you combine the fixed and mobile assets, the new TPG would be in a proper position to deal with Optus ... and a full-fleged telecom operation,\u201d Bernstein analyst Samuel Chen said. The merger deal is expected to be completed next year, subject to approval from regulators including the Foreign Investment Review Board and the competition watchdog. Parallel to the merger agreement, TPG and Vodafone Australia have also signed a joint venture agreement to acquire a 5G spectrum at a federal government auction later this year.",
